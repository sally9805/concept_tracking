The night Davis and I told our father we wanted a bomb shelter , I sat in silence at the dinner table , listening for sounds from my mother 's bedroom . I watched my father butter his bread . I watched Davis sort through his 3-D cards , whose deep focal views  --  a fisherman with the Hoover Dam behind him , a comet flaming through the gaseous clouds of the Milky Way  --  were supposed to strengthen his lazy eye . He wore a brown patch taped to his glasses . <p> Then Davis stacked his cards into a pile and opened his Superboy comic . On its back cover , an advertisement pictured a boy laughing at a postman who was coming up the sidewalk , toting a heavy parcel that shouted , " Help ! Help ! I 'm Trapped Inside ! " You Can Learn to Throw Your Voice ! the ad said . <p> If Mom saw Davis reading in the dark , I thought , she would turn on a lamp . But since her mother 's death the previous month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turn on a lamp , " I told Davis . <p> After dinner , our father watched a rerun of Gunsmoke . Davis sat beside him , holding the booklet , Your Survival in Nuclear Attack that the Civil Defense warden had distributed chat afternoon at school . The first through sixth grades  --  Davis was in sixth , I was a year younger  --  had assembled in the school , cafeteria . Then the warden turned off the lights and showed us a picture of a cloud surging violently upward , as though , through enormous pressure , it had suddenly released itself from the hard darkness of the earth 's core . Yet as the cloud rose , it grew calmer , spreading our lazily in all directions , like a summer cloud carrying its dream-cargo of familiar faces . When the lights came on , some students told the warden what they 'd seen within the mushroom cap : someone had seen Abe Lincoln 's face as it appeared on a penny ; someone had seen his mother 's . It was a mistake , the warden said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud 's tendency to drift was actually its greatest danger . He showed pictures of cows lying dead in fields outside Hiroshima and Nagasaki . <p> " Boom ! " Davis shouted as we walked home . As we turned onto our block , he began pretending the bomb had already fallen , and that he was weakening with each step taken , as if our house were somehow radioactive , although he 'd said we were rushing toward its safety . By the time he reached our sidewalk , he was staggering on his knees , his arms outspread . When he got to the front stoop , he lurched and fell forward . " Water ! " he cried . " Water ! I must have a drink or I 'll die ! " <p> " Quiet , " I said . " I think Mom 's sleeping . " Her Venetian blinds were drawn . The sprinkler , left on since morning , was coursing slowly back and forth , flooding the front lawn . <p> When our father got home from work , he made us one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with hot dogs chopped up in them . Then he suggested we watch TV . <p> " Dad , " Davis said , interrupting Gunsmoke. awe have to build a bomb shelter . " He showed him a picture of a suburban family secure within their cement-block basement shelter . The parents looked as if they 'd just come home from a cocktail party . The father , standing over his two sons asleep in bunkbeds , was testing their radiation levels with a dosimeter . The mother , sitting on a daybed , was examining a selection of magazines fanned out across a Danish Modern coffee table . The shelter was small and compact , like the Shasta travel trailer we 'd rented the previous summer . My mother had hated the trailer , with its cramped interior , and its flimsy dinette that folded into a narrow double bed . But I had liked the way I would wake at night to the sound of everyone breathing . <p> Our father said , " I 'm watching my show . Not now . " <p> On Gunsmoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a madman who waved a gun in her face . " No ! " ! Miss Kitty swore . " You 'll never make me tell ! " She wore one of her beautiful dancehall dresses , lacy ruffles cascading from its bodice . She did n't know that Matt Dillon , who was supposed to save her , was lying wounded in the desert . <p> I heard my mother get up and click on the radio in her bedroom . It spilled out news . She turned the dial to Make-Believe Ballroom , broadcast nightly from a hotel in downtown Baltimore . The band was playing " Stardust "  --  Sometimes I wonder why I spend  --  the lonely nights  --  dreaming of a song . . . <p> " The warden gave us a letter you have to sign , " I told my father . <p> But he was watching TV , lost in his show . He is not prepared , I thought . He will be one of those people the warden warned us about , one of those people who imagines he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nowhere 's safer than our Country Squire , " he 'd once reassured me as we drove at night through lightning . But as he spoke , the headlights of an approaching car tore through our car 's interior , illuminating the sudden boundaries of his body . <p> " The school has to know whether to keep us there or send us home when the bomb falls , " I told him . <p> " You have to check a box on a note they gave us , " Davis said . Then he began reading aloud from the Civil Defense booklet : " ' A dual-usage approach to shelter protection is highly desirable .. The protected space can be used for other normal day-to-day activities , such as guest room , recreation room . . . " ' <p> " Look , Davis , there 's Chester , " our father said . Davis loved Chester , Matt Dillon 's crippled deputy . Chester was the reason Davis watched Gunsmoke . The day our father built our log-cabin playhouse , Davis had limped around the backyard shouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> But now Davis was becoming panicked . He started crying . <p> My mother clicked off her radio . I heard her go into the bathroom and begin drawing her bath . <p> " All right , Davis , do n't cry , " our father said . " Let me see the letter . " <p> " You have to tell Mom to buy food for the shelter , " Davis told him . " You have to tell Mom to buy food in cans . " <p> Our father unfolded the dittoed paper : " Dear Parent(s) or Legal Guardian(s) , " he read aloud . Then he asked for a pen . <p> " Now let me watch my show , " he said . When he handed the letter back to Davis , I saw he had checked the box that said " Go-Home Plan . " <p> That night I lay awake for a long time , listening to people laugh on TV . <p> For a long time , I studied a white shirt that hung , faintly moving , on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white shirt , the more it seemed to sway , as though it were a speechless figure that wanted to whisper me its secret . <p> Shh , I wanted to whisper back  --  Be quiet , be still . My mother 's grief was traveling through the wall . As it entered , it penetrated every object in my room  --  the yellow curtains , the wooden wind chimes , the ticking dock . It gathered in the folds of my rumpled sheet , and everywhere my sheet touched me along my legs , my upper arms  --  I could feel her grief 's soft weight descending . The sheet grew heavy . It overwhelmed me . I pulled it tight and wrapped myself within it . <p> Then I heard " The Star-Spangled Banner " playing on TV . <p> " Come on , old boy , " I heard my father say . " Let 's make sure the doors are locked . " He was talking to our cocker spaniel , Mickey . <p> The house grew quiet . I lay suspended within the loose web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered my mother 's name  --  Marie , Marie  --  but nothing happened . Then I started to wonder if she 'd sleep late the next day , or if she 'd get up early , as she had that morning , to say goodbye to Davis and me before we left for school . Weary and sleepless , she 'd emerged from her bedroom , wearing her housecoat and slippers . She 'd sat at the kitchen table . <p> I made her instant coffee . Meanwhile , she withdrew her mother 's sterling compact from her housecoat pocket and studied herself in its foggy mirror , touching a fingertip to the flecks of dried mascara that still clung to her lashes . <p> " Whenever I looked at myself too much , " she said , " Dear always told me that beauty was only skin deep . I used to think she was trying to tell me that I was ugly . " Dear was her mother  --  Dear One , Dear Me , Dearest of Us All . Dear had died in the sanatorium she had entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see my mother 's unwashed Welcome Wagon Chevy . The previous Memorial Day , my father had chauffeured us  --  the car was a two-tone convertible , turquoise and black , with Welcome Wagon painted on each door  --  in a parade sponsored by the Wheaton Merchants Association . My mother had sat in back , on the folded convertible top , with Davis and me on either side of her , tossing zippered change purses SAVE FOR A DREAMHOUSE ! Suburban Trust Bank  --  to families sitting in lawn chairs along the curbs . Beneath her Welcome Wagon sash , she 'd worn a brilliant blue dress , appliqued with silver leaves . <p> Now she lit a Parliament . <p> " Do n't smoke , " Davis said . " It 's not healthy . " <p> " Do n't tell her what to do , " I said . <p> " Look , " she said . She was turning Dear 's compact in her hand . As she turned it , a shard of white light danced across the kitchen wall  --  then it lighted briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ceiling . <p> Davis whispered , " Do n't you care if Mom smokes ? " <p> " I put a holy card from Dear 's funeral in a time capsule , " I told my mother . It was true . Davis and I sometimes put wallet-sized school photos of ourselves in old mayonnaise jars . Then we wrapped the jars in aluminum foil and buried them in the backyard , so people of the future would find them and see what we had looked like . " She 's only hurting herself , " Davis said loudly . <p> My mother looked at me . " Your first day of school , " she said , " I watched you from my bedroom window as you walked up the hill in your red reversible jacket . When you got to the top , you stopped and took off your jacket . He 's changed his mind , I thought . But you turned your jacket inside out and put it on again , so that you were wearing the side that was blue . I watched you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Did you watch me , too ? " Davis said . <p> " Yes , I watched you , too . " <p> After school , Davis and I went down to the laundry room to begin the bomb shelter . We cleared our father 's workbench of the birdhouses he was building . In their place , we spread our roughly drawn floor plan for a six-by-nine-foot bunker , a right-angled baffle wall to protect us from deadly radiation 's unbending light . <p> " Put down the masking tape , " Davis said . <p> I laid masking tape along the floor to mark where the cinder-block walls would go . Within the taped borders , Davis chalked outlines of the furniture we 'd planned  --  two sets of bunkbeds , a table and four chairs , and a garbage can that would serve as our toilet . We tried to decide if we should hang draperies against one wall , to give us the illusion of having a picture window , an idea I 'd once seen in House Beautiful . <p> " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to think of foods my mother might like , but then I felt I ought to hurry  --  we were working quickly , as if the bomb were already coming  --  so I copied a list of provisions from Your Survival in Nuclear Attack : sweetened condensed milk , nonfat dry milk , Spanish rice ( canned ) , Chicken-'n ' - Dumplings ( canned ) , fruit cocktail ( cans or glass jars ) , creamed corn , wax beans , strawberry jam , canned beat ( STERNO ) . . . According to the booklet , our family 's survival would depend upon strengthening our ability to anticipate all manner of emergencies : we 'd need spare blankets , of course , and a transistor radio with a back-up set of batteries . <p> But first , we would need to establish a regular schedule for family conferences , in which we could sit down to discuss our needs quite openly , so we could plan for disaster accordingly . For instance , we 'd need to determine the sorts of things that might sustain our family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that might maintain its morale , such as the playing of Old Maid and Parcheesi . In later sessions , we 'd need to assess the psychological pressures we 'd face , due to sickness , confinement , and rationing , and to reach at least some tentative accord as to whether we should shoot our family dog , for reasons of sanitation . Finally , we would need even to decide what we would do if one of us should die , and to determine if we felt it was necessary to arm ourselves against our neighbors , including the women and children . <p> When Davis finished with the chalk , he told me to bring the booklet and get into the shelter . I followed the masking tape line that outlined the baffle wall . I fumed the comer and sat on the concrete floor . <p> Davis read from the booklet : " Some people believe if they are exposed to radiation , they will immediately become " walking stoves , " emitting radiation and endangering all those with whom they come into contact . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . Above us , in her bedroom , I could hear our mother rearranging furniture , making room for a Victorian shaving stand she 'd inherited from Dear . <p> " Close your eyes , " Davis said . <p> I closed my eyes and thought about Dear . The last time we 'd seen her , she had moved into the basement of her deteriorating Brooklyn brownstone  --  none of the upstairs bathrooms still worked . She 'd sat on a roll-away bed , clutching the black handbag in which she kept what she called her " serious jewelry . " <p> " I thought you 'd decided not to come , " she 'd said . Across the bed she had spread old manila envelopes , which she 'd secured with ancient rubber bands . She said she had been working on a letter to some lawyer who wanted to harm her . <p> Her dinner service came to us  --  Limoges , for thirty-six . <p> " Dear always tried to buy happiness , " my mother once told me , fixing her long hair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now our house was filling antiques and stray objects that seemed barely freed from the close air of Dear 's diminished life : twin cut-glass vases , stuffed v " dusty artificial roses ; a brass statuette of the fallen gladiator , which Dear had kept by her bed . Well , happiness  --  now my mother spent hours in her bedroom , sorting through Dear 's effects : a paper bag filled with soiled lace collars ; a print of a sullen Baby Jesus , " The Light of the World " ; a violet Louis Sherry candy box overflowing with costume jewelry , with cocktail rings and fancy brooches fashioned from glass as blue and lurid as a doll 's opened eyes . <p> But there would be no room for these things in the shelter . We will have to be like pioneers , I thought , casting the heavy load from our covered wagon so we can ford the rising river . I shifted and opened my eyes . There was Davis , sitting beside me . But there was no shelter . There was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rag bag hanging from a nail in the wall . <p> " What is it ? " Davis asked . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Then keep your eyes closed . Imagine what it 'll be like . " <p> At first , I could not envision it . The basement smelled musty . It smelled of the firewood and old newspapers our father had stacked beneath the stairs . <p> Then it came : I saw the fireball , the blast surge , and the white cloud rising . I leaned back against the wall . I saw us in the shelter waiting the long weeks for fallout to settle . I saw us climbing the basement stairs and opening the door onto the bright light of a world made immaculate by a force greater than ten suns . I knew then that the world that would await us was not a world of charred remains and ghastly rubble , like the photos the Civil Defense warden had shown us of orphans digging through the ashes of Hiroshima . Our world would not be so much destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our world would be so new , in fact , that we would be able to choose a car  --  any car , a Thunderbird convertible , perhaps  --  and drive all the way across the country to San Francisco . Our father would sing as he drove . He would put the top down . Our mother would untie her nylon scarf and let her hair fly freely in the breeze . She 'd say , " Let 's sit in back , boys , and have our own private parade , " and the three of us would sit there , waving to no one  --  waving to the sea and sky , waving to the dream clouds  --  as we crossed the Golden Gate Bridge . When we arrived , we 'd find the city intact , a Lost Colony whose settlers had disappeared with no sign of struggle or distress , and we , the earth 's last inhabitants , the born-again , would wander down its broad avenues  --  avenues as clean and quiet and empty as the Grand Canyon . There would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my mother would be restored to us , at last released from the spell of a past I believed she still loved ? Or did I simply think she 'd die of grief ? Sometimes , on my way home from school , I stopped at Wheaton Florists , where , for twenty-five cents , I could buy three long , imperfect sterns of gladiolus . <p> I carried them home , their red blooms flaring inside green tissue . <p> " Mom , " I called out , pressing our front door buzzer like a delivery boy . But she did n't answer . <p> I went down to the shelter , where Davis helped me fill emptied Clorox bottles with fresh water  --  a drop of bleach left in an unrinsed Clorox bottle , I had read , would extend the water 's shelf life to infinity , almost . <p> But each time we asked our father when we could actually begin the shelter 's construction , he said only , " Do n't talk about the shelter to your mother . " He told us she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't herself . He said she might take the train to New York City , as she 'd done each month when Dear was sick , so she could see Charmaine , her baby sister . " We can still have fun , " he promised as he cooked dinner . " We can go to the Enchanted Forest . " <p> But at night I sometimes heard them arguing . " But Dear was my family , " my mother would insist . <p> " Then I guess I 'm the one who should leave , " he 'd answer . <p> Afterwards , I 'd hear her in the kitchen , listening to the radio . Mom , I 'd think , as though I might possess a clairvoyant 's power to reach her even through silence to say  --  to say what ? Mom , I 'd think , over and over  --  Mom , Mom . <p> " I think Mom 's almost better , " I told Davis one afternoon . I was sitting within the shelter 's masking tape lines , memorizing the air-raid warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red signal , " a rising and falling siren lasting three minutes , meant take immediate cover ; the " white signal , " three one-minute siren blasts with intervals between them , meant all-clear . Davis was waterproofing kitchen matches by dipping them in melted wax , a trick he 'd read about in Boy 's Life . <p> " No , she 's the same , " Davis said . Increasingly , he seemed annoyed with her . Sometimes , when she came to his room to say goodnight , he did n't answer his door . She 'd tap again lightly  --  Davis , Davis . <p> He gathered the matches into a pile . " Anyway , it does n't really matter , " he said . He lit a match and blew it out . Then he lit another . <p> " Davis , " I said . <p> " It 's true , " he said suddenly , dropping a match to the concrete floor , where it kept burning . Then he said , " Listen , if they split up , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what to say . I thought of our mother sitting upstairs , unprotected . Each afternoon , when I came home from school , I 'd find her sitting in her wing chair , reading one of her paperback novels  --  Marjorie Morningstar , or The Robe . Sometimes she seemed the lonely empress of a lost kingdom ; other times she simply seemed tired and old , like Dear . One day the sirens will go off , I thought . She will look up briefly , confused by a disturbance that she does n't understand . Then she will turn the page of her novel . She 'll go on reading . <p> I looked at Davis . " You should n't even think like that , " I told him . <p> We collected the waterproofed matches and stored them in a metal Band-Aid box . Then we went outside . It was only two o'clock . But the sky was already darkening , filling quickly with dense smoke . <p> " We 'd better hurry , " Davis said . In the woods that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning the Haunted House for practice . <p> By the time we arrived , the Haunted House , as we kids c ailed it  --  it was actually a wooden farmhouse , abandoned so long ago that no one knew who 'd lived there  --  was already burning . When I saw it , 1 thought of the phrase out of control . But then I saw the firemen were busily hosing the underbrush and scrub pines , so the fire would n't spread to the woods . <p> " That house is a mess , " I heard a woman say . <p> " It 's about time someone burned it , " the woman behind her agreed . She said she hated even to imagine the poor woman who 'd once lived there , whoever she was , because a house like that was a monster , a real ten-ton dust trap . She said her own house  --  a split-foyer , in a nearby subdivision called Foxmoor  --  had an all-electric kitchen and two sliding glass doors . <p> " That 's certainly much nicer , " another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 'd come to the grand opening of a shopping center . Some mothers were pushing strollers . <p> But while they talked , the Haunted House burned . I thought of the summer afternoons when Davis and I had played there , sitting in its cool dirt-floored cellar , where we 'd found what looked like butterfly nets , or combing its vine-choked yard for blue medicine bottles and dinosaur bones . Once , we 'd even found a pair of broken spectacles beneath the front steps . " Put on those glasses , " my mother told us when we brought them home , " and you 'll see through a dead man 's eyes . " <p> Now the Haunted House would be replaced by a new cluster of split-levels . <p> " Look ! " a boy shouted . An upstairs windows suddenly exploded . Then they all went , one by one , like gunshot blasts . " Stand back ! Clear away ! " the firemen shouted . They moved forward to hose the roof , but the roof collapsed onto the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our heads , carried into the woods by a gentle breeze . Soon the leaves were covered with ash . The ash mixed with yellow pollen . <p> I raised my hand . Flecks of ash caught on my palm . Whichever way the wind blows , I thought , the fallout will find us . It will rise and gather in rain clouds . It will fall in dean rain . No one will see it or feel it . No one will know what has happened until it 's too late . <p> I looked at the house  --  it was quickly burning . Each time a smoking timber fell , it hissed in a pool of water the firemen had hosed , and the crowd hissed back in imitation . Meanwhile , the ash kept blowing backwards , over our heads , back through the woods , back through the streets , back over the power lines and onto the roofs of our houses and the elementary school . I knew where it was heading . It was falling through the high limbs of our willow tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drifting through our screened-in porch like black snow . <p> When we got home , our mother was not in her bedroom . <p> She was in the kitchen , making spaghetti . She had set the table with a red-checked cloth and an empty Chianti bottle into which she 'd placed a white candle . She was holding her highball glass  --  part of a set that Dear had sent her , a dozen matched pieces , each imprinted with the seal of Monaco to celebrate the marriage of Princess Grace . <p> " She 's drinking , " Davis whispered . <p> She turned to greet us . " Let 's sit in the living room , " she said . <p> " Not now , " Davis told her . He said he needed to listen to his shortwave . <p> It was almost five o'clock . I knelt with my mother on the living room sofa , facing backwards , so we could look out the picture window . Across the street , Linda Novotney was sitting on her front stoop , brushing her baby doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told my mother . I wanted to ask if she remembered the time weld-found the broken spectacles and how she had told us that we could see through a dead man 's eyes . <p> But she was n't really listening . " My mother and I used to sit in the window like this , " she said . <p> She lit a cigarette . She said , " We 'd sit in the front window and wait for my father to come home . My mother always told me you had to wish the next car would be his . You really had to wish it . Then , if it was n't the next car , it would be the one after that . " <p> She said that had happened a long time ago , in the time before her parents separated . After their separation , she said , her parents saw each other only one more time , " like ships that pass in the night . " <p> But at dinner , she was silent . Our father pushed his food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful dinner , " he said . " It 's very good . " <p> " Dinner 's really good , " I told her . But I was actually watching Davis , who was watching our mother each time she refilled her wineglass . <p> Davis stopped eating . " Dad , " he said , putting down his knife and fork , " supposing a bomb falls and you ca n't get home from work in time ? " <p> " Davis , " our father said . <p> " Dear was terrified of German dirigibles , " our mother said . " During the war , she installed blackout curtains on every window in our house . My uncle Carl was the block warden  --  ' There go the sirens , Marie , shut the curtains before Uncle Carl walks by and catches us ! ' It was romantic . We sat in the dark and listened to Frank Sinatra . We called him ' the Voice . " ' <p> I wanted to be sitting with her in Brooklyn . Dear would be there .

" <p> " Davis , " I told him . <p> For a moment , my mother looked at Davis in silence , as if she had no idea what he was talking about . <p> " Maybe we should stay at school when the bomb falls , " Davis said . <p> " He 's talking about Civil Defense , " our father explained . " The school wants them to know what to do if a bomb should fall , so that they 'll feel safe . . . " <p> My mother shut her eyes . She repeated the word " safe " as if it were something dangerous . I could n't tell what she was thinking . <p> Yes , I wanted to tell her . We 'll be safe . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls . <p> She looked up at our father . " Is that the plan ? " she said suddenly .

But he was too late . <p> She stood up , crying , and turned to leave the room . <p> He got up to follow . At the dining-room doorway , he stopped . " You should be doing your eye exercises , " he told Davis . <p> As for me : I did n't know what to do . I slowly cleared the table and stacked the dishes in the sink . <p> Then I went down to the basement and sat within the shelter 's masking tape lines . We will come here after the bomb falls , I thought . We 'll open a can of beef stew and heat it over Sterno . We 'll heat it over Sterno and serve it on paper plates .

After dinner , we will play Parcheesi . <p> Davis came downstairs with his 3-D cards . He sat beside me , studying the cards , moving them back and forth in front of his face . " Do you know the hot-water heater holds forty gallons ? " I asked him . " Forty gallons would last us exactly twenty days . " <p> I heard my father go into the living room and switch on the TV . I went upstairs and out to the backyard . I looked up at my mother 's window . That night , although I did n't know it yet , there were still years to come before my father left us . There were still years before my mother really started drinking . <p> It was eight o'clock . It was getting dark . My mother had turned on a light and shut her blinds . <p> When it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand here and see shooting stars . I thought of Mrs. Harrison , my fifth-grade teacher , asking the class if we thought the night sky would be lovelier if we could see a dozen brightly colored planets every night , or if the lonely moon , waning and waxing all on its own , was the loveliest thing of all , because it was just one thing , set off by itself to admire . <p> I saw a book of matches my father had left on the back steps and put it in my pocket . I opened the door beneath the screened-in porch and went in on my knees through the crawl space . The crawl space smelled of creosote , which my father had painted on the exposed wood of the porch 's foundation . In back , behind the lawn mower , was a musty towel in which Davis and I had hidden a box of sparklers left over from the Fourth of July . <p> Standing in the backyard , I lit a sparkler . " Look , Mom , look ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She opened her blinds and peered out from between the slats . <p> " I 'm writing your name ! " I said . " Can you see it ?

The white smoke that spelled her name disintegrated as it rose . <p> I lit another sparkler . I drew it in a circle around what remained of her name , as though the white smoke of the drifting circle might contain her name forever , holding it securely in place . <p> <p> By Richard McCann <p>
