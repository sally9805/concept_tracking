The singer Seal has always seemed to draw on his own private power source , so it should come as no surprise that his recent performance on MTV 's acoustic showcase , Unplugged , was suffused with energy despite the de rigueur absence of electric guitars ( the segment begins airing this week ) . But what is surprising is just how gracefully Seal took to the format . Tuneful , enigmatically romantic songs such as Kiss from a Rose blossomed under the scrutiny that a lower-volume set brings , and Seal 's voice , charismatic and craggy , revealed new depths in the low-key format , especially on his climactic rendition of Do n't Cry . <P> Seal 's show was not only a high point in his career and for Unplugged , it was also a noteworthy moment for today 's pop . The sound of folk is making a comeback , from the resurgent Tracy Chapman 's unexpected Top 10 CD , New Beginning , to the folk-punk punch of Ani DiFranco . In his Unplugged set , the musically eclectic Seal ( according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving art-pop CD , Emperor Tomato Ketchup ; D*Note 's politically aware dance album , Criminal Justice ; and Henryk Gorecki 's avant-garde classical CD , Symphony No. 3 ) managed to draw from disparate strains of pop and weave them into a single folksy tapestry , performing a bluesy cover of Jimi Hendrix 's Stone Free as well as a folk- soul rendering of his own hit Prayer for the Dying . <P> The folk-pop sound is n't a watering down of rock but a maturation of the form , connecting pop to its past and giving it a future among adults . Seal , born in London to Nigerian parents , admits that he began singing so his " distant " father would notice him . With his Unplugged show , Seal should win the ear of many more adults .  --  C.J.F.
