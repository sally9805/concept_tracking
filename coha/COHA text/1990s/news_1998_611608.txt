<p> Late in 1960 , Father Bryan O. Walsh agreed to a request that he find homes in America for Cuban children fleeing the new Communist government in Cuba . Over the next 20 months , that simple promise would set in motion a project called " Pedro Pan , " which brought 14,000 Cuban children between ages 6 and 18 to Florida . <p> Memories of those early days of the Pedro Pan project have been rekindled in recent days as some of the children , now mostly in their forties and fifties , returned to their homeland to see Pope John Paul II . <p> Other memories have been stirred recently as well . Some Pedro Pans , as they call themselves still , have aired worries that they may have been sent abroad back then because the CIA planted rumors that President Fidel Castro planned to take them from their families in the name of socialist training and collectivization . <p> In any case , the Pedro Pan project started with a telephone call that went out to Walsh from the State Department on Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charities for the Miami Archdiocese , to find accommodations  --  beginning the next day  --  for 200 children who had been granted exit visas . <p> " There was no time to consult with the archbishop , " recalled Walsh , now a 67-year-old retired monsignor . " And I was not especially anxious to consult with him . " <p> Instead , the young priest began a frantic search for temporary housing , quickly securing space at a Catholic girls ' boarding school , whose students were at home for the holidays , and in an unused mansion owned by the soon-to-be Cuban American mayor of Miami , Maurice Ferre . <p> Walsh enlisted the aid of a Catholic Charities social worker . Together they went to Miami International Airport on Christmas afternoon , only to discover that none of the three daily flights from Cuba bore any refugee children . But the next day , five children arrived . By the end of the week , two dozen were in Walsh 's care . <p> About that time , the late Archbishop Coleman Carroll called Walsh , asking if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to reach you about taking in 200 children . " <p> " Oh yeah , I meant to tell you about that , " stammered Walsh . " I have made a commitment in our behalf , " thinking to himself that " saving 200 children from communism is worth my career . " <p> Instead of a rebuke , the archbishop asked Walsh , " Why did you place a limit of 200 children ? Take them all , take them all . " <p> Thus what began as a trickle of youngsters erupted into a flood when stories out of Havana reported that the Cuban government , which had closed all Catholic schools , planned to take away parental rights of dissidents , perhaps even ship the children off to Russia . <p> In recent years , some of the Pedro Pans have come to believe that that rumor was planted by the Central Intelligence Agency to whip up opposition to Castro a year after his January 1959 takeover . One , Maria de los Angeles Torres , a political science professor at DePaul University in Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking that the CIA be required to produce any documents related to the program . <p> A CIA spokesman , Tom Crispell , said Friday the agency " has no relevant documents on the subject . " <p> Walsh said he has no personal knowledge of CIA involvement . But he added : " Not to have had the CIA at least watching would be ridiculous . " In addition , he said some parents who were cooperating with the CIA in Cuba obviously were anxious to get their children to a safe environment . <p> In a little over a week after its inception , the burgeoning project suffered a setback . On Jan. 3 , 1961 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke diplomatic relations with Cuba , just hours after Castro demanded that the American Embassy staff in Havana be reduced to 11 . With the embassy closed , no more visas could be granted . <p> But Walsh and State Department officials worked out a procedure by which the department granted " waivers , " in the form of a letter signed by Walsh , that said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waivers were slipped into Cuba in diplomatic pouches of supportive nations whose embassies in Havana remained open . <p> The waivers were distributed through an underground network to parents seeking to have their children emigrate . American corporations doing business in Havana helped finance the project , sending money to Walsh , who bought plane tickets through a travel agency in Havana . Departing in small groups , the children sneaked out of the Havana airport , bound for Miami , either directly or via Jamaica . <p> The original plan was for the children to be reunited with their parents in a matter of months , and nearly half rejoined their families in less than a year . <p> But the departure of many parents was delayed because of crackdowns on emigration from Cuba that followed the Bag of Pigs invasion in April 1961 and by an American embargo imposed in 1962 . <p> So what Walsh figured would be a few months of foster care for the remaining 7,000 children turned , in some instances , into years . Some of their parents never left the Caribbean island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami , Walsh asked 100 Catholic Charity agencies in 35 states to find homes for the children , and the U.S. government financed an airlift of the children . The government also provided a stipend for the unaccompanied children , which Walsh distributed to the various agencies and individuals who took them in . <p> About 5,000 children were resettled outside the Miami area . When their parents finally arrived  --  most of them in a 1965 exodus called Freedom Flights , ending a three-year hiatus on emigration  --  Walsh urged them to settle in the towns where their children were living . <p> " That 's why , to this day , you 'll find colonies of Cubans in places such as Yakima , Wash. , Wilmington , Del. , Toledo and Indianapolis , " Walsh explained with a smile . <p> By June 1966 , only 500 children remained in foster situations , and many of those " hard cases " wound up in the personal care of Walsh . <p> " He was my family , " said Maximo Castaneda , who lived with Walsh for 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest place near downtown Miami . <p> " We drove him nuts , " recalled Castaneda , a 36-year-old maintenance employee of Miami-Dade Community College who said there were 40 boys in the motel , three to a room . <p> Walsh 's care has been rewarded by former Pedro Pans who have named a number of their sons Bryan and by more than two dozen former charges who are priests . Many of the Pedro Pans rose to success in Miami and elsewhere . <p> Former Pedro Pans have been elected to city , county and state offices in Florida . One-time Pedro Pans include a federal judge in Philadelphia and several judges in California and Florida . <p> At a testimonial reception honoring Walsh in October , former Pedro Pans presented him with a check for $ 30,000 , to help finance his dream of a permanent home for the next wave of children in need . <p> " You touched the lives of three generations of Cubans , " said Tomas Regalado , a radio commentator who as vice mayor of Miami gave Walsh a medallion and proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he and then-Miami Mayor Joe Carollo , both Pedro Pans , " were bewildered at everything we saw " in their new homeland . <p> " Now , " Regalado noted , " Pedro Pans now are the government of Miami . " <p> Miami real estate broker Elly Chovel , 50 , called Walsh " a miracle worker . " Like the Biblical parable of the loaves and fishes , " he multiplied by 200 " the number of children that were rescued by the program . <p> But there was one miracle that Walsh was n't able to pull off . <p> Walsh had hoped to see the pope in Cuba this month , but after finally getting a visa on Thursday , it was rescinded three hours later . Walsh said the same thing happened to him in 1982 , when he first was granted , and then denied , a visa to attend the installation of Jamie Ortega as archbishop of Havana . Walsh has been to Cuba once  --  a hurriedly arranged one-day trip in 1963 to attend the funeral of the Cuban archbishop @
