FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE AERYK Severance had been looking for the doorway into Faerie . He knew it was there . He had known ever since the day of his mother 's funeral , when he was five years old . First Mary Pratt had told him-Mary Pratt , his fellow searcher and his guide , who at six was pretty even then , and who in later years would be his lover . And then his murdered mother had come to tell him it was true . Ever since that day he 'd searched , and in his searchings he 'd learned one thing for sure : somehow the doorway was linked to music , and to madness , and to love . Mary Pratt became his guide because of all the people he had known , she was perhaps most closely linked to all three . <p> Mary Pratt had told him to expect a visit from his mother . She told him at the funeral . He was standing by the grave when he saw her first . It was raining , a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the collar of his shirt . The minister was speaking of eternal rest and dust and peace ; he spoke of a bloody sacrifice on a wooden cross , and of God 's love . Aeryk tried to understand it , but it was so hard . He was only five , after all . <p> His father 's hand gripped his shoulder so tightly that it hurt , but Aeryk did n't complain . His father had always been that way , as long as he could remember : a presence at his back , unseen , made real by pain . He was often gone until after dark , working at that blocky brown building Aeryk had been in only once , working with papers and pens , providing for the family . Aeryk could almost pretend his father did n't exist , except it was his father who did the spanking , whenever he or Bobby had been bad ( like the time that Aeryk had poured his grape juice in the bedroom wastebasket , or the time that Bobby had broken the crystal dove in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - three quick sharp blows , never more , and then stiff hands lifting him to his feet , and his father telling him not to cry , that men did n't cry . <p> But the pain now was almost comforting : it gave him something to focus on , something steady and solid and real . He concentrated on that pain while they lowered the damp black coffin into the pit . He concentrated on the pain when his imagination told him that Mommy was n't in the pit at all ; she was at home , waiting for them ; she was making spaghetti , because she knew that Aeryk liked to eat spaghetti on cold , rainy days . <p> And then he saw Mary , who was spreading out a picnic , by a gravestone , in the rain . He saw her pour two glasses of milk , and put one on the picnic blanket , and drink the other in one long gulp . Then she laughed and said something to the gravestone , and she stroked it with her fingers in the way his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the thunk , thunk , thunk of piling dirt became less echoey , Aeryk slipped out of his father 's grip and left the grim wet gathering to ask this girl what she was doing . She looked up when he approached , and she offered him , silently , a scone . He saw that it was wet , and shook his head . <p> She told him her name and suggested that he sit , but Aeryk shook his head again . <p> " What are you doing ? " he asked . <p> She smiled . " I 'm having lunch with my Daddy . " <p> Aeryk looked at the gravestone . " Your Daddy 's dead , " he said . <p> She took a bite from the scone that she had offered him . " There were these two men , " she said around the mouthful . " One was Chinese , the other American . They went to a cemetery together , to visit their mothers ' graves . The American had a bunch of flowers , and the Chinese guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his mother 's grave , then went to see what the Chinese guy was doing . The Chinese guy was spreading out a big picnic on his mother 's grave . Do you really think your mother is going to come up and eat that ? ' said the American . The Chinese guy smiled and looked at the American . You know what he said ? She will eat this meal at the same time that your mother rises from the dead to sniff your flowers . ' " Mary took another bite from the scone . She chewed for a moment , staring at the gravestone . " My Daddy never did like flowers . " <p> Aeryk shook his head . " You 're weird . " <p> Mary looked at him . " That your mother they 're burying ? " she asked . <p> Aeryk nodded . <p> " Do n't worry , " she said . " She 'll come back and talk to you . My Daddy did . " <p> " Do n't be stupid . " <p> " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go to heaven when they die . Heaven 's too far away . They go to Faerie , which is closer , so that they can keep an eye on you . There are doorways between here and Faerie , so sometimes they can even come and visit . Then , when you 're grown up , they go to heaven . " <p> " Who told you that ? " <p> " My Daddy did , before he died , so I know it 's true . " <p> But Aeryk felt a lump in his throat , and a hot pulse behind his eyes , and he remembered his Mommy lying in the hospital bed with the broken mouth and the gauze and the big dark bruises around her eyes , and he remembered her pale hand - how he had squeezed it and squeezed it , willing her to squeeze him back . She had n't been able to speak to him . She had n't been able to say a word . " You are stupid , " he said , and he turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine , sitting in the back with his father and his little brother Bobby , who was four . Bobby kept on opening and closing the ashtray in the door . His father stared straight ahead , his face expressionless except for a twitching in the eyes . The car smelled of leather . Outside , the cold gray world slipped by . <p> Aeryk listened to the click , click , click , of the ashtray being opened and closed , and suddenly he wanted to scream , to scream and scream . He wanted to smash his little brother 's fingers in the ashtray and punch his father 's face to make his eyes stop twitching . He wanted to rage and kick . He wanted thunder and wind and hail , not the anemic drizzle of the rain . <p> He clenched his fingers into fists and clamped his jaw , and held his breath against the burning sting of tears . <p> And then came the voice , as Mary Pratt had said it would . " Be still , little Aeryk . Be still . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sitting where his father had been . She wore the red silk dress that they had buried her in . Her cheeks were rosy from the mortician 's make-up , but her throat was a near-translucent blue . Aeryk blinked and stared into his mother 's pale eyes . <p> " Mommy , " he said . <p> " Oh , Aeryk . I miss you so . " And a pale hand reached out and closed around his fingers , and it was icy cold and far too tight . " There is something I must tell you , " she said . " It is important that you listen very closely . Okay ? " <p> Aeryk nodded mutely . <p> " Good boy . You are a good boy , Aeryk . " She closed her eyes for a moment , then opened them and looked into his face . " The world is a crazy place , Aeryk . It is n't safe . As much as I want it to be safe for you , as hard as I tried to make it safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , the chill of her grip around his fingers started seeping up his arm . It ached in his elbow , his bicep . Creeping tendrils of cold stretched to his shoulder and then moved inward , reaching for his heart . " The man who made me die , " she said , " the one who beat me and left me naked in my kitchen in a pool of my blood .... " She stopped and her eyes slipped shut . When they opened again there was a fierceness in them , a terrible fire . " He is closer than you think , Aeryk . He is closer than you think . " <p> Aeryk felt the ice grip his chest , and he wondered if his heart would stop . He fought to keep on breathing . " Are you in Faerie ? " he whispered . <p> A tiny smile touched his mother 's mouth , but the fierceness did not leave her eyes . " Faerie ? You can call it Faerie if you like . " <p> " Then I can go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you and I 'll be safe . " <p> " Oh , Aeryk , " she said . <p> But then the pink and purple skin was peeling from his mother 's face like pale rust , and her eyes shriveled in her sockets , blackening . Aeryk threw up his arms and he screamed . He screamed and screamed until he felt his father shaking him , and then he wanted to throw himself into his father 's arms and press himself against his solid chest , but his father let go and turned away , and stared ahead with no expression on his face but twitching eyes . <p> AERYK DID NOT SEE Mary Pratt again for eleven years . He spent those years in search of Faerie . At first Aeryk thought the entrance would be a place , and in the evenings while Bobby and his father stared at the TV ( Bobby drinking root beer , his father drinking Michelob ) , Aeryk searched the large old house in which they lived , and the woods around . He searched in every cabinet and closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narnia . He stalked through the basement , certain he was overlooking some hidden room , or a secret hollow which concealed an eldritch key . And then he 'd wander through the woods behind the house , or climb a tree and sit in silent waiting , listening for the sounds of forest folk - the wood sprites and the dryads . <p> As he grew older , although he did not stop believing in a world of Faerie , his understanding of it became less literal , and he began to look for Faerie in the smell of spring flowers and the raging summer storms that sometimes crashed along the coast . He knew that there was something more than just this world of flesh and grief , something that was hinted at in the visions of the lunatic and in the thrill of music . He began to play the violin ; and when he played , when the smell of rosin hit him like a drug and the resonations buzzed through his fingers and his jaw , when he played La Folia by Corelli and his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world were there , palpable , just out of reach . He could almost see its wild hillsides and its dreamy yellow skies . And so he played , he played and he composed his own ragged melodies which  --  while often awkward and unrefined- swelled with his passion for the Faerie world , and sometimes came so close to bringing it alive that for a moment he believed that he would really cross the gap . While he played he often thought about his mother , and sometimes his harsh dissonances in the lower registers were tonal paintings of her half-dead body on the kitchen floor . And often when he played there was another face he saw : the face of Mary Pratt , six years old and eating scones while sitting on her father 's grave . <p> In all those years his father beat him only once , but it was enough . It happened when he was ten years old , when he still half-believed a doorway into Faerie lay hidden somewhere in the house . He was pretending that the entrance lay behind the display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move it out from the wall far enough , he could slip behind it and into another world . <p> But his efforts ended in disaster . The case came crashing down , and all the ornaments-the porcelain figurines his mother used to collect , and those blue Christmas plates from Sweden displayed along the upper shelf - were scattered and shattered in a moment of wild sound . Aeryk stood in silence , staring at the ruin , until his father came . <p> His father had been drinking . He always drank now , mostly beer . After Mommy 's death his father had started coming home from work sooner , but he 'd been no more present : he 'd sit and drink and watch TV , and when the news came on he 'd go to bed . Aeryk and Bobby moved quietly when their father was home , as if somehow they knew what lurked behind his eyes , waiting for a sound to set it free . <p> The first thing to hit him was his father 's scream ; then came the blows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gut . Aeryk curled into a ball on the floor while his father kicked him , and for a moment he was sure that he would die . He looked up at his raging father , and as he looked into his father 's face there was a change : a widening of the eyes , an opening of the mouth , a look of fear creeping in and driving out the rage . And his father looked around the room , the very room where his mother had been killed-and Aeryk saw the way his father began to shake , the way the selfloathing settled in . Aeryk closed his eyes and felt his own cold fear . His father stumbled from the kitchen . After a time Aeryk rose to his feet and limped into the living room . His father was curled up on the sofa , clutching a pillow to his chest . Bobby stood at the edge of the stairs . Aeryk crossed the room and sat down on the edge of the sofa . He put a hand on his father 's shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played the violin for hours every day , while his father closed inward on himself and shut out his children even more . The music became Aeryk 's comforter . <p> He met Mary Pratt again along the Newport cliff walk , in the summer when he was sixteen . She was standing on the rocks with her back to the sea , looking at the great stone house which rose above the stretching grass like some European palace , whispering the mysteries of wealth . She was balanced on her toes , her body arched , her dark hair streaming in the wind . Her face was a mask of rapture . <p> He did not recognize her , but when he saw her he knew that in all his years of searching , the thing he had been looking for was her . She did not seem to notice his approach , but when he stood before her , she turned her eyes to him and smiled lazily , as if coming awake . " Hello , " she said . " I dreamed about you last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lovers ? " The word sounded strange to Aeryk . His friends in school had girlfriends , or boyfriends . They did not have lovers . <p> She jumped down off the rock and faced him . " Do you remember me ? " she asked . <p> He shook his head . <p> " I remember you , " she said . " Maybe it 's your baby face . You have n't changed so much since you were little . " <p> And then suddenly he knew . " Mary , " he said . " Mary something . The one at the funeral . " <p> Her smile was radiant , and she took his hand and led him along the cliff . " Where are we going ? " he asked . <p> " To look for Faerie . " <p> He followed where she led . He followed as she showed him all the secret places , the quiet comers of the world where magic lurked so near that he could taste it on his tongue . She took him to the cliff in Jamestown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foolish manhood rituals , leaping from the edge with their sneakers on to plunge into the still dark waters far below . And Aeryk , who had never had the urge to join the other boys in such displays of bravado , learned what it was like to jump and fall and hit the water : the sudden thrill as rushing air was turned to icy froth ; the adrenal pulsing in his face and throat ; the drag of his shoes as they soaked up water like heavy sponges ; the momentary confusion , not knowing which way led to air and life . And in the instant before breaking the surface : the silence , the fragmented light , the sense of utter peace and stillness . Aeryk knew he was on the brink of Faerie . <p> She took him to the coast at midnight and showed him how to hunt for crabs . And as the moon reflected in the rock-trapped pools she ran her fingers through his hair . In the shadow of the old lighthouse , as dawn splashed orange highlights on the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts . <p> They were together every day throughout that summer . Two weeks after he met her she shaved her hair over one ear , leaving behind a velvet fuzz , and she showed up at his door with lips painted black and a spider pendant hanging in the hollow of her throat . " I thought that I 'd become a witch , " she said . <p> " You look more like an angel to me . " <p> Mary laughed . " Aeryk , Aeryk , Aeryk . You 're always so corny . " <p> He played his violin for her , while she lay at his feet with her eyes closed . He played his own compositions , and somehow in the midst of it , she began to sing , wordlessly - and her voice was pure and high and haunting , and it wove through the resonating violin like a thread of light : a perfect contrapuntal harmony that refined and purified his own roughedged compositions . The sound of her voice made him ache , and almost cry . Soon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the heart of it , steady at the heart of sound , they both could feel the gateway 's presence . <p> Afterward they would have made love , had it not seemed so redundant . Instead they lay together on the floor , holding hands ; and she told him they would be together forever , linked by music and madness and love . <p> A week later they found a stack of wooden planks in the garage . The wood had been there for years , but Aeryk had never paid attention to it . It was Mary who suggested that they build a tree house out behind the house . They built it in a week , working several hours every day . Mary found some old roofing tiles and some carpet remnants . They scattered old pillows in the corners and put movie posters on the walls . When they were finished it was clean and intimate . " Our love nest , " Mary said , and Aeryk laughed . Then they did make love , amidst the pillows , while robins watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father at all that summer , but Aeryk was used to that . His father had stopped drinking after the incident in the kitchen , and he 'd thrown himself into his work again : getting up before dawn , working at the office until nine at night , or sometimes ten . Bobby was out with his gang of friends all day , smoking or skateboarding or cruising the mall . The large old house was mostly left to Aeryk and to Mary . When others were at home , they had their love nest ( their gateway ) in the woods . <p> He never met her family . She said her mother was a drunk , and that they lived in a trailer park : an ugly , dirty place where men wore Wrangler jeans and the women still used light blue eyeshadow , somehow thinking that was beautiful . One month after they met , Mary stopped going home at night , and stayed with Aeryk in his room . He never introduced her to his family . There was no point . His father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word . <p> FAERIE CAME TO THEM at last , wild and real , with the storm . The hurricane took shape in the Atlantic ocean and swept toward land in the familiar way , threatening the Carolina coast . But then it started moving north , and it became clear that a piece of it might brush New England . Some of the locals made plans to drive inland for a few days , others shuttered up their houses and prepared to brave the storm . Aeryk 's father left a note that he was leaving town , and that his sons should do the same . Bobby laughed when he saw the note , then told Aeryk not to expect to see him for a while , and he left the house . <p> Aeryk and Mary were left alone , and as they sat in the house watching the news reports and looking out the window at the deceptive sunny calm , they knew what was coming . At last it was coming , raging and seething : the doorway into Faerie . And they would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their love . <p> It was a magic fantasy of youth , a reckless dream : amidst the thunder and the wind they would make love , their bodies slicked and pounded by the rain . <p> The anticipation was almost more than they could bear . <p> They spent the evening before the storm reading to each other in Aeryk 's room : fairy tales and passages from The Lord of the Rings . Later , when the storm arrived , they would go outside . Mary was downstairs in the kitchen , fixing herself some food , when the first plump raindrops splatted against the window . It was then that Aeryk 's father came home . Aeryk was reading in his bed when he heard his father 's car , and a strange flutter went through him . He sat up in bed , and he wondered if he should go downstairs . He heard the door open , and the rumble of his father 's voice . Aeryk closed his book and set it aside , wondering why his heart was beating in his throat . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a crash as something shattered on the floor . <p> Aeryk ran out of his room and down the stairs , seeing his father 's form vanish toward the back of the house , where the master bedroom lay . Mary was standing in the kitchen doorway . A plate of sandwiches lay broken at her feet . Her eyes glistened . <p> " What happened ? " Aeryk gasped . <p> Mary 's mouth worked silently . Her hand went to her throat . <p> Aeryk crossed the gap between them and tried to put his arms around her but she jerked back . " What happened ? " he asked again . <p> Mary swallowed and looked down . She shook her head as if to clear it . " He called me your slut , " she said . " ' There she is , ' he said . ' Aeryk 's little slut . ' And then he ... " She looked down at the broken plate . " Oh , God . I made a mess . " <p> " And then he what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . <p> Mary poked at a sandwich with her foot . <p> " And then what ? " Aeryk resisted the urge to shake her . <p> Mary shrugged . " He said that maybe he should kill me , too . " The wind was picking up outside . The rain was drumming against the windows . The hurricane 's full fury was still some time away . <p> Aeryk wanted to scream . He wanted to scream as badly as he had wanted to scream so many years ago , in the limousine , driving from his mother 's funeral . He wanted to rage and kick and thrash . And he recalled the vision of his dead mother , sitting next to him and warning him : He is closer than you think . He remembered his father 's twitching eyes . <p> He was bursting into his father 's room before he knew that he 'd left Mary 's side . His father was sitting on the bed . Aeryk struck him where he sat , struck him across the face with his fist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leapt onto the bed , straddling his father 's prone body , and grabbed him by the hair . Aeryk wanted to choke him , to strangle him , to make him pay for all the years of emptiness and coldness , to make him pay for the time that he was beaten , to make him pay for his mother 's death . His father stared up at him in silence . Aeryk smelled the beer , as if his father had been bathing in it . He clenched his free hand into a fist and tightened his grip on his father 's hair . " Why did you come back here ? " he demanded . <p> His father opened his mouth , closed it . His eyes seemed glazed . " You better watch out for that slut of yours , " he said . " One day you might walk into a room and find her naked underneath some other man . You never know when it will happen . " <p> Aeryk let go of his father 's hair . " Fuck you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aeryk , " she said . " Come on , Aeryk . " <p> But there was a wetness in his father 's eyes . " I do n't know who he was , " his father said . His head lolled off to one side . " They did n't expect me home . They were on the kitchen floor , like they could n't wait to get into the bedroom . She was never that eager with me . " Now that he spoke the words at last they came on top of each other in an urgent stream . " I killed him first . He was n't very big , so he was easy to kill . Your mother fought harder . " <p> " Oh , my God , " breathed Mary . <p> Aeryk stared at his father 's face , at the slackness of his father 's mouth . <p> " It was his semen they found inside her . " He closed his eyes . " That 's why they never suspected me . The DNA did n't match . I broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the man 's body . Then I called the police . " <p> " Oh , my God . Oh my God . " <p> Aeryk stared in silence at his father . He heard the crack of his own jaw . He had known . In a way he had known all his life . The wind was starting to whistle through the windows . " Why did you come back here ? " he said at last . <p> His father let out a laugh . " For a minute there , " he said , " I was hoping you would do it for me . " <p> Aeryk rose . He stood over the bed , looking down on his father . He saw what he had n't seen before , stuffed under his father 's belt , like a tumor . " You should have done it long ago . " It was not what he had meant to say . <p> " Aeryk , " Mary whispered . She came up behind him and put a hand between his shoulder blades . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped around him . Her breasts pressed up against his back . The wind was starting to howl . <p> " Do n't do it , Daddy , " he said . <p> His father sat up slowly in bed . He took the gun out of his belt , looked at it , then tossed it away from him . It clattered on the floor . " I 've always been too much a coward . " <p> Aeryk turned away and left the room . Mary trailed after . He sat down on the edge of the sofa and stared at the floor , hearing the rising storm . <p> Mary sat down next to him . She put her arm around him and leaned her head on his shoulder . " Oh , Aeryk , " she said . <p> " The storm , " he whispered . " Faerie . " He turned to look at her . " Is my mother still in Faerie ? " he asked . " Or am I too old now ? Time for her to move on into heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary whispered . " Your Mommy and my Daddy , both of them . Looking out for us . " <p> Aeryk looked toward the window . The rain was beating on the glass and the wind was howling and swirling , searching for a way inside . " Do you hear it ? " he said . " It 's a symphony . You hear the tremolo in the cellos ? The pounding of the timpani ? " He lifted up a finger . " There . Triplets in the brass . " <p> " And the violin , " Mary said . " Weaving through it all , like that solo from Rimsky-Korsakov 's Scheherazade . You ca n't forget the violin . " <p> The gun fired . They heard the dull thump of the body on the floor . The storm raged on , indifferent . <p> Mary rose slowly to her feet . The tears overflowed her eyes . She held out her hands to him . <p> Aeryk felt her fingers around his own , warm and soft and precious . He let her lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She led him toward the door . As always , he followed her . <p> The wind was wild . The rain came down as if the fundament of some heavenly ocean had cracked , and the seas were pouring down . They ran hand-in-hand through the storm , ducking falling branches , squinting and blinking as the water washed their eyes . They stopped at the base of the tree house and stripped off their clothes . They kissed each other in the raging wind , and even with the rain they could taste the salt of tears . Even with the rain , their naked skins were hot against each other . When their urgency became a pulsing fire in their faces - when grief and loss were mingled with the wild thrill - they climbed into the tree house , and there made love . The rain poured through the open windows and splashed against their joining flesh , and their moans were lost amidst the howling of the wind . <p> The storm still raged when they were through . They lay side by side on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the storm 's wild power , and let it beat down over them , cleansing them , washing everything away , everything but the swell of their desire . Mary mouthed the words : " I love you . " Her skin was flushed and beautiful . Aeryk took her face in his hands , and felt his love for her like a madness . He moved to kiss her on the mouth , and saw her sparkling eyes , and was just about to meet her parted lips when it all went white , blazing white , and-with a wild crashing noise-they crossed at last the threshold . The sky beyond was pale blue with hints of yellow at the edges . It was quiet - the loudest thing seemed to be the sun . In the distance , perhaps , children played . <p> The picnic blanket was laid out carefully on the grass . The trees had leaves of greenish silver that gave a rustle like foil and then were still again . Milk and scones were set out , along with salad and raspberries and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble monument of dancing lovers ( their ears pointed , their eyes slanted , the little nubs of horns upon their foreheads ) . Aeryk felt Mary 's warmth beside him , and he turned to look at her . She was radiant and soft , and the redness of her cheeks was the redness of life . She looked at him , smiling . " They come , " she said . <p> Aeryk turned . His mother approached , wearing gauzy white and feathers in her hair . There was a man with her he did not recognize , but he knew it must be Mary 's father . He had Mary 's eyes . <p> They sat down on the blanket . He met his mother 's eyes . She did not speak , but she reached out and he took her hand and held it for a moment . There was sadness in her eyes . <p> They ate in silence . They ate until all the food was gone . Then his mother took his hand again , and at last she spoke . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For us . " He glanced at Mary , but her eyes were on her father , who was smiling and reaching for her , cupping her cheek in his hand . She said something but he could not hear the words , as if a veil of privacy enveloped them . <p> Aeryk turned back to his mother . She was so beautiful , he 'd forgotten how beautiful she was . " What about Daddy ? " he asked . <p> She patted his hand and looked away . " He was always such a lonely man . " <p> Aeryk heard distant laughter , the laughter of children . He heard the squawking efforts of a novice violinist . He looked around at the still blue sky . The sounds were coming from all around , drifing in and out . He heard the sobs of a child 's temper tantrum , the wail of a hungry infant . A high voice sang The Itsy Bitsy Spider . The sounds came and went , distant , ephemeral : the children of the world . <p> " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have all listened to you here . " She smiled and patted his hand again . " Music , " she said , " and madness , and love . Take these things with you , hold them close to you . In the hardest times , they will carry you . " <p> The rescue workers found the lovers curled together , unconscious , amidst the shattered remnants of the tree house . An EMT commented that it was a miracle they lived . " Someone must have been looking out for those two , " he said . They found the father in the house , dead by his own hand , the mouth beneath his ruined head shaped in an oh of surprise . There was also another body found in the woods outside the house , many years old and mostly decayed . It had been exposed by the beating rains . <p> The lovers were taken to the hospital , and cared for there . The nurses commented on how peaceful they seemed , as if they 'd both seen angels .
