Before this is over , we 're all going to lose our shirts . You . Me . The cabbie talking about his mutual funds . The guy behind the deli counter reading Barron 's . My " fully invested " barber . The suits on Wall Street . They can afford it . But oh , yes , they 'll pay too . We 're all floating on the same bubble . <P> There 's no telling when , of course . We might see Dow 8000 , 9000 and 10,000 before the next sharp market decline  --  the dreaded bear market . Incredibly , the current blistering pace would roll the Dow past those milestones by year 's end . How far is up ? That question is relevant only to those able to spot the market 's top and get out before the herd  --  which is to say it is relevant to no one because while some may get lucky , no such expert exists . <P> So when the market finally blows , you can be sure it 'll take the clothes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads is to lighten up on stocks now and sell a little more every time the Dow notches a few hundred points higher . That 's heresy in today 's stock-crazed world . It could mean missing the better part of a huge rally still to come . So no one is going to do it . Heck , we 're still throwing $20 billion a month into stock mutual funds . The inflows have n't even slowed , much less stopped , much less reversed . But the only other choice is to be led to the slaughter . And we are being led . <P> The people who shepherd our money  --  analysts , brokers , money managers  --  rarely say it 's time to get out of stocks . That 's not how they put caviar on the table . Their job is to set a target and , after it 's reached , set it higher . For them it pays to snort like a bull even when they feel like a bear . Take Barton Biggs , the well-regarded global strategist for Morgan Stanley . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , euphoria is epidemic and the bull market cycle has got to be long in the tooth . " Yet he says buy more stocks . <P> Abby Cohen , the closely watched market guru at Goldman Sachs , has become mildly unnerved by the Dow 's 10% rise in recent weeks  --  a gain she had expected would take all year . But she 's raising her target anyway . Ralph Acampora , a veteran at Prudential Securities , two years ago predicted the move to 7000 . Now that it 's happened , his new target is 8250 . And once we get there ? On to 10,000 , natch . Meanwhile , pundits who do make a bear stand do n't last . Elaine Garzarelli , known for her 1987 warning , issued another late last summer but has already recanted . You can be sure that when this bull market finally ends there wo n't be anyone sounding an alarm . If you expect a savior , you 're doomed . <P> If you have time , the way to beat the system is to forget what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge to sell when prices eventually tumble . With baby boomers saving for retirement , odds are stocks will go much higher over the next 20 years . It 's silly to jump in and out and risk missing big rallies . The declines will be overcome . But human nature has n't changed much since Adam and Eve . Many people now putting their life savings in stocks will instinctively move to protect them if they sense lasting trouble . Rather than lock in lush profits today , they 'll lock in dismal gains  --  if not outright losses  --  tomorrow . <P> Daniel Kadlec is TIME 's Wall Street columnist .
