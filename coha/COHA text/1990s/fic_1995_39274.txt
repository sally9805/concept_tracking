She was choosing cucumbers at the grocery store and wondering what sorts of genitalia cicadas had when someone touched her on the shoulder . She prepared her public face and turned , expecting to see her friend the produce man . There was no one behind her . The automatic sprinkler over the vegetables switched on and soaked the sleeve of her new suede jacket . She wanted someone to be behind her . She turned all the way round and there , at the far end of her cart in a wet mist which rose faintly pink from a heap of red cabbages , stood Henry V of England . <p> " He 's awfully young , " she said aloud , or nearly aloud . There was no one else around . She hastily chose a cucumber and a red cabbage , though her sons hated red cabbage , wheeled her cart in a half-circle and went fast away from the boy-king past the oranges and the garlic , to the checkout counter . He strode behind her . She did not look back , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . He helped her unload her groceries for the cashier , who asked her if she was in a hurry . Maureen did n't answer . Henry V followed her out the door to the parking lot , carrying both bags of groceries . She told the bag boy she did n't need his help . The king walked to the rear of her car and waited , grinning , while she fetched the keys to open the trunk . After setting the bags inside he tossed his mop of blond hair , which was cut as if with a bowl and stood out like eaves over his longish ears and away from his forehead , with a twist of his neck . Then he stood straight and grinned some more . He made Maureen think of a golden retriever puppy her parents had bought her as a child , which had dug under the fence and disappeared after two weeks . <p> " Where did this guy come from ? " she asked herself . The after-work rush was beginning . Several people passed by her car without staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping done that they do n't notice a boy wearing studded gloves , a tooled scabbard and a tunic emblazoned with the Lancaster lions straddling two parking places behind a Honda Accord ? Henry V , for his part , did n't seem to notice any of the hurrying shoppers or the line of cars building up behind Maureen 's , waiting for her to vacate her parking place . He only had eyes for Maureen . " I must have made him up , " she decided . " This is very sick . This is terrible . " <p> She decided to kill him quickly . After all , he 'd been dead already for hundreds of years . Who would arrest her ? She jerked open the car door . It stuck a bit because of the dent from a couple of weeks ago . She scrambled into the driver 's seat and it hit her that she did n't have the keys . He had opened the trunk and held onto the keys . How could she run over him when he had her car keys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . He tapped on the glass , still grinning . He was so close she could see that his teeth were very bad : brown nubs , medieval teeth , disgusting . She rolled down the window to accept the keys he dangled between their faces , and she smelled wood smoke and manure . When she had taken the keys and started the car he walked back behind it again and stood waiting for her to mow him down , grinning into the rearview mirror . Her fingers tapped the emergency brake but did n't release it . She had always suspected that her puppy had been run over by a car and that her parents had never told her . One of the cats behind her ground its gears irritably and screeched away , and the next car in line honked loudly . She closed her eyes and let her head sink back against the headrest . Henry V bounded along the side of the car and appeared in the seat next to her . " I definitely dreamed him up . But I had no idea he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to herself , and to him : " Fasten your seat belt . I 'm a conservative person . " He obeyed immediately . <p> She had a good deal of trouble getting used to him . That first night and several afterward he spent in the garage . When she got into the car to drive to work the next day he was in his seat waiting for her , his seat belt snugly buckled . He stayed in the car while she answered phones at the radio station where she worked . He followed her into the house that afternoon and sat at the kitchen table while she fixed supper . Once or twice he rose to look out the window , but mostly he stared at her . She stared back . She asked herself questions : how long would he stay , could he speak ? When one of her sons came thundering up the basement stairs to report that someone had spilt something black and oily on the beige carpet downstairs , she jumped so high she broke a plate . She gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to the pantry for baking soda . She gave it to him and told him to pour it on the carpet and to leave her alone , she was busy . She realized as he thundered back down that she had given him the wrong stuff ; she turned dizzily to call him back and ran into Henry V who had followed her into the pantry . She tripped on his armor-toed boot , and he caught her by the hand to stop her falling . She thought once more of the golden retriever pup , who had been always underfoot , whose nose had been soft and damp like Henry 's glove , and who had slept in the garage . <p> She pulled her hand away from his and raised it to him as a warning , against what she was n't sure . She felt it was time for her to say something . Her thoughts were disorganized . She had never been good at initiating conversation . She did n't even know if he would understand her sort of English . But she began anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I seem to have a transition to make here , and I 'm afraid it 's too much . You know I remember when my sons were babies both of them were fussy babies . It 's funny , I do n't know anymore which one did what cute thing or bad thing , which one 's first word was mine and which one 's mama . They run together . My sister-in-law was always giving me scrapbooks with those plastic quilted covers , you know the ones  --  no , of course you do n't  --  and telling me I 'd be sorry if I did n't write things down , my babies would be gone forever . Well anyway , they were both fussy , that I remember , and I 'm not too sorry that 's gone forever either , it was n't colic or anything , they were just always fussing . And the pediatrician asked me if they cried when I picked them up or when I put them down or when I changed their diapers or when I started feeding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yes , yes , yes , all of those , ' and she wrote DIT in her file . That 's for ' Difficulty in Transition . ' That 's what I 'm having . Can you talk ? " Henry V stared at her , his gloved hand still outstretched where it had held hers . " Please sit down again , " she said . <p> She sat down with him at the kitchen table and looked him over carefully . Ht had a couple of days ' growth of beard ( a soft , flimsy teenage beard like the whiskers her sons were beginning to sprout ) with a pink Celtic skin underneath , a deep round scar on his lower left cheek  --  smallpox , an arrow ? But his face was essentially undear to her ; even when she gazed at it point-blank it seemed curiously as if she were looking through welling tears . The setting sun blazed in through the window behind his head and cast him still further into shadow . <p> She sighed . " So maybe the deal is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do with you , if I want to do anything . If I do anything , the first thing I 'll do is send you to the dentist . " <p> She balled her hands into fists and closed her eyes . She willed Henry V 's teeth capped , opened her eyes and took a breath . He was gone . She did n't know whether to be relieved or disappointed . There was no trace of him left . His pungent smell had disappeared . The glove he had removed in order to scratch himself was no longer on the table . Then she heard a clatter behind her , by the sink . She turned and saw him rummaging in the dish drainer , then raising a colander toward the window into a shaft of sunlight . The light gently freckled his face through the holes in the colander . She breathed again . <p> " Grin at me , " she said . He did . His teeth were beautiful . They glinted in the sun shaft like a movie star 's . She blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want him to be a movie star . The teeth were now perfect ; nevertheless , she could not avoid thinking that she might as well have a lemur hunkering at her sink , so primitive a primate was this man , so attenuated was their connection on the evolutionary time line . He gave her the shivers . <p> He , on the other hand , appeared to be comfortably settled in her kitchen . Having found a knife in the dish drainer , with one foot propped on the table , he was scraping mud from his boot , his mouth folded inward in concentration . But how could she manage to squeeze herself into his unfathomable life ? Did Maureen come before Queen Katharine or after ? Was Falstaff dead ? Had the boy-king known sorrow ? Boredom ? Impotence ? How could she fit him into her life ? <p> This would be more difficult than the teeth . She dragged a broom over and began sweeping clods of dirt from under the table : he had finished cleaning his boots . He picked something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her sons ' pet white mice  --  squashed it on his thumbnail , turned his face up to her and obligingly showed his new teeth . She was proud of her dentistry , and hoped it had n't caused him any pain . So this was how she would proceed : she would ignore Falstaff and Katharine and make him fit her , if she had the power . <p> She got to work right after supper that night . She dug out both Henry IVs and Henry V , and the encyclopedia She looked him up in the indexes of her college Western Civilization textbooks . There was not much to be found out that she did n't know already : two paragraphs in each text and one in the encyclopedia . The Henry IVs she ended by skimming : she did not enjoy seeing this boy as a jackanapes . It was n't constructive . She decided to go to the video store the next day and rent Olivier 's Henry V , though only in the spirit of scholarly thoroughness . She knew already Olivier would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be delicate . In all her imaginings she still could n't imagine why it was such a man she had come up with . " God knows there have been plenty of things I wanted to change about nearly every man I 've known , " she confided to Henry as he helped her empty the dishwasher . " And I could n't fix them either . " <p> Getting ready for bed that night she wondered if it would work to make him the actor from the new Henry I movie she had seen recently . She did n't think so , but she decided to give it some consideration . At least the actor , whose name she could n't remember , could be dressed in a shirt and jeans . Maureen was put off by those studded gloves . So she ran down the stairs with her toothbrush in her mouth , passing her husband on his way up ( Kirk did n't seem to see her ) , swallowing toothpaste . She rummaged through old newspapers until she found an ad for the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore little resemblance to her Henry V ; the blurry newsprint picture was as inscrutable as her Henry 's fuzzy face . A fantasy life with an actor would n't work anyway , she said to herself as she refolded the paper and stacked it on the recycling pile . Most of them are gay , she had surmised from meeting them when they came to read at the radio station where she worked , also self-centered . And if he were n't gay , who could tell when she might pick up People magazine and find pictures of this guy with his gorgeous wife and his cottage in the country and his two unctuous Siamese cats . No , the idea of an actor was too unruly . Though as a medieval warlord he might prove stubborn , Henry , being dead , could at least be pinned down . <p> Then there was the question of age . His youth was embarrassing to Maureen . But he had died young  --  it had happened  --  and here he was now , with her . The encyclopedia did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't worry about that for now , nor his studded gloves , nor even his age . She spent a sleepless night and a long day at her office phone , in her car and on her kitchen stool fooling with Henry 's clothes , his adolescent grin , his wispy budding beard ; and she could n't do anything about them . Apparently she had to live with him a while before she was sure what she wanted and how much she could do . At least she 'd taken care of those teeth . Fuzzy as he looked , he had a hard center and she would have to leave that alone for now . And , need she worry about his age ? Why should she be embarrassed ? Who would see them and laugh ? And after all , princes matured early , did n't they ? They had to . This boy had whored with Falstaff , fathered a king , decimated the French army . She spent days trying to figure things out . She kept tripping over Henry in the kitchen and locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one day she said to the whistling kettle , where she was boiling water for tea . She had switched from coffee to tea because it was British . She told Kirk she had n't been sleeping well and was cutting down on caffeine ; when she offered him some tea he made a nauseated face . " Fuck it and od 's bodkins . It 's my fantasy , is n't it ? I 'll imagine that nothing matters . Maybe I 'll change a few things gradually , and then I wo n't have so much trouble with transitions . Meanwhile this is the king I 'm stuck with . " <p> She decided to work on her seduction . She sat on her stool at the kitchen counter with a pot of steamed beets in front of her needing to be peeled and sliced and closed her eyes to begin an outline . She wondered about his underwear . Did he wear any ? She thought not , dispatching hastily from behind her closed eyes a picture of him in a chain mail jock strap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be none . They could come later . Leave the wordy wooing to Shakespeare . <p> First she tried squeezing herself into the nightdress of the newlywed Queen Katharine . Demure and virginal she could muster , but no , in her fantasy she did n't want to be anyone 's wife  --  not even the wife of a boy barbarian . She would have to be Maureen , keeping Kirk , stretch marks , and all . <p> She got down to details . She tried out a soap-opera type kiss  --  necks twisting , mouths wide open . It was n't right for his big canine head , too modern ; she felt sodden from it . She tried a continental kiss on the hand . That was wrong too , not Gaelic enough . She kept her eyes closed tightly through an interruption from her son Justin , who reported that indeed his white mice had gotten fleas . She snapped : " Do n't be ridiculous , mice do n't get fleas . And even if they did , where would they have gotten fleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ignored him and after a while he clomped clumsily back down the stairs . <p> Then she remembered a scene from the movie , and she knew she had her scenario . After the Battle of Agincourt , Henry and his men had carried their dead a long distance across the bloody battlefield , tripping over dead horses , to heap the bodies onto a cart , while singing a requiem . She sketched her scene briefly . She did n't want to prepare too much . She wanted it to happen . She thought at first she would keep her eyes closed , that it would be easier that way . But by the time he had moved across the kitchen and reached for her , she did n't know whether her eyes were open or closed . Her arms flailed and upset the beets . Red steamy juice spilled over the counter and trickled onto the floor . Henry heaved her over his shoulder so that her head and one arm dangled down his back and bounced as he walked . He carried her up the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : her hair was in her face . When they entered the bedroom he kicked the door closed and stooped to set her on her feet . She staggered . His cheeks were red , and he breathed heavily into her face . She smelled leeks and vinegar and sank stiffly backward onto the bed . <p> He towered over her like a hero , his feet planted widely apart . One of the lions on his tunic was almost completely obscured by gray dirt . The others heaved with his breathing . His eyelids fluttered , as if he were about to sink into a trance . Maureen thought for a moment he might faint or disappear , but instead he fumbled under his tunic with his left hand and drew his sword with his right ; she was pleased to see he had shed somewhere his studded gauntlets . Maureen clutched a handful of skin on her stomach  --  loose skin from pregnancies and wondered if he could kill her . <p> He brandished the sword three times over his head . She turned her face to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard the swish of the sword in the air . Then he cried , " Once more unto the breech " , threw the sword clanging against the wall and leapt on top of her . She gasped , felt him between her legs . He thrust at her once : " For England " he yelled painfully into her ear . Twice : " For Harry " Again : " And for St. George " <p> She felt him quiver and go limp . He must be densely built , more muscular than he looked , from jumping onto moving horses . He was absurdly heavy . Her lungs and belly were squashed . Her eyes felt like they would pop soon . She struggled for a breath . He was motionless . She managed to wriggle one of her arms out from under him . She pushed frantically at his shoulder  --  dead weight . Finally she got hold of the thick shock of hair at his forehead and jerked his head back from her chest . Something cracked in his neck , but she was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . His jaw fell open and he drooled a little . " Poor thing . I 'm not a horse , " she sighed . " We 're going back to the drawing board . " <p> So in the weeks that followed Maureen made subtle adjustments . She still wanted to be careful , not do too much ; for essentially she was satisfied . Orgasms were simply a matter of mechanics . For all his puppy-dog gracelessness , and despite the deceptive ease she had fixing his teeth , she came to appreciate this man 's royal recalcitrance . She had some power . He was hers . But she could not remove the dusty lions from his chest , nor , unless he took them off of his own accord , his spiky gloves . Clearly there was something important  --  a clumsy , importunate , entitled , colossal swagger  --  which she could not , would not , must not mar . She needed this about him . She needed as well his bumptious vigor , the susceptibility of his youth . She needed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intransigence left off and her needs began . <p> And sex was not the main thing here , after all . She knew Henry needed some modernizing . But , she feared that as the lover of a modern man she was n't married to , she would have to be " good in bed , " and she had almost no notion of what that meant . She knew from novels that some women dressed in bizarre outfits and did stripteases for men to excite them . Of course that was n't in bed , exactly . Anyway , if she could keep Henry in the Middle Ages , she would n't have to worry about being good in bed . She wanted a little more romance than he 'd supplied that first time ( she did n't want to be just a receptacle ) , but not too much awareness . She did n't want his expectations moving into the twentieth century . <p> First she circumcised him ( " This wo n't hurt much more than the teeth , " she promised him with a wavering smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then after a nasty outbreak of acne around his mouth made it difficult for her to look at him she firmly aged him a touch . He began to speak in a language she could never have spoken herself , but which she understood perfectly , effortlessly . His words were vague like music , like the sound an ocean makes , simple but arcane , archaic but neither Shakespearean nor Chaucerian , spiritual and earthy . He read poetry to her while she cooked . <p> They liked the same poems . He read Tennyson 's " Morte D'Arthur " over and over to her one night while she stirred a white sauce which refused to thicken . Each time Bedivere whipped Excalibur in the air , trying to let it go , she saw Henry and his sword and the orange daisies on her bedspread . She trembled , and her whisk sprinkled floury milk all over the stove ; when the mysterious arm rose from the water , " clothed in white samite , mystic , wonderful , " and caught the sword , she wept again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To His Coy Mistress . " While he read it , his beautiful metaphysical voice filled her up , and she stared at the red stain from the beet juice they had spilled that first time . She was hypnotized into an ethereal passion . From Marvell he flipped back a few pages in her anthology of the metaphysical poets and found the Donne poems her English teachers had skipped . She left a roast beef blackening in the oven the day he found this : <p> And yet no greater , but more eminent , Love by the spring is growne ; As , in the firmament , Starres by the Sunne are not inlarg 'd , but showne . Gentle love deeds , as blossomes on a bough , From loves awakened root do but out now . <p> She did not count the centuries by which Henry antedated Donne ( they had world enough and time ) . She was only astonished at how long she had yearned for some gentle love deeds . They understood each other perfectly , effortlessly . <p> She went from day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material world . Her friends asked if she had changed her makeup . Her husband wanted to know if she was having hot flashes . Her skin felt tight ; she was full as an egg . She saw beautiful people  --  beautiful men , rather  --  everywhere . At the coffee shop downstairs from the radio station she sat at the counter between two men so lovely she moved to a table so she could see them better . Henry was n't with her . The one on the left had a sumptuous beard and burly hands . The other had sad downslanting eyes and a wide mouth like Rudolf Nureyev 's . She forgot to drink her tea . She still did n't care much for tea anyway . She kept trying to drink it because Henry liked it . She felt sexy . She felt that , perhaps , if the beautiful men were to turn around , they might look at her too . She had a revelation . She had always assumed that sexy women attracted men . Now it occurred to her that it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have plenty of sex look sexy . And she was , after a fashion , experiencing such plenty . <p> She may even have become , without knowing it , " good in bed . " Very likely there was n't as much to it as she had used to think . And sure enough , she fancied , as she stood at the cash register paying her bill , that bearded man was staring at her . She was afraid to look up ; as she walked up the five flights of stairs back to the station ( she had decided to try to lose a few pounds ) , she was sure she did look different , having reacted to Henry 's lustful gaze like a plant to the sun . <p> She felt sexy even around her husband . She wore sweaters she 'd kept since before the boys were born ( they fit tightly now ) and lipstick . When Henry was not around , she sat beside Kirk on the couch during the TV news and let her shoulder graze his . She laid her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her mouth wet and open , then ( abandoning memory ) shoved her face behind his ear and breathed : " What could I do to turn you on ? " He neither moved no spoke . She drew back to look at his face . He was frankly considering . <p> " Leave me alone maybe , " he said at length , not unkindly . " You 're scaring me . " <p> After that , she left him alone , and he seemed to want to pick a fight with her . He complained that she was n't paying attention to anything . When she served him and the boys a supper of peas , broccoli , coleslaw and warm milk , Kirk gagged and beat his fists on the table . He went in his underwear to the dryer to get his sweatpants and reported angrily to Maureen that he had found the dryer running hot but empty . His sweatpants were still wet in the washer . They went to watch their sons play basketball at the high school one evening , and he squirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the beauty of the young boys ' bodies , and how she preferred basketball to football because the uniforms showed them off so much better . <p> " You do n't make sense anymore . The lights are on but nobody 's home , " Kirk said to her in the car on the way home . <p> She smiled and languidly apologized . <p> " The elevator does n't go to the top floor . " <p> She was driving . She had come recently to the conclusion that she liked to drive . Henry found the certainty with which she moved the stick shift arousing . <p> " You do n't have all the little dots on your dice . Where did you get that watch ? " <p> " What watch ? " <p> " What watch ? " he yelled back at her . " This watch . " He snatched her right arm from the steering wheel and waved it in the air between them . Maureen 's hand flopped loosely from the wrist . " This expensive-looking watch here with all the shiny jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using one arm . He held onto the other one . " I bought it for myself . I 've always wanted a nice watch . " She glanced at him . His nose was moving up and down as if it itched , but he did n't scratch it . He let her arm go so she could downshift to enter the driveway . " You can check the VISA bill , " she added . <p> She called the boy-king Hal now . He still wore his gloves and his high leather boots with the steel-armored toes , but the noisy sword and scabbard had disappeared , his tunic was cleaner , and his face was changing . It occurred to Maureen that the scantly shrinking ears and lengthening jaw were suggestive of a boy she had had a crush on in high school , but she could n't remember what that boy had looked like . She was n't too sure what anyone looked like anymore , except Henry , and even he could be capriciously unstable and , at times , still fuzzy around the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening while Maureen and Iris Millikin stuffed invitations for the PTA auction into envelopes . Cicadas had begun that week to appear . One had chased Maureen to the car that morning , flying upside down . Iris and she worked in the dining room . Maureen could n't see Hal , but she could feel him there in the next room , breathing , listening to her talk about her job and her cat and her teenagers , waiting for her . Iris asked about the new watch . <p> " I had n't realized it was so conspicuous , " said Maureen . " Several people have asked me about it . " <p> " My God , Maureen , it 's the flashiest watch I 've ever seen . It 's dripping with stones . Are they real ? " <p> Maureen nodded , blushing . " My lover gave it to me . " Iris looked slowly up from the invitation she was folding . Maureen giggled . She had n't told anyone else . She did n't know Iris well enough for large confidences , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; his steel toe clanged against a chair . Maureen hoped she had n't disturbed him by telling . <p> Iris gaped . Maureen continued talking , deciding as she talked that talking was good : a verification . <p> " It 's the best thing that 's ever happened to me . We understand each other perfectly , effortlessly . We read poetry together . He talks to me while I cook . When he reads Tennyson the room shakes , he has such a voice . And I read aloud too , and when I 'm with him my voice is n't a bit nasal . " <p> " Shhhh " urged Iris , tipping her head toward the living room . " Kirk is right in there . " <p> " The TV is too loud . He ca n't hear anything . " <p> Iris 's face shed some shock and turned eager . " Is it anyone I know ? " <p> " I do n't think so . You may have heard of him , but I 'm not going to say his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Iris . <p> " You mean he 's famous ? " Iris took the watch and reverently inspected it . " It 's perfectly gorgeous . Do you wear it all the time ? Has n't Kirk seen it ? " <p> " I told him I bought it for myself . Look at the inscription . " <p> Lightly etched in florid italic behind the face was " Had we but world enough and time ... " <p> " Oh my God , " Iris groaned , as if with pain or longing . She returned the watch to Maureen . They were quiet while they finished the envelopes , except that every few minutes Iris looked at Maureen , shook her head and sighed . <p> Iris left by the back door . She had pulled her car into the driveway . Maureen went outside with her to help her load the boxes of envelopes into the trunk . Several cicadas clacked in the hawthorn tree by the garage . Lifting the top box off Iris 's stack , Maureen whispered , " His skin is fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes slide , and stuffed envelopes splattered onto the driveway . <p> He never , after that first time , carried her up the stairs . Rather , he waited for her to go up ahead of him . She knew , though she did n't look back , that he liked to watch her haunches shift and flex beneath her clothes , lifting her weight deftly . She stopped wearing underwear , and she rolled up the stairs on the balls of her feet , her torso listing easily forward . She had never felt so lithe . She could see , though she did n't look back , his face as he watched her , interested merely at first , then lit by joy and a certain youthful astonishment . She heard his naive , grateful breathing at the foot of the stairs . <p> Soon he would follow her . She would wait for him in bed with a book open , her husband sleeping beside her . He would enter the room naked . He was covered with down : hair light and soft as corn silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bedside lamp it shimmered around him . His face and forearms glowed . " You look like an angel , " she would whisper , and she would move quietly and lift the comforter to let him into bed beside her . " An archangel . " <p> Late one night she sat in the kitchen with the lights off , and there came the familiar thunking clamor up the basement stairs . Her eyes popped open so suddenly she almost fell off her stool ; and she braced herself for a niggling barrage from one of the boys : a shirt needed ironing , a book needed buying , a failed summer-school test needed signing . She turned an irritated face toward the head of the stairway , and Kirk emerged . He had been working on the monthly bills downstairs at the family-room desk . He carried a creased piece of paper , which he slammed onto the counter in front of her , covering the beet stain . It was the VISA bill . <p> " I 've had it . " He swung his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung furiously as if he were trying to kill a bat . Fluorescence flickered , flashed , then illuminated the room . Maureen blinked . Hal stood up from his chair by the table and vanished . <p> Kirk 's voice became quiet , and his face came close to Maureen 's . His lips moved with a frightening elasticity . " You sit in the dark and talk nonsense . " His mouth stretched toward his ears . Maureen flinched . " You , I used to know , I ca n't talk to you . You spend two thousand dollars on a watch when you already have a watch . " He turned away from her . He sobbed once . His shirt was damp between the shoulder blades . " I wish someone else had bought it for you . " He spoke normally now , as if after one sob he felt better . " I think you should see a doctor . " <p> " Never , " she said with equanimity . She guessed she would have something interesting to talk about to one now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without remorse . <p> She slid the VISA bill aside so she could see the red stain on the wood counter . It had soaked into the grain and gone brown . It could have been anything now : grape juice , mildew , a scorch from a hot saucepan , blood . <p> " I think you 'd better get your brain in gear . Shape up . The next time you wreck the car the kids are likely to be with you . Really . Straighten up and fly right . " <p> " Kirk , I would n't exactly call it a wreck . " <p> " What would you call it ? " <p> " A ding . Somebody sideswiped me in the grocery store lot . I was n't even there . It was n't my fault . I was parked just fine . " <p> " I do n't even know what you 're talking about . So what else is new ? " He flung his arms over his head hopelessly . " I 'm talking about running into the light pole " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At work she had backed out of her parking place the week before ... into a pole , crunching in the trunk of the car . Hal had been with her . He had laughed at the dismayed look on her face and at the way the damaged car looked  --  like a big blue duck , he said , with its turned-up tail . <p> Kirk got quiet again . " What 's wrong with you ? " he asked . <p> She saw the familiar mole on his forehead and a wet dab on his mustache  --  a tear Something thick rose in her throat . " I want you to laugh when I bang in the car . I want you to understand me ; and when you do n't , I do n't want to be told I 'm crazy . I want to be told I 'm mysterious . " <p> Kirk pushed out his lower lip and blew a long breath upward , as if he were trying to dry the tear from his mustache . " Well , do n't look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm telling you you 're a pain in the ass . " <p> She was sorry to have made Kirk angry ; she did n't like to fight with him . But it gave her satisfaction to have expressed her simple desires in a straightforward manner . If they made him angry , she could n't help it . <p> Meanwhile , her days with Hal went happily along . Some days Hal came to work with her . It was early summer , and together they took long walks through the neighborhood to see the trees sprouting new leaves . It had been a dryish spring  --  no storms to rattle the foliage  --  so the flowering shrubbery kept blooming through June . They had to push heavy lilac boughs from their faces as they walked the sidewalks . Hal kept pace beside her in his ambling , arm-swinging way . He walked unlike other men she knew , like someone who had never carried a briefcase . His own favorite was a pair of ornamental crab apples in a yard a few blocks from Maureen 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired the little pink trees so much that one evening they sat down under them and watched the dusk and listened to the neighborhood dogs start baking at each other until Maureen glanced at the house and saw one of the front room curtains jerk open and someone look out . They got up and moved lazily down the street , the length of their forearms touching . <p> At home , she heard his steel toes lightly clicking on the floors even when he was not visible . The sound reminded her of a time years before when one of her sons had decided to be a tap dancer . She had signed him up for lessons , bought him tap shoes ; and for the next two months , until his interest waned , instead of walking he had inelegantly tapped everywhere , especially favoring the tiled bathroom floor . The clattering , the silvery marks throughout the house , and the danger of broken tiles had annoyed Kirk to no end ; but Maureen was sure she remembered enjoying those noisy days , even before Hal 's echoings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery store with her these days , and her mind was more on him than on food . They were playful and happy there . It was a hallowed place for them , because they had met there . Weekly they bought pounds of leeks . Maureen giggled and blushed whenever they came to the cucumber , and made the same joke each time : " One still has to buy cucumbers , does n't one ? " And each time Hal laughed . She danced to the jazz on the piped-in radio . She dropped things : they seemed to turn slimy and slip through her fingers . Often she came home with bruised apples and melons preposterously squashed . Her boys insisted she should switch grocery stores : the fruit was no good anymore at this one . Once , during a discussion of warhorses and their saddles , she dropped a stack of five chicken pot pies on the way from the freezer to her cart ; and the grocer helped he pick them up and gave her five new ones , because the pastry might be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unload at the register . " I think he thinks I 'm palsied or dim-witted , " she confided later to Hal . <p> Maureen was as unprepared for Hal 's death as she had been for his arrival . The encyclopedia did n't say how it happened , nor did Shakespeare , who left him gaily wooing in one play and took up the next at his funeral . Kirk was out of town at the time , at a convention of public-works executives . The last cicada had attacked that day . It had veered at her drunkenly from behind the back door as she was returning from dropping the boys at baseball practice . She had ducked and closed her eyes so she would n't see its fierce , red-eyed foolish face ; and when she made it panting into the house , she went straight upstairs to get a sweater . She was cold , whether from a chill in the air , fear of the cicada , or from a premonition of sorrow she did n't know . She entered the bedroom and headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure sitting on her bed . She thought at first it was Hal , but only for a second . It was a squat , menacing man , she saw , when he rose noisily to stand , fully armored . Its arms splayed out far from its sides because of the bulk of metal in its armpits ; it could not bring its legs very close together either , so it teetered as it rose , then stood by Maureen 's bed as if astride a short , invisible horse . It was Hal 's uncle , the Earl of Exeter . She recognized him from the movie . He looked a little like an actor she had seen once or twice on Masterpiece Theatre . She had wondered , watching the movie , why , since this fellow was apparently the only Briton who could afford a proper suit of armor , he had n't at least bought one for his nephew the king , who went to battle in that flimsy padded tunic covered with dirty lions . Immediately , before he even spoke , she felt resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him the questions of armor , stinginess and the value of the king 's body once they had introduced themselves . But after a creaky bow and before she had a chance to open her mouth , Exeter launched into a speech : <p> We mourn in black ; why mourn we not in blood ? Henry is dead , and never shall revive : Upon a wooden coffin we attend ; And Death 's dishonourable victory We with our stately presence glorify , Like captives bound to a triumphant car . What shall we curse the planets of mishap That plotted thus our glory 's overthrow ? Or shall we think the subtle-witted French Conjurers and sorcerers , that , afraid of him By magic verses have contriv 'd his end ? <p> Without a pause he clanged out of the bedroom and was gone . <p> It took Maureen some while to digest his meaning . When she understood that Hal was dead , she lay down on her bed like an effigy , with her hands folded across her belly . She had cramps . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death : it was the planets of mishap . She knew she had to construct a proper death . It would be good for her , something to occupy her mind . Illness was inappropriate  --  too undramatic . He had to die in battle or be hit by a bus . She settled upon battle . She rose , in pain , to do her little research , then lay back down , grateful after all for the insubstantialities of Exeter 's and the encyclopedia 's accounts . How nice that she would be allowed to give Hal the sort of glorious passage to Valhalla he would enjoy . She devised a wound , but not too bloody a one , and nothing that would mark his ruddy young face . She 'd given birth to him without pain , and she wanted to give him as little as possible in return when she killed him . An arrow in the shoulder would be good , like cowboys used to get in the movies , but more serious . As he expired in the arms of a weeping foot soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his muddy studded gloves to take to he . Somehow it got lost later . Hordes of haggard warriors massed round him , heads bowed , and hummed a requiem as he expired . Ravens the size of large cats tipped the branches of a nearby oak . His horse stood over him until the last breath ( sweet pungent breath ) , then whinnied , teared , whirled , and galloped away into the hills . <p> Maybe she had known since the parking lot , when she had decided not to run him over with her car , that eventually she would have to kill him . There was no avoiding the treacherous ambiguities of their affair . ( It had occurred to her , before he had spoken , that Exeter had come to accuse her of incest and haul her to the Tower , where she would melt into a retroactive footnote . ) She planned to choke back the feeling that she was guilty of murder : some more or less scandalous end had been inevitable . <p> After she had arranged the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night for two weeks in the kitchen . Two of her sons ' white mice died the day after Hal did , electrocuted by a naked wire behind the basement refrigerator where they had fled when Maureen left the cage door ajar after feeding them . The boys assumed , when she served them supper sobbing , that she was wracked with guilt because of her absent-mindedness . <p> Kirk stayed out of town for a week and a half and when he returned he tried not to see her mourning . Perhaps he accepted , by default , the mouse explanation from the boys . He talked to her a little about his convention , about people he had run into that she knew . " It 's nice of you to talk to me , " she warbled , licking tears from her upper lip . <p> When she finally stopped crying , she still had her memories . She remembered Hal 's untameable hair . She re-created his renderings of Keats , rifling through her messy library till she found the lines from Endymion  --  , <p> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , garlands , love-knots , silly posies , Groves , meadows , melodies , and arbour roses <p>  --  and she remembered , without exactly locating it , " ... the spirit is beside thee whom thou seekest ... " Keats had been one of their joint favorites ; Endymion took on new proportions for her now  --  the story of a boy dreaming of loving the moon  --  though she could not make the poetry sound like Hal had . She remembered his lathery laughing mouth when she had taught him how to brush his gleaming new teeth . She remembered his acne , his habit of fiddling with his right earlobe , and the way he liked to chomp his leeks raw and unclean . <p> Her grief achieved now a certain calm , but these scattered recollections were not quite satisfying ; so she stayed home from work one day and relived everything from beginning to end-from cucumbers to Exeter , through beet juice to the blood of the roast beef , which she saw now as allied omens of startings and finishings . She stayed awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved fast , but never got tired . It was recreation . The wild hair on his large head was not as real as it could be . This murder turned out to be the best thing she had made . Memory was memory , after all : who could doubt it ? Not even Kirk , nor Iris . She was now a bona fide widow , as deserving of her sadness as any woman who had lost a lover or husband , because what she had now was as real as what any of them had . She was queen of England and France , and still alive to boot , unlike the poor widow Katharine , who had n't even any brain scraps left to play among . <p>
