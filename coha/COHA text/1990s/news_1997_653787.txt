<p> YOU may think you 're seeing things when your phone bill shows that calls to a friend in a neighboring town are more expensive than calls to your sister on the other coast . <p> Your eyesight is n't failing , but do n't despair : There are ways to save money on your regional phone bills . <p> For a dozen years , regional phone service was a monopoly of the regional Bell companies created by the breakup of the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984 . But with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which was intended to open local and regional service to long-distance companies , a sometimes-bewildering choice of providers and plans is being offered for regional calling . <p> Long-distance carriers like AT &T,; MCI and Sprint have started providing regional service , and the regional Bell companies have responded to the competition with rate cuts . <p> Consumers will find that it pays to shop around in today 's $6 billion residential regional market . While consumers vary greatly in their calling patterns , it is not impossible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save 10 to 40 percent on its regional phone bill . <p> " One of the goals of the Telecommunications Act is to provide competition for local and regional phone service , " said Tracy Waldon , an economist with the Federal Communications Commission . " Consumers will ultimately be able to see a drop in these rates , just like they did with long-distance rates . " In fact , since the AT &T; breakup , which paved the way for competition in the long-distance market , phone rates have come down by 50 percent , Mr. Waldon said . <p> Regional calls are those placed within one of the country 's 199 Local Access and Transport Areas . A LATA can be statewide in a small state ; there are multiple LATA 's in larger states . ( California has 11 . ) A regional call may be from New York City to White Plains in Westchester County , or from Miami to Boca Raton , Fla . And LATA 's are not necessarily based on area code boundaries . <p> WHEN you set up your phone service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-distance carrier , thus flagging the consumer to the possibility of a choice . But depending on the state , such a warning need not be made regarding regional calling . As a result , many people are not aware that there is now a choice . <p> " You should check out all the various regional rate plans being offered , especially if you make a high volume of calls , " said Eric Strumingher , first vice president and telecommunications analyst with Paine Webber in New York . <p> MCI announced a plan in June that offers 24-hour flat-rate regional calling with savings of 15 percent to 59 percent over existing regional tolls , depending on location , said a spokesman , Brad Burns . The plan is being offered in all states but Alaska . <p> In California , MCI 's new regional calling rate is 4 cents a minute , which MCI says is 42 percent lower than Pacific Bell 's average basic rate . A five-minute evening call with Pacific Bell from San Jose to San Francisco is 52 cents ; the same call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The search for cheaper service is n't always easy . The regional plans often vary widely , with a low teaser rate offered for weekend night or late-night calls only . Or there may be fine print noting that a low rate is available only for those who pay a monthly access charge or whose regional bills reach a certain number of calls or minutes . <p> Such apples-and-oranges pricing is pointed up by Pacific Bell 's response to MCI 's assertions about its California rates . <p> " MCI 's rates may be a little lower than ours , but these claims are way out of proportion , " said a Pacific Bell spokesman , John Britton . " They 're comparing their lowest possible rates to Pac Bell 's highest rate . " <p> One trouble with the new competitors is that customers often need to dial a cumbersome five-digit code to use a provider other than a local Bell company for regional phone service . This practice varies state to state . <p> The easier way , of course , is to have customers choose a regional carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method : a " 1 " followed by an area code and a telephone number , known as " one-plus dialing . " Currently , 16 states have one-plus dialing ; the other 34 require the use of access codes in some areas . <p> Each state 's public service commission decides when to roll out one-plus dialing . It was mandated by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , however , that when Bell companies enter the long-distance market , they must also provide one-plus dialing for all other carriers that offer regional calling to their customers . Currently , Bell companies are not in the long-distance market . <p> Another big long-distance company , Sprint , started offering lower regional rates in 1996 in states that have one-plus dialing . These rates vary from 5 cents to 30 cents a minute , depending on location and time of day , said Joseph Mandacini , senior marketing manager . <p> Again , Sprint and Bell Atlantic make claims and counterclaims on regional services . <p> In New York State , Mr. Mandacini said , customers who use Sprint 's intra-LATA service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with further reductions expected . <p> In response , a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman , Joan Rasmussen , said : " They 're comparing apples to oranges . Companies can make all kinds of claims , but consumers should check for themselves . " <p> AT &T's; One-Rate plan offers set prices per minute for regional and long-distance calls , saving consumers 10 to 40 percent on these calls over their regional Bell rates , said Jack McMaster , vice president for growth markets , consumer markets division . AT &T's; regional service is offered in 14 states and in parts of 22 others . <p> As in long-distance calling , some of the companies are household names , while others are smaller and may offer cheaper services . LCI International , a provider of long-distance service and voice and data transmission services based in McLean , Va. , announced plans in July to offer regional one-plus calling in select regions in 23 states , said Roy Gamse , senior vice president for business marketing . The service , he added , could save customers up to 30 percent on these calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate five-digit code . <p> In New York , a highly competitive market , Bell Atlantic offers a variety of plans to customers , depending on their past calling patterns . One Bell Atlantic customer in New York City who makes few calls has an " unlimited regional calling plan " that includes unlimited calls to Westchester and Long Island for a flat monthly charge of $6 , coupled with unlimited local calls at $1.63 a month . At another extreme , a Westchester resident without an unlimited plan might pay Bell Atlantic 's " basic local services " charge of about $10 monthly , plus $30 for about six hours of calls within the region in a month . <p> Local phone companies around the country have been gradually lowering their regional rates and these are worth a closer look , Mr. Strumingher noted . While long-distance providers , in some cases , can still offer more competitive regional rates than the local carriers , the gap is narrowing . <p> But again , the choices can be bewildering : in one Pacific Bell plan , customers receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , and a 40 percent reduction if calls total more than $45  --  at a charge of $4.50 a month . Searching Out Your Best Deal <p> So you think you may want to change your regional phone carrier but are totally confused about which carrier to choose ? <p> You are probably not alone . Just remember the days when long-distance service was first deregulated , and you were bombarded with offers from a host of new competitors . Many people did n't know where to turn then , either . <p> Following are some tips to help you decide which company should provide your regional calling : <p> * Understand and analyze your regional calling patterns . Do you make most of your calls on weekends and evenings . Are you mostly calling just one or two phone numbers ? Are your phone calls lengthy ? The answers can help you select a plan that will save money each month . <p> * Shop around . Ask carriers about their different plans and select the one that best suits your regional calling habits . <p> For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low as $6.28 a month , or 2.1 cents a minute , if you 're a New York City resident who makes five hours of regional calls a month . That is only a weekend evening rate , however . An MCI plan , on the other hand , would cost $30 a month , or 10 cents a minute , for the same amount of calls . The advantage is that MCI 's offer is a 24-hour flat-rate plan . Smaller carriers are in the market , too . <p> * Check the fine print . You 'll see ads for regional carriers or dial-around services ( dialing 1 plus a five-digit code ) . But some carriers give a low , flat-minute rate in their ads and fail to note that you must pay an access charge or make a minimum number of calls or minimum length of call to get a certain rate . <p> * Bargain for better deals . When telemarketers call you , ask them if they can do better than the offers that have been quoted .
