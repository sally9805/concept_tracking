<p> Were his eyes just a little too blue ? Were her sobs just a bit too much ? In a courtroom , what ideal conditions have to come together to win a sexual assault case ? <p> Legal experts agree there is no magic formula , but in the case of William Kennedy Smith , almost all agree that the prosecutor bungled the job . Add that to the lack of convincing evidence , and a jury stacked against the plaintiff , her case was unwinnable . The Kennedys hired nationally known jury expert Cathy Bennett , 40 , to help defense lawyer Roy Black select the six men and women who decided Smith 's fate . If there were a magic formula for a conviction , jurors on sexual assault cases would be younger and less conservative than the Kennedy jury of four women and two men  --  mostly Republicans in their 50s and 60s  --  say some attorneys and legal experts . <p> Bennett , who has assisted in many important cases , including that of automaker John DeLorean , believes lawyers must create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways and foster a less intimidating process , in order to elicit candid responses . She has taught lawyers to be " feeling , loving human beings , and let that come across to the jury , " civil rights lawyer Morris Dees , who has worked frequently with Bennett , told the New York Times . <p> In an ideal courtroom , the accused would have looked sleazy , and the victim would not have sobbed uncontrollably , which led at least two jurors and an alternate to admit that all that crying did n't help them believe her story . <p> Alternate juror Judith Jackson told Newsday , " I thought it was a little too much . It 's been a long while since it happened . And ( defense lawyer Roy Black ) would ask some of the same questions and she would n't cry . " <p> What if your witness breaks into a fit of giggles on the stand , as did one of Karyn Sinunu 's rape victims ? Sinunu , head of the sexual assault division of the Santa Clara County District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen all sorts of emotional responses from victims on the stand , from giggling to crying , to not even being able to make eye contact with anyone in the room . I had one woman get sick to her stomach . She almost made it out of the room . " <p> Jurors need to be reminded that everyone handles stress differently , which can help win a case for the rape victim . <p> " The best way to try these cases is not to prep the victim  --  let the victim be herself  --  but prep the jury by getting them to understand that there is n't only one way for a sexual assault victim to act . The response most jurors expect is crying , but maybe not too much crying . In the case of the woman who giggled  --  which was a very bizarre reaction  --  I had to explain that she was very nervous and that she was n't laughing at the situation . My jury ended up convicting the man in that case . " <p> In the ideal courtroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the victim , while grunting out monosyllabic answers . A blue-eyed , articulate , educated and soft-spoken man does not compute with the stereotype of a rapist . <p> " Given the circumstances that ( Smith ) was under , I think that he did outstanding , " said juror Lea Haller , 37 . <p> " People walk around with the idea that a rapist is a drooling animal with stubble on his chin and a twitch in his eye , " said Ken Burr , senior deputy district attorney at the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office . " Real rapists come in all shapes and sizes and demeanors , but most folks do n't want to believe that they do . There has to be a certain receptivity in the community to be open to the idea of convicting somebody of this kind of crime . " <p> THE DATING GAME <p> In the case of date rape , younger jurors who have themselves experienced the bar scene in their dating days  --  or perhaps are still dating  --  may have a clearer picture about how boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to choose a jury that understands that dating practices have changed dramatically in the last few years , " said Jill Hiatt , a deputy district attorney for Alameda County . " It used to be your mother knew his mother , you met them in highly socially acceptable situations , not in a bar . You had four jurors ( in the Kennedy trial ) who grew up in a time when those kinds of things were n't happening . " <p> " Jurors with broader life experiences are better ; something as small as the distinction of whether she picked him up , or he picked her up . I have three sons ; from the time they were in junior high school , girls have been asking them out regularly . It 's considered normal now . " <p> When the jury members finally go into a locked room to deliberate in a rape case , they must repeat words and situations of a highly sexual nature that most people do n't even like to think about . <p> " They are going to have to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about with spouses , " said Sinunu . " These things are so out of the realm of their imaginations ; it seems easier to believe that sexual violence does n't really happen . " <p> DENYING SEXUAL VIOLENCE <p> This thought was echoed by several other Bay Area attorneys , who believe sexual assault cases are difficult to win because people  --  young or old  --  do not like to dwell on the idea of sexual violence . <p> " Those who make up juries in general still do not want to comprehend the severity of sexual assault against women and go out of their way to pretend it does n't happen , " said Marcia Blackstock , executive director of Bay Area Women Against Rape . " We try to deny the reality of sexual assault because it makes us feel safer ; if we really take a look at that , it 's terrifying . " <p> Perhaps surprising is that most rapes are date rapes . Melanie Boyd , direct services coordinator for San Francisco Women Against Rape , said that national studies indicate that 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . <p> " That definitely holds up with the calls we get on our crisis line , " Boyd said . <p> Winning sexual assault cases is difficult under the best of circumstances . But what it may boil down to is just waking up on the right side of the bed . <p> " You need to be real lucky , " said Hiatt . " You need a jury that is as close as possible to being peers with the victim , and also on similar economic and educational levels ; you need a victim who is able to hold herself together when she 's testifying , and you need everything else to fall together . You also need to be having a good day , when you are feeling strong , and that 's probably critical . "  --  <p> WHAT VICTIMES SHOULD DO RIGHT AFTER RAPE <p> Because rape rarely happens in front of an audience , cases are not usually based heavily on witness corroboration of the victim 's story . And because testimony in rape cases usually boils down to a he-said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even in date-rape cases , where consent is often the defense , and physical evidence is not as big a factor for the prosecution , there are still things a rape victim can do to make it easier to win her case , according Jill Hiatt , a deputy district attorney with the Alameda County District Attorney 's Office . <p> * Call 911 as soon as possible . The sooner the report is made , the better it will be for the prosecution . If you feel uncomfortable calling the police , the next best thing is to call the Rape Treatment Center at ( 415 ) 821-3222 . At the very least , call a friend who can help and also corroborate your story . <p> * Do n't bathe or wash in any way . <p> * Do n't wash your clothes or throw them away . <p> * If a condom was used ( which can happen in both date rape and stranger rape cases ) , try to remember where it was discarded . <p> * If physical force was used but bruises are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used . If bruises appear later , have photographs taken by the police . <p> * If the attack occurred in your house , make sure nothing is touched or moved . <p> * If the attack occurred outdoors , try to remember the exact location , so you can lead police to the scene for evidence . <p> * Memorize everything you can about the rapist , including his car , the interior of the car , even the smell of a cologne . Try to remember his clothing , particularly his underclothing . Try to remember any peculiarities of the rapist  --  scars , tattoos ,
