The last few decades have seen a growing nationwide interest in helping artists create more work . Cities have used grants , loans , and tax credits to produce affordable places for artists to Uve and work , while private , nonprofit endeavors have given financial assistance to artists . Also on the rise are residency programs , where artists are pro- vided time and space to work . " Most residency programs for artists have been created in the last 25 to 30 years , " says Caitlin Strokosch , the director of the Alliance of Artists Communities , which has more than 250 members in the United States . " About 10 new programs are introduced every year , and most address the evolving needs and approaches of today 's emerging artists . " The definition of an artist-inresidence program has been expanding with the number of programs available . An artist-in-residence at Skidmore College , in Saratoga Springs , New York , for example , is an adjunct studio faculty member who will " teach and sit in on classes and seminars , supervise students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents , " according to the school 's website . On the other hand , artists-in-residence at Yaddo , the renowned artist community also in Saratoga Springs , receive housing , meals , a stipend , and time and space to work on their own art . Between the two are many variations , including communities that artists pay to attend , others that only provide housing , those that require community service , groundskeeping , or the donation of an artwork , and some that are bed-and-breakfasts or resorts holding art workshops . Many residencies are in rural areas , where the idea is to get away from the distractions that keep artists from completing their work . There are opportunities for resident artists to socialize at Yaddo , but during the day they are expected to work on their own without interrupting others , and bag lunches are left at their studios so their creativity is not disturbed . Although in some artist communities being around other artists is seen as most important , in most residencies the focus is on the work . " In our definition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and space for an artist to create new work , usually for between a few weeks and a year . Artists are selected by some competitive means , such as through jurying or a curator . " She adds that the sponsoring organization need not necessarily be a nonprofit-and it may charge fees-but " it is significantly subsidizing the support it offers artists . " The Alliance of Artists Communities website ( **25;1364;TOOLONG ) has a directory of 300 residency programs that anyone can view , searching by such criteria as location , length of time , and specific equipment and facilities . For a $25 subscription fee , you can have access to more details and a monthly e-mail with upcoming deadlines and new job listings . The Alliance credits more than 40 residency programs with having a particular interest in emerging artists and 18 with catering exclusively to emerging artists . Other opportunities for artists in the early stages of their careers include the Seattle-based La Familia Gallery Artist Residency in Alaska , which accepts up to 29 emerging and mid-career artists per year who provide 20 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January the Seaside Institute , in Santa Rosa Beach , Florida , provides artists with housing , studio space , and a weekly meal allowance , asking them to offer a public presentation . The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco have one-month residencies for local artists , who are given a stipend and work space . Offering lectures or workshops is optional , but artists must be on-site at least four hours a day , five days a week . The community service requirement is a notable element in many of the newer artists ' communities , reflecting a belief that artists should not be isolated from the world and that the arts should be integrated into a larger program of ecological and public awareness . Embodying this holistic view is the Sustainable Arts Society at Blue Ridge , in Atlanta , which charges $65 a day for room and board and internet access and requires some community outreach and daily work on the farm . Similarly , at the Salina Art Center , in Salina , Kansas , artists perform weekly studio tours , workshops , and demonstrations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Park Service . Unlike other artist communities , this program brings in one artist at a time . The three-week residency includes housing but no stipend . Artists are required to donate an artwork that represents their experience there , and they also may be asked to hold a demonstration or a talk for park visitors . Most residencies are not free-even the National Park Service program assumes artists will provide their own food and art materials , as well as pay their rent and any other expenses at home-and finding the means to pay for them is not easy . However , those seeking financial help do have options . A number of state arts agencies offer professional-development grants to individual artists , which may be used to pay for workshops , seminars , mentoring , specialized training , and sometimes travel costs . In addition , several private , nonprofit organizations allow artists to apply for funding to pay for the cost of a residency . Among them are the Jerome Foundation , in St. Paul , Minnesota , the Leeway Foundation , in Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arts .
