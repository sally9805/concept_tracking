CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS OFTEN get nervous stomachs when they hear talk of synergy , that snaggle-toothed harbinger of bad mergers . So Aetna Life &; Casualty Co. chairman Ronald Compton was administering verbal sedatives last week when he talked about the proposed merger between Aetna and U.S. Healthcare Inc. that will create the country 's largest medical-benefits corporation . " The two companies are in fact complementary , " said Compton . " They are yin and yang . " <P> Feel better now ? If the deal is approved by stockholders , as expected , the combined entity , to be known as Aetna Inc. , will provide health care for 23 million people , or 1 in every 12 Americans . The $8.9 billion merger , which mirrors a recent batch of smaller consolidations in the managed-care field , is a clear signal that big medicine is here to stay , whether you like its bedside manner or not . " The main effect of the huge merger is that it will be replicated by insurers across the country , " says Kenneth Abramowitz , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The pressure to get big  --  and to use that leverage against other competitors , doctors and hospitals  --  is spreading like a virus through the entire industry . " These giant health-care mergers are happily galloping toward an oligopoly , " says Sara Nichols , Washington director of the nonprofit Physicians for a National Health Care Program . Wall Street analysts foresee a day in the not-too-distant future when the whole country 's health-care needs will be largely served by a handful of providers . <P> What this contraction of services will mean for consumers produces a yin-yang split in perception . Optimists predict that the half-dozen or so remaining big players , with their enlarged networks , will have the clout to force doctors and hospitals to hold down medical costs , which will stabilize premiums for individual and corporate customers . " We 're the only mature industrial society on the face of the earth that does n't like big , " says Compton . " Which would you rather have ? A few real efficient giants competing with one another , or 30 or 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeptics wonder how consumers can benefit from fewer choices , be it in airlines or medicine . They also voice concern that patient care will collide with the profit motive and get the worst of it . Under a system known as capitation , which pays HMO providers a set monthly fee for each enrolled patient , doctors are offered a financial incentive to limit both the number of patients they see and the types of services they provide . Says James Tallon , president of the United Hospital Fund , a philanthropic and health-services research organization in New York City : " In the old system , sick people were what drove the money in . In the new system , sick people are what drive profits out , and that 's the challenge . " <P> As a result , say critics , patients will have to dip into their pockets to obtain the services they really need  --  or go without proper care . " You are going to see lower utilization of high-cost procedures , fewer lab tests , less radiology activity and a very noticeable drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an attorney with Pullman &; Comley , a Connecticut firm that represents health-care providers such as Bridgeport Hospital . " Managed care has too much market power . "
