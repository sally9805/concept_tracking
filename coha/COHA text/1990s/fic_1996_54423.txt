In an issue filled with terrorists , ghosts , and Martians , we need a bit of levity . Fortunately , we had this story by Ron Goulart on hand . " A Cure for Baldness , " according to Ron , " explains the various aspects of growing older . " Hmmm . Would that aging could be so interesting for everyone . <p> It was about a half hour after the second bomb scare that his real trouble got going . Roger Snow had hidden in a closet the second time the fifteen story Tandem Brothers Publishing Building on Park Avenue South was evacuated . Trooping out into the hot , glaring Manhattan street once a day was sufficient . The building never blew up anyway . <p> Roger had sneaked back into his office after five minutes or so , sat again at his drawing board and started working on thumbnail sketches for the latest paperback cover in the Lizardworld series . <p> " Swordsmen of Lizardworld , " he 'd said aloud , allowing himself to sigh some . " Can you fall from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> After awhile he noticed that his hand kept sticking to the layout paper , which meant the air conditioning was on the fritz again . Sighing once more , he leaned back in his chair . The chair produced the usual resentful groaning . <p> Roger was a plump , moderately tall man in his middle forties and his hair was thinning . Well , actually he was going to be forty-seven next month and he was just a shade under five foot eight . He was at least thirty pounds overweight and there was extremely little of his brindle-colored hair left on his head at all . <p> " I 'm starting to sound like a resume when I describe myself , " he reflected . " But you ca n't romance the fact that I 'm going to seed . As a person , as an artist , and  --  " <p> " Just where 's your damn loyalty , Rog ? " <p> " I had it when I came in this  --  " <p> " Enough wiseass stuff . How do you explain this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , everybody in the Fiction Division of Tandem Brothers had returned . Lex Tandem himself was in the doorway of the small office , holding a partially crumpled fax message in his tanned hand . <p> " You have some words written in reverse across the front of your suit , " mentioned Roger . " What does it say ? ' Down with the Colonel ! Tobacco means . . . ' Ca n't make out the next word . " <p> " Death , " supplied Lex . " I got whacked with a placard . You 'd think those halfwits would wait until the paint dried before they started marching around with the damn things . " <p> " Another protest march in front of the building , huh ? " <p> " Did n't you notice it ? Over a hundred wild-eyed loons waving  --  " <p> " Was n't paying attention . " <p> " I tried to explain to this woman  --  large hefty critter , probably lifts weights  --  that the Colonel Lightfoot Tobacco Company sold its interest in Tandem over a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Protestors usually have a narrow view of  --  " <p> " I 'm happy to say it sounded like the cops broke her arm when they tossed her in the wagon . So I got some gratification out of  --  " <p> " They the ones who planted the latest bomb ? " <p> " No , no . Ordek Yumurta is claiming credit again . " <p> " The Turkish terrorist group ? " <p> " How many Ordek Yumurtas do you think there are ? Yes , of course , stupid , the damn Turkish terrorists . " Lex shook his handsome head . " They continue , apparently , to be ticked off because we published Dr. Uzon Boylu 's book last month . It 's a shame because that book  --  what the bloody hell is that ? " He was pointing a tanned finger at a cover painting that leaned against the far wall . <p> " Cover for Dr. Suicide novel #46 . Slit Throats in Singapore . Why ? " <p> " It 's godawful . " <p> " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commencing with #40 . " <p> " I thought I suggested wretched . " <p> " It 's that , too . " <p> " I 'm straying from the point . " <p> " About Dr. Boylu , you mean ? " <p> " No , not exactly . Although it is a fact that Think Tall has helped me one hell of a lot . And how many other publishers can say they actually get anything from any of the dimwit books they publish ? " <p> " The correct answer is fourteen . " <p> " What did I tell you about the wiseass stuff ? <p> " To stop . " <p> " Exactly . Before I read Boylu 's wonderful book I suffered from not being especially tall . " <p> " You 're short , Lex . " <p> " No , five foot two is not technically short . " <p> " It is , yeah . Besides , you 're only four foot eleven . " <p> " I was , but after reading Boylu 's book and applying his teachings  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimbulb can see I look much taller . " <p> " That 's only because you 've taken to walking funny . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " You go around on tiptoe now and sort of stretch your neck . " <p> " Sure , that 's all part of the Boylu System . In order to think tall , you have to stand tall , " explained the publisher . " But actually  --  I came here to talk about the new assignment I have for you . " <p> " I 've got sufficient assignments , what with recruiting artists for Dr. Suicide covers and Lizardworld and the new Lethal Injector series and  --  " <p> " This involves not art but travel . " He took , on tiptoe , a step back and cocked his head to the right . " It 'd be nice if you had more hair and less chins , but maybe Olive Bunce has different tastes than  --  " <p> " Whoa , no . Wait . " He pushed back from his board . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or  --  " <p> " On the contrary , Rog , you are . You 're going out to California , in just three weeks , " said the publisher . " Otherwise . . . " Shrugging , he glanced over his shoulder at the door . <p> " You ca n't fire me . I have tenure , not to mention  --  " <p> " Tenure is for academics . But , do n't fret , if you can bring off this simple task , you 're set for life . " <p> " Any chore that remotely involves Olive Bunce can not be classified as simple . " <p> " Follow along with me as I explain things to you . " His boss smoothed out the fax he 'd been clutching . " For the past two years , lord only knows why , Olive Bunce has been the top mystery thriller writer in the nation . Her latest compilation of tripe , Red Blood Reigns , has been on the lamebrained Times best-seller list for untold eons . The paperback of her Blood upon the Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped to #1 this past weekend . But , be that as it may , Lex , I wo n't be  --  " <p> " Let me make two very important points . Firstly , Olive Bunce 's contract with Blitzkrieg Books is about to expire . She is now being courted by just about every major publisher . " <p> " I hear Barson &; Sons offered her $42,000,000 for her next three  --  " <p> " We can match any offer those nitwits make . In fact , we 'll top anybody 's offer , " the publisher assured him as he came inching forward . " And we have an ace in the hole in you . " <p> " Nope , not an ace . A Jack or a Queen , maybe a ten , but  --  " <p> " She loves you , does n't she ? " <p> " Loved . Years in the past . Maybe . " <p> " I 'm betting she still does . Those college romances are intense and never forgotten . " <p> " We only dated for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever mentioned it to you . The thing is , we were n't exactly Scott and Zelda or  --  " <p> " But you slept with her , did n't you ? " <p> " I do n't feel like discussing my long ago sex life with you . I 've been married for better than fifteen years and  --  " <p> " And damn lucky you are . If it was n't for Natalie I would n't even have found out about this terrific opportunity for us to beat all the opposition . " <p> " Natalie ? What does my wife have to do with this ? " <p> " Natalie . bless her pretty blonde head , sent me this . " He fluttered the fax . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " It 's the final notice from the Class of ' 68 Committee of the Bayshore College Alumni Association . If you do n't send your money in by this Friday , Rog , you 'll miss the 25th Reunion . It 's being held at the palatial Hotel Fairview , nestled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay . " <p> " I 'm not attending that . I 've never been to a damn class reunion and I 'm not starting now . I have n't even set foot in California for sixteen years . " <p> " Note this line  --  ' Keynote Speaker at the Reunion Banquet will be Olive Bunce . ' " <p> " Noted . " <p> " You 're fortunate that your wife thinks more of the company than you do . " <p> " Natalie really sent that to you ? " <p> " The original came in today 's mail and once Natalie spotted it , she knew what to do . " <p> " She opened my personal mail and shared it with a stranger , huh ? " <p> " It 's an invitation , not anything confidential . And I 'm far from being a stranger , " countered the publisher . " Natalie happens to be aware that we 're anxious to get Olive Bunce in our stable . " <p> " Listen , Lex , I have absolutely no influence on Olive . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . " <p> " She 's divorced . " <p> " So ? " <p> " Well , the loves of our youth are the deepest and truest . " <p> " I know , that was the blurb on the jacket of Sins of the Flesh . Even so , I  --  " <p> " Here 's something else I want you to think over , Rog . Either get ready for a trip out to California  --  or put all your crap in a cardboard box and vacate this office by sundown . " <p> Roger took another look out his window . " Will you pay all my expenses for the reunion ? " he asked finally . <p> " Within reason , sure . " <p> He said , " Okay , I 'll go . I ca n't , though , promise  --  " <p> " I do n't want promises , I want results . " Tandem moved to the doorway . " And see if you can , somehow , improve your overall looks before you head West . " <p> Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an hour earlier than he 'd expected . When he realized that , he was driving his six-year-old Toyota through a rural section of Brimstone , Connecticut that he had n't been in lately . It was ten minutes shy of three and the afternoon was warm and somewhat hazy . <p> On his left he passed an abandoned roadside produce stand , an empty field and then a freshly painted cottage . Attached to a post in front of the house was a rustic sign  --  Samson Institute : We Can Grow Hair Anywhere . <p> Roger slowed , then braked . He swung the car across the lane and onto the white gravel driveway . He parked in front of the cottage and sat for a moment in his car , robbing at his nearly hairless head . " Guy 's probably a quack , " he murmured . " But I am going to need hair in California . " <p> Sighing , he eased out into the humid afternoon . While still three paces from the bright red front door , he heard an enormous ramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crackling sizzle of lightning . But it all seemed to come from inside the Samson Institute . <p> Deciding this could be an emergency , he sprinted to the door . He ignored the brass horseshoe knocker and tried the handle . <p> The door opened and he stepped into a cluttered parlor . The smell of smoke was thick all around and there was also a sulfurous odor . Sprawled in the exact center of a large shaky pentagram that had been sketched on the bare hardwood floor in pale blue chalk was a suit of clothes . A brown tweedy suit of clothes , with a frayed blue shirt inside the coat and a mended black sock dangling out of one of the trouser legs . <p> A pair of rimless spectacles lay just outside the farthest point of the pentagram . Near the sock was steepled a thick book bound in pinkish leather . <p> Squatting , Roger read the title , " The Compleat &; Dreadful Magikal Writings of the Notorious Count Monstrodamus . Not too catchy , even for a hardcover . " Standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about anywhere ? " <p> " You know , he got the incantation just about right . But hey , in black magic  --  as in most things , come to think of it  --  almost does n't win you the cigar . " <p> Roger noticed now that someone was seated in a bentwood rocker in the far comer . The chair was ticking slowly back and forth , its high back hitting against a tall book case that was crammed not only with fat ancient books but with lolling stuffed toys , rusty miniature cars , dusty glass animals , clouded crystals and dirt-smeared chunks of rock . <p> " Mr. Samson ? " Roger squinted , but still could n't make out the figure in the chair . That section of the parlor seemed unusually shadowy . <p> The person in the chair chuckled . " No , nope . Samson is . . . well , he 's elsewhere . He 's , yeah , about as elsewhere as you can get . Sad in a way , you know . Here he summoned me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted , reciting Latin backward can be tricky  --  by futzing up that one word , he blew the whole deal . " He chuckled again . " Maybe I can help you ? " <p> " Well , unless you can grow hair , I do n't think  --  " <p> " Hey , no problem . What kind of hair do you want ? And what do you want to grow it on ? " <p> " My head . " He was about to pat his scalp , but he had a sudden feeling that he 'd like to be outside of this cottage and inside his car once again . " That 's all right , though . I can drop in sometime later on , when Mr. Samson is back . " He began a few careful steps backward . <p> " Hard to tell , Mr. Snow , when he 'll turn up again . Considering where Samson is , you know , if he ever does get back , he may , really , have lost all interest in hair . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my name ? " <p> " Simple trick . My name , by the way , is Ford Madox Ford . " <p> " No , it 's not . Ford Madox Ford was some kind of British novelist who had a book of his done on Masterpiece Theater once . He 's dead . " <p> " That 's true . Actually Ford Madox Ford , is an assumed monicker . My real handle is . . . " A huge roaring sound , accompanied by a crimson gust of flame , came out of the shadows . " For occasions such as this , however , I prefer to use Ford . " <p> Roger lowered himself down into a plump armchair . " Nice meeting you , Mr. Ford . " <p> " So why do you want hair ? " <p> " Oh , it 's sort of complicated . " <p> " Hold it . I 'll read your mind . Faster . " <p> Nodding , Roger pointed at the sprawl of empty clothes with his shoe toe . " Was Samson inside those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samson of the Samson Institute . Was he wearing those up until  --  " <p> " Yep , you just missed the guy . Whoosh ! Right out of his attire and off to elsewhere . They wo n't mind his being jaybird naked over there . " <p> " He dabbled in magic ? " <p> " Black magic , ancient sorcery , stuff like that . " <p> " Was he using black magic and such to grow hair for people ? " <p> " I 'd guess , since his business was n't going all that well , that he was hoping to get some supernatural help . " <p> " You mentioned earlier that he 'd summoned you . What exactly are  --  " <p> " A demon . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Do n't , though , get the notion that my abilities are limited to dull crap like growing hair . Nope , I happen to be a full service , all purpose demon , " explained Ford Madox Ford . " I could , for example , guarantee that Olive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows . " You read about that in my mind , huh ? " <p> " Right , nothing to it . Carny trick . " <p> " And you say you could actually make sure that she  --  " <p> " Are we maybe talking a deal here , Rog ? " <p> " Could you , and I do n't mean to offend you , but could you call me Roger ? Only that putz Lex Tandem calls me  --  " <p> " Roger . You got it . " <p> " The thing that occurs to me , Mr. Ford , is  --  " <p> " You can just call me Ford . " <p> " I 'm wondering , Ford , if this is one of those setups where I have to sell you my soul to get what I want . Or where I end up going off to elsewhere for all eternity . If so , a new head of hair and a contract with Olive is n't worth  --  " <p> " Eternity 's not all that long , but not to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , Roger , what I have in mind . Oh , but first perhaps I ought to decide on a persona . " <p> " Meaning what ? " <p> " Right now I 'm clouding your mind so you ca n't see me clearly , " he explained . " Normally I look like a cross between a cocker spaniel and a Komodo dragon . " <p> " Cockers can be cute . " <p> " Not when blended with a huge lizard . Anyway , Roger , if we 're going to have dealings , then eventually I 'll need a human form . Lately I 've been using an appealing mix of Mickey Rooney and Harlan Ellison , but maybe there 's  --  " <p> " Before we go into what you 're going to look like , " cut in Roger , " I want more details about this deal you have in mind . " <p> The chair ceased to rock . " I want twenty-five percent of your income . " <p> " For the year ? " <p> " Oh , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kind of steep . Fifteen percent would be- " <p> " How many previous deals have you made with demons ? " <p> " Well , none , but I 've been publishing for most of my adult life and I know- " <p> " Twenty percent is as low as I go . " <p> " That 's still not exactly fair . " <p> " Who said demons had to be fair ? " <p> " Okay , twenty percent , then . But , and again I do n't want to annoy you , Ford , but would n't it be easier for you to simply make money with sorcery ? Turn lead into gold with a  --  " <p> " Have you ever seen that done ? The old transmuting base metals dodge ? " <p> " No , but it should n't be too difficult for you . " <p> " It 's a snap , but very dull . No fun at all , " explained the demon . " Do we have a deal ? " <p> " I 'm assuming that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am now . Otherwise , going in with you will only mean  --  " <p> " Think about what befell friend Samson just for futzing up one word . It 's not smart to rile supernatural forces , Roger . " <p> Roger coughed . " Sorry . What about the hair ? " <p> " You got it " A finger snapping sound came out of the shadows . <p> His scalp turned suddenly very warm , felt like it was going to sizzle soon . Tiny popping noises commenced all across the top of his head . Jumping up , Roger touched at his steaming scalp . There seemed to be hair up there . " Mirror around here any place ? " <p> " In the john . Down the hall , second door on your left . " <p> Excusing himself , Roger rushed down to the mirror . He gave a pleased laugh when he saw himself . His head was covered with hair the color and texture of the hair he 'd started to lose way back in his twenties . " This is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got it parted on the wrong side : Could you fix that ? Only if it 's not too much trouble . " <p> The demon did n't reply . <p> Back in the parlor Roger found that both the shadows and Ford Madox Ford were gone from the far side of the room . <p> " I 'm still going to have to explain all this hair to Natalie , " he said as he left the cottage . <p> He was 24,000 feet in the air when he next encountered the demon . Roger had a window seat in the jet , but he was frowning at the notebook open on his tray and paying no attention to the fields of clouds outside . He was making notes on what he intended to do once he hit the reunion . <p> " So what do you think ? " inquired the middle-aged man who was sitting next to him . <p> " Beg pardon ? " <p> " Do I make a convincing human ? " <p> Swallowing , Roger dropped his pencil on the tray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle . " I based my looks on Gene Hackman this time  --  only younger . Do you like his movies ? " <p> " You got the nose wrong . " <p> " It 's a Karl Malden nose . He was great in On the Waterfront . " <p> " Speaking of appearances , I 've been losing a lot of weight . Is that because of you ? " <p> " Yep , all part of the service . We 're getting you in fighting trim . " <p> " Natalie 's been worried . She accepted the hair finally , but she wanted me to see our doctor before taking off on this damn trip . " <p> " She 's not really worried . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " The concern is feigned . Now , let 's talk about  --  " <p> " Listen , I ought to know if my own wife is concerned about me or not . " <p> " Not important , sorry I brought it up . " <p> " At least she sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas you I have n't seen for weeks . Not since we met at the Samson  --  " <p> " I have other clients , other interests , " reminded the demon . " Sometime ask the missus where she goes on Thursday nights . " <p> " She goes to the St. Norbert Vestry Committee Meetings . " <p> Ford Madox Ford chuckled . " Okay , now here 's what I have in mind for you when we arrive in  --  " <p> " What the hell are you hinting at ? That Natalie is  --  " <p> " Nothing not a dam thing . Just clowning around . You know how evil spirits are , always needling . " He tapped the open notebook . " Mapping out your assault on Olive , I see . " <p> " Who 's my wife fooling around with ? " <p> " I 'll fix it so you lose another ten pounds and we 'll get rid of those pouches under your eyes and the extra chin might as well  --  " <p> " You 're supposed to know everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Natalie is  --  " <p> " She 's a charming lady , pretty as a picture . That is my final comment on her . " <p> Roger picked up the pencil , tapped at his chin with the eraser end . He stared out into the afternoon sky . " Okay , all right , " he said finally . " We 'll concentrate on business . " <p> There were at least four hundred people at the reunion cocktail party in the Gold Rush Ballroom of the Hotel Fairview . Thus far something like fifty of them had come up to Roger , squinted at his name tag done a take and said something along the lines of , " Damn , you look better now than you did then . What 's your secret , Rog ? " <p> " Black magic and sorcery , " he 'd reply , chuckling . <p> After awhile he dropped the chuckling . It reminded him of Ford Madox Ford . <p> The demon did n't seem to be in attendance , at least not in his Gene Hackman/Karl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olive Bunce was n't present . <p> " Wig ? " Someone dealt him a sudden poke in the back . <p> He took a surprised jump forward , then , slowly , turned . " Nate ? Are you Nate Karnofsky ? " <p> " I am , " admitted the lean , bald man as he held out his hand . " Is that your own hair ? " <p> " More or less . " He shook hands . " Nate . We used to be . . . " <p> " Buddies . " <p> " Yeah , we were , but then . . . " <p> " We drifted apart . How are you doing ? Did you become a painter ? " <p> " In a way , I 'm an art director for a publishing house . " <p> " I went into real estate . I 'm a millionaire . " <p> " That 's good . " <p> His friend shrugged . " I 'd rather be happy . And you ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat on you ? " <p> " What made you ask that last one ? " <p> " I 've had three wives thus far , Rog , and every damn one of them  --  " <p> " Speaking of women , have you seen Olive Bunce ? " <p> " I have n't , no . But I did encounter Creig Bashford . He was always threatening to deck you if you kept seeing Olive , was n't he ? " <p> " He did deck me . He committed several acts of violence back in college . I even lost part of a tooth . " <p> " Young love , " observed Nate . " Now , about the hair , how 'd you  --  " <p> " Bashford 's here ? " <p> " Over by the bar . Huge as ever , though out of shape , and looking extremely nervous and distraught . " <p> " I 'd just as well avoid the guy . " <p> " Transplant ? " <p> " Hum ? " <p> " Your hair , Rog . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , trust me , want to do what I had to do to get this head of hair . " <p> " Face lift , too , looks like . " <p> " Nope , no . " <p> " Then how do you manage to look  --  " <p> " Black magic and sorcery . " <p> " C'm on , seriously . " <p> " Actually , it 's based on diet and exercise . I 'll send you a couple books by Dr. Uzon Boylu once I get back home , Nate . " <p> " You still living in Pennsylvania ? " <p> " We never lived in Pennsylvania . Connecticut . It 's Connecticut . " He was scanning the milling crowd of people again , hoping for a glimpse of Olive Bunce . <p> " Well , well , my my . It is Roger Snow , is it not ? " A distinguished elderly gentleman put a friendly arm around his shoulders . " Will you excuse us , Mr. Karnofsky , if I spirit Roger off for a little private chat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not at all , Professor . . . " <p> " Terhune . Albert Payson Terhune .

" <p> " Ford ? " He stopped still , almost causing a cruising waiter to walk into him . <p> " I thought you 'd recognize the persona . It 's Robert Donat . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Robert Donat in Good-bye , Mr. Chips . A sentimental film classic . Do n't you ever watch anything on  --  " <p> " From what I 'm vaguely remembering of Robert Donat , he sure did n't have a nose like yours . " <p> " I retained the Malden nose . " <p> " We have a problem , " Roger told the demon . " Olive is nowhere to be  --  " <p> " I know , yes . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford started him moving toward an exit . " We 're going to have to rescue her . " <p> Roger halted again . " Rescue ? " <p> " I fear the lady has been kidnapped . " <p> " Then it 's a job for the police  --  or the FBI . Some outfit with lots of weapons . " <p> " Ah , but should you manage to save Olive , " the demon pointed out , getting him moving again , " consider how grateful she 'll be . She 'd sign with Tandem in a jiffy . " <p> " Think so ? " <p> " Foregone conclusion . " <p> " Just how dangerous could it be ? " <p> " Aw , only moderately . " <p> Roger found himself in a wide , purple-carpeted corridor . " Okay , I 'll try it . " Then he asked , " How come you know about this kidnapping ? " <p> The demon answered , " I keep my ears open . " <p> The abandoned studio-warehouse lay at the end of a rutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town of Bayshore . Perched atop the sprawling building was a giant plastic folksinger , complete with acoustic guitar . His booted left foot was planted atop the F in the large metal Folknik Records sign . <p> " I had a bunch of Folknik LPs when I was in college , " mentioned Roger , who was crouched in the thick brush that bordered the tumbledown wooden fence that had once protected the warehouse . " Yeah , Wayne Purebucket used to record on Folknik . I played his Clean Air , Pure Water Talkin ' Blues all the  --  " <p> " Stow the nostalgia . " Ford Madox Ford was scanning the nearby building with a pair of night binoculars . " They 're at the back of the building . " <p> " You can see them with those glasses ?

" <p> " But he had a tremendous crush on Olive . " <p> " The lad has fallen on hard times . He plans to net $1,000,000 in ransom and then retire to Central America , leaving his debts and responsibilities behind , " explained the demon . " Quite a few of your contemporaries , you know , feel they 've arrived at an age when they ought to start planning their retirement . " <p> " Olive will recognize him and tell the cops eventually . " <p> " He 'll be wearing a sack over his head and disguising his voice . " <p> " Do n't you think , Ford , that a phone call to some law enforcement agency would work as well as a raid by us , " he said . " Then , after they disarm and incapacitate the gang , I can go strolling in and announce , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whistle on this plot . ' " <p> " Here , use this .

" <p> " If the need arises , simply squeeze the trigger . I 've rigged the gun so you ca n't screw up . " <p> " I 'm not particularly keen on shooting anybody . " <p> " This is like diplomacy .

" <p> " You did n't have a gun in those days . " <p> Everything worked out much better than Roger had anticipated . The kidnappers surrendered without a shot being fired and Creig Bashford did n't even try to take a single swing at him . <p> When the police were loading Bashford into the wagon , though , he started claiming loudly that he was only a pawn in this caper .

" I 've gone ahead and hired a marvelous man to be our Advertising Director . He 's had a heck of a lot of experience , in Manhattan and London .
