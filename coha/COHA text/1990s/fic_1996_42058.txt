FROM HIS BALCONY , Fidel Castro Ruz looks to the Strait of Florida . A watery moon illuminates an indigo sea ; the air is moist and cool for the first time all day . Faint rumba music wafts on the air . Streetlamps cast hazy circles over the Malecon , promenade for lovers , bandstand for musicians , studio for dancers , playground for children . Havana theater just before midnight . <p> He puts a finger to his lips in a gesture of concern , the lordly creator saddened tonight by those things his will can not shape . He turns away from the sea . Just then a high-pitched mechanical scream erupts from the waterfront . Fidel flinches and raises his free hand . He hears a burst of air and sees a shower of silver shards that lights up the channel leading to the port . " Ratty . Want to see something ? " There 's no response . " Rat-tee " <p> A parched voice echoes from the distant bathroom . " Who is pretty ? " <p> Fidel barks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ratty Manguin makes his way to the balcony with a twisted limp , advancing like a sidewinder . The play of light and shadow distorts his features more than usual . His head seems immense ; his face is wizened . His nose is a beak with large nostrils ; he has the look of a very ancient Arawak . " What is so pretty ? " " I did n't say pretty . Watch . " <p> In a tense hand Ratty Manguin holds a straight razor . He strops it against the long tongue of his belt . " Where is this pretty ? " Standing against the railing alongside Fidel , the small man appears to be a botched version of the large . Each wears fatigues ; Fidel 's are pressed . Fidel 's dark eye is thoughtful , his smile perfectly even ; the dwarf has one lazy eye , the other bulges , both are dull and discolored . Castro 's beard is full , and almost completely grayed. t has taken Manguin nearly thirty years to raise the oily growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They watch together , Manguin looking at Fidel 's face as often as he looks out to sea . Fidel points . " Fireworks . There was a burst : over the Malecon . Watch . " They wait . There are no more displays . <p> The silence deepens . The distant music begins again ; voices jabber . " There was a great silver burst . A celebration . Perhaps Guevara 's birthday . " <p> At the name , Ratty becomes alert , a lapdog anticipating his master 's arrival . He will never arrive . <p> Fidel hears himself say the name and feels pressure on his temple , his neck , his chest . <p> " You know , Fidelito . You know what we need . " <p> Fidel holds up a warning finger . <p> " The bear fat , Fidelito ? " Offered as an enticement . The daggertooth smile indicates extreme satisfaction . " You could use a good one , I think . The balm has very strong powers in a full moon . " Ratty folds his straight razor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the last ? " <p> " Almost two months . " <p> Fidel rolls his head and shoulders . " It 's true . Lately , a great tension . " <p> Ratty takes that for a yes and dances crookedly toward the bathroom . <p> There are no bears in Cuba . There never have been bears in Cuba . But in Oriente Province the priests of Santeria , the santeros , have spoken for generations about the magical curative powers of Oriente bear fat . Ratty Manguin considers himself an apprentice santero and traces his heritage to a Yoruba priestess , though there is no possible lineage . Fidel is not a believer , so Ratty has not pursued the calling . <p> Ratty wrings his towel in the sink and takes a bar of bear fat from his pouch of sanctified objects . Ratty kisses the rind and touches it to the web of skin between his left thumb and first finger , on which is imprinted the sign of the triple sixes  --  omitted . He is a devotee of Chango , the spirit-god of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , the sixth child , in a village called Six Roads , so 6 and Chango are the shapers of his destiny . <p> Stretched across the desk with his shirt off , Fidel Castro looks like a huge hunting trophy . Portions of his back are thickly covered with curls flecked as gray as his beard . Ratty notices that the hair on the right shoulder has been shaved . " What is this ? " Someone has touched his property . <p> " I 've had it removed . " The answer is casual , almost lazy . " In Barcelona . " Fidel is not talking about body hair . He is referring to his tattoo . " With a laser beam . " <p> Ratty has never heard of this thing . He stares at the spot and is certain he sees the old marking still , appearing like a photographic negative , white on olive skin , the life-sized baseball and the words in English  --  " N.Y . Giants . " There is almost no one alive who knows that Fidel Castro Ruz wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In 1944 , when Fidel was seventeen , the Washington Senators held tryouts all over Cuba . They were open to everyone , but the scouts were given a mocha-tinted piece of paper , like a paint sample , and told anyone darker than that hue must be passed over . It was hard for the scouts because , generally speaking , the darker the skin tone , the greater the talent . Fidel Castro Ruz was the notable exception , the best young pitching prospect on the island . The Washington scouting report on him read : " Excellent control for a kid . Good speed . Big league curve . As white as a baseball . " <p> Before a Senators ' scout could sign the Castro kid , Adolfo Luque , a Cuban scout for the N.Y . Giants and a former major league star , decided to make the torturous trip to Birn to take a look at the phenom . In a clearing alongside Angel Castro 's cane fields , Luque took a catcher 's mitt from his Chevy , laid a soiled towel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches . " Let 's see what your boy 's got , " he said to Angel Castro . Then he squatted with a grunt . " Show me the chili pepper , kid , " he shouted to Fidel . <p> Fidel wound up , kicked his left leg like Luque in his prime  --  all Cuban pitchers did  --  and threw a modest fastball , straight as a string . Luque cocked his head and returned the ball . Fidel threw six more such pitches , all hittable as hell . Luque thought sadly of the long , lonely drive back to Havana , made especially unbearable by the fact that he had blown his radio on the trip out . <p> " I 'm ready now , " said Fidel . " Spot the glove . " <p> Luque set his mitt low above the outside edge of the towel . Same windup , same easy delivery , but the ball came in low , humming and rising ; it stung the mitt . Big league fastball . Ten more , thrown to spots Luque designated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the leverage of a pitching mound . In his long career , Luque had never thrown a ball as fast ; it was n't necessary , as he was a masterful curveball pitcher . " Break some off , " he shouted . <p> " I 've got two kinds , " Fidel warned . <p> " Do n't worry , I 'll manage . " Luque laughed in Angel 's direction . <p> Fidel signaled a roundhouse with the cock of his wrist . Same easy windup and delivery . The ball started to drift inside but bent back across the plate  --  a patented Dolph Luque curve . Another and another and another . Not a doubt in the world the kid could pitch for the Giants next week . Fidel signaled his drop . Luque smiled . Fidel 's drop looked like a fastball until it broke and bit down just in front of the towel . The ball skipped in the dirt and came up under Luque 's glove , striking him firmly in the balls . Luque went down in a heap , clutching himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at the Castro dinner table , Luque tried to persuade Angel Castro to sign a contract with the Giants in the boy 's name . Luque made financial promises he knew the team would not honor in order to secure a signature . To no avail . " My son will go to university , " Angel said . " He will be a lawyer . " Luque left the next morning on the silent 350-mile trek back to Havana . <p> The following year , while at the University of Havana , Fidel was Luque 's guest at a game between the visiting Giants and a Cuban all-star team . After the game Fidel and some college friends got a little high and visited a tattoo parlor on the waterfront . Instead of choosing a baseball with the name of a Cuban team , Fidel substituted " N.Y . Giants . " <p> Rayty says , " Why did n't you tell me ? There are herbs and oils of Eleggua and Babalu , ceremonies to remove tattoos . Shame , Fidelito . " <p> " They would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a believer . " <p> " Are you a believer in Barcelona razor beams " <p> " Laser . In Barcelona you do n't have to be a believer . You only have to pay the bill . " <p> Ratty examines the spot where he still sees  --  or believes he sees  --  the old baseball . " If you do not believe , it is certain to return . " Ratty circles the bar of hard fat on the moist shoulder under the pressure of both palms . He has mounted the desk and Fidel as well , moving the fat over the body hair , leaving it glistening and flat against the skin like cattails blown over by a storm . <p> He hums an extemporary song the Oriente praise-singers call <p> toast . Fidel knows he is being humored but does n't mind . There 's satisfaction in the kneading of weary muscle and lifeless flesh , in the gliding pressure on nerve and bone . <p> Ratty works down Fidel 's spine but stops abruptly at his belt . " What 's this ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugs a wide elasticized band out of Fidel 's pants . " Another Barcelona " <p> " A support . For my back . " <p> " For your back ... for your stomach . Shame on you . Take it off . " <p> Fidel unbuckles the girdle . Ratty pulls it out from the rear and tosses it on the chair . He begins to rub the lower back with his bear fat , down the spine to the coccyx , the rounded jelly of the gluteus . Fidel 's pleasure is extraordinary , which pleases the masseur immensely . In rhythm to Ratty 's effort , Fidel moans . <p> Ratty starts humming his toast again as he throws his entire body into the massage . Fidel grunts when Ratty has hit just the right spot ; it is an electric release of tension , a storing of new energy . The lamp throws deformed shadows on the far wall . <p> Ratty 's song is an elaborate weaving of melodic strands that take unexpected turns ; it is almost Arabic-sounding in the manner of flamenco . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his people and they Proclaimed him their savior .... <p> Manguin hums and slaps an accompaniment on his subject 's flesh . He sings louder : This Fidel , Fidelito , he has magical powers , Powers to revolutionize himself and the future ; / No traps can hold him , no armies control him , this wondrous bear-walking man .... <p> He likes the stanza so well he repeats it , and he also has time to invent the next lines : Fidel , Fidelito , he 's a cagey old bear now , with scars on his body and scars on his heart ; / They want to take his teeth , his beard , his claws  --  ha , they do n't know where to start .... <p> Ratty stops rubbing and sings to the ceiling , They do n't know Fidelito , he is no trained Russian bear , the wildness in him can not be erased ; / Like the marks on his shoulder , his revenge has another hiding place .... Ratty says , " You like that one ? " <p> Fidel grunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires and floods , bring quake and starvation , Fidel knows well of these ; / The bear and the rat wo n't go weak in the knees . And Havana will not tumble into the seas .... <p> " These are true toasts , eh , Fidel ? " Fidel , beginning to drowse , hears the whistle again . He becomes alert and sits up , almost knocking Ratty off the desk . Ratty dabs at the fat on Fidel 's back with a towel while they both look to the balcony . Glowing embers tumble into the Caribbean . " See . I told you . Wait , there will be more . " <p> " I believe you , Fidelito . I believe ... " <p> There is a soft double knock . Ratty stares at the door . The knock again , more firmly . Fidel propels Ratty toward the door with a stern glance . Ratty Manguin limps over . <p> A lieutenant snaps to attention ; two of his men hold a civilian by the arms . " We caught this one . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one with the pamphlets . " From the desk , Fidel cocks his head : " With anyone ? " <p> " Alone , sir . " <p> " What was he doing ? " <p> " In a large closet , he was burning papers . " The lieutenant snaps his fingers , and a guard hands him a sheaf of pages-the ones on top are charred . The officer offers them to Fidel . " We 'll go back and look carefully for further evidence , sir . " <p> The guards deposit a slim man inside the door . The lieutenant salutes Fidel . <p> Fidel says , " Nicely done . " <p> " Thank you , sir . " He salutes again , and the guardia leave . <p> Ratty closes the door and says , waving his bear fat under the prisoner 's nose , " Do n't deny anything , freak . " <p> The terrified prisoner does not , can not , respond . Here is Fidel Castro lying across a desk with his back greased . <p> Fidel glances at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The high tremolo in the man 's voice garbles his words . <p> " You be silent , " Ratty snaps . <p> Fidel looks at the second page , then the next and the next . The typed words are blurred , but Fidel does not want to put on his reading glasses . He can see well enough to know that the poetry is extremely erotic and lacking in rhyme . " Hmmm . It is not Marti . " Ratty Manguin glares at the accused . Fidel reads on in silence . " It 's modern crap , Emiliano . Smut and obscenities , filthy pornography . You are not the most sentimental of artists , Senor . " Fidel snaps his fingers . " Shirt , Emiliano . " <p> Ratty runs to fetch the fatigue shirt . He wipes Fidel 's back clean and helps him put on his shirt , buttoning it and pulling it taut in the front . As Ratty buckles the belt , Fidel says , " Step into the light . " <p> The slim figure comes forward . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks . The eyes are frightened . He wears rimless glasses . <p> Fidel says , turning to another poem , " These are not signed . " <p> " Valdevon . The family name is Valdevon . Diego . " The voice is less high-pitched now . <p> " Valdevon . There was a law professor . At the university . Many years ago . A remarkable man , legendary . " <p> " My grandfather . " <p> Ratty is on a stomping run across the room ; he leaps with outstretched hands at the man 's face . He screams . " Must say sir . " <p> The man can not fully ward off the attack , and his glasses are knocked to the floor . Ratty stomps on them with his boot heel . A blood scratch creases the man 's cheek . <p> Fidel barks , " Ratty , no . " The dwarf backs away with a snarl . <p> Valdevon kneels and examines the wreck of his glasses . <p> Ratty 's interruption upsets Fidel , who believes he can read the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Valdevon 's pupils , which quiver and look distractedly at Manguin . A missed opportunity . Uncertainty for Fidel . <p> " So tell me , why were you hiding yourself in a basement ? " <p> " Hiding ? I was n't hiding . Sir . I have a place down there , a bed , a desk . It is not a closet . It is where I live . " <p> " Cubans do not have to live in closets . " <p> " Anyone will tell you I live there . " <p> " A place to write sedition against the government " <p> " No . Sir . " <p> " A place to write pornography ? " <p> " Not pornography . Sir . " <p> " Then what ? " <p> " I would say romantic . Sir . " <p> " In either case , decadent . " He throws the pages on his desk . " Your father , he is what , also a poet ? " <p> " He 's a lawyer . For the State Trade Committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must say sir .... " <p> " A lawyer . Sir . He has disavowed me . " <p> " The important question is , have you disavowed him " <p> " No . He is a good man . I am his disappointment . " <p> " Because you are a homosexual ? " <p> Valdevon furrows a brow and tilts his head . " Because I am not a lawyer . " Ratty raises his arm in threat . " Sir . " <p> " No . Because you are not a useful member of this society . In the Sierra Maestra , the men would have flayed your skin . " <p> " In the Sierra Maestra , I 'd have fought with the others . " Valdevon looks as fierce as his gentle features will allow . <p> Ratty Manguin spits in Diego Valdevon 's face . Valdevon lets the spittle run down his cheek . He stares in noncomprehension . <p> " Well , Valdevon , how can we determine if you are a traitor or just a pornographer Tell me . " <p> Valdevon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am neither . " <p> " When we were in the mountains and caught someone who might have betrayed us , you know what we did Captain Manguin here would take an empty glass and urinate in it . We would tell the traitor that to prove his innocence he must drink it . If he was willing , we could be certain that ... " Fidel waves his arms . " Get the guards , Emiliano . " <p> Fidel says to the entering lieutenant , " Get the truth out of him . " These are murderous words , uttered wearily . " Then contact the father . He may want to claim this degeneration of his loins . " <p> The guards handle Valdevon roughly . The one in charge prods him with a short club . <p> In the silence again , Ratty sings , So bring on your worst , bring your fires and hood , bring quake and starvation .... Fidelito knows these well .... <p> " Go up to bed , Ratty . " <p> " Fidelito ... I have some curative water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bed . " Fidel points . <p> Alone in the gloom , Fidel walks to the closet near the hallway and opens the door to reveal a broad full-length mirror . Fidel considers himself . He pulls in his stomach , squares his shoulders . He covers his beard with his hand and considers . He unbuttons his shirt and drops it to the floor . He sees the not-so-awful body of a sixty-seven-year-old man . Something could be done . <p> He backs away from the mirror , imagining he is stepping over irregular ground littered with broken cane stalks . Near the far wall he stops and sees himself , vague and distant . He sees more clearly what is not there  --  a catcher , an older man in a white shirt and brown slacks , spotting a rounded mitt on the outside edge of the towel . Two dark fingers wiggle the sign for the big curve . <p> Fidel , astride the pitching rubber , right hand behind his back clutching nothing across the seams , leans forward , peering in . He shakes his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simultaneously takes the first step and arm-swing of his windup . He watches his movements carefully : they must be as graceful as they used to be . In the mirror he is in a white uniform , an orange-and-black " N.Y . " on his cap and over his heart . The mound is elevated . Batter , catcher , and umpire await the pitch . The crowd is silent . <p> His knee comes up sharp as a knife blade and swings forward in harmony with the pivot of his hips . He feels his rhythm , his power building . This will be the fastest pitch he has ever thrown . There is a momentary flash of doubt that he can control it . <p>
