Section : Through a Chemist 's Eyes <p> We all have alcohol in our body in small amounts , and it has no effect because there is so little of it . When we suddenly increase the amount , by drinking a lot of it , then we experience some rather unusual effects  --  elation , to begin with , but deflation a few hours later . Were alcohol to be discovered today its sale to the public would never be permitted because of its potentially lethal side-effects . <p> There are people in the world , such as Muslims and Mormons , for whom alcohol is taboo . There are those who suspect alcoholic drinks of harboring unwanted chemicals , and they claim that brewers , vintners , and distillers use additives to improve the color , the clarity , and the keeping quality of their drinks . Yet for every person who opposes the demon drink there is an ardent supporter of alcohol . <p> It is rare to find such a collection of emotions , warnings , hazards , and benefits surrounding a simple molecule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we balance its advantages against its disadvantages ? The answer to these questions is to be found in a closer look at its chemistry . <p> Alcohol is also called ethyl alcohol or ethanol , which is the correct chemical name for this molecule . There are two ways in which alcohol is produced on a large scale : by the fermentation of sugars , or by the chemical reaction of water and ethylene . The former is agriculturally derived alcohol ; the latter is often referred to as industrial alcohol . Although they are chemically identical , agriculturally derived alcohol is classed as drinkable , while industrial alcohol is made undrinkable by adding unpleasant chemicals . It is then popularly referred to as methylated spirits or meths for short . <p> The alcohol made by the fermentation of agricultural products is produced by the activity of fungi called yeasts . These grow by feeding on sugars , such as glucose , and as they do this they make alcohol , which for them is an unwanted by-product . <p> We can analyze the contents of an alcoholic brew and find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . For instance , a liter ( about two of the traditional pints* ) of the world-famous Irish drink , Guinness , in addition to providing you with 370 calories of energy , contains the following : TABLE <p> Clearly Guinness is also a good source of some essential minerals , and if we drink it regularly it will provide a significant fraction of our daily requirements of the B vitamins . The surprise of drinks such as Guinness is the large amount of potassium compared to sodium , and this is true of all beers . Most foods have much more sodium than potassium. a How It Affects the Body <p> Despite these dietary components , an alcoholic drink is not regarded as a food , a medicine , or a tonic , although in earlier times alcohol was advertised as all of these . Today we treat it mainly as a relaxant . Our body treats it as a poison . There are many ethical questions that alcohol raises which a knowledge of its chemistry can not answer , but we can answer two key questions . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a few hours later make us feel so bad ? Why do many people , such as women , native Americans , and Japanese , have to take special care because their tolerance of alcohol is low ? <p> Alcohol does not occur as part of the complex chemistry going on inside the cells of the human body , but a little alcohol is produced naturally within our intestines by bacteria and yeasts which have enzymes that can turn carbohydrate into alcohol , and this alcohol gets into our bloodstream . Our liver has an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH ) which gets rid of this unwanted chemical and converts the alcohol to acetaldehyde . This molecule is then turned into acetic acid by another enzyme , and the acetic acid is used in the so-called Krebs cycle of chemical reactions , by which its energy is extracted and it emerges as carbon dioxide . <p> The liver can deal with large amounts of alcohol , but it needs time to do so . If a person takes in too much alcohol at one session he may even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 400 ml , the amount of alcohol in a liter bottle of spirits . A normal liver can process process 12 ml ( 10 grams ) of alcohol per hour . A glass of wine , which is about 12% alcohol , may provide this amount , as will half a pint of beer which is around 4% alcohol , and so will a tot , or shot , of spirits which is generally 40% alcohol . These measures are only rough guides because the amount of alcohol in wine , beer , and spirits can vary within quite wide margins . The quantity commonly referred to by those who give advice about drinking is the " unit , " which is generally that quantity of a drink which will deliver 10 grams of alcohol . It is not a precise amount , only a guide , since it varies widely even among drinks of apparently the same type . <p> The effects of drinking alcohol can be seen in the table below . This table can not take into account all factors which determine the effect that alcohol will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the condition of the liver , and whether the alcohol is taken with a meal . <p> Alcohol starts to be absorbed the minute it enters our mouths , but most is absorbed from the stomach and the gut . Ten percent of the alcohol we take in is lost from our body without being digested . It is exhaled on our breath , sweated through our pores , or passed out in our urine . The other 90% is processed by the liver . The two chemicals which most affect our bodies when we drink are alcohol itself and acetaldehyde , which affect different organs in different ways : <p> Brain and Central Nervous System . Alcohol makes us feel happier , more at ease with people , and less inhibited about what we say and do . Technically alcohol is referred to as a depressant , but this does not mean that it makes us depressed . It means that it slows down the activity of the central nervous system so that messages take longer to travel along nerve fibers . We become more relaxed and overconfident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our speech becomes slurred . Alcohol has this effect on the brain because it replaces water molecules around nerve cells , and this interferes with the movement of electrically charged atoms which are responsible for transmitting information along a nerve fiber . Alcohol also slows the movement of chemical messenger molecules which carry information from cell to cell . <p> Ears . These are the organs which give us our sense of balance . Alcohol changes the density of the tissue and fluid in the ear , and the more alcohol we take the bigger are the changes , until we lose our normal sense of balance . The result is that we sway and stagger , trying to compensate for the feeling that we are about to fall over . <p> Skin . Here it is the acetaldehyde which has an effect , dilating the blood vessels and making us feel hot . The dilation of blood vessels in the scalp and around the brain results eventually in a bad headache . Alcohol raises our pulse and blood pressure which increase the sensation of warmth . We can achieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold day , but the comforting idea that people dying from exposure in the snow can be saved by a drink of brandy ( carried by a St. Bernard dog , of course ) , is a myth . In fact , the alcohol would only serve to increase the loss of heat from their bodies . <p> Stomach . Men digest alcohol more quickly than women because they have more ADH in their stomachs and ADH converts alcohol to acetaldehyde . Consequently men can tolerate more alcohol than can women , because drink-for-drink , less alcohol gets into a man 's blood stream from his stomach . Native Americans and Japanese have the same lower level of ADH as women . The male and female kidneys dispose of alcohol at the same rate , so that is not the reason for the difference between the sexes . Tests in the United States showed that when both men and women were given the same amount of alcohol by injection into their bloodstream there were no sex-related differences in behavior . <p> Liver . This is the main organ for removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . Indeed , people have been known to fail breathalyzer tests 24 hours after their last drink . Alcohol also stimulates the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver , depleting the body 's immediate store of energy . Although alcohol is high in calories it does not satisfy your desire for food  --  indeed , it seems to stimulate it . <p> Kidneys . If you drink 250 ml of wine ( about two glasses ) you will lose at least 500 ml of water from your body as urine during the next two hours . Normally our kidneys will reabsorb and reuse water and are prompted to do so by a hormone called vasopressin , which is released by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain . Alcohol reduces the amount of vasopressin , and so the kidneys fail to recycle water , which then passes to the bladder and out of the body . The result is dehydration unless this fluid loss is replaced . <p> All these effects are the results of an immediate toxic reaction to alcohol . There are also long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impaired brain function and memory . Excess alcohol can lead to acute inflammation of the stomach , especially by the acetaldehyde formed , which is why for men one effect of alcohol can be a stomach ulcer . How Alcoholic Drinks Are Made <p> Alcoholic drinks come in a large number of guises , but the main ones are beers , wines , and spirits . What distinguishes the last of these from the other two is the chemical process of distillation which concentrates and purifies the alcohol . Concentrating alcohol this way led to a whole new range of drinks . <p> Grapes , barley , corn , sugar cane , fruit , potatoes , and rice are all used to make alcoholic drinks . When the crop is harvested and the sugars of the carbohydrate component are released , they may be fermented into alcohol by acting as food for yeast . Yeast uses simple sugars in much the same way we do  --  as a source of energy  --  but unlike humans , who generate their energy with the help of oxygen from the air , the yeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the product is alcohol . <p> Any source of sugary solution can be fermented , and in many countries there are drinks produced from a wide variety of fruit sugars . For example , in the United Kingdom , there is a large industry fermenting apple juice to make cider , and pear juice to make perry . There is even a cottage industry of homemade wine using soft fruit and wayside berries , such as blackberries and elder-berries . Such fermented juice can be improved by adding ordinary sugar and the final strength of the drink may be as high as 13% alcohol . <p> Wine . Wine can be made simply by crushing grapes , squeezing out the juice and allowing it to ferment with the wild yeasts that are naturally present . This can be a hit-and-miss affair and does not always produce the desired result . It is better to add the right yeast to the grape juice , but even doing this does not always stop millions of liters of wine going to waste because rogue yeasts have outpaced the starter yeast which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kill the commercial starter yeasts . <p> Not all wild yeasts are bad ; some impart a new flavor to the wine and are cultured and added to the crushed grape . Winemakers jealously guard their strains of yeast . The preferred yeast for wine is Saccharomyces ellipsoideus , and unwanted bacteria are kept down by using sulphur dioxide , which is added as its solution in water or as sodium sulfite which dissolves in water and forms sulfur dioxide . In earlier times " sulfiting " was done simply by burning sulfur near the vat of grape juice . <p> There are thousands of wines which divide first into red , white , and rose , then into region . White wines are made from grape juice which has been separated from the grape skins . Red wine is fermented with the skins , and their color chemicals are extracted into the alcohol solution . This also extracts tannins and other compounds which add flavor and help the wine to keep better . The red dye compounds from the skins can be extracted more quickly by heating to 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and red grapes . <p> The amount of alcohol in wines can vary between 5% and 13% , which is about the maximum concentration that a yeast can survive . Most have about 10% to 12% . If the content exceeds 13% , the product must include added alcohol , and these are called fortified wines , of which the best known are sherry , vermouth , and port with about 15% alcohol . These also have added sugar ( vermouths have added herbs as well ) , and they are left to stand in casks , from the wood of which they extract more chemicals . <p> Beer . All that was needed to discover wine was to crush the grapes to release the juice , and the wild yeast spores on the skins would do the fermenting . On the other hand , brewing beer is such a complex process that John Postgate in his book Microbes and Man says that it is a wonder that it was ever discovered . Yet the first written accounts of beer date from the Egypt of the 1st Dynasty , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Babylonians are thought to have brewed ale , rather than beer ( which requires hops to be added to make it bitter ) . It is rather remarkable that ale was first brewed 6,000 years ago when we consider the chemistry involved . Ale is produced from fermented barley , yet the starch in cereal grains can not be fermented by yeasts , which need simple sugars to work on . The first step in brewing ale is to steep the barley in water for a day or two and then leave it in a warm , damp room for a few more days so that it will germinate . This process is called malting . The grain sprouts develop enzymes which break down the starch into simple sugars . The malted barley is next heated to stop the sprouting and steeped in water to soak out the sugars and other plant chemicals on which the yeast can grow . The resulting solution is sieved and called " wort . " <p> To make beer the wort is then boiled with hops , which imparts flavor and releases preservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beer . Finally , the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is put in , and the whole lot is allowed to ferment for a week or so . As the yeast multiplies it produces not only alcohol but also a whole cocktail of organic molecules which give the beer its flavor . When the fermentation is over , the brew is processed to remove sediment , clarified , and packaged for distribution . <p> There are hundreds of brands of beer , although only a few types , which divide roughly into top fermented beers , such as the traditional mild , bitter , pale ale , and stout , and the bottom-fermented beers , such as pilsner and lager . Ale is made by fermenting malted barley wort with a top-floating yeast which can not ferment all the malt sugars and which works best at a temperature above 50 degrees F. Lager is made from less strongly malted barley and is fermented with a yeast ( Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ) which works at the bottom of the wort , and which can ferment all the malt sugars . This yeast will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " beers and lagers have been allowed to ferment until all the sugars are turned to alcohol . Their name is misleading because they are only slightly less calorific than normal beers and lagers . <p> Spirits . To make drinks with a high level of alcohol it is necessary to use a still . Distillation was discovered by the ancient Romans over 2,000 years ago , and brought to a fine art by the monks of the Middle Ages . Distilling wine drives off the alcohol , and when the vapors , or " spirits , " are cooled and collected you have a product which is mainly alcohol . In fact , methanol distills off first because this boils at 149 degrees F , and should be discarded , then the alcohol comes off , boiling at 172 degrees F. The vapor that condenses from a still also contains a lot of water , but a second and maybe a third distillation will reduce this until we collect almost pure alcohol . Distillation alone can not remove the last traces of water because water and alcohol form a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain composition is reached . This composition is about 95% ethanol , 5% water . To get absolutely pure alcohol , ways other than distillation are needed to remove the water , but such alcohol is never required for making drinks . <p> Through the centuries distilled alcohol has been a part of the medical pharmacopeia . The first distilled alcohol was known as aqua vita , or water of life , and was valued for its restorative properties . Spirits were also used by surgeons as an early form of anesthetic and to clean wounds . Alcohol was used to wipe the skin before injections because it is a good antiseptic when pure . For the same reason it is also a good preservative . <p> What distinguishes the different kinds of spirits are the tiny amounts of other volatiles which distill with the alcohol . In this way , we have brandy ( which comes from wine ) , whisky ( which , like beer , is made from fermented barley ) , rum ( from fermented molasses ) , and bourbon ( from fermented corn ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purest drink of all because it is passed through a charcoal filter to remove everything except the alcohol . This is why it is almost tasteless . <p> Gin is made from fermented grain alcohol and flavored by a second and even third distillation from a blend of herbs , fruits , and berries . These so-called botanicals are a secret blend of up to ten fruits , herbs , and spices which must include juniper , this being the essential component which identifies a drink as gin . Other botanicals may be coriander , angelica , orris root , almonds , cassia bark , licorice , orange and lemon peel , cardamom , cinnamon , and nutmeg . The Risks and Benefits <p> Alcohol can do serious harm to the human body . The health risks that a heavy drinker faces are broken bones , obesity , addiction , ulcers , cirrhosis of the liver , brain damage , a particularly nasty form of heart disease called cardiomyopathy , and possibly even cancer of the esophagus . The effects on the liver are complex and still not clearly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are chemicals necessary to the action of enzymes . The outcome is that the oxidation of fatty acids is impaired in the mitochondria , the structures in the cells that produce energy , and more fats are synthesized . These fats accumulate in the liver to produce what is known as fatty liver , a symptom of alcoholism . Cirrhosis of the liver is a condition exacerbated by the long-term abuse of alcohol . It was once thought to be caused by it , but this seems unlikely . Cirrhosis was seen as a toxic response in which normal tissue is replaced by collagen ( fibrous tissue ) . As a consequence the liver functions less efficiently . <p> Alcohol can be regarded as a form of food . A unit of alcohol ( 10 grams ) provides us with about 70 calories of energy . The recommended maximum intake for a man is 21 units of alcohol a week , and this will provide about 1,400 calories of his energy intake . For a woman the recommended amount is 14 units of alcohol , which will provide around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless must be taken into account when planning a diet . Alcohol accounts for about 10% of the food intake of adults in the United States and Europe . It was once considered such a convenient way of providing energy that it used to be added to intravenous drips as a supplement . <p> As a food , alcohol has some disadvantages . It can not supply energy in the same way as carbohydrates , so it does little to help us work or exercise , but it can supply excess calories that lead to weight gain and can be a very expensive form of food . A pint of beer will provide between 140 and 210 calories depending on whether it is mild , bitter , keg , lager , or stout . Draught mild has the fewest calories while stouts have the most . The calorie content of wines and ciders depends also on the sugars they contain , and that can be judged on whether they are labeled sweet , medium , or dry . Four fluid ounces of wine ( a normal glass ) will be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes no difference whether the wine is red or white . A glass of sherry is about 50 ml and provides between 55 ( dry ) and 65 ( sweet ) calories . A single measure of spirits or liqueur is about 25 ml ( a sixth of a gill ) and provides between 50 and 75 calories . Whisky and gin are about 50 ; liqueurs such as cherry brandy and Cointreau are nearer 75 . <p> Alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine also provide other dietary nutrients , but spirits and other distilled drinks lack these . A pint of beer contains about 50 mg of calcium and 0.1 mg of iron , while a glass of wine has only about 10 mg of calcium but up to 1 mg of iron . Cider has almost 3 mg of iron per pint . Beer is also a source of the B vitamins , although wines have less of them . These vitamins come from the yeast . No alcoholic drink provides vitamins A , C , or D. <p> The benefits of alcohol are varied . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass of beer , or a shot of whisky , to help get off to sleep . However , it may not be a good night 's sleep , because alcohol appears to deprive us of a key type of sleep , the early sleep in which we dream . Continued loss of this essential sleep may be the reason why very heavy drinkers eventually suffer the hallucinations traditionally known as the " DTs " ( delirium tremens ) , although these are more likely to strike as part of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal . <p> Moderate drinkers , those who take two or three units of alcohol a day , suffer less coronary heart disease and have lower cholesterol levels . Drink may be beneficial for the heart but only in moderation . Men who drink more than the equivalent of six pints of beer a day ( 12 units ) are twice as likely to suffer a sudden heart attack as non-drinkers , according to Professor Gerry Shaper of the Royal Free Hospital in London who carried out an eight-year study of over 7,500 middle-aged men . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were heavy drinkers . <p> Studies of the life style of French farmers supports drinking as beneficial , as revealed in the leading medical journal Lancet in 1992 . Dr. Serge Renaud of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Lyons , France , believes that French farmers are less prone to coronary heart disease , despite a diet rich in animal fats , because of their relatively high consumption of alcohol in the form of red wine . Two glasses a day is the recommended amount . Red wine is not a medicine , and it will not cure or relieve heart problems that are already present . If there is any value in drinking red wine , it lies in its ability to prevent heart disease . This message of the benefits of red wine increased sales by over 44% in the United States when it was announced in 1992 . A group at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland , California , claimed that drinkers of white wine were also less likely to suffer coronary heart disease . Whether it is the alcohol itself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of debate . The antioxidant behavior of the phenolics may slow down plaque formation from low-density lipoproteins  --  the " bad " form of cholesterol . <p> Not only do drinkers appear to have lower cholesterol levels and have less coronary heart disease , but they also get fewer colds . That was the conclusion of the final research project carried out by the now-defunct Common Cold Unit at Salisbury , England . Not every common cold virus we catch leads to a cold . Between four and ten viruses infect us every year , but only half of these end up as bad colds  --  for the rest we either have existing antibodies against the virus , or we can shake it off easily . Nor can you stop a cold with the popular cure of hot whisky and lemon ; all this does is to make the misery a bit more bearable . <p> However it Works its magic , alcohol certainly seems to reward many of its moderate users : those who drink two units of alcohol a day catch half the number of colds that non-drinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking cancels out the protection against colds which comes with drinking . <p> * Many drink measures in this article are according to Imperial measure , which is slightly different from American . For instance , a pint is 20 oz. and a gill is 4 oz . <p> a We often redress the balance when drinking by eating salted snacks . TABLE On the average man . For a woman the same effects may be experienced with about two-thirds the amount of alcohol that a man needs , assuming they are the same weight . Imperial pint equal to 20 oz . Sold in 700 ml bottle . The Morning After and How to Avoid It <p> Once alcohol is absorbed by our bodies we have its effects to contend with , and later those of its byproduct acetaldehyde . As the alcohol disappears we sober up , but as the acetaldehyde forms we begin to experience its effects as a hangover . Sobering up is possible in theory by boosting the amount of ADH . Achieving this is another matter , but you can not sober up by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous exercise , drinking black coffee , or putting your head under the cold tap . <p> The morning after a bout of heavy drinking is simply the slow process of waiting for the acetaldehyde to disappear , but there are a few tips for coping with hangovers . No successful hangover cure has yet been marketed , and we know why this is unlikely to work for chemical reasons , unless it can speed up the removal of the excess acetaldehyde from the body . The following suggestions may relieve the worst excesses of a hangover : Have a glass of milk before you start drinking so you are not drinking on an empty stomach . Stick to one type of alcoholic drink , and occasionally have a soft drink . Drink a pint of water before going to bed . For breakfast eat something sweet , such as honey or jam . This is because these foods contain a lot of fructose . This sugar generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) which is involved in the processing of alcohol . Extra sugar will also prevent depletion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port , sherry , and red wines . However , the link between color and hangover is not always a good guide . Whisky sometimes gets its dark color from added caramel , and so does rum . But the reds of wines come from chemicals in the skins of grapes , and these may be partly responsible for a hangover . <p> The traditional remedy for a hangover is to resort to the hair of the dog that bit you and have another drink . This will only be of relief if you are addicted to alcohol , so that the unpleasant effects of your hangover are mainly withdrawal symptoms . Otherwise , it is rather foolish advice . <p> By John Emsley , Ph.D <p> <p> Dr. Emsley is science writer in residence at Imperial College , London .
