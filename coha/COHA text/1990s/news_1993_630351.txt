<p> Would a more lucrative contract offer have kept Michael Jordan from retiring ? <p> Would it have delayed his retirement a year or enticed him to play the last three years on his contract plus a bonus year for , say , $ 50 or $ 60 million ? <p> We 'll never know for sure , but insiders close to Jordan say there was a good chance Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf could have kept Jordan around longer by following the lead of fellow owners who are offering their stars big balloon payments to make up for years of being paid under scale . <p> Sources say Jordan would never publicly admit he was upset about being underpaid , but it obviously helped contribute to his decision to retire . Granted , it was n't the only thing , but the absence of a bigger contract bothered him . <p> The source also said it was a factor in diminishing his desire to play . <p> On the record , Jordan always maintained he played for fun , not money . He repeated these words during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than honest . He did n't want to fuss in public over his future market value . <p> Two years ago , Jordan agreed with the majority opinion that , purely in terms of his Bulls ' salary , he was being underpaid " according to league standards . " <p> When told that Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss had given a $ 14.5 million balloon payment to Magic Johnson even after Johnson retired because of the AIDS virus , Jordan said , " I hope Jerry Reinsdorf is watching Buss . " He said it jokingly , but he was serious . <p> Nevertheless , Jordan had said he would never go to Reinsdorf and ask for a raise " because I feel that because I signed on the dotted line for ' X ' amount of dollars over ' X ' number of years , I am obligated to live up to my contract because I am a man of my word . Now , if Jerry offers me a big raise , I 'd be a fool not to accept it . Sure , I 'd accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then I 'm screwed , " Jordan said . <p> It became a matter of pride and principle for Jordan . And it grew increasingly irritating to Jordan as he saw lesser players , including unproven rookies , being given more lucrative deals . <p> " Clearly , Michael Jordan was very underpaid , " said Charles Grantham , the executive director of the NBA Players Association . " If he is recognized as the best player in the league , then he should be compensated accordingly . But how can you even measure how much he was worth , given the profound positive effect he had upon every financial facet of the Bulls and the entire league ? <p> " I do n't know that there is a salary commensurate with what he represented . It 's immeasurable . He 's off the chart . And how can you even approach estimating his value at a time when the free market does n't even operate in this league ? It 's restricted by the salary cap and the way contracts are negotiated . " <p> Before Jordan retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 26 million contract . He would 've been paid $ 4 million . <p> " The contract looked damn good at the time I signed it , " Jordan said . " It was the best in the league at that time . " <p> But standards quickly changed as the league prospered , largely because of Jordan . The Bulls averaged a league-high 18,433 fans on the road  --  an average of 633 more on the road than any other team . <p> " Michael has been magic to our NBA telecasts , " a spokesperson for Turner Sports Network said . " Over the last eight years that we have carried NBA games , the Bulls with Michael Jordan have averaged a 2.5 rating , which equals 1.5 million household viewing their games , compared to our average of 2.15 ( or 1.1 million ) for the rest of the league . I 'm talking about our NBA games on TBS and TNT . That roughly breaks down to a difference of some 400,000 more households watching when Jordan and the Bulls play on our network compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jordan 's contract compared to other players ' . <p> Jordan 's $ 4 million salary for this season put him in a three-way tie with Boston Celtics center Robert Parish and Los Angeles Clippers guard Ron Harper for fifth in the league , but the average annual salary for the remainder of his contract ranked 20th . <p> And this is excluding No. 1 draft pick Chris Webber , whose average salary is expected to be among the highest . <p> Even reserves such as John ( Hot Rod ) Williams and Danny Ferry of the Cleveland Cavaliers , underachieving gypsy Benoit Benjamin of the New Jersey Nets , fading Lakers star James Worthy and inconsistent Clippers center Stanley Roberts have bigger contract balances than Jordan . <p> Critics of Jordan will point to his off-court earnings of nearly $ 35 million . <p> " But that should have nothing to do with my basketball salary , " Jordan has said . " That 's separate . That should not excuse basketball from its responsibility . " <p> Reinsdorf is a man of pride and principle , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always honors his . Reinsdorf knows like everybody else that he could not pay Jordan what he is worth because of the restrictions of the salary cap . <p> Veteran agent George Andrews has suggested that " all the league chip in and pay Jordan maybe $ 100 million because he 's making so much money for everybody . " <p> But in his new book , Rare Air , Jordan makes his strongest statements yet about Reinsdorf when he says , " If the Bulls want to give me $ 50 million , then fine . Give it to me for all those years that I was underpaid . <p> " But do n't ask me to play when I do n't want to play , when I know in my heart it 's ( the desire ) not going to be there when I step onto the court . I 'm not going to be some sideshow so you can make more money . " <p> Jordan has been keenly aware of his value to the league , to the Bulls , to the game and to companies wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why he fought the league over use of his image in advertising . He is a one-man corporation . In case you 're wondering if Reinsdorf offered Jordan a new contract in that long talk the Sunday before Jordan announced his retirement , Jordan 's agent , David Falk , said no . <p> Perhaps it was because Reinsdorf believed it was too late or simply out of order because Jordan 's mind was made up . Still , one wonders what would have happened if a big offer had been made . <p> But with all the money Jordan was making outside basketball , he could afford not to play anymore . @x The Herald ( Sharon , Pennsylvania ) On the howl page of a great American daily , echoes of the Obama economic plan , also known as the Economics of the Magic Wand : Why would anyone be against American taxes being spent on ourselves ; is n't this why we pay taxes ?
