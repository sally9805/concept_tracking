The second of our War of the Worlds stories is the third story in the issue by a columnist . Gregory Benford collaborated with award-winner David Brin in this tale of yet another writer , Jules Verne , and his encounter with the Martians . <p> I commence this account with a prosaic stroll at eventide  --  a saunter down the avenues of la Ville Lumiere , during which the ordinary swiftly gave way to the extraordinary . I was in Paris to consult with my publisher , as well as to visit old companions and partake of the exquisite cuisine , which my provincial home in Amiens can not boast . Though I am now a gentleman of advanced age , nearing my 70th year , I am still quite able to favor the savories , and it remains a treat to survey the lovely demoiselles as they exhibit the latest fashions on the boulevards , enticing smitten young men and breaking their hearts at the same time . <p> I had come to town that day believing  --  as did most others  --  that there still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien terror ravaging southern France finally reached the valley of the Seine . Ile de France would be defended at all costs , we were assured . So it came to pass that , tricked by this false complaisance , I was in the capital the very afternoon that the crisis struck . <p> Paris ! It still shone as the most splendid exemplar of our progressive age  --  all the more so in that troubled hour , as tense anxiety seemed only to add to the city 's loveliness  --  shimmering at night with both gas and electric lights , and humming by day with new electric trams , whose marvelous wires crisscrossed above the avenues like gossamer heralds of a new era . <p> I had begun here long ago as a young attorney , having followed into my father 's profession . Yet that same head of our family had also accepted my urge to strike out on a literary road , in the theater and later down expansive voyages of prose . " Drink your fill of Paris , my son ! " the good man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Devour these wondrous times . Your senses are keen . Share your insights . The world will change because of it . " <p> Without such help and support , would I ever have found within myself the will , the daring , to explore the many pathways of the future , with all their wonders and perils ? Ever since the Martian invasion began , I had found myself reflecting on an extraordinary life filled with such good fortune , especially now that all human luck seemed about to be revoked . Now , with terror looming from the south and west , would it all soon come to nought ? All that I had achieved ? Everything humanity had accomplished , after so many centuries climbing upward from ignorance ? <p> It was in such an uncharacteristically dour mood that I strolled in the company of M. Beauchamp , a gentleman scientist , that pale afternoon less than an hour before I had my first contact with the horrible Martian machines . Naturally , I had been following the eye-witness accounts which first told of plunging fireballs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rock spitting upward , like miniature versions of the outburst at Krakatau . These impacts had soon proved to be far more than mere meteoritic phenomena , since there soon emerged , like insects from a subterranean lair , three-legged beings bearing incredible malevolence toward the life of this planet . Riding gigantic tripod mechanisms , these unwelcome guests soon set forth with one sole purpose in mind  --  destructive conquest ! <p> The ensuing carnage , the raking fire , the sweeping flames  --  none of these horrors had yet reached the fair country above the river Loire . . . not yet . But reports all too vividly told of villages trampled , farmlands seared black , and hordes of refugees cut down as they fled . <p> Invasion . The word came to mind all too easily remembered . We of northern France knew the pain just twenty-eight years back , when Sedan fell and this sweet land trembled under an attacker 's boot . Several Paris quarters still bear scars where Prussian firing squads tore moonlike craters out of plaster walls , mingling there the ochre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now Paris trembled before advancing powers so malign that , in contrast , those Prussians of 1870 were like beloved cousins , welcome to town for a picnic ! <p> All of this I pondered while taking leave , with Beauchamp , of the Ecole Militaire , the national military academy , where a briefing had just been given to assembled dignitaries , such as ourselves . From the stone portico we gazed toward the Seine , past the encampment of the Seventeenth Corps of Volunteers , their tents arrayed across trampled grass and smashed flower beds of the ironically named Champ-de-Mars . The meadow of the god of war . <p> Towering over this scene of intense ( and ultimately futile ) martial activity stood the tower of M. Eiffel , built for the recent exhibition , that marvelously fashioned testimonial to metal and ingenuity . . . and also target of so much vitriol . <p> " The public 's regard for it may improve with time , " I ventured , observing that Beauchamp 's gaze lay fixed on the same magnificent spire . <p> My companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An eyesore , of no enduring value , " he countered , and for some time we distracted ourselves from more somber thoughts by arguing the relative merits of Eiffel 's work , while turning east to walk toward the Sorbonne . Of late , experiments in the transmission of radio-tension waves had wrought unexpected pragmatic benefits , using the great tower as an antenna . I wagered Beauchamp there would be other advantages , in time . <p> Alas , even this topic proved no lasting diversion from thoughts of danger to the south . Fresh in our minds were reports from the wine districts . The latest outrage  --  that the home of Vouvray was now smashed , trampled and burning . This was my favorite of all the crisp , light vintages  --  better , even , than a fresh Sancerre . Somehow , that loss seemed to strike home more vividly than dry casualty counts , already climbing to the millions . <p> " There must be a method ! " I proclaimed , as we approached the domed brilliance of Les Invalides . " There has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The military is surely doing its best , " Beauchamp said . <p> " Buffoons ! " <p> " But you heard of their losses . The regimants and divisions decimated  --  " Beauchamp stuttered . " The army dies for France ! For humanity  --  of which France is surely the best example . " <p> I turned to face him , aware of an acute paradox  --  that the greatest martial mind of all time lay entombed in the domed citadel nearby . Yet even he would have been helpless before a power that was not of this world . <p> " I do not condemn the army 's courage , " I assured . <p> " Then how can you speak  --  " <p> " No no ! I condemn their lack of imagination ! " <p> " To defeat the incredible takes  --  " <p> " Vision ! " <p> Timidly , for he knew my views , he advanced , " I saw in the Match that the British have consulted with the fantasist , Mr. Wells . " <p> To this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them no aid , only imaginings . " <p> " But you just said  --  " <p> " Vision is not the same as dreaming . " <p> At that moment the cutting smell of sulfuric acid waited on a breeze from the reducing works near the river . ( Even in the most beautiful of cities , rode work has its place . ) Beauchamp mistook my expression of disgust for commentary upon the Englishman , Wells . <p> " He is quite successful . Many compare him to you . " <p> " An unhappy analogy . His stories do not repose on a scientific basis . I make use of physics . He invents . " <p> " In this crisis  --  " <p> " I go to the moon in a cannon ball . He goes in an airship , which he constructs of a metal which does away with the law of gravitation . Ca c'est tres joli !  --  but show me this metal . Let him produce it ! " <p> Beauchamp blinked . " I quite agree  --  but , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand  --  defending ourselves against monstrous invaders ? " <p> We resumed our walk . Leaving behind the crowds paying homage at Napoleon 's Tomb , we made good progress along rue de Varenne , with the Petite Palais now visible across the river , just ahead . <p> " We lag technologically behind these foul beings , that I grant . But only by perhaps a century or two . " <p> " Oh surely , more than that ! To fly between the worlds  --  " <p> " Can be accomplished several ways , all within our comprehension , if not our grasp . " <p> " What of the reports by astronomers of great explosions , seen earlier this year on the surface of the distant roddy planet ? They now think these were signs of the Martian invasion fleet being launched . Surely we could not expend such forces ! " <p> I waved away his objection . " Those are nothing more than I have already foreseen in From the Earth to the Moon . which I would remind you I published thirty-three years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You think the observers witnessed the belching of great Martian cannon ? " <p> " Of course ! I had to make adjustments , engineering alterations , while designing my moon vessel . The shell could not be of steel , like one of Eiffel 's bridges . So I conjectured that the means of making light projectiles of aluminum will come to pass . These are not basic limitations , you see  --  " I waved them away  --  " but mere details . " <p> The wind had shifted , and with relief I now drew in a heady breath redolent with the smells of cookery rising from the city of cuisine . Garlic , roasting vegetables , the dark aromas of warming meats  --  such a contrast with the terror which advanced on the city , and on our minds . Along rue St. Grenelle , I glanced into one of the innumerable tiny cafes . Worried faces stared moodily at their reflections in the broad zinc bars , stained by spilled absinthe . Wine coursed down anxious throats . Murmurs floated on the fitful air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workhorse of battle , " Beauchamp murmured . <p> " There are other methods , " I allowed . <p> " Your dirigibles ? " <p> " Come come , Beauchamp ! You know well that no air permeates the realm between the worlds . " <p> " Then what methods do they employ to maneuver ? They fall upon Asia , Africa , the Americans , the deserving British  --  all with such control , such intricate planning . " <p> " Rockets ! Though perhaps there are flaws in my original cannon ideas  --  I am aware that passengers would be squashed to jelly by the firing of such a great gun  --  nothing similar condemns the use of cylinders of slowly exploding chemicals . " <p> " To steer between planets ? Such control ! " <p> " Once the concept is grasped , it is but a matter of ingenuity to bring it to pass . Within a century , Beauchamp , we shall see rockets of our own rise from this ponderous planet , into the heavens . I promise you that ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomily . " Not to mention a century . " <p> " To live , we must think . Our thoughts must encompass the entire range of possibility . " <p> I waved my furled umbrella at the sky , sweeping it around and down rue de Rennes , toward the southern eminence of Montparnasse . By chance my gaze followed the pointing tip  --  and so it I was among the first to spy one of the Martian machines , like a monstrous insect , cresting that ill-fated hill . <p> There is something in the human species which abhors oddity , the unnatural . We are double in arms , legs , eyes , ears , even nipples ( if I may venture such an indelicate comparison ; but remember , I am a man of science at all times ) . Two-ness is fundamental to us , except when Nature dictates singularity  --  we have but one mouth , and one organ of regeneration . Such biological matters are fundamental . Thus , the instantaneous feelings horror at first sight of the three-ness of the invaders  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need not explain the revulsion to any denizen of our world . These were alien beings , in the worst sense of the word . <p> " They have broken through ! " I cried . " The front must have collapsed . " <p> Around us crowds now took note of the same dread vision , looming over the sooty Montparnasse railway station . Men began to run , women to wail . Yet , some courageous ones of both sexes ran the other way , to help bolster the city 's slim , final bulwark , a line from which rose vollies of crackling rifle fire . <p> By unspoken assent , Beauchamp and I refrained from joining the general fury . Two old men , wealthier in dignity than physical stamina , we had more to offer with our experience and seasoned minds than with the frail strength of our arms . <p> " Note the rays , " I said dispassionately , as for the first time we witnessed the fearful lashing of that horrid heat , smiting the helpless trains , igniting rail cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was struggling to hold both reason and resolve , fastening upon details as a drowning man might cling to flotsam . <p> " Could they be like Hertzian waves ? " Beauchamp asked in wavering tones . <p> We had been excited by the marvelous German discovery , and its early application to experiments in wireless signaling Still , even I had to blink at Beauchamp 's idea  --  for the first time envisioning the concentration of such waves into searing beams . " Possibly , " I allowed . " Legends say that Archimedes concentrated light to beat back Roman ships , at Syracuse . . . . But the waves Hertz found were meters long , and of less energy than a fly 's wingbeat . These  --  " <p> I jumped , despite my efforts at self control , as another , much larger machine appeared to the west of the first , towering majestically , also spouting bright red torrents of destruction . It set fires on the far southern horizon , the beam playing over city blocks , much as a cat licks a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beauchamp said morosely . <p> " Certainly we do not have much time , " I allowed . " But you put my mind into harness , my friend . " <p> Around us people now openly bolted . Carriages rushed past without regard to panicked figures who dashed across the avenues . Horses clopped madly by , whipped by their masters . I stopped to unroll the paper from a Colombian cigar . Such times demand clear thinking . It was up to the higher minds and classes to display character and resolve . <p> " No , we must seize upon some technology closer to hand , " I said . " Not the Hertzian waves , but perhaps something allied . . . " <p> Beauchamp glanced back at the destructive tripods with lines of worry creasing his brow . " If rifle and cannon prove useless against these marching machines  --  " <p> " Then we must apply another science , not mere mechanics . " <p> " Biology ? There are the followers of Pasteur , of course . " Beauchamp was plainly struggling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Martians  --  has anyone yet seen one ?  --  to drink contaminated milk . . . " <p> I had to chuckle . " Too literal , my friend . Would you serve it to them on a silver plate ? " <p> Beauchamp drew himself up . " I was only attempting  --  " <p> " No matter . The point is now moot . Can you not see where the second machine stands , atop the very site of Pasteur 's now ruined Institute ? " <p> Although biology is a lesser cousin in the family of science , I nevertheless imagined with chagrin those fine collections of bottled specimens , now kicked and scattered under splayed tripod feet , tossing the remnants to the swirling winds . No help there , alas . <p> " Nor are the ideas of the Englishman , Darwin , of much use , for they take thousands of years to have force . No , I have in mind physics , but rather more recent work . " <p> I had been speaking from the airy spot wherein my head makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens when a concept lumbers upward from the mind 's depths , coming , coming . . . <p> Around us lay the most beautiful city in the world , already flickering with gas lamps , lining the prominent avenues . Might that serve as inspiration ? Poison gas ? But no , the Martians had already proved invulnerable to even the foul clouds which the Army tried to deploy . <p> But then what ? I have always believed that the solution to tomorrow 's problems usually lies in plain sight , in materials and concepts already at hand  --  just as the essential ideas for submarines , airships , and even interplanetary craft , have been apparent for decades . The trick lies in formulating the right combinations . <p> As that thought coursed through my mind , a noise erupted so cacophonously as to over-ride even the commotion further south . A rattling roar ( accompanied by the plaint of already-frightened horses ) approached from the opposite direction ! Even as I turned round toward the river , I recognized the clatter of an explosive-combustion engine , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now propelling a wagon bearing several men and a pile of glittering apparatus ! At once I observed one unforeseen advantage of horseless transportation  --  to allow human beings to ride toward danger that no horse on Earth would ever approach . <p> The hissing contraption ground to a halt not far from Beauchamp and me . Then a shout burst forth in that most penetrating of human accents  --  one habituated to open spaces and vast expanses . <p> " Come on , you Gol-durned piece of junk ! Fire on up , or I 'll turn ya into scrap b'fore the Martians do ! " <p> The speaker was dressed as a workman , with bandoliers of tools arrayed across his broad , sturdy frame . A shock of reddish hair escaped under the rim of a large , curve-brimmed hat , of the type affected by the troupe of Buffalo Bill , when that showman 's carnival was the sensation of Europe , some years back . <p> " Come now , Ernst , " answered the man beside him , in a voice both more cultured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . Perhaps we are already near enough to acquire the data we seek . " <p> An uneasy alliance of distant cousins , I realized . Although I have always admired users of the English language for their boundless ingenuity , it can be hard to see the countrymen of Edgar Allan Poe as related to those of Walter Scott . <p> " What do you say , Fraunhoffer ? " asked the Englishman of a third gentleman with the portly bearing of one who dearly loves his schnitzel , now peering through an array of lenses toward the battling tripods . " Can you get a good reading from here ? " <p> " Bah ! " The bald-pated German cursed . " From ze exploding buildings and fiery desolation , I get plenty of lines , those typical of combustion . But ze rays zemselves are absurd . Utterly absurd ! " <p> I surmised that here were scientists at work , even as I had prescribed in my discourse to Beauchamp , doing the labor of sixty battalions . In such efforts by luminous minds lay our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth head emerged , that of a dark young man , wearing objects over his ears that resembled muffs for protection against cold weather , only these were made of wood , linked by black cord to a machine covered with dials . I at once recognized miniature speaker-phones , for presenting faint sounds directly to the ears . The young man 's accent was Italian , and curiously calm . " What is absurd about the spectrum of-a the rays , Professor ? " <p> " There iss no spectrum ! " the German expounded . " My device shows just the one hue of red light we see with our naked eyes , when the rays lash destructive force . There are no absorption lines , just a single hue of brilliant red ! " <p> The Italian pursed his lips in thought . " One frequency , perhaps . . . ? " <p> " If you insist on comparing light to your vulgar Hertzlan waves  --  " <p> So entranced was I by the discussion that I was almost knocked down by Beauchamp 's frantic effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him to behave so  --  the Martians must nearly be upon us ! With this supposition in mind , I turned , expecting to see a disk-like foot of a leviathan preparing to crush us . <p> Instead , Beauchamp , white as a ghost , stammered and pointed with a palsied hand . " Verne , regardez ! " <p> To my amazement , the invaders had abruptly changed course , swerving from the direct route to the Seine . Instead they turned left and were stomping swiftly toward the part of town that Beauchamp and I had only just left , crushing buildings to dust as they hurried ahead . At the time , we shared a single thought . The commanders of the battle tripods must have spied the military camp on the Champ-de-Mars . Or else they planned to wipe out the nearby military academy . It even crossed my mind that their objective might be the tomb of humanity 's greatest general , to destroy that shrine , and with it our spirit to resist . <p> But no . Only much later did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanquishers suddenly had another kind of conquest in mind . <p> Flames spread as evening fell . Although the Martian rampage seemed to have slackened somewhat , the city 's attitude of sang-froid was melting rapidly into frothy panic . The broad boulevards that Baron Haussmann gave the city during the Second Empire proved their worth as aisles of escape while buildings burned . <p> But not for all . By nightfall , Beauchamp and I found ourselves across the river at the new army headquarters , in the tree-lined Tuileries , just west of the Louvre - as if the military had decided to make its last stand in front of the great museum , delaying the invaders in order to give the curators more time to rescue treasures . <p> A great crowd surrounded a cage wherein , some said , several captured Martians cowered . Beauchamp rushed off to see , but I had learned to heed my subconscious  --  ( to use the terminology of the Austrian alienist , Freud )  --  and wandered about the camp instead . Letting the spectacle play in my mind . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map , I found my gaze wandering to the trampled gardens , backlit by fire , and wondered what the painter , Camille Pissaro , would make of such a hellish scene . Just a month ago I had visited his apartment at 2.04 rue de Rivoli , to see a series of impressions he had undertaken to portray the peaceful Tuileries . Now , what a parody fate had decreed for these same gardens ! <p> The colonel had explained that invader tripods came in two sizes , with the larger ones appearing to control the smaller . There were many of the latter kind , still rampaging the city suburbs , but all three of the great ones reported to be in Northern France had converged on the same site before nightfall , trampling back and forth across the Champ.de-Mars , presenting a series of strange behaviors that as yet had no lucid explanation . I did not need a military expert to tell me what I had seen with my own eyes . . . three titanic metal leviathans , twisting arid capering as if in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fierce attention . <p> I wandered away from the briefing , and peered for a while at the foreign scientists . The Italian and the German were arguing vehemently , invoking the name of the physicist Boltzmann , with his heretical theories of " atomic matter , " trying to explain why the heat ray of the aliens should emerge as just a single , narrow color . But the discussion was over my head , so I moved on . <p> The American and the Englishman seemed more pragmatic , consulting with French munitions experts about a type of fulminating bomb that might be attached to a Martian machine 's kneecap  --  if only some way could be found to carry it there . . . and to get the machine to stand still while it was attached . I doubted any explosive device devised overnight would suffice , since artillery had been next to useless , but I envied the adventure of the volunteer bomber , whoever it might be . <p> Adventure . I had spent decades writing about it , nearly always in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas , or under the waves , or over icecaps , or to the shimmering moon . Millions read my works to escape the tedium of daily life , and perhaps to catch a glimpse of the near future . Only now the future had arrived , containing enough excitement for anybody . We did not have to seek adventure far away . It had come to us . Right to our homes . <p> The crowd had ebbed somewhat , in the area surrounding the prisoners ' enclosure , so I went over to join Beauchamp . He had been standing there for hours , staring at the captives , our only prizes in this horrid war , lying caged within stout iron bars , a dismal set of figures , limp yet atrociously fascinating . <p> " Have they any new ideas ? " Beauchamp asked in a distracted voice , while keeping his eyes focused toward the four beings from Mars . " What new plans from the military geniuses ? " <p> The last was spoken with thick sarcasm . His attitude had changed since noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found in the master tripods , those that are right now stomping flat the region near Eiffel 's Spire . Never have all three of the Master Machines been seen so close together . Experts suggest that the Martians may use movement to communicate . The dance they are now performing may represent a conference on strategy . Perhaps they are planning their next move , now that they have taken Paris . " <p> Beauchamp grunted . It seemed to make as much sense as any other proposal to explain the aliens ' sudden , strange behavior . While smaller tripods roamed about , dealing destruction almost randomly , the three great ones hopped and flopped like horons in a marsh , gesticulating wildly with their flailing legs , all this in marked contrast to the demure solidity of Eiffel 's needle . <p> For a time we stared in silence at the prisoners , whose projectile had hurtled across unimaginable space only to shatter when it struck an unlucky hard place on the Earth , shattering open and leaving its occupants helpless , at our mercy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if this world weighed heavy on their limbs . Or had another kind of languor invaded their beings . A depression of spirits , perhaps ? <p> " I have pondered one thing , while standing here , " Beauchamp mumbled . " An oddity about these creatures . We had been told that everything about them came in threes . . . note the trio of legs , and of arms , and of eyes  --  " <p> " As we have seen in newspaper sketches , for weeks , " I replied . <p> " Indeed : But regard the one in the center . The one around which the others arrayed themselves , as if protectively . . . or perhaps in mutual competition. ? " <p> I saw the one he meant . Slightly larger than the rest , with a narrower aspect in the region of the conical head . <p> " Yes , it does seem different , somehow . . . but I do n't see  --  " <p> I stopped , for just then I did see . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Its legs and arms . . . there are four ! Its symmetry is different ! Can it be of another race ? A servant species , perhaps ? Or something superior ? Or else . . . " <p> My next cry was of excited elation . <p> " Beauchamp ! The master tripods . . . I believe I know what they are doing ! <p> " Moreover , I believe this beckons us with opportunity . " <p> The bridges were sheer madness , while the river flowing underneath seemed chock-a-block with corpses . It took our party two hours to fight our way against the stream of panicky human refugees , before the makeshift expedition finally arrived close enough to make out how the dance progressed . <p> " They are closer , are they not. ? " I asked the lieutenant assigned to guide us . " Have they been spiraling inward at a steady rate ? " <p> The young officer nodded . " Oui , Monsieur . It now seems clear that all three are converging on Eiffel 's Tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " <p> I laughed , remembering the thought that had struck me earlier  --  a mental image of herons dancing in a swamp . The comparison renewed when I next looked upward in awe at the stomping , whirlinggyrations of the mighty battle machines , shattering buildings and making the earth shake with each hammer blow of their mincing feet . Steam hissed from broken mains . Basements and ossuaries collapsed , but the dance went on . Three monstrous things , wheeling ever closer to their chosen goal . . . which waited quietly , demurely , like a giant metal ingenue . <p> " Oh , they will converge all right , lieutenant . The question is  --  shall we be ready when they do ? " <p> My mind churned . <p> The essential task in envisioning the future is a capacity for wonder . I had said as much to journalists . These Martians lived in a future of technological effects we could but imagine . Only through such visualization could we glimpse their Achilles heel . <p> Now was the crucial moment when wonder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth to action . <p> Wonder . . . a fine word , but what did it mean ? Summoning up an inner eye , which could scale up the present , pregnant with possibility , into . . . into . . . <p> What , then ? Hertz , his waves , circuits , capacitors , wires  --  <p> Beauchamp glanced nervously around . " Even if you could get the attention of the military  --  " <p> " For such tasks the army is useless . I am thinking of something else . " I said suddenly , filled with an assurance I could not explain . " The Martians will soon converge at the center of their obsession . And when they do , we shall be ready . " <p> " Ready with what ? " <p> " With what lies within our  --  " and here I thought of the pun , a glittering word soaring up from the shadowy subconscious "  --  within our capacitance . " <p> The events of that long night compressed for me . I had hit upon the kernel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insuperable barrier . <p> Fortunately , I had not taken into account the skills of other men , especially the great leadership ability of my friend , M. Beauchamp . He had commanded a battalion against the Prussians , dominating his comer of the battlefield without runners . With more like him , Sedan would never have fallen . His voice rose above the streaming crowds , and plucked forth from that torrent those who still had a will to contest the pillage of their city . He pointed to my figure , whom many seemed to know . My heart swelled at the thought that Frenchmen  --  and Frenchwomen !  --  would muster to a hasty cause upon the mention of my name , encouraged solely by the thought that I might offer a way to fight back . <p> I tried to describe my ideas as briskly as possible . . . but alas , brevity has never been my chief virtue . So I suppressed a flash of pique when the brash American , following the impulsive nature of his race , leaped up and shouted  --  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got it ! " <p>  --  and then , in vulgar but concise French , he proceeded to lay it all out in a matter of moments , conveying the practical essentials amid growing excitement from the crowd . <p> With an excited roar , our makeshift army set at once to work . <p> I am not a man of many particulars . But craftsmen and workers and simple men of manual dexterity stepped in while engineers , led by the Italian and the American , took charge of the practical details , charging about with the gusto of youth , unstoppable in their enthusiasm . In fevered haste , bands of patriots ripped the zinc sheets from bars . They scavenged the homes of the rich in search of silver . No time to beat it into proper electrodes  --  they connected decanters and candlesticks into makeshift assortments . These they linked with copper wires , fetched from the cabling of the new electrical tramways . <p> The electropotentials of the silver with the copper , in the proper conducting medium , would be monstrously reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such a battery , shape does not matter so much as surface area , and proper wiring . Working through the smoky night , teams took these rode pieces and made a miracle of rare design . The metals they immersed in a salty solution , emptying the wine vats of the district to make room , spilling the streets red , and giving any true Frenchman even greater cause to think only of vengeance ! <p> These impromptu batteries , duplicated throughout the arrondissement , the quick engineers soon webbed together in a vast parallel circuit . Amid the preparations , M. Beauchamp and the English scientist inquired into my underlying logic . <p> " Consider the simple equations of planetary motion , " I said . " Even though shot from the Martian surface with great speed , the time to reach Earth must be many months , perhaps a year . " <p> " One can endure space for such a time ? " Beauchamp frowned . <p> " Space , yes . It is mere vacuum . Tanks of their air  --  thin stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But think ! These Martians , they must have intelligence of our rank . They left their kind to venture forth and do battle . Several years without the comforts of home , until they have subdued our world and can send for more of their kind . " <p> The Englishman seemed perplexed . " For more ? " <p> " Specifically , for their families , their mates . . . dare I say their wives ! Though it would seem that not all were left behind . At least one came along in the first wave , out of need for her expertise , perhaps , or possibly she was smuggled along on the ill-fated missile that our forces captured . " <p> Beauchamp bellowed . " Zut ! The four-legged one . There are reports of no others . You are right , Verne . It must be rare to bring one of that kind so close to battle ! " <p> The Englishman shook his head . " Even if this is so , I do not follow how it applies to this situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nearing the tower , their gyrations now tight , their dance more languorous . Carefully , reverentially , yet with a clear longing they reached out to the great spire that Paris had almost voted to tear down , just a few years after the Grand Exhibition ended . Now all our hopes were founded in the city 's wise decision to let M. Eiffel 's masterpiece stand . <p> The Martians stroked its base , clasped the thick parts of the tower 's curving thigh  --  and commenced slowly to climb . <p> Beauchamp smirked at the English scholar , perhaps with a light touch of malice . " I expect you would not understand , sir . It is not in your national character to fathom this , ah , ritual . " <p> " Humph ! " Unwisely , the Englishman used Beauchamp 's teasing as cause to take offense . " I 'll wager that we give these Martians a whipping before your lot does ! " <p> " Ah yes , " Beauchamp remarked . " Whipping is more along the lines of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I chided my dear friend . After all , our work was now done . The young , the skilled , and the brave had the task well in hand . Like generals who have unleashed their regiments beyond recall , we had only to observe , awaiting either triumph or blame . <p> At dawn , an array of dozens and dozens of Volta batteries lay scattered across the south bank of the Seine . Some fell prey to rampages by smaller Martian machines , while others melted under hasty application of fuming acids . Cabling wound through streets where buildings burned and women wept . Despite all obstacles of flame , rubble , and burning rays , all now terminated at Eiffel 's tower . <p> The Martians ' ardent climb grew manifestly amorous as the sun rose in piercing brilliance ; warming our chilled bones : I was near the end of my endurance , sustained only by the excitement of observing Frenchmen and women fighting back with ingenuity and rare unity . But as the Martians scaled the tower  --  driven by urges we can guess by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simple , but could it work ? <p> I conferred with the dark Italian who supervised the connections . <p> " Potentials ? Voltages ? " He screwed up his face . " Who has had-a time to calculate . All I know , M'sewer , iz that we got-a plenty juice . You want-a fry a fish , use a hot flame . " <p> I took his point . Even at comparatively low voltages , high currents can destroy any organism . A mere fraction of an Ampere can kill a man , if his skin is made a reasonable conductor by application of water , for example . Thus , we took it as a sign of a higher power at work , when the bright sun fell behind a glowering black cloud , and an early mist rolled in from the north . It made the tower slick beneath the orange lamps we had festooned about it . <p> And still the Martians climbed . <p> It was necessary to coordinate the discharge of so many batteries in one powerful jolt , a mustering of beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , within sight of the giant , spectral figures which now had mounted a third of the way up the tower . <p> " Hey Verne ! " The American shouted , with well-meant impudence . " You 're on ! " <p> I turned to see that a crowd had gathered . Their expressions of tense hope touched this old man 's heart . Hope and faith in my idea . There would be no higher point in the life of a fabulist . <p> " Connect ! " I cried . " Loose the hounds of electrodynamics ! " <p> A skyrocket leaped forth , trailing sooty smoke  --  a makeshift signal , but sufficient . <p> Down by the river and underneath a hundred ruins , scores of gaps and switches closed . Capacitors arced . A crackling rose from around the city as stored energy rushed along the copper cabling . I imagined for an instant the onrushing mob of beta rays , converging on  --  <p> The invaders suddenly shuddered , and soon there emerged thin , high cries , screams that were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wails rose in hopeless agony , shrieks of despair from mouths which breathed lighter air than we , but knew the same depths of woe . <p> They toppled one by one , tumbling in the morning mist , crashing to shatter on the trampled lawns and cobblestones of the ironically named Champ-de-Mars . . . marshaling ground of the god of war , and now graveyard of his planetary champions . <p> The lesser machines , deprived of guidance , soon reeled away , some falling into the river , and many others destroyed by artillery , or even enraged mobs . So the threat ebbed from its horrid peak . . . at least for the time being . <p> As my reward for these services , I would ask that the site be renamed , for it was not the arts of battle which turned the metal monsters into burning slag . Nor even Zeus 's lightning , which we had unleashed . In the final analysis , it was Aphrodite who had come to the aid of her favorite city . <p> What a fitting way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die passionately in Paris , from a fatal love . <p> <p> By Gregory Benford &; David Brin <p>
