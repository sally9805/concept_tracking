New York Times best selling writer Dave Wolverton made quite a splash when he first appeared on the science fiction scene . His short story , " On My Way to Paradise , " won the Grand Prize of the Writers of the Future contest . The story became a novel ; and Dave went on to become the preliminary judge lot the contest . Since the story appeared , Dave has primarily concentrated on novels . In addition to writing the most romantic Star Wars novel The Courtship o Princess Leia , for Bantam Books , Dave has written a series of other novels . Tot Books published his most recent books , The Golden Queen and Beyond the Gate , and will soon publish his next , Lords of the Seventh Swarm . <p> " After a Lean Winter , " our final Martian story , shows that Dave is still a master of the short form . <p> Pierre swept into hidden Lodge on Titchen Creek late on a moonless night . His two sled dogs huffed and bunched their shoulders , then dug their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they crossed that last stubborn rise . The runners of his sled rang over the crusted snow with the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard , and the leather harnesses creaked . <p> The air that night had a fetal bite to it . The sun had been down for days , sometimes hovering near the horizon , and the deadly winter chill was on . It would be a month before we 'd see the sun again . For weeks we had felt that cold air gnawing us , chewing away at our vitality , like a wolf pup worrying a shard of caribou bone long after the marrow is depleted . <p> In the distance , billowing thunderclouds raced toward us under the glimmering stars , promising some insulating warmth . A storm was chasing Pierre 's trail . By agreement , no one came to the lodge until just before a storm , and none stayed long after the storm began . <p> Pierre 's two poor huskies caught the scent of camp and yipped softly . Pierre called " Gee , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carefully , he twisted the gee-poles , laid the sled on its side next to a dozen others . I noted a heavy bundle lashed to the sled , perhaps a moose haunch , and I licked my lips involuntarily . I 'd pay well for some meat . <p> From out under the trees , the other pack dogs sniffed and approached , too tired to growl or threaten . One of Pierre 's huskies yapped again , and Pierre leapt forward with a dog-whip , threatening the lean beast until it fell silent . We did not tolerate noise from dogs anymore . Many a man would have pulled a knife and gutted that dog where it stood , but Pierre  --  a very crafty and once-prosperous trapper  --  was down to only two dogs . <p> " S'okay , " I said from my watch post , putting him at ease . " No Martians about . " Indeed , the frozen tundra before me was barren for miles . In the distance was a meandering line of wizened spruce , black in the starlight , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a winding frozen river just below the lodge . The distant mountains were dark red with lush new growth of Martian foliage . But mostly the land was snow-covered tundra . No Martian ships floated cloudlike over the snowfields . Pierre glanced up toward me , unable to make out my form . <p> " Jacques ? Jacques Lowndunn ? Dat you ? " he called , his voice muffled by the wolverine-fur trim of his parka . " What news , my tren ? Eh ? " <p> " No one 's had sight of the bloody-minded Martians in two weeks , " I said . " They cleared out of Juneau . " <p> There had been a brutal raid on the town of Dawson some weeks before , and the Martians had captured the whole town , harvesting the unlucky inhabitants for their blood . We 'd thought then that the Martians were working their way north , that they 'd blaze a path to Titchen Creek . We could hardly go much farther north this time of year . Even if we could drag along enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trail in the snow . So we dug in , holed up for the winter . <p> " Ah ' ave seen de Marshawns . Certayne ! " Pierre said in his nasal voice , hunching his shoulders . He left the dogs in their harness but fed them each a handful of smoked salmon . I was eager to hear his news , but he made me wait . He grabbed his rifle from its scabbard , for no one would walk about unarmed , then forged up toward the lodge , plodding toward me through the crusted snow , floundering deeper and deeper into the drifts with every step , until he climbed up on the porch . There was no friendly light behind me to guide his steps . Such a light would have shown us up to the Martians . <p> " Where did you spot them ? " I asked . <p> " Anchorawge , " he grunted , stamping his feet and brushing snow out of his parka before entering the warmer lodge . " De citee ees gone , Jacques  --  dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spat in the snow . " De Martians es dere ! " <p> Only once had I ever had the misfortune of observing a Martian . It was when Bessie and I were on the steamer up from San Francisco . We 'd sailed to Puget Sound , and in Seattle we almost put to port . But the Martians had landed , and we saw one of their warriors wearing a metal body that gleamed sullenly like polished brass . It stood watch , its curved protective armor stretching above its head like the chitinous shell of a crab , its lank , tripod metal legs letting it stand gracefully a hundred feet in the air . At first , one would have thought it an inanimate tower , but it twisted ever so insignificantly as we moved closer , regarding us as a jumping spider will a gnat , just before it pounces . We notified the captain , and he kept sailing north , leaving the Martian to hunt on its lonely stretch of beach , gleaming in the afternoon sun . <p> Bessie and I had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not imagine any other place than the land near the Circle that is quite so relentlessly inhospitable to life , yet I am intimate with the petty moods of this land , which I have always viewed as something of a mean-spirited accountant which requires every beast upon it to pay his exact dues each year , or die . I had not thought the Martians would be able to survive here , so Bessie and I took our few possessions and struck out from the haven of San Francisco for the bitter wastes north of Juneau . We were so naive . <p> If the Martians were in Anchorage , then Pierre 's tidings were mixed . It was good that they were hundreds of miles away , bad that they were still alive at all . In warmer climes , it was said , they died quickly from bacterial infections . But that was not true here by the Circle . The Martians were thriving in our frozen wastes . Their crops grew at a tremendous rate on any patch of frozen windswept ground  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Apparently , Mars is a world that is colder and darker than ours , and what is for us an intolerable frozen hell is to them a balmy paradise . <p> Pierre finished stamping off his shoes and lifted the latch to the door . Nearly everyone had already made it to our conclave . Simmons , Coldwell and Porter had n't shown , and it was growing so late that I did n't anticipate that they would make it this time . They were busy with other affairs , or the Martians had harvested them . <p> I was eager to hear Pierre 's full account , so I followed him into the lodge . <p> In more congenial days , we would have had the iron stove crackling merrily to warm the place . But we could n't risk such a comforting blaze now . Only a meager lamp consigned to the floor furnished any light for the room . Around the lodge , bundled in bulky furs in their unceasing struggle to get warm , were two dozen stolid men and women of the north . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent and bleak , there was a cordial atmosphere now that we had all gathered . A special batch of hootch warmed on a tripod above the lamp . Everyone rousted a bit when Pierre came through the door , edging away enough to make room for him near the lamp . <p> " What news ? " One-Eyed Kate called before Pierre could even kneel by the lamp and pull off his mittens with his teeth . He put his hands down to toast by the glass of the lamp . <p> Pierre did n't speak . It must have been eighty below outside , and his jaw was leather-stiff from the cold . His lips were tinged with blue , and ice crystals lodged in his brows , eyelashes , and beard . <p> Still , we all hung on expectantly for a word of news . Then I saw his mood . He did n't like most of the people in this room , though he had a warm spot in his heart for me . Pierre had Indian blood on his mother 's side , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . He 'd make them pay for every word he uttered . He grunted , nodded toward the kettle of hootch on the tripod . <p> One-Eyed Kate herself dipped in a battered tin mug , handed it to him . Still he did n't utter a word . He 'd been nursing a grudge for the past two months . Pierre Jelenc was a trapper of almost legendary repute here in the north , a tough and cunning man . Some folks down at the Hudson Bay Company said he 'd devoted a huge portion of his grub stake to new traps last spring . The north had had two soft winters in a row , so the trapping promised to be exceptional  --  the best in forty years . <p> Then the Martians had come , making it impossible for a man to run his trap lines . So while the miners toiled in their shafts through the dark winter , getting wealthier by the minute , Pierre had a lost a year 's grub stake , and now all of his traps were scattered in their line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his keen mind , would n't be able to find most of those traps next spring . <p> Two months ago , Pierre had made one desperate attempt to recoup his losses here at Hidden Lodge . In a drunken frenzy , he started fighting his sled dogs in the big pit out behind the lodge . But his dogs had n't been eating well , so he could n't milk any fight out of them . Five of his huskies got slaughtered in the pit that night . Afterward , Pierre had left in a black rage , and had n't attended a conclave since . <p> Pierre downed the mug of hootch . It was a devil 's concoction of brandy , whiskey , and hot peppers . He handed the cup back to One-Eyed Kate for a refill . <p> Evidently , Doctor Weatherby had been reading from an article in a newspaper  --  a paper nearly three months old out of southern Alberta . <p> " I say , right then , " Doctor Weatherby said in a chipper tone . Apparently he thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to let Pierre speak when he desired . I listened intently , for it was the Doctor I had come to see , hoping he would be able to help my Bessie . " As I reported , Doctor Silvena in Edmonton thinks that there may be more than the cold at work here to help keep the Martians alive . He notes that the ' thin and rarefied air here in the north is more beneficial to the lungs than air in the south , which is clogged with myriad pollens and unhealthy germs . Moreover , ' he states , ' there seems to be some quality to the light here in the far north that causes it to destroy detrimental germs . We in the north are marvelously free of many plagues found in warmer lands  --  leprosy , elephantiasis , and such . Even typhoid and diphtheria are seldom seen here , and the terrible fevers which rampage warmer climes are almost unknown among our native Inuit . ' He goes on to say that , ' Contrary to speculation that the Martians here will expire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently , it may be that the Martian will hold forth on our northern frontier indefinitely . Indeed , they may gradually acclimatize themselves to our air , and , like the Indians who have grown resistant to our European measles and chicken pox , in time they may once again venture into more temperate zones . ' " <p> " Not a'fore bears grow wings , " Klondike Pete Kandinsky hooted . " It 's cold enough to freeze the balls off a pool table out that this winter . Most like , we 'll find them Martians all laid out next spring , thawing in some snowbank . " <p> Klondike Pete was behind the times . Rumor said that he 'd struck a rich vein in his gold mine , so he 'd holed up in the shaft , working eighteen-hour days from August through Christmas , barely taking time to come out for supplies . He had n't attended our previous conclaves . <p> " Gads , " Doctor Weatherby said , " I say , where have you been ? We believe that the Martians came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're seeking our warmer dimes . But just because they are looking for warmer weather , it does n't mean they want to bye on our equator ! What seems monstrously cold to us  --  that biting winter that we 've suffered through this past three months  --  is positively balmy on Mars ! I 'm sure they 're much invigorated by it . Indeed , the reason we have n't seen more of the Martians here in the past weeks seems blatantly obvious : they 're preparing to migrate north , to our polar cap ! " <p> " Ah , Gods , I swear ! " Klondike Pete shook his head mournfully , realizing our predicament for the first time . " Why do n't the Army do somethin ? Teddy Roosevelt or the Mounties ought to do somethin . " <p> " They 're playing at waiting " One-Eyed Kate grumbled . " You know what kinds of horrors they 've been through down south . There 's not much the armies of the world can do against the Martians . Even if they could send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no sense in it  --  not when the varmints might die out this coming spring anyhow . " <p> " There 's sense ' n it ! " one old timer said . " Folks is dyin ' up here ! The Martians squeeze us for blood , then toss our carcasses ' way like grape skins ! " <p> " Yeah , " One-Eyed Kate said , " and so long as it 's the likes of you and me that are doing the dying Tom King no one will do more than yawn about it ! " <p> The refugees in the room looked around gloomily at one another . Trappers , miners , Indians , crackpots who 'd fled from the world . We were an unsavory lot , dressed in our hides , with sour bear grease rubbed in our skin to keep out the weather . One-Eyed Kate was right . No one would rescue us . <p> " I just whist we ' ad word on them Martians , " old Tom King said , wiping his nose on the sleeve of his parka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No news is good news , " he intoned , the hollow-sounding supplication of an atheist . <p> None of us believed the adage . The Martian vehicles that fell in the southern climes were filled only with a few armies and scouts . Thirty or forty troops per vehicle , if we judged right . But now we saw that these were only the advance forces , hardly more than scouts who were meant , perhaps , to decimate our armies and harass the greater population of the world in preparation for the most massive vehicle , the one that fell two months later than the rest , just south of Juneau . The mother ship had carried two thousand Martians , some guessed , along with their weird herds of humanoid bipeds that the Martians harvested for blood . The mother vehicle had hardly settled when thousands of their slaves swarmed out of the ships and began planting crops , scattering otherworldly seeds that sprouted nearly overnight into grotesque forests of twisted growths that looked like coral or cactuses , but which Doctor Weatherby assured us were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants grew two hundred yards high in the ensuing month , so that it was said that now , one could hardly travel south of Juneau in most places . The " Great Northern Martian Jungle " formed a virtually impenetrable barrier to the southlands , a barrier reputed to harbor Martian bipeds who hunted humans so that their masters might feast on our blood . <p> " If no news is good news , then let us toast good news , " Klondike Pete said , hoisting his mug . <p> " Ah 've seen dem Marshawns , " Pierre said at last . " En Anchorawge . Dey burned de ceety , by Gat , and dey are building , building  --  making new ceety dat is strange and wondrous ! " <p> There were cries of horror and astonishment , people crying out queries . " When , when did you see them ? " Doctor Weatherby asked , shouting to be heard above the others . <p> " Twelve days now , " Pierre said . " Dere a jungle growing around Anchorawge now  --  very thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and night to build dere machine ceety . Dere ceety  --  how shall I say ?  --  is magnificent , by Gat ! Eet stands five hundred feet tall , and can walk about on eets three legs like a walking stool . But is not a small stool  --  is huge , by Gat , a mile across ! <p> " On de top of de table , is huge glass bowl , alive with shimmering work-lights , more varied and magnificent dan de lights of Paris ! And under dis dome , de Marshawns building dere home . " <p> Doctor Weatherby 's eyes opened wide in astonishment . " A dome , you say ? Fantastic ! Are they sealing themselves in ? Could it keep out bacteria ? " <p> Pierre shrugged . " Ah ' uz too far away to see dis taim . Some taim , maybe , Ah go back  --  look more closer . Eh ? " <p> " Horse feathers ! " Klondike Pete said . " Them Martians could n't raise such a huge city in two months . Frenchie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pulls my legs ! " <p> There was an expectant hush around the room , and none dared intervene between the two men . I think that most of us at least half believed Pierre . No one knew what the Martians were capable of . They flew between worlds and built killing death rays . They switched mechanical bodies as easily as we changed clothes . We could not guess their limitations . <p> Only Klondike Pete here was ignorant enough to doubt the Frenchman . Pierre scowled up at Pete . The little Frenchman was not used to having someone call him a liar , and many honest men so accused would have pulled a knife to defend their honor . A fight was almost expected , but in any physical contest , Pierre would not equal Klondike Pete . <p> But Pierre obviously had another plan in mind . A secretive smile stole across his face , and I imagined how he might be plotting to ambush the bigger man on some dark night , steal his gold . So many men had been taken by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely never learn the truth of it . <p> But that was not Pierre 's plan . He downed another mug of hootch , banged his empty mug on the lid of the cold iron stove at his side . Almost as if magically summoned , a blast of wind struck the lodge , whistling through the eaves of the log cabin . I 'd been vaguely aware of the rising wind for the past few minutes , but only then did I recognize that the full storm had just hit . <p> By custom , when a storm hit we would set a mating blaze and lavish upon ourselves one or two hours of warmth before trudging back to our own cabins or mine shafts . If we timed it properly , the last of the storm would blanket our trail , concealing our passage from any Martians that might fly over , hunting us . <p> Still , some of us were clumsy . Over the past three months , our numbers had been steadily diminishing our people disappearing as the Martians harvested us . <p> My thoughts turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our cabin , sick and weakened by the interminable cold . <p> " Storm 's here , stoke up the fire ! " someone shouted , and One-Eyed Kate opened the iron door to the old stove and struck a match . The tinder had already been set , perhaps for days , in anticipation of this moment . <p> Soon a roaring blaze crackled in the old iron stove . We huddled in a circle , each of us silent and grateful , grunting with satisfaction . During the storms , the Martian flying machines were forced to seek shelter in secluded valleys , it was said , and so we did not fear that the Martians would attack . The bipeds that the Martians used for food and as slaves might attack , I suspected , if they saw our smoke , but this was unlikely . We were far from the Martian Jungles , and it was rumored that the bipeds held forth only in their own familiar domain . <p> After the past two weeks of damnable cold , we needed some warmth , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others began to sigh in contentment . I hoped that Bessie had lit our own little stove back in the old mining shack we called home . <p> Pierre put his gloves back on , and the little man was beginning to feel the effects of his drinks . He weaved a little as he stood , and growled , " By Gat , your dogs weel fait mah beast tonait ! " <p> " You 're down to only two dogs , " I reminded Pierre . He was n't a careless sort , unless he got chunk . I knew he was n't thinking clearly . He could n't afford to lose another dog in a senseless fight . <p> " Damn you , Jacques ! Your dogs weel fait mah beast tonait ! " He pounded the red-hot stove with a gloved fist , staggered toward me with a crazed gleam in his eyes . <p> I wanted to protect him from himself . " No one wants to fight your dogs tonight , " I said . <p> Pierre staggered to me , grabbed my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seamed and scarred by the cold , and though he was drunk , there was a cunning glint in his eyes . " Your dogs , weel fait , my beast , tonait ! " <p> The room went silent . " What beast are you talking about ? " One-Eyed Kate said . <p> " You looking for Marshawns , no ? " he turned to her and waved expansively . " You want see a Marshawn ? Your dogs keeled mah dogs . Now your dogs weel fait mah Marshawn ! " <p> My heart began pounding , and my thoughts raced . We had not seen Pierre in weeks , and it was said that he was one of the finest trappers in the Yukon . As my mind registered what he 'd brought back from Anchorage , as I realized what he 'd trapped there , I recalled the heavy bundle tied to his sled . Could he really have secured a live Martian ? <p> Suddenly there was shouting in the room from a dozen voices . Several men grabbed a lantern and dashed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . Klondike Pete was shouting , " How much ? How much do you want to fight your beast ? " <p> " I say , heaven forbid ! Let 's not have a fight ! " Doctor Weatherby began saying . " I want to study the creature ! " <p> But the sudden fury with which the others met the doctor 's plea was overwhelming . <p> We were outraged by the Martians for our burnt cities , for the poisoned crops , for the soldiers who died under Martian heat beams or choked to death in the vile Black Fog that emanated from their guns . More than all of this , we raged against the Martians for our fair daughters and children who had gone to feed these vile beasts , these Martians who drank our blood as we drain water . <p> So great was this primal rage , that someone struck the doctor  --  more in some mindless animal instinct , some basic need to see the Martian dead , than out of anger at the good man who had worked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The doctor crumpled under the weight of the blow and knelt on the floor for a moment , staring down at the dirty wood planks , trying to regain his senses . <p> Meanwhile , others took up the shout , " There 's a game for you ! " " How much to fight it ? What do you want ? " <p> Pierre stood in a swirling , writhing , shouting maelstrom . I know logically that there could not have been two dozen people in the room , yet it seemed like vastly more . Indeed , it seemed to my mind that all of troubled humanity crowded the room at that moment , hurling fists in the air , cursing , threatening , mindlessly crying for blood . <p> I found myself screaming to be heard , " How much ? How much ? " And though I have never been one to engage in the savage sport of dog fighting I though t of my own sled dogs out in front of the lodge , and I considered how much I 'd be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was simple : <p> I 'd pay everything I owned . <p> Pierre raised his hands in the air for silence , and named his price , and if you think it unfairly high , then remember this : we all secretly believed that we would die before spring . Money meant almost nothing to us . Most of us had been unable to get adequately outfitted for winter , and had hoped that a moose or a caribou would get us through the lean months . But Martians harvested the caribou and moose just as they harvested us . Many a man in that room knew that he 'd be down to eating his sled dogs by spring . Money means nothing to those who wish only to survive . <p> Yet we knew that many would profit from the Martian invasion . In the south , insurance hucksters were selling policies against future invasions , the loggers and financiers were making fortunes , and every man who 'd ever handled a hammer suddenly called himself a master carpenter and sought to hire himself out at inflated prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to recoup his losses after this most horrible of winters . <p> " De beast has sixteen tentacles , " he said , " so Ah weel let you fight heem with eight dogs  --  at five thousand doughlars a dog : Two thousand doughlars for me , and de rest , goes for de winner , or de winners , of de fait ! " <p> The accounts we 'd read about Martians suggested that without their metallic bodies , they moved ponderously slow here on Earth . The increased gravity of our world , where everything is three times heavier than on Mars , weighed them down greatly . I 'd never seen a bear pitted against more than eight dogs , so it seemed unlikely that the Martian could win . But with each contestant putting in two thousand dollars just for the right to fight , Pierre would go home with at least $16,000  --  five times what he 'd make in a good year . All he had to do was let people pay for the right to kill a Martian . <p> Klondike Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two huskies ! " he roared . <p> " Grip can take him ! " One-Eyed Kate said . " You 'll let a pit bull fight ? " <p> Pierre nodded , and I began calculating . If you counted most of my supplies , I had barely enough for a stake in the fight , and I had a dog I thought could win - half husky , half wolfhound . He 'd outweigh any of the other mutts in the pit , and he pulled the sled with great heart . He was a natural leader . <p> But I caught that sly gleam in Pierre 's dark eyes . I knew that this fight would be more than any of us were bargaining for . I hesitated . <p> " By Gol ' , I 'll put in my fighter , " old Tom King offered with evident bloodlust , and in half a moment four other men signed their notes to Pierre . The fight was set . <p> The storm raged . Snow pounded in unbounded avarice , skirling across the frozen crust of the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the blizzard , held them over the fighting pit . At the north end , a bear cage could be lowered into the pit by means of a winch . At the south end , a dog run led down . <p> Klondike Pete leapt in and flattened the snow , then climbed back up through the dog run . Everyone unhitched and brought their dogs from the sleds , then herded them down the run . The dogs smelled the excitement , yapped and growled , stalking through the pit and sniffing uneasily . <p> Someone began winching the big cage up , and the dogs settled down . Some of the dogs had battled bears , and so knew the sound of the winch . One-Eyed Kate 's pit bull emitted a coughing bark and began leaping in excitement , wanting to draw first blood from whatever we loosed into the pit . <p> It was a ghoulish mob that stood around that dark pit , pale faces lit dimly by the oily lanterns that flickered and guttered with every gust of wind . <p> Four men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lodge . The bundle was wrapped in heavy canvas and tied solidly with five or six hi de ropes of Eskimo make . A couple of men worried at the knots , trying to untie the frozen leather , while two others stood nearby with rifles cocked , aimed at the bundle . <p> Pierre swore softly , drew his Bowie knife and sliced through the ropes , then rolled the canvas over several times . The canvas was wound tight around the Martian six turns , so that one moment I was peering through the driving snow while trying to make out the form that would emerge from the gray bundle , and the next moment , the Martian fell on the ground before us . <p> It burst out from the tarpaulin . It backed away from Pierre and from the light , a creature frightened and alone , and for several moments it made a metallic hissing noise as it slithered over the snow , searching for escape . At first , the hissing sounded like a rattlesnake 's warning , and several of us leapt back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For those who have never seen a Martian , it can be difficult to describe such a monstrosity . I have read descriptions , but none succeed . My recollections of this monster are imprinted as solidly as if they were etched on a lithographic plate , for this creature was both more than , and less than , the sum of all our nightmares . <p> Others have described the fungal green-gray hue of the creature 's bulbous head , fully five times larger than a human head , and they have told of the wet leathery skin that encases the Martian 's enormous brain . Others have described the peculiar slavering , sucking sounds that the creatures made as they gasped for breath , heaving convulsively as they groped about in our heavy atmosphere . <p> Others have described the two dumps of tentacles  --  eight in each clump , just below the lipless V-shaped beak , and they have told how the Gorgon tentacles coiled almost languidly as the creature slithered about . <p> The Martian invites comparison to the octopus or squid , for like these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentacles . Yet it is so much more than that ! <p> No one has described how the Martian was so exquisitely , so gloriously alive . The one Pierre had captured swayed back and forth , pulsing across the ice-crested snow with an ease that suggested that it was acclimated to polar conditions . While others have said that the creature seemed to them to be ponderously slow , I wonder if their specimens were not somehow hampered by warmer conditions  --  for this beast wriggled viciously , and its tentacles slithered over the snow like living whips , writhing not in agony  --  but in desperation , in a curious hunger . <p> Others have tried to tell what they saw in the Martian 's huge eyes : a marvelous intelligence , an intellect keen beyond measure , a sense of malevolence that some imagined to be pure evil . <p> Yet as I looked into that monster 's eyes , I saw all of those and more . The monster slithered over the snow at a deceptively quick pace , circling and twisting this way and that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . In its eyes was an undisguised hunger , a malevolent intent so monstrous that some hardened trappers cried out and turned away . <p> A dozen men pulled out weapons and hardly restrained themselves from opening fire . For a moment the Martian continued to hiss in that metallic grating sound , and I imagined it was some warning , till I realized that it was only the sound of the creature drawing crude breaths . <p> It sized up the situation , then sat gazing with evident maleficence at Pierre . The only sound was the gusting of wind over the tundra , the hiss of frozen snow stinging the ground , and my heart pounding . <p> Pierre laughed gleefully . " You see de situation , mah frien ' , " he addressed the Martian . " You wan ' to drink from me , but we have de guns trained on you . But dere ees blood to drink  --  blood from dogs ! " <p> The Martian gazed at Pierre with calculating hatred . I do not doubt it understood every word Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tongue as Pierre talked to it and his dogs on the lonely trail . It knew what we required of it . " Keel dem if you can , " Pierre admonished the creature . " Keel de dogs , drink from dem . If you ween , Ah weel set you free to fin ' your own kind . Ees simple , no ? " <p> The Martian expelled some air from its mouth in a gasp , an almost mechanical sound that can not adequately be described as speech . Yet the timing of that gasp , the pitch and volume , identified the beast 's intent as certain as any words uttered from human lips . " Yes , " it said . <p> Haltingly , with many a backward glance at us , the Martian slithered over the ground on its tentacles , entered the bear cage . Klondike Pete went to the winch and lifted the cage from the ground , while Tom King swiveled the boom out over the floor of the pit , then they lowered the cage . <p> The dogs sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . One-Eyed Kate 's pit bull , Grip , was a grayish creature the color of ash , and it leapt up at the cage as it lowered , growling and snapping once or twice , then caught the alien 's scent and backed away . <p> Others were not so circumspect . Klondike Pete 's dogs were veterans of the ring , used to fighting as a team , and their teeth snapped together with metallic clicks as we lowered the Martian into the pit . They jumped up , biting at the tentacles that recoiled from them . <p> When the cage hit the floor of the pit , Klondike Pete 's huskies snarled and danced forward , thrusting their teeth between the pine-wood bars at each side of the bear cage , trying to tear some flesh from the Martian before we pulled the rope that would open the door , freeing the Martian into the ring . <p> The dogs attacked from two sides at once , and if it had been a bear in that cage , it would have backed away from one dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . The Martian was not so easily abused . <p> It held calmly in the center of the cage for half a second , observing the dogs with those huge eyes , so full of malevolent wisdom . <p> Klondike Pete pulled the rope that would spring the door to the cage , releasing the Martian to the pack of dogs , and what happened next is almost too grisly to tell . <p> It has been said that Martians were ponderously slow , that they struggled under the effects of our heavier gravity . Perhaps that was true of them when they first landed , but this creature seemed to have acclimated to our gravity very well over the past few months . <p> It became , in an instant , a seething dynamo , a twisting , grisly mass of flesh bent on destruction . It hurled against one side of the cage , then another , and at first I believed it was trying to demolish the cage , break it asunder . Indeed , the Martian was roughly the size and weight of a small black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fight . I heard timbers crack under the monster 's onslaught , but it was not trying to break the bars of its cage . <p> It was not until after the Martian had hurled itself against the bars of its cage that I realized what had happened . Each of a Martian 's tentacles is seven feet long , and about three inches wide near the end . With several tentacles whipping snake-like in the air , striking in precision , the Martian had snatched through the bars and grabbed one husky , then another , and pulled , pinning the dogs helplessly against the sides of the bear cage where it held them firmly about their necks . <p> The huskies yelped and whined to find themselves in the Martian 's grasp , and straggled to pull away , desperately scratching at the beast 's tentacles with their forepaws , tugging backward with their considerable might . These were not your weak house dogs of New York or San Francisco . These were trained pack dogs that could drag a four hundred pound sled over the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would easily break free of the Martian 's grasp . <p> The door to the cage began to drop open , and with one tentacle , the Martian grasped it , twined the tentacle about the door , and held it closed as securely as if it were held by a steel lock , and in this manner it kept the other dogs somewhat at bay . <p> The other dogs barked and snarled . The pit bull lunged and experimentally nipped the tentacle that held the door closed , then danced back . One or two dogs howled , trotted around the pit , unsure how to proceed in their attacks . The pit bull struck again  --  once , twice  --  and was joined quickly by the others , and in a moment three dogs were snarling trying to rip that one tentacle free of the door . I saw flesh ripped away , and tender white skin , almost bloodless , was exposed . <p> The Martian seemed unconcerned . It was willing to sacrifice a limb in order to sate its appetite . Holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed . <p> It must be remembered that Pierre had held this Martian for nine days without food , and any human so ill-treated perhaps would also have sought refreshment before continuing the fight . It has also been reported that Martians drink blood , and that they used pipettes about a yard long to do so . From other accounts , one might suppose that such pipettes were metallic things that the Martians kept lying about near their vehicles , but this is not so . <p> Instead , from the Martian 's beak , a three-foot long rod telescoped , a rod that might have been a long white bone , except that it was twisted , like the horn of a narwhal , and its tip was hollow . <p> The Martian expertly inserted this bone into the jugular vein of the nearest husky , who yelped and snarled ferociously , trying to escape . <p> A loud , orgasmic slurping issued from the Martian , as if it were drinking sarsaparilla with an enormous straw . The dog 's death was amazingly swift . One moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow at its feet in its struggles to escape , and in the next it succumbed totally , horribly , and it slumped and quivered . <p> The tiniest fleck of blood dribbled from the husky 's throat as it ceased its frantic attempts at flight . <p> In thirty seconds , the feeding over , the Martian twisted with a snapping motion , inserted its horn into the second husky , and drank its blood swiftly . The whole process was carried out with horrid rapidness and precision , with as little thought as you or I might give to the process of chewing and swallowing an apple . <p> By now , the other dogs had gotten a good portion of the flesh on the Martian 's tentacle chewed away , and as the Martian fed upon the second of Klondike Pete 's prize-fighting huskies , the Martian struck with several tentacles , pummeling the dogs on their snouts , frightening them back a pace , where they snarled and leapt back and forth , seeking an opening . <p> The Martian stopped , regarded Klondike Pete balefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace toward him . The look in the creature 's eyes was chilling  --  a promise of what would happen to Klondike Pete if the Martian got free . <p> The Martian exhaled from its long white horn , and droplets of blood sprayed out over our faces . The sound that this exhalation  --  this almost automatic cleaning of the horn  --  made was most unsettling : it sounded as a trumpeting , ululating cry that rang through the night , slicing through the blizzard . It was a mournful sound , infinitely lonely in that dark setting . <p> At that moment , I felt small and mean to be standing here on the edge of the pit , urging the dogs to finish their business . For their part , the other six dogs backed away and studied the monster quietly , sniffing the air , wondering at this awe-inspiring sound that it made . <p> A biting gust of wind hit my face , and for the first time during that fight , I realized just how cold I was . The storm was blowing in warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days under the cloud cover . But the wind was brutal . It felt as if ice water were running in my veins , and the bitter weather drove the breath from me . I hunched against the cold , saw how the dogs quivered with anticipation in the pit , the breath steaming hot from their mouths . <p> I wanted to turn , rush inside to the warm stove , forget this grisly battle . But I was held by my own bloodlust , by my own quivering excitement . <p> There were six strong dogs in the ring , dogs bred to a life of toil . They growled and menaced and kept their distance , and the Martian retracted its horn back under that peculiar V-shaped beak , and flung open the doors of the bear cage , surging forward . Its appetite for blood had been sated , and now it was ready for battle . <p> In a pounding , quivering mass it rolled forward over the ice , staring into the eyes of the dogs . There was a look of undaunted majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature 's movements . " I am king here , " it was saying to the dogs . " I am all you aspire to be . You are fit only to be my food . " <p> With a coughing bark , Grip lunged for the Martian , its gray body leaping silent as a spectre over the snow . It jumped in the air , aiming a snapping bite at the Martian 's huge eye . I was almost forced to turn away . I did not want to see what happened when that pit bull 's monstrous , vise-like jaws bit into that dark flesh of the Martian 's eye . <p> In response , the Martian dropped down and under the dog with incredible speed . It became a whirling dynamo , a vortex , a living force of incredible power . Reaching up with three tentacles , it caught the pit bull by the neck in midair , then twisted and pulled down . There was an awful snapping as the pit bull hit ground , bounced twice . The pit bull slid a few feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panting and whining on the ice , unable to get up . <p> But the huskies were undaunted . These were the cousins to wolves , and their bloodlust , the primal memories passed through generations , overcame their fear . Four more dogs lunged and bit almost simultaneously , undaunted by the spectacle of strangeness and power before them . As they latched onto a tentacle , twisting , trying to rip and tear at the Martian as if it were some young caribou on the tundra , the Martian would convulse , pull its limb back rapidly , drawing each dog into its clutches . <p> In seconds , the Martian had four vicious , snarling dogs in its grasp , and its tentacles wound about their necks like a hangman 's ropes . <p> There was a flurry of activity , of frantic writhing and lunges on the parts of the dogs . The growls of attack became plaintive yelps of surprise and fear . The eager savage cries of battle became only a desperate pawing as the four worthy huskies , these brothers of the wolf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentacles to each dog , as a squid might grasp small fishes , and choked the fight and life from the dogs while we oggled in horrid fascination . <p> Soon the startled yelping , the labored breathing of dogs , the frantic tussle as the huskies sought escape , all became a stillness . Their heaving chests quieted . The wind blew softly through their gray hair . <p> The Martian sat atop them , slavering from its exertions , heaving and pulsating , glaring up at us . <p> One dog was left . Old Tom King 's husky , a valiant fighter that knew it was outmatched . It paced on the far side of the pit , whimpered up at us in shame . It was too smart to fight this strange monster . <p> Tom King hobbled over to the dog run , granted as he lift ed the gate that would let his dog escape the pit . Under normal circumstances , this act of mercy would not be allowed in such a fight , but these were anything but normal circumstances . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last canine . <p> Klondike Pete raised his 30-30 Winchester , aimed at the Martian 's head , right between its eyes . The Martian stared at us fiercely , without fear . " Kill me , " it seemed to say ; " It does not matter . I am but one of our kind . We will be back . " <p> " So , mah fren ' , " Pierre called to the Martian . " You have won your laif . As Ah promis , Ah weel let you go now . But mah companions here , " he waved expansively to the rest of us around the pit , " Ah no think weel be so generous , by Gar . Mah condolences to you ! " <p> He turned his back on the Martian , and I stared at the indomitable creature in the pit , lit only by the frantic wavering of our oil lamps . The storm was blowing , and the fierce cold gnawed at me , and for one moment , I wondered what it was like on Mars . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell like this land we had all exiled ourselves to . I imagined a warm house , a warm room , and I thought at how I , like the Martian , would do anything for one hour of heated solace . I would plot , steal , kill . Just as the Martian had done . <p> Time seemed to stop as Klondike Pete took aim , and I found myself croaking feebly , " Let it live . It won the right ! " <p> Everyone stopped . One-Eyed Kate peered from across the pit . Jim cocked his head and looked at me strangely . <p> The Martian turned its monstrously intelligent eyes on me , and gazed , it seemed , into my soul . For once there was no hunger in that gaze , no disconcerting look of malevolence . <p> What happened next , I can not explain , for words alone are inadequate to describe the sensation I received . There are those who assume that the Martians communicated through clicking sounds of their beaks , or through the waving of tentacles , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that no such sounds or motions were evident . Indeed , one reporter in London went so far as to suggest that they may have shared thoughts across space , communicating from one mind to another . Such suggestions have met with ridicule in critical circles , but I can only tell what happened to me : I was gazing into the pit , at the Martian , and suddenly it seemed as if a vast intelligence was pouring into my mind . For one brief moment , my thoughts seemed to expand and my intellect seemed to fill the universe , and I beheld a world with red blowing desert sands so strikingly cold that the sensation assaulted me like a physical blow , crumpling me so that I fell down into the snow , curling into a ball . And as I beheld this world , I looked through eyes that were not my own . All of the light was tremendously magnified and shifted toward the red spectrum , so that I beheld the landscape as if on some strange summer evening when the sky shone more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was peculiarly concave , as if I were staring at a world much smaller than ours . <p> A few red plants sprouted in this frigid waste , but they were stunted things . Martian cities  --  walking things that traveled through great maze-like canyons as they followed the sun from season to season  --  were marching in the distance , tantalizing , gleaming . I craved their warmth , the company of my Martian companions . I hungered for warmth , as a starving man might hunger for food in the last moments of life . <p> And above me , floating like a mote of dust in the sea of space , was the shining planet Earth . <p> One . We are one , a voice seemed to whisper in my head , and I knew that the Martian , with its superior intellect , had deigned speak to me . You understand me . We are one . <p> Then above me  --  for I had fallen to the ground under the weight of this extraordinary vision  --  a rifle cracked , the sound of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete cocked the gun and fired three more times , and the stinging scent of gunpowder and burnt oil from the barrel of his gun filled the air . <p> I got up and looked into the pit at the Martian . It was wriggling in its death throes , twisting and heaving on the ground in its inhuman way . <p> Everyone stood in the freezing , pelting snow , watching it die . I looked behind me , and even Doctor Weatherby had come out to witness the monster 's demise . <p> " Right then , I say , " he muttered . " Well , it 's done . " <p> I got up , brushed the snow from me , and looked down into the pit . Tom King was watching me with rheumy eyes that glittered in the lamplight . He pulled at his beard and cackled . " ' Let ' t live , ' says he ! " He tumed away and chuckled under his breath . " Young whippersnapper thinks he know everything  --  but he do n't know gol ' - durned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm lodge for the night , and in moments I was forced to follow . <p> That was on the night of January 13 , 1900 . As far as I know , I was among the last people on Earth to see a living Martian . In warmer climes , they had all passed away months before , during that hot August . And even as we suffered that night through the grim storm , the huge walking city in Anchorage began a tedious trek north , and was never seen again . Its tracks indicate that it came to the frozen ocean , tried to walk across , and sank into the sea . Many believe that there the Martians drowned , while others wonder if perhaps this had been the Martians ' intended destination all along , and so we are forced to wonder if the Martians are even now living in cities under the frozen polar ice , waiting to return . <p> But on the night I speak of , none of us at Hidden Lodge knew what would happen in months to come . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nearness of the creature , or perhaps because of our own feelings of guilt for what we had done , we feared more than ever an ignoble death in the tentacles of the Martians . <p> After we had warmed ourselves for a few moments in the lodge , the men all scurried away . Doctor Weatherby agreed to accompany me to my cabin under the cover of the storm , so that he might look in on Bessie . More than anything else , it was her need that had driven me to the lodge this night . <p> We left Hidden Lodge during the middle of the storm , let the snows cover our trails until we reached the cabin . We found Bessie gone from the cabin . The front door was open , and an armload of wood lay on the floor just inside . I knew then that the Martians had gotten her , had snatched her as she tried to warm herself . I tramped through the snow until I found her frozen , bloodless corpse not far outside the cabin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under cover of darkness , and burying her deep in the snow , where the wolves would not find her . I did not care if the Martians took me . Almost , I wanted it . <p> The storm had passed . The Arctic night was brutally cold , the stars piercingly bright . The aurora borealis flickered green on the northern horizon in a splendid display , and after I buried Bessie , I stood in the snow for a long hour , looking up . <p> Doctor Weatherby must have worried at why I stayed out for so long , for he came out and put his hands on my shoulders , then stared up into the night sky . <p> " I say , there it is  --  is n't it ? Mars ? " He was staring farther south than I had been watching , apparently believing that I was studying events elsewhere in the heavens . I had never been one to study the skies . I did not know where Mars lay . It stared down at us , like a baleful red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week to care for me . It was an odd time . I was brooding silent . On the woodpile , the good Doctor set out petri dishes full of agar to the open air . Small colored dots of bacteria were growing in each dish , and by watching these , he hoped to discover precisely what species of bacteria were destroying the Martians . He insisted that cultures of such bacteria might provide an overwhelming defense in future wars . I was intrigued by this , and somehow , of all the things that happened that winter , my numbed mind remembers those green splotches of mold and bacteria better than just about anything else . <p> After the doctor left , it was the most difficult time of my life . I had no food , no warmth , no comfort during the remainder of that winter . Sometimes I wished the Martians would take me , even as I struggled to stay alive . <p> Before the end of the cold weather , I was forced to eat my dogs , and ultimately boil the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . I struggled from day to day under each successive frozen blast from the north . <p> I managed to live . <p> And slowly , haltingly , like the march of an old and enfeebled man , after the lean winter , came a chill spring . <p> <p> By Dave Wolverton <p>
