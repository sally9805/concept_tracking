Six months earlier . In the rugged Corsican hills above the waters of Porto Vecchio on the Tyrrhenian Sea , there stood the skeletal remains of a once-majestic estate . The exterior stonework , built to stand for centuries , was by and large intact , the insides of the various structures destroyed , gutted by fire decades ago . It was midafternoon , the skies dark , heavy rain imminent as a late-winter storm made its way up the coast from Bonifacio . Soon the air and the earth would be drenched , mud everywhere , the overgrown , barely visible paths around the great house to be slogged through , not walked over . " I would suggest that we hurry , padrone , " said the heavyset Corsican in a hooded parka . " The roads back to the Senetosa airfield are difficult enough without the storm , " he added in accented English , the language mutually agreed upon . " Senetosa can wait , " replied the slender man in a raincoat , his speech betraying a Netherlands origin . " Everything can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey map for the north property , if you please . " The Corsican reached into his pocket and withdrew a many-folded sheaf of heavy paper . He gave it to the man from Amsterdam , who rapidly unfolded it , placed it against a stone wall , and anxiously studied it . He kept turning his gaze away from the map , looking over at the area that momentarily consumed his attention . The rain began , a drizzle that quickly became a steady shower . " Over here , padrone , " cried the guide from Bonifacio , pointing at an archway in the stone wall . It was the entrance to a long-ago garden arbor of sorts , odd insofar as the arch itself was barely four feet wide while its thickness was nearly six feet -- tunnel-like , strange . It was overgrown with vines crawling up the sides , strangling the entrance -- forbidding . Still , it was a refuge from the sudden downpour . The " padrone , " a man in his early forties , dashed into the small sanctuary , immediately pressing the unfolded map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt marker from his raincoat pocket and circled a wide area . " This section , " he yelled to be heard over the pounding rain hitting the stone , " it must be roped off , sealed off , so that no one enters it or disturbs it in any way ! Is that clear ? " " If that is your order , it is done . But , padrone , you 're talking about a hundred or so acres . " " Then that is my order . My representatives will check constantly to make sure it 's carried out . " " That is not necessary , sir , I shall carry it out . " " Good , fine , do so . " " And the rest , grande signore ? " " As we discussed in Senetosa . Everything must be precisely duplicated from the original plans as recorded in Bastia two hundred years ago , updated , of course , with modern conveniences . Whatever you need will be supplied by my ships and cargo aircraft in Marseilles . You have the numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accomplish what I ask of you -- demand from you -- and you can retire a wealthy man , your future secure . " " It is a privilege to have been chosen , padrone . " " And you understand the need for absolute secrecy ? " " Naturalmente , padrone ! You are an eccentric Bavarian man of immense riches who cares to live out his life in the magnificent hills of Porto Vecchio . That is all anyone knows ! " " Good , fine . " " But if I may , grande signore , we stopped in the village and the old woman who runs that decrepit inn saw you . In truth , she fell to her knees in the kitchen and gave thanks to the Savior that you had come back . " " What ? " " If you recall , when our refreshments were so long in coming , I went into the cucina and found her in very loud prayers . She wept as she spoke , saying that she could tell by your face , your eyes . The Barone di Matarese has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Corsican spoke the name as it was in Italian , Mataresa . " She thanked the Lord God that you had come back , that greatness and happiness would return to the mountains . " " That incident must be erased from your memory , do you understand me ? " " Of course , sir . I heard nothing ! " " To the reconstruction . It must be completed in six months . Spare nothing , just do it . " " I will endeavor to do my best . " " If your best is not good enough , you 'll have no retirement , wealthy or otherwise , capisce ? " " I do , padrone , " said the Corsican , swallowing . " As to the old woman at the inn --  " " Yes ? " " Kill her . " Six months and twelve hysterical days passed , and the great estate of the Matarese dynasty was restored . The results were remarkable , as only many millions of dollars could ensure . The great house with its massive banquet hall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , chandeliers replacing the enormous candelabrum , and the modern amenities , such as running water , toilets , air-conditioning , and , naturally , electricity , reproduced throughout . The grounds were cleared , the sodded grass around the main house allowing for a large croquet course and a challenging putting green . The long entrance from the road to Senetosa had been paved , submerged grass lamps lighting the way at night , and well-dressed attendants greeted all vehicles as they approached the marble steps of the entrance . What visitors did not know was that each attendant was a professional guard , in the main , former commandos from various countries . Each palmed an electronic scanner that would detect weapons , cameras , or recorders within three meters ; in essence , they could expose such objects from a distance of two feet . The orders were clear . Should anyone arrive with these items , he or she was to be forcibly detained and taken to an interrogation room where harsh questions would be asked . If the answers were unsatisfactory , there was equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable responses . The Matarese was back , in all its questionable power and glory . It was dusk , the hills of Porto Vecchio fired by the setting sun , when the limousines began arriving . The Armani-suited guards greeted the visitors solicitously , helping each from a vehicle courteously with hands that unobtrusively roamed over their clothing . There were seven outsized cars , seven guests ; there would be no more . Six men and one woman , ranging in ages from their early thirties to their middle fifties , a mix of nationalities with one thing in common -- all were immensely rich . Each was ushered up the marble steps of the Villa Matarese where the individual guards led them to the banquet hall . A long table was in the center of the huge room , place cards in front of the seven chairs , four on the right , three on the left , no one closer than five feet from another guest . At the head of the table was an empty chair ; a small lectern stood in front of it . Two uniformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls of beluga caviar were at each place setting , and the muted strains of a Bach fugue subtly filled the room . Quiet conversations began haltingly , as though none of the guests understood the reason for this gathering . Yet , again , there was a common denominator : All spoke English and French , so both languages were employed , finally narrowed down to the former , as the two male Americans were neither especially quick nor sufficiently comfortable with the latter tongue . The badinage was inconsequential , reduced to who knew whom and was n't the weather glorious in St. Tropez , or the Bahamas , Hawaii , or Hong Kong ? None dared to ask the essential question : Why are we here ? Six men and one woman were frightened people . They had reason to be . There was more in their individual pasts than the present suggested . Suddenly , the music stopped . The massive chandeliers were dimmed as a small spotlight emerged from the railing of the balcony , growing brighter as it shone down on the lectern at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of an alcove and moved slowly into light and the lectern . His pleasant if dismissible face looked pale under the glare , but his eyes were not to be dismissed . They were alive and steady , centering briefly on each person as he nodded to each in turn . " I thank you all for accepting my invitation , " he began , his voice an odd mixture of ice and repressed heat . " I trust your traveling accommodations were in the style to which you are accustomed . " There was a murmur of affirmatives , although hardly enthusiastic . " I realize , " continued the man from Amsterdam , " that I interrupted your lives , both social and professional , but I had no choice . " " You have it now , " interrupted the lone woman coldly . She was in her thirties and dressed in an expensive black dress with a string of pearls that bespoke at least fifty thousand dollars , American . " We 're here , now tell us why . " " I apologize , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the Rancho Mirage in Palm Springs for an assignation with your current husband 's partner in his extortionist brokerage firm . I 'm sure your absence will be overlooked , as there would be no firm had you not financed it . " " I beg your pardon ! " " Please , madam , I 'm uncomfortable with beggars . " " Speaking for myself , " said a middle-aged , balding Portuguese , " I 'm here because you implied that I could be in serious difficulty if I did not appear . Your coded allusion was not lost on me . " " My cable merely mentioned the name Azores . ' Apparently it was enough . The consortium you head is fraught with corruption , the bribes to Lisbon are blatantly criminal . Should you control the Azores , you control not only the incessantly excessive airline fees but the excise taxes of over a million tourists a year . Well thought out , I 'd say . " There was an eruption of voices on both sides of the table , some hinting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seven coming to the hidden estate in Porto Vecchio . " Enough , " said the man from Amsterdam , raising his voice . " You mistake why you are here . I know more about each one of you than you know about yourselves . It is my legacy , my inheritance -- and you are all inheritors . We are the descendants of the Matarese , the font from whom all your wealth derives . " The seven visitors were stunned , a number glancing at each other as if an unspeakable thing bonded them to one another . " That 's not a name we use or refer to , I should n't think , " said an Englishman in the sartorial splendor of Savile Row . " Neither my wife nor my children have ever heard it , " he added softly . " Why bring it up ? " asked a Frenchman . " The Matarese is long gone -- dead and forgotten , a distant memory to be buried . " " Are you dead ? " said the Hollander . " Are you buried ? I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnacle of financial influence . All of you lead , by name or in absentia , major corporations and conglomerates , the very essence of the Matarese philosophy . And each of you was chosen by me to fulfill the Matarese destiny . " " What goddamned destiny ? " asked one of the Americans , his accent from the Deep South . " You some kinda Huey Long ? " " Hardly , but your casino interests along the Mississippi River might suggest that you are . " " My operations are as clean as they have to be , buddy-boy ! " " I relish your modifier --  " " What destiny ? " broke in another American . " The name Matarese never appeared in any legal documentation relative to the real-estate interests bequeathed to my family . " " I 'd be appalled if it had , sir . You 're the leading attorney at a major bank in Boston , Massachusetts . Harvard Law School , magna cum laude ... and part of the most bribery-prone institution that ever sucked money by way of compromising state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your talents . " " You ca n't prove any such thing . " " Do n't tempt me , Counselor -- you 'd lose . However , I did not bring all of you to Porto Vecchio merely to parade the thoroughness of my inquiries , although I concede they 're a part of the whole . The carrot and the stick , as it were .... First let me introduce myself . I am Jan van der Meer Matareisen , and I 'm sure the last name has meaning for you . I am a direct descendant of the Baron of Matarese ; he was , in fact , my grandfather . As you may or may not know , the Baron 's liaisons were held secret , and whatever offspring resulted were also kept secret . However , the great man in no way abandoned his responsibilities . His issue was sent to the finest families throughout Italy , France , England , Portugal , America , and , as I can attest , the Netherlands . " The visitors were again dumbstruck . Slowly , gradually , their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , penetratingly , as if some extraordinary secret was about to be revealed . " What the hell are you gettin ' at ? " said the large , coarse American from Louisiana . " Spell it out , boy ! " " I agree , " added the man from London , " what 's your point , old man ? " " I believe several of you are already ahead of me , " said Jan van der Meer Matareisen , permitting himself the trace of a smile . " Then say it , Dutchman ! " demanded the entrepreneur from Lisbon . " Very well , I shall . Like myself , you are all children of those children . We are the products of the same loins , as the English bard might have phrased it . Each and every one of you is a blood descendant of the Baron of Matarese . " The audience exploded as one with phrases such as " We 've heard of the Matarese , but nothing like this ! " and " That 's preposterous ! My family was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me ! I 'm a natural blond , not a trace of the Mediterranean in me ! " The protestations grew in volume until the protectors ran out of breath , finally subsiding as Jan Matareisen raised his hands under the shaft of light . " I can answer your assaults specifically , " he said calmly , " if you will but listen .... The Baron 's appetites were fierce and varied , as he was . Your grandmothers were brought to him as if they were the whims of an Arabian sheikh ; none , however , was defiled , for all accepted him for the extraordinary man he was . But I , and only I , was the legitimate child in the eyes of the Church . He married my grandmother . " " What the hell are we ? " yelled the American from New Orleans . " Bastards goin ' back two generations ? " " Have you ever lacked for funds , sir ? For education or investment . " " No ... ca n't say that I have . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful woman , a model whose face and figure graced such publications as Vogue and Vanity Fair , is that not so ? " " I reckon , although she does n't talk about it much . " " She did n't have to . She quickly married an insurance executive whose company expanded to the point where he was made president . " " You 're not only suggesting , but you 're also actually stating , that we 're all related ! " cried the attorney from Boston . " What proof do you have ? " " Buried six feet in the earth on the northeast acreage of this property was a small vault , an oilcloth packet inside . It took me five months to find it . In the oilcloth were the names of the Baron 's children and their new homelands . He was , if nothing else , precise in all things .... Yes , my Bostonian guest , we are all related . We are cousins , whether we like it or not . Collectively , we are the inheritors of the Matarese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath suspended . " My Gawd ! " said the American from the Deep South . " Why do I have the feeling that if we did , we 'd never reach the road to Senetosa ? " mused the woman . " You ascribe to me more than I ascribe to myself , madam . " " Go ahead , Jan van der Meer Matareisen , visions are my business , " said the cardinal . " Then envision this , Priest , " said Matareisen . " We have a schedule , a countdown , if you like . Only a few months away , the beginning of the New Year . That is our target for global control , Matarese control . "
