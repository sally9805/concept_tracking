On This Untamed Stretch of Central California Coastline , Dreamers and Dropouts Have Claimed A Corner of Paradise <p> The people who live in the Big Sur country divide the people who drop off Highway 1 to see them into two distinctly identifiable categories . <p> There are the tourists , who complain that there are no telephones or televisions in the motel rooms and who say , as they wait at the gas pump , Where exactly is all this wonderful scenery everyone keeps talking about , all I see is trees . <p> And there are the visitors , who stand and look around , and after a while they see a wisp of white fog coming up a dark gully as a faint mixed scent of kelp and yerba buena floats through the air . Or there is a giant condor circling overhead , or a sea otter scraping mussels off a rock in the spray on the beach at the foot of a thousand-foot cliff , or a whale spouting out in the endless Pacific , and they say , There is something magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be a severe technical term , is now an all-purpose word meaning anything distinctly out of the ordinary . And as such , it is a perfectly accurate descriptive word for Big Sur . There is nothing precisely like it on this planet . <p> Everyone who has ever got beyond the tourist stage on this narrow 75-mile stretch of central California coast , running just south of Monterey to Carmel , and nearly to San Simeon , has at some time had the feeling , exhilarating or uneasy or simply puzzled , of being on an edge . The Oh lone Indians , who lived just north of here for hundreds , perhaps thousands of years , have left behind them a song of which the refrain is " Dancing on the edge of the world . " <p> You find yourself always on the edge in Big Sur , on the edge of cliffs plunging down into the sea , on the edge of California where the bungalows and the billboards stop at last , on the edge of the United States where the bustling contrapuntal progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pacific Ocean . <p> Geologically speaking , the Big Sur country is not part of the United States at all . It is the cutting edge of the Pacific Tectonic Plate , one of the dozen or so components of the current crust of planet Earth , which for the past 29 million years has been grinding its way northwestward against the edge of the North American Plate , causing fearful landslides and earthquakes as it goes , at approximately the speed of a growing human fingernail . <p> No wonder that the land bears everywhere the imprint of chaos , rock layers twisted and bent like the limbs of photographer Edward Weston 's cypress , the kind of tree that " the sailor wind works into deep-sea knots , " says the poet Robinson Jeffers . No wonder there is an extraordi nary jumble of vegetation here : redwood from the damp northern forests growing across the hill from yucca of the southern deserts , tan oak and sycamore and willow and big-leaf maple and madrona , and the Santa Lucia fir , which is found nowhere else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway ( one authority has counted 344 species of tree and shrub and grass squeezed into one patch of 4,000 acres ) . Nowhere else will you see such a range of the color green in a narrow strip of landscape , from the pale absinthe of denuded hilltops to the terrible dark of cliffside gorges . <p> The climate here is technically known as Mediterranean , with wet winters and dry summers and reasonably moderate temperatures the year round , more pleasant than the Mediterranean itself because cold water rising out of offshore sea canyons thousands of feet deep breeds fogs-which tends to annoy the tourists . But the fogs also temper the summer heat and help keep down the fires that periodically threaten to destroy every living thing between the mountaintops and the sea . <p> It is a richly tormented landscape that never was , and never will be , fit for large-scale human habitation . And for all but a brief recent flicker of time , sensible humans have carefully avoided it . <p> Anyone who has ever come to Big Sur , says Esther Ewoldsen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , has been running away from something , whether the law or their family or their creditors . The Esselen Indians retreated here 2,000 years ago , forced to share the game of the rugged countryside with the grizzly bears , and the limpets and mussels clinging for dear life to the tidal rocks , with the pelicans . In colonial days , when it was known as el pais grande del sur , " the big country of the south , " meaning the inaccessible stretch of coast south of the provincial capital of Alta California at Monterey , it was a dark trackless wilderness , where outlaws hid out from service in the armed forces of Spain and Mexico , as draft-dodgers would later hide out from the American Army during the Vietnam War . Smugglers quartered here , and trappers like Jedediah Smith , who , after they had exterminated the beavers from the Rocky Mountain country for the European hat trade , came here to hunt the sea otters prowling the coastal waters . ( Those creatures were to be saved from being exterminated themselves only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinct . ) <p> For a brief period toward the end of the 19th century , there was some logging of tan oaks to provide tannic acid for the leather trade , some gold mining , some quarrying of limestone , but nothing remains of them except a few scars on the landscape . Adventurous voyagers might drop by , like Robert Louis Stevenson , who used the scenery as a backdrop for the tale of Treasure Island , which he was making up for his stepson . A few hardy souls got their 160 acres under the Homestead Act of 1862 and tried with difficulty to make a living by farming or ranching on what small amounts of relatively level ground were available among all the cliffs and arroyos . <p> It was still a lost world when the young poet Robinson Jeffers came down to Big Sur with his bride , Una , in 1914 . There was no paved road on the 40-mile stretch from Monterey to the tiny village of Big Sur , and it took all day to cover it in a horse-drawn coach . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had already been strong storms that winter and at Soberanes Creek the cypress trees around the farmhouse were blown to pieces . Sea- lions roared on the Lobos Rocks off shore , while the man of the house told us that last night his hundred-pound grindstone , which he kept by the back door , had been blown around the house to the front steps ; here it lay . In the gorge of Mill Creek we changed horses , near a lonely farmhouse where an eighty-year-old man lay dying ; he was dying hard , he had been dying for a week . On a magnificent hillside opposite a mountain-peak stood a comparatively prosperous farmhouse , apple trees behind it , and the man who lived there had killed his father with rat-poison and married his step-mother . There were only five or six inhabitants in forty miles , but each one had a story . We came down to the Sur River , and passed the albino redwood that still grows there , shining in the forest darkness , shoots of snow-white fo liage growing from the stump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but strange enough to be . " <p> All of what was to be the world of the Jeffers poetry was there , the awesome scenery , the melodramatic tales of the torn and twisted souls stranded in it , the sense of a brooding danger , the sense , above all , that this was the end , the final point in both time and space of Western civilization . <p> Jeffers was to be the harbinger and bard for the still-continuing wave of runaways to hit Big Sur , the refugees from the materialistic , consumeristic culture of modern America . <p> In his daily life , Jeffers was a handsome , charming and talented man . He left a physical monument in the form of his house and looming tower . He built the tower by hand , by himself , out of huge boulders eroded from the cliffside by the giant waves that daily crash against the shore . From the beginning , it has been a shrine for his admirers , who in his lifetime ranged from Charlie Chaplin and Charles Lindbergh to George Gershwin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient Greek tragedians . It was meant to stand in magnificent isolation , dominating acres of wild land beside the pounding sea , but it is now just one more dwelling among many behind hedges on a quiet street in what has now become the tasteful , gallery-rich community of Carmel-by-the-Sea . Visitors file through it in silence as they file through museums ; they see the room in the tower where the poet paced to the sullen beat of the waves as he composed his lines . <p> " Walk on gaunt shores and avoid the people " was his advice to the world . And Jeffers enjoyed the company of his contemporaries , heirs to the Romantic tradition , who turned their backs on it all . Those poets and painters of the San Francisco Bay region , by the opening of the 20th century , found themselves strangling in the conformist and hypocritical atmosphere in what had once been the wide-open world of the forty-niners . ( As late as 1946 , my friend C. F. McIntyre , translator of French poets , was , or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California at Berkeley because he insisted on wearing a beret . ) <p> Led by George Sterling , the poet laureate of San Francisco , they built themselves little cabins or houses in the wasteland near the ruins of the 18th-century Carmel mission . <p> Life in Carmel might be noisily cheerful-one of its chroniclers refers to it as a perpetual beach party-but there was always an undertow of dissatisfaction . As the critic Van Wyck Brooks , who spent a year with all the geniuses at Carmel , observed , nobody ever seemed to get any work done . And several of their leading figures , including Sterling and his wife , ended by swallowing the cyanide tablets they carried everywhere in their pockets-a practice made fashionable by a poet named Nora May French , who prepared a poisoned sandwich for a man who had spurned her love-but a dog got it first , and she swallowed the rest of the powder out of sheer spite . <p> While the scattered shacks , put up as so many temples to Art , were soon to be swallowed up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a wasteland , with only a few gruff loners willing to settle down on the edges of cliffs or up in the deep , damp dark of gorges . Then , in the early 1920s , the state of California , empowered to build a road for potential defense purposes , and just perhaps suspecting that it had a tourist mecca on its hands , began to construct Highway 1 ( Smithsonian , June 1999 ) along the cliff edges , over bridges spanning the torrents , through the groves , skirting the steep mountain meadows . They used convict labor for the job , and it was hard work . The road was not finished for 16 years , and then the Depression and World War II , with its gas rationing , took people 's minds off the scenic coast of central California . Electricity and telephone lines were slow to follow . It was not until 1958 when William Randolph Hearst 's castle of San Simeon was opened to the public that the great flood of tourist vehicles that had been anticipated began to flow along Highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out intermediaries , to buy all the private property in the Big Sur country . He intended to make it into a vast estate , on the order of William the Conqueror 's New Forest , where he could lead cavalcades of celebrity guests and retainers from one hunting camp to another , but he ran out of funds . Other , less ambitious , immigrants were meanwhile slipping in , people who had felt the lure of this distant , isolated land : rich people looking for quiet vacation homes , veterans looking to escape their memories of war , Hollywood people looking for hideaways , artistic people looking for secret places where their genius could flower , ordinary people looking for jobs as carpenters or waitresses , loners and drifters and derelicts looking for a quiet cleft or cranny outside the whirring machine of American life , every one of them looking for something different , out of the ordinary , magic . <p> Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth , driving along Highway 1 , fell in love with and bought a little log cabin on a ledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found time to come back , and the cabin eventually came into the hands of a man named Bill Fassett who had drifted his way all across the country from Tennessee . He would eventually expand it into what became a restaurant , which he called Nepenthe , a Greek word that can be translated into the vernacular as " no sorrow . " <p> Nepenthe would soon become , as it has remained ever since , the social and symbolic center of the Big Sur country life . " There was dancing every night in those days , " says Fassett 's daughter Holly , now matriarch of the clan still running the place . " And such friendly , unusual people . Of course , when some of them started throwing tables at each other , I had to eighty-six them . But mostly it was just eat and drink , talk and dance , dance dance dance all night long . " <p> The most notable of the new immigrants was Henry Miller-bunked down for a while in one of the road-building convicts ' cabins-who had turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most banned of all authors . His Tropic of Cancer , that marvelously high-spirited chronicle of fraternity-boy sex on the Left Bank , first printed in 1935 , had been greeted by Ezra Pound with the memorable sound bite , " At last an unprintable book that is fit to read . " For many years , that title was to provide American customs officers with ample employment on the docks of New York , searching the baggage of returning voyagers for copies of the vile work disguised in innocent wrappers as the work of Hans Christian Andersen or Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen . It was not until 1961 that a memorable judiciary decision enabled works of fiction like Tropic of Cancer , dealing matter-of-factly with sex , to get back into the mainstream of literature where they had swum in the days of Chaucer and Boccaccio . <p> Royalties made Miller a rich man before he died in 1980 . But he had not come to Big Sur to make money . He had come , like the outlaws of old , to live in simple comfort in an earthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He had a wonderful time . It was " one big party , " in the summing up of Ephraim Doner , an artist who was an indefatigable companion in those days . <p> Henry Miller spent his whole life creating in more than 250 books and tens of thousands of letters a character called Henry Miller who was a wild man , a rebel , a subverter and perverter of all standards , codes and conformities , waging a war to the death against modern civilization and especially the American form of it , which he described in a book called The Air-Conditioned Nightmare . He was a genial , gentle , gregarious man , the greatest man there ever was to have a series of drinks with . He had a unique talent for depending on the kindness of strangers and friends to take care of him , and for generously repaying them when he had the time and the cash in his pockets . He discovered in Big Sur what Alexander Solzhenitsyn would discover in a village in Vermont : a community of independent , self-reliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people going their own individual , sometimes eccentric way , who would not dream of meddling in the affairs of their neighbors , but would do anything to help them out in an emergency . <p> Among them he had 18 sybaritic years . After the daily long hours at his desk-he was a speed typist who could and did turn out thousands upon thousands of words a day-there were always the hot baths or Nepenthe to go to , and endless jolly conversations with the endless succession of neighbors , old friends from Europe , young admirers from America , wives , aspiring writers , wild girls of the road , and curious tourists who found the way up the tortuous dirt road that led to his house on Partington Ridge . <p> Eventually , though , he repaired to the tony Los Angeles suburb of Pacific Palisades , where he would spend the last 18 years of his life ensconced in a columned and porticoed mansion , complete with heated swimming pool and air conditioning . <p> This is hardly a vision shared by the other inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , have spent a good part of their time fighting to keep out developers and other forces of progress that would turn them into a Pacific Palisades . An impossible dream , but one that has been more successful than might have been foretold . <p> Tucked away in big houses in leafy glens or on rocky promontories , there grew up a little kernel of rich and famous and powerful people , pa - trician diplomats like Nicholas Roosevelt , famous architects like Nathaniel Owings and Philip Johnson , Nobel Prize winners like Linus Pauling , show business celebrities like Kim Novak and Allen Funt , creator of Candid Camera , billionaires like Ted Turner and David Packard . And these were people whose voice could carry as far as the California State Legislature , which in the 1960s and ' 70s passed laws protecting the scenic beauty of Highway 1 and providing that no buildings could be visible from the Big Sur section of the road . <p> And so , to this day , you can drive all the miles of two-lane highway through the narrow valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single billboard or movie theater or shopping mall or golf course . <p> It is still the kind of place where you can live for years without attracting too much curiosity or attention , where one man did live quietly for years and was regarded as a good neighbor , till someone saw his picture on television , where he was identified as being wanted for murder . <p> Apart from the highway , there still are only a few paved roads ; for one stretch of 30 miles or so , there is no electric power except from solar collectors and a handful of generators . The hawks and kingfishers are still around , and muscular jays will steal your hamburger if you are n't watchful . On any night you may find a mountain lion come down to sniff at your door . Lupine and poppies gaily carpet the mountain meadows . <p> Only a few purists worry about the intrusion of alien animals and plants . They denounce the wild pigs ( im ported in the 1920s from Europe for hunting purposes ) for digging up vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose out of the sea two million years ago ; and " foreign weeds " like pampas grass , imported from South America as a decorative plant , for aggressively displacing the more quiet native flowers . <p> ( It is easier to sympathize with the complaints against another immigrant , genista , or French broom , a plant much prized for its yellow flowers by tourists who are unaware that this fast-growing weed pushes up past the slower-growing poison oak , the most common shrub in California , and absorbs some of its essential oil on the way , with the result that picking nosegays for your beloved may leave you covered for weeks with agonizing sores . ) <p> Saving the physical presence was only half the battle . The question remained , how to preserve the spiritual essence of the place , the sense of the pristine , the primitive , the lawless , the wild ? With a million cars carrying curious sightseers up and down the highway each year , it was impossible to prevent a transformation of Big Sur society . Where once the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population ( which varies with the seasons be tween 1,500 and 2,000 ; the coastal Indians are said to have numbered 1,200 at their peak ) is dependent on the tourist trade , or hospitality industry as it is now called-cooks , waiters , bartenders , chambermaids , clerks in gift shops and art galleries , designers , photographers , park rangers . With the acute shortage of housing and with rents at Manhattan levels , some of them have to commute 50 miles and more to their work . <p> And to keep up with the times , this community is wired . Many people who used to own vacation homes , which they occupied for a few weeks and rented out the rest of the year , have discovered that computers allow them to conduct their business from their living rooms . They go to the city on occasion to sign contracts . <p> There are still some folks of the old school-no one knows exactly how many-who live more or less anonymously in ramshackle structures in the woods , on land they bought when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring today . <p> Orrin Winton , one of the hardy band of year-round unauthorized campers-he was the one who found in a trackless canyon the bones of a girl hiker who had been missing for three years , but he did n't notify anyone of his discovery for five months because he does n't like his privacy to be intruded on-could until recently be seen occasionally plugging his laptop into the pay phone beside the post office . There , he accesses his Website , devoted to his family genealogy and to the subject of antenna design for amateur radio operators . He sees himself as a last stand against both the state authorities and the private enterprise system , which he feels are ganging up against the dropout . <p> The Forest Service will not authorize anyone to live in the woods for more than two weeks ; restaurant owners will no longer leave their garbage where it can be picked over in dumpsters . Orrin Winton has , however , lived successfully alone in the wilderness , equipped with an all-weather plastic-coated tent , a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the past 7 1/2 years . <p> The freezing out of the dropouts has made for a quieter , gentler and somewhat more conventional Big Sur . There is still dancing at Nepenthe , but only once a month . There are still artists and artisans in Big Sur , scores of them , but they no longer live in shacks without refrigerators or running water and peddle their wares to motor ists on the highway . They have studios , some of them very elaborate studios , and they sell their works in gall eries . You can view their works in venues as various as the boardrooms of Fortune 500 companies and the George Bush Presidential Library . <p> There is a certain nostalgia for the wild old days of 30 and 40 years ago , which began up in San Francisco , where visions of Henry Miller , the wild prophet of sex and anarchy , mingled in the minds of restless young people with the knowledge that there were no resident policemen down there , only a patrol car that drove through , going south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They came in all shapes and sizes : Beat poets like Jack Kerouac , folk - singers , high school kids plotting rev olution in Redwood City and Walnut Grove , deadbeats and petty thieves of the type described at great length in a cult classic by Richard Brautigan called A Confederate General from Big Sur , all fleeing from the stifling standardized air of the commercial culture , all singing the anthem of Woody Guthrie , " This land belongs to you and me . " They spread up the creeks and through the forests , uprooting the " No Trespassing " signs , chopping down trees for their campfires , bedding down under the stars in fields of poison oak or in abandoned cars , in continuous celebration of drink , drugs , sex , Zen , liberty , folk music , rock music and everything else that came under the general heading of Love . <p> The older inhabitants were outraged by the noise and the strewing of garbage ; Henry Miller referred to all those disciples of his as " locusts . " But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would provide the publicity that would put Big Sur on the American map . In the long run , says one of the motel owners , they ended up being good for business . <p> A Dr. Henry C. Murphy in Salinas ( he delivered the baby John Steinbeck ) had purchased 165 acres of wooded cliff-top land a few miles south of the village of Big Sur , including some hot springs that had cured Indians and pioneers of arthritis . He built bathhouses there with the idea of creating a therapeutic spa . <p> From this point , fact erodes and legend proliferates . As one story goes , when Murphy heard that some young rowdies from San Francisco were coming down on moonlit nights for wild rompings , which were de stroying his buildings and defacing the environment , he sent orders to the caretaker of his house nearby . Murphy instructed that fierce-looking young man from Missouri , who happened to be named Hunter S. Thompson , to get rid of them . Thompson armed himself with a shotgun , formed a posse , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one midnight through the solitary trail that led to the hot springs . " They were plenty loud up there , " says one of the purveyors of local folklore , " but the Dobermans must have been louder , because when they got there , there was nobody left , and they 've never been since , though how they got away without jumping 450 feet into the ocean nobody knows . " <p> After this Night of the Dobermans , Dr. Murphy came down to express his satisfaction , and found the walls and ceilings of his home full of buckshot , and fired his caretaker . <p> In time , the property came into the hands of Dr. Murphy 's grandson Michael and his Stanford classmate , Richard Price , both of them dis satisfied and disillusioned with the philosophies they had studied in the classrooms . They founded the Esalen Institute in 1962 to use the property around the hot springs to encourage alternative ways of understanding and experiencing the world . <p> Esalen , too , would enter the national consciousness as a symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forum for transformational practices , " it attracted people interested in radical change in their own lives , in their society , in the traditional thought patterns of the Western world . They came to meditate , to interact , to study the philosophies and practice the rites of Buddhists and shamans and medicine men and Jungian analysts . They came to hear Alan Watts proclaim that Western science was a sham , or to hear Timothy Leary summon them to " Turn On , Tune In and Drop Out . " <p> Life was on the wild side in the early days . There were folk festivals where 3,000 people might show up to hear songs like " Ballad of the South Coast . " There was the time when a zany guy named Zebo , who turned up regularly on such occasions , picked up Lily Tomlin as she was performing and jumped with her into the pool . An alert operative no ticed she was wired to a mike and might be electrocuted . So he slammed all the circuit breakers and saved the day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a polished academy , " as one of the survivors of the Henry Miller days puts it petulantly . Old-timers say that the turning point came in 1980 when , during the first premonitions of the crack-up of the Communist empire , Esalen brokered an exchange between American and Soviet scholars and lecturers . Among those on the Soviet side was a minor apparatchik named Boris Yeltsin . It was felt that some of the unbridled goings-on on the cliffs of Big Sur might give the visitors a wrong idea of America , and severe restrictions were imposed on public taking of controlled substances and on public nudity outside the hot baths . <p> Esalen presents the picture of an Ivy League campus , spread across an exceptionally attractive stretch of woodland overlooking the Pacific . Cheerfully earnest young students , with a smattering of graybeards , gravitate among workshops , study groups , seminars , meditative sessions , in such courses as " Awakening the Buddha Within , " " Gestalt Process , " " Golf ... An Exploration of the Deeper Game , " " Reichian Energetics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applied Shamanism . " Instead of a revolution , they are seeking self-help , expanded horizons , a widened awareness . <p> The hippies are long gone now , to die of overdoses or become associate professors in conventional colleges . The outcast figure who presaged their experimentation can be found in Jack Kerouac 's Big Sur , with its remorselessly detailed account of how the King of the Beats came back to Big Sur to recover from the disillusionments of drunken middle age by reconnecting with the wilderness , and how he tried to resume the cheerful wild life of old , but sweet port wine dragged him down to self-loathing and despair and delirium tremens . <p> The gentrified quiet of Big Sur today no doubt would repel Kerouac . It continues to lure people with itching feet . They come from the ends of the earth , from backwoods or city , from northern Mexico or northern Idaho , and just as on the day when Jeffers took his first ride here in 1914 , they all have their story to tell . <p> Strolling down Highway 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into " Tassi " Bob Robinson , once the youngest officer ever to command a ship in the Royal Australian Navy , who chanced to take a trip down to Big Sur one day when his ship was visiting San Francisco Harbor . He discovered a climate much like that of his native Tasmania but with a somewhat more lively social scene . He now runs a tourist compound that happens to boast the liveliest bar in the village . <p> Or it might be Magnus Toren , a Stockholm boy who , after seven years of fetching and delivering yachts in the South Seas , drifted somehow to Big Sur , married a flower child from Kansas and now directs the Henry Miller Library , where pilgrims come from all the continents . <p> Or it might be Jeff Norman , who lives so far up on a ridge it may take him an hour on foot and an hour by four-wheel drive to get down to the village in good weather .

He is also widely acknowledged as an expert on local history . <p> Or it might be a young woman from Appalachia , who was three times throttled by her father to the point of coma , but went on to be come a junior executive at a major corporation . She has now come to Esalen to learn if there is n't something more important in life than building better computers . <p> It is a quiet , prosperous , laid-back place . But there remains that touch of uncertainty , of distant danger in the air . Any heavy rain , and the rain can be heavy , sets people to asking if it will provoke one of those giant mudslides or rockslides that every ten years or so drag parts of Highway 1 into the ocean , cutting off the whole community from the rest of California for weeks or even months at a time .
