That 's not as dumb as it may sound . The Internet and networked computing-and Lou Gerstner  --  are bringing new life to IBM 's old baby , the mainframe . Photograph // LOUIS V. GERSTNER JR . ' S ongoing makeover of International Business Machines Corp . has altered the $72billion-a-year company-No. 6 on this year 's FORTUNE 500 list-in all sorts of interesting ways . For starters , there 's the corporate uniform : Sweaters , chinos , and loafers have replaced starched white shirts , sensible suits , and wingtips in many IBM offices . The jargon is different too : Only in a descriptive pinch do IBMers utter antiquated terms like " mainframe " or " midsize processors . " Instead , they prefer to apply the voguish and vaguish word " server " to just about every computer Big Blue makes ; that is , except desktop PCs and workstations . Those they call " clients " now . Likewise , the company 's sprawling , rectilinear , 33-year-old headquarters building , which lords over a flattened , treeless hilltop outside Armonk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " obsoleted . " Last September a squadron of earthmovers tore into the rolling woods nearby , breaking ground for a new command center Gerstner can call his own . Viewed from the air , it will look a little like a lightning bolt . But the more things change , the more they stay the same . Despite its well-chronicled struggles , IBM is still by far the world 's largest computer maker ; despite its recent rebound , IBM still faces the problem that has confounded it for years-how to grow . Sales surged a robust 12% in 1995 following four years of stagnation , but analysts are predicting that growth will fall back to half that rate in 1996 , even as competitors like Hewlett-Packard ( No. 20 , $32 billion ) and Compaq ( No. 72 , $15 billion ) are expected to expand by more than 20% . IN RECENT months , Gerstner has been promoting a far-reaching new growth strategy . Called " network-centric computing , " the plan bristles with the industry 's most overworked buzzwords . As part of it , Gerstner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order on IBM 's wide-ranging businesses . The irony is that the foundation of the strategy is n't the Internet , but a breed of product many have long predicted was headed for the glue factory-that old warhorse , the mainframe computer . That is not to say Gerstner 's plan is backward-looking . If anything , it is the most perspicacious and coherent strategy IBM has had in a decade , because it finally gets the company 's 228,000 employees marching in roughly the same direction as the rest of the computer industry : toward a world where , thanks to ubiquitous data networks and the Internet , computers of all stripes can coexist and even work in concert , rather than struggle mainly to displace one another . In such a world , every conceivable kind of information will be digitally stored on mainframes-now known as " large servers " and still the most reliable and cost-effective way to manage vast seas of data . " Look , " says the stern , 54-year-old CEO , who speaks with the deliberate forcefulness of an E Lee Bailey , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got here , having not been part of this industry , I could not believe that the mainframe was dead . I mean , in every business I 'd ever seen , in every business I was on the board of , I could n't imagine running it without large-scale mainframes and huge transaction-processing software and databases and so on . " For emphasis , Gerstner pounds both fists on the helipad-size mahogany table in the conference room outside his office . " The fact of the matter is , we have not yet digitized all of the world 's knowledge . Most of it is still analog . As it becomes more and more digitized , and as the cost of telecommunications bandwidth goes down , you 're going to see very large growth in the large server business ... So in a sense , the industry is moving our way , and customers are beginning to look to a different set of solutions that play to a lot of our strengths . " No question things are looking up for IBM . In 1995 , Gerstner 's second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped back into growth mode but also saw profits double , to $6.3 billion , before $2.1 billion of special charges . Just as important , nearly all of Big Blue 's cylinders were firing : Sales of large and medium-size servers swelled by 6% ; specialized PC and Unix workstation servers by 21% ; desktop PCs , 14% ; Unix workstations , 28% ; software , 12% ; semiconductors , 38% ; and service and " systems integration " consulting , 31% . The only laggards were IBM 's perpetually sputtering telecommunications equipment business , which grew only 2% , and disk drives and other data-storage devices , which actually shrank by 7% . The other big news came last July , when the company shelled out $3.5 billion for Lotus Development , maker of Notes " groupware " for personal computers . The acquisition was uncharacteristic for IBM , and either prescient or foolish , depending on whom you ask . Photograph From the air , Gerstner 's new headquarters will look like a lightning bolt . // The stock market has displayed its approval of IBM 's performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong fourth-quarter earnings . Investors drove up the share price by 66% , to a peak of $129 in March . It 's getting harder to remember that when Gerstner arrived in Armonk on April Fool 's Day 1993 , the company was in the throes of a near-death experience , and its share price was languishing at $52 . Even so , Gerstner 's plan is easy to mock , if only because it comes across like the rediscovery of the obvious . Compaq , Microsoft , Hewlett-Packard , and Digital Equipment have been talking clients and servers for years , and Sun Microsystems has used the slogan " The network is the computer " since the late Eighties . The Internet was all the rage even before the Lotus acquisition . Moreover , when you really think about it , networks are anything but centric . SOME ARMCHAIR quarterbacks have more serious criticisms . A rival CEO calls Big Blue a " cash cow with no real future " because it is much less dominant and profitable in fast-growing businesses than in slow-growing ones . More than one ex-IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to pull an AT &T; and break up into nimbler , more focused entities , or at least to shed its weaker units . Says one : " More than anything , IBM needs to simplify itself . " Gerstner is intent on keeping IBM whole , however , and his network-centric strategy , with its renewed emphasis on big iron , looks like the best way to grow . After all , System 390 mainframe hardware and software account for some 15% of IBM 's sales and an even bigger share of profits . If you add the take from the 390 's little brothers , the " midrange " AS/400 servers , from a new line of POWERparallel processors , and from mainframe disk drives , big iron accounts for about one third of IBM 's business . What 's more , large-systems sales drive much of IBM 's systems-integration and consulting business  --  one of its fastest-growing segments . Gerstner is betting that even a modest gain in big iron will trigger greater growth elsewhere in the company . HIS STRATEGY marks a turning point for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business brings in nearly twice as much revenue as mainframes , Gerstner believes desktop machines are no longer the industry 's driving force : " The predominant focus of applications for the last 20 years has been the individual desktop computer . That age is over . Corporate customers have discovered that PCs have produced very little productivity from the point of view of the enterprise . Now , I would suspect that all of us who use these devices feel like we 've benefited a lot from them . But the data is overwhelming that the stand-alone PC is an enormously expensive proposition for an enterprise . " Meanwhile , the Internet has given PC users a tantalizing taste of what big iron can do for them . Hook up your PC to the Internet , and it 's as if you 've connected to an infinitely roomy disk drive filled with everything you could ever want to know-corporate archives , multimedia libraries , reference material-and more . You ask for it , and the server finds it and delivers it to your desk , and , if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn , IBM 's senior vice president for research : " The applications that make a difference in the way we work are going to be on the server . After all , that 's what a World Wide Web site really is-a server that does something for you . " The real action is n't on your desktop anymore . To put it in blunter , more colloquial terms , it 's the server , stupid . So Gerstner is busy rejiggering priorities at IBM , putting more emphasis on big servers and the software to make them engaging and useful . To succeed , he has to tweak the knobs on virtually all of IBM 's businesses . Nobody expects the strategy to pay off immediately , but most Wall Street analysts are much more sanguine about Big Blue 's prospects than they 've been in years . " What 's different now is that the winds of the computer business are n't blowing against IBM anymore , " says Dan Mandresh of Merrill Lynch . " Finally , IBM has some room to maneuver . " As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at IBM than many expected , given that his resume describes someone other than your typical computer executive . After getting his MBA at Harvard in 1962 , he joined McKinsey &; Co. as a consultant . In 1970 , McKinsey assigned him to advise the new CEO of American Express , James Robinson III ; Gerstner helped plot the company 's diversification into Wall Street . Ultimately he joined Amex full-time , and by 1985 was president . Four years later he became CEO of RJR Nabisco Holdings , where he stayed until a desperate IBM lured him away in 1993 . " Lou Gerstner 's coming was a real test for us , " recalls research chief Horn . " There was some fear that a guy from a cookie company would n't care much about technology , much less understand it . But I 'm happy to say his first site visit was to the research labs . " Working in Gerstner 's favor was his college degree in engineering-it gave him something in common with literally tens of thousands of IBM employees . Moreover , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build competitive advantage . At American Express , he helped mastermind a $250 million computer-systems overhaul that gave the company a leg up in providing billing information to merchants and cardholders . In short , Gerstner had been one of IBM 's smarter customers . He 's quite comfortable talking and thinking about computers . Yet he approaches the business from a very different angle than most computer company CEOs : " I start every day with customers , but this is an industry that starts every day with technology . It is driven by its technological accomplishments , which are enormous . But what 's happening in the marketplace is being driven by customers . The Internet 's been around for 25 years . What made it suddenly emerge ? Well , the real issue is that customers are changing the way they 're thinking about information technology . " Time now for a quick review of the industry 's recent history , with a little help from the CEO . The idea of linking PCs and workstations into networks began to take hold about ten years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a network boosted productivity . To describe this new form of computation , the industry settled on a name that was predictably nerdy and sterile : client/server computing . Soon every company that mattered jumped on the client/server bandwagon . Pundits explained how diverse computers and networks from different manufacturers could be linked , and predicted that the corporate data stored in big iron would soon be parceled out among servers that were smaller , cheaper , and closer to the folks who actually use the information . Thus was born another opaque term : distributed computing . FOR MANY businesses that spent millions assembling client/server networks , the scheme backfired . Says Gerstner , sounding appropriately geeky : " The promise of client/server was that an enterprise would be able to connect all of its distributed systems into a seamless network , and that you would n't have to rely on a single supplier to provide integration . Well , it failed . So now we have the client/server model being too expensive and too complex and not delivering on its promises . " This does n't mean corporations do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues , is to address computing chores on three levels instead of two : " You will have ubiquitous desktop and portable client computers that will become increasingly simple , with less and less of the applications and data residing solely on them . You will have special-purpose servers that will do things for you , like the FedEx World Wide Web server that lets you get information about your overnight parcels . You will have big central servers to which those special-purpose servers will connect in sophisticated ways , where all the data is stored . " IBM is already churning out mainframes and midsize computers by the tens of thousands to supply the Internet and the networked corporate world . These machines are utterly unlike the big iron of decades past . As part of its multibillion-dollar restructuring in 1993 , IBM completely revamped the way its big computers are built and priced . In System/390 machines , exotic water-cooled circuit modules have given way to economic air-cooled boards stuffed with industry-standard chips . Its AS/400 and POWERparallel lines are built around souped-up versions of the PowerPC , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new computers generate solid profits-gross margins are around 50% . Yet compared with the traditional IBM mainframes and minicomputers that they supersede , they are a steal . So deeply did IBM cut prices with the new designs that while the total computing power it shipped last year surged by 59% , its revenues from large servers rose just 6% . All three new lines are priced to sell against computers from Hewlett-Packard , Compaq , and other players in the client/server arena . Part of IBM 's surge in 1995 can be attributed to pent-up demand : customers dumping costly old mainframes for cheaper new ones . Indeed , some analysts predict System 390 sales will actually decline in 1996 , and that AS/400 sales will rise only slightly . But there is evidence that demand growth for large computers is accelerating . Contends Nicholas Donofrio , senior vice president of IBM 's server group : " People say that the growth we had last year is a bubble . I say the previous few years were a trough that we are now pulling out of . When you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new customers , and it 's a similar story with the System 390 . " Donofrio and his lieutenants are working overtime on ways to make big iron more indispensable than ever . In one major initiative , known as the Information Utility program , IBM has set out to create vast mainframe installations in which customers can save money by letting IBM handle their data processing and storage chores . IBM has already designed such sites for banks and health care providers . IBM IS ALSO WORKING on Internet applications : jumbo Web servers to meet the needs of millions of consumers surfing the Internet simultaneously ; mainframes tuned so that corporate data , such as customer and product information , financial records and archives , are readily accessible to authorized users on the Net . There are even mildly Orwellian applications in the works : a tracking program that lets a mainframe learn the habits of consumers or employees who use it , the better to anticipate their information needs . Five years from now , if you log on to the Internet and order your fall wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to suggest a spring wardrobe that is exactly to your taste . Photograph Internet czar Wladawsky-Berger foresees an era of computing not dominated by Intel or Microsoft : " Is n't the free market wonderful ? " // Listen to Gerstner &; Co. , and you begin to think IBM might have a bright future after all . One big reason is that , for the first time in years , Intel and Microsoft are n't calling most of the plays for the industry . No company controls the technology standards that unlock the power of the Internet , says IBM 's Internet czar , a voluble Cuban emigre named Irving Wladawsky-Berger . He finds the opportunity thrilling : " Is n't the free market wonderful ? For the first time in the history of our industry we 're starting a new wave , and there are no chokepoints : no IBMs , no Intels , no Microsofts . We all will compete simply on the basis of the quality of what we can deliver . " The big question for IBM : Can it deliver not only the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? Because of the shift in the market , IBM sees its businesses in a wholly different light . Some , like big iron , have reemerged as pivotal to growth , while others have been marginalized . One of Gerstner 's toughest tasks is to find the right balance among IBM 's business lines . Among those that seem to matter less and less to IBM are PC hardware and software , and not merely because IBM 's PC hardware business was eclipsed last year by Compaq . A bigger reason is that the entire PC business has turned into a nearly profitless commodity game that 's beginning to resemble the consumer electronics market . Indeed , the PC hardware sector is consistently one of the company 's least profitable . Also , PCs are no longer driving change in the industry now that the network 's the thing . Beyond that , IBM seems to have accepted , finally , that it lost the battle with Microsoft and Intel to control the PC . Over the years Big Blue spent billions trying to turn its powerful OS/2 operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no avail . While IBM will never kill off OS/2 , in recent months it has acknowledged that it will also vigorously support its nemesis , Windows NT , on all its microcomputer products . Also , IBM has all but burned its bridges with Apple Computer , a company with which it had grand designs to challenge the Pentium/Windows stranglehold . Finally , Gerstner is flat-out not interested in the consumer PC business : " Enterprises purchase 90% of the information technology sold in the world . Consumers purchase 10% . True , the consumer segment 's growing faster , but from a very much smaller base . When I talk customers , I talk enterprises . " Two other lines of business that are fading in importance are the company 's underachievers : data-storage devices , like disk and tape drives , and networking equipment , like switches and routers-a sector in which IBM is being outflanked by Cisco Systems , Bay Networks , and other competitors . That leaves four sectors that really matter in network-centric computing : servers , software , semiconductors , and service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electronics industry . Big iron faces a pair of sumo wrestlers in Hitachi and Amdahl ( 44% owned by Fujitsu ) ; special-purpose servers have to wrangle with the teeming hordes of the PC and workstation industries , including Compaq , Sun , Hewlett-Packard , and Digital ; semiconductors have to bang the boards with Intel , NEC , and others ; software has to mudwrestle with Microsoft and Oracle ; and service tangles with EDS and Andersen Consulting . Those are just the big names . Moreover , these four lines of business are interdependent . The server businesses rely on semiconductors for key components , on the software folks for the code that teaches their computers new tricks , and on the service group to customize and install the systems and to make sure they grow ever more useful and indispensable to customers . // GERSTNER 'S CONTROL PANEL // Some of those business lines face greater challenges than others . Semiconductors , for example , works for two masters-its sister divisions at IBM and customers on the outside . It 's a tough , tough business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM has had a hard time meeting development schedules for more powerful versions of the PowerPC . As a result , the product has lost the performance advantage it once held over Intel 's Pentium . Meanwhile , some of Apple 's inventory woes stem from IBM 's delays . Says a recently departed senior IBM official darkly : " The PowerPC is a sordid tale . " Despite OS/2 's troubles , the software tale is anything but sordid . Few people know it , but IBM is the world 's largest purveyor of software , generating sales of $12.7 billion last year , vs. $5.9 billion for Microsoft . Most of that revenue comes from leasing software for big systems-a market in which IBM has little competition . No wonder software is by far Big Blue 's most profitable businessgross margins run around 65% . Network-centric computing will change many of the rules of the PC software game , giving IBM yet another chance . That 's why it bought Lotus last summer ; managed successfully , Notes groupware could give IBM yet another way to appeal to corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service business that Gerstner believes could really boom , especially if IBM can keep sales of big iron growing . Corporate and institutional systems that use large servers are n't easy for customers to design , install , or maintain . Lots more skill is needed if the servers are to be hooked up effectively to the Internet and internal networks . Last year service leaped 31% in sales , edging software to become IBM 's biggest business sector . IBM is better positioned than anyone in this fast-growing $140-billion-ayear subindustry . In 1995 Big Blue carved out a 9% market share , nosing out EDS , the soon-to-be-independent subsidiary of General Motors , for the No. 1 spot . In such a fragmented marketplace , there 's lots of room to grab more business . The downside is that gross margins from services are only a third of those in the software business and less than half of those for servers . Perhaps the most promising area within the service business is outsourcing-taking over the management of data processing for entire enterprises or even groups of companies . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in others , it means building the equivalent of " data warehouses " in which customers can lease storage space . It 's a business in which IBM itself can create demand for big iron . CLEARLY there is more of a cando attitude around Armonk . Gerstner 's network-centric strategy , for all its reliance on recycled ideas and re-purposed products , has struck a chord throughout IBM . Perhaps that should be no surprise . Gerstner has proven throughout his career to be a consummate strategist . Now it 's a matter of execution . How does Gerstner himself think it will all play out ? Springing up from the circular table after precisely 60 minutes of answering questions , he replies : " I 'm not in the business of predicting . I just sort of try to keep this company moving forward every day . Okay ? I mean , there are a lot of other people in this industry who like to predict ... " He shoves his chair under the table . " I 've got to go . " <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
