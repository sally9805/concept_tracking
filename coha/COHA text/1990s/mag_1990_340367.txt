The ancient Greeks promoted the ideal of the well-rounded person , a soundly trained mind in a soundly trained body , tempering ambition with recreation , mingling contemplation and combat . But then the Greeks did n't have endorsement contracts . It is all well and good to talk about waiting until one 's eligibility  --  uh , education  --  is completed , but when an eighth-grader can sign sponsorship deals worth potentially $1 million a year , what 's the real point of further schooling ? It might provide some cultural grounding and social polish , but the purpose is plainly not to qualify for a well-paying job . <P> One wonders , for example , if the teachers at Palmer Academy in Wesley Chapel , Fla. , felt just a little silly having homework assignments faxed to straight-A student Jennifer Capriati during a week when she earned $28,000 on the tennis court alone , probably more than some of those teachers make in a year . They will face that question again and again in months to come . Capriati , for anyone who missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sturdily built 5-ft. 6 1/2-in. 13-year-old with nerve , force and a powerful backhand  --  plus a business manager , a press agent and a sometime coach named Billie Jean King . She is also , in the far-from- isolated judgment of veteran NBC tennis commentator Bud Collins , " the best American player since Billie Jean . " That accolade puts her above the likes of Pam Shriver , Tracy Austin and Capriati 's friend and role model , Chris Evert , the sport 's winningest player of all time . <P> The invariable caution raised about allowing young players onto the professional tour is that they may be subject to premature burnout , either physical or mental . The prime examples cited are Austin , who twice won the U.S. Open before departing at 21 , and Andrea Jaeger , who made the finals of the French Open and Wimbledon before packing it in at 19 . Yet the counterexamples of enduring grit can be equally persuasive : Evert , who began playing at the top level at 16 , kept going until her September retirement at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martina Navratilova , 33 , is still playing about as well as ever . <P> When Capriati was three , her father Stefano , a self-taught tennis pro who emigrated from Milan , put a racquet into her hands ; by the time she was four , she was fending off barrages from a ball machine and was delivered into the tutelage of Jimmy Evert , whose most famous coaching product was his daughter Christine Marie . Last year Capriati won the 18-and-under titles at the French and U.S. Opens and made the junior quarterfinals at Wimbledon .
