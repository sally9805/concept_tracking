Environmentalists are sounding an 11th-hour warning about the explosives that Iraqi soldiers have planted around most of Kuwait 's 700 oil wells and 21 processing plants . If those devices are set off , the subsequent conflagration could create " a nuclear-winter-like situation , " asserts Paul Crutzen , director of Germany 's Max Planck Institute for Chemistry . Jordanian experts say the wells could burn 10 million bbl. of oil a day , releasing a vast cloud of black smoke into the stratosphere . Such a cloud has the potential to screen sunlight , reduce temperatures and damage crops throughout the northern hemisphere . Not all experts agree with the grim forecasts , contending that Kuwaiti oil fields are too far apart to combine into one conflagration . If only some wells blow , the multibillion-dollar task of extinguishing the fires would be unlike any previous disaster . Much of Kuwait 's crude lies close to the surface and could continuously feed the flames . Ensuing fire storms , producing temperatures exceeding 160 degreesF , could keep fire fighters at bay for a year . " Leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Crutzen , " so that such an act of madness will not take place . "
