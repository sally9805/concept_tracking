<p> Educate Texas inmates As the Jan. 25 editorial , " " Texas justice , " makes clear , reducing recidivism in Texas prisons should be a top priority - especially when " " almost half of released inmates are returned to prison . " <p> There is solid evidence that investing in inmates ' education pays huge dividends to taxpayers and lawmakers alike . <p> Texas currently houses 127,000 inmates at a cost of $ 17,000 per inmate per year - so each inmate who is released and who does not return saves taxpayers $ 17,000 a year . <p> The University of Houston-Clear Lake offers college degrees to inmates , and the facts from the UHCL program speak for themselves . For UHCL graduates ( BS or BA ) who left Texas prisons between 1986-1992 , the recidivism rate has been 5.3 percent , considerably less than the 48 percent for the general prison population . <p> It costs about $ 1,000 per year to keep an inmate in higher education , and much of this is paid by the prisoner as a condition of parole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain that Texas can not afford to pass up . The people of Texas should insist that their legislators fund such a clearly cost-effective program . <p> Tom McCall is the program coordinator in literature for the University of Houston in Clear Lake <p> Wrong to blame the teachers <p> Regarding the Feb. 2 story , " " Growing up in prison - Courts attempt to balance punishment , psychiatric counseling for child criminal " : <p> The story stated that pre-teen murderers were : " " ignored , neglected and failed by parents , teachers and social workers . " <p> Once again , teachers are casually handed part of the blame for the sociopathic behavior of children who admittedly need intensive psychiatric care . This is horribly unfair . <p> Teachers are paid a tiny fraction of their societal worth and work under constraints that most of us would find maddening . <p> They are supposed to nurture ; but to hug a child is to open themselves to allegations of sexual abuse . <p> They are supposed to grade students on their achievements ; but are made to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . <p> They are supposed to counteract a lifetime of abuse and neglect by parents in the few minutes a day that they can carve out for each individual child . <p> Most teachers care deeply for their students ; and so when tragically faced with " " deeply troubled and violent children , " their first duty is to protect the other students ( and themselves ) from the dangerous ones . It is shameful that they do n't get support , but instead are labeled as part of the problem . <p> Lauren Slaten , Houston <p> The truth about tax cuts <p> I find it amazing , but mostly frustrating , to listen to people day after day talk about how tax cuts will decrease revenue and cause deficits . <p> Herbert Stein 's Feb. 8 Outlook article about taxation is a classic example of how people disregard the facts about tax cuts . <p> Ronald Reagan cut taxes in the 1980s and revenues skyrocketed along with an economic boom . Even John F. Kennedy said , " " It is a paradoxical " truth that cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . By cutting taxes and cutting the handouts and pork , you will balance the budget . Why does everyone ignore this fact ? <p> Brian Rich , Spring <p> A steeply graduated tax <p> Stanley Bass says a national sales tax on nonessential items would be unfair to people whose only income is Social Security . He wrote : " " Can anything be less fair to nonwage earners ? " <p> In fact , it would be a steeply graduated tax ; as the more money we make , the higher the percentage spent on nonessential items . A person whose total income is Social Security spends little on nonessential items . It would also tax illegal income . <p> There are many people living extravagant lifestyles and paying no taxes under our present system . Bass thinks " " fair " means beneficial to him . <p> Glenn Spraker , Sugar Land <p> Executions not cheaper <p> The Feb. 4 story , " " Executions do n't end all the nightmares , " unfortunately perpetuates two misunderstandings . <p> The first is that society can only protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The simple truth is that society can protect itself by keeping these people in prison for life . <p> The second misunderstanding is that it is cheaper to execute prisoners than to keep them in prison for life . Studies have shown that it is at least two to three times more expensive to sentence someone to death than to life in prison . This figure will not change significantly even if the appeals process is speeded up . <p> Dave Atwood , Housto <p> What is in a label ? <p> Jane Ely 's Jan. 31 column illustrates how even a normally astute observer can be confused by current political labels . <p> The column commiserates with the plight of " " moderates , " especially those in the Republican Party , because of the take-over by " " extremists . " <p> In fact , much of the apparent surge of extremism involves not a change of opinion but a change in labels . <p> Millions of pro-life voters - many of them " " moderate " in their political views , many of whom used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - have been reclassified as extreme rightists ( and even more sinister , religious rightists ) . <p> Although Ely sees the presence of all these extremists as an embarrassment to the Republican Party , I suspect that the labels actually hurt the Democrats . In labeling them as extremely right wing , Democrats motivate pro-life people to vote Republican no matter how uncomfortable they may be with other policies of that party . <p> To offset this , I suggest that some clever Democrats might join the Republican Party , fervently advocate the flat tax , label all advocates of the graduated income tax as mad leftists and begin to wring their hands at the resulting rise of extremism . With the flat-tax albatross around their necks , Republican presidential candidates could be expected to do about as well as their Democrat counterparts have done since 1972 , when they were first saddled with the pro-choice albatross . <p> John C. Gallagher , Houston <p> Both parties are lying <p> I wonder which political party is responsible for my Medicare supplement premium going up $ 278 a year in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical limited income , I will be forced to switch to a less costly plan , which will include fewer choices as to doctors and hospitals . <p> Both parties claim they are not targeting the poor and elderly to balance the budget . <p> Both parties say they will not force seniors into managed health care plans . <p> Both parties are lying to us . A pox on both their houses . <p> Connie Walker , Houston <p> It 's greed , greed , greed <p> Regarding D.D.Ireland 's Feb. 5 letter about the Oilers : Bravo ! In light of the dire need for new schools in this city , it sickens me to witness the time , money and press already afforded the squabble concerning the Oilers . <p> I do n't intend to turn my back and allow them to " " pick my pocket " for a cause in which I have not an iota of interest . <p> While we 're at it , let us not leave the Astros out of that elite group of " " dope-using , fist-fighting , wife-beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greed , greed , greed . It 's going to be the death of us all . <p> K. Hill , Houston
