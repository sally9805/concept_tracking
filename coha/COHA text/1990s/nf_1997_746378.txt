Sport skill execution is of social importance to the American culture because " sports are a part of the American scene " ( Pangrazi &; Dauer , 1995 , p. 603 ) . Graham , Holt/Hale , and Parker ( 1987 ) contend that youth sports are one the strongest influences on children today . Gallahue ( 1995 ) proports an estimated 20 to 35 million children in the United States participate in youth sports , with an estimated 16 million between the ages of 6-16 participating in non-school sponsored sports programs . Play and sports activities are key elements in the cultural socialization process , and it may even be that " cultural attitudes and values can be transmitted ( in some undefined and almost mystical way ) through physical activity " ( p. 434 ) . Such experiences can influence a child 's self image either for good or bad . Children who can not run fast enough or throw a ball far enough may experience social ostracism ( Humphrey , 1974 ) . It is important that young children acquire the fundamental skills necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical ( Thomas , Thomas , &; Gallagher , 1993 ; Weiss , Ebbeck , &; Rose , 1992 ; Wiese-Bjornstal &; Weiss , 1992 ) . Children should encounter skills under optimum conditions for successful mastery . <p> Effective teaching of fundamental motor skills is a vital part of the learning process . The organized school physical education program is the most reasonable place for such teaching to take place , and if programs are effective , improved motor skills should result . The National Association for Sport and Physical Education ( 1992 ) state the physically educated person " demonstrates competence in a variety of manipulative , locomotor , and nonlocomotor skills . " Effective teaching in the school physical education setting involves the proper process . Several researchers recommend using refinement tasks , or teaching cues , to achieve successful skill performance ( Masser , 1993 , 1987 ; Pellet &; Harrison , in press ; Smith &; Eson , 1990 ; Rikard , 1992 ; Rink , 1993 ) . Rink ( 1993 ) includes refinement as one of the three types of tasks an effective teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concern for quality of performance by explaining how the performance should be done . When implementing refinement tasks the teacher should ask , " what does it mean to perform the experience well ? " ( p. 109 ) . The instructor formulates " cues " to answer this question . Masser ( 1993 ) believes " refining tasks should contain one critical cue that will give children a pertinent cue to concentrate on while performing the movement that will help improve their performance " ( p. 302 ) . <p> Research documenting the effectiveness of verbal cues in teaching and refining psychomotor skills is plentiful ( Masser , 1987 ; Pellett &; Harrison , in press ; Rink , French , Werner , Lynn , &; Mays , 1991 ; Smith &; Eason , 1990 ; Werner &; Rink , 1989 ) . For example , Masser ( 1987 ) found both immediate and long-term positive effects for kindergarten through second grade children using refinement tasks to learn the standing broad jump . Rikard ( 1992 ) reported high-skilled fourth graders greatly improved striking skills when taught using refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement tasks were used . Smith and Eason ( 1990 ) examined dart throwing performance of college female athletes and nonathletes using appropriate cues . Results substantiated increased performance in both groups . <p> Masser ( 1993 ) provided other insights into the use of cues to teach motor skill . She investigated the effectiveness of using one appropriate cue when teaching the handstand and forward roll to first graders . Results demonstrated teachers helped students improve physical performance with the use of the cue . In addition , Masser illustrated the importance of the wording of cues for effectiveness . She noted a significantly better performance by children taught the cue " shoulders over your knuckles " as opposed to " shoulders over your hands . " <p> Cue formulation seems to be an ongoing process with continual revision of cue phraseology according to various conditions . However , the selection of correct cues , that accurately convey effective information , is not well documented . Teachers must determine which cues should be developed for individual skills , students , and settings . Each should be analyzed and developmentally sequenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cues for the overhand throw , many sources exist ( Graham et al . 1993 ; Masser , 1990 ; Masser , 1993 , Roberton , 1984 ) . Roberton 's ( 1984 ) developmental sequence for the overhand throw is one such example ( Figure 1 ) . As one studies this sequence , it becomes apparent that many learners could not remember all these details . However , from this source components can be prioritized and cues designed . <p> Graham et al . ( 1993 , p. 371 ) suggested the following cues for throwing for distance : ( a ) side to target , ( b ) arm way back , ( c ) step with opposite foot , and ( d ) follow through . In addition , when the throw is at short distances , opposition and pulling the arm way back were not always needed for accuracy . However , at longer distances , these cues are crucial for good throws . They also suggested three key instructor observation points for throwing : ( a ) Does the child take a forward step on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Do the child 's hips and spine rotate so that they can uncoil in forceful derotation ? , and ( c ) Is the child 's elbow flexed and held away from the body and extended on the back swing ? <p> Masser ( 1990,1991 ) provided extensive research on overhead throwing cues summarized in three studies including 1100 elementary school participants . Her research included a pretest , posttest , and 3-month retention test . Each study was an evaluation of progression and produced a revision of cues . The purpose of Masser 's research was fourfold . She hoped to determine ( a ) how to teach children to throw effectively , ( b ) if cues were an effective teaching tool , ( c ) what errors were made by children , and ( d ) what changes in cues were needed to help children throw correctly . Masser 's research produced three cues for overhand throwing by children : " stand sideways with eyes on target , " " take a big step toward target , " and " take the arm way back and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce correct throwing patterns in children and that teaching grip and using the cue " keep your eye on the target " were not valuable cues for the whole class . However , individual students may benefit from these cues . <p> Therefore , the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of multiple action cues and which specific cues are pertinent in helping third , fourth , and fifth grade students improve performance of the overhand throw for distance . Graham et al . ( 1993 ) observed that children have limited success in combining throwing and catching in game situations . Since basic skills such as throwing and catching are prerequisites for advanced sports and dance movement patterns , children should develop mature catching and throwing skills in appropriate practice situations . METHODS Participants <p> With the work of Masser ( 1987 ) and Graham et al . ( 1993 ) as a foundation , 180 third , fourth , and fifth grade children , from a university laboratory school , were preassessed by the same observer . As each threw 10 balls overhand for distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big step with the opposite foot of the throwing hand , " and " take your arm straight down and stretch it way back " were evaluated ( Figure 2 ) . <p> The subjects who performed at Level One or Two in the preassessment were divided in two treatment groups ( N=44 children : 32 girls , 12 boys ) . Both genders and each grade were randomly assigned to two treatment groups : the Cue and Non Cue ( NC ) group . Each group consisted of 22 participants ( 16 girls and 6 boys ) . The makeup of each group was 6 fifth graders ( 4 girls and 2 boys ) , and 8 fourth graders ( 7 girls , and 1 boy ) . Forty-two participants finished the research , 21 in each group . Two subjects did not finish the study , one fourth grade boy in the Cue group , and one fifth grade boy in the NC group . Instruction <p> Administration approval and parent notification took place prior to the study . The experimental teaching unit ( ETU ) was 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pretesting took place during gessions one and two . Sessions three through seven ( 5 days ) were instruction days . Post-testing was conducted on days eight and nine in exactly the same manner as the pretest . Classes began at 2:30 p.m. and lasted 30 minutes . Each class consisted of a 5-minute warm-up which included a jogging circuit around cones , sit-ups , and arm and leg stretches . <p> An experienced teacher of 10 years taught all subjects to be sure both groups were taught exactly the same way . The only instructional difference was the inclusion of cues for the Cue group . However , all subjects were given the stationary cue , " stand sideways . " The same specific detailed lesson plan , with extension and refinement activities , was followed for group instruction . ( See Figure 3 for lesson plan example ) . Both groups received identical instructional demonstration and practice trials as prescribed by the lesson plan . The instructor performed demonstrations so subjects could see the demonstrator from the saggital , frontal , and posterior views . Those subjects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following the demonstration , students in both groups practiced throwing at identical targets and distance markers . Both groups received the same specific number of practice trials . Both groups threw 318 balls in 5 days at creative targets and distance markers . <p> The preassessment revealed the following errors were commonly made by Level One and Two participants : ( a ) improper foot position , ( b ) lack of windup or proper back swing , and ( c ) poor release position . These findings substantiated Masser 's cues , and revealed a need for a cue highlighting ball release position . Thus , the cues selected for use in the current study included : Take a big step toward the target , with opposite foot of throwing arm . Take arm straight down , then stretch it way back . Release the ball when you see fingers . <p> The Cue group practiced the overhand throw with particular emphasis on the three action cues . They also received feedback on execution of cues , whether it was corrective or simply to verify correctness ( e.g. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . job " . ) . Care was taken to give one cue at a time , so students were able to selectively attend to a specific cue . To assist in this process , drills focused on one cue . However , culminating activities incorporated all three cues . The NC group received management directions such as how and where to stand . They received no feedback on execution or performance . They were told to watch the demonstration and then throw the same way . Data Collection <p> All subjects were pre- and posttested throwing tennis balls , as recommended by Pangrazi &; Dauer ( 1995 ) when teaching young children to throw for distance . Three balls were thrown for distance . The longest throw , recorded in inches , was used as the score . Each subject also threw five balls , while being videotaped , for later performance analysis . The thrower was instructed to throw the best way he/she could and not worry about distance . The videocamera was situated 10 feet saggitally to the performer and 5 feet forward , so the arm motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 frame/s with a high speed shutter ( 1/1000 ) set . <p> Engaged learning time for both groups was regulated by counting the number of throws practiced by each subject . Ten balls were thrown at a time . All retrieved 10 ten-his balls when the last subject had thrown . Everyone threw a set number of balls for each drill each day . Balls thrown consisted of 55 throws the first day , 60 throws the second day , 73 throws the third day , 60 throws the fourth day , and 70 throws the fifth day , for a total of 318 balls over 5 days . This total included 278 tennis balls and 40 soft softballs . These softballs were used in warm-up drills , and all students threw the same number . <p> Safety of the students was a concern because they had not been throwing regularly . Children in both groups did not throw more than 73 balls in any 30-minute session , with the maximum number at one time being 10 . The number of drills increased from five to eight with a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5 days of instruction were designed with the intent of student success without fatigue or injury . No injuries or complaints emerged during the testing . Absent students participated in makeup sessions the following morning , taught using the same lesson plans . Subjects joined the regular class in the afternoon with a rested arm . Students absent for 2 days were dropped from the study . Data Analysis <p> The pre- and posttest videotape analysis was obtained for each subject . Roberton ( 1984 ) ( Figure 2 ) furnished the criteria . One point was scored for each level the subject mastered . For example , the foot action re-suited in a total of four points , and the arm action , five points . Two researchers , one involved in the study , and the other a trained curriculum and instructional professional ? examined the videos independent of each other . Results were correlated for agreement to validate inter-rarer reliability ( r=.864 ) . In addition , each reviewer examined the same subject three times on different days , to verify intra-rater reliability ( r ' =.954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cue " release the ball when you see your fingers " . This will be competed at a later date , using a quantitative technique to examine the angle of release of the throw . Currently , it was assumed that the further a participant could throw the ball would reflect a more correct angle of release ( being that a correct angle of release allows for greater distance ) , which in turn is related to releasing the ball when one could see their fingers . <p> The research design used by Masser ( 1991 ) , without a control group and leaving the statistical analysis with only one degree of freedom , was also the model for this study . Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) was conducted on the resulting data , with pretest scores serving as covariates . The cue vs. noncue group served as the independent variable , while the dependent variables were the arm and foot action ( process data ) , and the distance thrown ( product data ) . RESULTS <p> The average performance of the two groups ( Cue and Non-Cue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown in an isolated situation , are shown in Table 1 . No significant differences were noted between the groups for the pretest ( arm action : F = .526 , p&lt;.472 ; foot action : F = 1.6 , p&lt;.213 ; distance thrown : F =.112 , p&lt;.739 ) . The Cue group showed significant improvement in throwing ability based on the variables examined : arm action Cue ( F = 30.39 , p&lt;.001 ) , foot action Cue ( F = 38.76 , p&lt;.001 ) , and distance thrown ( F = 5.80 , p&lt;.021 ) . <p> The greatest improvement by the Cue group was evidenced in the foot action . During pretest the Cue group mean was below the NC group , though not significantly different . During posttest the Cue group scores had improved an average 2.05 points based on a 5-point scale . The NC group improved an average 0.57 points . The point improvement of the arm action was not as great , but also significant . The Cue subjects improved arm action by an average 1.75 points while the NC groups improved an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern to a fairly high level throwing pattern is of practical significance as well . The product of improving a throwing pattern can be noted in the results of the distance the balls were thrown . The distance thrown resulted in an improvement of 78 inches ( 6.5 feet ) for the cue group and only 4.35 inches for the NC Group . DISCUSSION <p> The overhand throw is a fundamental sport skill which all children should acquire . Learning to throw correctly will aid performance in a variety of sports . The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of multiple action cues and which specific cues are pertinent in helping third , fourth , and fifth grade students improve performance of the overhand throw for distance . <p> Performance on both the process variables of arm and foot action , as well as the product of throwing for distance , improved significantly in the cued group . The combination of cues and feedback about those cues appear to be an effective methodology when teaching the overhand throw , in agreement in previous studies ( Masser , 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been documented to be effective , it would be interesting to see what the use of Cues , with and without feedback , would contribute to the learning process . Non the less , due the indications of the current study and previous corroborative research , teaching skill techniques using proper cues should be impressed upon preservice teachers as well as experienced practitioners . Teachers need to gain skill in creating and incorporating the best cues for their own students . Developing this skill aids the teacher in giving meaningful demonstrations so students look for specific actions from the demonstrator . Cues offer a method of analyzing and evaluating motor skill so that specific , corrective feedback can be given . Cues need to be adapted to the age and skill level of the performer . The instructor should be constantly alert to incorporating cues that produce improved skill execution . This can only be accomplished as new cues are developed and existing cues are modified . Recommendations for Cue Modification <p> This study produced information for both cue and instruction recommendations . The video analysis indicated revision for all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ) , often a high big step was taken in the posttest . For Cue 2 ( take arm straight down ) , it was noted that while bringing the arm straight down , the elbow was flexed and the ball brought directly behind the head , rather than stretching the arm out behind the head . <p> Lastly , Cue 3 ( release when you see fingers ) , participants appeared to fail to focus on the target when watching to see fingers . Therefore , the following cue modifications were recommended . First , " Take a long step toward the target with the opposite foot of the throwing arm " . ( Still emphasize standing sideways to begin throw ) . Second , " Take the arm straight down and stretch it way back to make an L with the arm ( keep ball away from head ) " . Third , " Watch the target and release ball when fingers are seen " . <p> The following recommendations emerged after the 5th day ETU experience , in terms of instructional techniques . Confine formal cue instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Provide lead-up games incorporating the cues and use care so three cues are not overwhelming . For example , instruct the students to throw instead of bat . The instructor can then provide feedback on the cues learned , to the thrower ( batter ) as well as fielders . This provides a more game-like situation to practice throwing skills learned . Lastly , include additional cues for advanced students such as ( a ) twist or rotate hips , ( b ) make a whipping action with the wrist at release , and ( c ) transfer weight from back to front like a seesaw ( Graham , et al . 1993 , Masser 1990 ) .
