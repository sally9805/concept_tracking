Right ? Josh : OK , listen to me . You 'd better get some help . You 're headed for trouble . Derek : Whatever . Thanks for the tip . But let me tell you something .

I do n't know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotty a ton of money . Forty large . I do n't know how it happened . I was doing so great , remember ? I won on that Cubs game . Then I just went crazy , betting on everything Narrator : He flopped into a chair . Derek : It was so cool . Winning the bets was even better than winning actual baseball games . It 's crazy . Josh : So what went wrong ? Derek : I started losing a few bets . I just figured I 'd make a big score again and things would be cool . I even stole my dad 's watch to pay Scotty once . But now I 'm too deep . I ca n't steal $40,000 . Josh : OK , we have to talk to Scotty . Maybe we can work something out . Then yo*i.i have to call this guy I know . He can help you . Scene 6 Narrator : We beeped Scotty and told him to meet us at the park . When we found Scotty , Derek just blurted it out . Derek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . But I do n't have it . I can give you a couple hundred , but that 's it . Scotty : Unfortunately , Derek , it 's not that simple . See , you do n't really owe me the money . Derek : What do you mean ? Scotty : You think I 've got this kind of money to throw around ? I work for someone . And it 's not a classmate , understand ? Narrator : To tell the truth , we were both kind of confused . Scotty : They 're wiseguys . With names like " Jimmy the Face . " Gangsters . Like in The Godfather . Josh : Are you kidding me ? Scotty : Not even a little . It 's big business . They came to school and recruited me . I only get a percentage of the money . I have to give them the rest . If I ca n't give them your money , I have to give them your name . And believe me , they 'll think of a way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about this . I 'm going to kill you . Scotty : All right , we 're done . Right now , instead of threatening me you sl : *uld be thinking about what to say those wiseguys. scene 7 Narrator Derek was a mess on the way home . He was actually crying behind the wheel . Then he started get*ng these crazy ideas . Derek : I can sell everything I own . My car , my stereo , TV , computer . Josh : What 's that stuff worth ? Five thousand ? It 's not enough . Derek : OK . I could steal my mom 's new car and sell it to a criminal who could sell it for parts or something . Josh : That 's ridiculous . What you have to do is level with your parents . Then you can all decide what to do together . Narrator We drove to Derek 's house and told his parents what was going on . Dad ( angrily ) : Your mother and I have to talk privately about this . Can we trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 minutes ? Narrator I could n't blame his dad for being mad . Ten minutes quickly became two awful hours while we waited for Derek 's folks to come and get us . Derek just kept shaking his head . Finally , Derek 's parents appeared . Dad : Your mother and I have made a decision . Obviously , the most important thing right now is keeping this family safe . Mom : So , tomorrow morning your dad and I are going to go to the bank and get a second mortgage on the house to pay these people . Dad : It 's going to be very difficult to pay back this loan , but it 's what we have to do . Narrator : Derek and I went out and sat on the steps . I looked over at Derek . He was grinning . Derek : That was n't so bad , was it ? I knew there was a way out . Josh : A way out ? You almost got killed by gangsters . You 've bankrupted your family , all for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up you are ? Derek : Hey , Josh , I just remembered why you and I were n't friends anymore . Narrator : Derek let himself into the house . I got up and reached into his car . I had left my jacket there , and needed it for my long walk home . What I heard next gave me the shock of my life . Thug 1 : We got ta talk to you , kid . Narrator : I turned around to face two giant men . Thug 2 : You owe our boss some money , Derek . Narrator : It was two wiseguys , come to settle the score . They thought I was Derek . Josh : W-w-wait a minute . I 'm not who you think I am . Thug 1 : Derek , it 's been a long day . Let 's just calm down and work out a payment plan so we can all walk away happy . Thug 2 : So we can all walk away , period . Josh : Look , I 'm not Derek . Thug 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you want to talk about a payment plan , yes or no ? Josh : I 'm really , really not Derek ! Thug 2 : Hey , maybe he 's got amnesia . Sal , help the poor kid get his memory back . Narrator : I ca n't really remember what happened next . There was some pushing and shoving , and then I tried to run , and everything went black . I woke up in the hospital with a bruised face and a cast on my leg . Derek was staring down at me . Derek : Oh , good . You 're awake . Listen , I 'm so sorry , man . Josh : What happened ? Derek : You got shot . Those wiseguys came looking for me and they found you instead . I really do n't know what to say . Josh : The only thing I want to hear you say is goodbye . Epilogue Narrator : So that 's the story . The next day , it was in all the papers . Derek lost every scholarship offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the house , so I guess that 's like some kind of happy ending . I hear Derek gave Downsey a call and he 's in counseling . I 'm still limping around pretty badly , but I bet I 'll be back on my feet a lot sooner than Derek will . I have n't seen him in almost a year , but I did hear this one story , where someone saw Derek sitting in a pizza place saying to anyone who would listen , " I once won five thousand dollars betting on the Cubs . " Weird , huh ?
