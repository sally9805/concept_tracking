<p> Japan 's financial scandals deepened on Wednesday as prosecutors raided the central bank and arrested an influential official suspected of leaking secrets to Japanese banks . Within hours the central bank 's governor offered to resign . <p> Japanese were stunned at the unprecedented scenes shown on television of scores of law-enforcement officers marching into the Bank of Japan , one of the nation 's most powerful financial institutions . <p> Until now the central bank had been considered a force of stability , unruffled and untainted by scandals that have penetrated the Finance Ministry and an array of big commercial banks . Credibility is critical to the Bank of Japan 's effectiveness as an advocate of the nation 's monetary policy and a voice of authority , so the raid in itself was viewed as potentially very damaging . <p> It was unclear whether the arrest of the official , Yasuyuki Yoshizawa , 42 , who runs the central bank 's capital markets division , might lead to other arrests . <p> Yasuo Matsushita , the central bank governor , was not accused of wrongdoing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly before the end of the month , Japanese news services reported . <p> While prime ministers have repeatedly been brought down in this country by postwar scandals , no central bank governor has ever been . " There is no case like this among any other central bank in the developed world , " said a Japanese banker at a major commercial bank , who spoke on condition that neither he nor his institution were identified . " This is real insider trading . " <p> To many Japanese , the arrest confirmed how widely influence peddling and bribery had spread through the Government and the financial system . It also added to an increasingly uncomfortable perception here of regulators besieged and no longer able to effectively administer an economy that is the world 's second largest . <p> The raid was the latest in a series of investigations by Tokyo prosecutors aimed at purging corruption in Japanese financial circles . <p> It came little more than a month after Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and Vice Finance Minister Takeshi Komura resigned in the days after prosecutors raided the ministry Jan. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The arrest raised troubling questions about global confidence in Japan 's financial system , already haunted by banking problems from bad debts that have festered for years . Although economists and commercial bankers said they foresaw no immediate effect on Japanese economic policy or financial stability , the Tokyo stock market tumbled 1.3 percent on the news and the yen 's value dropped in currency trading . Today , stocks were down 31.76 points , or one-fifth of 1 percent , to 16,724.38 at the midday recess . <p> Mr. Yoshizawa was accused of accepting entertainment from several powerful banks , including the Industrial Bank of Japan and Sanwa Bank , in exchange for giving them advance information on the central bank 's market operations and data on its quarterly Tankan survey of business confidence , a report closely watched for views of the state of the economy . Mr. Yoshizawa denied the charges . <p> A number of senior executives in the dominant Liberal Democratic Party had been calling for the resignation of Mr. Matsushita , the central bank 's governor , mainly because of his close association with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucrat . <p> Mr. Matsushita 's five-year term as governor runs until December 1999 , and he had resisted the calls for his resignation . He initially reinforced that resistance on Wednesday , saying he felt a " grave responsibility " to restore public confidence . <p> But Prime Minister Hashimoto 's anger about the matter may have prompted a change of heart by Mr. Matsushita . <p> " I am agonizing over how we can deal with international meetings which the governor of the Bank of Japan attends , " the Prime Minister said , as reported by Tokyo Broadcasting System . Another major press organization , the Kyodo news service , quoted Mr. Hashimoto as saying : " It is extremely regrettable that the investigation has reached the center of the financial industry after the arrests of Finance Ministry officials . I am enraged . " <p> Still , Mr. Matsushita 's resignation was expected to have less impact than would a resignation , say , of the chairman of the American Federal Reserve , Alan Greenspan , because decision making in Japan is conducted on a consensus basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the Bank of Japan is still influenced by the Finance Ministry , and only won legal independence recently when legislation was passed to slightly increase its powers starting on April 1 . <p> Leaks of market-sensitive information from central banks have not been limited to Japan . Robert A. Rough , a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , was indicted a decade ago for leaking data regarding interest rates . He served six months in prison . <p> Some here said that how the Bank of Japan deals with the crisis in the next few days would be critical to deflating concerns over its ability to regain confidence . <p> " If there is an impact on confidence which investors have in the central bank , there may be far-reaching effects , " said Toru Nakakita , an economics professor at Toyo University . <p> The arrest and the raid by prosecutors were the first since the Bank of Japan was established in 1882 . About 80 officials took part in the raid , carting out boxes of documents , and many stayed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for related evidence , according to a central bank spokesman . Several other central bank officials are also believed to be the focus of prosecutors ' investigations . <p> The Bank of Japan seems to have been among the more aggressive bureaucracies here in trying to modernize its operations and become more accountable . It recently began publishing minutes of policy board meetings , and for the first time , the bank drew up a code of conduct that it released only last Friday . Beginning April 1 , central bankers will have to pay their own way when wining , dining or playing golf with business associates . <p> Mr. Yoshizawa was said to have been entertained on 59 occasions for a total of 3.18 million yen , or nearly $25,000 , by the Industrial Bank of Japan . He is also accused of accepting entertainment from Sanwa Bank on 30 occasions for a total of 1.12 million yen , or $8,700 . Four or five other institutions  --  including the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi , Sumitomo Bank and Fuji Bank  --  are also suspected of having entertained him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Kyodo before his arrest , Mr. Yoshizawa denied the accusations and said that the entertainment in question was not improper . " I recognize that it was within the scope of social courtesy , " he was quoted as having said . " I have never received excess entertainment . " Steady Drumbeat of Scandal <p> Japan 's financial industry and some Government agencies that oversee it have been repeatedly rocked over the last year by revelations of illegal or improper activities , mismanagement , institutional collapses and even suicides . <p> 1997 May  --  Tokyo prosecutors arrest present and former officials of Nomura Securities , Japan 's largest brokerage house , on charges of illegally reimbursing gangsters for trading losses . Nomura is later fined and suspended from underwriting Government bonds for five months . <p> June  --  Current and former executives and directors of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank , Japan 's second largest , are arrested on charges of providing illegal loans to gangsters . More than half the bank 's board and its new president resign . <p> July to Oct.  --  The racketeer-payoff scandal widens when prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's third- and fourth-largest brokerage houses , and arrest present and former executives of Daiwa Securities , the second largest . Nikko 's chairman , president and six other executives resign . <p> Nov.  --  Yamaichi Securities collapses . Though anticipated for months , Yamaichi 's failure revealed far more hidden losses on the company 's books than expected , caused by illegal reimbursement of some customers ' trading losses . <p> Dec.  --  The chairmen of Nikko Securities and Daiwa Securities admit that their firms paid off gangsters . The two firms are fined and suspended from underwriting Government bonds for four months . Daiwa 's fine is larger because the company initially obstructed the investigation . <p> 1998 Jan.  --  Prosecutors raid the Finance Ministry and arrest two officials on charges that they accepted bribes in the form of lavish entertainment from institutions they supervised in exchange for preferential treatment . The Finance Minister , Hiroshi Mitsuzuka , and the senior civil servant in the ministry resign within days . A bank inspector who had been summoned by investigators kills himself before he can be interviewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance Ministry official who was about to be arrested in the bribery scandal kills himself . <p> Prosecutors say they have evidence that all three of Japan 's surviving Big Four securities houses and a number of banks offered bribes to an official of a Government-owned highway company to get bond underwriting business . <p> March  --  Two Finance Ministry officials are arrested on charges of giving banks advance warning of inspections in exchange for lavish entertainment . <p> Prosecutors raid the Bank of Japan , the nation 's central bank , and arrest officials there on charges of tipping off commercial banks about the central bank 's planned money market activities .
