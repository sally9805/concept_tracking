Although it remains unarticulated among us , we Americans share an allegiance to schools , an assumption that schools are the foundation of our meritocracy and the prime prerequisite to a satisfying existence . In fact , to the oft-cited triumvirate of what is ineluctable in life ? birth , death , and taxes ? we are prone to add an unspoken fourth : education in classrooms . In my classroom at a public high school in an upper-middle-class milieu where education is taken relatively seriously , we read with great purpose precisely those stories that tacitly reaffirm this loyalty to schools : In Lord of the Flies a pack of schoolboys degenerate into killers because no teachers are around to preserve the constraints of civilization . In To Kill a Mockingbird the venerable Atticus Finch insists that , for all of its shortcomings ? and despite the fact that his daughter , Scout , is best educated by his own good example and by life in the larger web of Maycomb County ?

The daily implacability with which the media report the decline of schools , the constant knell of ominous statistics on the sorry state of American education , the curious popularity of such books as E. D. Hirsch 's Cultural Literacy and Allan Bloom 's Closing of the American Mind , are signs and portents , yes ? but they also serve to bolster our shared assumption that school is required not merely because we attended it but also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our national discussion about education is a desperate one , taking place , as it does , in an atmosphere of crisis , but it does not include in any serious way a challenge to the notion that every child should attend school . Why ? Because , quite simply , there is no context for such a challenge : We live in a country where a challenge to the universal necessity of schools is not merely eccentric , not merely radical , but fundamentally un-American . Yet there are those who have challenged not exactly the schools ' raison d ' ? tre but the reason for their children 's being in them . The children of such people have come to be called by a powerful misnomer , by a Newspeak conjoining : " homeschoolers . " These children are not really homeschoolers at all but rather young persons who do not go to school and are educated outside of institutions , persons best defined by what they do n't do as opposed to what they do . There are currently about 300,000 homeschoolers in the United States ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following in the footsteps of Thomas Jefferson , Thomas Edison , Woodrow Wilson , Margaret Mead , and Andrew Wyeth. 58 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE /NOVEMBER 1990 A substantial majority of homeschooling parents in America are fervently religious and view schools as at odds with Christian doctrine . Overall , however , they are a diverse lot ? the orthodox and the progressive , the Fundament. talist Christian and the libertarian , the urban , the rural , the social skeptic , the idealist , the self-sufficient , and the paranoid . And studies show little or no correlation between the degree of religious content in a homeschooling program or the level of its formal structure ? ranging from orthodox " structuralists , " with homes set up as miniature schools , to informal programs guided only by a child 's ability to learn ? or the education or affluence of homeschooling parents ( or lack of affluence ; the median annual income of homeschooling families is somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 ) and the surprising academic success of home .. schooled children , who tend to score well above average on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that teaching one 's own was the norm in the United States until the 1830s ? homeschooling today is little more than a fringe movement , an uprising perceived by many as a sort of insult and by others as a severe admonishment : Take more interest in your children , like us ! ( A Gallup poll revealed that 70 percent of the American population disapproved of homeschooling . ) The movement inspires guilt in the hearts of too many parents ? a lot of them haby boomers energetically seeking money and success yet worried that their children are growing up estranged from them ? guilt and the sort of rage normally reserved for heretics and cultists . Few people realize that the homeschooling movement is populated by a large number of educators or ex-educators ? parents who teach or who have taught in the schools but keep their children out of them . Their paradoxical behavior makes them at first a curiosity and finally an affront to the schools that hired them ; their students are confounded by their apparent hypocrioverride our parental instincts ; school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to visit the local kindergarten ( to no avail ? its principal 's policy forbade such visits ) in order to assure herself that nothing dreadful might occur within its walls .

And this was true : l could deduce nothing . I wish I could write that my wife and I had excellent reasons for deciding to homeschool . We did n't . It was in the gut , and the gut , we knew , could be wrong either way . In May of 1986 we read books , in June we talked , July we wrung hands , August felt deep and hot and still , September came , and then one morning the big yellow bus arrived , waited a minute with its doors open , and our child did not get on it .

Not schoolteachers , they replied . But since then , each of our three sons has missed the bus , so to speak , and we find ourselves flung headlong into a life neither of us would have predicted . As it turns out , it is a life our family likes , end up on the table , and we might be there for two hours or more , eating , asking questions , looking up precise answers , discovering how oil is formed in the ground , why people fight over it , how Islam differs from other religions , why a person has to drink more water when it 's hot , and why camels have humps .

My wife and I hope that they will continue in this , that adolescence will find them still earnestly seeking , that they will see enough of schools ? by visit , - ing them ? to know what they are missing . We hope that colleges , if college is what they want , will recognize their strengths without school transcripts . ( Admissions boards , incidentally , increasingly recognize homeschooled children as legitimate candidates . ) And that their social lives will continue to be vigorous and sane , will continue to include people of all sorts and all ages . And finally that the life we have developed as a family will sustain itself on through their children , that our intimacy will not end when they are parents . It is not always , of course , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Much of the time , though , it is satisfying and full , a fruitful existence for us all . We recognize that in the long run it may have drawbacks , but in the long run no life is perfect . We ca n't know , finally , if this is what is best for our children and , like all parents , we are playing it by ear to some extent , hoping to guess correctly what it is we should do . We do know that homeschooling has given us a life we would n't otherwise have , and we are thankful for that . At the same time , I go on teaching English also profess skepticism at the very mention of homeschooling . Flow are your kids going to make friends ? they ask . Who 's going to teach them algebra ? How do you expect them to get into college ? When do you find time to teach them anyway ? What if you were n't a teacher ? could you do it ? Why are you here , Mr. Guterson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the approving voice of a high school English teacher . But answering them I feel the orbit of my reasoning widen ? what high school students call " digression " ? because in the end you ca n't discuss homeschooling as if it were divorced from other raging social issues . In fact , bring it up with your students ' parents and you 're soon fending off a touchy debate about such sacred matters as work , children , money , leisure time , and , above all , the self . Before long you are listening to hysterical pronouncements about democracy , capitalism , enculturation , the Japanese , and nearly everything else . Let 's take , for example , the assertion that children who do n't go to school wo n't be " socialized . " Most people believe school is the primary training ground for the social life we experience when we emerge from school : In its halls and classrooms , these skeptics recollect with mixed emotions , one sorts out the broad panoply of human types and then adjusts oneself to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great shifting tide of humanity . In this vision of things , the homeschooled child figures as an eternal outsider who , because he or she never attended school , will remain forever uninitiated in the tricky nuances of adult society . He will miss his cues at cocktail parties , he will not understand the subtleties of behaviors that come his way at the office or on the bus . Furthermore , say homeschooling 's detractors , homeschooling is undemocratic . They take at face value the portrait of schools as the irreplaceable agents of enculruration and , as E. D. Hirsch would have it , of cultural literacy . Jefferson 's vision , after all , was that school would be democracy 's proving ground , a place where all comers would take their best shot at the American Dream and where that dream would ultimately find its most basic and most enduring sustenance . Not ro show up at all ? at all ! ? is thus to give in to the forces of cultural decline , to withdraw at the moment of national crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best response is not to douse the flames or even to fiddle away beside the baths but ro go home and lock the door . Critics of homeschooling are likely to add that for America to work we must act in concert to repair our schools ; that few parents are , REPORT 6l Evidence in support of homeschooling 's academic virtues is both overwhelming and precisely what we would expect if we gave the matter some reflection . Public educators have complained , into a steady , implacable wind , that with much smaller classes and more one-to-one contact they might make better academic headway . Small wonder , then , that homeschoolers score consistently well above the norm on standardized achievement tests : They 're learning under the ideal conditions ? alone or in groups small enough to make real learning possible ? that schoolteachers persistently cry out for . Recently , a strong case has been made that achievement tests do n't tell us anything that matters , because they are culturally biased and because they are tests ? and tests are attended by various levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here some facts about homeschoolers are in order : They come predominantly from the very middle-class backgrounds that standardized achievement tests reportedly favor , and their parents are , for the most part , deeply interested in their education as well as themselves better educated than the average American adult . Thus , homeschoolers ' test scores might best be compared with those of schoolchildren who come from similar test-favoring backgrounds and whose parents also are well educated and involved . Furthermore , it 's true that some homeschooling parents teach " to " standardized tests ? some classroom teachers do also ? because states require that their children take them or because college entry is largely contingent on test scores in the absence of a school grade-point average , ( Harvard , for example , admits homeschooled children and takes their SAT scores very seriously . ) Researchers have probed as well the more slippery question of whether homeschooled children are properly socialized . John Wesley Taylor V , using the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale ? a measure of the " central core of per-sonality " ? concluded that " few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed them in the " well-adjusted " range on a personality measure known as the Roberts Apperception Test for Children ; Jon Wartes , in surveys of 219 Washington State homeschoolers , found that at least half spent more than twenty hours a month in organized community activities and that more than two thirds spent twenty to thirty plus hours a month with other children of varying ages . Linda Montgomery , after studying the leadership skills of homeschooled children , concluded that " homeschooling is not generally repressive of a student 's potential leadership , and may in fact nurture leadership at least as well as does the conventional system . " In my experience , homeschoolers are less peer-dependent than schoolchildren and less susceptible to peer pres-sure . In this regard , the research merely cor-roborates what seems to most observers obvious . But although homeschooling may work , it is by no means easy . Most American adults are ful-ly competent , of course , to learn whatever they have to learn ? facts , skills , methods , strate-gies ? in order to teach their children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strive to be good at it , and they should face the endeavor seriously . It should bring them satisfaction ; it should feel like important work . No one should undertake to homeschool without coming ro terms with this fundamental truth : It is the fab-ric of your own life you are deciding rh r . about , not just your child 's education . is matter the fabric of a homeschooling life ? is the concern of some critics who assert that in practice homeschooling is patently sexist , that its most obvious result is the isolation of women in the home , away from the fulfillments of the workplace . ( That there may be fulfillments in the home , for both sexes , as educators of children , is another issue entirely . ) Yet the question of who does what in a relationship is no more or less important with regard to home-schooling than with regard to anything else : who works outside the home , who works inside , who does the dishes , changes oil in the car , shops for food , flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who does what remains : who takes responsibility for the child 's introduction to long division , drives her to swimming lessons , teaches him to throw a baseball , shows her how to use a calculator . Homeschooling is , in fact , no more inherently sexist than anything else in a marriage ( and is less so than schools ) , and if in many homeschooling families the mother is the prime mover and first cause of education and the father an addendum and auxiliary , this is a reflection on the culture at large and not on the phenomenon of homeschooling . There are others who assert that although homeschooling might serve well for the American middle class , other groups ? the poor , the disenfranchised , the immigrant ? need schools to flourish . After all , the public schools have historically been a crucial conduit of upward mobility , they say , and point out the Vietnamese immigrants of the last twenty years , whose kids get full scholarships from places like the University of Texas and Columbia . Yet the mobility they describe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country , and schools do as much as any other institution to reinforce this state of affairs . By systematizing unfairness , inequality , and privilege , schools prepare the children of the underclass to accept as inevitable the coming drudgery of their adult lives . At my school , for example , " basic " students are more likely to serve meals in Foods I while " honors " ? students join an organization called Future Business Leaders of America and enroll in courses like Leadership and Humanities . In both its social and academic structure , my school best instructs the disenfranchised in the cruel truth that disenfranchisement is permanent . To say that homeschoolers , for the sake of American democracy , must be institutionalized is an undemocratic proposition . Both the courts and state governments recognize this , for home-schooling , is legal in one form or another everywhere in the United States . The Supreme Court thus far has not ruled in any explicit way on homeschooling . The closest it came , in 1972 , was to declare that Wisconsin 's compulsory-education law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send their children to high school . Yet legal tension about homeschooling persists ? mostly as First , Ninth , and Fourteenth Amendment issues : freedom of religion and the right to privacy ? for the states have an interest in seeing children educated and are , rightly , concerned that in at least some cases " homeschool " ends up meaning no school . ( When homeschooling parents in question are deemed incompetent , the courts have consistently ? and properly ? ruled against them . ) Moreover , and more importantly , does anyone 1 really believe that schools make students better democrats ? Do they serve the individual and democratic society ? I give them an A only for prompting peer-group relations of a sort conducive to the workings of our economy : Schools are in their social fabric nasty , competitive , mean-spirited , and status-conscious in the manner of the adult institutions they mimic . Could there be something in the very nature of the school as an institution that prevents it from fully realizing its mandate to inform , edu-cate , and develop both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it another way , could there be something in its manner of being that prevents it from realizing its reason for being ? At the high school where I teach , as at most , students come and go in sets of thirty or so at approximately one-hour intervals , an arrange-ment convenient to the daunting task of admin-istering a crowd of more than 800 young people but not necessarily conducive to their edu-cation or in the best in-terests of society . The arrangement is instead both relatively expedi-ent and indicative of the schools ' custodial function ? in essence , their primary one , since we have structured schools in such a manner as to allow this function to precede all others . Schools keep students first , and any education that happens along the way is incidental and achieved against the odds . It may be , finally , that schools temporarily prevent us from getting the education we persist in getting outside and beyond schools , where the conditions of life provide more natural motivations and learning is less abstract . Never let your schooling get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who never attended school . he school I reach in is fortunate to employ some excellent teachers , honorable and earnest men and women who are quietly heroic for the sake of their students and whose presence does much to salvage some good from an otherwise untenable institution . They bring humanity to an inhumane setting and pit it against the design of schools , which were envisioned as factories dedicated to the efficient production of predictable , formulaic human beings . But I find myself , like many teachers , beating my bead against the classroom wall on a daily , even hourly , basis . My students are compelled to herd themselves from room to room , to sit in daily confinement with other people of precisely of the industrialized twentieth century , but it is also convenient for our current generation of young parents , which might best be characterized in general terms as terrifyingly selfish , persistently immature , and unable to efface its collective ego for the sake of the generation that will follow it and is already following it . While these people go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracting everything they can from it ? their children ( they can hardly believe they have children , can hardly grasp the privilege of nurturing them when they are so thoroughly occupied by their attentions to themselves ) need someplace to go . The truth is that for too many contemporary parents the school system is little more than convenient day care day care they can feel good about as long as they do n't reflect on it too deeply . Many parents I know put more hours into their golf games or their wardrobes or into accumulating enough capital for the purchase of unnecessary luxuries than into their child 's education . Because they are still children themselves , it simply does n't occur to them to take an active role in their child 's learning in part because they expect the schools to do it all , in part because there is n't room in their souls for anybody to loom as large as themselves . For many the solution is simply to buy an education as one buys a BMW ? your child 's school as yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeschooling I am talking about choosing less affluence in the name of more education . I am talking about giving matters intense and vital thought before one ships one 's child off to school . And while it 's easy ? and understandable ? for parents to protest that one has n't the time or energy for homeschooling , there is much , short of pulling children out of school , that parents can undertake today . Homeschooling is only the extreme form of a life in which all of us can and should take part . The notion of parents as educators of their children is , in the broad sense , neither extreme nor outlandish , and we should consider how instinctively parents engage in the instruction of their children ? at the dinner table , for example ? and how vital a role an expanded homeschooling movement might play in repairing families . We should think clearly about the problems of schools , ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to fail , replace in our hearts the bankrupt notion of " quality time " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should recognize that schools will never solve the bedrock problems of education because the problems are problems of families , of cultural pressures that the schools reflect and thus can not really remedy . Today it is considered natural for parents to leave their children 's education entirely in the hands of institutions . In a better world we would see ourselves as responsible and our schools primarily as resources . Schools would cease to be places in the sense that prisons and hospitals are places ; instead , education would be embedded in the life of the community , part of the mechanics of our democracy , and all would feel a devotion to its processes . Parents would measure their inclinations and abilities and immerse themselves , to varying degrees and in varying ways , in a larger educational system designed to assist them . Schools ? educational resource centers ? would provide materials , technology , and expertise instead of classrooms , baby-sitters , and bureaucrats . Admittedly , I am a professional educator , part of this vast bureaucracy . Yet I see no contradiction in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are , attempting within the constraints of the institution to see to their education . Each year I come to admire many of my students , to like them so well that I am sad to see them go ; each year there are moments in which I am gratified , even moved , by a sentence a student has written in an essay , by a question somebody asks . Yet for all this , for all the quiet joys of the classroom , I am forever aware of some amorphous dissatisfaction , some inkling that things might be better . It seems to me that many of my students should simply be elsewhere , that they would be better served by a different sort of education , that their society would be better served by it , too . I believe this education is one their parents can best provide and that they should expect schools to assist them . These parents love their children with a depth that , finally , I ca n't match ? and finally , teaching is an act of love before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
