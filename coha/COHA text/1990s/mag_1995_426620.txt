Section : skin fitness <p> You apply your favorite perfume behind your ears as always . By mid-morning , you 're aware of a tickling sensation . By noon , it 's a downright itch . It ca n't be the perfume you 've been wearing for months . Or can it ? Dermatologists say that 's exactly what it could be . Fragrance is a wonderful way to give your spirits a lift , create a mood , even enhance your sense of well-being . Unfortunately for some people , their reaction is n't in spired  --  it 's itchy  --  and it can strike at any time . If you get the itch , you do n't have to resign yourself to living fragrance-free . Either the right fragrance or the right way to wear it can out smart a bothersome reaction . ' IT NEVER BOTHERED ME BEFORE ! " <p> An allergic " contact dermatitis " reaction usually does n't appear until you 've worn a fragrance for a time , because your body must first learn to " recognize " the offending component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in contact with that ingredient , the skin becomes increasingly sensitive to it . Finally , one day you start with a spritz of cologne and end up with a rash . <p> The good news is that you 're not allergic to perfume as a whole , but rather to one ingredient . The bad news is that discovering exactly which ingredient it is can be a painstaking process . So , no , you wo n't be able to just spray on your old favorite anymore . In fact , you 'll react the same , itchy way to any new scent ( or scented lotion , detergent or whatever ) that contains the offending component . And you 'll react quickly ; you could have the allergic contact dermatitis reaction on the first day . <p> " If it 's a true allergic contact dermatitis , you could notice itching , scaling , inflammation and redness . It 's almost always mild , " says Mary Lupo , M.D. , associate clinical professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans . " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " THE COMPONENT CULPRIT <p> If you 're really determined to track down the culprit , dermatologists can use a patch test kit that has a fragrance mix of some of the most common sensitizers , including musk among brette ( notoriously sensitizing ) , cinnamic alcohol , cinnamic aidehyde , coumarin , oak moss absolute and hydroxycitronellal . The test consists of mixing each of these components in a little petrolatum , putting it on the skin , covering it for 48 to 72 hours and then looking for reactions . But proof positive of an allergy to one ingredient does n't solve your problems . <p> " Fragrance packages are not like food packages , with all the ingredients neatly listed , " says Dr. Lupo . " With any perfume , its exact ingredients are a heavily guarded industry secret  --  only some are listed . If we confirm that you 're allergic to one particular component  --  say cinnamic alcohol , we go back to the manufacturer and ask if cinnamic alcohol is in the offending perfume . They 'll say yes or no , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , because they 're concerned with being copied . <p> " Allergic reactions to fragrances are usually not severe and are easily reversed , " says Dr. Lupo . " If , however , your reaction is a severe or chronic problem , your best step is to visit your dermatologist . The immediate concern is to soothe your irritated skin . Then you can decide if you want to try to find a fragrance that does n't bother you or find a totally different way to wear your fragrance . " SOOTHING SENSITIZED SKIN <p> Since fragrance allergies are usually mild , an OTC cortisone preparation and some simple precautions may take care of them in typical cases . " Avoid putting hot water on the area . And never put soap in contact with skin that 's having an allergic reaction , " says Dr. Lupo . " It 's too harsh and aggravates the inflammation , because it strips oil from the skin . <p> " A great home remedy for contact dermatitis is cool milk compresses , " says Dr. Lupo . " You put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk off with cool water . There 's something  --  maybe the lactic acid  --  about milk that 's very soothing . " <p> Definitely see your dermatologist if your skin blisters or becomes discolored ( if the skin tone gets lighter or darker ) , or if there 's any sign of infection ( oozing , crusting or drainage ) . If you use the home remedy for a couple of days and you still have a problem , then you should see a dermatologist , says Dr. Lupo . TRIAL AND ERROR <p> People whose skin is sensitive should experiment with different scents . " Remember , you may be allergic to only one component of a fragrance , not fragrance itself , " says Annette Green , president of the Olfactory Research Fund . " It 's similar to a food allergy . If I were allergic to strawberries I would n't stop eating all fruit . As an intelligent fragrance wearer , it 's the same principle . " <p> For testing , take advantage of sam pie sizes . If you can apply a fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm at the bend of the elbow , without experiencing any sensitivity , it 's probably fine for you . To help strengthen the odds in your favor , try something in a different fragrance family . For instance , if the perfume you originally reacted to was a spicy fragrance , ask a salesperson to help you test a floral . OFF-SKIN OPPORTUNITIES <p> If you ca n't bear to cap your favorite scent , Green suggests wearing it creatively . That means wearing it near the body , but off the skin . <p> One of the nicest ways to " wear " fragrance is in specially designed jewelry , such as pendants , she says . " There are contemporary pieces as well as older pieces that you can pick up at flea markets . " <p> Your hair is another nonskin opportunity . A dab of fragrance right from the applicator onto your hair ( being careful to avoid your skin ) does the trick . For best results , hair products should be fragrance-free and your hair must be absolutely clean . " The oil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for the worse , " says Green . " I also put fragrance in the palms of my hands . Then i can smell it throughout the day . This is an area that 's not usually sensitive for most people . <p> " You can also put some on a cotton ball and tuck it in a pocket or place several tiny pieces in the hem of your garment so that as you move you 're surrounded by fragrance , " says Green . <p> A final note : Wearing perfume on your do thing is not really a good idea . Fabric distorts fragrance and the perfume could also make some stains on your clothing . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Flacons pictured , left to right , from John Gilvey Glass , L'Artisan Parfumeur and LAGOS . <p> By Pamela Boyer <p>
