Sidewalk 's New Look <P> When Microsoft 's online entertainment site , Sidewalk , made its debut in April 1997 , print publishers feared it would steal their readers and advertisers . They need n't have worried . Stung by the tepid response , Microsoft has recast Sidewalk as a Consumer Reports-style guide for everything from strollers to car stereos . The site is good for locating dealers and getting online buying advice  --  and seems to have a lot more ads . <P> Power Browser <P> Need a pointing device that can keep up with your click-and-scroll Web-browsing habits ? Kensington 's WebRacer , due out in January ( $60 ) , may do the trick . Buttons for the most common browsing functions ( back , forward , reload , stop and print ) save time , as do the four programmable buttons and small touch pad . Larger than a typical mouse , the potato-shaped WebRacer can rest on the desktop or in your hand , making it a good choice for use with WebTV devices or living-room PCs . <P> Microsoft Is Ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combative these days , but that 's not the official reason for releasing Combat Flight Simulator ( $55 ; available Nov. 5 ) , the first version of its best-selling flight sim in more than a decade to offer real fight scenes between planes . Players can choose from eight different World War II-era aircraft , then duke it out in virtual re-creations of actual battles with realistic sights and sounds . Buckle up ! <P>  --  By Anita Hamilton
