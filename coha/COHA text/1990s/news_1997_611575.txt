<p> Just down the street from the library and a preschool playground in Manassas stands a shopping center that includes a bank , a beauty salon  --  and a porn shop that boasts 10,000 adult videos , explicit magazines and an array of sex toys . <p> The combination is increasingly common in Northern Virginia , as the booming adult video industry extends its reach into suburbia . Its growth has caught the attention of local prosecutors , provoking investigations into whether the movies that adult video stores rent and sell violate " community standards " against pornography . <p> Yesterday , Fairfax officials announced obscenity charges against MVC Latenight Entertainment for the sale of a single video purchased at its new Springfield store . And earlier this month , three stores in the Prince William area , including the MVC store in Manassas , were the targets of similar charges . <p> In both counties , citizens panels have been reviewing videos selected by prosecutors to determine whether they are offensive . <p> " Obscene material offers no cultural benefit to society , " said Fairfax Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material is obscene , I do n't want businesses selling it . " <p> Leaders of the adult video industry and free-speech advocates condemn the recent round of obscenity charges , arguing that local prosecutors are misreading Northern Virginians ' standards and , in the process , violating the Constitution . <p> " We appear to be witnessing the beginning of a new censorship movement in Virginia , " said Kent Willis , director of the Virginia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union . <p> For some years , adult videos have been available in Northern Virginia , mostly through independently owned stores that have small selections of adult titles in back corners , behind their broad selections of mainstream Hollywood titles . <p> More recently , as industry giants such as Blockbuster have increased competition for mainstream audiences , any smaller stores have increased their adult video stocks , and some small chains , such as Forbes Video , with 12 outlets in Northern Virginia , have put adult videos in some stores for the first time . <p> " More people are offering this material , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in multiple complaints , " said John Notarianni , an assistant commonwealth 's attorney in Prince William . <p> Nationwide , the adult video trade has grown dramatically , ballooning from a $ 1.6 billion industry in 1992 to $ 3.9 billion last year , according to California-based Adult Video News . Adult films now represent 13 percent of the overall video market , up from 11 percent in 1993 . About 7,800 new adult titles were released last year . <p> Adult films have been a leading part of the home video industry since it began in the late 1970s and are credited with helping to popularize VCRs . But it is only more recently that such videos have moved more into the mainstream , according to Mark Kernes , an editor at Adult Video News . <p> " Adult video spurred the near saturation of VCRs in the United States , " Kernes said . " You go down and rent ' Dumbo ' for the kids and ' New Wave Hookers ' for yourself and the wife . " <p> A survey by The Washington Post found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-core adult videos . The stores were found in communities that include Centreville , Fairfax City , Arlington , Falls Church , Alexandria , Dumfries and Woodbridge . <p> What has most caught the attention of local officials is the rapid expansion of Manassas-based MVC Latenight , which features only adult products . <p> MVC now has seven stores in Fairfax and Prince William , each with at least 10,000 adult titles , as well as magazines and sex toys . The MVC stores , with their blacked-out windows , have infuriated county supervisors , who previously paid little attention to mom-and-pop video stores that had a handful of adult titles . <p> " We do n't want this kind of material in our neighborhoods , " said Fairfax County Supervisor Elaine N. McConnell ( R-Springfield ) , who pushed for a police investigation after MVC opened a store in Springfield last year . " We are a family-oriented community here . " <p> Owners of independent video stores say they have no option but to rely on the adult video market for their survival . They have difficulty competing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer thousands of films but no sexually explicit titles . <p> " I would not be here in business today if it were not for adult video , " said Gary Boyd , owner of Countryside Video in Sterling . " Nearly 75 percent of my business during the week is adult rentals . " <p> In Fairfax , the influx of adult video stores has added to worry among local officials that problems usually associated with urban areas are increasingly threatening the county 's quality of life . <p> " If you are trying to say , ' Come and locate your business , your family in this friendly , growing community , ' an adult video store is not what you want , " said Fairfax Supervisor T. Dana Kauffman ( D-Lee ) . " It says the exact opposite . " <p> MVC , which says it has 50,000 members , decides where to open its stores by studying the Zip codes of its customers , said its general manager , John Kenney , who is the husband of the chain 's owner , Shannon Biggs . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one in the shopping center on Breeder Avenue in Manassas , started as a traditional family video shop , complete with Disney titles . But Kenney said he and his wife converted the store to adult-only titles by 1992 , after they realized that 's what their customers wanted . <p> " If the community was against it , we would not be prospering , " Kenney said . " We are providing a community service . " <p> Prosecution of video store owners is generally based on the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Miller v. California , which concluded that obscenity must be defined , at least in part , by community standards . It 's generally up to prosecutors to figure out what the community thinks is improper . <p> Given that standards differ among communities , that has meant hard-core videos are largely unavailable in places such as Cincinnati and Oklahoma City  --  where the Oscar-winning 1979 film " The Tin Drum " was recently declared obscene and seized by authorities  --  while they can be rented or purchased throughout New York City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade , passing zoning regulations that restrict stores that deal mostly in adult material to certain parts of the city . The zoning ordinance has been challenged by store owners , but so far , it has been upheld by the courts . <p> Virginia law defines an item as obscene if the dominant theme " appeals to a prurient interest in sex " and if the item is " utterly without redeeming social value " and " patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards . " <p> Maryland has a similar law , and there has been sporadic opposition to adult video stores , including a five-year battle over a Max Wonder store on Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring ( now called Bigg Wolf II ) and more recent protests against the Pack Shack , a new store on Route 40 in Ellicott City . <p> But Maryland State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli and I. Matthew Campbell , the deputy state 's attorney in Montgomery County , said they knew of no obscenity investigations of stores in Washington 's Maryland suburbs . <p> In Fairfax and Prince William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used special grand juries or panels of local volunteers to review material stocked at video stores , asking them whether it violates the community 's standards . <p> In Prince William , a panel of 12 residents chosen by the prosecutor was asked to review six videos bought by local police . <p> In one tape , a man in a car pulls up to a young woman dressed in a cheerleader 's uniform and , after inviting her to climb in for an " interview , " takes her home and talks her into having sex . In a second , three pregnant women have sex with men . <p> Four of the films were deemed obscene by the group , and based on that finding , the commonwealth 's attorney 's office filed misdemeanor charges against three county stores that carried the titles : MVC , Video Connection in Manassas Park and Video Palace in Manassas . If convicted , the stores face a maximum fine of $ 2,500 for each violation . <p> Jeffrey J. Douglas , executive director of the Free Speech Coalition , says it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much impact . <p> " The notion that we should return to this wonderful America , an Ozzie and Harriet world that never existed , is ludicrous , " said Douglas , whose organization represents the adult film industry . " We are a nation of voyeurs and exhibitionists , who want privacy in our voyeurism . " <p> Steve Mai , the manager of Video Connection in Manassas Park , said he is frustrated by what he sees as the arbitrary nature of the process . The movies that his store rents are the same ones carried by other stores , he said , and those cited as indecent are similar to many others that were n't . <p> " If we had a guideline of what we should carry or what we should sell , we would follow the guidelines , " he said . " We thought we were doing what everybody else was doing . " <p> Prince William Commonwealth 's Attorney Paul B. Ebert said that just because a product sells well does n't mean it meets community standards for decency . He acknowledged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners . <p> " That 's a problem that they face , " Ebert said , " but that 's their problem . "
