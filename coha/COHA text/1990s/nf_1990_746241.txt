Without a doubt , traditional standardized tests offer tremendous advantages : They are carefully constructed by experts and normed on large , representative samples ( Jensen 1981 , p. 14 ) ; they are easy and relatively inexpensive to administer ; and they are objective and lend themselves to machine-based scoring . Furthermore , they offer the public an easily understood report card on how well schools are doing . Their overwhelming virtue appears to be that they provide a reliable measure of accountability for the educational leadership , politicians , and the public-at-large . <p> Several serious disadvantages , however , need to be noted : Standardized tests often fail to measure what they purport to measure ; they exaggerate the significance of isolated facts ; they tend to ignore higher-level thinking skills and discourage divergent response ; they fail to deal with individual learning styles ; and they consume inordinate amounts of classroom hours and educational resources . What is more , they have become so important in the attitude formation of politicians and the public that the de facto classroom curriculum is molded in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement tests are thought to be representative of the knowledge base students are expected to have learned . As Koretz ( 1989 ) noted , a test 's value " depends on the confidence with which you can generalize from a score on the test to a corresponding degree of mastery of the broader domain of interest . " Because each form of the test provides only a sample of the knowledge in question , Koretz reported ( p. 34 ) that different but supposedly equivalent versions can and do produce very different results . <p> Furthermore , the advantage of objective and easily accomplished scoring leads to one of the major limitations of these instruments , that is , the trivialization of the knowledge tested . The concise , clearly delimited response is emphasized ; critical thinking , analytical skills , and conceptualization are all but ignored . Multiple-choice and fill-in responses are preferred ; exposition and creativity are penalized . Thus , short-term objectives dependent on memorization are most likely to be measured ; the long-term goals of reflective thought and understanding are bypassed . Ultimately , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is most significant . <p> The advantages of standardized tests have apparently outweighed the disadvantages , for their use has soared in the 1980s . A report recently issued by FairTest indicated that approximately 100 million standardized achievement tests were administered in the 1986-87 school year ( Rothman 1990a ) . The accelerated use of standardized tests has reached down even into the kindergarten , affecting decisions concerning whether youngsters will be promoted to first grade . According to the New York Public Interest Research Group ( 1989 ) , 75 percent of New York schools surveyed test their kindergarten pupils . By the second grade , 93 percent of the students are tested . Testing has become a multi-billion dollar industry . The Educational Impact of Testing <p> The very structure of education  --  the what , how , and why  --  has been distorted by these tests . The content of classroom instruction has been directed toward fulfilling the objectives implied by the tests rather than by the goals of the curriculum . Efforts to open classroom activities to discussions of issues , creative expression , and divergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct answers . In the process , we seem to have lost sight of long-standing , traditional values of American education . In particular , we have abandoned the fostering not only of creativity but also of individuality , concluding that our children must all march to the same beat set by standardized tests . The intolerance for ambiguity and uncertainty that these tests support in the young are , in effect , training them for irrelevance ; few contemporary problems of any significance have the kind of simple , certain answers that have come to dominate the educational experience . <p> We are not alone in recognizing this state of affairs . There is a growing cohort of professional educators objecting to what they perceive to be excessive reliance on grievously flawed instruments . Recently , the Council for Basic Education , the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education , the American Federation of Teachers , the National Association for the Education of Young Children , and the National Association of Elementary School Principals all joined a group of prominent researchers in requesting that alternative forms of assessment be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Rothman 1990a ) . The Political Uses of Testing <p> Despite these requests , standardized measures of achievement are more extensively used than ever before . Why ? One obvious response that comes quickly to mind is that of accountability . Has education achieved the goals established for it ? Standardized tests would appear to offer an objective means for assessing how well teachers , individual schools , and the nation 's schools as a whole are functioning . Seduced by the ease with which these tests are administered and the illusory importance of the numbers they yield , we have not sufficiently examined their adequacy as a measure of educational accountability . At best , they reflect only a small portion of what American education is about . What is omitted is everything not subject to the multiple-choice questions typically used in these tests . What kind of accountability is this ? <p> The political uses of standardized measures of achievement have fostered this impression of accountability . Rather than attacking the root problems leading to academic failure , we divert our attention to comparing achievement scores among schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low-scoring schools are seen as evidence of the failure of teachers and administrators . When an inner-city school can be singled out for its high test scores , as was recently the case for the prestigious , black , private school , Xavier Prep , in New Orleans , this is seen as proof that socioeconomic factors are not critical to success and that a dedicated faculty can overcome all obstacles . Thus , educators succeed or fail , not the society upon which the schools depend . <p> Standardized tests have become a political tool , one that allows politicians to put on the mantle of educational leadership . By berating low-scoring schools or by identifying instances of improvement , politicians give the impression of being in the forefront of the fight for academic excellence . The reality is that nothing substantive is gained from standardized testing other than the improvement of some students ' test-taking skills . In Balance : The Control of Education <p> Accountability , which serves as the rationale for the growing use of standardized tests in the United States , has more to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it has to do with the pursuit of excel has to do with the pursuit of excellence . The question of where control and power shall reside is crucial to understanding the pervasive use of these instruments , despite widespread professional dissatisfaction with them . This move for control means replacing educational leadership with direction and decision making originating from the federal government and the testing industry . <p> In concert with this move is the promotion of a business model of management and a business conception of accountability as the best way of achieving reform . The success and efficiency of American business , at least in the past , has been attributed to practices based on centralized control . Efficient business managers are expected to have all aspects of their enterprise and to maintain tight rein over the functioning of each component . <p> The viability of the business model for education needs to be examined . In business , quality control means a standardized product ; in education , the achievement of quality means a highly individualized " product , " that is , independent thinkers capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative courses of action , and articulating reasoned arguments " ( National Academy of Education 1987 , p. 54 ) . The very notion of standardizing output is antithetical to the promotion of independent thought that can emerge only from a willingness to allow individuals to grow in terms of their own inclinations and capabilities . <p> The federal bureaucracy has promoted the business model incorporating centralized control . Little by little , authority has moved from the classroom to the school office to the central administration to the state house and on to the federal government and the billion dollar testing industry . True to business practice , management blames current deficiencies on the work force , which in education means the teachers , and measures performance quantitatively , which in education is gauged by standardized test scores . <p> Although control is being centralized , resources for educational improvement are not moving from national coffers to local school districts . What meager funds are forthcoming are increasingly tied to performance as measured on standardized tests . Repeatedly , proposals are put forth recommending that monetary awards to schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as though commission incentives used with employees in the insurance , car sales , and junk bond industries would be an appropriate model for the nation 's educational profession . NAEP 's Role in a National Agenda for Education <p> It should be noted , in regard to this trend toward centralized control over education , that P.L. 100 297 has authorized the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) to pilot , in the early 1990s , a state-by-state evaluation of eighth-grade mathematics and fourth-grade reading , which will allow for comparisons among states , districts , and even individual schools . In fact , in December 1989 , the NAEP governing board adopted a resolution asking Congress to remove entirely the prohibition against using " NAEP items and test data at the district and building levels " ( Rothman 1990c ) . Furthermore , according to Chester E. Finn , head of NAEP , the efforts of President Bush and the state governors to establish national goals have led NAEP to adopt a plan to set national standards for student performance on the tests it administers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's proposals are far-reaching . Controlling the means of evaluation is tantamount to controlling all aspects of education  --  the curriculum , the instructional methodology , and , ultimately , even the materials used . That the NAEP has set this process into motion has been noted by Congressman Martinez ( 1990 ) , who warns : <p> Since the Constitution and the law creating the U.S. Education Department established that the federal government can not control curricula , Mr. Finn proposes to drive a core curriculum indirectly through an extended NAEP . Concerned that such proposals might emerge , the House agreed to a limited , demonstration expansion of NAEP only on the condition that strong safeguards be put into P. L. 100 297 to protect the assessment 's established function and prevent abuses . This balanced and incremental role is now being attacked . <p> Controlling the curriculum through testing negates the universally held concept of the process of education , that it necessarily begins with the curriculum and the goals upon which it is based . Only after goals have been established and curriculum developed is it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The brief , highly publicized , 1989 meeting of the nation 's governors with President Bush , during which a set of national goals were discussed and variously reported in nightly news programs , hardly qualifies for the kind of in-depth , long-term planning that ought to precede the establishment of national goals-an effort , it should be noted , never before undertaken in the history of this nation . The omission of any significant participation from the public or from professional educators only makes more objectionable the short-circuiting of a national discourse for de facto goals set in the concrete of standardized tests . Resistance to a National Agenda <p> Despite what appears to be an inexorable movement toward increased centralization of educational power through testing , it is possible that this trend may be reversed . There appears to be the beginnings of a reaction to standardized testing and the control that it implies , judging from some of the actions taken recently across the country . For example , thirteen states declined to participate in the initial NAEP pilot studies in mathematics conducted in March 1990 ( Putka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has refused to join its state in submitting to the NAEP pilot tests . According to Paul LeMahieu , director of testing in the Pittsburgh public schools and former president of the National Association of Test Directors , the NAEP governing board " has ignored many educators ' requests for assessments that include fewer multiple choice items and more writing or other demonstrations of progress " ( Putka 1990 ) . Clearly , there are the stirrings of a movement to reconceptualize the nation 's testing agenda . <p> The criticisms address both the nature and function of standardized tests . Currently , numerous challenges are being made to the assertion that nationally normed tests are able to measure achievement , regardless of different situational circumstances . The assumption that a single test administered once during the year , at most , can accurately reflect the breadth and depth of student knowledge is under attack . Furthermore , despite the claims of test developers that higher-level thinking is not ignored , there is considerable evidence to the contrary . For example , an analysis conducted by the Mid-Continent Regional Educational Laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " inferring " was required in only 6 percent of all items ; " summarizing " was included in approximately 2 percent ; " ordering " was found in 6 percent ; " transposing " appeared in only 4 percent ; and " representing " was essential in 7 percent . On the other hand , Marzano and Costa ( 1988 ) found that such a low-level skill as " retrieving " ( involving the recall or recognition of information ) was required for 100 percent of all items . Their parallel examination of the California Test of Basic Skills revealed comparable findings . <p> Criticism is also targeting the way standardized tests have come to be used . Prior to the 1970s , the functions of achievement testing involved the monitoring , diagnosing , and placement of individual students ; the impact on classroom behavior was minimal ( Koretz 1989 , pp. 32-37 ) . As Koretz noted , tests are now used " to monitor , not individual children , but rather educational systems  --  programs , schools , entire districts , even states " ( p. 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what and how they teach so that their students will achieve higher scores . Teaching-to-the-test has become the order of the day . Is this the function that tests ought to serve ? Is this the way curricula should be made ? From many professional quarters , the answer to both questions is a resounding " No ! " Alternative Testing <p> Alternative forms of testing are already being implemented in several states , including Vermont , Connecticut , and California . Among the most widely used alternatives are open-ended questions , authentic performances , and portfolio collections . An educational model , different from the business model that assumes that output should be predetermined and standardized , is being fostered by this new movement . Basic to such a model is its ability to deal with indeterminancy of outcomes . It must also be sufficiently flexible to encompass performances based on reasoning , diversity , and creativity . <p> Even the NAEP has recognized that the tide is shifting . As Phyllis W. Aldrich , chair of the committee developing the framework for the pilot , state-by-state test of reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test it reading has got to change " ( Rothman 1990d ) . NAEP is planning a substantial increase in the number of open-ended items that require students to write their own responses . A special test , to be administered to some 2,000 students , will attempt to assess oral fluency by having students read a text aloud to a teacher , after which they would orally respond to questions ( Rothman 1990b ) . In addition , student portfolios of classroom work in reading will be assembled and evaluated . <p> It appears that the NAEP has acknowledged the validity of some of the criticisms made of standardized tests . It must , however , be obvious to any knowledgeable observer that the changes the NAEP is now prepared to make will undermine its claims of reliability . Although it is conceivable that inter-rater reliability could be established within a school district , obtaining the necessary consistency in scoring open-ended and quite variable responses on a national or even state level is well beyond our current competence in tests and measurement . <p> In fact , the suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single , centralized agency defes credulity . Including portfolios in a national assessment would predictably cause a logistical nightmare . Each portfolio would have to be reviewed by at least one evaluator , and evaluators nationwide would need to apply the same standards to all work if the assessment is to be at all meaningful . Although desirable , this is an undertaking that is extremely difficult to accomplish within the same school system , let alone on a national basis . Even without the portfolios , open-ended questions would make scoring infinitely more complicated because a high degree of subjectivity would have to be introduced into the assessment process . Thus , machine scoring would be rendered impractical . By incorporating open-ended items in its standardized tests , NAEP would lose many of the advantages of standardization noted at the beginning of this article  --  in particular , reliability . <p> Surely , the experts at NAEP know all of this . Then why are they proceeding in this direction ? What is clearly at issue here is not only who shall control testing but also who shall control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a movement still in its embryonic stage , involves not merely a question of changing format but of solidifying federal control . While the alternative testing movement is trying to achieve evaluations sensitive to diversity ( both cultural and individual ) , to complex , higher-level thinking skills , to divergent response , and to originality , the NAEP is essentially making a political move intended to fend off a major threat to centralization . <p> Political agendas aside , if assessment is to go beyond the traditional , quantitative measurement of relatively low-level skills , then centralized control of alternative testing is the antithesis of what is needed . Alternative evaluation must emerge from a fundamental understanding of the circumstances and environmental factors undergirding children 's performance . Standardization and national control inevitably blur such critical distinctions as ethnic diversity , socioeconomic conditions , and unique regional circumstances as well as differences in learning styles and personality . Standardized tests ignore and sometimes penalize independent thought and originality ; alternative assessments seek out qualitative factors , recognizing them as essential to understanding the total intellectual performance of individual youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were feasible , what rational benefit could there be ? There is a fundamental incompatibility between such concepts as independent thought and creativity and evaluation based on national norms . Weighing the original performances of students , say , in Bangor , Maine , against those in Alexandria , Louisiana , or anywhere else , yields nothing of value for the student , the schools , or the nation . <p> As mentioned earlier , Vermont , Connecticut , and California are using alternative forms of testing . In addition , Arizona , Georgia , and North Carolina have moved to reduce the frequency of statewide assessments in response to criticisms of standardized tests ( Putka 1989 ) . <p> Unlike the business model , which assumes that output should be predetermined and standardized , more appropriate educational models are being fostered in this new movement . A basic characteristic of this group of models is the capacity to deal productively with indeterminancy and uniqueness of outcomes . Their flexibility is a key factor in allowing them to encompass performances based on high-level reasoning , diversity , and creativity . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual performance . Of greatest importance is the fact that locally administered , alternative tests allow productive feedback useful to schools and individual children without the onus of nationally publicized reports of failure from a federal government that refuses to help but does not hesitate to condemn . It is time to take testing out of the national political arena and return it to local educational agencies . <p>
