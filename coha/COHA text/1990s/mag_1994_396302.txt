Three years ago I stood at my sink , washing the dishes and listening to the radio . I was tuned to rock and roll so I could avoid thinking about the big news from the day before  --  George Bush had just nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court . I was squeezing a dot of lemon Joy into each of the wineglasses when I realized that two smoothly radio-cultured voices , a man 's and a woman 's , had replaced the music . " I think it 's a stroke of genius on the president 's part , " said the female voice . " Yeah , " said the male voice . " Then those blacks , those African Americans , those Negroes  --  hey " Negro " is good enough for Thurgood Marshall  --  whatever , they ca n't make up their minds what they want to be called . I 'm gon na call them Blafricans . Black Africans . Yeah , I like it . Blafricans . Then they can get all upset because now the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the way those liberals think . It 's just crazy . " " And then after they turn down his nomination the president can say he tried to please " em , and then he can appoint someone with some intelligence . " Back then , this conversation seemed so horrendously unusual , so singularly hateful , that I picked up a pencil and wrote it down . I was certain that a firestorm of protest was going to engulf the station and purge those foul radio mouths with the good clean soap of social outrage . I am so naive . When I finally turned on the radio and rolled my dial to where everyone else had been tuned while I was busy watching Cosby reruns , it took me a while to understand that there 's a firestorm all right , but not of protest . In the two and a half years since Thomas has assumed his post on the Supreme Court , the underlying assumptions of the conversation I heard as uniquely outrageous have become commonplace , popularly expressed , and louder in volume . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among acquaintances , on the street , on television in toned-down versions . It is a crude demagoguery that makes me heartsick . I feel more and more surrounded by that point of view , the assumptions of being without intelligence , the coded epithets , the " Blafrican " - like stand-ins for " nigger , " the mocking angry glee , the endless tirades filled with nonspecific , nonempirically based slurs against " these people " or " those minorities " or " feminazis " or " liberals " or " scumbags " or " pansies " or " jerks " or " sleazeballs " or " loonies " or " animals " or " foreigners . " At the same time I am not so naive as to suppose that this is something new . In clearheaded moments I realize I am not listening to the radio anymore , I am listening to a large segment of white America think aloud in ever louder resurgent thoughts that have generations of historical precedent . It 's as though the radio has split open like an egg , Morton Downey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling out , broken yolks , a great collective of sometimes clever , sometimes small , but uniformly threatened brains  --  they have all come gushing out . Just as they were about to pass into oblivion , Jack Benny and his humble black sidekick Rochester get resurrected in the ungainly bodies of Howard Stern and his faithful black henchwoman , Robin Quivers . The culture of Amos and Andy has been revived and reassembled in Bob Grant 's radio minstrelry and radio newcomer Daryl Gates 's sanctimonious imprecations on behalf of decent white people . And in striking imitation of Jesse Helms 's nearly forgotten days as a radio host , the far Right has found its undisputed king in the personage of Rush Limbaugh  --  a polished demagogue with a weekly radio audience of at least 20 million , a television show that vies for ratings with the likes of Jay Leno , a newsletter with a circulation of 380,000 , and two best-selling books whose combined sales are closing in on six million copies . From Churchill to Hitler to the old Soviet Union , it 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of history , to proselytize , and to coalesce not merely the good and the noble , but the very worst in human nature as well . Likewise , when Orson Welles made his famous radio broadcast " witnessing " the landing of a spaceship full of hostile Martians , the United States ought to have learned a lesson about the power of radio to appeal to mass instincts and incite mass hysteria . Radio remains a peculiarly powerful medium even today , its visual emptiness in a world of six trillion flashing images allowing one of the few remaining playgrounds for the aural subconscious . Perhaps its power is attributable to our need for an oral tradition after all , some conveying of stories , feelings , myths of ancestors , epics of alienation , and the need to rejoin ancestral roots , even ignorant bigoted roots . Perhaps the visual quiescence of radio is related to the popularity of E-mail or electronic networking . Only the voice is made manifest , unmasking worlds that can not  --  or dare not ?  --  be seen . Just yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupting into the expressed , the prime time . What comes out of the modern radio mouth could be the Iliad , the Rubaiyat , the griot 's song of our times . If indeed radio is a vessel for the American " Song of Songs , " then what does it mean that a manic , adolescent Howard Stern is so popular among radio listeners , that Rush Limbaugh 's wittily smooth sadism has gone the way of prime time television , and that both vie for the number one slot on all the best-selling book lists ! What to make of the stories being told by our modern radio evangelists and their tragic unloved chorus of callers ? Is it really just a collapsing economy that spawns this drama of grown people sitting around scaring themselves to death with fantasies of black feminist Mexican able-bodied gay soldiers earning $100,000 a year on welfare who are so criminally depraved that Hillary Clinton or the Antichrist-of-the-moment had no choice but to invite them onto the government payroll so they can run the country ! The panicky exaggeration reminds me of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge lion jumped out of the shadows and was about to gobble me up , and I ca n't ever sleep again for a whole week . As I spin the dial on my radio , I ca n't help thinking that this stuff must be related to that most poignant of fiber-optic phenomena , phone sex . Aural Sex . Radio Racism with a touch of S &; M. High-priest hosts with the power and run-amok ego to discipline listeners , to smack with the verbal back of the hand , to smash the button that shuts you up once and for all . " Idiot ! " shouts New York City radio demagogue Bob Grant and then the sound of droning telephone emptiness , the voice of dissent dumped out some trapdoor in aural space . As I listened to a range of such programs what struck me as the most unifying theme was not merely the specific intolerance on such hot topics as race and gender , but a much more general contempt for the world , a verbal stoning of anything different . It is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mockery and shouting down of callers , this roar of incantations , the insistence on agreement . But , ah , if you will but only agree , what sweet and safe reward , what soft enfolding by a stern and angry radio god . And as an added bonus , the invisible shield of an AM community , a family of fans who are Exactly Like You , to whom you can express , in anonymity , all the filthy stuff you imagine " them " doing to you . The comfort and relief of being able to ejaculate , to those who understand , about the dark imagined excess overtaking , robbing , needing to be held down and taught a good lesson , needing to put it in its place before the ravenous demon enervates all that is true and good and pure in this life . The audience for this genre of radio flagellation is mostly young , white , and male . Two thirds of Rush Limbaugh 's audience is male . According to Time magazine , 75 percent of Howard Stern 's listeners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives walling themselves off from any real experience with blacks , feminists , lesbians , or gays . In this regard , it is probably true , as former Secretary of Education William Bennett says , that Rush Limbaugh " tells his audience that what you believe inside , you can talk about in the marketplace . " Unfortunately , what 's " inside " is then mistaken for what 's outside , treated as empirical and political reality . The National Review extols Limbaugh 's conservative leadership as no less than that of Ronald Reagan , and the Republican party provides Limbaugh with books to discuss , stories , angles , and public support . " People were afraid of censure by gay activists , feminists , environmentalists  --  now they are not because Rush takes them on , " says Bennett . U.S. history has been marked by cycles in which brands of this or that hatred come into fashion and go out , are unleashed and then restrained . If racism , homophobia , jingoism , and woman-hating have been features of national life in pretty much all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a lot of time wondering if right-wing radio is a symptom or a cause . For at least 400 years , prevailing attitudes in the West have considered African Americans less intelligent . Recent statistics show that 53 percent of people in the U.S. agree that blacks and Latinos are less intelligent than whites , and a majority believe that blacks are lazy , violent , welfare-dependent , and unpatriotic . I think that what has made life more or less tolerable for " out " groups have been those moments in history when those " inside " feelings were relatively restrained . In fact , if I could believe that right-wing radio were only about idiosyncratic , singular , rough-hewn individuals thinking those inside thoughts , I 'd be much more inclined to agree with Columbia University media expert Everette Dennis , who says that Stern 's and Limbaugh 's popularity represents the " triumph of the individual " or with Time magazine 's bottom line that " the fact that either is seriously considered a threat ... is more worrisome than Stern or Limbaugh will ever be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to do with real oppressions , with real white and black levels of joblessness and homelessness , or with the real problems of real white men , then I would n't have bothered to slog my way through hours of Howard Stern 's miserable obsessions . Yet at the heart of my anxiety is the worry that Stern , Limbaugh , Grant , et al . represent the very antithesis of individualism 's triumph . As the National Review said of Limbaugh 's ascent , " It was a feat not only of the loudest voice but also of a keen political brain to round up , as Rush did , the media herd and drive them into the conservative corral . " When asked about his political aspirations , Bob Grant gloated to the Washington Post , " I think I would make rather a good dictator . " The polemics of right-wing radio are putting nothing less than hate onto the airwaves , into the marketplace , electing it to office , teaching it in schools , and exalting it as freedom . What worries me is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fed not by fact but fantasy . What worries me is the reemergence , more powerfully than at any time since the institution of Jim Crow , of a socio-centered self that excludes " the likes of , " well , me for example , from the civic circle , and that would rob me of my worth and claim and identity as a citizen . As the Economist rightly observes , " Mr. Limbaugh takes a mass market  --  white , mainly male , middle-class , ordinary America  --  and talks to it as an endangered minority . " I worry about this identity whose external reference is a set of beliefs , ethics , and practices that excludes , restricts , and acts in the world on me , or mine , as the perceived if not real enemy . I am acutely aware of losing my mythic individualism to the surface shapes of my mythic group fearsomeness as black , as female , as left wing . " I " merge not fluidly but irretrievably into a category of " them . " I become a suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely different but dangerous . And that worries me a lot . What happens in my life with all this translated license , this permission to be uncivil ? What happens to the social space that was supposedly at the sweet mountaintop of the civil rights movement 's trail ? Can I get a seat on the bus without having to be reminded that I should be standing ? Did the civil rights movement guarantee us nothing more than to use public accommodations while surrounded by raving lunatic bigots ? " They did n't beat this idiot Rodney King enough , " says Howard Stern . Not long ago I had the misfortune to hail a taxicab in which the driver was listening to Howard Stern undress some woman . After some blocks , I had to get out . I was , frankly , afraid to ask the driver to turn it off  --  not because I was afraid of " censoring " him , which seems to be the only thing people will talk about anymore , but because the driver was stripping me too , as he leered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he demanded , as I asked him to pull over and let me out well short of my destination . ( I 'll spare you the full story of what happened from there  --  trying to get another cab , as the cabbies stopped for all the white businessmen who so much as scratched their heads near the curb ; a nice young white man , seeing my plight , giving me his cab , having to thank him , he hero , me saved-but-humiliated , cabdriver pissed and surly . I fight my way to my destination , finally arriving in bad mood , militant black woman , cranky feminazi . ) When Yeltsin blared rock music at his opponents holed up in the parliament building in Moscow , in imitation of the U.S. Marines trying to torture Manual Noriega in Panama , all I could think of was that it must be like being trapped in a crowded subway car when all the portable stereos are tuned to Bob Grant or Howard Stern . With Howard Stern 's voice a tinny , screeching backdrop , with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gushing into their bloodstreams , I 'd start begging to surrender . Surrender to what ? Surrender to the laissez-faire resegregation that is the metaphoric significance of the hundreds of " Rush rooms " that have cropped up in restaurants around the country ; rooms broadcasting Limbaugh 's words , rooms for your listening pleasure , rooms where bigots can capture the purity of a Rush-only lunch counter , rooms where all those unpleasant others just " choose " not to eat ? Surrender to the naughty luxury of a room in which a Ku Klux Klan meeting could take place in orderly , First Amendment fashion ? Everyone 's " free " to come in ( and a few of you outsiders do ) , but mostly the undesirable nonconformists are gently repulsed away . It 's a high-tech world of enhanced choice . Whites choose mostly to sit in the Rush room . Feminists , blacks , lesbians , and gays " choose " to sit elsewhere . No need to buy black votes , you just pay them not to vote ; no need to insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . Just sit back and watch it work , like those invisible shock shields that keep dogs cowering in their own backyards . How real is the driving perception behind all the Sturm und Drang of this genre of radio-harangue  --  the perception that white men are an oppressed minority , with no power and no opportunity in the land that they made great ? While it is true that power and opportunity are shrinking for all but the very wealthy in this country ( and would that Limbaugh would take that issue on ) , the fact remains that white men are still this country 's most privileged citizens and market actors . To give just a small example , according to the Wall Street Journal , blacks were the only racial group to suffer a net job loss during the 1990-91 economic downturn at the companies reporting to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . Whites , Latinos , and Asians , meanwhile , gained thousands of jobs . While whites gained 71,144 jobs at these companies , Latinos gained 60,040 , Asians gained 55,104 , and blacks lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States tomorrow , the numbers would not be sufficient to account for white men 's expanding balloon of fear that they have been specifically dispossessed by African Americans . Given deep patterns of social segregation and general ignorance of history , particularly racial history , media remain the principal source of most Americans ' knowledge of each other . Media can provoke violence or induce passivity . In San Francisco , for example , a radio show on KMEL called " Street Soldiers " has taken this power as a responsibility with great consequence : " Unquestionably , " writes Ken Auletta in the New Yorker , " the show has helped avert violence . When a Samoan teenager was slain , apparently by Filipino gang members , in a drive-by shooting , the phones lit up with calls from Samoans wanting to tell the hosts they would not rest until they had exacted revenge . Threats filled the air for a couple of weeks . Then the dead Samoan 's father called in , and , in a poignant exchange , the father said he could n't tolerate the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no retaliation , he vowed . And there was none . " In contrast , we must wonder at the phenomenon of the very powerful leadership of the Republican party , from Ronald Reagan to Robert Dole to William Bennett , giving advice , counsel , and friendship to Rush Limbaugh 's passionate divisiveness . The outright denial of the material crisis at every level of U.S. society , most urgently in black inner-city neighborhoods but facing us all , is a kind of political circus , dissembling as it feeds the frustrations of the moment . We as a nation can no longer afford to deal with such crises by imagining an excess of bodies , of babies , of job-stealers , of welfare mothers , of overreaching immigrants , of too-powerful ( Jewish , in whispers ) liberal Hollywood , of lesbians and gays , of gang members ( " gangsters " remain white , and no matter what the atrocity , less vilified than " gang members , " who are black ) , of Arab terrorists , and uppity women . The reality of our social poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in form if not substance , phenomena like anti-Semitism in Poland : there are n't but a handful of Jews left in that whole country , but the giant balloon of heated anti-Semitism flourishes apace , Jews blamed for the world 's evils . The overwhelming response to right-wing excesses in the United States has been to seek an odd sort of comfort in the fact that the First Amendment is working so well that you ca n't suppress this sort of thing . Look what 's happened in Eastern Europe . Granted . So let 's not talk about censorship or the First Amendment for the next ten minutes . But in Western Europe , where fascism is rising at an appalling rate , suppression is hardly the problem . In Eastern and Western Europe as well as the United States , we must begin to think just a little bit about the fiercely coalescing power of media to spark mistrust , to fan it into forest fires of fear and revenge . We must begin to think about the levels of national and social complacence in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected result is , not of censorship or suppression , but of so much encouragement , so much support , so much investment in the fashionability of hate . What future is it that we are designing with the devotion of such tremendous resources to the disgraceful propaganda of bigotry ? Patricia J.
