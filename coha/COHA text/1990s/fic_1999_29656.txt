Chapter One The scream was Kait Galweigh 's first warning that something was wrong . The second , half an instant later , was the hard metallic stink of human blood mingled with the rank stench of predator . " Run ! " she heard Hasmal shout . " The gap ! " " Slings ! " " Gods , I think he 's dead ! " She heard running , and shouts , and animal howls . The smells and sounds and the terror hit her like a blow to the skull ; her body responded before her mind could . Her blood began to boil and her skin and muscles flowed like liquid , and the human part of her , which had been hunting for edible plants in the forest , Shifted to embrace the monster that lived inside of her ; she became the thing she both hated and needed . With the woman burned away , what remained was beast , furred , fanged , four-legged , hungry for the hunt . Karnee now , blood-mad , she raced toward trouble . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skidded to a stop at the sight laid out before her . The attackers had her people backed into a narrow crevice in the cliff that formed the north wall of their camp . Turben was down and bleeding heavily . The other three used the plentiful shale scree as their weapon ; they were taking turns throwing volleys against the enemy with makeshift slings , timing their fire in such a way that a constant rain of the knifelike stone shards filled the air . She could n't see her attackers , but she knew where they were from the sound of them ; they were using the ruin as their shield . They were better armed than the humans . She could hear the twang of bowstrings , the hiss of heavy arrows flying through the air , the rattle and clatter as the arrows rebounded off the cliff face and knocked loose more scree . Better armed and with their prey cornered , they could n't help but win . Unless she found a way to shift the odds in her favor . She scrambled down the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends nor her enemies would pay attention to her-four-legged , she moved differently than a human , and gave the impression she was moving away from the trouble . Once into the valley and downwind of the attackers , she came in behind them , running through the underbrush with her belly to the ground . She was fast and quiet enough that they had no warning when she burst out of the brush to attack them . She got her first clear look at them as she charged toward the nearest . They were taller than any man and gaunt as specters , and gray fur hung from their frames in ragged , moss-festooned hanks . She guessed they massed twenty to twenty-five stone-more than four times the weight and bulk of the average human . They ran on four legs but stood clumsily on two to fling rocks or shoot their arrows , and they called to each other in rough syllables that were not far removed from wordless grunts . Yet they did speak , and they did make weapons , and their faces , arranged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Wizards ' War origins . They were Scarred-monsters whose ancestors a thousand years earlier had been men . She was terrified . All her life , she 'd heard horrible stories about Scarred monsters and what they were capable of-and she knew what she was capable of , which made her give the stories credence-but in the end it did n't matter . Her friends needed her . She lunged in , keeping low to the ground and aiming straight for the rear leg of the nearest attacker , and before any of the four beasts could react to her , she 'd sunk her fangs into the tendons of the monster 's right leg and ripped through them . The monster screamed , and blood gushed in her mouth . She bounded away , feeling the surge of the Karnee battle-lust boiling in her veins , fed by the raging river of her fear and determination . The beast she 'd hamstrung was on three legs , turning to face her as quickly as he could . She could read murder in his face . Another Scarred had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darted from the cleared circle , and burst out at one of the two monsters still firing at the cornered humans . An arrow grazed her back and fire screamed through her body , but she kept going . She launched herself upward at the creature 's underbelly , her claws unsheathed and hooking forward , teeth bared . She ripped into the unprotected skin and the slippery , stinking weight of gut rolled down at her . The beast shrieked , its voice far too high-pitched for its size , and flailed at her . Her momentum carried her out of its reach , but into the path of the other two monsters . One released an arrow in her direction ; the other reached for her with dirt-crusted claws as long as her hands . The reaching monster hampered the aim of the shooting one , and the shooting one screamed at the grabbing one and startled him , and so both missed . She scrambled away before they could organize their attack , and ran out into the rain of shale . " Do n't hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pale faces of her friends peering from the protection of the crevice . " I 'm going to lead them away from camp . Hasmal-set a ... a spellfire . " She heard them shout , " Kait ! " Someone yelled , " Right ! " and she hoped Hasmal had understood what she 'd said . Her Shifted voice was deep and coarse , more the growling of an animal than the speech of a woman . Godsall , she hoped he could figure out what she planned , and that he would do what she wanted him to do . The monster she 'd disemboweled was down . But the others were after her , their long legs covering a hellish amount of ground . She charged straight for the stream that fed into the bay and leaped it . On the other side , a game trail ran parallel to the water . Kait followed it ; browsing animals had cleared much of the stream edge , so for something her size , it made easy running . The beasts that pursued her , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail at eye level . She could hear them crashing after her , falling behind . They started howling , and she could hear the frustration in their calls . She would make it . She was going to survive . She 'd have time to get down to the beach , to swim into the bay-Another monster appeared in front of her-another part of their hunting band , coming to assist its packmates . She shrieked , caught off guard , but it was n't surprised to see her . It narrowed its eyes and lunged . She barely evaded it ; she was small and fast , it was large and slower . But not slow enough . It jumped sideways to block her escape , yelling as it did . From behind her , one of the others shouted back . They talked to each other . It was too easy to think of them as animals , but they were n't . She shot straight up a solid tree , claws hooking into the bark . The monster stretched after her , its claws slashing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding pain along her spine . She dug harder with her hindquarters and pulled free . She clung to an upper branch , out of reach of the things , wishing for the safety of the bay . She was running out of time . She began the careful process of moving across the network of interfaced branches that would get her there . She heard the flat twang of a bowstring , and an arrow buried itself in her flank . She screamed , feeling the hot gush of blood down her leg and the weight of the shaft throwing off her balance . The pain was another weight , sucking the fight from her . She stared down ; one of them tracked her through the trees , waiting for another clear shot . She flung herself forward , and heard another of them crashing toward her from the side . The ones behind her were closing . Hurry with the fire , Hasmal , she prayed . If he did , her friends would survive ; they would find a way to get the Mirror to the Reborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that-Solander the Reborn had told her he had to have it . The Mirror , which was rumored to resurrect the dead , would one day give her back her murdered Family , but even before it did that , it would serve Solander 's purpose in creating his world of peace and love-the world in which her kind would be accepted , not hunted down , tortured , and slaughtered . She never thought she 'd discover something worth dying for , but a world that would not murder little children for beingborn Scarred was such a thing . Her family 's lives were such a thing . If her friends could live to get the Mirror to Solander ... She yanked the arrow from her flank with teeth and claws , and , fighting the agony , went scrambling on three legs along the branch . The Karnee Shift began closing the wound , but ate up her energy to do it . Her body would devour itself to heal ; if she lived through this , she would have a hellish price to pay . Then she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . The spellfire would n't be stopped by rain , or by live , wet wood , or by unfavorable wind . It would burn everything burnable in its path , carving a perfect circle of destruction through the forest , stopping only when the energy with which Hasmal had fueled it ran out . It would burn faster than any normal fire , reducing a full-grown tree to ashes in mere moments . If she did n't get out of its way , it would burn her , too . The stream ran below her , within reach . But the monsters held the game trails to either side of it . If she wanted to live , she had to get to the bay . She was out of time . The monsters sniffed the air , smelling smoke-but they did n't know how fast the fire would come . She did . In desperation she threw herself into the center of the flooded , icy , boulder-studded stream . The water dragged at her legs as she scrabbled to touch bottom , lifted her off her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head up . The current was fast , brutally fast , the normally negotiable water made deadly by days of rain . It slammed her into boulders as it dragged her downstream . With every bone-cracking collision she could only remind herself that worse was coming . The current spun her backward for an instant before sucking her completely under the water . In that instant , she saw the world behind her lit up like a blast furnace , blue-white fire advancing in a wall faster than the fastest man could run . She 'd seen the monsters behind her outlined by the fire . And then she was under the muddy water , caught in the fierce center of the current , dragged headfirst through blackness . She held her breath and kept her forelegs over her head , hoping to protect herself from rocks , but the current jerked her into one from the side , and when her head hit , the pain hammered her . She inhaled water and choked as the current flung her upward again , playing with her . She spewed water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wet lungs . Then everything got worse . The stream became a waterfall that plunged down the side of a cliff and poured into the bay . The current flung her over the precipice amid a torrent of pounding water . The sensation of floating seemed to last both forever and no time at all , ending abruptly in horrific pain . Her body crashed against rocks , water slammed her , and ribs and hips and legs all shattered and screamed agony at once . She was with the pain , in the pain , made of pain for an instant that was an eternity , while her blood boiled and her skin burned and a fire erupted inside of her that was hotter than the spellfire that had destroyed the world around her . Then ... Nothing . ( Continues ... )
