<p> Questions of life and death are seldom easy , as the cases discussed here illustrate . Often as people struggle with these questions , they assume positions that seem contradictory . <p> Liberals who are prepared to sacrifice fetal lives protest the execution of someone who has taken a life . Conservatives blockade abortion clinics to " rescue " embryos while crusading for tougher death- penalty laws in order to take lives . <p> Both positions are inconsistent , according to a small but growing group of supporters of what they claim is a " consistent life ethic . " <p> " Whether you 're from the right or the left , the holistic experience , the experience of seeing life as connected , is not there , " says Carol Crossed of Rochester , N.Y. , executive director of the Seamless Garment Network , which is made up of 150 organizations that oppose abortion , the death penalty , euthanasia , assisted suicide and war . About 75 percent of the organizations are religious . <p> Crossed , a Vietnam war protestor in the 1960s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-abortion activist in the 1980s . <p> By combining the " liberal " anti-war and anti-capital punishment causes with the " conservative " anti-abortion cause , she alienated people on both sides , she says . " I stepped into an area of political incorrectness . . . . It 's been extremely painful for me . " <p> The " consistent life " approach advocated by Crossed and the Seamless Garment Network got a boost this spring when Pope John Paul II delivered a forceful encyclical called Evangelium Vitae ( The Gospel of Life ) . The pope 's paper decried a spreading " culture of death , " condemned abortion and euthanasia , and said a justification for the death penalty is " very rare " if not " practically nonexistent . " <p> The encyclical begins with , " The Gospel of life is at the heart of Jesus ' message . " <p> Supporters of the ethic believe that matters of life and death are for God alone to decide . But there is sharp disagreement among people of faith on this controversial issue . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . The 15-million-member Southern Baptist Convention opposes abortion and euthanasia in resolutions , lobbying and literature . <p> The Convention has not taken a position on the death penalty . But C. Ben Mitchell , a Southern Baptist minister and medical ethicist with the convention 's Christian Life Commission , says , " My sense is that a majority of Southern Baptists would approve of capital punishment . " <p> The consistent life ethic may be consistent logically , Mitchell said , but support of capital punishment is consistent biblically . <p> " It 's our view that both the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments endorse capital punishment for capital crimes , " he said . <p> In the book of Romans , Mitchell said , the Bible said the government bears the sword . " A sword is a pretty lethal instrument , " he said . " It is hardly a rehabilitative type of tool . <p> " It 's not a vengeful kind of approach we take at all , but one we do believe derives from scripture . " <p> When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is made in the image of God . <p> Like abortion , he said , euthanasia is a human usurpation of God 's power over life . <p> " We believe , except under careful restriction , the giving and taking of human life belong to God , " Mitchell said . " Capital punishment , self- defense and just war would be the only exceptions to that . " <p> The 9-million-member United Methodist Church takes an opposite view - condemning capital punishment , while maintaining a position that leaves the decision of whether to have an abortion up to a woman and her family , physician and pastor . <p> " I think women should have the opportunity to make that decision for themselves because they have to live out the consequences , " says Hilary Shelton , a program director with the United Methodist Board of Church and Society . " Women are full persons in God 's house and under the law . Women deserve as human beings to make those decisions . " <p> Some Christians who support abortion rights cite Bible verses that say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves . <p> " I do n't think life starts at conception , " said the Rev. Anne Callison , an Atlanta Presbyterian minister . " I think life begins when a baby can breathe on its own . " <p> As to the death penalty , Shelton cites the " sanctity of life " and the danger of executing innocent people as reasons for opposition . <p> Old Testament requirements of " an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth " actually addressed fairness in lending , says Shelton , an ordained minister . And for Christians , he says , the Old Testament law is superseded by the New Testament , in which Jesus says vengeance is the Lord 's and requires that those who are wronged " turn the other cheek . " <p> " The thing that bothers me that is consistent with both issues , " he said , " is that people spend a lot of money to execute people . They spend a lot of money to keep people from deciding to have an abortion . In no case do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Science also has complicated this debate . With advances in medical technology , not only the beginning and end of life are in question , but also the definition of life itself . People of faith now must struggle with questions their ancestors could not have dreamed of . <p> For example : Is a baby without a brain fully alive ? <p> The question arose last month when a committee of the American Medical Association declared it ethically permissible to take organs from anencephalic newborns , or infants born without brains , while they are legally alive , to save other children . <p> Religious people , ethicists and even parents of anencephalic newborns are divided over the issue . <p> Before giving birth Dec. 22 , 1987 , Brenda Winner waged a highly publicized battle with an unwilling medical establishment to donate the heart and other organs of her anencephalic baby , Jarren . The baby was stillborn , but even so her corneas and heart valves were donated . <p> " People see the world as black and white and they do n't like the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resident who supports the AMA recommendation . " They do n't know what anencephaly is , what it looks like , what it can do . . . . It 's my child , and I 'm a better ethicist than anybody concerning anencephaly . " <p> But June Pitts , of Chicago , said she would never have considered organ donation from her child , Gina , who had anencephaly when she was born in 1974 . <p> " My daughter may not have had a brain , but she was a human being . She has a soul and she did respond to me , " said Pitts . " She held my finger . . . . She nursed . She opened her eyes and was looking around . " <p> Today , Pitts said , a strong religious faith helps her look with perspective on her daughter 's brief life . But even people with strong religious convictions disagree over what is appropriate for anencephalic babies . <p> Most people of faith are never faced with such a complicated life-or- death choice , however . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of smaller daily decisions , said Catherine Meeks , associate professor of American Studies and Interdisciplinary Studies at Mercer University . <p> " It 's not just the big issues , " says Meeks , a member of the board of the Seamless Garment Network . " I do n't see it as just some philosophy to talk about . I see it as a way to live . . . . How do I treat people who make me angry , who do n't do what I want them to do ? How do I think about people who do things that are unjust toward me or my family ? Do I have a murderous attitude toward them in my heart , or do I try to be reconciling ? " <p> The greatest challenge to religious believers , and to society in general , Meeks says , is not simply to take stands on complex issues such as abortion , capital punishment and war . <p> The greatest challenge , she says , " is living day-to-day to create a world where there would n't need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White covers religion for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution .
