In case you were wondering , here 's as vivid a definition of saloon songs as you 're likely to find : " They 're the ones the fellows sing in a dimly lighted club at about 2 o'clock in the morning , when everybody 's gassed .

The vintage is important : this is n't the coarse , harder-swinging Sinatra of the ' 60s or the performer of more recent decades who increasingly barked and bit his way through songs . Those Sinatras already have live albums . Here , for the first time on an official release , is Sinatra in front of an audience at close to his mid- ' 50s prime , the voice still lithe , graceful and burnished  --  and dubious hits like My Way yet to be written . <P> Sinatra has always occupied a gray area between jazz and pop .

With I 've Got You Under My Skin , Sinatra even surpasses the vocal on his famous Songs for Swingin ' Lovers version , which really belongs to arranger Nelson Riddle . And as wonderful as that studio performance is , it does n't include an audibly rapturous female audience member or an unalloyed Sinatra quip in response : " Get your hand off that broad !
