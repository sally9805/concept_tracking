<p> Dorothy D. Ford plans to wake up early this morning ; she has to get ready . In the kitchen of her Upper Marlboro town house , she will scramble dozens of eggs and fry up the sausage and bacon . She 'll put a big pot of creamy grits on the stove . The devil's-food birthday cake will have a table all to itself . <p> Before her brunch guests arrive , Ford will slip on the floaty duster she bought with this occasion in mind , because its black-and-white elephant print so perfectly matches what she feels : " Bold , strong , free ! " <p> Breathlessly , she takes measure of her life : She works full time as a management analyst at the Treasury Department and runs a wedding consultant business on the side and dabbles in telecommunications and mentors two teenage girls and studies computer graphics at Prince George 's Community College . She finds herself recently single but is at peace with that though not really ready to try again , and she is proud of her 20-year-old daughter now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must always be used . She just learned to swim and to garden , growing flowers but no vegetables , and she stands 4-feet-11 but fibs and says " five feet " while joking that " I think 6-3 . " She can wear slacks she bought in 1989 without lying down to pull the zipper and people say she looks a decade younger than she is . When she was a girl , this day seemed not just far away but " unimaginable . " <p> Glancing in the mirror  --  something she catches herself doing more often lately  --  Ford sees a face that reflects joy and gratitude and , yes , some dismay . <p> " This is going to be nice , " she declares to herself , to others , before this birthday morning finally dawns . <p> " I have no fear whatsoever about turning 50 . " <p> A baby boomer will turn 50 an average of every 7 1/2 seconds through the year 2006 , a mass production of middle age more evocative of golden arches than Golden Pond : Over 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club have a way of unsettling the collective consciousness . Cover-girl fresh Cheryl Tiegs turned 50 last month , making her a year younger than Hayley Mills and Sally Field . Yes , even Pollyanna and Gidget are in the hot-flash zone now . The maniacal Manson girls are subdued and matronly . Angela Davis seems august and Farrah Fawcett panicky . <p> In these confusing times , Hillary Clinton marks her 50th birthday tomorrow , a milestone she is loath to publicly analyze , coolly offering reporters this stock reply : <p> " I just do n't think in those terms . " <p> But for many women , 50 is a momentous occasion , and " change of life " connotes not just a medical euphemism but a spiritual mandate . Kathleen Zaffina is joining the Peace Corps ; Sandra Jowers is planning her wedding . <p> " At midlife , there is a strong need to redefine yourself , " says Deborah Potashnik , a District psychotherapist who just celebrated her own 50th birthday . " There really are no road maps or guidelines . " <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cousin , Susan Raskin , began organizing discussion groups and seminars for midlife women last year , they were surprised to find clients in their thirties and sixties signing up to learn about everything from financial-planning to hormone replacement therapy . <p> " Everybody has their own private midlife , and for most the onset is a crisis , " Potashnik says . Hers arrived on her 40th birthday , when her husband of 17 years announced that he was in love with someone else . She emerged from her own emotional tailspin by confronting midlife as an opportunity to be seized rather than an event to be endured . <p> With her 50th birthday approaching next month , Zaffina also finds herself searching instead of settling . " In the last year and a half , I 've come into a sense of myself and a sense of my worth , " she says . Zaffina always assumed that she would marry , own a home and raise a family , but none of that has happened so far . She feels neither bitter nor complacent . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " my mother got married at 66 and is blissfully happy . " <p> Twenty years ago , while traveling in Italy , " I bought the sweetest little pair of baby booties  --  white with a little pink rose . They were for me and my baby . " Not long ago , she gave them away . <p> " I realized I was n't going to have children , " she says . " I did n't want them to stay in the bag in the back of the closet . " <p> Zaffina dotes on her niece and nephew and the children of friends , whose crayon drawings are fondly framed and hung on her office wall , next to a whimsical clock that ticks backward . <p> She casts herself frequently in the caretaker role , going overboard to tend elderly neighbors or friends in crisis . But life , she feels , " is a bucket brigade . It 's not tit for tat . " <p> At almost-50 , she finds herself wondering : Who will take care of me ? She talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 60s that they are , they decide that the solution is to buy a big house together . A retirement commune . <p> For now , though , Zaffina has other dreams to chase . After ensuring that she could bring along her cat , Lucy , she has joined the Peace Corps  --  something she started to do right after college but never finished filling out the application . She plans to leave her administrative job next year , uncertain where she 'll go or when she 'll be back . <p> Jowers turns 49 in January , the same month she will be getting married and leaving the law firm where she has worked for 14 years to start her own public relations business . When her 8-year-old nephew asks her , " Aunt Sandy , are you going to be on ' Oprah ' ? " she has to laugh . " Well , I 'm trying . " <p> Jan O'Kelly is smack in the middle of the life Zaffina assumed she would have and Jowers is amending to have . A Vienna homemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , O'Kelly still has the vivaciousness and waistline that made her a Cherry Blossom princess in 1966 . She fell in love with her Marine escort that day , and they 'll celebrate their 30th anniversary next year . She turns 50 in February . <p> " The only real hang-up I have about it is being the sandwich generation , " she says . " It 's really a struggle . Sometimes it 's overwhelming . " Her father recently died of Alzheimer 's disease , and she worries now about her mother living alone in Falls Church . O'Kelly 's 24-year-old daughter just got a job teaching high school French and is looking for an apartment , so the O'Kelly nest will be empty soon . For the past 15 years , Jan has run a day-care business from her home , and she figures that the kids  --  not to mention getting up at 5 every morning to run three miles  --  keep her young . " I 'm very happy where I am , " she decides . <p> Turning Points <p> Letty Cottin Pogrebin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about turning 50 . The feminist author and founding editor of Ms. magazine has been there , done that and told all in her new book , " Getting Over Getting Older . " <p> " I really have trouble believing anybody who says it 's fine , I do n't care , I do n't notice , " she declares . " The wonder of the sunset years ! Bull ! People do n't really feel that ! <p> " I had the exact same body till I was 49 and suddenly everything started falling down . I woke up in the morning and suddenly my neck was gone . My chin had melted . You have to be completely oblivious not to notice . You 'd have to be not living in your body not to notice . " <p> Ford insists that " I actually feel more beautiful now than I may have felt turning 21 . . . . Do I have a couple of lumps and bumps that used to be tight ? Yes . Do I worry about it ? No . " <p> Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , found herself being hustled at a Smithsonian singles ' night by a man 12 years younger . " It was sad , " she laughs . She is content with the status quo , and never wanted children , but she fears that the solitude she cherishes now will hurt her later . " Maybe I 've become too rigid by being independent , " she muses . " I do n't want to be old and crabby . " <p> Slipping into a funk over turning 50 is not only common , experts say , but often surprisingly enlightening . <p> Karen Gail Lewis , a Silver Spring therapist who leads horseback-riding retreats for midlife women , noticed that depression preceded a " burst of creative energy " for many of her patients . One opened her own bakery ; another wrote a book . Some left empty marriages ; others went back to college . Like Jowers , they find themselves asking , " Exactly what does my track record look like ? " Fifty is not so much the fear of dying as it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock of aging physically by " taking on what I could change . " She went to a therapist and conquered her lifelong fear of blood . Decidedly unathletic her entire life , she took up hiking . <p> " So I can sit here and tell you at 58 that I 'm stronger and healthier than I was not just at 38 and 48 , but at 18 , " she concludes . <p> Pogrebin and other veterans of the midlife moment of truth also stress the importance of planning something special to celebrate the occasion , a rite of passage . <p> " Friends of mine who had traditional parties with black balloons really have felt besmirched , " Pogrebin reports . " It always ends up feeling hollow and a little nasty . " <p> A Hispanic woman borrowed from the traditional coming-out quinceanera bash for 15-year-old girls and made it a cinquentanera  --  for 50 . Another woman made her friends line up and form a tunnel with their legs , which she then slid through as a symbolic " rebirthing canal . " Karen Gail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to take a cruise with girlfriends she has known since elementary school . <p> Jowers still has a year left , but she 's already asked a performance artist to create an African-inspired ritual and ceremony for her , and she will invite 50 friends . " I told everyone to start saving , " Jowers says . " No gag gifts . " <p> Hillary Clinton 's staff held their own ritual for the first lady , inviting 50 friends to gather at the White House 50 days before her birthday . Holding glowing candles , the guests stepped forward in turn to say why they love her . <p> When she turns 50 today , Ford wants no presents , just the company of her friends . When the party 's over , she plans to visit an art show and then come home to pack her bags for Aruba , where she will spend a few days basking in the sun and swimming , strong and sure , through clear waters .
