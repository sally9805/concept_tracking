Physical and sexual child abuse grab all the headlines . But what you may not realize is that neglect can be worse . <p> They Were Brothers Raised in The Same house  --  same parents , same school  --  but very separate hells . The mother adored the older son . She never walked by him without a touch on the head or a stroke down one arm . The father hated the sight of the boy ; he could hardly walk by without taking at least one good punch at the child . The boy had his mother 's fair coloring , but the father thought he saw another man 's face in the boy 's features . In his view , only the younger son was acceptable . Dark hair , olive skin like his ; the boy looked right . The father never laid a hand on the second son . Yet neither , if she could help it , did the mother . She 'd turn away when the little boy spoke , flinch when he touched her . <p> " It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did n't have the hell beaten out of him like the older boy , " says Bruce Perry , chief of psychiatry at Texas Children 's Hospital in Houston . " She just ignored him . Would n't talk to him , tease him , hold him , comfort him . She 'd say , Looks like his father , acts like his father . " <p> Both boys were referred to Perry 's clinic . They were ages 8 and 6 and already in trouble . They first appeared to be a matched set , united in their hostility , aggression , and determination to push others away . But over time , Perry and his colleagues began to see a difference . The older boy would occasionally smile back , meet their eyes . The younger boy just fiat out was n't there . <p> " The 8-year-old had better social skills to start with , and we were eventually able to make him see that the beatings were not his fault . With counseling and with some medication he got better . But the other boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find pleasure in people . We could n't get through . " <p> Up until then , Perry , who is also a research professor in child psychology at the Baylor College of Medicine , had focused on the impact of violence and trauma on a child 's brain , working with children from the most dangerous communities in Chicago and with children of the Branch Davidian cult in Waco , Texas . To study these brothers , watch them struggle , and see that the most damaged child was not the one who 'd been physically beaten came as a surprise . " I thought , ' Whoa , I 've been missing something here ; " Perry says . <p> The Three Great Sins Against Children  --  those that invoke the law , bring down the wrath of the community and the hounds of child protective services agencies  --  have an unwritten hierarchy : Physical abuse and sexual abuse come first , and then , oh yeah , there 's that neglect thing . <p> It 's not that people do n't take neglect seriously . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agency files every year are there because they were unwashed , unfed , untreated for illness , unwanted . Spectacular neglect cases even make headlines . " Remember that horrible case in Wisconsin last year , the little girl in the cage ? " asks Susan Rose , a professor at the School of Social Welfare at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee . The parents , from the small town of Brillion , kept their 7-year-old daughter in a dog cage in their basement . Both are now in jail after their 11-year-old son walked barefoot through the snow to the police and turned them in . <p> But by and large , neglect is back-page news . In fact , the judge who handled the Brillion case handed down relatively light sentences , pointing out that , in his opinion , the child did appear difficult to handle . Rose has been investigating the way workers in child protective services view neglect , and why they seem less concerned about it than about other forms of abuse . " Part of it , " says Rose , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at . It 's more or less like being in a war zone . They see kids who are really severely neglected and , OK , that 's bad , but it does n't look as bad as the battered child they saw just before . " <p> Yet a growing number of researchers , including Perry and Rose , are finding that neglect may in fact be worse in its long-term impact on a child than physical or sexual abuse . In a study published in the journal Developmental Review , Penelope Trickett , a childhood abuse expert at the University of Southern California , compared the developmental consequences of physical abuse , sexual abuse , and neglect . She looked at toddlers and elementary , middle , and high school students , studying learning delays , social problems , and hostile tendencies . Neglected children tended to be withdrawn and anti-social , not only with their parents but with other children . They were n't the angriest or the most aggressive , but even as toddlers , they were exhibiting signs of trouble ahead . Like abused children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By elementary school , they had the lowest grades and test scores , the highest teacher ratings of learning problems , grade repeats , and school absences . More than that , they showed no signs of pulling ahead . <p> Tricker found the same pattern among the middle and high school students . " I was surprised that neglect was so much worse , " she says . " Most of my work has been in physical and sexual abuse , and I just expected the bottom to be there . Perhaps we 've been so focused on psychopathology , we have n't been paying attention . " <p> Indeed , when Perry searched six major journals for articles on the consequences of neglect , a database of 7,000 articles , he found only 30 citations . " Does that make sense to you ? " he asks . Pediatric textbooks , he points out , devote far less space to neglect , which affects hundreds of thousands of children , than to obscure genetic disorders , which may involve just a few thousand children . Ironically , neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 52 percent of all victims ; physical abuse accounts for 24 percent , and sexual abuse another 6 percent . The remainder is a combination of medical abuse , emotional maltreatment , and unidentified factors . <p> The Challenge is Not Simply Recognizing That neglect is harmful but recognizing it at all . No one has to debate the definition of a broken arm or bruised eye . But even professionals wrestle over the many , subtle , and often varied ideas of what constitutes neglect . <p> " One of the issues that 's held us back is the question of how to frame the issue , " Perry says . " When we think of neglect we think of dirty kids who have n't been given enough food . We need to challenge people to think from another perspective . As children develop , they need different kinds of experiences  --  and I mean need  --  at different points in their lives . Neglect , simply , is the absence of those experiences at the time the child needs them . " <p> Without affection , attention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brain wo n't develop properly . A surprisingly small amount of parental indifference can generate surprisingly large problems . <p> " It is neglectful for an upper-middle-class family to take a 3-month-old , at the cost of holding and rocking and cooing , and put him in front of an educational videotape , " Perry says . " That 's neglectful , robbing that child of necessary somatosensory experience . " <p> Perry offers another scenario of neglect : " You smile at your mother . She does n't smile back . You want to be hugged . She pushes you away . You ask her a question . She wo n't look at you . And so you 're taught that smiling gets you nothing , that people do n't want to look at you . " <p> He asks , " Have you ever talked to one of these neglected children ? They do n't know how to respond to you . It 's as if where all that should be , where the brain should have stored that information , they 're hollow . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a slide of the brain of a child whose parents completely shut him out-global neglect , he calls it . The ventricles , natural hollow chambers in the brain , appear as big black patches . They 're meant to be small at this point in development , but in Perry 's slide , they are tripled in size , filled with fluid because the surrounding brain did n't grow to its full potential . <p> He hopes such images will help solve the dilemma , pinpointing when a child is being harmed by his parents ' indifference . Eventually , he says , we might be able to diagnose neglect by examining brain development . <p> That possibility has given new energy to those arguing that neglect must be taken more seriously . <p> Researchers have long known that in social species a lack of parental care and affection creates a host of dysfunctional behaviors . Only recently have neuroscientists begun trying to work out the brain architecture behind such behaviors . Some of this derives from studies of rats , notably by William Greenough , a psychology professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that baby rats raised in a healthy but sterile environment  --  plenty of food and water and clean bedding but no companionship or toys  --  showed up to 25 percent less growth in their synapses ( the connections between the nerve cells in the brain ) compared with those rats that grew up with companions and an ever-changing menu of toys , puzzles , and mazes to figure out . <p> And this is exactly Perry 's point . " The brains of children are use-dependent , " he argues . They grow properly when given what they need . And that 's a lot more than just clean clothes and food on the table . <p> One of the most provocative studies along this line was done recently by Geraldine Dawson , a psychologist at the University of Washington in Seattle , who looked at the children of severely depressed mothers  --  women who provided very little engagement or positive reinforcement to their infants . She found that , at 14 months , many of those babies had reduced brain-wave activity in the left frontal lobe of their brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings such as happiness and curiosity . " When certain brain cells are stimulated , " Dawson explains , " they become more responsive . " By age 3 1/2 , the children in Dawson 's study whose mothers remained chronically depressed had a slew of behavioral problems , including withdrawal , aggression toward others , crying episodes , and disobedience . <p> A third study in Minnesota examined how these children fare over the long term . The Parent-Child Research Project began in 1975 . Byron Egeland , Martha Farrell Erickson , and their colleagues enrolled 267 women who were in their last trimester of pregnancy . Their now-twentysomething children are still being tracked . Out of the group , the team of psychologists identified 24 mothers as being neglectful , 19 of whom stood out as emotionally remote , or what researchers call " psychologically unavailable . " These women did n't like to cuddle , play with , or talk to their children . <p> And it was their children who stood out dramatically from the others . As part of the project , the psychologists spent hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children in the study , never saying who was neglected , abused , nurtured . Consistently , the children singled out as having learning problems  --  those the teachers considered inattentive , uninvolved , overly passive , anxious , or impatient-were the neglected children . <p> And there was something else . They were also the most unpopular children  --  and not only with their fellow students . The teachers did n't like them either . " They 'd say , I 'm always glad when he 's not in class , " Erickson recalls . " And they were talking about these emotionally neglected children . And so it starts looking like a cycle . " <p> Erickson explains why the problem is so severe . " Other kinds of abuse are episodic , " she says . " In between the bad episodes , the children usually get some attention and even some nurturing . But , from what I 've observed in families , emotional neglect is chronic . And if children are emotionally neglected in the first two years  --  when the family is the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking consequences . It 's hard to see because these children will eventually just act as if they are fine , as if they do n't need anyone when , really , they 've shut down . " <p> The effects of neglect , it turns out , are cumulative . As Erickson points out , it 's not the occasional TV babysit or late-night workday that has impact . It 's when it happens every day . " Neglect just slowly and persistently eats away at the child 's spirit until she has little will to connect with others or explore the world . " <p> According To Maureen Black , A Professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland in Baltimore , the greatest risk factor for severe neglect is poverty . But obviously , it 's not the only one . Poor families get reported more often , not just because they lack resources but because they tend to be more visible to public service agencies . Other risk factors for children-parents who abuse drugs or alcohol , parents who are depressed , parents in bad relationships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found at any income level . <p> Yet neglect , she admits , is still a difficult issue for agencies to handle . It is , after all , an act of omission , making it near invisible . Without the obvious evidence that physical or sexual abuse provides , many people hesitate to intervene . One 1983 study found that hospitals failed to report more than half the cases of obvious neglect to child welfare authorities . " Bizarre as it is , " Black says , " children are better served if something momentarily bad happens because they will get intervention . If a child gets a broken leg , some sort of injury , that child is going to get attention . The emotional problems , the lack of adequate care , the lack of supervision  --  it 's very difficult to make a case . " <p> When it comes to issues such as " psychological unavailability , " says the Minnesota project 's Egeland , child protective services criteria have failed to catch up with the current research . " We do n't define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians do n't have the foresight to do that , " he says . <p> Egeland is inclined to turn sarcastic over the gap between the researchers ' findings and the country 's social service policies . Imagine , he says , calling child protective services to alert investigators to an unsupervised toddler . Or imagine this call , beginning : " I 've found a child who 's watching TV for 16 hours a day , and I 'm concerned that he 's being emotionally neglected . " Even with all the work by researchers showing such neglect matters , he says , he suspects the agency 's response will be simple : " They 'll hang up on you . " <p> Adds Egeland , " Maltreatment is a huge risk factor for many kinds of pathologies  --  depression , suicide , conduct disorders , learning disorders  --  and it just blows me away sometimes that we do n't talk about it in terms of prevention . " <p> Perry has prevention on his mind as well . He 's been tracking the troubled family , the two brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy continues to make gains , but not the younger one . <p> " The younger brother , " says Perry , " is very distant , has no friends , is generally compliant but will have episodes of predatory and violent behaviors . " Usually , he directs this anger toward younger children or animals , says Perry , and shows very little remorse afterwards . Perry notes that the boy has other problems , too . " He steals little things in school , he does n't laugh very much  --  it 's a pretty sad picture . " <p> By Deborah Blum <p>
