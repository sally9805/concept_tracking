<p> The convoluted and contradictory ties between China and Taiwan are reflected in the odd , conflicting stories of the Yuan family of Taipei . <p> Tzu-tung Yuan spent last Saturday morning waiting in a government office to file papers to divorce a Chinese bride he purchased last year in Henan Province for $ 20,000 in cash , gold and jewelry . His younger brother joined him at the office to serve notice that he plans to marry a woman he met in China last year . Two older brothers arrived later to take the pair out for lunch . One boasted that he owns a factory just across the Taiwan Strait in China 's Fujian Province . The other has his money in America and would not dream of investing in Communist China , he said . <p> Like the Yuan family , this island of 21 million people ca n't really make up its mind about mainland China . <p> One day it appears as if tiny , democratizing Taiwan and massive , authoritarian China are uniting after 48 years of being ruled by longtime enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in culture , dress , economics , politics and even language leave the pair as far apart as two countries can be . <p> The death last Wednesday of China 's senior Communist leader , Deng Xiaoping , brings their stormy relationship to a critical new juncture . Will the death of the man who opened China 's economy but stifled political reform push the two sides closer together  --  and thus decrease tension along one of the world 's most important shipping lanes and volatile strategic zones  --  or pull them apart  --  bringing a new Cold War to the South China Sea ? <p> The clock is ticking for Taiwan , which Beijing 's Communist rulers have considered a renegade Chinese province since their Nationalist foes fled here in 1949 . After July 1 , when British-ruled Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control , Taiwan 's stubborn refusal to surrender to Communist rule could become the most explosive issue in this region . <p> The clock is ticking , too , for the United States , which broke relations with Taiwan in 1979 in favor of Beijing but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daoyu , China 's ambassador to Washington , put the United States on notice last week , declaring that Beijing views the U.S. attitude on Taiwan as the " most important and sensitive " point of U.S.-Chinese relations . <p> The future of Taiwan 's ties to mainland China depends largely on two men who have never met : Taiwanese President Lee Tung-hui and his Chinese counterpart , Jiang Zemin , Deng 's handpicked successor . <p> Analysts here predict that China will make no bold initiatives regarding Taiwan in the next year because Jiang will need to ensure first that he is firmly in control before and after the crucial Communist Party Congress scheduled for later this year . <p> " We 're bracing for another year of political deadlock , " said Su Chi , the chief Taiwanese government spokesman . " Let 's face it , Jiang Zemin is entering an election year . " <p> After that , they say , two possibilities are likely . <p> If Jiang 's position is weak , Taiwan could easily become wrapped up in the struggle for power that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be tempted to play the " nationalist card " and increase pressure on Taiwan by conducting threatening military exercises along the Strait of Taiwan to bolster his support within the army , China 's key power broker . <p> China has still not ruled out the use of force to reunite with Taiwan , especially if Taiwan pursues independence . And in a China that will face many complex problems  --  such as peasant unrest , massive unemployment , environmental disasters , lawlessness , ethnic unrest and increasing decentralization  --  focusing attention on an issue that Chinese view in simple terms might provide Jiang with a magnet to hold onto power , a flag to rally around . <p> However , if Jiang grows more powerful , he might adopt a more benevolent attitude toward Taiwan . In January 1995 , Jiang delivered a conciliatory policy speech on relations with Taiwan , stressing that the " one country , two systems " approach that Deng applied to Hong Kong could also apply to Taiwan , guaranteeing greater autonomy and preserving the lifestyle of the self-governing island . He also held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing and Taipei . Such a program could be a model for future cooperation . <p> But all that would depend not only on Jiang , but on his counterpart across the Taiwan Strait , Lee . <p> Since taking control of Taiwan 's ruling Nationalist Party in the late 1980s , Lee has steered the party away from its long-stated desire to " take back " mainland China and toward a recognition of Taiwan 's de facto independence . <p> Lee has launched a series of bold diplomatic initiatives to increase Taiwan 's profile around the world , using controversial methods , such as donating large sums of money and lobbying to get his case heard . Taiwan spent more than $ 4.5 million in fees to a public relations firm and a donation to Cornell University in its successful effort to get Lee a visa for a visit to Cornell in 1995 . It made him the first Taiwanese president since 1979 to make a U.S. trip . <p> Those efforts infuriated the Chinese , who massed troops on the shores of Fujian Province and conducted two sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest landed just 25 miles away . On June 16 , 1995 , six days after Lee returned from the United States , China postponed talks with Taiwan . They have not resumed . <p> Despite pressure from U.S. officials , Lee , too , refuses talks with China , citing his belief that China 's leadership is too weak to make important decisions right now . " Many American congressmen and also President Bush have come to Taiwan to ask me why we do n't talk with the mainland , " Lee said Saturday . " But the point is , with whom should I talk and about what ? Nobody is reliable over there right now . " <p> Ultimately , Western analysts say , Lee must decide whether he wants to attempt to lead this island into independence and risk war or build a common future with Beijing . So far , all indications are that Lee will continue to tweak his Communist adversaries . <p> In March , Tibet 's exiled leader , the Dalai Lama , is scheduled to visit Taiwan in a trip that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolate the Tibetan leader , who seeks greater autonomy for the estimated 4 million Tibetans under Chinese rule . On Sunday , Taiwan 's leading newspaper , the United Daily News , said the Dalai Lama , who fled a Chinese crackdown on Tibet in 1959 , might have an audience with Lee . <p> Despite minimal ties between the two governments , however , the economies and even the societies of China and Taiwan are becoming increasingly intertwined . Taiwanese investors have been at the forefront of China 's economic boom , which Deng kicked off in 1978 . Defying official bans on direct investment in China , Taiwanese companies have poured $ 30 billion into China over the last 17 years . Taiwanese money has been invested in 30,000 factories . Trade between the two sides hit $ 27 billion last year . <p> Since the 1980s , when Taipei and Beijing began allowing travel , more than 9 million people from Taiwan , many of them old soldiers who fought against the Communists , have journeyed to the mainland . In return , 150,000 Chinese have visited Taiwan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples have registered 29,465 marriages  --  mostly of Taiwanese men to Chinese women . Because of limits on emigration from China , the waiting list for spouses to get into Taiwan is about 10 years long . But couples make do with three-month visas , and there is no shortage of people aching to leave poorer China for richer Taiwan . <p> " If China 's light poles could move here , they would , " said Lee Ching-ping , deputy secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation , a quasi-governmental body set up to manage Taiwanese-Chinese ties .
