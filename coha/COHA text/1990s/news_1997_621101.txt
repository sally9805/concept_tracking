<p> UNDERWORLD <p> By Don DeLillo <p> Scribner ; 827 pages ; $ 27.50 <p> For his 11th novel , Don DeLillo , whom some consider the nation 's greatest living novelist , has written an 800-page story about a baseball . <p> Charting the ownership of the ball during the second half of the 20th century , DeLillo offers a millennial hypothesis : that a civilization is defined and destroyed , not ( as prevailing theory has it ) by what it creates but by what it throws away  --  from household trash and atomic waste to human values and lives . <p> It 's hard to imagine anyone but DeLillo pulling off a conceit like this without hitting a meltdown of presumption and pomposity . But DeLillo more than makes it work : " Underworld " is his best novel and perhaps that most elusive of creatures , a great American novel . <p> Despite his enormous critical successes ( " The Names , " " Ratner 's Star , " " Great Jones Street " ) and at least one best-seller ( " Libra " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular breakthrough . Like a character actor who absorbs the identity of each role , DeLillo disappears in his writing by creating a credible voice in each book , whether writing about rock stars , football , Lee Harvey Oswald or the Rev. Moon . <p> The sheer bulk of " Underworld " may seem forbidding , but the introduction is deceptively simple : A kid named Cotter Martin skips school on Oct. 3 , 1951 , to attend the final playoff game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants . Also attending the game are Jackie Gleason , Frank Sinatra , J. Edgar Hoover and restaurateur Toots Shor . The score is tied until the last minute , when Bobby Thomson knocks a homer into the stands off a Ralph Branca pitch , and the Giants take the pennant . After a free-for-all scramble for the game-winning ball , Cotter winds up with the prize . <p> Meanwhile , Hoover has been privately informed that the Soviets have set off an A-bomb test that very day . As the game ends , he 's fretting over the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him from the stadium seats above . One of the pages depicts Pieter Bruegel 's painting " The Triumph of Death , " presaging DeLillo 's apocalyptic theme through the rest of the book . <p> Later , a secondary character observes that " when they make an atomic bomb , listen to this , they make the radioactive core the exact same size as a baseball . " Like everything else in " Underworld , " this is n't a throwaway line : Part of the book 's task is to relate this single baseball ( symbol of our national pastime and valuable collectible ) to what really counts in our society at the end of the millennium : what we have discarded in the form of mothballed nuclear armaments and still-volatile nuclear waste . <p> Flash forward 40 years or so , and we learn the ball is now owned by Nick Shay , an executive in a waste disposal company . How he got the ball becomes the nominal structure for a sometimes dizzying latticework of interrelated characters , time elements and metaphors . Nick 's comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> Nick and his brother , Matt , grew up in New York and took their mother 's last name after their father , a small-time numbers runner named Jimmy Costanza , " went out to get a pack of cigarettes and never came back . " Neighborhood mythology has it that Jimmy was the victim of a mob hit : " they took him out near Orchard Beach , where the shoreline is crannied with remote inlets , and they dropped him into the lower world , his body suspended above the rockweed , in the soft organic murk . " <p> Later in life , as a " waste analyst "  --  in DeLillo 's multilayered context anything from historian to archaeologist to novelist  --  Nick " watched men in moon suits bury drums of nuclear waste and I thought of the living rocks down there , the subterrane process , the half-life , the atoms that decay to half the original number . " <p> " Underworld , " of course , is a novel about burying things , or trying to ; about a surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static " underworld " of what it discards . But like memory , nuclear waste is not static , DeLillo seems to say  --  and like history , the past is never permanently buried , because time itself is a continuum beyond human comprehension . " ( We ) do n't depend on time finally , " one character says later on . " There is a balance , a kind of standoff between the time continuum and the human entity . . . . We eventually succumb to time , it 's true , but time depends on us . We carry it in our muscles and genes , pass it on to the next set of time-factoring creatures . . . " <p> As complex as all of these interrelationships are , DeLillo , like a veteran balloon man , keeps tight hold of the thick bundle of strings by personalizing them through Nick and the other characters . " We built pyramids of waste above and below the earth . The more hazardous the waste , the deeper we tried to sink it . The word plutonium comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underworld , " Nick says , and then adds without pausing : " They took him out to the marshes and wasted him as we say today , or used to say until it got changed to something else . " <p> So the buried figure of Nick 's father becomes the ruler of Nick 's personal underworld of memory . While Nick 's profession may consist of burying things safely , his drive in life is to come to terms with his missing father , to dig him up , as it were . <p> Two other significant events mark Nick 's youth : a sexual affair with an older woman , Klara Sax , and his accidentally murdering a junkie waiter ( the connotation of " junkie " with trash is no coincidence ) and subsequent sentence at a Jesuit-run reform school . <p> DeLillo is smart enough to avoid stating the obvious , that after losing his real father , Nick is sent to a school run by multiple " fathers . " One of the priests asks him to describe a shoe . " A front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me want to weep , " the priest says , proceeding to name all the parts of a shoe including the flap under the lace , the tongue . " I knew the name , " Nick says . " I just did n't see the thing . " <p> " You did n't see the thing because you do n't know how to look , " says the priest . Because " everyday things lie hidden , " he adds ; " everyday things represent the most overlooked knowledge . " These are " quotidian " things  --  " an extraordinary word that suggests the depth and reach of the commonplace . " This may be DeLillo 's way of explaining how to read " Underworld , " but he 's also telling us how to live . <p> As an adult , Nick goes into the desert to look up Klara , who is overseeing a project of making art from the decaying exoskeletons of decommissioned bombers , relics of the now-ended Cold War : " I 've thought hard about the weapons they carried and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " Klara says . " But the bombs were not released . You see . The missiles remained in the underwing carriages , unfired . The men came back and the targets were not destroyed . " <p> It 's a typically thoughtful observation in " Underworld , " but deconstruct it and you 'll get a taste of DeLillo 's neo-baroque construction . Take the recurring word " target , " for example : " My father smoked Lucky Strikes , " Nick says a few pages later . " The pack has a design that could easily be called a target but then maybe not . . . . But I call it a target anyway and f  --  the definitions . " <p> Whether the real " target "  --  Nick 's father  --  was spared does not ultimately matter , because , as a key to Nick 's past , he lives on . In a similar way , while the Cold War may be over , and the world enters the next millennium having avoided nuclear annihilation , civilization in the second half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has discarded : mothballed weaponry and buried nuclear waste representing a past that will never die . <p> Later , Nick goes to the former Soviet Union to observe nuclear waste disposal methods and talks to his Russian counterpart : " I tell Viktor there is a curious connection between weapons and waste . I do n't know exactly what . . . . He says maybe one is the mystical twin of the other . . . . He says waste is the devil twin . Because waste is the secret history , the underhistory , the way archaeologists dig out the history of early cultures , every sort of bone heap and broken tool , literally from under the ground . All those decades , he says , when we thought about weapons all the time and never thought about the dark multiplaying byproduct . ' And in this case , ' I say . ' In our case , in our age . What we excrete comes back to consume us . ' " <p> So the real history of a civilization is not what will survive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangible sense  --  nuclear waste  --  and the intangible values it is perhaps too willing to compromise . For the world superpowers that means a mad willingness to approach the frontier of total annihilation in a foolhardy quest for power . <p> The baseball from the 1951 game ? DeLillo does n't lose track of it for a second . It pops up here and there as we learn how it got from Cotter Martin to Nick , who tellingly explains his fascination with owning the ball : " I did n't buy the object for the glory and drama attached to it , " he says . " It 's not about Thomson hitting the homer . It 's about Branca making the pitch . It 's all about losing . . . ( about ) the mystery of loss . " <p> Not surprisingly , given the Dickensian structure of " Underworld , " one of the ball 's previous owners is a bomber pilot during the Vietnam War named Chuckie Wainwright ; his plane ends up as part of Klara 's art project . He 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and a spiritual hand-me-down . " <p> But now , the ball is " more or less lost , " Chuckie says . Of course , the ball has to be lost or thrown away for Nick to own it , and someday he , too , will give it up so it can be owned by someone else . <p> When the century was new , T.S . Eliot in " The Waste Land " and F. Scott Fitzgerald in " The Great Gatsby " heralded its dawn with a warning about cultural and moral decay . In saying Kaddish for the end of the century , DeLillo acknowledges the truth of those early warnings but offers an ironic suggestion of hope as well : As long as time is not finite and the past is never over , humankind is given a renewable chance for a future . <p> By creating a singular portrait of the inner nature of our time with hundreds of " distracted events , " " Underworld " is nothing short of a bible for the new millennium . Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping across the threshold of the new one , a masterpiece in which the depth and reach of the commonplace are invested with universal scope and grandeur . <p> " Underworld " is also a thrilling page-turner , propelling us along with realistic characters and those compelling details that make it impossible for them  --  or us  --  to escape the past . <p> Don DeLillo speaks at 8 p.m. on Thursday , October 16 , as part of the City Arts and Lectures Friends of the S.F. Public Library series . For tickets , call ( 415 ) 392-4400.
