A former governor of Colorado argues that the challenge of the years ahead is to meet new public needs with ever more limited resources . // America will not remain a Fps us and co petitive country unless we futurize our institutions . One constant in the decline of nations is inability to effectively reform the tions an systems that are causing the ded his historian Arnold Toynbee to observe , " All great nations commit suicide . " Joseph Schumpeter , Nobel Prize-winning economist , observed that all human institutions eventually become smug , self-satisfied , incestuous , bureaucratic , inefficient , and risk-adverse . Time and past success cause them to lose the cutting-edge vitality that made them great institutions in the first place . Jonathan Rauch , journalist and author , calls this process " demosclerosis . " I would suggest that one of the great challenges of the future is to reform our institutions so they are equal to the magnitude of our present-day problems . Great societies have a capacity for self-correction that , clearly , this country has had in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this self-correction continues-to futurize our institutions to become efficient , effective , and competitive for the new world into which we are rapidly moving . We are no longer a continental economy , but compete economically in a world marketplace where we are surrounded by awesomely efficient low-wage competitors . The future belongs , in an economic sense , to the efficient . Domestic Institutions America 's basic domestic institutions have lost much of the Ya and efficiency that helped build our economy and our nation The produce world-class results . No nation spends more money on health care than America . How are we doing ? American males are fifteenth in world life expectancy ; American females are eighth . We are twentieth in infant mortality . And 26 nations have better cardiovascular health rates than we do . Twelve nations have better cancer survival rates . In no major health statistic , except one , are Americans as healthy as people in Europe , England , Canada , or Japan . We have the highest life expectancy after reaching age 80 , mainly because of Medicare , which spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't cover the entire population . We spend more money turning 80year-olds into 90-year-olds than we do 6-year-olds into educated 16-yearolds . We have the least comprehensive , most inefficient , and highly technical health-care system in the world . Yet , it produces comparatively poor health outcomes . Only one nation spends more money on educating its children than does the United States . How are we doing ? American students are in the bottom third on all international comparisons in every subject . Asian students are ahead of American students from the first grade and graduate from high school with as much class time as our students have when they graduate from college-consistently outscoring us by large margins . No nation spends more money on crime control , police , burglar alarms , bars on windows , and private security police . How are we doing ? We live in the most violent and crimeinfested society in the industrial world . No nation spends more money electing politicians to office , or lobbying them while they are there . How are we doing ? Wherever we look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a playground of special interests and self-seeking politicians . The public is rapidly losing the confidence necessary to support a democracy . Less than 20% of the American public " expect government to do the right thing . " Again , we spend more to achieve less . America has 6% of the world 's population but over 50% of the world 's lawyers . American goods and services are burdened by having to carry incredible costs that the goods and services of other nations do n't have to carry . There is a " lawyer tax " on almost everything we do . The political influence of lawyers keeps us from passing the type of tort reform enjoyed by other nations . Ultimately , it is not a company that competes , but societies that compete . Nations that educate their citizens efficiently and effectively , find ways to motivate their workers , deliver health care in a cost-efficient manner , and find expeditious ways to settle disputes among their citizens with a minimum of litigation are generally the nations that win the race for an internationally high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutions ? Every society in the developed world runs its system on a fraction of the lawyers we have . We have two and a half times as many lawyers per capita as Great Britain , five times as many per capita as Germany , and 25 times as many as Japan . Despite this overabundance , we are adding new lawyers at a rate four times faster than our population growth . Photograph Courtroom scenes may be more familiar to Americans than to citizens of any other country . An " overlawyered " society increases the burdens of doing business in America , argues author Richard Lamm. // One scholar has warned : " The legal process , because of its unbridled growth , has become a cancer which threatens the vitality of our form of capitalism and democracy . " We are , beyond question , the most litigious nation on earth and the most litigious in all of human history . This is a form of economic cancer . Our legal system is draining talent from our society-talent that is desperately needed elsewhere . Forty percent of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than wealth-creating scientists , engineers , or technicians . Japan trains 10 engineers for every lawyer ; we train 10 lawyers for every engineer . If we do not know anything else about the new world economy , we should understand that wealth will not flow to the nation with the most litigation and lawyers , but to the nation that has the best wealth-creating team . What are the solutions ? They are not difficult to find , but they are difficult to adopt . Other industrial nations have alternative methods of dispute resolution , which adjust differences and disputes between citizens . For instance , they have no-fault automobile-injury compensation systems . They limit awards for pain and suffering ; and they require the losing party to pay legal fees if a suit was not legally justified . Photograph Young student frustrated by homework . The United States spends more on education than most other industrialized nations , yet students ' performance ranks poorly in many international comparisons . // We are the only nation in the world that has a jury trial in a civil case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Every democratic nation , including our model , Great Britain , has given up the right to a jury trial on most civil lawsuits . Were we to imitate them , we might see substantial reform . Yet , we continue to expend tremendous amounts of effort and money in preserving a procedural nicety which no longer insures a fair and independent account . It is not all the fault of lawyers . Lawyers are partly mirroring the adversarial nature of our culture . Americans are less willing to accept certain losses as non-compensable acts of God . We increasingly believe we have a right to be compensated for every loss . Additionally , we have come to view the legal system like the lottery-as our outside chance to get rich without working for it . The legal system , like the lottery , promises easy riches to the citizens of the casino society , but the net effect is counterproductive to the longterm future of the nation . Former Harvard President Derek Bok put it succinctly , " Our societal gains from law and lawyering are outweighed by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know many of the solutions , but we fail to act . No nation in history has sued its way to greatness . What Are the Solutions In Health Care ? Health care has so many vested interests that we are finding it difficult to reform a system that consumes $1 out of every $7 we spend in America . So what are the solutions to our rising health-care costs ? Again , many solutions are not hard to identify , but they are hard to adopt . America must make either the market or government work to reduce the dollars going into illness care before it eats us alive . We should reform our tort system , which forces so much defensive medicine . We should stop training so many doctors and prevent foreign medical graduates from swelling an already overcrowded profession . We should train far more family doctors and far fewer specialists . We should close many hospitals-50% of the hospital beds in Colorado are empty-and turn others into nursing home facilities . We should have many more hospices and fewer intensive care units . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical portion of workmen 's compensation ? Health insurance and duplicate coverage under our auto insurance ? We should have much less heroic medicine and much more basic medicine . We should give pregnant women more prenatal care and the elderly more flu shots , and we should stop keeping terminal people alive on our high-technology machines . We should tax cigarettes and alcohol more heavily We must also adjust our expectations . Some wise person once told me , " Maturity is a recognition of one 's limitation . " Maturity in a modern society must similarly be the recognition that we can not deliver all the health care we have invented to all our citizens . We must find ways to limit that health care that is not cost effective or is only marginally effective . This will be very hard for a society that thinks it has a right to all the health care that is beneficial-even marginally beneficial . Governmental Institutions The dilemma of American political institutions is that we can not do politically what we need to do economically to remain a prosperous and competitive society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends creep up on us . Then overwhelm us . " When I took over as Governor of Colorado in 1975 , we had a national debt approximately equal to one-third of our GDP When I left office in 1987 , our debt was one-half of our GDP . Today we have a debt equal to three quarters of our GDP ( $5 trillion in a $7 trillion economy ) . No nation can continue this trend . No nation can consume more than it produces , spend more than it taxes , and import more than it exports for very long . Correcting this is difficult . The economy of the 1990s can not fund all of the expectations we have built up during the 1960s and 1970s . We feel " entitled " to an increasing list of programs that are unsustainable . Medicare is not in as bad shape as its critics contend-it is worse ! America is getting older fast . Our children are going to have to run a nation of 50 Floridas . In 2011 , when the baby boomers start to retire , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 2012 , the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements warns us that the current revenue structure will only cover entitlements and interest on the federal debt . No Judiciary . No Executive Branch . No national parks . No discretionary programs . Nada ! Photograph Medicare is among the " sacred cow " benefits Americans have come to expect . If these programs are not restructured , the government will be able to afford nothing else , says Lamm. // Then , by 2029 ( when my children are in mid-career ) , the current tax structure applied to the anticipated revenue in 2029 will only pay for four programs : Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security , and federal retirement programs . Nothing else ! Social Security is a fiscal iceberg lying in our future . We have promised more than we can realistically deliver . Pete Peterson , the financier , observes that a typical middle-aged couple who retired in 1981 has received more Social Security and Medicare benefits back than they paid in federal taxes ( plus interest ) all their lives . Our basic institutions , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly becoming unsustainable . We are living too long and having too few children to blindly continue a system that pays more than it collects . We must look anew at solutions we have historically rejected . We have many options . We could " means test " Social Security and stop paying it to wealthy retirees . We could adjust the Cost of Living Allowance ( COLA ) . We could increase the retirement age to 70 . America could increase its savings and keep faith with its children by slowly privatizing Social Security . There are no politically painless solutions to this actuarial nightmarebut there are solutions . Retiring the baby boomers will be one of the great challenges in American history . The federal budget is a bipartisan problem with our future at stake . We have pre-spent $5 trillion of our children 's money . No one can say No to anyone . Six hundred thousand millionaires get a Social Security check every month . We have millionaires subsidized by Medicare while blocks away children go without health care . Every year , $200 billion in entitlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement over $50,000 a year . Public policy should not blindly transfer money from the young to the old . But that 's what we are doing . We must examine , in the name of fiscal sanity , all of the programs we have built up in the past and too easily take for granted . Our military retirement programs allow people to retire while they are still in their forties-all with indexed pensions and health care . Are we wealthy enough to retire people in their early forties and subsidize them for 40 or 50 years for only 20 years of military service ? Two-thirds of the care given in veterans hospitals are for non-serviceconnected disabilities . Do we really need to give veterans taxpayerfunded care for non-service disabilities ? In fact , with approximately 40% of the hospital beds in America empty , do we even need a system of VA hospitals ? Why not integrate the veterans into the empty hospital beds we now maintain elsewhere in the system ? America has built up a large number of well-meaning programs during the halcyon days of our economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Close to 50% of American families get some sort of governmental check each month ; and yet , many of them are far from needy . It will soon become starkly apparent that we have designed our federal programs too generously . We have cast our safety net too widely and yet missed too many truly poor . Correcting this is politically difficult but must be done . Conclusion The nations of the world are metaphorically lined up on the starting line in the race for a high standard of living . One runner has an American flag on his back , another runner has a Japanese flag on his back , another a German flag , another a Korean flag , and so on . The race is about to begin . Just before the race begins , we ask our runner ( the one with the American flag on his back ) to carry along with him half of all the world 's lawyers , the highest drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace , the largest number of functional illiterates , the highest health-care costs , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bankrupt our children . How much can our runner carry ? It is time to futurize America 's institutions . Author Affiliation About the Author Richard D.
