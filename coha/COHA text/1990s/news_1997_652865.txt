<p> EARLIER THIS YEAR , JANE ALEXANDER , THE departing chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts , wearily spoke of recurring Congressional attempts to " drive a stake in the heart of Federal funding for the arts . " She called these exorcistic rites a " nearly debilitating annual Sturm und Drang that threatens to suck the life out of all arts advocates . " <p> It is too soon to say if the annual Sturm and Drang will achieve its threatened goal , but here is a working critic 's confession : if this perpetual drama actually reaches its final wrenching cadences , it will be a relief . Andres Serrano 's urine-soaked crucifix , Robert Mapplethorpe 's penile photographs , Jesse Helms 's outrage and invocations of family values  --  all will become quaint memories . So will endowment reports like the one released on Oct. 15 that accuses the arts of the sin of elitism . <p> Finally , we will be able to pay attention to the real problem  --  something that might be called the " ideology of democracy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all people created equal but so are all ideas and all cultures . Even art  --  an essentially undemocratic achievement by extraordinarily gifted individuals  --  is thrust into a marketplace marked by clamorous demands for democratic distribution . How can a national agency act as a patron in such an atmosphere ? It ca n't . And it should n't . R.I.P . <p> Before the grave is dug , it might be worth reviewing the all-too-familiar N.E.A. debate . The endowment began in 1965 as part of the same Great Society enterprise that declared war on poverty ; that utopian spirit still characterizes its defense . N.E.A. supporters point out that all great nations help finance the arts  --  France spends $32 a person and Germany $27  --  but the annual costs of the endowment have been no more than 38 cents per capita . That small amount , though , has large repercussions . Endowment Money Talks , But Interpretations Differ <p> According to the endowment , each N.E.A. dollar inspires $11 more in matching grants . Since its founding , the number of orchestras has quadrupled ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts exceed those of all sports events combined . The arts also create $37 billion in economic activity and support 1.3 million jobs . Finally , less than 40 of the 110,000 grants ever given by the N.E.A. have been controversial . <p> The organization 's opponents see a very different picture . The controversial grants , with their provocative sexual , political or religious imagery , are viewed as just extreme examples of the N.E.A. helping to pull the fringe closer to the mainstream . Endowment-inspired matching grants are part of the problem , not solution : they further institutionalize the N.E.A. 's attitudes . <p> And if the endowment has helped increase the quantity of art , it is debatable whether the quality has improved . Economic benefits are also beside the point : if the goal is fiscal health , there are more efficient methods . Countries like France and Germany hardly offer a model for American patronage ; they are too different in character and history . The Government should get out of the business of art criticism . <p> Underlying these arguments , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where deals are made and budgets determined , the N.E.A. is debated with little understanding of what art is all about or what the function of a patron is ; among politicians and , indeed , within the endowment , major decisions are being influenced by the ideology of democracy . <p> That ideology begins with one of the great liberal ideas that defined this country : equality is not something attained or purchased or inherited . It is simply possessed , universally , at birth . Failures to realize this ideal have done nothing to weaken its strength : when we stand before the law as citizens , we are supposed to stand equally . <p> But as de Tocqueville realized , such a revolutionary idea could not be applied in the political realm without also resonating in all other aspects of American life . In fact , it has now become the defining aspect of American culture . We are so loath to make distinctions ( except to correct earlier distinctions ) that we now doubt whether any are worthwhile or even possible . We ask democracy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our culture evolves . <p> The problem is that art is incompatible with this ideology . It is engaged in constant acts of discrimination . Moreover , the ability to create it is no more distributed according to democratic principles than is the ability to play basketball like Michael Jordan or chess like Gary Kasparov . There are differences between us at birth that the civil order must ignore but the esthetic order is beholden to . Even the evaluation of art is guided by such undemocratic gauges as cultivated taste and extensive experience . Can Democratic Ideals Be Used to Judge Art ? <p> So there is a tension at the very heart of the N.E.A. : How can a national agency in a democracy make decisions that are , in their very essence , anti-democratic ? <p> This was an issue raised during the initial debates about whether a Federal arts agency should even be established . Initially , many major arts institutions were opposed to a Federal arts program . In 1953 , a survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League , the service organization for American orchestras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal aid . Aside from the leaders of community orchestras , members of the league remained lukewarm on Federal aid even into the 1960 's . Orchestras and the fine arts , many organizations argued , could only be sullied by the interference of politicians who were neither trained nor inclined to make proper decisions . <p> The skepticism did not disappear once the N.E.A. was established . Who , after all , would be given the power to make judgments about grants ? By what right would anybody 's tastes , values and standards prevail over anybody else 's ? The way such elite activities were reconciled with democratic aspirations was to create an institutional hybrid : the main decision-making was seemingly removed from the realm of democratic politics and ceded to professionals . An elite jury of peers would evaluate each application . <p> This created a new style of artistic patronage . The panel system rejected the idea that we are all equal in judging art , but still turned the judging of art into a " democratic " process . A larger bureaucracy was required to administer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to justify the judgments to those holding the purse strings . <p> The panel system also strengthened the ideology of democracy within the N.E.A. The composition of panels became politically important . Panels were treated as if they should be representative bodies , their members speaking for different constituencies . <p> While politics has always been a handmaiden to patronage  --  older models of arts support by court and church involved notorious quantities of infighting and favoritism  --  the emphasis on accountability created a new kind of bureaucratic politics . Artistic patronage was thrust into the public marketplace , to be buffeted about by conflicting claims . Forget individual taste ; the demand was for representation . <p> During the last two decades this demand has become even more fervent as democratic ideology has taken root in the art world itself . The very idea of artistic quality has become open to question . Many artists have become preoccupied with making ideological statements . And advocates of multiculturalism have questioned the priority of Western standards and styles . <p> In such a landscape , what sort of patron of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a principle of its patronage . It is preoccupied with the size of audiences . It focuses on insuring equal participation by different interest groups . It retains a notion of " excellence " but makes that idea contingent on the opinions of its constituencies . And nothing can be excluded . The endowment boasts that it " reaches Americans of every race , class , ethnicity and geographic region " and " supports community festivals , rural chamber music , art exhibitions in libraries and town halls , lawn concerts . " <p> The N.E.A. has tended to treat financial support of the arts as if the money had to be distributed according to various formulas of representation  --  calculating , to a tenth of a percentage point , funds distributed to each state and ethnic group . Its judging panels in recent years have been created using something resembling an ethnic quota : about a third have consistently been " minorities "  --  American Indians , Asians , blacks or Hispanics  --  and about 48 percent have been women . <p> The result is that the N.E.A. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency was criticized recently for a grant to the California Indian Basket Weavers Association , Ms. Alexander defended " this world-renowned form of traditional art mastered by Native Americans . " No other distinctions were necessary . <p> As a consequence , there appears to be no central vision , simply the clamor of political forces . This is evident in the recent revisions of grant categories , established not according to discipline , like theater or music , but according to principles , like Access , Heritage or Preservation . Such categories give more emphasis to the political benefits of support than to the arts themselves . If the N.E.A. Is Not Elitist , Why Is It Needed ? <p> So without a homogeneous culture , without an education system that creates a deep understanding of artistic traditions , without a realization that art is more than entertainment , public patronage becomes a market phenomenon , responding to conflicting demands , competing bids , promises of influence . We have a democratic society ; we demand democratic arts . <p> It is astonishing how thoroughly this idea has been accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the very essence of traditional patronage of the arts or artistic accomplishment . Newt Gingrich and the Republicans thought they were making an incisive criticism of the N.E.A. when they called it " elitist . " The agency 's allies responded with outrage at the supposed insult . On Oct. 15 , the endowment went a step further in its report , " American Canvas , an Arts Legacy for Our Communities , " blaming arts institutions for being elitist . Each group thought the word a slur rather than a matter of pride . But if the N.E.A. is not elitist , what do we need it for ? <p> Attempts by Republicans to create a test of artistic " decency " also ended up revealing an esthetic vacuum . The arts were treated as if their function was to communicate proper " values " to the public . Washington liberals took a similarly vulgar view , focusing on their own versions of " values " and treating art as a form of social therapy doled out to interest groups . As much as the right 's opposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor . <p> Even the courts have got into the act . When the endowment 's " decency " test for determining the financing of artworks was struck down earlier this year , the court argued that the Government could not deny a work support because of ideas or point of view . This was hailed as a triumph for free speech . But if a patron can not decide whether or not to financially support a work because of its ideas or point of view , on what grounds can it decide ? Form ? Style ? <p> So the ideology of democracy leaves us with a vision of the arts that is pure pork barrel . At this moment , there are few Congressional Democrats or Republicans with any deep understanding of cultural life apart from television or movies . There is nothing to temper the ideology of democracy , only opinion to support it . And this , of course , affects the kind of " art " being created . One criterion for the authenticity of democratic art is that it stir " controversy " : controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifies its cost . Immediate sensation becomes important . So do practical benefits and notions of " relevance . " <p> Paradoxically , though , the ideology of democracy may suggest a means for developing a national artistic culture . It is not to be found in democracy itself but in the intellectual , religious and esthetic traditions that led to its development . If those traditions were really at the center of the N.E.A. , there might be some chance for national patronage ; they might encourage a more healthy artistic diversity , free from democratic demands . There Is a Model For an Arts Paradise <p> Prime examples of institutions that have offered such alternatives are the great museums  --  like the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Here many esthetic universes coexist , with each culture 's most elite and extraordinary objects on display . But they are housed in an enterprise unmistakably based on Western traditions of knowledge and judgment . The museum is made possible by combining Western-style scholarship with multicultural expertise . The Met could evolve in that fashion because it did n't have to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared common goals . <p> A contemporary public patron like the N.E.A. could have similar ideals , but that would mean declaring independence from democratic ideology and being ready to withstand the righteous outrage that would follow . It may be that at this moment of cultural and political fragmentation , a public patron could best serve the public by educating it in art 's undemocratic character , focusing on the cultivation of educated eyes and ears . This would turn the patron into a conservator rather than a supporter of new works  --  a role with risks and restrictions , but with far fewer than democratic dilettantism . The more effective grants of the current N.E.A. could then be built upon . <p> Optimism , though , may be uncalled for . The sad aspect of modern American culture is that we created a National Endowment for the Arts we deserve . The even sadder aspect is that the way things stand now , what we really deserve is no N.E.A. at all .
