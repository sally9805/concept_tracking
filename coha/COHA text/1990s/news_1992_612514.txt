<p> While Paul Westhead , Frank Hamblen and Cotton Fitzsimmons are the latest to tumble from the cruel and unusual NBA head coaching ranks , the Indiana Pacers ' Bob Hill says he benefited immensely from management 's refusal to panic during the club 's 15-28 start . <p> Without any major moves , the Pacers recovered , claimed the seventh spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs and are embroiled in an opening- round rematch with the Boston Celtics . <p> Hill cited the All-Star Game - and the absence of any Pacers - as the most significant development of the season . " I think a lot of the guys thought they had a chance at making the team , and that 's not all bad , " he said . " But they forgot the team game . You know what happens . No one made the extra pass . They took shortcuts on defense . But once that goal gave way , we became a better team . We grew up . " <p> During their trials , said Hill , he received unwavering support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walsh urged the Pacers ' critics to fault him for putting the team together . <p> Not that Hill would have been totally surprised had he been replaced . " We 're all fired , " he said . " But once you 've been fired , you realize all you can do is your best . You do n't take it so hard . " <p> Hill , who played his college ball ( Bowling Green ) under New Jersey coach Bill Fitch , thus has some strong feelings about the way Nets management has failed to publicly support the embattled coach in his feuds with Derrick Coleman and Chris Morris . <p> " I love Bill Fitch , " said Hill . " The bottom line , you 've got a guy who has coached three-four teams , has won a world championship , gotten another team to the Finals , and they do n't want to listen to him ? He 's disciplined and businesslike , and that 's what a professional is supposed to be in this league , I thought . Just do your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Asked how he would react if a player refused to enter a game ( e.g. Coleman and Morris ) , Hill laughed . " I 'm younger . I 'd get in his face , and we 'd have a fight . I 'd get my tail kicked , but I 'd get my punches in . " <p> NO DUCKING DIVAC : Portland 's much-maligned Kevin Duckworth is not enamored of Los Angeles Lakers center Vlade Divac . <p> " He 's a good shooter , and he can rebound , " said Duckworth . " But he 's not that physical a player . He 's a wimp at times because of his flopping . How can a man who considers himself a center play like a wimp ? Who started that flopping stuff anyway ? I see Buck Williams do that sometimes , and I get mad . They act like somebody threw you across the floor . As long I live , I 'm not going to do that . You would never see me stoop down and flop . " <p> Good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L.A. <p> A CHANGED MAN : A calmer , matured George Karl ( his own terms ) says he also has undergone a metamorphosis regarding style of play . Formerly an advocate of Eastern Conference " thug ball , " the Seattle coach now prefers the more refined uptempo style played in the West . <p> " Bodies flying and wrestling matches hurt the game , " he says . " Now I just want to play basketball . I do n't want it to get crazy . " <p> So determined is Karl to avoid altercations during the Golden State- Seattle series that he broke bread with Don Nelson last Saturday at an Italian restaurant , then joined Nelson in the hot tub at his townhouse in Alameda . There , they drank beer and agreed to a " non-aggression " pact . <p> AROUND THE EAST : Add Michael Jordan to Kevin Loughery 's growing list of fans . Says Jordan , a rookie under Loughery : " A lot of labels were put on him , that he did n't work hard and was really too relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's true . He 's a players ' coach . Players relate well to him . He gives them confidence . So I 'm not surprised he was so successful with this team right off the bat . " . . . The Pacers ' Reggie Miller is confident his sister Cheryl , a former Olympian and current ABC sportscaster , has recovered sufficiently from reconstructive knee surgery and will have little trouble making the ' 92 squad . " I watched the women 's NCAA tournament , and from what I saw , she 's still among the best players , " he said . " I did n't see too many players as good as Cheryl , the McGee twins Pam and Paula , Cynthia Cooper , Teresa Edwards . . . where 'd they all go ? " . . . The Celtics ' Dee Brown has lost 10 pounds during his bout with vertigo and a sinus infection that has kept him sidelined the last few weeks . The second-year guard missed the first 45 games after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is unhappy about being omitted from the Pacers ' playoff roster . He plans to meet with Walsh after the season to discuss an assistant coaching position there or elsewhere . . . . Robert Parish credits ex-Celts coach Fitch with " getting me in the best shape of my career , " but rates K.C. Jones and Chris Ford as his " best coaches . " Said the 38-year-old Chief : " K.C. was the best all-around , besides Chris . Chris does a good job in the important areas , communication , coaching , and he has no problem delegating authority to his assistants . He 's also able to put his ego aside . Most as sistant coaches get the title coach and that 's it . " <p> AROUND THE WEST : Mike Dunleavy harbors no illusions about the Lakers ' chances against the Blazers . Despite their victory in the season finale , he admitted , " I felt like we could win last year . This year , coming in , the only way we 're going to win is if we play great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gon na happen . Meanwhile , GM Jerry West , who said he 's " never been more proud of a Laker team , " probably has never been so surprised . While in the Orlando Arena last weekend for the pre- draft camp , he avoided the press room , where several league types convened to watch the Lakers-Blazers finale . When others joined him afterward in the stands , West asked quietly , " Did we win ? " Told the Lakers had life for another day , the GM rolled his eyes , then shook his head . " Mike Dunleavy has done a tremendous job , that 's all I can say , " said West . . . When has this ever happened ? The only two Clippers to play all 82 regular-season games were Ron Harper and Danny Manning , both of whom missed previous seasons rehabilitating from major reconstructive knee surgery . James Donaldson was the last Clipper to play in all 82 games , 1984-85 . . . . Tree Rollins refers to the Rockets as " the most talented team never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline as the main culprit . According to numerous sources , the players were habitually late for practices and games , with Hakeem Olajuwon rarely showing up before 6:45 , a la Charles Barkley . The crucial final regular-season game is said to be a prime example - only four players arrived 90 minutes prior to the 5:30 start , as requested . " If guys were late in Detroit , " said Rollins , " they 'd never get in the locker room . The leaders of the team would straighten out the situation . We just do n't have one a leader . " . . . Olajuwon made no peace offerings after cleaning out his locker and again insisted on a trade . " They have to , " said the All-Star center . " It 's better if we part . I 'm looking forward to the second half of my career . " . . . Lakers assistant Randy Pfund and Del Harris are the leading candidates to replace interim Kings coach Rex Hughes . Why ? Both are friends of the Lakers ' West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas . Kings GM Jerry Reynolds 's status is very much in doubt .
