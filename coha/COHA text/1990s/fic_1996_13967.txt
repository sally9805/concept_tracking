" This " nice " has a bad name to say the goddamn least . Women , to generalize , hate nice no , no , they like it in clerks , they like it in auto mechanics but nice guys finish last , right ? Why ? Because " nice " is essentially thought to lack complexity , mystery . " Nice " just has no sex appeal it just does n't understand the situation . Women distrust " nice " because , given the cultural context , they themselves ca n't possibly be nice . How can the powerless be " nice . " What good is nice to the " exploited " ? So women loathe nice because they see , they know what a phony mask it is in their own lives , so when they perceive it in a man it just pisses them off . What they prefer are abusive qualities moderated by charm , because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not kidding . Hey , I do n't buy it because there is another " nice , " a hard-won , complex , **27;2785;TOOLONG " nice .

JILL ( Calm , not sarcastic . ) Do you mean " bitch " in the sense that I told you something you did n't want to hear ? Or that I 'm " uppity " and do n't do what I 'm told JACK Just shut up , okay ? JILL or remind you of Bette Davis or have assumed the male role JACK I 'm warning you p. 48 JILL Warning me ? JACK Do the books , Jill .

You drive too fast , you love the unknown , you love extremes . I think I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have enough tingle , so you blew it off . p. 49 JILL You do n't think punching me out would be an extreme ? JACK I think punching people out is the final , frustrated expression of the ordinary mind . I think you would like me to hit you so this would be all my fault . It is the only stupid , vulgar , debasing male idiocy you have n't been able to pry out of me , but you uh you 'll never know how do you have any sense how close this close to nailing you yes , there happy now ? JILL I 'm supposed to feel sorry for you because you wanted to hit me ? JACK I was making JILL Well , I do . I am sorry . JACK You are , huh ? JILL Really sorry . JACK Have I ever hit you ?

( Back to Jill . ) I may not have known how to love you but I loved you unendurably , whether or not love exists , and if you had invested in what I felt , we could have shaped it any way that would have worked for both of us , but you were in such a narcissistic fit of self-realization you would n't have known if a perfect union walked up and bit you in the ass . p. 91 JILL Thank you .

JILL Because I do n't know if there is anything called love , Jack , but there is " being known , " which I 've done without and done without , and I see now the time is getting short , and I plain old ca n't afford to do without , and I see now , given the lovers I 'm meeting and the lovers I knew , that you were the one who wanted to know me really , really wanted to know . p. 92 JACK I wanted to know you .
