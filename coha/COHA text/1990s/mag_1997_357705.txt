Michael Foale did n't notice last June when the bluebird began to chirp aboard the Mir space station . Ordinarily , anyone in the station 's core module could not have missed the sudden trilling . But at the moment , Foale was elsewhere . And he had other things on his mind besides a singing bird . <P> The Mir bird was not a real bird , of course . It was a small plastic model that broke into song when its switch was thrown . Lately it had begun singing whenever it was jostled , and on this day it got jostled hard . Just moments before , the station 's commander , Vasili Tsibliyev , had attempted to bring an unmanned cargo vessel in for a remote-control docking . When the ship was just a few yards from the station , it suddenly flew wide of the docking port , sideswiped one of the station 's solar panels and slammed broadside into its Spektr science module . The collision punctured the Spektr 's hull , releasing its atmosphere , and sent the entire station into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew members  --  as well as the future of the Russian space program  --  were in grave doubt . <P> The mishap last summer was the most troubling incident in a troubling year for the geriatric Mir . Already the 11-year-old ship had experienced a breakdown in its oxygen system , a series of leaks in its cooling system and an onboard fire . In the months following the collision , there were power blackouts , repeated failures in the ship 's flickering computer and even an alarming irregularity in Tsibliyev 's heartbeat . <P> But it was the cargo-vessel accident that focused the world 's attention on Mir  --  and on Foale . While Tsibliyev and his fellow Russian Alexander Lazutkin returned to Earth last August  --  having been relieved by two fresh cosmonauts  --  Foale did not get his ride home until a few weeks ago , when the shuttle Atlantis ferried up astronaut David Wolf to relieve him . <P> For the past two weeks , Foale , 40 , has remained all but incommunicado , spending his time either with his family or at NASA debriefings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME for an exclusive interview , his first since returning from his nearly five months aloft . With the help of Foale 's recollections , as well as those of his crewmates , it is now possible to piece together the events surrounding last June 's accident and reconstruct humanity 's most dangerous day in space in more than a decade . <P> TUESDAY , JUNE 24 , EVENING Vasili Tsibliyev had more on his mind than eating his dinner . The Mir workday was over , and except for a few things that had to be powered down or mopped up , the crew had the evening to themselves . This meant they could linger over a Western-style meal of stew or beef at a tiny table in the main module  --  a welcome relief from the traditional Russian fare of warm borsch and jellied perch . <P> Tsibliyev seemed distracted , thinking less about what he was doing tonight than what he would be doing tomorrow . Sometime in the morning , probably just before noon , the commander would lock his remote-control guidance system onto an unmanned Progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station for a docking . For a commander like Tsibliyev , steering a limber little ship like Progress toward a big whale of a target like Mir should not have been cause for worry , and ordinarily he would have been looking forward to the exercise . But tomorrow things would not be so ordinary .
