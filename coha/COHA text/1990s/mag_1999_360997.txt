Chow 's next role is as the King of Siam , opposite Jodie Foster as Anna , in a new version of the story Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musicalized in 1951 and filmed with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner five years later . So who needs another King and I movie ? Kids , apparently . So here is an animated feature that expands and dumbs down the story . There 's some kung fu , a Jafar-style villain with satanic powers , a cartoon menagerie ( funny monkey , majestic leopard , etc. ) , and lame comedy with a crudely drawn , Buddha-shaped fall guy . It 's all needless  --  and harmless . But even with pretty , painterly backgrounds and the eternal lilt of the songs , this film has a limited target audience : six-year-old boys who want to be Michael Crawford . <P>  --  R.C.
