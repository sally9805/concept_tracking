When Joel Klein came up for approval as chief of the Justice Department 's antitrust division last summer , even some Democratic Senators viewed him as a doormat for Big Business and tried to step on his appointment . All that changed last week when Klein audaciously hauled mighty Microsoft into court . Former critics now applaud him as a true trustbuster . The New York Times , which had called Klein 's appointment " disheartening " in July , finds him to be " sensible " and " right " to take on Microsoft . <P> The scholarly but combative Klein , who stands 5 ft. 6 in. in his running shoes , appears to be an unlikely David to Microsoft 's Goliath . He came under heavy fire last April for granting unconditional approval to Bell Atlantic 's $23 billion merger with NYNEX , a deal that created a giant with 39 million phone lines from Maine to Virginia . But Klein , a music buff whose eclectic tastes run from Ray Charles to Puccini , takes no predictable view on enforcement either . He simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not an ideologue or a crusader , " he says . " Our principle is that any consumer should have a choice in what he chooses to buy . But that 's not the case when computer makers must automatically add Microsoft 's Internet browser . " Nor does Klein feel overmatched on high-tech issues . " I 'm online , " he says . " I know what a browser is . " <P> That commonsense approach has guided the Bronx-born Klein through a distinguished , albeit low-keyed , career . A magna cum laude graduate of Harvard law school , Klein clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell Jr . and went on to argue regularly before the high court as a private attorney . He says his biggest victory was a 1992 ruling that lets students who have been victims of sexual harassment collect damages from schools that get federal funding . <P> A friend of Bill Clinton 's , Klein stepped into the void left by the 1993 suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster and helped the First Family navigate Whitewater turmoil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Stephen Breyer through Congress before joining Justice in 1995 as understudy to then antitrust chief Anne Bingaman . <P> Since his arrival , Klein has quietly put up impressive numbers . His team forced agribusiness giant Archer-Daniels-Midland to pay a record $100 million fine for rigging a feed-additive market earlier this year ; three former ADM executives are under indictment . Klein is reportedly preparing a massive antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard , alleging a duopoly over credit-card transactions . <P> Klein began probing Microsoft 's browser-licensing practices partly in response to furious complaints from rival softwaremakers like Netscape . That Silicon Valley company , which is fighting to keep its 60% share of the browser market from being overrun by Microsoft , has so far handed over thousands of pages of documents . As Klein sees it , the ultimate goal in the case is to keep Bill Gates or anyone else from blocking innovation in the markets for software and personal computers . " This is an enormously challenging time in terms of the application of antitrust law to a fast-moving industry , " Klein says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  --  doubt that this Friend of Bill 's from the Bronx is up to the task .  --  By John Greenwald .
