txt some may say arrogant , reassembly of existing periods and motifs , yet somehow it all works , it all blends together in tasteful eclecti-cism . It gives the impression that the original house had been remodeled over the centuries as time , taste , and money permitted , as was the case with so many of the grand houses of Europe . We have now reached an era when we lack the confidence to be able to rebuild portions of an existing grand house in a contemporary style ; even if we had the confidence we would not get the consent . One may feel that there is sufficient eccentricity in building a house that stylistically spans four centuries , but the great joy at Vizcaya as far as we are concerned lies offshore . During construc-tion and the dredging of the hammock , as the native forest out of which Vizcaya grew is called , a number of small islets were formed , and there was some worry that these would be claimed by the state , thus ceasing to be part of the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had visited the Lago Maggiore in the north of Italy , in which lies the fantastic Isola Bella " ; Beautiful Island , " which has been remade in its entirety into the shape of a ship . Suarez took the largest of the Vizcaya islets and devised a great breakwater in the form of a stately ceremonial barge , apparently moored just offshore . The barge was carved out of coral stone by Stirling Calder at a cost of $8,000 , a sum that Deering resented as he felt the carvings would be coarse . It is a tri-umph of garden architecture . Ten years later and two hundred miles away on the east coast of the state rose another Venetian palace , John and Mable Ringling 's Ca'd'Zan in Sarasota . There was more concern here for chronologi-cal authenticity , the Ringlings preferring to choose one particular architectural period and stick to it . As a result , their 1924 palace looks as if it had been built in Venice in 1492 ; whether they decided on such an anagrammatic date as a joke ( they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain sea voyage undertaken that year is not known . Their architect , Dwight J. Baum , had proposed a Geor-gian-style house , but the Ringlings had their hearts set on Venetian Gothic . The House of John ( Ca'd'Zan , in the Venetian dialect ) rose in multicolored magnificence facing due east on the Sarasota shore , its perfect alignment emphasized by a large mosaic compass set in a path in front of the house . Later Baum professionally retreated from such polychromatic splendor and went on to reach fortune and tame from more conventional structures , but the eccentric beauty of Ca'd'Zan remains his best-loved work . A man 's expression of love for his wife can take many forms . Shah Jahan enshrined his grief at losing his wife Mumtaz in the exquisite beauty of the Taj Mahal ; Irwin A.

After her death the castle drifted from owner to owner until it was bought and restored by Jean Louwsma in 1981 . Mrs. Louwsma claims to be an intensely private person , yet she takes journalists on tours of the house , and claims she is living there only to look after it for Josefina . The William Randolph Hearst story is more like the Bill Gates story than Citizen Kane . No rags to riches here ; they were both sons of rich men who made themselves even richer . But Citizen Kane 's Xanadu could only hint at the torrid grandeur of Hearst Castle , San Simeon , La Casa Grande ? so big they named it thrice . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , the Piedra Blanca Ranch , which Hearst 's father bought in 1865 . Hearst started building on the site , by then known as Camp Hill , in 1919 , having employed the prolific San Francisco architect Julia Morgan , an apparently timid , self-effacing woman whose mild exterior concealed a , titanium resolve and ability to fabricate extraordinary effects at reasonable prices . Visitors to Berkeley 's City Club , which Morgan designed as a women 's club in 1929 , are swept away by the cloistered charm of mock medievality , cheaply and effectively achieved with poured concrete , molds , and wooden battens . Morgan was married to her work , putting in up to eighteen hours a day , six days a week . It is doubtful that any architect before or since has approached the quantity of her output ? more than eight hundred major buildings in the forty-six years she ran her office . Nor was this achieved through delegation : she herself dealt directly with all her clients , from Hearsts to taxi drivers . Perhaps her greatest strength was her ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , and concrete . In Hearst she found a dreamer on a colossal scale . It started simply enough . Morgan had worked with Hearst 's mother Phoebe on a chain of YWCAs throughout the western states . After Phoebe died in 1919 , Hearst approached Morgan about building a place on Camp Hill , saying , " I get tired of going up there and camping in tents . I 'm getting a little old for that . " He showed her a hook of bungalow plans he had unearthed . " Keep it simple , " he advised her . How then did one of the most spectacular palaces in America arise from that modest instruction ? Was it Hearst or Morgan who succumbed to megalomania ? Walter Steilberg , an architect in Morgan 's practice , sketched the first plan , but it was quickly obvious that something grander was going to be required . Hearst already had a remarkable collection of art that included paneled rooms , ceilings , and architectural antiques among paintings and sculptures , and on leis mother 's death he inherited far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Morgan quickly comprehended her task . " I 'm not building a residence , I 'm building a museum , " she said to her staff . The guest houses came first , with La Casa Del Mar , overlooking the Pacific , being completed within the first year . It was followed the next year by La Casa del Monte , with a view of the Santa Lucia Mountains , and the following year by La Casa del Sol , with a view of the setting sun . These " cottages " had only eighteen or so rooms , and decoration that was merely sensational rather than mind boggling . The Big House was not ready to move into until 1925 . By now it was apparent that all this was really something , even by the standards of millionaires , and still another name was given to the site : la Cuesta Encantada , " the Enchanted Hill . " The indoor swimming pool , known as the Roman Pool , was covered in mosaics that took three and a half years to place . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pool , probably the most lavish ever constructed . Hearst bought more works of art than he could ever hope to handle . Many of his purchases went directly into storage , never to be unpacked . In the end , La Casa Grande was the world 's most beautiful warehouse . We are fortunate that Hearst and Morgan met when they did . Ten years later the 1929 crash ended , perhaps forever , the ability of an individual to build on this scale . Construction did not stop imme-diately ; it slowly ran down until 1937 . Plans for additional wings stayed rolled up . The Big House was never finished . Out in the invigorating if threatening California desert , a strange structure began to rise in Death Valley in 1924 . Scotty 's Castle is now a well-known tourist destination . But why was it built ? Death Valley Scotty , as Walter Perry Scott liked to be known , was an extrovert , if such a mild word can be used for one who used to throw gold nuggets and one-hundred-dollar bills out of train windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who hired a train to make a record-breaking run from Los Angeles to Chicago , who prospected for gold unsuccessfully for three years and was consequently chased all over the West by his erstwhile partner . Such men make legends even if they do n't always build castles . Scotty did , because he eventually found his gold mine in the shape of one Albert Johnson , a sickly but impressively rich Chicagoan whose health was greatly improved by the clean dry desert air . Johnson built a block house in 1922 on the site , but Scotty hankered after a castle , and Johnson allowed him to have it . Work started in 1927 , with two low buildings separated by a central courtyard and a circular tower with an open string spiral staircase at the end of the back block . A large , handsome clock tower with Westminster chimes and a lovely , multicolored tiled , pyramidal roof stood on a low hill to the west , with the longest , loudest sustain of any bell I 've heard . Maybe it 's the clear desert air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the architect , but his designs ? " beautiful in their indigenous purity , " wrote Johnson ? were rejected as not being sufficiently ornate , and they turned to a Los Angeles designer , C. Alexander MacNeilledge . By the spring of 1931 , it was all nearing completion . The landscaping was still to be done , including terraced grounds and a tea garden , and the 250-foot serpentine swimming pool merely awaited tiling , but the 1929 crash had hit Johnson hard . He ordered all work to stop , and Scotty had no gold mine to make up the shortfall . In the end the construction cost was more than $2 million , or $4 million , or $10 million , depending on Scotty 's mood as he told the story . But despite running out of serious money , both Johnson and Scotty derived huge pleasure from the ranch for many years , until they died in 1948 and 1954 respectively . " He repays me in laughs , " said Johnson about his roguish partner . The sprawling , eclectic Spanish Moorish fantasy , 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Johnson and Scott Death Valley Ranch , but Scotty 's huge personality dominated the entire development and inevitably it has become known as Scotty 's Castle . The tiles for the unfinished serpentine swimming pool still remain stored in the castle 's basement . We talked of palaces and princesses at the start , but although we have had a Belgian prince and the Queen of Romania there have been distressingly few princesses so far . In Phoenix , Arizona , Boyce Luther Gulley started to build the Mystery Castle for a princess in 1927 , on the foothills of the South Mountain . Gulley was a shoe salesman , and the princess was his daughter Mary Lou . Having abandoned his wife and Mary Lou , he took up with an abandoned box car , then improved it into an 18-room , 8,000-square-foot , sham medieval hacienda , never letting his daughter near the site . From the surrounding fence the original boxcar can no longer be made out under the accretions of the years . A tower with no discernible back tilts queasily toward an arch . Adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roof line looks like a temperature chart for downtown Phoenix . Mary Lou saw it for the first time after Gulley died in 1945 , moved in and never left . The castle is open to the public six days a week from October to July and closed on Mondays , the day we visited . " I 've come from Scottsdale to see this , " grumbled a frustrated visitor . Peering through the cyclone fence I thought of home , five thousand miles away , and said nothing . " There was nothing odd about Harry , " mused an old friend of Harry Andrews from Loveland , Ohio , " ' cept he built himself a castle . " Harry started building Chateau Laroche on the banks of the Little Miami River in 1929 , two years after Gulley began . This was a more traditional affair ? stone , brick , and concrete built , four square and castellated ? but each stone and brick was put into place by Andrews alone . He was not working from a romantic dream but from an educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Roman architecture at Colgate University before going on to postgraduate work in Norman architecture in Toulouse , France . He knew what he was doing , he simply preferred to do it himself . Some of the boys from the Sunday school where he taught helped him , but over the next forty years the greater bulk of the work was carried out single-handedly by Andrews . He made the bricks by filling milk cartons with concrete , built a road to the castle , bored a well , used oil cans covered in concrete to make a damp-proof floor , and solved each problem as he came to it in his own way . Harry was keen on medieval pageantry as well as symbolism ; the 88 battlements on the castle stood for the 88 counties of Ohio , and the 50 battlements on the north wing represented the states of the Union . He retired from teaching in 1955 and devoted himself full time to his castle and his boy helpers , the Knights of the Golden Trail . The reward for helping I larry build his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been knighted on the field of battle in the First World War ; history is a little shaky as to how this happened , but the result is that the south of Ohio is awash with knights . Andrews carried on building an underground garage and a retaining wall until he was sadly burned to death in a trash fire in I981 . The Coral Castle at Homestead , Florida , was a ten-acre romantic dream . It was built single-handedly by a jilted Latvian immigrant , Edward Leedskalnin , as a hopeless tribute to his improbably named ex-fiancee Agnes Scuffs , whom he referred to throughout his life as " Sweet Sixteen . " On the eve of their wedding , she jilted him , telling him that at twenty-six he was too old for her . Broken hearted , he fled Latvia and emigrated to Canada . He worked his way down through California and Texas , working variously as a lumberjack and cowboy until he was told he had tuberculosis and was advised to seek a warmer climate . He arrived in Florida just after World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $12.50 , Leedskalnin began to carve the coral rock he found under the thin Florida top soil . He carved a chair , then a table , then an entire castle . Then he decided to move to Homestead , ten miles away , because Florida City was becoming too crowded . He bought ten acres along U.S. Route 1 and instead of starting over , he singlehandedly and secretively trans-ported his castle , bit by bit , by night to Homestead , leaving just one tower behind . Apparently the plan was that he would become so famous by building this massive rock coral castle that Sweet Sixteen would hear about it in Vilnius and come back to him . He died unfulfilled in 1951 , but his romantic dream endures . A father and daughter from New York , visiting on Thanksgiving 1993 , were so entranced by the castle that they failed to hear the closing bells . The police and the manager , still picking turkey out of his teeth , arrived to release them , and the father shuffled out : " This is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " What puzzles visitors is how a small , slight man like Leedskalnin ( five feet tall , one hundred pounds ) managed to shift and balance these massive rocks , some weighing up to thirty tons . One slab , the Nine Ton Gate , was so per fectly balanced that it swung open or shut at the touch of a finger ; was , because it now requires a very hefty shove to move it . Hurri cane Andrew , in August 1992 , left the Coral Castle virtually untouched , while devastation laid waste all around . It is a remark-able , tormented accomplishment . Jim Bishop bears a startling resemblance to Gene Wilder in High Anxiety , but that 's about as far as the similarity goes . Bishop is as solid as the castle he is building in Pueblo , Colorado . He is his own master and his own architect , and his dreams are unfettered by for nnal architectural precedents . Bishop 's Castle rewrites the book on defensive medieval architecture . It is a fantastical structure , all arched buttresses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box cars , a 100-foot tower with a bartizan side turret all built out of massive , rubbly , undressed river rock on a two-acre site . The bartizan turret has a gleaming gold acorn roof , a Colorado Kremlin . On the top of the steeply raked high gable is a dragon 's head , mouth agape , designed to spew flames . Bishop started work on the castle in 1969 , part time at first but now full time , while his two sons run his metal fabrication shop . The castle has a gift shop , a kitchen , and a living room with a 20-foot ceiling , a museum on the second floor also with a 20-foot ceiling to display the medieval weapons and suits of armor he has collected or created , and the third floor is the ballroom , with a mighty 40-foot ceiling and an organ salvaged from a local church . Why is he doing it ? " I 've dreamed of building a castle since I was a kid . I got hooked on the idea . It tugged at me until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bishop enjoys dressing as a knight in homemade armor and posing with his battle-ax in front of his castle . It seems a shame he chose to locate his castle in Colorado in preference to Maryland , where the official state sport is jousting . Knight , bishop , castle ? the link has already been made by Howard Solomon . Buried in the backwoods between Arcadia and Ona in central Florida is a glittering silver castle with towers , portcullis , castellations , and a moat complete with full-size wooden galleon . It is the creation of a sculptor , New York State ? born Solomon , who claims his family have been unemployed castle builders for four centuries . He decided to do something about it . Solomon is a serious artist who is unable to take himself seriously . He has been recycling unlikely materials into sculptures and buildings since way before recycling became the norm . His life-size sculpture of a horse , made out of wire coat hangers , is displayed in Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum in Saint Augustine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indeed the moonlight , when it takes on a breathtaking fairytale aspect ? is that the basic wooden structure is clad with aluminum litho printing plates that he bought as scrap from the local newspaper for ten cents a sheet . " Now that they 've found out what I 'm doing with them they 're charging me thirty-five cents a plate ? oy ! " You can never be sure when Solomon is joking . He owns a lot of the land around , and his castle sits in one corner acre of a 64-acre lot . On the adjacent acres he is planning to build a gigantic knight , then a bishop .. . A castle that is not a castle lifts its battlements above the windtorn trees on Saint Augustine 's North Beach in Florida . A sign on the gate reads " Castle Otttis . An Original Sculpture Done in Remembrance of Jesus Christ . " Well , this is not a sculpture , it is a building , and one that looks a lot like a castle at that . It was built by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started work on it in 1984 from plans " created in dreams and imaginations . " Ickes , a reggae musician from Bermuda , wanted to express his devotion in some concrete form , and he conceived and designed the castle as an art project . Sadler was an illiterate tobacco field worker from North Carolina , and Ickes told him that if he put his heart and soul into the project , Ickes would name it after him . Scratching Ottis ' name in the dirt , Ickes mistakenly spelled it with three ts . He looked at what he had written with wonder , seeing the 0 as the symbol of eternity , the i as the omnipresence of God , and the three ts as the three crosses on Calvary . In 1988 Ickes felt a " harmonic convergence , a sense of completeness . " To him , the crenellations that topped the towers symbolized Jesus ' crown of thorns . There were eighty-eight window openings , unglazed , unplanned , the same number as Harry Andrews 's Ohio castle , the same as the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that to be significant . The interior of the castle remained unfinished . There were no utilities and no provision for them . ( Ink the exterior had ever been visualized . As the castle was intended to be a sculpture , no thought had been given to an interior , but Father Robert Baker , the local parish priest , saw the possibilities and persuaded the men to complete it in the style of a tenth-century Irish church . The woodwork was done by a Ten-nessean appropriately named Lee Carpenter . This is serious stuff , but Ickes retains an awareness of the bizarre nature of his enterprise . " After work we 'd sit under a bay tree and reflect on what we 'd done that day , and we would burst out laughing at the enormity of it all . " And he was n't troubled by his lack of a building permit . One day shortly after the towers topped the trees and the structure became visible from the road , a building inspector friend of his came down the drive and said , " Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , another friend provided a permit for a garage , and that was that . Castle Otttis , an original sculpture done in remembrance of Jesus Christ , where more than thirty weddings have been held , including a Jewish ceremony , is officially a garage . These last few dream castles have their air of unreality heightened by the lack of vast teams of laborers toiling unremittingly in the broiling sun to fulfill the insane megalomania of one man . With the arrival of the twentieth century came the realization that the most valuable resources are human life , spirit , imagination , and soul . Machines were invented to do the donkey work . Now ordinary people could build palaces , unconstrained by architects , engineers , surveyors , and dictators . They set to work with a will . They were also unconstrained by cheap labor so they had to do it all themselves , but that was no deterrent . It added to the pleasure . Joe Vallenino , building his house outside Watertown , Connecticut , confessed , " I do n't want nobody working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Their castles , palaces , and dream houses were built with whatever material came to hand ; sure , they would use marble and cut glass and Welsh slate and fine damask if it was lying around , but supplies of empty bottles , driftwood , printing plates , tin cans , scrap , and homemade concrete were more frequently available . Poured concrete was to architecture what desktop publishing was to typography . All of a sudden anybody could do it , and too many people did . Anyway , money is an irrelevance when you build castles . But before we entirely leave this fantasy of palaces and castles , there is a final mysterious edifice to be glimpsed at a distance from the Versailles Road in Lexington , Kentucky . Behind a notice shouting KEEP OUT ! WARRANTS WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST OWNERS AND/OR LICENSE NUMBERS OF TRESPASSING VEHICLES UNDER KRS 433 . NO EXCEPTIONS ! posted on a massive iron gate , in the bluegrass center of horse country , four long low walls join to make a huge castellated square , with octagonal towers capped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands the castle keep , also low , with round turrets at each corner . The story goes that it was built by an adoring husband for his wife , who divorced him when she saw it . The truth is harder to unravel , but there are some known facts . The castle was conceived in Europe , when Caroline Bogaert Martin thought it would be nice to have a wall surrounding her home . Her husband Rex Martin , a real estate developer , purchased fifty-three acres of land along Versailles Road and Pisgah Pike . The plans for the castle were drawn up in 1968 and construction started the following year . The castle was still incomplete when the couple divorced in 1975 . It was intended to have seven bedrooms , fifteen bathrooms , Italian fountains , and tennis courts ; nothing was finished . It stands on a bare slope forlornly glowering at the highway like an aggressive recluse . There is always a police car parked in the driveway , but no cops are seen and speculation is that the police car , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out on the site for years , and prominent For Sale notices are posted on the property . Call the number given , however , and a recorded mes sage asks you to leave a number . You will never be called back . The privacy surrounding such a prominent building is remarkable . This was not something built by someone seeking privacy ; it shouts its existence right across Woodford County . In 1988 it was valued by the local authorities at $554,000 , an incomplete assessment because it was " still under construction . " It is said that the asking price is cur-rently an unrealistic $4 million . The castle bears an uncanny resem-blance to the monastery of Sucevita in the Suceava province of Romania . SCRAP SHACKS Paper , salt , coal , and bottles do not readily spring to mind as ideal building materials . Paper and salt seem particu larly willful choices given their weathering properties ; apart from the sheer difficulty of rendering the materials fit for con-struction , a fine air of unreality hangs over the whole enterprise . Why bother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Elis Sten-man the question nags away incessantly as fact after fact tumbles out about the history of his Paper House in Pigeon Cove , Massachusetts . From 1922 until the outbreak of war , toiling through the Great clear varnish , browning with age , through which it is still possible to read enticing snatches of Boston life in the 1930s : were commented on admiringly .. . by radio experts here .

The house also contains a grandfather clock made from the daily newspapers from each of the capitals of the forty-eight continental states , and one desk constructed from copies of the Christian Science Monitor and another from newspapers reporting Lindbergh 's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927 . The piano , the octagonal tables , chairs , and seats , even the fireplace ( although the chimney , sensibly enough , is brick-built ) , all are made from tightly rolled newspapers that , we are informed , can theoretically still be unrolled and read . We were not allowed to verify this . And as we drive back down into the little coastal village of Pigeon Cove we are still baffled . Why did Elis Stenman feel it necessary to invest twenty years of his life rolling up newspapers ? We are given an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment to see what could be done with newspapers without damaging the print . The experiment has proved a success both in strength and stability . " Merely ? Twenty years of merely experimenting ? Well , now the world is wiser . Thank you , Mr. Stenman . Salt is even sillier than paper as a building material . It dissolves in water almost as quickly as bourbon , so it needs to be sealed very carefully . Then again , perhaps it does n't rain too much in Grand Saline , Texas , where the tiny Salt Palace , the world 's only salt house , can be found . It was built in 1936 , by C. O. Dixon , the manager of the Grand Saline Light and Power Company , to celebrate the Texas Centennial . Disappointingly it was never intended as a permanent home , but rather as a little museum to promote the general saltiness of the area . A new salt house was built to replace the old one , not quite as salty , as only two walls are covered , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uselessness of salt as a construction material . This is , unsurprisingly , unique . Nowhere else in the world did anyone bother to attempt building a house out of salt , although Lot 's wife did have a brief but memorable career as a caryatid . A house built out of coal ? Check with your fire insurance company first , but if they demand a precedent you can point to Williamson , West Virginia , on the Kentucky border , where the chamber of commerce has housed itself comfortably on Second Avenue and Court Street in a single-story building whose walls are made from sixty-five tons of randomly cut bituminous coal , windows and doors arched with coal voussoirs . It was built in 1933 by H. T. Hicks and D. M. Goode , and externally it has maintained its integrity by being regularly coated with weatherproof varnish . You will have realized that Williamson is a coal mining community . Bottle houses appear to be a peculiarly American phenomenon ; most of them seem to have been built out of necessity rather than whim , and the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ est bottle house in the state was William F. Peck 's 1902 house in Tonopah , but it was torn down in the early 1980s . Two small bottle houses still struggle to survive in Goldfield , both on Main Street , the one at the edge of town now almost beyond repair due to the depre dations of bottle hunters , the other , opposite the grimly castellated 1907 courthouse , still with most of its four walls standing . This was built with the bottles set diagonally in alternate courses . One brown rectangular bottle is molded " Patented 1902 " on the bottom , so that allows us to postdate the house . Ellen and Clint live in a five wheel ( otherwise known as a mobile home ) next to Tom Kelly 's bottle house . Ellen and Clint are the only permanent inhabitants of Rhyolite , an entrancing ghost town in the Amargosa Desert . Rhyolite was founded in February 1905 , after Frank " Shorty " Harris and Ernest L.

He started work in September 1905 , and 50,000 bottles later completed the house in February 1906 . Kelly used bottles because , as Ellen drily remarked , " It 's very difficult to build a house with lumber from a Joshua tree . " Rhyolite was the fastest boom and bust town ever ; it went from nothing to a population of more than 10,000 , with banks , churches , two railroads , a grand station , electric power and light , three water and sewage companies , a large concrete school for 250 pupils , hotels , restaurants , and a telephone exchange then back to nothing in an astonishing six years ?

He died at the age of eighty in 1969 , the last inhabitant of the Bottle House . Of this once booming city a few ruins remain : a couple of shacks , the ruins of the Cook Bank , the school , the railroad station in reasonable condition , and the sagging Bottle House . Thompson tried to repair it by putting concrete between the bottles instead of the adobe mud that Kelly had used and , because concrete has a different coefficient of expansion than adobe , the fierce desert heat has begun to crack some of the bottles .

In the 1930s Martin Lowman built himself a one-story house in a forest clearing between Ocala and Hernando , Florida , using onegallon Clorox bleach bottles and a flint infill . Most of the bottles were clear , but he used brown bottles for framing and picking out geometrical patterns . He and his mother lived in this glass house with clear walls until 1979 , when Ed Toi , a Texan trucker , bought the property . Ed has improved and expanded the house , although the roof has gone from the room nearest the road . There was a consistency and integrity about Lowman 's work that Ed has maintained ? Lowman was faithful to the Clorox brand and Ed has seen tit not to change , even getting in touch with the company , based on the West Coast , to try and get old bottles from them for repairs and replacements .

To make matters worse , the highway department wants to convert the country road beside which the shack was originally built to a four-lane highway , obliterating the Bottle House in the process . America has many four-lane highways , but only a very few bottle houses . I heard that there was a house made out of 10,000 milk bottles in Tampa , Florida , but Lowman 's Clorox Bottle House is probably it . Consistency and necessity were not uppermost in the mind of John Hope , pharmacist of Hillsville , Virginia , when he built his bot-tle house in 1940 . Hope was the first man in town to have a swim-ming pool , and Miss Marshall , the Hillsville librarian , was lucky enough to be friendly with his daughter . In return Miss Marshall 's mother , who worked in a restaurant , saved wine bottles and gave t hem to Doc Hope , who constructed a charming , polychromatic lit-tle house out of them , together with his used medicine bottles .

Assuming the house to have been built largely of wine bottles diligently emptied by Doc Hope , the townspeople christened his little folly " The House of a Thousand Headaches . " The most ambitious bottle house in the nation became a bottle village . It was started by an elderly lady ? a rare example of a woman driven by the compulsion to build and go on building , a curiously male preserve . Grandma Prisbrey 's Bottle Village stands on a lot at 4595 Cochran Street , Simi Valley , California , a few miles from Northridge , the epicenter of the January 1994 earthquake . Grandma Penny , as her mailbox still describes her , started her Bot-tle Village in 1955 when she was sixty-two , and while she brought a fresh sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TV screens , car windshields , and fir cones into her fantasies , she had no idea how to allow for earth-quakes . The quake has badly damaged her masterpiece , bringing down several walls and one entire and important building , the Pen-cil House . Several roofs appear to have collapsed , but it is difficult to check as the property has been sealed off with yellow police tape . The Pencil House was important because it was the start of the whole project . Grandma Prisbrey liked to collect things , and when her collection of 4,000 pencils grew too large for the trailer she lived in with her husband , she built the Pencil House out of bottles and other pieces of junk she picked up from the city dump , which she visited every day for more than twenty years . She also built a Lean-ing Tower of Pisa , a rumpus room , a shell house , a doll house , the Little Chapel , a cabana , Cleopatra 's Bedroom , and more , using over a million bottles . The state and fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes that funds will be available for its restoration now that it has been designated a California Historical Monument as well as a Ventura County Cultural Landmark . A nonprofit organization , Preserve Bottle Village , has been set up to repair and restore it . Charlie Yelton began building his bottle houses in Forest City , North Carolina , in 1971 . Charlie had seen a television program about a bottle house out West ( Rhyolite ? Grandma Prisbrey ? ) and reckoned he could do that , too . He had just retired after working for the Florence Mill for fifty years , and needed something to occupy himself . Four years and 11,987 bottles later Charlie had three bottle houses , a glass wishing well , and a glass flower garden all built out of beer and whiskey bottles , as well as 7-Up and Milk of Magnesia bottles . Nor had he any idea of how to build a house . " I just started building and laid it out as I went , " he explained . As with Doc Hope 's bottle house in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secular stained glass effect that gave Charlie peace : " I come here pretty often when I feel I want to be alone with the Lord . I just kneel down here and talk to the Lord for a while . When I leave here I feel a lot better . " Charlie Yelton died in 1993 , and as with Grand-ma Prisbrey , the future of his rare work is undecided . There is another bottle house in Yettem , California , and a newish one built by Knott 's Berry Farm for their sham ghost town in Calico , California . There was a very fine example in Pittman , Nevada , called the House of Lost Memories , or Parker 's Castle . Not only has it been demolished but Pittman itself has disappeared from Clark County on the official state map . There arc also some fine bottle houses in Canada . Bottle houses are uniquely North American architectural manifestations , and more care should be taken to preserve them . Scrap shacks do not have mighty porticos , Palladian windows , or cupolas , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guild , a noted industrial designer whose work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum , had a penchant for making houses happen . He would scout architectural salvage yards , demolition contractors , and junk shops for anything that caught his fancy . He would then reerect the parts with a blithe disregard for form , convention , or classical rules . A reerected barn looked too plain to him , so he added a Georgian doorway with pilasters . Ordinary frame houses acquired architectural accretions until their visual coherence gratefully collapsed under the weight of conflicting motifs . They became scrap palaces rather than scrap shacks , miniature Biltmores and Versailles , and some of them carried names of equal grandeur such as Boscobel and Monticello . Guild was interested only in construction , not maintenance . His houses began the irreversible process of decay the moment building ceased ; he wanted nothing further to do with them . Three of them were torn down within two years of his death in 1985 . A few survive . Guild 's philosophy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 for House and Garden : " The House Just Happened . " As all the best buildings do , of course . In the same state of mind William Dudley built a house at Fishkill , New York , in 1854 . It was described as " an architectural curiosity of the first water , built from pieces of various Greek Revival structures by a demolition contractor . " The doorsill came from the cage of Samson The Bear , a famous New York attraction in the mid-nineteenth century . Interstate highway 80 through northern Nevada , enthusiastically dubbed the " Wagon Master Trail " by the state 's tourism commission , is a worthy contender for the dullest road in America . Dull it most certainly is , all the way through the high desert to Imlay when suddenly one of the most remarkable structures in the West leaps into view . This is Thunder Mountain , not a mountain at all , but a folly house and garden built by Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder , who was not Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder at all . If that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is or was a house , unlike any other house anywhere . Its nearest relative must be the Watts " Ibwers , simply because they share cement and bottles and broken tiles in their construction . It is hard to figure out the shape of the house ; better to say it could once have looked like an enormous shopping basket but now it defies methodical description . Listing some of the materials used in its construction may begin to indicate its eclecticism ? typewriters , concrete , stones , bottles , television screens , cans , ceramic insulators , tiles , car windshields , slate , skulls , cement ? you get the picture . Sometimes there is almost a hint of normality : it is possible to discern on the third story a standard pitched roof , but it is so swamped by the riot of cement statues and swathed by concrete ropes , all daubed in every available color of paint , that the eye simply ignores it as being out of place . There is one large ground floor topped with a concrete tree of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out of metal rods covered with cement . Spears pierce the arch . Around the house are placed farm implements , giant concrete statues ( among them Sitting Bull and Sarah Winnemucca ) , old pick-up trucks , a crane , a forge , a couple of peacocks , and too much else to note . Further description is futile ; only a visit can do this fantastic place justice , together with some background information . It was begun in 1968 , as a " Monument to the First Inhabitants of the West , the American Indians , by Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder , " says the information board at the deserted entrance . And we learn that Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder was born Frank van Zant in Oklahoma on the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the eleventh year of the twentieth century . He had a varied life , much of it rootless and wandering : deputy sheriff , airman in World War II , Methodist minister , logger , police officer , miner , archeology student at Berkeley , private detective . A quarter Cree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to articulate his pas sions , he turned to construction as a means of expression , as we have seen before . Texts , homilies , and straightforward ravings cover the grounds and the walls of the erection , generally taking an antifederal government stance and defending Indian tribes . Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder was interviewed as his work progressed . " My purpose is to add something worthwhile to America . It will never be completed as long as I am alive . When I die , only then will it be done . " He committed suicide on the site on January 8 , 1989 . If an old railroad car sounds like a good home for a hobo , an old Pullman coach should be home to the King of the Road . In Medo-ra , North Dakota , someone expressed himself by covering an entire Pullman with cobblestones for his own mysterious ends . And from a Pullman coach to Pullman , Washington , where Vic Moore , who lectures at Washington State University , lives in his thesis . The Moorage , Moore 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a master 's degree in fine arts , and he described it as " a big asssemblage which has absolutely no practical , utilitarian function like architecture . " Nevertheless it has a crazy cohesion , two turrets with finials mimicking a conventional Victorian bay window , but created from corrugated iron rather than granite . Houston 's apparent lack of zoning laws have allowed for a splendid variety of eccentricities within the city . On Malone Street near Memorial Park a house covered in flattened beer cans can scarcely be seen for the shimmering , clicking curtains of pull tabs and can tops and bottoms that drape the entire structure . The Beer Can House was a plain frame dwelling until John Milkovisch retired and decided to do something with the cans he had n't recycled . Again we meet a busy , practical man with time on his hands . This one liked beer , a lot . The bottle-house builders all denied sampling the product ; Milkovisch happily put away 50,000 cans of the amber nectar before he started to flatten them to provide himself with free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help reduce air conditioning costs , then went on to add arches in the garden , a ladder to the sky , and fences sparkling with marbles until he died in 1988 . Son Ronnie is carrying on the tradition , and he has built a solid beer can fence and gate in front of the house . Nearby on Floyd Street is Tempietto Zeni , an architect-designed house , but one that needed an extremely idiosyncratic client ? in this case the architect himself , Frank Zeni . Three mighty , asymmetrical Ionic columns made out of corrugated steel provide the initial shock of Zeni 's house . He has reinterpreted the classical orders in commonly available material , and the end product , although bizarre to behold , works . Another temple , on Munger Street this time , is dedicated to the orange . As far as Jeff McKissack , the retired postal worker who started the Orange Show , was concerned , oranges were the only fruit . The Orange Show , which took him twenty years to construct after he retired in 1959 , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally a temple . There are tracts on How You Can Live 100 Years And Still Be Spry ( the answer involves oranges ) , mottoes , posters , and exhortations . Architecturally the structure can barely be made out underneath the weight of orangephenalia , flags , masts , wheels , and colored wrought iron . McKissack was seriously impressed by oranges . The Orange Show is now a major cultural center in 1 louston . Joseph Vallenino has had a hard life . He was brought up poor . He bought a little old house on the side of the Nonewaug River on Route 6 in Woodbury , Connecticut , back in 1972 when he was forty , and started to build on it in 1975 . Twelve years later his brother died . Vallenino said it broke him up , so he worked the grief out of his system by engulfing the little old house in a great mansion . A low-pitched roof covers the entire structure , rising to four stories . The house is now L-shaped with tiers of classical columns at the base of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How do I find the time ? I do n't hang out in gin mills , that 's how . Look at these columns . Know how much they cost ? " Joe , working as a demolition contractor , acquired the cast-iron columns at some unbelievably low price from a warehouse he was taking down in Bridgeport . The extension is roofed with the best quality Vermont slate . Gray , green , and purple Vermont slate tiles cost $2.50 a piece , but the red slates are $7.50 each . And red they are ? not another shade of mauve or lilac , but a good strong terra-cotta red . Joe uses them for highlight and emphasis . He never uses scrap in the construction , only high-quality materials that may have been previously used . It does n't diminish the quality . Joe 's mansion is his life . It does n't really matter if he never finishes it ; he 's happy just to work on it and talk about it . Real scrap was used in the construction of a deliberately eccentric residence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central coast . Art Beal was a character ; blessed with a nose like an exploding eggplant , he liked to call himself " Captain Nitwit " or " Der Tinkerpaw , " while his less tolerant neighbors knew him as " The Fool on the Hill . " Beal had the colorful background usually only granted to first novelists , working as a dishwasher and vaudeville comedian , losing his mother ( a Klamath Indian , of course ) in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , becoming a champion swimmer with Johnny Weissmuller , working with Dr. Linus Pauling , even touring with Willie Nelson , but his house is what made him famous . It began in 1928 when he was thirty-two , as a one-room shack on an awkward site ? well , a cliff face ? on Hillcrest Drive . Over the years it grew relentlessly , upward and outward , improved with beer cans , bottles , televisions , hub caps , river rock , abalone shells , paint cans , toilet seats , radios , old tin signs , window frames , salvaged doors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no more in mind of doing this than growing feathers , " he remarked , but there it stands , precariously embracing the hillside in and on nine levels , designated a California Registered Historical Landmark in 1981 , while he was still alive , and rapidly falling into decay and disrepair now that he is dead . Near Pueblo , Colorado , a cluster of scruffy Buckminster Fullerinspired geodesic domes mushroomed in 1965 , acquiring the name Drop City after the dropouts who built them . They were constructed from scrap metal such as car roofs , painted in Detroit 's original selection of colors but otherwise undecorated , the opposite of individuality ( which is not a desirable trait in communal life ) . In the 1970s Mike Nichols in Taos , New Mexico , also chose the scrap route for his dwelling but preferred to call it recycled , which has a more ecologically correct air . He used bottles , tires , aluminum cans , and old lumber in his construction , but the most interesting features were the walls , which were made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered . This makes a great deal of sense ; you end up with 20-inch-thick walls with excellent insulation in winter and summer , at very low cost . They probably bounce around in earthquakes quite well , too . The eeriest house in America is not the Bates mansion from Hitchcock 's Psycho , but a simple , unassuming little house standing in a quiet suburb of Petersburg , Virginia . Near the junction of Youngs Road and Squall Level Road , an area of modest houses with fair-sized yards , stands this one exception , a silent , stone house , empty and neglected . It sits square and sensible on its lot , two stories , three windows at the front , two windows at the side , and a thousand widows within . For this house was not built of ordinary stone . To stand apart from its wooden neighbors , it was built of solid marble , the marble of nearly 2,000 tombstones of Union soldiers killed in the siege of Petersburg . The town is not particularly proud of its gruesome domicile ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of its existence . The curator of the Petersburg Museum explained that what appears to have happened is that , to save on maintenance , all the tombstones were removed from Poplar Grove cemetery and sold to a Mr. O. E. Young , the builder of this house . No one in the town particularly wanted to spend money maintaining Union graves , so the sale reduced costs considerably . Some people may have thought this was justice , as 60,000 people were killed in the siege of Petersburg , which lasted for ten months until April 1865 . The only visitors the house now gets are people looking for the gravestones of their ancestors . The tombstones face inward , so as the owner lay in bed the names of the dead stood about his head ; later they were plastered over so that their descendants leave none the wiser . Because of the mild dereliction of the house ? it is slowly being restored by a gentleman from North Carolina ? one of the markers has become visible : carved in relief out of a Union shield is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last word must he left to the lady living next door to the Tombstone I-louse , who confessed with massive political incorrectness , " Ah do n't rightly see what all the fuss was about . They was jist Union boys . MIRACLE HOUSES ( THE AMERICAN DREAM ) Great idealists stand serene and certain among their uncomfortable contemporaries who will , in the main , resort to mockery . It was ever so ; the object of ridicule smiles quietly and murmurs , " Time will prove me right . " When no limits are set , this can never be denied . Hexagons , octagons , decagons , dodecahedrons , circles ? Ameri-can builders of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries embraced the concept of living in the round more enthusiastically than had their European or Asiatic forebears . Sub-Saharan huts and Native Amer-ican teepees seem to have had a greater influence on the individual-istic home builder than any number of castellations or drawbridges . In Europe round buildings were largely ceremonial : the Pantheon in Rome , the church of San Vitale in Ravenna , the Choragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be jocular : the Colonne Detruite at the Desert de Retz in France . In Britain , the monopteros , the rotunda temple , became a favorite garden orna-ment , while whitewashed round houses in Veryan , Cornwall , were said to have been built to confuse the devil . Two ladies built a six-teen-sided house called A La Ronde in Devon in 1798 , unique in Britain , but America pulled effortlessly ahead with many good examples of the genre . A magnilicent sixteen-sided barn in Hayfield , Virginia , dating from 1886 , was burned down in 1967 . Buckminster Fuller 's geodesdome was enthusiastically embraced by alternative thinkers , a fatal accolade resulting in an ill-lit and gloomy 128-sided globe perched on a service shaft in the drab Arizona desert outside Yucca ; a dispirited golf ball on a tee in an infinite bunker . Even the mail box , a half-hearted replica of its parent , fails to raise a smile . The essential flaw is that the original design can not be expanded , and the necessary accumulations of everyday life like the discarded refrigerator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base with no real home to go to . In 1960 Clay Lancaster published an enjoyably idiosyncratic book entitled The Architectural Follies of America , which I had hoped to plagiarize extensively until I discovered that much of what he described had been torn down years before he described it . However , Lancaster kindled my enthusiasm for a favorite style of his : the octagon house . Initially unconvinced , I became an unquestioning believer after seeing the Armour-Stiner House iii Irvington-on-Hudson , New York , and reading Orson Squire Fowler 's seminal work A Home For All . Fowler was a successful phrenologist and publisher , but above all he was a promoter and popularizer . He spent the first part of his working life as a phrenologist , a now-discredited science that has been replaced by psychology , and , like modern psychologists , much of his work was concerned with sex , health , and the family . He attributed much of the world 's misery , unhappiness , and ill health to inadequate living conditions , and resolved to revolutionize them . Convenience was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by perpetually irritating mothers , sours the tempers of their children , even before birth , thus rendering the whole family bad-dispositioned by nature . " This led him , by a leap of deduction not easy to comprehend , to recommend the octagon as the ideal format for a residence . There is not space here to recount the myriad ways that Fowler convinced himself and many others of the superiority of the octagon over any ordinary building , but his persuasiveness can be gauged from the fact that more than 1,000 octagonal houses were built in America in the twenty years following the publication of A Home For All . There are some octagonal houses elsewhere in the world , but nothing like America 's treasure trove . Fowler 's passion was for concrete . The original 1848 title of his book was A Home For All or a New , Cheap , Convenient , and Superior Mode of Building . The 1853 edition was retitled A Home For All or The Gravel Wall and Octagon Mode of Building New , Cheap , Convenient , Superior and Adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , concrete . Fowler 's mentor in this area was Joseph Goodrich of Milton , Wisconsin . Fowler had visited him in 1850 and had been hugely impressed by the concrete buildings Goodrich had erected , as well as by his showmanship ? he gave Fowler a sledgehammer and told him to hit the inside of his parlor wall " as hard as I pleased " for six cents per blow , which he said would repair all damages . Fowler was distressed by the reaction of the locals to Goodrich 's first experiments in concrete . " He first built an academy not larger than a school-house . Part way up , a severe storm washed it , so that a portion fell . His neighbors wrote on it with chalk by night , Goodrich 's folly . ' But after it was up , he wrote in answer , Goodrich 's wisdom .. " ' Fowler practiced what he preached . Between Fishkill and Wappinger 's Falls in New York State he began to build , in 1847 , a mammoth three-story octagon house , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ue to lack of funds it took nearly ten years to construct ; despite the financial and critical success of A Home For All and the author 's claims for the cheapness of his methods , a 65-room house will always be expensive to build . He had already warned his readers not to " endanger bankruptcy , or spend beyond your means " but for Fowler the cost was incidental , as he wrote : " No labor of my life has given me more lively delight than the planning and building of my house . " The truth of this is apparent in the subsequent history of the house . One obvious flaw in the octagon design is that it can not be extended without compromising its integrity ; when the house is finished it is finished , and there is an end to it . It can only be extended vertically . The house was finally completed in 1857 , and almost immediately Fowler leased it to a William A. Riker for five years . The only reasonable explanation for Fowler 's action , apart from a cash-flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and found something else to do . Time after time this behavior is seen in folly builders . They either work on their buildings forever , completing them only in death , or they actually finish the project , in which case they lose interest and move away . Chief Rolling Mountain Thunder is an example of the first type ; Simon Rodia and Orson Squire Fowler the second . Unfortunately , Fowler 's theories , like his gravel walls , were not impermeable . Riker used the huge structure as a boarding house , and the following summer a typhoid epidemic broke out in it . Sewage had seeped through Fowler 's " impermeable " coarse concrete walls , decimating the lodgers . A new tenant , Professor Cassard , ran a military school for young Spaniards in the house but decamped without paying the rent . Fowler 's Folly was then rented by a Mrs. Berdell as a guest house , but the inhabitants of Fishkill decided that the poor woman was a notorious mass murderess of the same name . This did not encourage potential guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been apprehended , the business had collapsed . The house limped on with a succession of tenants , progressively shabbier . Repairs were made in 1880 but Fowler died in 1887 , and the house fell into ruin . In August , 1897 , the structure was dynamited " because of the danger to visitors who still come to see Fowler 's Folly . " The local newspaper , the Fishkill Standard , reported at the time that " it used to be bought or sold on the New York Stock Exchange when the members had no more exciting occupation . " Despite this catalog of failures , a magnificent vindication of Fowler 's theories survives in splendid condition at Irvington-onHudson , a few miles from Fishkill . Built by Philip Armour in 1860 , it was adored by a subsequent owner , Philip Stiller , who enlarged it by adding a huge multicolored dome in purple , blue , and red slate , and further decked out the house with an encircling veranda , a cupola , wildly elaborate bargeboards , and all the appurtenances that befit a gentleman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrested carousel , " it remains one of the most unusual and distinctive private houses in America . Over the past fif teen years it has been sensitively and carefully restored to its full polychromatic plum pudding glory by an architect and artist , Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Pelli . After the Armour-Stiner House the most astonishing octagon house in the nation is Nutt 's Folly , or Longwood , south of Natchez , Mississippi . It is a vast mansion , the octagon form being disguised by the addition of rectangular rooms on every other facet . The whole gigantic edifice is topped with an onion dome . Samuel Sloan promoted this exotic Oriental design in his two-volume work , The Model Architect , published in Philadelphia in 1852 . Dr. Haller Nutt , recently returned from successfully smuggling cotton seeds out of Egypt , saw the book and found his dream home . He commissioned Sloan to design the house and construction started in 1861 , rather unfortunately for Dr. Nutt , who was a Union sympathizer . It is said that he flew the American flag over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate troops burned his cotton fields . Distressed , he hauled up the Confederate flag just as the Union troops arrived , so they in turn burned his ginmill , sawmill , and three further plantations . Nutt gave up and left . Longwood has more justification for the title of folly than the Armour-Stiner house , as construction was then halted before the house was finished , and it has remained uncompleted since then . Despite these rumors and legends , members of the Nutt family held onto the house , living in the basement until the 1960s . Now it is a museum owned by the Pilgrimage Garden Club ; the internal scaffolding is still erect and the workmen 's tools are still on site , waiting for Dr. Nutt to return and complete the job , just as they have been for more than a century . Several octagon homes still stand , along with a very few that predate Fowler 's epiphany . Lack of time has prevented a pilgrimage to the sites of all the known survivors , but this totally American passion needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in octagonally badged MGs , now almost as rare . While there is nothing in America to compare with the Chevalier de Monville 's hugely eccentric concentric house outside Paris in the form of a ruined column , mentioned earlier ? which so caught the imagination of Thomas Jefferson that both the Capitol and Monticello show traces of Monville 's influence ? there are some examples of earlier octagons and circles . Monticello , the house many Americans regard as their ideal home , is octagonal , as is Jefferson 's 792-acre retreat at Poplar Forest in Lynchburg , Virginia , which has a small octagonal house that burned down in the mid-nineteenth century and has since been rebuilt . At the time of visiting , in 1993 , it was again under repair , with the foundations being underpinned . It is symmetrically flanked by two brick-built octagonal outhouses , tactfully described by Jefferson 's mason : " I have finished one Neces sary , " he wrote in 1811 , " I shall finish the other next week . " Fowler never refers to Jefferson 's unusual passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Col. John Tayloe III commissioned Dr. William Thornton , the primary architect of the Capitol , to design for him a family house in Washington , D.C. , known as The Octagon , which was completed in 1802 . Although the structure still stands , surrounded by the head-quarters for the American Institute of Architects , it seems to have inspired but one imitator , a house on the corner of Sixteenth and U Streets , N.W. This may be due to the fact that no part of The Octa-gon is remotely octagonal . It was built on a 70-degree-angled corner lot , an inevitable concomitant of a radial city centrally planned , and Thornton 's solution was pragmatic and elegant : two main reception rooms angled to the shape of the lot , abutting a circular hall with a further circular stairwell , and an oval room and service rooms link-ing the two main wings . Not an octagon in sight . It is built of a love-ly salmon-pink brick with fine white mortaring , but there is little of the folly about it aside from the cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ( before fitting out ) came in a year later at $35,000 . Washington defense contractors must have learned , i lot front this early example . Not until 1829 do we find a surviving circular home , but this one was described to me as truly bizarre : a figure eight rather than an octagon , and apparently nicknamed the Jew 's Harp House for its passing resemblance in plan to that melodic instrument . The reality is less fanciful . Seth Strong 's spectacular attempt at family housing in Northampton , Massachusetts , caused all the rumors to fly but in fact there is no figure eight , no octagon , and no Jew 's Harp to be seen ? it is simply a large round brick-built house with a conical roof . At the rear is the one-story rectangular ell which may have given rise to the house 's old nomenclature , now only half remembered . It is the earliest surviving round house in New England , but again it had few imitators . Fifteen years later , in Middletown , Rhode Island , two shipbuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished architect Charles Follen McKim , of McKim , Mead and White , designed a surviving shingled round house in the 1890s for Daniel S. Newhall in Jamestown , Rhode Island , on Conanicut , a hideaway now bridged to the outside world . " No gorgeous palaces uprear / Their walls of pomp and folly here , " wrote Henry S. Frieze about Conanicut in 1844 . In Texarkana , Texas , James H. Draughn extended the octagon theory by building three of them together , then adding a porch at the bottom . Voila : the Ace of Clubs . Draughn , of Welsh ancestry , was born in Tennessee in 1843 , the son of an innkeeper . He worked in California , Nevada , Kentucky , Ohio , and Tennessee before arriving in Texarkana in 1873 , where he worked in dry goods and lumber . Here he began to make serious money , and he founded the First National Bank of Texarkana . Such an elevated position required a house of similar eminence , and in 1883 he constructed this late flowering of the octagon style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadly , the unknown architect 's ingeniously designed floor plan gave rise to stories that Draughn had financed the building of the house by winning a fortune at cards , not the most illustrious pedigree for a would-be respected banker . Perhaps this was the reason that lay behind his decision within three years to sell his house to W. L. Whitaker and move to Sulphur Station . The house later belonged to the Moore family who lived in it for ninety-one years until it was bequeathed to the Texarkana Historical Society in 1985 . Orson Squire Fowler 's inspiration came not from common observation but from genuine originality of thought . Before Fowler , houses in this format were are . After the publication of his book , they proliferated . Throughout this book we have seen examples of mild eccentrici-ty , megalomania , pride , passion , and futility , all best expressed in architecture . Each of these edifices has a little touch of individuality that allows us to grace them with the title of folly . But nothing can ever deserve that title quite so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a folly to define follies . The Winchester Mys-tery House , a mansion now surrounded by suburbia , is the finest folly house in America , and nowhere in its extensive documentation or its gift shop the size of Macy 's is there a mention of the word folly . Sarah Winchester 's fortune came , together with her guilt , from the Winchester Rifle Company . In 1884 , she lost her only child , and shortly afterwards , her husband ( who left her $20 million ) , and she became convinced that her bad luck came from the spirits of the thousands who had been killed by Winchester repeaters , particular-ly the Indians . She escaped from chilly Connecticut to the warm , fer-tile farmlands of San Jose and bought a modest farmhouse called Llanda Villa . Few people are as gullible as the very rich , and Sarah Winchester had been told that in order to placate the spirits of the dead , she would have to build incessantly . She did . From 1884 until the day she died in September , 1922 , construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 days a week , 365 days a year . She was not too overcome by remorse to refuse the $1,000-a-day royalties that the guns brought her . Her grief and fear were introspective , as seen throughout this three-dimensional maze . The house is turned in upon itself , with stairs leading to ceilings , windows opening into other rooms , doors with blank walls behind them , and steps going down to go up . The owners , who have turned the house into a major tourist attraction , play up the mystery by leading tour parties on a tortuous trail a mile long through the house , constantly changing levels and aspects , now up , now down , now out , now in , warning tourists not to stray from the party for fear of getting lost . Near the middle of the house is the so-called Seance Room , a plain room like every other , with one entrance and three exits . We are told that Mrs. Winchester used this room not just for seances but for keeping an eye on her servants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well above the kitchen . It is easy to conjure her up as a malevolent presence beating heavily in the heart of the house but there is no malevolence here , only fear and anxiety and insecurity , an elaborate series of defenses against an imagined foe . Perhaps the most surprising thing about all these follies is the lack of a real ghost story attached to any of them . The buildings must have enough character without the need for the spiritual dimension . Sarah Winchester hammered and sawed her way to tranquillity , but it was a prophylactic measure , no record existing of a haunting at the house apart from a short catalog ( which mysteriously ends in 1982 ) of the " eerie " experiences of Winchester Mystery House guides , impartially compiled by the press office . Not even the Tombstone House in Petersburg , Virginia , has inspired a good haunt , but another Petersburg resident was as wary of the unknown as Mrs. Winchester . This was Charles O'Hara , who built his Trapezium House on North Market Street in 1815 , following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him that as evil spirits loved right-angled corners they should be avoided at all costs . O'Hara built his house accordingly . Face on , it is an elegant three-story Georgian brick town house , a valuable piece of real estate if it did n't confront a junkyard for distressed Jaguars . Move a little way to either side , however , and the construction ceases to make any sense . Each side wall angles back at about 60 degrees , so you can look at a flat facade from virtually anywhere in front of the house . The house was not O'Hara 's only oddity . He was a staunch Irish monarchist , and paraded through the city in full British Army regalia every Saint Patrick 's Day . Do not condemn him ; at that time Ireland was part of the United Kingdom . Every decade throws up its House of the Future , and every decade we carry on living in the same old houses and apartments that we have lived in for centuries . Apart from modern insulation and the provision of utilities , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected by the Pilgrim fathers . Some past houses of the future survive , however , still valiantly struggling against the tides of fashion , exotic archaisms in a bland , homogenized world . Be it to pioneer the use of a new material , to demonstrate a theory , to prove an alternative method of construction , or to reduce costs , much of mankind 's wilder creativity and ingenuity has been put into attempts to improve his living quarters . Not all of it has been equally effective . I am still working , without any lively hope of success , on a machine that tidies up after me . Domestic improvements have come gradually , not in sudden spurts ; your average everyday house of the future holds too many new ideas to be assimilated with ease . But dream homes usually have one or two novelties that nuke it into ronunon life . In Beverly Shores , Indiana , a twelve-sided , glass-walled house started life in 1933 , billed as the " House of Tomorrow " in the Century of Progress International Exhibition in Chicago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distantly inspired by none other than Orson Squire Fowler . Before building the House of Tomorrow he made a detailed study of the Richards House in Watertown , Wisconsin , one of the largest octagon houses built . " I have the first dishwasher ever made , " now boasts the owner of the House of Tomorrow . Of course it does n't work , but who cares ? This demonstrates the interdependency of progress . Industrial dishwashers had first appeared in the mid-nineteenth century , but the invention of Calgon in 1932 allowed the House of the Future to incorporate a domestic dishwasher only a year later . From such improvements our life is made ; plumbing , electricity , central heating , air conditioning , all interconnected , one step at a time . The Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art commissioned an aluminum house as a high-tech experiment in the 1930s . It has been put up and taken down several times in its life , and is currently living on the campus at the New York Institute of Technology . But how many of us now live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant steps for mankind attempted by our dream builders are necessary to keep us moving forward ; it does n't matter that they sometimes fall short or trip over their enthusiasms . Thomas Edison took a break from his phonographs and light bulbs to devise a means of pouring concrete into house-sized molds . This allowed for the factory prefabrication of houses , dramatically reducing costs and , with remarkable prescience , saving trees . The best known surviving example was built in 1912 in Upper Montclair , New Jersey , near Edison 's own home . It is surprisingly elegant for a house built out of concrete , complete with classical pilasters and parapet . One associates prefabricated concrete molds with low-rent housing , but this was evidently carefully and thoughtfully designed . " It has never leaked , " says the owner proudly . Why did n't the idea catch on ? Because house-sized molds are not the most wieldy constructions , and although the method reduced costs on the basis of long production runs , the start-up cost proved prohibitive . Pouring a fine concrete silt in situ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soleri 's vast concept in central Arizona . Arcosanti is intended to be a near self-sufficient community of about 5,000 people , a city independent yet part of its environment . Work has been going on for twenty-five years , carried out by discipies of Soleri who pay for the privilege to work there . The project ? which we are assured is finite ? is about 3 percent complete . This means that at the present rate of progress the work should be complete by the year 2827 , by which time its concept may look dated . But the theory behind Arcosanti and its smaller sibling , Cosanti in Scottsdale , is not architecture but arcology , a word coined by Soleri . Arcology , says Soleri , is the concept of architecture and ecology working as one integral process to produce new urban habitats . Its motif , the architectural form that has impassioned him , is the apse . The apse , till now almost exclusively used in ecclesiastical architecture , makes its appearance in various sizes and guises throughout the scheme . It was originally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from priest to congregation , but the reasons for its use in the context of Arcosanti remain unclear . The development is neither heated nor air conditioned ; perhaps electronic amplification is frowned upon and apses are used as natural loudspeakers . The population of the complex in 1994 stood at about 70 , plus a pride of friendly , contented cats . Critical mass ? the stage when the builders will cease to pay for their work and the completion time of the project will be dramatically shortened ? is slated to happen when the population exceeds 500 . This is not a folly . It is a brave , exciting , and hugely ambitious project . Unfortunately it is also ugly . Should it be abandoned , or fail to be completed , or if Soleri 's theories prove unworkable , then it will become a folly . Poured concrete is yesterday 's material , according to Roy Mason , the architect of Xanadu , the " Home of the Future " in Kissimmee , Florida . " Cross the time threshold of Xanadu , and experience 2001 technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomeration of blobs built in 1983 to demonstrate how houses could be built quickly and cheaply by spraying plastic balloons with polyurethane foam . It took forty days and the cost was $900,000 . With the fervor of the true believer or a Fowler , Mason proclaims that more than one thousand private homes have now been built using this method , that it is bugproof and virtually fireproof , that it can not rot ( so bits of Xanadu will be with us throughout eternity ) , that it is wind resistant and energy efficient . He can not understand why we are not all living in our own private Xanadus . Maybe he 's right . From past performances it is a fair bet that at least one idea from Xanadu will be part of everyday life in a hundred years ' time . Bugproof would be good . Chapter 6 PARKS AND GARDENS Folly gardens and parks are lots of fun . Until now we have looked at the folly to be found in architecture , but that is only one aspect of the made environment . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individuality that shines out from folly shacks and palaces will find expression in even freer forms in parks and gardens . Classical European gardens abounded with allusion and imagery , objects to recall distant lands , buildings to emphasize human folly and frailty . The common inheritance , arrived at independently by creative souls , is for a garden to tell a story . Everyone has a story to tell . Why should it be any odder to tell it in poured concrete rather than in words or music ? This desire , this means of self-expression , is a worldwide phenomenon , investigated pictorially by the Frenchman Bernard Lassus in his pioneering book Jardins Imaginaires , " Dream Gardens . " America has its dream gardens , its parks of passions , where one thought , one obsession drives the builder ( often a man of advancing years ) to throw up structures as regularly and randomly as a dog scratches for fleas . The irritation of obsession will never be satisfied ; few of these parks were or will be completed . As in the Winchester House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When building stops , the glory departs . We are left with the coral reef , multicolored and perhaps beautiful to behold , but the heart is dead . It is then that these unique and extraordinary creations are most at risk . Then they can be torn down or redeveloped . Some few survive , acquiring local fame , becoming low-key tourist attractions for level-five visitors . ( Level One : Disneyland . Level Two : Statue of Liberty . Level Three : Mount Rushmore . Level Four : Bok ' lower Gardens . Level Five : Garden of Eden . Much of this book is written for people who want to know what happens beyond level five . ) The Bible speaks of a garden before it speaks of houses , so it seems reasonable to begin in the beginning with the Garden of Eden . This is not the one that was to be found between the Tigris and the Euphrates , but the one in Lawrence , Kansas , and it was inhabited not by Adam and Eve , but by a Samuel P. Dinsmoor . Dinsmoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1907 and 1929 . He started his work at the age of sixty-four and continued through until five years before his death at eighty-nine . In 1927 he wrote a history of his " Cabin Home in the Garden of Eden , " in which he described the place modestly enough as " the most unique home , for living or dead , on earth . Call and see it . " In 1912 the arrival of Arizona and New Mexico into the Union drove him to erect a concrete Stars and Stripes , and he argued for its federal adoption ? " It would stand out in all kinds of weather " ? although later he was disillusioned by the government represented by Old Glory . " That flag protects capital today better than it does humanity . It drafted the boys but asked the money to volunteer . See the difference ? " But what about level-one attractions like Disneyland ? How did they come about ? Disneyland has inspired theme parks all over the world , but what inspired Disneyland ? The answer may lie buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Orlando , where James N. Gamble , of Proctor and Gamble , built himself a " cracker " house in 1907 . The house was more of a base for sporting recreation than for living in . Day visitors included President Taft , John D. Rockefeller , and H. J. Heinz . Gamble 's adopted daughter , Maud , married a Cincinnati judge , Alfred Nippert , and they too loved the remote little house on Spruce Creek . When Maud died in 1937 Nippert needed something to concentrate on to excise his grief . In December he saw the movie sensation of the year , Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , the first full-length feature cartoon . Nippert fell in love ? not with Snow White , but with the seven dwarfs ' house . Entranced , he sent his carpenter , Ernie Whidmeir , to sit through umpteen showings at the Daytona Beach Theater to get the architectural specifications . Day after day the carpenter sat in the darkened theater , surrounded by awestruck chidren . Whether the movie was too moving for him we 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to obtain some of the the original eels twin the film . Working from the cels Whidmeir produced a full-size replica of the seven dwarfs ' house in under three months , set in the woods of the Gamble House along Spruce Creek . The film premiered on December 21 , 1937 , and Nippert 's seven dwarfs ' house was completed on March 16 , 1938 . It was not just thrown together ; it was superbly built , right down to sash win-dows that drop into the walls , still working perfectly today . Some changes had to be made ? a thatched roof and earthen walls in Florida would become a haven for bugs in a few hours , so the house has a cedar shingle roof and log cabin sides , but the interior is as close as you can get . This raises a philosophical point : which is the real seven dwarfs ' house ? One is tangible , it exists in time and space , but the original exists only on film . It never was . The house at Spruce Creek is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the split log stairs are the headboards of each of the seven dwarfs ' beds , the fireplace is just as exaggeratedly massive as in the film , the locks and door handles are beautifully made from the ubiquitous Florida cypress knees . The ensemble is an uncannily accurate repre-sentation of a fantasy , a real-life sound stage for a cartoon . Enthused by success , Nippert went on to build a witch 's hut from the hollow trunk of a dead cypress , with a cutout of the wicked witch inside , and a little way to the east a two-story rustic tower over the dwarf 's ' diamond mine . There is no shaft ? that would be stretching fantasy a little too far ? and with true American practicality the ground floor of the tower concealed a cistern , but the upper floor was designed as a playhouse for Nippert 's nieces and nephews . The seven dwarfs ' house was a playhouse for the judge , not for children . When this private , miniature theme garden was all complete Judge Nippert invited Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went away impressed . He sent Nippert life-size models of Snow White and the seven dwarfs to enhance the house , and he must have started to think . . . Could it be that this little , half-forgotten folly buried deep in the backwoods was the inspiration behind Orlando 's tourist millions ? The men who planned and built Holy Land USA as a theme park on the top of Pine Hill in Waterbury , Connecticut , insisted that they wished to remain anonymous . They pledged to maintain the services and utilities at the " village " at their own cost , but they did not have the money and power of a Gamble or a Disney . Despite the anonymity , it is readily apparent from the style , layout , and feel that this was the work of one man , and so it proves . John B. Greco , a Waterbury attorney , was the driving force and inspiration behind the park . Holy Land USA consists of scattered collections of small , crude model houses of a faintly Middle Eastern appearance , representing Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from biblical Israel , interspersed with roughly made texts , largely exhortative , from the Bible . It is earnest , honest , passionate work , where the importance of the message far outstrips the competence of the craftsmanship . The result is a touching , affecting , naive innocence ; awful and pathetic in the original true senses of those words . The whole place is so badly done , yet so genuine in its emotion , that it is very hard not to be moved by it . Its current state of dereliction only adds to the pathos . There is a proper time to visit and appreciate all of these parks and gardens . Antone Merton 's religious park 3,000 feet up in the desert at Yucca Valley , California , looks flat , odd , and lifeless , as if Magritte had caught religion and whitewashed his dreams . The park consists of larger-than-life reinforced concrete statues , painted in glittering gloss white , depicting scenes in the life of Jesus . But in harsh daylight the sense of wonder that the park is intended to instill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged , routinely standing among the yuccas , motionless and emotionless . The same park , seen in the black of night in a heavy thunderstorm , occasionally letting a flash of lightning illuminate the figures ? now there would be an impressive and reverential sight . The Reverend Howard Finster built his Paradise Garden , or Plant Farm Museum , in Summerville , Georgia , in 1905 . One wonders how such passionate self-expression could possibly have been conveyed before the rediscovery of concrete , which Finster used in great flowing sweeps , embedding tiles and glass and junk and the Gospel and objets trouve in it , and topping it off with turrets and pinnacles , a hymn evocatively frozen in gravel .

W.H.F. Watching the progression of a folly garden is not dissimilar to watching " Old Faithful " erupt . The drive to convey a message bubbles and steams and belches along until inarticulacy explodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in words , Biblical quotations , homilies , or proverbs , daubed in haste on any available surface : scrap metal , wood , doors , hoardings , anything that provides an accessible surface . Almost invariably the constraints of language finally prove too stifling to convey the required message and the silence of architecture becomes the medium of expression . It was ever thus ; the decipherment of Linear-B allowed us to read Minoan inventories and shopping lists , but it was their architecture that spoke volumes . Charley Kasling had a message to convey , and he chose statuary for his medium . He retired from the Navy in 1947 and went to the California desert for his health . There he made himself a garden and peopled it with ancient gods , characters from the Bible , famed prospectors , warriors , and historical tableaux , made from concrete or carved from sandstone and driftwood . He built long , elegant drystone walls , altars , plinths , at least one pyramid , and everywhere there were statues including ( not unreasonably ) one of himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his little corner of the desert with care and devotion . Charley died in Tucson in 1984 , as old as the century , and now his garden has almost all disappeared , all but the impressive drystone walls and the desert plants left still standing in silent testimony to Driftwood Charley 's lost garden . Fragments remain buried in the desert brush in back of the Sleepy Hollow RV Park on the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation at Andrade , on the Mexican border . The Quechan Indians own the territory , which is populated by quails and snowbirds . The tiny border road is choked with RVs lining up to cross into Los Algodones for cheap teeth and eyeglasses . Hidden from the road and far from the thoughts of the snowbirds lie these pathetic scraps of passion and patriotism . " God Bless America " reads Driftwood Charley 's sole surviving inscription . With equal fervor Romano Gabriel set about ornamenting his yard in Eureka to make the finest flower garden in northern California . The trouble was that , " Eureka bad place for flowers , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Eureka has a mild if rainy climate with no more than a ten-degree temperature variation throughout the year , from cool to very cool . Nevertheless this would not do for the Italian immigrant , doubtless accustomed to sunnier climes . He fabricated his flowers out of wooden crates and packing boxes , which he then painted in rich , patriotic American red , white , and blue and patriotic Italian red , white , and green . Some of his wilder flowers reached heights of twenty feet . When Gabriel died in 1977 his garden was declared a state landmark . This caused a problem in that nobody wanted to buy a house that was totally obscured by wooden flowers , so a solution had to be found . The garden was uprooted and transferred in its entirety to a downtown location on Second Street , where it is viewable all year round , set in a purpose-built room with a glass wall fronting the street . Its preservation is admirable , and this is a solution of a sort , but by compressing the garden so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mystery of the actual garden and lends it the air of a fashionably naive window display in some tony Rodeo Drive boutique . No , I have n't any suggestions as to what else could have been done . Should you decide to visit the replica bottle house in Calico , California , you will pass Possom Trot in Yermo , a garden filled with wooden dolls of every size including " Often Seen Jim and his Limb . " Worth a detour just for the name . The classic garden building has little of the folly about it . Although it is a building for pleasure before purpose , which generally serves as a reasonable guide as to what is and is not a folly , there is nothing of the air of eccentricity that singles out the true folly . A summerhouse or gazebo is a practical if luxurious addition to a private garden ; they are not usually follies . Thus it is interesting to find a few eccentric examples , some dating to the early years of the nation . Life in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was little time to indulge in frivolities in the garden , few leisurely afternoons to be spent sipping tea and watching the hunt from comfortable towers . In 1794 the United States of America was still a gawky adolescent , nervous at the prospect of a looming war with Britain . But in Salem , Massachusetts , the fortunes of Flias Harket Derby had scarcely suffered in the turbulent times . Whether in emulation of the English country estates , or to disprove rumors of his financial precariousness , or simply out of a sense of fun , Derby decided to build himself a teahouse on his estate . And what a teahouse ! As his architect he employed Samuel McIntire , who had recently just missed out on the commission for the Capitol . McIntire knew the rules , but he played with them rather than by them . He produced a hidden masterpiece , a tiny two-story teahouse with all the classical conventions correctly copied but rearranged with a truly American disregard for convention . The life-size wooden statues of the milkmaid and farmboy , perched on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . The result is a really beautiful building that deserves to be famous . It graced the Derby estate for 107 years until it was purchased by Mrs. William Crowninshield Endicott , Sr. , and reerected at The Farm in Danvers , ten miles away . The Farm is now called Glen Magna , and the old Derby-McIntire teahouse , set square like a little Ionic temple on a plinth , pristine and glittering white and looking nearer two than two-hundred years old , is the pride and joy of the Danvers Historical Society . It is an astonishing survival , almost as old as the country , and its survival should be taken as a symbol of America 's recognition of the importance of architectural heritage . It wears its venerable age with grace and ease . There is no garden building of equal importance in America . There was an older garden building , however , built in Annapolis , Maryland , and it can still be seen . The Paca Pavilion was built in the garden of 186 Prince George Street in 1763 by William Paca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maryland . Time and development are equally debilitating , and by 1965 the once-fine formal Paca gardens were buried under a parking lot , a bus station , and a hotel . Historic Annapolis , an action group under the leadership of Saint Clair Wright , campaigned for the state to buy the property and set about restoring ? some would say over-restoring ? the garden . It is now a perfect 1969 interpretation of a grand eighteenth-century garden and , as such , attracts its critics , who forget that without the impetus provided by Ms. Wright and her colleagues , there would now be a high-rise on the site . The little white pavilion is two storied , a domed hexagon on a square base , and all that remained in the 1960s were the traces of the foundations . The building we see today is the creation of landscape architect Laurance Brigham , and is modeled on similar-sized European garden pavilions of the time . Gazebos and summerhouses were always popular in the settled Old World ; the driving , impatient settlers of the New World were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , was about as settled and civilized as one could get in the New World around that time , and it is there that we find what is visually the nearest thing in America to a genuine European garden folly . Just north of Philadelphia on the grounds of the estate called Andalusia , on the banks of the Delaware River , stands a curious little Gothic building , like a sham ruined church . It is called the Grotto , and it was built between 1834 and 1836 for Nicholas Biddle by Thomas U. Walter , as " a retiring room for the ladies . " Bid-die , who was president of the Second Bank of the United States ( on the construction of which Walter had worked as an apprentice bricklayer ) , had employed Walter to add a great hexastyle Doric portico to Andalusia . The plans for the Grotto still exist , showing the tower that was never built . Walter and Biddle obviously had great fun creating this building as light relief from the authoritative Greek Revival style at which Walter excelled . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a garfonniere can be found at the Burnside House in Houma , Louisiana . The garconnieres of nineteenth-century Louisiana were retiring rooms ? although usually cocklofts above the main house ? that were specifically set aside for maturing boys , away from the curious eyes of their younger siblings or the horrified glances of maiden aunts . Pubescent boys were translated from the family envi-ronment and left to erupt through adolescence in solitude . This is a custom well worth reviving . Professional gazebo status can really only be awarded to build-ings with more than four sides , although there is a pair of very early four-gabled Gothic exceptions to be found at Temelec in Sonoma , California . Temelec is now an adult community , where only people over fifty-five years old are allowed to buy . Hidden among the repetitive crescents of similar houses is Temelec Hall , built in 1858 by Granville P. Swift , a member of the Bear Flag Party . It is a refined , colonnaded two-story mansion , used as the country club for the development , and just down from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone with white quoins , overlooking the remains of a small formal garden now invaded by a swimming pool . One house is now used as a little workshop , the other shelters lawn mowers from the torrential rain . Octagonal gazebos are too numerous to list so one will stand for all , hard by the road on the eastern outskirts of Charleston , West Virginia , just curious enough to snap the head round while passing . No peace , no solitude there ; it had to predate the road . As America flexed its financial muscles and money became no object in the late nineteenth century , the new millionaires turned to architecture to relieve the burden of wealth , as so many had done before them . The " cottages " in Newport , Rhode Island , palaces to we ordinary mortals , herd together along Bellevue Avenue against the common hordes as if aware that they , too , were as endangered as the bison . To European eyes the gardens in which these mansions are set seem pitifully small , all heart and no lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to The Elms , so we followed the catering van in and drove around to the back , where we found two teahouses on the grounds , ornate little garden pavilions dimly glimpsed through the downpour as guards squished across the sodden lawn to tell us what we already knew . There is something about rain and gazebos that goes together well . Down the road , Marble House has a Chinese teahouse overlooking the sea . More interesting and much less known in the same state is a pavilion erected to the memory of a favorite cow at North Farm in Bristol , " America 's Most Patriotic City " ( the double lines in the middle of the road are painted red , white , and blue ) . Pleasant and unremarkable save for its raison d'etre , the Cow Pavilion now stands on the grounds of a condominium . Did Columbus have a beard ? This burning question was the cause of years of argument between the sculptor Ferdinand Miller and his client Henry Shaw . Shaw commissioned Miller to cast a bronze statue of the politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prairie on the edge of the village of Saint Louis , Missouri . Shaw had begun landscaping his park in 1868 , by which time Saint Louis was something more than a village . Realizing that any decent park was much more than an assemblage of interesting plants and trees , he commissioned architects and sculptors to frame and decorate the park . His great achievement was to produce the first authentic sham ruin in America , a country crying out for decent ruins . In 1867 Saint Louis had for four years been the proud possessor of the country 's largest hotel , the Lindell on sixth and Washington streets . Designed by Thomas Walsh , it had taken seven years to build ; that year it burned down . Shaw acquired blocks of the elaborately carved , smoke-blackened , water-hosed limestone , and with the help of his gardener , James Gurney , assembled two ruins in the best English landscape garden tradition . They arc not , sadly , great works of art ? a century earlier an architectural critic had corn-mented that building a ruin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and difficulty also in creating a building of this kind . It is not every man , who can build a house , that can execute a ruin . To give the stone it 's mouldering appearance ? to make the widening chink run naturally through all the joints ? to mutilate the ornaments ? to peel the facing from the internal structure ? to shew how correspondent parts have once united ; tho now the chasm runs wide between them ? and to scatter heaps of ruin around with negligence and ease ; are great efforts of art ; much too delicate for the hand of a common workman ; and what we very rarely see performed . Besides , after all that art can bestow , you must put your ruin at last into the hands of nature to adorn , and perfect it . If the mosses , and lychens grow unkindly on your walls ? if the streaming weather-stains have produced no variety of tints ? if the ivy refuses to mantle over your buttress ; or to creep among the ornaments of your Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang from the cleft ; or long , spiry grass to wave over the shattered battlement ? your ruin will be still incomplete ? you may as well write over the gate , Built in the year 1772 . Deception there can be none . ? William Gilpin , Observations Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty , 1772 Shaw 's ruin is much too neat and ordered ; there is no mystery or imagination about it . But facing it in the Sailboat Pond is a stroke of genius : a three-tiered fountain painted a particularly repellent pale turquoise is perched on a false island made out of all the really interesting carved scraps of capitals , cartouches , entablatures , and other architectural detritus taken from the ruined hotel . This architectural island is unique in the country and , as far as I know , in the world . It is rather prettily floodlit at night , lessening the impact of the color scheme . But I digress . What about Columbus 's beard ? The statue of Columbus in front of the Coit Tower in San Francisco is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was bearded ; Miller was equally convinced of the opposite . You will have already realized that the wishes of the client always take precedence over those of the artist : the Columbus statue in Tower Grove Park has a full Old Testament beard . Miller still felt strongly about the matter . Hidden under Christopher 's cloak is a disclaimer signed by the artist , refusing all responsibility for the offending whiskers . At the Boothe Memorial Park in Stratford , Connecticut , the eccentricity comes not just from the individual buildings but from their juxtaposition . Two brothers , David and Stephen Boothe , built a summer cottage in their backyard . Summer cottages are usually located hundreds of miles away from the year-round home , not a hundred yards away on the same property , but nothing the Boothes did was conventional . They began their park in 1913 . The Clock Tower Museum is the most eccentric building of the lot ; the Technocratic Cathedral is soberly described in the National Register inventory as " very idiosyncratic in design . " David Boothe , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-sided , fourcornered blacksmith 's shop , bragged that his blacksmith 's shop had a much more interesting total of forty-four sides , which it does by means of a convoluted array of false buttresses disguising a humdrum four-sided blacksmith 's shop . The brothers built a leaning tower , " neither round , nor square , nor plumb , " ( it was actually octagonal ) that took to its role with too much enthusiasm and is consequently no longer with us . The top of Stratford lighthouse replaced the leaning tower , a suitably Boothelike addition . " Fancy architects have come to gawk , and we never went to architecture school , " boasted the Boothes . Along the Connecticut coast in Greenwich two outbuildings dating from the 1920s and 1930s on the John D. Chapman estate on Round Island exhibited whimsy almost worthy of the Boothes . The Lodge was a five-car garage stone built with the upper story timber framed and filled with wattle and daub .

A beach pavilion on the shore is disguised as a sham ruined monastery , with heavy buttresses , an uneven roof line , and arched walls . Used brick and imported stone were employed by architect Spencer Guidal to create the effect . Many of the folly sites found in America come with gardens of equal perplexity and merit , sometimes bundled with their more famous partners , sometimes waiting quietly in the wings for recognition . Tom Kelly 's bottle house in Rhyolite , Nevada , has a strange little garden built by Kelly 's successor " Tommy " Thompson . It is a crude model in cement and glass of the houses in the ghost town , protected by a fence made from broken bottle necks strung along a wire , glinting and turning in the sunshine . There is a rock garden behind the Desert Watch Tower at Jacumba Hot Springs , California , but it is unlike any rock garden you might expect . An engineer by the name of W. T. Ratcliffe arrived in the area in the early 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower . He discovered that they lent themselves well to carving and , inspired by their prehistoric waterworn shapes , he proceeded to adapt them here and there to create a petrified menagerie . Over a period of three years he carved a turtle , a Gila monster , a fish , a coiled rattlesnake , a buffalo , a crested lizard , a dinosaur , a huge skull with grinning white teeth ? a monster from Sesame Street forty years before its time , an alligator facing off -a lizard , the head of an Indian , and more . At first they are difficult to make out in the blinding white desert light , then suddenly they leap into three dimensions . In some cases mouths and eyes are daubed with red and white paint for emphasis . The alligator is only completed on one side ; perhaps Ratcliffe died or he simply lost interest and wandered on . It is a bizarre assembly . A few miles southwest of Redmond , Oregon , is another strange rock garden , this one created by a Danish immigrant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges , castles , terraces , towers , ponds , and mansions out of exotic sounding rocks and stones like obsidian and agate . The area around Grant 's Tomb at the end of 122nd Street in Manhattan is covered with a fanfare of colored tiles and mosaics , applied not just to the benches but also to the weird , twisted , convoluted pillars of concrete that entwine the benches and the formal area surrounding the gigantic mausoleum . The colorful but anachronistic project was started by a Chilean artist , Pedro Silva , who had been inspired by Anton Gaudi 's Benches of Barcelona . It became a public arts scheme , and was designed and carried out by local people , from children to senior citizens . Against the solemn grandeur of architect John Duncan 's reinterpretation of the Tomb of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus , the festive benches provide a pleasantly jarring counterpoint . A survey carried out by the park rangers who work at the tomb showed that 50 percent of visitors liked the benches , 30 percent disliked them , and 20 percent thought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Grant 's Tomb . " A sizeable garden unrelieved by architecture will be poorly planned ; all ordered landscapes benefit from buildings . Throughout America , all the great gardens will have structures where one can rest and appreciate the surroundings , from the studied informality of a rustic , thatched summerhouse built by Theodore Wirth in 1903 in the rose garden of Elizabeth Park in West Hartford , Connecticut , to the faux-Tudor half-timbering of Edsel Ford 's children 's playhouse at Grosse Pointe , Michigan , or the austere formality of Alfred Victor du Pont and Gabriel Massena 's gloriette and tower at Nemours , Delaware , constructed in the 1930s . One might think that the days of sustained garden architecture were passing , if not already over , so it is startling and exciting to discover in Ohio a substantial collection of recent garden buildings , including giocchi d'acqua , a nymphaeum , guest room , grotto , sham ruin , bridge , and torrent . The follies have been created over a period of twenty years in a secluded garden outside Cincinnati by Theodore Gantz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake a pavilion flanks a stream , on the other side of which a ruined wall closes the view . Scraps of half-remembered building jut out of the crumbled masonry , years of building upon building stretching back over the centuries ? one-fifth of a century in this case . A delightful septagonal room lit from above has the skull of a unicorn to detain the visitor momentarily before crossing a tiny covered bridge to a guest bedroom . This is where the fun begins ? outside , the courtyard is paved with tiny pebbles , a mosaic of red , white , and gray , fronting a nymphaeum from which water flows . Linger too long , however , and your host will be tempted to pull a hidden lever . The paved courtyard explodes into a dozen fountains , drenching the hapless visitor . This is a very old joke , popular in sixteenth-century Italy , and still not remotely amusing . With dampened enthusiasm we descend a couple of steps into a grotto cavern . To the left and right are thunder rooms , tiny circular chambers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere eight feet or so ? but the volume as they fall is deafening , cleverly amplified by the acoustic shape of the little recesses . The earth seems to shift under the force of the torrent ; minutes ago and yards away you were dry , warm , and comfortable . Niches at the side of the facing wall let in to a lenticular room with a large fountain in front . Pressed wetly against the back wall you are by now soaked and ready for just about anything , except for the size of the spider crouching just above your head , with a good six-foot leg span . Chuckling malevolently , your host reaches up and yanks a leg . Slowly , the great clamshell in front of you opens and Venus emerges , flanked by dolphins guardant . Transfixed , you await the inevitable , and inexorably it comes . Jets of water shoot out from every imaginable orifice and souse your feet . Very funny . Chapter 7 SOLEMN TEMPLES Nothing caught the imagination of American archi tects like the Greek Revival . The tetrastyle portico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as native to the United States . Its simple , classic elegance , its adaptability , its suitability for a climate similar to Greece in many parts , its authority ? all these factors point to its success . There is now more Grecian architecture in America than there is in Greece . The circular temple with six , eight , or ten columns supporting a dome can be found everywhere . Properly called a monopteros , there are examples in every state : the bandstand temple on the Common in Boston ; the Love Temple in the beautiful Longwood Gardens in Kennet Square , Pennsylvania ; the Doric-domed rotunda in George Rogers Clark National Historic Park in Vincennes , Indiana ; the thin , pale example allegedly made from tin in Mount Storm Park over-looking Cincinnati ? there are too many to count . Someone , some-day , will make a register of them . The Parthenon , that symbol of Athens , is not the magnificent temple it once was . It has never really recovered from being blown up in the seventeenth century when the Turks were using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has disappeared , as has the roof and most of the interior , Athenians have used it as a convenient quarry ? it 's in a sorry state . If you want to see it in its true glory , however , there is no need to make that tedious transatlantic jour ney : a much brighter , newer , and perhaps slightly bigger version can be found in Nashville , Tennessee . The Museum of Art in Philadel phia , Pennsylvania , is on a similar scale , built in 1928 above the Schuylkill River with pavilions below echoing the Greek theme , but added by the Fairmount Water Works . What the Greeks gave the world were themes . The Temple of the Winds in Athens was not a temple but a water clock , and its satisfying octagon shape with two porticos has been copied and echoed around the western world . Richard Franklin Sammons , a young New York architect , borrowed the theme for a gardener 's house he designed for an estate in Virginia in 1993 , while Jones and Herrin , a practice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe little Temple of Ceres for a client in northern Florida who wanted something , but was n't quite sure what . Now that it has been built , the owner thinks he may sit in it and read . Decisions , decisions . The same practice added a Roman facade to the side of a garage in their hometown , providing a stage-set sham temple to screen the view of the garage from the main 1854 house . There is even a Temple of Convenience : behind a house in Georgetown , Colorado , is an authentic Greek Revival temple as a privy , a six-holer no less , with cupola , cornice , and porch , designed by W. A. Hammill in the 1880s . Brendan Gill , that mainstay of the New Yorker , listed the " pillared Palladian folly on West 57th Street leading into the ParkerMeridien Hotel " as one of his twenty-four Bests of New York . Daniel Burnham 's precept to " make no little plans " has been followed avidly throughout America . In 1922 the city fathers of Lakeland in Florida wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in state legislator Thomas W. Bryant . When Henry Plant 's new railroad steamed through Polk County in 1884 , the sleepy farming community of Lakeland suddenly had the opportunity to reach export markets . The little settlement prospered and became a small town . The small town boomed , and became a city . Funds were raised to finance urban development , for roads , utilities , and the purchase of Lake Mirror in the center of the city . In 1926 Bryant wrested approval for the construction of a colonnaded promenade around Lake Mirror from a reluctant chamber of commerce , who already saw the end of the boom in sight . Work started , to the designs of Charles W. Leavitt , in 1927 . The stock market crash was looming , but building was completed by April 1928 . Lakeland then had the magnificent Lake Mirror Promenade and a massive debt . There is a mighty loggia at the head of the lake , and a colonnaded walkway encircling it ; the effect is Pompeiian on a grand scale . It is startling to come across this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical American downtown , and its existence and recent renovation has stimulated the city to a general restoration and rejuvenation . Debts are paid , amortised , defaulted upon , lost , settled , and forgotten about , but a sweeping architectural statement like the columns at Lakeland will speak for the city long after the folly of its overstretched financial resources has been forgotten . Southern Minnesota has a hideous temple monument to Hermann the German , built by Julius Berndt in 1897 . This is not a Teutonic joke ; there really was a Hermann the German and he was a big hero to the German-speaking settlers of New Ulm . The round temple , set on a high plinth , is irredeemably ugly , with an iron staircase wandering about uncertainly before it finally realizes it has to reach the ceiling , on the dome of which stands a 32-foot statue of Hermann wielding a sword . Hermann was the leader of the Cherusci tribe who unified Germans in 9 A.D. and drove the Romans back across the Rhine . Nearly 2,000 years later a monument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans never had a monopoly on temples , however . Their style may have been all pervasive , but the architecture of other creeds is equally majestic . I have yet to discover the stupendous stupas of Angkor Wat in America , but a charming little sandstone Hindu temple sits on the campus at Florida Southern College in Lakeland , the gift of Bishop Frederick Fisher . Fisher went as a missionary to India and managed to convert an entire village , including the Hindu priest . The bishop then climbed the village temple and placed a cross on top . He ordered a replica of the temple from Benares to commemorate this startling event , and had it shipped to Massachusetts . One month before he died in 1936 , Fisher visited the Florida Southern campus and offered the temple to the college . The tiny 25-foot high temple , set in its own little garden at the head of a reflecting pool , has room for one Hindu worshiper or two or three friendly nonworshipers . It is rather overwhelmed by the half-dozen or so Frank Lloyd Wright buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it more prominent . Stupas are suggested by the multidomed , oxblood-colored roof of the Vedanta Center 's Old Temple at Webster and Filbert Streets in San Francisco . Admired even by natives , it is a miniature Kremlin below Pacific Heights , designed by the leader of the sect Swami Trigunatitananda with the architect Joseph A. Leonard . It was built in 1905 , surviving the 1906 earthquake , and the thinking behind its onion dome ( orthodox Christianity ) , Moorish dome ( Islam ) , and remarkable Jain-inspired cluster of spired domes ( Hindu ) is that Vedanta teachings acknowledge all the world 's major religions . It now describes itself as spiritually affiliated with the Ramakrishna Order . The World 's Largest Jigsaw Puzzle can be found near Greynolds Park , north of Miami . The Church of Saint Bernard de Clairvaux is a chapel and cloister without a monastery . It was bought at a cost of half a million dollars from Segovia , Spain , in 1925 by William Randolph Hearst , and was intended to surround the Neptune swimming pool at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloisters were impounded in New York by the Department of Agriculture due to an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in Segovia ; the crates were broken open and the hay cushioning the stones was taken out and burned . The stones were then put back in the wrong crates . Hearst understandably lost inter-est . In 1952 the boxes were bought by two businessmen who intend-ed the cloisters to be a tourist attraction . They shipped the crates to Miami and spent nineteen months and $1.5 million figuring out how to reassemble the stones . Eventually they sold the partially reconstructed cloisters ( there are a whole bunch of stones at the back that do n't seem to fit anywhere ) to the Episcopalians who now use it as a conventional church . Surrounded and shaded by venera-ble banyan trees , it is a favorite spot for Cuban brides to be pho-tographed in their wedding finery . THE GREAT GLOBE ITSELF English is an extraordinary language . There are two words for practically everything . It 's like playing an organ with two keyboards , one Latin and one Old English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a grotto , and over the years they have acquired shades of meaning that allow us to differentiate between two manifestations of the same thing . The Catholic Church sees a grotto as a quasi-religious shrine , whereas garden historians see it as a decorated cave . To the Catholic hierarchy , grottoes figure largely as a gentle form of self-expression by the people , a little leeway from a closely observed rite . Napoleon Pelletier was born in Canada in 1857 . He and a group of fellow Catholics would travel to Lake Wales in central Florida to escape the crisp and even Canadian winters , and they brought their deep faith with them . In 1921 they built a small white church five miles out of town , and Napoleon was driven to erect a great grotto apse , flanked by small arches , dedicated to Saint Anne . The reverent little community lasted until the outbreak of World War II , when Pelletier died . The tiny shrines , fountains , and altars gently decayed , until a suspiciously commercial revival in the 1950s again brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk of miracle cures , and money changing hands , and 75,000 visitors in a year . It had to be stopped . The bishop of Florida ordered it to be closed ; the church was torn down and the grotto cleared of its revered artifacts . Saint Anne Shrine is now a peaceful lakeside community , but at the foot of the lake remains a peculiar cone-shaped structure built of rubbly stone , and a rustic bridge , and deeper into the wood comes the shock of this towering grotto apse , lurking in the undergrowth , still with pleas and prayers and offerings lying on its unofficial altar . There is also Pelletier 's gravestone , but his body was removed long ago . The most touching of all American grotto makers was James Hampton , an impoverished black man from Elloree , South Carolina . He worked as a short-order cook , got conscripted , was honorably discharged in 1945 , and ended up in Washington , where he found work as a janitor . He rented a garage in the seedy neighborhood where he lived , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him ; he had no friends to speak of . He spent all his spare time in his locked garage . Not until he died was his secret fully revealed . For fifteen years James Hampton had been building a throne for God in his garage , a glittering array of sedilia , lecterns , offertory tables , and pulpits , all girded with gold and silver foil , gleaming in the dull light . None of James 's fellow humans had visited James in his garage , but God , Moses , Adam , and the Blessed Virgin Mary had been there . Moving on to a more secular definition of the word , we encounter grottoes that incorporate a world of sea shells and snails , of water and whimsy . The great lexicographer Samuel Johnson remarked that " a grotto is a very fine place ? for a toad , " and it is certainly true that the best grottoes are cold , dank , damp places , or cool , fertile , watery havens , depending on your point of view . There has recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage and conservation movement gains momentum in America , people with the specialist knowledge and skills needed to restore grottoes have found their services in demand not only for the renovation of public works but also for creating entirely new private grottoes . Two of the new grotto builders are Theodore Gantz from Cincinnati and Belinda Eade from London . Eade , in collaboration with the British sculptor Simon Verity , recently completed a substantial grotto in six months , working in a private garden designed by Bostonian Keith Leblanc in Fort Worth , Texas . Gantz has spent twenty years on a major project for a client in Ohio : a group of structures at the end of a large lake that incorporate a figure of Neptune with a trident , gravel and pebble gardens , a Tuscan farmhouse , giocchi d'acqua ( water tricks that drench unwary visitors ) , and a shell grotto . A fuller description of this remarkable work can be found in the chapter on parks and gardens . Aurora , Indiana , has that rarest of garden delights , a prospect grotto . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gothic beauty built by Thomas Gaff in 1851 , is a tiny grotto set in the steep hillside overlooking the Ohio River . On top are the remains of four little seats for drinking in the view , which now features an active petrochemical works belching out yellow smoke . The Venetian Pool in Coral Gables , Florida , was originally a quarry from which limestone was hewn for house building . This left a great unsightly hole in the middle of an upmarket Miami suburb , so it was decided to fill it with water to make a vast swimming pool . Then , in 1924 , Denman Fink had the idea of carving grottoes out of the coral rock , adding bridges , towers , and striped poles and creating an idealized Venetian lagoon , presumably without all the dead cats , stench , and streetwalkers of the original . This was used to pro mote the residential development , as it looked undeniably exotic , but people had to be paid to splash around in it : " I 've never known water as cold , either as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motel man-ager , " and I lived in Wisconsin for thirty years before coming back to Coral Gables . " Seen on a muggy December morning , with ten drils of fog curling round the piscina poles , the huge , empty pool has an other-worldly look , deserted , mysterious , and magical . By most accounts the first humans appeared to be cave dwellers , and some of us ca n't quite shake the habit . South of Moab , Utah , is the Home n ' the Rock , a house carved into a large rock . This was surely not done to get away from it all , as it is alleged that the sign advertising the place can be seen from orbiting spacecraft . The inhabitants of Cave City , near the Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky , have exploited the natural local rock 's propensity to form interesting holes by attracting tourists from all over to see if they really do lead a troglodytic existence . ( They do n't . ) Our ancestors may well have been cave dwellers , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of an arboreal existence has a certain seductive charm . I have yet to see a tree house in America although I have heard of several ? Max Schroff 's tree house dating from the 1880s in Rock River , Wisconsin ; a tree house built by Morton B. Ewing forty feet up in a buttonwood tree in Hel-lam , Pennsylvania ; and the John Fremont Redwood Tree House in Santa Cruz , California . In Hellam I was sidetracked by a house in the shape of a shoe and Ewing 's tree house , if it still exists , remains to be discovered . There is a pleasant story about a guy in Athens , Georgia , who was particularly fond of one tree on his property . He made a will in favor of the tree , so now it is known as the Tree That Owns Itself . We usually expect tree houses to be perched among branches , but the California redwoods are so huge that it is theoret-ically possible to live inside one . In Eureka a deliberately different " house " was hollowed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its side , along Highway 101 . Known as Stump House , it has been a souvenir shop since 1902 . The World Famous Tree House is five miles south of Piercy on the same road . Inside the living tree a space has been hollowed out to make a room 20 feet by 27 feet , and 50 feet high . The tree itself is 250 feet tall . The inside space has served as a barn , a blacksmith 's shop , and sleeping quarters for thirty-two convicts . It used to be called the Fraternal Monarch , then the Quadruped Tree , but it has always been a tourist attraction . Arriving in Leggett to see the One Log House , another " house " hacked out of a redwood trunk , we discovered that , after a promotional tour around the country for the California Redwood Organization , it had been parked up in Phillipsville , forty miles north and through which we 'd just come . So we comforted ourselves by seeing if a Lincoln Town Car could squeeze through the Chandelier Tree , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tree at six miles an hour , you can get through it at sixty .
