There were plenty of problems when we arrived in his front yard . Driveways hemmed in the yard like concrete end zones . The shapeless plot of grass directed views to the paving , not to the house . The existing plants grew in one long , overgrown row . Sketching a plan was our first step . Because the newly remodeled porch is now the focal point of the house , we shaped the lawn to direct attention toward the porch . Instead of a straight row of plants across the front of the house , we designed curving beds that frame the new shape of the lawn . The damaged maple in the center of the lawn had to go . Existing trees always seem like bonus features that come with your house ; the decision to cut one down is never easy to make . In this case , removing the maple opened the view of the prettiest part of the house . Is also easier to mow a lawn that does n't have trees growing in the middle of it . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong spot . Smaller trees can be moved , especially if you wait until cool weather when the tree enters dormancy . ( Left ) Shaping the lawn meant reducing its size . We sprayed Roundup ( an herbicide that kills everything ) on the grass inside the areas we wanted to convert to planting beds . Then we shovel-cut the painted line to delineate the curving bed line . ( Above ) The planting area across the front of the house sloped downhill to the driveway . We added new topsoil along the face of the house to reduce the slope and to improve planting conditions . The new soil was tilled to get the nutrients near plant roots . ( Left ) We chose our plants to complement the color of the brick . Dark-green foliage pairs nicely with the red multitoned brick house . Tip : Set out your plants before digging holes . Stand back and look at the composition ; then adjust spacing and turn plants so that the best face is angled toward the most common view . SECRET INGREDIENTS ( Left ) Removing grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass to kill it , and then dig holes through the dead or dying grass . Dig your hole twice as wide as each plant 's container ; use your shovel handle to measure . Add a thick layer of mulch on top of the remaining sprayed grass . Repeat plants in your yard . We planted Heller Japanese hollies around both the porch and the landing . Oakleaf hydrangeas thrive beneath an existing maple on one side of the yard as well as beside a dogwood near the front walk . Masses of liriope , leftovers from the original landscape , are great for filling in planting beds throughout the yard . Use the same kind of plant on both sides of your walkway . This trick makes the walkway an integral part of the design . You feel as though you are walking through the landscape , not just across a yard . Show off flowering deciduous plants against an evergreen backdrop . We planted lusterleaf hollies in a zigzag pattern along the property line to block the view of the neighbor 's driveway . Mock orange , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses its leaves in the winter , making it an excellent choice to plant in front of the hollies . Different plants can do the same job . We needed a low , bright-green plant to border the curving lawn near the porch . We chose Southern shield fern to edge the sunny beds . But we planted hostas as the border plant in the shady beds beneath the dogwood . Trying to grow the same plant both places would have resulted in frustration , due to the different amounts of sunlight each bed receives . ( Left ) Gently score the root ball of container-grown plants with a trowel before planting . This encourages roots to spread beyond the compacted form into the surrounding soil . Marking paint makes translating the plan to the ground easy . This bright paint comes in an inverted can specially made for spraying upside down . Marking paint costs about $8 a can and is usually available at hardware stores . If you spray a line incorrectly , scuff it with your foot and mark a new one . <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
