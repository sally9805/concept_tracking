U.S. Marshals , the country 's first police force , led the way in taming the frontier . // DEPUTY United States Marshal James B. " Wild Bill " Hickok was tired . He had spent the day chasing thieves who had stolen government property near North Platte , Neb . The handsome , 6-foot-2 lawman had caught most of them . But two escaped and planned to ambush Wild Bill while he ate dinner at a restaurant . A waitress heard the bandits boasting about their plan on her way to work . As the waitress was bringing Hickok his dinner , she spotted one of the outlaws coming in from the street , the other coming in the back door . They hoped to catch Wild Bill in crossfire . The waitress alerted the lawman . " Thanks , little girl , " he said . " Please stand to one side at once . " Hickok went into action . His left hand slipped to his left hip and came up with a Colt revolver . A shot snapped out . The man at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hickok spun around , his right hand rising with his other revolver . Crack ! Down went the other thief . Photograph Photograph // Wild Bill Hickok was already a legend by that year of 1867 . He had gained fame as a scout and spy for the Union Army during the Civil War and as a lawman afterward . He later served as marshal of two rowdy Kansas frontier towns , Hays and Abilene . Marshals Service Born in 1789 The nation 's first police officers13 U.S. marshals-were appointed by President George Washington in 1789 . Their main job was to protect the brand-new Federal courts . Gradually they were given other tasks . One was to bring law and order to the rough-and-ready villages that sprang up as settlers moved west . That job was the work of Wild Bill Hickok and hundreds of other deputy U.S. marshals during the late 19th century . It was dangerous work . More than 100 U.S. marshals were killed in the line of duty during that time . Gunfight at the O.K. Corral Unlike Wild Bill Hickok , who killed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow to fire his long-barreled Colt revolver . Until the last few weeks of his 10 years as a lawman , Earp had shot to kill only once . In the Old West , that was remarkable . Earp preferred to stop lawbreakers by cracking them over the head with the butt of his revolver . But during those last few weeks of his career as a lawman , Earp got caught up in the most famous gun battle in the West , the " Gunfight at the O.K. Corral " in October 1881 in Tombstone , Ariz . With Wyatt were his brothers Virgil and Morganboth lawmen too-and their friend Doc Holliday , a gambler and former dentist . Facing them on the street a half block from the O.K. Corral were four members of a gang of cattle rustlers and stagecoach robbers . They had sworn to kill the Earp brothers . The Earps , all wearing black coats and hats , marched down the street with Doc Holliday , dressed in long gray garb . When they were within six feet of the outlaws , Virgil Earp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant , guns spat lead . A minute later , three outlaws lay dead . Virgil and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday were wounded . Wyatt Earp was untouched . The gunfight did not end the feud . A few months later Morgan Earp was shot to death in a pool hall . Wyatt gunned down three gang members he blamed for Morgan 's murder . The killings were the only black marks on a great career for a lawman . The Death of Bill the Kid Three months earlier , a deputy U.S. marshal killed the Old West 's most famous outlaw . The outlaw was called Billy the Kid , a short , skinny , boyish-looking man of 21 . His real name was Henry McCarty . He had killed at least four men on the Southwestern frontier . He also had a part in killing five others . Some people believed he had killed up to 21 men , mostly in New Mexico . Deputy U.S. Marshal Patrick Garrett was the sheriff of Lincoln County , N.M. , and a Federal lawman . Lincoln County was where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy the Kid gunned down as many as 21 frontiersmen . Then Marshal Pat Garrett finally stopped the cold-blooded killer . // FRONTIER FIREPOWER // In November 1880 , Pat Garrett formed a posse of 13 men to catch Billy the Kid and his gang . The posse trapped the outlaws in a house near Fort Sumner , more than 100 miles from Lincoln , and they surrendered . Billy the Kid was tried and found guilty of murder . He was sentenced to hang on May 13 , 1881 . Two weeks before that date , Billy broke out of jail in Lincoln , killing two guards . He then did something that almost assured his capture . He went right back to Fort Sumner instead of fleeing the territory . Deputy Marshal Garrett could n't believe it . He started after Billy July 10 . Garrett and two of his deputies surprised Billy the Kid on the night of July 14 . In the darkness , Billy did not know who they were . Most of the people in Fort Sumner spoke Spanish . Billy called out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He must then have recognized me , " Pat Garrett said later , " for he went backward with a cat-like movement , and I jerked my gun and fired . " The bullet dropped Billy the Kid . The Marshals Mission The Old West is history . So are the brave deputy U.S. marshals who brought law and order to the frontier . // THE U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE TODAY // But the marshals today are a big part of Federal law enforcement . Their job is still to protect Federal courts and ensure the effective operation of the judicial system . After more than 200 years , the U.S. Marshals Service lives on , keeping us safe , whether it 's in the O.K. Corral or the Supreme Court . <p>
