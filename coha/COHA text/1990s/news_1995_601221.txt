<p> Bette Midler admits there are times when she wants to quit . <p> And this might be a good time to do it , now that her relationship with Disney is ended , she 's leaving Atlantic Records after 23 years for Warner Bros. and is forsaking Los Angeles for New York . <p> " I often speak about ( quitting ) to my husband , " she says , " but he says I 'm not finished yet . Maybe it 's just time for a change . In Los Angeles , you 're 25 years old , you go out to the pool , you lie down , wake up and you 're 75 . I did n't want that to happen to me . We were in the earthquake and it was pretty hair-raising . I 'll never forget that noise as long as I live . And my husband said , ' We got ta get out of here ! ' " <p> As a result , the 48-year-old Midler may be taking her life to a new level . <p> After submitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , her development company is looking elsewhere , and a project in the works would team Midler and Martin Scorsese . ( She 's mum on details . ) <p> More immediately , though , she wrapped up Bette of Roses , her first non-film-related album in five years . Due for release Tuesday , it 's the first album tailored to her newly expanded voice , which came about when she found a new vocal coach while working on Gypsy . Midler had to be coaxed into pushing her boundaries , but was exhilarated . <p> " I got this brand-new voice . It 's great to sing songs that move people , but to get a whole new bunch of notes , that 's really a thrill , " she says . <p> It 's possible that the last thing Midler needs is more talent . The eternal problem with huge , original personalities such as hers is funneling them into the narrow pop music airplay categories . <p> Midler has had megahits ( The Rose and Wind Beneath My Wings ) , but some of her 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scud missile , occasionally creating explosions but often flying close to the ground , off the radar screens . <p> " You wish the playlists were much wider - it 's annoying , " she says . " But you know what ? People are making money off them . So I sing what I want to sing - and hope for the best . " <p> Of course , she wants to be up to date - she ca n't be The Divine Miss M forever - and that 's why Bette of Roses was such a painstaking operation . Her longtime producer , Arif Mardin , says they went through more than 50 songs to come up with 12 that worked and suited her . They turned down well-known tunesmiths for lesser-known female writers such as Maria McKee , who wrote the album 's first single , To Deserve You . <p> For a woman as independent as Midler , it might seem like a bizarre choice : The song can be heard as a co-dependent woman idolizing her lover . Midler strenuously disagrees : " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callas and Edith Piaf . It 's not a song about being a doormat . It 's about saying thank you . It does n't have to be sung to a human being . It could be sung to a god . " And Midler knows about divinity . <p> Elsewhere , the album is loaded with inspirational ballads , though the opening cut , I Know This Town , is a discreet foray into country rock . Clearly , there 's lots of thought and work behind it , unlike some artists who blow off the last album of a contract . " I have enough crap out there , and I have to live with it , " she says . " I made the record I set out to make . I like it . " <p> Not everything she likes has taken off , and part of it is a marketing problem . Though Atlantic president Val Azzoli considers her perhaps the label 's most prestigious artist - no matter how variable her sales and film grosses , her name recognition only grows - her audience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more mainstream admirers who discovered her with Wind Beneath My Wings . <p> For that reason , Atlantic is covering all bases , including a sexy , kittenish video version of To Deserve You with Midler all in white . " At the end of the day , MTV is n't looking for Bette Midler , " Azzoli admits . " But you have to get everybody all the time . People you think she 'd appeal to do n't like her . And people you would n't think she appeals to , do like her . We 're going to ask her to do as many talk shows as she can . " <p> The question is whether Midler still has the patience for it . The anything-goes personality of the 1970s has given way to a highly opinionated woman in the 1990s . " When you get older , " she says , " you start saying , ' Why do people do things like this ? This is really stupid ! ' Do n't get me started . I have a lot of half-baked ideas and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas . " <p> The list runs from politicians who care only about opinion polls ( " they 're supposed to be the fixers ! " ) to the psychiatric community for allowing Ronald Reagan to empty out the mental institutions and put the patients on the street . <p> She drives herself crazy with the complexity of such issues , but it 's the price of a social conscience . The one issue in which she 's active is cleaning up New York . She used to joke about wanting to be sanitation commissioner . Not now . <p> " I came back to this town and said , ' This is unacceptable . ' Now I have a group called the Manhattan Restoration Project . I brought these guys out from Los Angeles and I pay for everything . People say , ' The taxes pay for it . ' But somebody 's not doing it . So I guess I 'll do it . " <p> What 's divine , what 's not <p> Bette Midler has become a woman of many opinions . Here are a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were supposed to submit things to me and they missed their submissions two years in a row . So it 's over . It 's OK . I love them , they love me . But it 's tough out there . We had our days in Disney when we submitted 100 projects to the powers that be and did n't get anything going . " <p>  --  On her resurrected concert career : " It was about throwing off the shackles of Hollywood and kicking out the jams . I was remembering , ' Oh , that 's what I used to do ! That 's why they liked me . ' I was n't conforming to somebody else 's idea or worrying about the grosses . " <p>  --  On her diverse audience : " I just do what I do and they get along as they get along . In one of my concerts , somebody said they were sitting in back of a big , bodybuilding plumber who sang along the whole show . The challenge is to make them feel like they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elevator together . " <p>  --  On her sexy new video : " I could n't help myself . I was trussed up like a Christmas goose in that dress and it just made me want to be that . The song , To Deserve You , has such a sneaky little groove . "
