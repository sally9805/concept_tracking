<p> At first glance , they look like so many marbles . Glossy and curved , they shine blue and green and brown and gold . <p> But they are a precious gift to the people who come to June Nichols ' office in Des Plaines with an empty socket where an eye used to be . <p> Nichols is one of a handful of ocularists in the Chicago area , combining art and medicine to craft artificial eyes for people who have lost their vision to trauma or disease . <p> In many cases her custom-made prostheses are virtually indistinguishable from a real eye . Nichols uses tiny artists ' brushes and as many as 14 different shades of paint to create an iris that matches someone 's remaining good eye . She uses red silk carpet threads to mimic the look of capillaries . <p> Even the white of the eye is customized because not everyone 's white is the same shade . <p> Nichols , 50 , did n't plan to get into this line of work . But when she graduated from college with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocularist 's office because she thought she could use her artistic skills painting and shaping eyes . She opened her own office in 1989 . <p> Nichols sees herself as more than an artist . She is also a caregiver during crisis . <p> " I have to listen and hold their hand and tell them everything is going to be all right , " she said . <p> Sometimes she has to gently guide them back to reality , for instance when they ask for eyes of Liz Taylor violet that would look anything but natural . <p> Before 1945 , artificial eyes were hollow blown glass . After World War II , plastic artificial eyes were created . <p> Nichols makes about 100 eyes a year from heat-cured acrylic plastic , the same material as dentures . Instead of orbs , they are actually concave shells that cup a blind eye or an empty socket . She painstakingly builds them up millimeter by millimeter to custom-fit each eye socket and lift droopy eyelids . <p> The average $ 1,500 cost is covered by insurance . <p> About half her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . The other half were hit by disease : glaucoma , ocular melanoma , retinal detachment . <p> Here are some of their stories . <p> Josh Verbish has been blind in his left eye for 10 of his 16 years , the result of an accident . A childhood tug-of-war over a swimming mask ended when the rubber strap snapped his left eye , causing blindness . <p> He had to baby his eye for years , monitoring the pressure and coping with pain and headaches . He decided to have it removed in 1995 after the iris became a collage of colors and it began to protrude . <p> " I was like , what are we waiting for ? I got sick of it , " Verbish said . <p> Despite losing half his vision , Josh plays forward for the varsity basketball team at Hanover Central High School in Cedar Lake , Ind . <p> His eye problem had a positive effect , he said . " I would never have gotten as good as I am playing basketball , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted . He is tall and lanky , talented on the court , popular with his fellow students . <p> But Josh had an idea . He wanted another artificial eye in addition to his blue one . His mom , Lucy Adam , knew he loved the Nike symbol and suggested it . Nichols " figured out how to do it and she did her magic , " Josh said . <p> " I just thought it would be cool , " he said , as he modeled the startling eye , with black where the white should be and the Nike swoosh in the middle . He looked like a teenage android from a " Terminator " movie . <p> " It 's a lot of intimidation factor on the basketball court , " he added . <p> At a recent game , " No. 24 was guarding me and when I looked up at him he looked at me and he goes "  --  Verbish 's face breaks into a mask of astonishment  --  " I got the ball and he would n't get close to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I scored 12 points . <p> " My coach calls me the one-eyed wonder , " he said . <p> " Whatever makes him happy and feel good , " his mother said . <p> " There 's nothing wrong with having a glass eye , " Verbish said . " I sound like an old grandma , but you can poke your eye out . Trust me . " <p> Susan Staszak , 45 , of Naperville , an administrative assistant at Sears , Roebuck and Co. , had her right eye removed Oct. 6 . <p> She lost vision in the eye because of glaucoma from her radiation treatment for ocular melanoma , a rare form of cancer . The eye became excruciatingly painful and misshapen . She opted to have it surgically removed . <p> Staszak prayed . Hard . <p> Her family and friends tried to encourage her about receiving a prosthesis . Her reaction was typical of many Nichols patients . " What do you mean I 'm going to look good ? I 'm having my eye taken out . " <p> But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet brown of her eyes . " When she gives you an eye and you look in the mirror , it 's like ' Wow . ' . . . When I look in the mirror I do n't think I have a fake eye or a prosthesis . I think I have two eyes because it looks so real and it 's comfortable . " <p> In an advance available only since 1989 , Staszak had an implant inserted into her socket . In six months , she could have a peg inserted into the implant and attached to the artificial eye , to maximize natural-looking movement . <p> Jim Ewart , 51 , of Elk Grove Village , still has his left eye , but it has become shrunken and milky white because of glaucoma , a detached retina and cataracts . <p> He received his prosthesis from Nichols for his daughter 's wedding . <p> " My mother and , of course , my wife both thought it looked wonderful and my brothers could n't tell which eye " was real and which was n't , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test to have my license renewed and I told the examiner , ' I 'm blind in my left eye , ' and he told me ' well , try anyway . ' " I think he took a look at the eye and thought it looked so good , maybe I did n't know that I was n't blind . " <p> He raves about Nichols ' skill . " She sits right here and talks to you and paints it . . . . We 've seen Degas and Monet and all the exhibits in the last few years , but this is very important , too . It 's no less artistic . " <p> Ewart is a joker . He tells people his eye was grown in a deep-freeze lab like the replicant eyes in the movie " Blade Runner . " <p> He always overturns his prosthesis in the cup he stores it in overnight . " You do n't want it to be staring back at you in the morning . " <p> And he sings karaoke : " I Only Have Eye for You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have cried over their loss , sometimes for years . Often they remember the exact date they became blind . They see old movies such as " The Vikings " and study Kirk Douglas ' blind eye with renewed interest . They watch footage of Sammy Davis Jr . and marvel at the advances that have made artificial eyes look so much more lifelike today . <p> Nichols also crafts a hard plastic prosthesis for people who have had their eye and eyelids removed . The prosthesis includes the artificial eye and eyelids and attaches to a patient 's glasses . She even glues on eyelashes and eyebrows and paints skin tones to match . <p> " She is truly an artist , " said nurse Beth Chiappetta , who runs the ocular tumor center at Northwestern University . <p> As Josh 's mother puts it : " There 's always an angel watching you or guiding you somehow , and that 's where June came in.
