The word " prostate " is guaranteed to bring shivers to any male over age 40 . Dr. Ben Dover is the last medical expert middle-aged men want to visit . Prostate exams are unpleasant and demeaning . Worse yet , they remind us forcefully of our age , vivid proof we are n't 20 anymore . But there 's evidence that cycling causes prostate woes  --  even among the non-AARP generations . If you 're a male of any age and riding brings on bouts of increased urination , occasional dribbling , reduction in the force of the stream , and difficulty in voiding , you may be a victim of " prostatitis , " caused by your old friend the bicycle seat . Before you hit panic mode , some facts . All men have a prostate gland . It sits just below the bladder and surrounds the urethra ( the tube that carries urine ) . Although all its functions are n't known , one of its main jobs is producing semen , the fluid that sperm live in . Prostates are usually well behaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their prostate for problems at 40 ) . Then , perhaps due to hormonal changes , the prostate can grow from the size of a walnut to plum-size or even larger . When this happens , it clamps around the urethra and slows the flow of urine . That 's when symptoms such as difficulty in urinating appear . Normally , such unpleasantries are limited to older men and the symptoms are so well chronicled that physicians have no problem diagnosing the culprit . But under certain conditions , cycling can cause prostatitis , an inflammation or irritation of the prostate that mimics the symptoms of age-related problems . H.R. Safford III , M.D. , a Denver urologist and member of Bicycling 's Fitness Advisory Board , explains that " you sit on the prostate when you sit on a bike saddle . When you ride , some weight is borne by the ischial tuberosities sit bones . But perhaps 90 percent rests between the rectum and the scrotum where the prostate is , irritating it . We see guys who go every minutes but have perfectly clear urine . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Road riders typically experience more difficulties than mountain bikers . You 'd think that rough terrain and the resulting pounding from the saddle would worsen the risk . The opposite seems to be true . " On technical terrain , you stand more and move around on the saddle , " says Safford . Even so , it 's possible for some grind-it-out off-roaders to experience problems from the jarring of the saddle against the prostate . However prostatitis arrives , if untreated it may lead to infection and , in a worst case scenario , impotence . Now the good news " Most male riders never have cycling-related prostate problems , " says Safford . They 're protected by their anatomy , choice of saddle design , and riding habits . And even if you experience problems , you can eliminate prostatitis by following these 6 guidelines . ( But always check with your doctor first to rule out more serious problems . ) These tips also help prevent it in the first place . * Avoid narrow saddles . Wide saddles support most of your weight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight models bypass the ischial tuberosities and concentrate your weight on the prostate , almost as if you were straddling a rail fence . Wider saddles , or at least one with a different shape , might solve the problem . Do n't worry about style . Even Miguel Indurain eschews fashion for a comfortable Turbo . In theory , a saddle could be designed to relieve pressure on the prostate . But many riders find the models with holes in the shell ( which relieve pressure ) less than satisfactory . These seats are usually thickly padded , and the padding material can bunch up with use , causing the pressure the design is supposed to eliminate . Two of the best are the Terry TFI Men 's Race ( 315/986-2103 , NY ) and Selle San Marco 's Squadra HDP Olelimpex , 303/282-1880 , CO ) . The Terry is narrow . The HDP , which we reviewed in the August ' 94 New Products , is wider . Some riders swear by leather models such as the old Brooks Pro ( Persons Majestic Manufacturing Co. , 800/722-2453 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Split saddles with 2 hinged sides promise relief , but their design renders them useless for serious riding . Says Safford , " I put a guy on a split seat to race ; But he fell off . " * Check your position . Fit problems are one of the most common causes of prostatitis . For instance , if the top tube/stem combination is too long , riders often compensate by scrunching forward and riding on the tip of the saddle  --  in effect making a wide saddle narrow . Some riders  --  especially those with weak arms and lower back  --  compensate for an overlong reach by tilting the nose of the saddle up . They believe this will keep them from sliding forward . It might , but in this position the saddle again focuses pressure on the prostate . An excessively high saddle can create problems , too . If you have to rock your hips to reach the pedals , your prostate functions like the fulcrum on a teeter-totter . You are massaging the prostate and urethra with every pedal stroke . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotates the pelvis forward and puts the weight directly on the prostate ( or in extreme cases , as far forward as the scrotum ) . In an attempt to emulate the stars , many riders set their bars too low and sit on the tip of the saddle for hours on flat centuries or in the district time trial . " I would n't be surprised if there are n't guys out there with scrotal and perhaps testicular bruising , " says Safford . The solution is to use aero bars cautiously . In most cases , they should be positioned as arm rests to take weight off your hands on long rides . They should n't alter your reach or force you to rotate forward to use them . Even time trialists should beware of extremely low positions that can compromise not only the prostate but also power and efficiency . " It 's good to be aerodynamic , " says Scott Parr , Motorola team mechanic , " but you still have to pedal the bike . " * Vary your riding style . If you grind away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for problems . Get used to standing at the slightest provocation  --  a small rise , a brief gust of wind , a threatening dog by the side of the road . " Prostatitis is less of a problem if you have more blood flow , " says Safford . " It 's constant , steady pressure that leads to trouble . " For example , criterium riders would seem to be especially at risk . But they 're saved a higher incidence of problems because they periodically relieve pressure by sprinting out of the saddle for every corner . In other words , do n't be a lazy rider . Too many cyclists get frozen on the bike . Not only do they stay seated , they do n't move on the saddle . Get used to sliding to the rear when climbing , forward to spin . * Try rear suspension . If you 're one of the rare off-roaders experiencing prostatitis  --  or if you suffer age-related prostate problems but want to continue cycling  --  you might try a full-suspension bike . It will absorb much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rear carbon composite/viscoelastic beam may also provide relief ( Softride , 206/647-7420 , WA ) . * Try a recumbent . Yes , it is a quantum shift for most riders . But a recumbent 's bucket seat will keep you pedaling . Pedaling PSA Prostate cancer is being diagnosed earlier because of a test called PSA , ( prostate specific antigen ) . PSA levels rise when cancer is present , so the test ( even though it 's still controversial ) is usually combined with a rectal exam as a screening tool . The problem for cyclists is that the massaging action of the saddle can stimulate PSA production and cause false positives . At least that was the finding of a report published in the March ' 94 Journal of Urology . Unfortunately , the study involved only one subject  --  a 70-year-old man who rode an exercise bike only 1-2 miles a day . But H.R. Safford , M.D. , is planning a study involving large numbers of cyclists , probably in the ' 95 Denver Post-sponsored Ride the Rockies . " We 'll study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check PSA before , during , and after each day 's ride . Then we 'll group results according to age  --  does a 20-year-old get a 0.2 rise while a 70-year-old experiences an increase of 20 ? " The resulting data will provide information that should help avoid false positives . <p>
