<p> It is so ridiculous that a simple gag gift has now turned into the crime of the century . <p> You ca n't tell me this young man had a problem with a piece of cloth ! What is wrong with his mother ? Has she never seen a cloth penis ? Has she never heard an off-color joke , for goodness ' sake ? <p> Lobbying for what ? <p> I read with great interest your coverage on the state legislator and his novelty sex gag . I 'm sure his constituents will be very understanding when he explains that he had to wear it on the floor of the General Assembly because lobbyists gave it to him . <p> Shoot , I understand . After all , he 's just an elected representative , and the lobbyists , yet again , gave a gift that could n't be refused . <p> The mysterious lobbyist , however , has piqued my curiosity . Who is this person ? Whom does he represent ? Is there a novelty sex gag political action committee that I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join ? <p> KEVIN McGREEVY , Athens <p> Seen it already <p> I can hardly believe what I have read in the past several days about the flap over a 13-year-old seeing a toy penis . <p> I 'm a 75-year-old retired minister and I do not condone what the gentleman at the state Capitol did , but I would guess that many 13-to 15- year-old boys could tell the older man things he never knew before . <p> If the talk of condoms and sex education that is taught in our public schools and on TV has n't already educated these young people on what a male organ is , it would surprise me ! <p> WILLIAM J. PRUETT , Snellville <p> Leave it to voters <p> The Ethics Committee and the GBI investigating sophomoric behavior on the floor of the state Legislature ? Please ! I thought they had more important things to do . Let the voters take care of this at the polls next time . <p> DEBORAH A. LEE , Roswell <p> Definitely not funny <p> I believe that I have a sense of humor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do not find funny . <p> I do not see humor in walking around on the floor of the Georgia Legislature and in the Capitol corridors wearing an apron with a fake penis that pops out at inopportune moments . <p> EMMA LOU HEUSINKVELD , Stone Mountain <p> On to bigger chambers <p> In regard to the " phallus flap " at the State House : I think we should send Rep. Jimmy Benefield to Washington . He could run against Sam Nunn for the United States Senate . This action would be a fitting symbol of what many believe the government has become in the past 12 years . <p> JOHN B. BOWEN Jr. , Atlanta <p> Proud people of Heartland are n't looking for handouts <p> Regarding a recent editorial and letters about the Midwest flooding disaster : The nickname " The Heartland " does not signify geographic location as much as it does the people who live there . Midwesterners give of themselves , they help one another and they go to bed each night knowing that if they got into a jam , a neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it is true , the Midwest is generally conservative when it comes to politics , and those " conservative " people believe that more spending will not help a budget that is out of control . <p> When the grain embargoes of the 1970s crippled the farmers , the rest of the country said , " You 're going to have to tough it out . " When the farm foreclosures of the 1980s devastated the family farm and ended a way of life , the rest of the country said , " Tough ! They had it coming . " Now , in the face of a flood of biblical proportions , we say , " Maybe now is a good time to cut spending , " or better yet , " Even the Egyptians knew not to build on floodplains . " Have n't they had enough ? Have n't they given enough ? <p> It also is true that there are politicians in Washington who have delayed the process of getting federal money to flood victims . But before you start dancing in the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main people that caused that delay . Yes , Iowa ! Why ? Because he is " foolish " enough to ask silly questions like , " Where is the money going to come from ? " and " What is going to get cut from the budget so we can pay for this ? " What a concept ! <p> So while you worry about those stupid , conservative farmers who live in that famous floodplain called the Midwest getting your tax dollars , you should stop and look past the end of your sunburned nose . They do not want your help , unless it comes from the heart . <p> KIM LEWIS , Duluth <p> As a role model , Martina serves nicely <p> It was an inspiration reading the recent article about Martina Navratilova titled " A cause 's champion . " Her message is global . She likes freedom . She is honest , truthful , kind , unselfish , vivacious , nonviolent , does not use drugs or alcohol , and is willing to help people . <p> She is mentally and physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shouldered , on and off the tennis court , in America and abroad , is nonpareil . Few human beings under similar circumstances would have attempted to climb the mountains she has climbed . <p> If young people could only see how focused she is about her career , how she solves problems , and sees life from a wide , broad , healthy , rewarding , caring perspective , they , too , could be successful in their fields of endeavor . What a role model to bring to the city and the state . <p> DOROTHY M. HAITH , Fort Valley <p> The final taboo <p> The recent news article about the biography of Ted Turner states that Mr. Turner considered a bid for the presidency but advisers felt that his taking lithium for manic depression would be a liability . Such an attitude is disheartening . <p> It is this attitude that discourages people from seeking treatment for mental health problems . People forgo treatment for fear of the backlash associated with being a " mental health patient . " <p> Who in this world can daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this nation without experiencing the feelings of hopelessness and despair associated with clinical depression ? Those who have tuned out have a deeper problem . Depression often goes undetected until it is too late . Witness the recent White House suicide . <p> I admire Mr. Turner for dealing with his condition head-on . I encourage others to seek treatment if they or others feel it is necessary . We would not have the degree of homicide and suicide in our country if we would only address this issue . <p> JOY JONES-KEYS , Albany <p> Simple slogans are best <p> A recent editorial about the efforts of the Atlanta marketing committee to develop an Olympic slogan for the city indicates that too much effort is going into explaining abstractions . A symbol should be simple , suggestive rather than explanatory , and provide a basis for easy and colorful visualization . Here are two offerings : <p> " Atlanta : The World 's Choice " and the more colorful " Atlanta : Horizon City . " <p> R.H. LANGMAN , Marietta <p> Word from Cumming <p> With reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come from the store manager and been directed first to the two insulted cashiers and second to the people of Forsyth County for assuming that there is a strong element of racism here . Population growth here does not come from folks running away from blacks . People move here to get away from high taxes and high traffic volume , and to find affordable housing in an expanding economy . <p> We have experienced great civility and common sense from people in this county . These qualities surely could accommodate a diversified community . <p> MARILYN and WILLIAM LEE , Cumming <p> Come on now , let 's be fair . The Winn-Dixie incident , as serious as it is , was caused by a nonresident , a very stupid , unthinking employee of Winn-Dixie . The 50,000 residents of Forsyth County were not involved . On the contrary , they were shocked , honestly shocked . So please do n't blame the entire county population of Forsyth for the actions of one or two arrogant and cowardly employees of Winn-Dixie . <p> TED BORZAK , Cumming <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people do not favor more taxes . Amazing ! <p> Why do polls not ask questions in a more neutral tone ? For instance : " Do you favor increased taxes ? " or " Do you favor increased deficit spending ? " As a college graduate ready to enter the work force , I would be much better served by another 12 years of Reaganomics . I just could not do that to my grandchildren and their generation . <p> ROGER PALMER , Conyers <p> I make less than $ 50,000 per year , far less than the $ 100,000-plus an individual needs to earn in order to be sorely affected by the president 's deficit-reduction plan . Most Americans fall into the same category . So why are so many people allowing media types to whip them into a frenzy over this plan ? <p> Let 's permit those rich enough to pay to finally contribute their fair share to the government . <p> JACKIE JELKS-SIMS , Atlanta
