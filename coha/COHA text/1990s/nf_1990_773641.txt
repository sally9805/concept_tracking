txt // Can this remarkable description be correct ? Can everything in our universe be traced back to one explosive moment ? Some years ago , Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman , two nuclear physicists , pointed out an aspect of the big-bang theory which could be tested experimentally3 According to the theory , the universe came into existence as a droplet of hot , dense matter . This early universe must have been a fireball filled with an intense , brilliant radiation . As the universe expanded , the intensity of the fireball diminished . The calculations of Alpher and Herman indicated that if the big bang really did occur , a remnant of the fireball should exist today , and should be detectable with a sensitive radio antenna . For some reason , no one took the suggestion of Alpher and Herman seriously enough to look for the fireball radiation . It is puzzling that this opportunity to discover how the world began failed to engage the attention of astronomers at the time . Perhaps the reason is that the project was too bold in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years elapsed and then , at the Bell Laboratory in New Jersey , two physicists , Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson , stumbled across the fireball radiation quite by accident . Penzias and Wilson were not looking for proof of the beginning of the world , they were measuring the intensity of radio waves in a large antenna which had been set up for a completely different purpose . Their measurements revealed a puzzling radiation which came to their antenna from all parts of the sky . Penzias and Wilson were unable to explain the source of this radiation until a friend sent them an article that described the theoretical properties of the cosmic fireball . The rest is scientific history . Subsequently , other physicists and astronomers confirmed the existence of the fireball radiation . Their confirmation goes beyond the mere presence of the radiation ; the detailed measurements show that the wavelengths , or colors , present in this radiation exactly match the pattern of wavelengths expected for the flash of light and heat emitted in a great explosion . This // pattern of wavelengths is the fingerprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unmistakable . The measurement of the pattern of the wavelengths in the cosmic radiation convinced nearly all astronomers that the big bang really did occur . No competing explanation for the radiation was provided by the steady-state cosmologists . As a consequence , their theory fell into disrepute . Some doubts regarding the big bang returned a few years ago , when new measurements of the pattern of wavelengths revealed a disagreement with the predicted amount of radiation from an explosion . The discrepancies appeared only at certain wavelengths in the neighborhood of a few hundredths of an inch . However , at these wavelengths the intensity of the cosmic radiation seemed to exceed the theoretical intensity for an explosion by a factor of 100 or more . As a result , faith in the big-bang cosmology was shaken . In 1989 , a NASA satellite specially equipped for the study of the fireball radiation repeated the measurements that seemed to disagree with the big bang . The satellite results were very accurate because they were free of the interfering effects of the earth 's atmosphere and could be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troublesome earlier results were incorrect . The agreement with the properties of a cosmic explosion turned out to be extraordinarily good . The chart on the following page shows the results of the satellite measurements as a series of small open squares , giving the intensity of the cosmic radiation at various wavelengths . The curved line in the chart shows the predicted pattern of radiation that would be produced by an explosion . The agreement is close to perfect . This chart , which confirms a picture of the beginning of the universe with remarkable scientific and philosophical implications , is one of the great triumphs of modern science . The science community gave its formal approval to the big-bang cosmology some years ago , when Penzias and Wilson received the Nobel Prize for discovering the proof of the beginning of the universe . Astronomers are confident in the validity of that finding . What about the prediction of an end ? Must the universe fade into darkness as the stars burn out and the galaxies move apart ? The cosmologists say that this prediction is not necessarily valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outwardmoving galaxies , will slow down the expansion of the universe . If the pull of gravity is sufficiently great , it may even bring the expansion to a halt . For a brief moment , the elements of the universe are at rest , poised momentarily in a balance between the outward momentum of the initial explosion and the inward force of gravity ? But then , always attracted by gravity , they begin to move towards one another , slowly at first and then with increasing speed . // Under the relentless pull of gravity , the galaxies of the universe hurtle together . After a time , they come into contact ; then their materials mix , their elements are heated by compression ; and the universe returns to a condition of searing heat and chaos . And after that ? No one knows what will happen . Some astronomers speculate that the universe will never emerge from this collapsed state , but others say the universe will rebound from the collapse in another big bang . Moving outward , the galaxies will be slowed once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again they will fall inward ... According to this view , the universe must oscillate forever in a never-ending cycle of expansion , contraction and renewed expansion ? birth , death and rebirth . In each cycle , the universe will be melted down and remade in the cauldron of another big bang , out of which there must evolve an entirely new world , in which no trace of the previous universe remains . Is the theory of an oscillating universe correct ? The answer depends on whether the force of gravity , acting on the outward motion of the galaxies , is sufficient to halt their motion . The force of gravity depends , in turn , on how much matter each galaxy contains . The more matter in the galaxies , the stronger is the gravitational force pulling them together . If the amount of matter in each galaxy is sufficiently great , the gravitational attraction of the different galaxies on one another will be strong enough to bring the expansion of the universe to a halt , and reverse it to begin a renewed collapse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each galaxy is not great , the force of gravity will not be sufficient to halt the expansion . The universe will continue to expand indefinitely in to the future , and fade eventually into darkness . ' Do the galaxies contain enough matter to halt the expansion ? Astronomers have added up all the matter they can find ? that is , all the matter present in a visible form as stars in the galaxies ? and they find that this is only about one hundredth the amount needed to bring the expansion of the universe to a halt . // visible matter in the universe is all the matter that exists , the expansion will continue forever . But the discoveries of the last decade have revealed that the contents of the universe include more than the matter we can see . There is also dark matter , which reveals itself only by its influence on the motions of the stars and galaxies . The amount of dark matter in the universe is between 10 and as much as 100 times greater than the amount present in visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much as 100 times the amount of visible matter , we have enough ? but just barely ? to bring the expansion of the universe to a halt . As I write this , the best guess is that the universe contains 30 times more dark matter than visible matter . That means that the universe has about a third of the amount of matter needed to halt the expansion . But as astronomers continue to look for dark matter , they find more and more . Perhaps one day they will find enough to tell us that without question , we live in an oscillating universe . The great theoretical cosmologist , Stephen Hawking , said some time ago , " Twenty years ago you had two percent of the matter needed to halt the expansion . Today we have thirty percent . Why do n't you go out and look again . " There the matter rests for the moment . Astronomers are not sure whether the universe will expand forever , or come to a halt and collapse on itself . Scientists have exposed very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the assemblage of the elements within the stars out of the three basic particles , and their dispersal to space in supernova explosions ; but science has found no satisfactory answer to two of the most profound questions to occupy the mind of man ? the questions of beginning and end . // The origin of the solar system is less of a mystery than the origin of the universe , but it is still not a clearly understood event . When I was in high school I was taught the theory that the planets came into being as by-products of a catastrophic event in which the sun collided with a passing star . The force of gravity tore huge streamers of flaming gas out of the bodies of the two stars during this encounter . As the intruding star receded into the distance , some of these streamers of gaseous material were attracted by the sun 's gravity and captured into orbits circling around it . The earth condensed out of one of these streams of hot gas to form a molten mass , on whose surface a crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is easy to calculate the probability that the solar system originated in this way . The likelihood of a collision between the sun and another star depends on the size of the sun , and on the distance between it and its neighbors . Stars , large though they are , are very small in comparison with the average distances that separate them . The sun , for example , is one million miles in diameter , and 25 trillion miles from its nearest neighbor . For that reason , the chance of a collision between two stars is very small ; a calculation shows , in fact , that only a few collisions could have occurred during the history of the galaxy . Indeed , the planets in 94 // our solar system may be the only ones in existence , according to the collision theory . A very different prediction comes out of the modern theory of the formation of the stars . This theory asserts that planets are formed as a natural accompaniment to the birth of a star . As the gas cloud of the star-to-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density of the gas increases , and atoms and molecules collide and occasionally stick together . Gradually , small fragments of solid matter accumulate in the cloud as a result of these collisions . What happens next is not well understood . According to one theory of the birth of the planets , when the fragments of solid matter are still quite small they are swept along with the surrounding gas in its motion around the center of the cloud . However , when the fragments become large enough ? roughly basketball-sized or larger ? they are too massive to be carried with the gas . They begin to " fall " out of the gas cloud toward the central plain of the cloud of matter around the newly forming star , where the density of the gas is greatest and the pull of gravity is strongest . In the course of time , the basket= ball-sized objects become concentrated in a thin disk of matter rotating around the young star at the center . The situation is analogous to that of a cloud of moist air in which droplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they move with the air currents , but when they have grown to a sufficiently large size , they fall out of the cloud in the form of rain . According to this picture , when our solar system was young it consisted of a relatively dense , hot cloud at the center ? which eventually formed the sun ? surrounded by a large number of solid bodies and planetesimals of various sizes . With the further passage of time , the central cloud continued to contract and grow hotter , until finally its temperature reached the critical level of 20 million degrees needed for the ignition of thermonuclear reactions . This point in the contraction marked the true birth of the sun . That occurred about 4.6 billion years ago . // For millions of years , throughout the period in which the sun was forming , the aggregation of small bodies into larger ones continued until the planets were completely formed . The last stage in the formation of the planets may have occurred somewhat before the sun was born , or later . We are not sure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons in the solar system could have been formed in the same manner , as still smaller condensations around their parent planets . The condensation theory of the origin of the planets implies that planets are formed nearly every time a star is formed . They must , therefore , be very common objects in the universe ; in fact , there must be billions of planets in our galaxy alone . Much of the present discussion regarding the origin of the planets rests on this single prediction . Unfortunately , the prediction can not easily be tested by astronomers , because a planet circling a star in another solar system is too faint an object to be seen directly in the largest telescopes on the earth . But above the atmosphere , images are sharper . Telescopes in orbit , or mounted on the airless moon , can bring the light from a star to a sharp enough focus to reveal the faint image of a planet in a distant solar system . The existence of a planet can also be detected indirectly , by its effect on the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star , it pulls at it , causing a slight wobble in the star 's path through space . This wobble can be detected by its effect on the wavelength of the light emitted by the star . Recently , astronomers have discovered just this change in the wavelength of the light from certain stars that suggests they have one or more planets circling around them . A NASA satellite has also discovered a telltale radiation coming from several nearby stars , that suggests these stars are surrounded by rings of particles of various sizes . Theories on the origin of planets indicate that such a ring of particles is the first step in the creation of an earthlike planet . The latest evidence suggests that on roughly a third of the stars // similar to the sun , planets exist or are in the process of being formed . Astronomers are close to confirming Giordano Bruno 's vision of a universe populated by a vast multitude of sunlike stars and earthlike planets . According to the condensation theory , stars and planets are both formed by the contraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why are stars so different from planets ? The answer is connected with their masses . As the star-cloud , or the planetcloud , contracts , its temperature rises . If the cloud is very massive the temperature reaches the value of 20 million degrees , at which nuclear burning commences , and a star is born , If the cloud is small , the temperature fails to reach the critical level , and the condensed cloud remains an inert body without internal sources of nuclear energy ; that is , it becomes a planet . The smallest cloud of gas that will create a star is approximately one-twentieth the mass of our sun . Jupiter is a very large planet , 318 times more massive than the earth , but still it falls short , by a factor of about 50 , of having the mass needed to form a second star in our solar system . It is possible that some of the clouds of gas which condense in outer space are too small to produce the temperatures needed for nuclear burning and , therefore , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets , because a planet is a body that is bound to a star by gravity and circles in orbit around it . Such relatively cold , planet-sized bodies , free of the gravitational influence of any star , may exist around us in considerable numbers . Since they do not shine by their own light , and are too far away from any star to be visible to us by its reflected light , we have no way of detecting these " free planets " or substeller bodies at present . We may stumble across one of them when our unmanned spacecraft begin to explore the regions lying beyond the limits of the solar system . These thoughts are derived from the condensation theory of the origin of the solar system , for which no definite proof has // been supplied . Nonetheless , the theory is generally accepted because it fits so naturally into the latest ideas on the birth of stars . Yet , in spite of its successes , the condensation theory has failed to give us a clear picture of the events that created our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth than we do about the birth of distant stars . The skies contain old stars , young stars , and some that are just in the process of being born ? all directly available for examination in our telescopes . Through them we have learned the story of the formation of the stars and their evolution into the red giants and the white dwarfs . But the early years of the earth 's history are shrouded in mystery , because volcanic eruptions and erosion by wind and running water have combined to erase the record of the earth 's past . The exploration of the moon has yielded important new information regarding the early history of the planets , but the moon is the same age as the earth and we can never learn what events actually brought it into being ; we can never learn as much as we could if we were to be present at the very moment of a planet 's birth . Perhaps we will discover a planet younger than the earth one day , if ever we are able to leave this solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not in prospect in the foreseeable future . For the present we are doomed to ignorance of the conditions which existed on the earth during its formation and its early years . We do not know the temperature at the surface of the young earth ; the gases which floated in its atmosphere ; and the chemicals which were dissolved in the primitive oceans . These facts are unknown , and perhaps unknowable , and yet they are of great interest , because they are bound up with the question of life 's origin . The earliest traces of living organisms discovered thus far ? residues of bacteria and simple plants ? are found in rocks about 3 billion years old . When these organisms were alive the earth had already existed for more than one billion years . During that period of a billion years life developed // here . What were the conditions under which it arose ? We believe that at the beginning there was only a cloud of gaseous hydrogen , mixed with small amounts of other substances . Out of this cloud grew the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of the earth . It was the parent cloud of us all . At its center existed a dense , hot nucleus which later formed the sun . The outer regions ? cooler and less dense ? gave birth to the planets . Out of what materials were the planets formed ? The bulk of the parent cloud must have been composed of the light gases , hydrogen and helium , because they are the most abundant elements in the universe . Other elements relatively abundant in the universe , although less so than hydrogen and helium , are carbon , nitrogen and oxygen , metals such as iron , magnesium and aluminum , and silicon . These substances must also have been present in relatively great abundance in the parent cloud of the planets . No doubt the remaining eighty-odd elements were also represented , but in smaller amounts . All the familiar chemical compounds of these substances would have formed in the cloud in a relatively short period of time . Hydrogen combines readily with oxygen to form molecules of water vapor ; hydrogen also combines with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines with carbon to form methane , also called marsh gas , which is used extensively today for cooking . Carbon and oxygen combine to form carbon dioxide . Considerable amounts of each of these compounds must have formed in the parent cloud . However , they were probably not present in the form of gases , because of the low temperature ? about 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero ? prevailing in the region of the cloud out of which the earth was formed . At this temperature they congealed into a slushy mixt u re of water , ammonia and methane ice in liquid and solid form , plus solid carbon dioxide ? dry ice . The other elements that were present in abundance ? silicon , aluminum , magnesium and iron ? combined with oxygen to form grains of rocklike materi100 RED GIANTS AND WHITE DWARFS als and metallic oxides . These , then , are the substances out of which the planets condensed : a Neapolitan sherbet of frozen water , ammonia and methane , plus various kinds of rocky substances ? all immersed in a gaseous cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of this mixture of gases and solid matter , the bulk of their mass should have consisted of hydrogen and helium . The two largest planets ? Jupiter and Saturn ? are in fact composed largely of these light gases , and Uranus and Neptune possess smaller but still appreciable amounts , but for some reason the earth and its nearest planetary neighbors lack them . Why they are scarcer on the earth than on Jupiter is a mystery . Some students of the subject say that they were blasted away by the rays of the sun , which was much brighter for a brief period in its youth . Whatever may have caused the departure of hydrogen and helium , it is clear from the scarcity of these gases on the earth , that they had disappeared from the neighborhood of the earth 's orbit to a large extent by the time our planet had started to condense . There remained only particles of rock and iron and small amounts of ice , which circled in orbit around the sun , each a miniature planet in its own right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their circling motion . Some collisions were gentle , and the particles stuck together . In this way , in the course of millions of years , small grains of rock gradually grew into larger ones . Some pieces of rock became large enough to exert a gravitational attraction on their neighbors . These were the nuclei of the modern planets . Once they had grown large enough to attract other particles by their own gravity , they quickly swept up all the materials in the space around them , and developed into full-sized planets in a short time . The complete process of planet formation went on over a period of perhaps 50 million years . proceeding with extreme slowness at first , and then with rapidly increasing momentum in // the final stages . At the end , all the matter of the solar system was gathered into the existing planets , and only a few atoms of gas remained in the space between . This is the situation in the solar system as it exists today . // OF THE PLANETS We estimate that the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , were formed 4.6 billion years ago . Sometime in the first billion years , life appeared on the earth 's surface . Slowly , the fossil record indicates , living organisms climbed the ladder from simple to more advanced forms until ? perhaps a million years ago ? the threshold of intelligence was crossed . Earthbound creatures can never learn how that happened , or what conditions led to the emergence of life , because the record of the earth 's early years has been wiped out . The air and water that make our planet livable have worn down the oldest rocks and washed away their remains into the oceans , while mountain-building activity and volcanic eruptions have churned the surface and flooded it repeatedly with fresh lava , removing the remaining evidence . These natural forces have entirely removed the primitive materials that lay on the earth 's surface when it was first formed . No rocks have ever been found on the earth that are older than 3.8 billion years . We know nothing of what happened on our planet from the time of its formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these oldest rocks were laid down . The critical first billion years or so of the earth 's existence , during which life began , are blank pages in the history of the planet . 104 // But on the moon there are no oceans and atmosphere to destroy the surface and there is relatively little of the mountainbuilding activity that rapidly changes the face of the earth . Over large areas , the materials of the moon 's surface are as well preserved as if they had been in cold storage . The moon offers the best chance of recapturing the lost record of the earth 's past . A casual inspection of photographs of the moon immediately confirms that this small planet has retained the record of early events in its history with exceptional fidelity . The photographs show countless craters , most of which have been produced by t he impact of meteorites raining down on the moon for billions of years . Many craters are circled by ramparts ranging up to 10,000 feet in height . Some of these ramparts must be a billion years old or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have been preserved almost unchanged , with little of the original material worn away . Meteorites have collided with the earth throughout its history , just as they have collided with the moon , and they have produced similar craters ; but all traces of the older craters are gone because on the earth various agents of erosion , of which the most important is running water , move materials from one place to another , leveling the crater walls and filling in the pits and hollows . Only the scars of the most recent collisions , such as the Arizona meteorite crater , formed about 30,000 years ago , are still visible on the earth . Pictures of the moon taken by early NASA spacecraft prov id ed proof that the extent of erosion on the moon has indeed been very small . The photographs showed lunar features as small as a few feet in diameter . The clarity of the spacecraft photographs produced jubilation among astronomers , who had been straining to see through the earth 's atmosphere like drivers peering at the road through a rain-spattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in photographs taken with telescopes on the earth were visible , ranging from a few feet // in diameter up to hundreds of feet . These small craters must have existed on the earth as well , but were wiped out almost immediately by the wearing effect of winds and running water . On the moon , such craters can last for a billion years , and even the shallow footprints of the Apollo astronauts , no more than six inches deep , will still be visible ten million years from now . The moon 's resistance to the ravages of time endows its barren landscape with a unique value . The rocks that litter the moon 's surface probably contain no life ; we know they contain very little gold or silver ; nonetheless , they are scientifically priceless because of the revelations they can offer regarding the early years of the solar system . These expectations regarding the moon 's scientific value were first put forward by Harold Urey . He suggested that the interior of the moon is relatively cold , and very different in that respect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many small pockets of molten rock scattered throughout its interior . When one of these pockets is connected to the surface of the earth by a crack or a duct in the solid crust , volcanic upheavals occur , accompanied by great floods of hot , liquid rock . Throughout the earth 's history , its surface has been made over by these convulsions in the interior , which continually bring up new material that spreads out over the surface as lava and congeals to form fresh rock . The older rocks are buried by the congealed lava . As a consequence , most of the rocks on the earth 's surface are relatively young ? not more than a few hundred million years old . The moon 's surface , on the other hand , has not been flooded with lava for billions of years , according to Urey 's theory of a cold moon . Its oldest rocks have not been buried , and they are lying on the surface , easily accessible to the geologist . Prior to the first lunar landing , many geologists held a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body that through much of its life had had a hot interior , like the interior of the earth . These geologists argued that its surface , like that of the earth , had been covered frequently with floods of molten lava , // which buried the record of its past . According to the " hot-moon " scientists , the moon had little to contribute to our knowledge of the early years of the solar system . Attitudes hardened as the day of the lunar landing approached , but partisans of both viewpoints believed that Apollo 11 would settle the controversy . A feeling of intense excitement gripped us as we awaited the return of the priceless rocks . Finally , the day came on which the first box of rocks was scheduled to be opened . Tension mounted in the viewing room of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory as scientists and reporters watched the Laboratory staff conduct an elaborate ritual devised by suspicious earthlings to protect themselves and their environment from their first contact with an alien planet . There was only a minute probability that the lunar rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenseless . But if these organisms existed , they could have a devastating effect on unprepared terrestrial life , hence elaborate precautions were taken . Hot-moon and cold-moon scientists were present . We knew that weeks or months would pass before the experiments that could determine the ages of the rocks would be completed , but we also knew that the moment of truth was close at hand . The results of the age measurements were revealed at a unique conference of lunar scientists in Houston in 1970 . One hundred and forty-two Apollo 11 research teams presented their reports to more than a thousand colleagues and reporters who had come to Houston from all parts of the world . Working with small amounts of the precious material , averaging no more than a thimbleful , they subjected the rocks to every possible variety of investigations , ranging from absurdly simple operations ? equivalent to kicking a tire ? to complex , delicate laboratory analyses ; they had squeezed the rocks under high pressure , heated them to the melting point , examined them under microscopes with polarized light , bombarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atom by atom . // The conference sessions were dreary , as oversized scientific gatherings usually are . Hundreds of people sat in the darkened hall , numbed by exposure to a rapid succession of graphs and charts . The volume of facts and figures paralyzed the mind , yet an undercurrent of excitement gripped us , for we were witnesses to an historic occasion - the first discussion by earthlings of alien materials brought back from another planet . The highlight of the conference came during the opening session : All the rocks turned out to be billions of years old , and some were 4.5 billion years old ? nearly as old as the solar system . There was rejoicing in the camp of the cold-moon scientists . They had been prepared to make a long , patient search for those rare objects , the oldest rocks in the solar system , and now they found these precious antiquities strewn about on the moon , waiting to be picked up in the very first hit-and-miss collection . They felt like prospectors who , hoping to find a few bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuggets . And there was more . The lunar highlands ? a rough , mountainous no man 's land of jumbled rocks and meteorite craters ? turned out to be almost uniformly very old , dating back to the early years of the solar system . The lunar highlands are the primordial crust of the moon , yielding clues to the appearance of the earth at the beginning of its existence , before the oceans and continents appeared . The rocks from the lunar maria , or seas , on the other hand , were younger ? not as young as typical earth rocks , but younger than the lunar highlands . The lunar maria are the large , relatively dark areas that make up the features of the Man in the moon . According to the measurements of the ages of the rocks from the maria , these rocks were laid down when the moon was already several hundred million years old . A detailed study of the lunar rocks revealed still more about the moon 's history . One important finding was that the moon appears to be entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the astronauts were bone dry ; they contained neither free moisture , nor minerals with water molecules included in their structure . The dryness of the moon was a puzzle . Water was relatively abundant in the cloud of substances out of which the moons and planets condensed . The earth contains a substantial amount of water . Why is the moon so dry ? Many astronomers and geologists believe that the lack of water on the moon has to do with the way it came into existence . According to a widely accepted theory , a body the size of Mars ? essentially an oversized meteorite ? crashed into the earth early in the history of the solar system . The heat of the impact melted much of the earth , as well as the intruder itself . A cloud of hot rock vapor exploded from the scene of the collision , and circled around the earth in an orbiting ring . This cloud , at a temperature of thousands of degrees , lost most of its water and other volatile substances to interplanetary space . Gradually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grains of solid rock cooled further , and over the course of time they collected to form the body of the moon . The materials that came together to make up the body of the moon were completely dry because they had been heated to a very high temperature by the collision between the Mars-sized object and the earth , and all the water originally in them had been driven off to space . The dryness of the moon suggests that life does not exist on that body at the present time , since water is an essential ingredient for life as we know it . Moreover , the measurements of the ages of the lunar rocks , discussed below , indicate that they have been in their present state about three billion years . Therefore , we can be fairly confident that no life has existed on the moon for billions of years . This expectation was confirmed by chemical tests on the lunar rocks . They showed no traces of organic matter , such as would leave been left by biological organisms , and also failed to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living matter , such as amino acids and nucleotides . A detailed study of the rocks by geologists yielded still another important discovery . All the samples collected from the lunar maria turned out to be a kind of dark rock known as basalt . Basalt is a congealed lava , formed when molten rock solidifies at the surface of a planet . The presence of basalt means the lunar maria were once pools of molten rock . This was a very interesting result . But further study of the lunar rocks led to another interesting and puzzling result . The rocks from the highlands were light in color , but their properties suggested that they , too , had solidified from molten rock . The entire surface of the moon had , at one time or another , been molten . What melted the surface of the moon ? Why did the melting produce two different kinds of rocks ? The geologists felt that the secrets of the moon 's history might be concealed in these two findings . First : What melted the moon ? Two possible answers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intense meteorite bombardment at the beginning of its life . This explanation fits in with the currently favored theory on the origin of the solar system , which proposes that all the earthlike planets , and their moons , condensed out of grains and fragments of rock of various sizes . As the moon grew to its final size in the last stages of this birth process , gravity pulled the material around it down on the surface with great force . Each fragment of rock generated some heat as it crashed into the surface . The heat of the collision would be radiated away slowly to space , but if enough impacts occurred in a short period of time , the total accumulation of heat could be sufficient to melt the moon to a considerable depth . The other possible explanation for the melting of the moon depends on the presence of uranium and other radioactive elements in the moon 's interior . These radioactive elements release heat , which can accumulate within the moon until the // temperature reaches the melting point of rock.The Apollo measurements showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other radioactive substances . They could also be a cause of the moon 's melting . However , radioactive elements release their heat very slowly . In fact , calculations show that it may take as much as one billion years of steady radioactive heating to bring the interior of a planet like the moon or the earth to the melting point . If the rocks on the surface of the moon were melted when the moon was about one billion years old , that fact would suggest that radioactive heat was the likely cause of the melting . But , if the rocks were melted when the moon was considerably younger than one billion years , it would be necessary to look to another factor ? presumably meteorite bombardment ? for the explanation . These ideas indicate that the times at which the moon rocks were melted could provide the clue to the cause of their melting . With this remark we come to the third critical Apollo result , which is the measurement of the ages of the moon rocks . The ages of the rocks are measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has elapsed since the moon rocks last existed in a molten state . This is just the information needed to distinguish between the two explanations for the moon 's melting . But nature rarely gives up her secrets without a struggle . W hen the results of the age measurements became available , they yielded the answer that both causes of melting probably had played roles in the moon 's history . The light-colored highland rocks collected during the Apollo missions turned out to be at least 4.4 billion years old , indicating that these rocks had solidilied when the moon had existed for less than 200 million years . That is too short a time for the moon to have been melted by the slow process of internal radioactive heating . Therefore , the materials that make up the highland rocks must have been melted early in the moon 's existence by meteorite bombardment . // But the story of the moon 's melting does not end there , because the dark rocks collected from the lunar maria have younger ages , ranging from 3.1 to 3.9 billion years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ages imply that the materials of the maria began to melt when the moon was about 700 million years old . This interval of time could be long enough to have allowed radioactive heating to melt the rocks in the moon 's interior , creating floods of molten lava on the surface . Accordingly , the geologists concluded that the lunar maria are pools of solidified lava that accumulated in the basins of the original highland crust , as a result of repeated volcanic eruptions and lava flooding , after a lengthy period of radioactive heating . With the aid of the Apollo findings , scientists were able to reconstruct the full life story of the moon . Our satellite was born in the fire of a collision between the earth and a giant intruder . The hot materials cooled and condensed . Finally , this material , by now relatively cold , came together to form the moon . But as the moon grew to final size in this process of aggregation , its surface was bombarded by a vast quantity of meteorites , which rained down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one collision had not chance to cool off before they were heated again by the next collision . The temperature rose as the intense bombardment continued and the heat of the successive impacts accumulated . Eventually , the whole outer layer of the moon melted , and remained molten until the bombardment subsided . As the holocaust ended , the molten outer layer cooled and solidified , and the moon became a geologically quiet planet ? a sphere of solid rock from its center to its surface . By the time the moon was several hundred million years old , the intensity of the bombardment had fallen off considerably from the earliest years , but some meteorite collisions still occurred at a reduced rate . These collisions produced the craters visible today in the highlands . Once in a great while , a meteorite ' of exceptional size hit the moon . These mammoth chunks of // rock , up to 60 miles in diameter , presumably blasted out the basins of the circular maria . Now the second stage in the moon 's history began . As the meteorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , simultaneously the moon began to heat up internally , as a result of the decay of radioactive elements buried far below the surface . When the moon was perhaps 700 million years old , the radioactive heating raised the temperature of parts of the interior to the melting point . Now and then , floods of lava poured across the surface , as molten rock forced its way upward through natural channels provided by fractures in the crust . The impact of a very large meteorite would produce such fractures . There must have been numerous fractures under the sites of the biggest meteorite impacts . This explains how the lunar seas came to be formed ; molten rock rose up in the basins excavated by the impact of giant meteorites , creating the seas as we know them today . The picture of the young moon that emerges is that of a body with a relatively cold interior , but covered with a global ocean of hot , molten rock produced by bombarding meteorites . In the course of many millions of years , as the bombardment died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface layer of molten rock cooled , until the entire moon became solid . But now , gradually , the relatively cold interior of the moon grew warm through radioactive heat until , here and there , pockets of molten rock appeared and broke through the weakest parts of t he surface to form the maria . A final conclusion follows from the fact that the ages of the rocks collected from the lunar maria ranged from 3.9 billion years old for the oldest to 3.1 billion years for the youngest . This 800-million-year spread of ages suggests that the moon experienced an episode of internal melting and volcanism lasting about 800 million years . Apparently , volcanic activity and lava flooding ? signifying a partly molten interior ? began on the moon 3.9 billion years ago , and then subsided about 3 billion // years ago , leaving the moon quiet once more . The last three billion years in the history of the moon have been geologically uneventful . These discoveries resolved in the dispute between the hotmoon and cold-moon scientists . Both were right ; the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the episode of volcanism did not last ; the moon died , volcanically speaking , three billion years ago , and has been dead and cold ever since . All the lava flows on its surface have turned out to be billions of years old , as the cold-moon theorists had said they would be ; but because the moon 's surface changes so little with time , those ancient lava flows look as though they had happened yesterday . This fact misled the hot-moon scientists into believing that the moon had been volcanically active during much of its history . An important question remains unanswered : why did the moon 's internal fires die out three billion years ago , while the earth is still volcanically alive today ? The answer has to do with the size of the moon . Small planets , like small animals , lose their heat to space quickly . The moon melted internally for a period near the beginning of its existence because radioactive elements heated its interior ; then , as radioactive heat passed quickly to the surface , it cooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a larger planet , held in its radioactive heat better , and has remained hot and partly molten down to the present time . Eventually , the earth will also become cold and volcanically inactive , but that probably will not happen for two or three billion years . Fresh surprises surely await the lunar scientists as they prepare to return to the moon at the turn of the century and establish a permanent lunar base . Whatever the new discoveries turn out to be , the Apollo landings have already yielded the most extraordinary result that could have been hoped for . We are now certain the some of the materials on the moon have lain there since the early years of the solar system . There is no longer any doubt that // much of the record of those years , missing on the earth , can be deciphered on the airless moon . The moon is the Rosetta Stone of the planets . // Nine planets circle the sun . Six of these ? Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn ? were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neptune and Pluto ? were discovered in modern times . Mercury is the closest of the nine to the sun . It is a small planet , less than half the size of the earth , and scarcely larger than the moon . It 's rocky , barren surface , alternately baked on the side facing the sun and frozen on the side facing away , is extremely inhospitable to life . The planet is difficult to reach by rocket from the earth , because of its closeness to the sun , and it is unlikely that we will learn more about it than we know for many years to come . Moving outward from the sun beyond Mercury , we come to Venus . Venus is the earth 's closest planetary neighbor . It is also our sister planet , closely similar to the earth in size and weight , and situated at a distance from the sun which is not very different . The surface of Venus is completely covered by clouds , and conditions on the planet have always been an enigma , yet romantic hope has flourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fauna . In 1686 de Fontenelle , in his book , Conversation on the Pluralty of Worlds , described the characteristics he expected to find in the people on Venus : I can tell from here ... What the inhabitants of Venus are like ; 130 // they resemble the Moors of Granada ; a small black people , burned by the sun , full of wit and fire , always in love , arranging festivals , dances and tournaments every day . In fact , Venus should provide an even more agreeable climate for living organisms than the earth . The planet is 70 million miles from the sun , while the distance of the earth is 93 million miles . Because Venus is closer it receives twice the intensity of the sunlight falling on the earth ; and although its heavy cloud cover keeps out some of this solar energy , we can still estimate that on Venus the average temperature at the latitude of London should be a comfortable 80 degrees Fahrenheit , or approximately the same as the balmy temperatures of the islands of the Caribbean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated that the climate of Venus is far from balmy . Measurements of the intensity of the radiation emitted from the planet suggested that the temperature on its surface is 1000 degrees Fahrenheit , which is hot enough to melt lead . It is also hot enough to break apart all the delicate molecules that make up the ingredients of a living cell . No organism remotely resembling terrestrial life could survive in such heat . Yet hope lingered on for the discovery of a green world on Venus . Some astronomers argued that life might be supported at the north and south poles , which should be cooler . Others suggested that bizarre organisms might have developed on Venus ? gas-filled bladders , perhaps , whose buoyancy would cause them to float high in the atmosphere , where the air is considerably cooler than it is near the ground . But in the 1960 's not long after the dawn of the space age , several Russian and American spacecraft journeyed to Venus and carried out measurements that have removed the last trace of doubt regarding the high temperature on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet in several different ways , but their data led to the same conclusion . Venus is indeed hot enough to melt lead , and there is no reasonable chance of finding life on its surface . // The spacecraft revealed other unpleasant facts about Venus . The planet has almost no water , and what little it has exists in the form of superheated steam ; the fleecy , white clouds are droplets of deadly sulphuric acid ; and the atmosphere is an asphyxiating blanket of carbon dioxide , so dense that its pressure would exert a force of ten thousand tons on the human body . No flesh-andblood creature could stand the conditions on Venus . The planet is lifeless today and will remain lifeless in the future ; its hellish surface is beyond our reach . It is surprising that Venus is so much hotter than the earth . Why did two planets , probably formed out of similar materials and situated at comparable distances from the sun , evolve along different paths ? Why is the surface of Venus baked by a searing heat , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life ? The Soviet and American spacecraft carried out measurements which supplied the answers to these questions . According to the spacecraft measurements , the atmosphere of Venus consists primarily of a heavy layer of carbon dioxide , about 60,000 times more than is in the atmosphere of the earth . This dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide acts an an insulating blanket which seals in the planet 's heat and prevents it from escaping to space.The trapped heat raises the surface to a higher temperature than it would have if the planet were a naked , airless body of rock . Gases with the property of absorbing heat from a planet 's surface are called greenhouse gases , and their warming effect is called the greenhouse effect . Carbon dioxide is one greenhouse gas . Water vapor is another ; like carbon dioxide , water vapor partly blocks the flow of heat upward from a planet 's surface and atmosphere , thereby warming the planet . Calculations based on the heat-absorbing property of carbon dioxide show that the temperature of Venus could easily be raised to 1000 degrees as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of carbon dioxide in the Venus atmosphere . // The high temperature on Venus is explained by the abundance of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere . The earth 's temperature is lower because it has far less carbon dioxide than Venus , and thus has a smaller greenhouse effect . However , this answer only leads to another question : Why does Venus have so much more carbon dioxide than the earth ? The two planets , formed originally out of similar materials , should have similar atmospheres . Why are they so different ? To some extent , the answer is connected with the presence of life on the earth . At the present time , much of the carbon dioxide in the earth 's atmosphere is removed by marine plants and animals , which convert it within their bodies to solid substances known as carbonates . Sea shells , for example , are nearly pure calcium carbonate . Today the upper layers of the earth 's crust contain a thick layer of carbonate , formed by the compressed shells of countless marine organisms that died long ago ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carbon dioxide that would otherwise blight our atmosphere , as it blights the atmosphere of our less fortunate neighbor . When the earth was young , life was either absent or scarce , and carbon dioxide could not have been removed in this way . However , the gas still could have been absorbed from the atmosphere of the young earth by other chemical changes , not involving living organisms . In these reactions , atmospheric carbon dioxide combines with rocks to form carbonates , somewhat as oxygen in the atmosphere combines with iron to form rust . But such reactions only take place at an appreciable rate if water is present on the surface of the planet . They do occur on the earth , because its surface is covered by oceans of water . But they can not occur on Venus , which is not only very hot , but also very dry . That answers the question : Why does the Venus atmosphere have an abundance of carbon dioxide . The answer is that Venus has very little water.Yet that answer only leads to another question : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made of similar // materials , should have comparable amounts of water . The water on the earth , if spread uniformly over the surface of the planet , would form a layer about 8000 feet deep . A layer of water approximately the same thickness should also exist on Venus . Because of the high temperature on the Venus surface , the water would be present not in liquid form , but in the form of water vapor , or steam , in the atmosphere . The Soviet spacecraft showed that nearly all this water is missing ; some water is present in the form of steam , but the amount is equivalent to a layer of liquid only one foot thick . The first question is : Why is Venus so hot ? The answer is that it has a large greenhouse effect , produced by a dense blanket of carbon dioxide . The second question is : Why does Venus have so much more carbon dioxide than the earth ? The answer appears to be that water is necessary to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This leads to the final question : Why does Venus lack water ? For the answer to that question , it is necessary to go back to the early years of the solar system when the earth and Venus were young planets . At that time , Venus probably did have water on its surface , comparable to the amount on the surface of the earth . On both planets , the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to carbonates in the planet 's crust could have taken place , removing the carbon dioxide and preventing the greenhouse effect from becoming too large . Venus would still have been hotter than the earth at that early time because it is closer to the sun , and the sun 's rays are twice as intense as they are at the distance of the earth . But on the other hand , the sun was considerably dimmer as a young star that it is today . The two opposing factors would have tended to cancel , leaving conditions on Venus hotter than on the earth , but still tolerable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests , Venus and the earth followed similar paths leading to clement temperaVENUS 135 tures and an agreeable environment for life . If life is a common phenomenon in the universe , it probably arose on Venus , as it did on the earth . But gradually , the sun 's rays brightened . As the sun became hotter , the temperature on Venus rose . After a time , the sun became so hot that the temperature on Venus reached the boiling point of water , and the Venus oceans began to boil away . The ocean of water that had existed on Venus was now a dense blanket of steam in the atmosphere . The boiling of the oceans was a catastrophic development for Venus . With no liquid water on the surface , it was no longer possible for the chemical reactions to take place in which carbon dioxide is converted to carbonates in the rocks of the planet 's crust . The carbon dioxide remained in the atmosphere , creating an enormous greenhouse effect and very high temperatures . The water vapor present as steam in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature increase . Meanwhile , the sun steadily grew hotter , warmer , further worsening the situation . As the temperature on Venus rose , another destructive development occurred ; the increasing temperature caused the rocks on the surface to release some of the carbon dioxide that had previously been stored as carbonates . This carbon dioxide , added to that which was already present , intensified the greenhouse effect . The temperature rose further . This was the runaway greenhouse effect : As the planet became hotter , it released more carbon dioxide ; the additional carbon dioxide made the planet hotter yet , still more carbon dioxide was released , driving the temperature even higher . The curve of temperature growth spiralled upward , until finally the conditions needed for the development of life on Venus were permanently destroyed . If this picture of the history of Venus is correct , it has grim implications for the fate of life on the earth . For the study of many stars similar to the sun reveals that the sun will continue to increase in brightness , and after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will boil away , creating a runaway greenhouse effect on the earth and extinguishing all life on our planet . 11 MARS Mars has generated more speculation regarding extraterrestrial life than any other planet in the solar system . Several properties of the planet have contributed to these speculations . Its surface , nearly free of clouds , reveals changes during the Martian year that resemble the march of the seasons on the earth . In each hemisphere a polar cap grows larger in the fall and winter and diminishes in the spring and summer . Dark regions appear each spring that are suggestive of the seasonal growth of vegetation . Toward the end of the nineteenth century , some observers reported a planetary network of canals presumably engineered by intelligent life . Twentieth-century studies of Mars have failed to confirm the existence of the canals . However , spacecraft observations made in recent years have contributed a great deal of new information that bears directly on the prospects for Martian life . The density of Mars , like that of Venus , is about the same as the density @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for this reason Mars is believed to be composed of rocky materials similar to those on our planet . The atmosphere of Mars is rather thin , perhaps a hundredth as dense as the earth 's atmosphere . On Mars , unlike Venus , only a trace of clouds exists , and the features of the Martian surface are not appreciably obscured by 136 MARS 137 them . Dust storms and haze occasionally are conspicuous , but most of the time the planet is open to photographic surveillance . In spite of the thinness of the Martian air , it is impossible to obtain good photographs of Mars from telescopes on the earth because of the blurring effect of the earth 's atmosphere on rays of light reaching us from it . No features of the surface of Mars can be seen from the earth , no matter how large the telescope in which the planet is viewed unless they are 50 miles or more in diameter . It is impossible to tell from the earth whether Mars has mountains , ocean beds , or any features that might indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been taken by NASA spacecraft as they swept past the planet at long distances . The clearest of the spacecraft photographs revealed features as small as a few feet across . They showed that the surface of Mars is marked by a large number of craters , presumably produced by meteorite collisions . There are relatively fewer craters than on the moon , but far more than on the earth . The spacecraft photographs suggest that Mars stands midway between the moon and the earth as a planetary body , its surface being older and better preserved than the surface of the earth , but not as well preserved as the surface of the moon . Mars also stands midway between the moon and the earth in size and mass . It is approximately twice the diameter of the moon , and one-half the diameter of the earth ; its mass is approximately 10 times the mass of the moon and one-tenth the mass of the earth . These facts lead to a prediction regarding volcanism on Mars . We know from the study of the earth that volcanic eruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planet . The source of the heat is the decay of radioactive elements , which exist in the interior of the earth in small concentrations . The findings from the lunar landings indicate that these radioactive elements also exist in the moon . Presumably they exist in the interior of Mars as well . The heat that the radioactive elements created must have // gradually increased the temperatures in the interiors of the earth and Mars , during the early years of their existence . Volcanic eruptions would have commenced on the two planetary bodies at about the same time , when they were about a billion years old , as a result of the internal heating . According to a widely accepted explanation of the origin of a planet 's atmosphere , these volcanic eruptions must have released the gases that created the atmospheres of these planets . Among these gases was water vapor , which accumulated to form the oceans on their surfaces . If this is the origin of a planet 's atmosphere and it explains why the earth has a fairly dense atmosphere , Mars has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time on the earth and Mars , but it did not last for the same length of time on each because of the differences in their sizes . If a planet is small , the heat generated in its interior has to travel only a short distance to reach the surface . Thus , the heat escapes quickly , and volcanism terminates at an early stage in the planet 's life . This appears to have been the case for the moon , whose episode of volcanism lasted only about one billion years . If volcanoes bring water to a planet 's surface , the moon could have had an atmosphere and oceans during its brief period of volcanic activity . After its volcanoes became extinct , the air and water molecules would have leaked away to space . But unfortunately for this interesting conjecture , the moon appears to have been made of completely dry materials from the start . If a planet is large , its internal heat must travel through a thicker layer of rock to reach the surface . The layer of rock acts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the temperature in the interior to remain at a high level for a relatively long time . This is the case for the earth , which has been volcanically active throughout most of its lifetime , and is still active today . That explains the fact that the earth has a great deal of air and water . Since Mars is intermediate in size between the moon and the earth , it must have retained its radioactive heat longer than the MARS 139 moon , but not as long as the earth . Therefore Mars should have been volcanically active for longer than a billion years , but may not still be volcanically active today . If volcanoes did persist on Mars for more than a billion years , the surface of Mars must have once been covered by water to a considerable depth . A substantial atmosphere also existed on Mars during this long period of volcanic activity . These circumstances would have created agreeable conditions for the evolution of life . The prediction that Mars had volcanoes was confirmed in 1976 , when television cameras on the Viking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacecraft first reached Mars , the planet was obscured by a violent dust storm that lasted for nearly two months . Eventually the dust settled , and the cameras revealed details of the surface of Mars that had never before been seen by man . The most conspicuous feature in the photographs was a huge volcanic mountain , later named Mount Olympus . This mammoth volcano is fifteen miles high and three hundred miles across at its base . In every respect Mount Olympus resembles the mounds of congealed lava that form on the earth when successive outpourings of molten rock occur at a single spot over a period of millions of years . If the Pacific Ocean basin could be emptied , the Hawaiian Islands would be revealed as similar but smaller mounds of lava , rising out of the floor of the ocean in the same way that the Mars mountain rises out of the surrounding terrain . About a dozen large volcanic mountains like Mount Olympus have been discovered on Mars . There is evidence that all are extinct , and have been for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been obliterated if fresh floods of lava had run down the sides of the mountains in recent years . From the number of craters present , it is estimated that the Martian volcanoes died out about half a billion years ago , after about three billion years of volcanism . This fact agrees with the prediction that Mars should have been volcanically // active longer than the moon , but not as long as the earth . The existence of volcanoes on Mars suggests that water was plentiful on Mars at one time . The spacecraft photographs also confirm this prediction . They reveal dry channels that look like arroyos and riverbeds carved by flash floods that occurred millions of years ago . Nothing except the flow of enormous volumes of water could have produced those channels . Furthermore , the north and south poles of Mars are covered by thick caps of ice that show signs of having been partly melted and refrozen several times in the past . The implication is that Mars has experienced a succession of ice ages alternating with times of warmth and moisture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has also been warmer . No developments more encouraging for the prospect of Martian life could be imagined . If life gained a toehold on Mars during those warm , wet intervals , it might have adapted by degrees to the harsh conditions that befell the planet later on . The transition to the drier climate of today could have occurred very slowly , over a period of millions of years and a like number of generations . During this long period of slowly increasing aridity , the weakest individuals in each generation would be eliminated , and the hardiest would remain , propagating their qualities of strength to their descendants . There seems no reason to doubt that varied and interesting forms could exist on Mars today as a result of this long-continued process of natural selection , if the planet once had an abundance of water . Of course , Martian life would be simple and perhaps no higher than the level of a microbe ; there are surely no intelligent Martians , because all evolutionary progress on Mars must have been slowed down hundreds of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its water supply diminished . The search for life on Mars was planned with this last fact in mind . The Viking spacecraft contained three experiments that should have worked if any kind of living organism existed in the
