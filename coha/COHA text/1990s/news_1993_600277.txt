<p> Dorothy Gassan watches with dread as her husband Eddie slips further into Alzheimer 's disease . <p> " He burns up all our pots and pans , he forgets everything . I know what 's facing us in the future , and I 'm so frightened , " says Gassan , 79 , as she eats a sloppy Joe in the cafeteria of the Washoe County Senior Center . Her husband , 89 , a former casino supervisor , is shooting pool in an adjacent room . <p> Gassan 's greatest fear is n't her husband 's fading memory . It 's how she 'll be able to afford care for him as the disease steals his independence and dignity . They already pay $ 329 a month for insurance to supplement Medicare . <p> " But that does n't cover everything , " she says . " If he needs a nursing home someday , we 'd be wiped out in six months . Then they take your house , your car , everything . " <p> The reforms President Clinton promises to deliver in mid-June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits it ca n't afford $ 50 billion more every year to guarantee everyone long-term coverage , even though polling shows it 's among the public 's top health-care worries . <p> Clinton officials realize " we can not completely solve it this year , next year or the year after . It is too expensive a problem , " says Ira Magaziner , director of the White House health-care reform task force . <p> Clinton 's plan is likely to include : <p> A prescription drug benefit plan , so far not detailed . <p> Coverage of some home- and community-based services . <p> Relaxation of rules that now require people to deplete their savings and property before Medicaid picks up nursing home bills . <p> Here in Nevada - the state with the fastest-growing population over age 65 - and across the nation , worry is growing that health reform may overlook many who need it most . <p> " I do n't sleep at night thinking about what Clinton could do for people like us . I just hope he does it soon , " says Gassan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tug-of-war between budgetary realities and wrenching personal needs . <p> If Clinton 's plan falls short of what politically potent senior citizens ' groups want , they might be able to derail the entire health revolution . <p> Already , the American Association of Retired Persons is asking its 33 million members to deluge the White House with letters demanding that long-term care be part of Clinton 's health reform package . <p> " We do n't think a health proposal will be true reform until long-term care is included , " says Karen Kedrowski of Families USA , a health-care advocacy group . <p> More than 10 million in the USA need long-term assistance with medical care or daily living . Two-thirds are elderly , the rest disabled . <p> Their needs are unrelenting , and money to pay for them is scarce : Nationally , half of all nursing home care is paid for by individuals , not insurance or government programs . <p> A year in a nursing home can easily top $ 30,000 . The $ 50-$ 200 daily cost of at-home care can empty a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal-state program , finances long-term care for low-income people . Yearly taxpayer price tag : $ 35 billion . <p> Medicare covers 32 million elderly people and 3.6 million disabled workers . The federal program for senior citizens now costs more than $ 140 billion a year - 15% of the nation 's health spending . <p> The demand for long-term care is only going to grow as the Baby Boom generation ages . By 2030 , there will be about 66 million senior citizens - more than twice the number in 1990 . <p> Almost every family will be touched by the crisis : One of every 3 people in the USA will one day enter a nursing home . <p> Janet Johnson , 71 , a Reno nurse , knows what it 's like to watch nest eggs vanish when an elderly relative becomes ill . <p> Her 97-year-old mother died two weeks ago after years of in-home care and retirement homes . Even with a decent pension , her mother could n't afford a nursing home . <p> " They 're $ 100 a day . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take care of her so we could get by , " says Johnson . <p> " It 's a crushing burden , a crushing expense . The Clinton administration has to look deep into the situation and realize the horrible predicament elderly Americans are in . Paying for prescriptions is nice , but it 's just a drop in the bucket , " she says . <p> Charlotte and Bill Pruiett understand Johnson 's anguish and anger . To pay for her parents ' care , they borrowed against their house so often that eventually it was of no value . <p> " We had to get rid of it . We lost everything . Is this really what America is all about ? " says Bill Pruiett , 73 . " Is this what we have to look forward to for ourselves ? " <p> Over the long haul , many argue , the only way to pare taxpayer spending on health care is to address the needs of the elderly and disabled . <p> " If you leave it out , " warns Deborah Briceland-Betts , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it will simply add unnecessary costs to the acute care system : avoidable hospitalizations and emergency room visits . " <p> Adelhied Norris , 88 , a native of Copenhagen , sometimes spends hours a day in her wheelchair in her small nursing home room thinking about health-care reform . She says higher taxes make sense . <p> " In Denmark , you do n't have to worry . Sure , you pay big taxes , but in the long run it 's cheaper and you do n't get worry lines , " says Norris , who lives at the Sierra Health Care Center in Sparks , Nev . <p> Harder to quantify is the human toll on family members who care at home for relatives - day after day of emotionally , physically and financially draining work . <p> " Families want to keep people at home , " says Kedrowski . <p> " You would not need to spend a whole lot of money in order to provide people some valuable help - home- and community-based care . Families are willing to pitch in ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grocery store , have a night out once in awhile . " <p> Dr. Stephen McConnell of the Alzheimer 's Association says , " Because three-quarters of the care for Alzheimer 's and other long-term care needs is provided by family care givers , they really need something to support them . <p> " There 's no question that these problems are only going to get worse . It does n't make sense for reforms to cover the costs of heart-bypass surgery but not the care of Alzheimer 's victims . " <p> Until the issue is resolved , says Reno retiree Harry Clemons , 75 , his elderly friends will continue having to decide between buying prescription drugs or buying food . <p> " These are decisions no one on Earth should have to make , especially the elderly , " he says . " We 've got a Rube Goldberg-type health care system . There 's so much red tape you could get tangled and die before you get out . It 's an archaic , ridiculous system that needs so much revamping I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campeau , 75 , say the answer is to fight to stay in shape and stay out of the medical system . <p> He volunteers to lift heavy objects every day at the Washoe County Senior Center , walks many miles a week and does isometric exercises . He hopes he 'll never have to deal with nursing homes or in-home care . <p> " You can be an honest John and work hard all your life . Then you get older and get sick and some jerk takes it all away from you . It 's like bam ! Your life is suddenly in someone else 's pocket , " says Campeau . <p> " If I ever get that sick , I think I 'll make me a little trip to see that suicide doctor from Michigan . Anything 's better than being old and very sick in this country right now . "
