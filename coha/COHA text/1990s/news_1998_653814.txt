<p> It is hard for most people , even those who know him , to comprehend the magnitude of Halsey Minor 's ambition . <p> But Thomas S. Rogers , the president of NBC 's cable and Internet division , got to witness Mr. Minor in the full flush of confidence last Wednesday at Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan  --  a victory lunch to celebrate NBC 's acquisition of a controlling stake in Snap , the Internet directory and guide service created by Mr. Minor 's company , Cnet . <p> After Mr. Rogers asked Mr. Minor to write his prediction for Cnet 's stock price a year from now on a slip of paper , a half-dozen NBC executives around the table jotted down their own guesses of what he had written . Knowing the 33-year-old Cnet founder 's lofty regard for his new-media vision , each picked a figure far above the $48 that Cnet shares were trading at that day  --  a number that was already a 45 percent jump from Monday , the day before the NBC deal was announced . <p> Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure much higher than anyone had dared guess . ( The price ? No one would comment for publication , but more on that later . ) <p> Mr. Rogers was surprised by the apparent hubris , he recalled later , for even the most ambitious executives at General Electric , NBC 's parent , cloak their aspirations behind at least some false modesty . And in Silicon Valley , near Cnet 's headquarters in San Francisco , executives typically sit in torn jeans and talk about how their technology is improving society . ( It is only on the sly that they peek at the up-to-the-minute value of their stock options . ) <p> But Halsey Minor has always made his aspirations clear : He 's not out to save the world ; he 's going to conquer it . With a preppy appearance masking a pit bull intensity , Mr. Minor is not embarrassed to proclaim his intention to become the first media mogul of the Internet , the Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch of his generation . <p> Depending on one 's viewpoint , Mr. Minor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egotistic upstart . Whatever the angle , NBC decided to endorse Mr. Minor 's strategic direction . <p> " This is the sign of a guy with a true vision , someone who does n't mess around and mince words , " Mr. Rogers said . " He is very creative , but he 's also a businessman with two feet on the ground . " <p> In last week 's $63 million deal , NBC agreed to acquire up to 60 percent of Snap 's technically elegant but money-losing service and to promote it on the air to the 73 million people who watch its programs each week . <p> NBC 's seal of approval does not guarantee Mr. Minor 's success , of course . But the deal , and other recent evidence that his ideas may be catching on , does at least validate a new-media approach that until now has flouted conventional wisdom . <p> His first Internet services , a series of Web sites about computers that started in mid-1995 , gambled that money could be made producing new information for the Internet . Mr. Minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen out of fashion because it is expensive . Most of the successful content sites , like CNN.com and Time Inc. ' s Pathfinder , so far largely reprint information created for other media or showcase content created by users , as in chat rooms . <p> Then , in an even more controversial move , Mr. Minor diverted 150 people at a cost of $25 million to develop Snap , which was introduced last fall , three years after the introduction of Yahoo , Excite and other competing Web guide sites . So far , its ratings have been minuscule . <p> But Mr. Minor was proved right that Internet guide services would be popular with users and more so with advertisers looking to find people interested in their wares . And he predicted that big media companies would decide that these sites , now known as portals , would be the centerpieces of their Internet strategy . <p> Indeed , before he reached the deal with NBC , which thinks its prime-time promotion can make Snap a top-rated portal , Mr. Minor was close to selling an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One interested buyer late last year was Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation . Early this year , he was also close to a deal with the New Century Network , a consortium of newspapers that is now defunct . <p> Things are also looking brighter for the computer Web sites as well . With far less information than its archrival , the computer publishing colossus Ziff-Davis , Cnet 's bright , easy-to-use sites have remained the ratings leaders in their category . Its News.com service has become Silicon Valley 's leading source of up-to-the-minute information about the technology business . And because people who read about computers tend to buy them , advertisers have been drawn to Cnet 's sites , too . <p> Ziff-Davis , fresh from a public stock offering , is trying hard to overtake Cnet on line . And it is beginning a 24-hour television network about computers , which would compete with Cnet 's five weekly television shows that appear on some broadcast and cable outlets . Still , with the financial drag of Snap lifted , analysts expect Cnet to become profitable this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were hurt because the market did n't see us as having a chance of surviving , " Mr. Minor said last week . " But I believe in the end our strategy has been vindicated . " <p> Investors simply have not understood Mr. Minor 's long-term prospects , said Brian C. Oakes , an analyst with Lehman Brothers . <p> " The market is very short-term oriented , " he said . " Building media brands takes years . " <p> For now , Mr. Minor and a newly hired team of experienced media executives will try to give Wall Street the profits it is demanding . Earlier this year , budgets and sales goals were imposed on Cnet 's young staff for the first time . <p> But ultimately , Mr. Minor says , the history of the most successful media tycoons is filled with bet-the-ranch deals and Hail Mary passes , not by fastidious attention to quarterly earnings . <p> " Ted Turner never made money , yet he sold his company for $15 billion , " Mr. Minor said , somewhat oversimplifying the facts . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stock worth $7.5 billion when the deal was announced in 1995 . ) <p> Mr. Minor was intent on becoming a media baron even before he founded Cnet in 1992 . While an undergraduate at the University of Virginia in the late 1980 's , he installed four computers in public places to let people search for rental apartments . Later , Mr. Minor , along with Jeff Bezos , then both investment banking trainees at Merrill Lynch in New York , almost persuaded the brokerage firm to back them in a venture to deliver news electronically to executives . In a cost-cutting move , Merrill killed the project . ( Mr. Bezos would go on to start Amazon.com , the on-line bookstore . ) <p> Mr. Minor was crushed . <p> " He was hopeless . He was like a colt in the stable waiting for the gate to open for a big race , " recalled Russell S. Reynolds Jr. , the well-known head hunter , who interviewed Mr. Minor for a position as his executive assistant a few months after he left Merrill . Looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reynolds offered this deal : If Mr. Minor worked for two years , Mr. Reynolds would help him develop a plan for a new business . <p> The ideas were flowing from the start . <p> " One day he came in with a stack of PC magazines , $279 worth , that was three feet tall , " Mr. Reynolds said . " Halsey said , ' Get it : People are spending money on this stuff . ' " <p> But after his two indentured years , and despite introductions from Mr. Reynolds , Mr. Minor 's plan for Cnet was rejected by most of the leading venture capitalists . Only after a year of living off money from friends and credit cards did Mr. Minor attract $5 million from Paul Allen , the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft . <p> Suddenly , Cnet was in business , with an ill-formed plan to start a cable network about computers and do something on line as well . Mr. Minor set up a studio in some unused squash courts in a health club in the North Shore district of San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In April 1995 , Cnet began a half-hour weekly program on the USA Network cable channel . <p> In June of that same year , the company began Cnet.com , its first Web site , a sort of electronic computer magazine with product reviews , news and helpful tips . ( Today , Cnet 's four weekly television shows operate at a break-even level and are meant mainly to promote its Web sites . ) <p> It was a heady time as Mr. Minor began to hire a handful of experienced computer journalists and armies of eager young workers , all excited by the promise of inventing a new medium . <p> " There is nothing sexier than a C.E.O . who has a passion for his product , " said Christopher Barr , a top editor of PC World magazine who quit to join Cnet in March 1995 . <p> Mr. Minor obsessively surfed Cnet 's sites and those of its competitors , looking for flaws and opportunities . As developers worked , they would talk of the " H-factor "  --  the likelihood that Mr. Minor would bawl them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncanny ability to find anything that is broken , " Mr. Minor said . " I would say to the programmers , ' If you ca n't do it , I 'll write it myself . ' I 'm no expert , but I can make a credible threat . " <p> Some of the threats , accompanied by notorious temper tantrums , have been too credible . And several senior editors , along with a raft of junior staff members , have left Cnet in recent months . <p> Yet it was his decision in 1996 to slow Cnet 's momentum by building Snap that drew the most criticism to Mr. Minor inside and outside the company . People said he was simply too late . But Mr. Minor believed the game was only beginning . <p> " When I was in college , I read a lot about Michael Dell , " he said . " I felt it was too bad I was n't as smart as he was and the PC game was already over . But at the same time I was going through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still , Mr. Minor found only limited success in his initial strategy  --  offering Snap as a home page to Internet service providers so that they could appear to offer their customers as much content as America Online . <p> The on-line service Prodigy , for example , ultimately chose a deal with Excite rather than Snap , even though Prodigy 's chief executive , Russell I. Pillar , is another friend from Mr. Minor 's stint at Merrill . <p> " My ears still ring , " Mr. Pillar said of the conversation in which he told Mr. Minor he had decided to link Prodigy to Excite rather than Snap . " Halsey likes to win at all costs . " <p> And indeed , in order to get the deal done with NBC , Mr. Minor had to confront the true cost of success . Initially , he did not want to give up more than half the ownership in Snap . But NBC would not do the deal if it could not own at least 60 percent , and Mr. Minor conceded . <p> " Ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50 percent of No. 3 , " Mr. Minor said . NBC has the option to buy the 60 percent stake for $39 million . It has also bought 4.99 percent of Cnet 's stock for $26 million . Most important , NBC will provide extensive on-air promotion of Snap . Mr. Minor says the value of that air time will be far higher than the $100 million over three years that CBS traded for a stake in the Sportsline Web site . <p> So what was the stock price prediction that Mr. Minor wrote on that piece of paper ? Neither he nor Mr. Rogers will say , citing laws against promoting stocks . <p> But Mr. Minor is happy to explain his thinking . <p> " Yahoo is worth $5 billion , " he said . " With NBC 's backing , we can get as big as Yahoo within five years , so our 40 percent turns into $2 billion . " <p> And beyond that point , it is hard to comprehend the magnitude of Halsey Minor 's ambition . <p> Chart : " A New-Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have foreseen that he would build it into a new-media company with a stock market value of $665 million .
