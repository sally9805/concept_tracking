<p> THE TELEVISION NETWORKS MAY BE huge corporations . They may be bought and sold by other huge corporations . They may now occupy only a small fraction of available channel space in the growing universe of entertainment programming . But in the minds of the viewing public , they all have distinct identities , and they shed those identities at their own risk . <p> Last fall , three of the four networks , it seems , were trying to be something they are not and never have been . For the most part , in their prime-time shows , the three were trying to be urban-hip NBC . Not surprising , none were as successful as NBC in that guise , as A. C. Nielsen pointed out quite clearly . <p> " I think we do have to get back to our roots " is the way Ted Harbert , the president of ABC Entertainment , puts it . Other network philosophers go with other aphorisms , including the time-honored " You 've got to dance with who brung ya . " <p> From her position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks as an executive vice president for Zenith Media , said : " Expectations are important . Viewers may well bring a certain expectation to an ABC sitcom that you 're going to get a family-oriented show that kids can watch safely . When you do n't deliver on that , you disappoint expectations that have to do with your brand identity . " <p> With those concerns in mind , the networks that struggled in the fall have made some midseason changes that they hope will bring back disaffected viewers . A few of the changes , like CBS 's return to shows that appeal to older viewers  --  " Due South , " for example  --  are already in place . Others , like ABC 's introduction of a promising family-oriented prime-time series featuring the Muppets , will be delayed until the end of the February sweep period , when all television markets will be measured so that advertising rates can be set for the next quarter . The sweep period , which will be filled as usual with mini-series , movies and specials , starts on Thursday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more like NBC earlier this season had as much to do with financial crisis as it did with identity crisis . The audience profile for NBC  --  the network most closely linked to urban young adults , with highly rated shows like " Seinfeld , " " Frasier " and " E.R. "  --  exactly fits the one preferred by most advertisers . As Mr. Harbert succinctly put it , " My sales department wants shows that appeal to adults . " <p> Unfortunately for ABC , it has a well-earned reputation for shows that appeal to children as well as adults . " Full House "  --  populated by five children , infants to teen-agers  --  was a smash hit and a signature show for the network for seven years until it was canceled last spring . And ABC still has the premier family show in " Home Improvement . " But in the last year or so , thanks to those advertiser preferences , ABC 's traditional programming preference became something of an economic liability , so it shifted to more adult-oriented shows like " Ellen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some ABC shows that have children , like " Roseanne " and " Grace Under Fire , " have been considered adult in content . In the fall , ABC moved " Roseanne " and " Ellen " up to 8 P.M. to try to pull adult viewers away from NBC . ) <p> FOX STUNNED THE TELEVIsion world by coming onto the scene in 1986 and quickly establishing itself as a viable fourth network . For its first seven or eight years , it relied on viewers under 25 and rode to success on shows like " The Simpsons " and " Beverly Hills 90210 . " More recently , looking to be a full-fledged prime-time player , Fox decided to expand its identity to include more grown-up viewers . This season , it tried some decidedly NBC-ish comedies like " Partners . " That show was even created by two former writers from the NBC hit " Friends . " But selling the " Friends " style to the Fox audience has been tough . <p> Certainly CBS agrees that no network paid more of a price than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The show that CBS made the centerpiece of what it called its " all new ! " identity in September was " Central Park West , " a glitzy prime-time soap opera about beautiful young people in Manhattan . That show was created by Darren Star , the writer and producer who had brought to television the biggest contemporary hit in the genre , " Melrose Place . " But he had happened to bring " Melrose Place " to Fox , which is where most industry analysts believe that it belongs . <p> And many of CBS 's other new shows  --  like " Ca n't Hurry Love , " " If Not for You " and " Almost Perfect "  --  were clones of the NBC-style comedy . " We tried to be slick and hip , and we made a bad mistake , " said a badly burned Leslie Moonves , the president of CBS Entertainment . <p> Mr. Moonves came to CBS last year with a unique perspective . For much of the previous decade he had been on the other side of the business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers Television . " We always thought of shows and how they fit the profile of the different networks , " Mr. Moonves said . <p> CBS , in Mr. Moonves 's analysis , " stands for the traditional , the classy . " CBS 's competitors have a more brutal interpretation , calling it " the network of the elderly . " CBS had certainly reinforced that reputation in recent years by relying on shows with stars well over 60 , like " Murder She Wrote " and " Diagnosis : Murder . " <p> The network has also long been associated with shows with more rural settings , partly a reflection of its strength in the South . For many longtime television analysts , like Ms. Frank , " The Andy Griffith Show , " a blockbuster from the 1960 's that celebrated the quirks of life in a small North Carolina town , is the prototypical CBS hit . But maintaining the " rural " label for CBS makes little sense given the network 's success in the 1970 's . In that decade , CBS led television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhoda , " sophisticated urban comedies from the MTM Company that would surely be thought of as NBC-ish shows were they on today . <p> At the same time , NBC 's identity as " the ' Seinfeld ' network , with shows that are hip , slick , contemporary , urban , New York-style comedies , " as Mr. Moonves describes the Hollywood production studios ' definition of the network , does not reach back too many years . In truth , it began in the early 1980 's during Grant Tinker 's tenure as chairman of NBC . Mr. Tinker is the person who put the MTM mark on CBS in the 70 's . Then he transferred it to NBC with " Cheers , " a show that ran from 1982 to 1993 and more than any other cemented the definition of NBC as the network of smart comedy . <p> The influence of " Cheers " continues . As it ended , the show gave NBC the lead character for one of its current hits , " Frasier , " and it bequeathed its Thursday night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that show to become NBC 's signature hit . <p> While CBS 's and NBC 's identities have shifted slightly over the years , ABC has been the network with the most consistent identity  --  not counting the far younger and more purely defined Fox . ABC essentially invented the notion that advertisers should try to reach younger viewers because in the late 1960 's that was all it had . The strategy worked to keep ABC alive when it was not competitive with CBS and NBC over all : it was able to tell advertisers that it had lots of people watching shows like " Batman . " <p> In the 1970 's , as CBS 's urban adult comedies started to fade , ABC emerged briefly as the prime-time leader when its youth-oriented shows like " Happy Days " and " Laverne and Shirley " became megahits . But ABC never led the other networks for long in overall household ratings because it stuck doggedly to its strategy to look for children first , confident that younger adults , and the big advertising revenues that went with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strategy that only in the last year did ABC begin to question it . Mr. Harbert says NBC , relying on the increasing number of homes with more than one television set , began to divide and conquer , by putting an adult show like " Wings " up against ABC 's " Full House , " for example . In September , ABC reacted by junking " Full House " and other shows with children in their casts like " Sister , Sister " and " Man of the House " and moving " Roseanne " and " Ellen " to the earlier time slot . <p> The result of all this identity switching has been considerable dissatisfaction for the networks that had a touch of NBC-envy . " Some ugly things have happened this season , " Ms. Frank said . " I think the networks suffered because business needs have gotten in the way of the end user . Whenever I see the networks blame the advertisers , I think the networks are losing a sense of who the end user is . It 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely with that in mind , the programmers have done some soul-searching as they make their midseason adjustments and their plans for next fall . With that search has come the recognition that in a television world where MTV stands for music videos , Discovery stands for documentaries and CNN stands for news , CBS and ABC have to stand for something too . <p> " I think we have to have traditional shows , " said Mr. Moonves of CBS . " I think we need shows with heart . " That lesson is clear from the recent success CBS has had on Saturday nights with " Touched by an Angel , " a drama about angelic intervention . ( " That 's a real CBS show , " Mr. Moonves said . ) <p> Similarly , CBS has made moves in the last two months to replace its failing " hip , slick " efforts with traditional shows . " Due South , " a detective show with two fortyish male stars , and " Diagnosis : Murder , " which brings back Dick Van Dyke , 70 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on Friday night . And the network 's big hope for next fall is " One Foot in the Grave , " a new comedy with Bill Cosby , who was an NBC star in the 80 's as a kindly father but who will be a CBS star as a curmudgeonly grandfather . <p> " What we learned is we have to grab our core viewers first and then expand into the younger viewers , " Mr. Moonves said . <p> Mr. Harbert will be playing more to ABC 's traditions this spring with " The Muppet Show , " perhaps the ideal family vehicle , and " An Alien in the Family , " which has a family of extraterrestrials at the center . " The humor in both shows is quite silly and broad , " Mr. Harbert said , characterizing a formula he believes can hit ABC 's target audience . <p> " Doing a family show that appeals to adults too is about the hardest thing to do on television , " he added . And it 's a task made more difficult by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and critical praise . " The writers would all rather write those shows because then they 're writing about themselves , " Mr. Harbert said . But ABC has rarely had a hit with that kind of show . It simply does better when it develops the kind of shows that have worked for it in the past , like " Home Improvement . " <p> FOX EXECUTIVES STILL SEEM intent on expanding their audience base to add viewers who can remember the Carter Administration . " We 're sticking to the plan , " says John Matoian , the president of Fox Entertainment . But Fox is adding several new shows this spring that seem to fit its original profile , like " The Last Frontier , " a broad comedy that concerns a young woman trying to coexist with young men working on the pipeline in Alaska , and an untitled comedy from the writer John Bowman that will deal with a white writer on an all-black sketch series ( as Mr. Bowman himself was , with Fox 's " In Living Color " ) . <p> Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Yes , the programmers say , but only if it does so selectively , and only if the shows that break the mold do so with style . <p> " A show like ' E.R. ' will work anywhere , " Mr. Moonves said . " Quality supersedes everything . " <p> Drawing .
