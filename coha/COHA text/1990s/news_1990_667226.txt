<p> The sentencing of junk-bond king Michael Milken on Wednesday to a stunning 10 years in prison for stock market fraud and manipulation capped a five-year crackdown on Wall Street crime . <p> So is Wall Street cleaner for the effort ? Did the jailings of top financiers , the millions of man-hours spent uncovering and prosecuting their crimes , the billions exacted in fines and restitution - purge the deceit and dishonesty that former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said for years was systemic throughout Wall Street ? <p> " It definitely changed the atmosphere , " says Giuliani , who helped launch the crackdown in early 1986 and is now a private lawyer in New York . " Questions that were n't being asked six or seven years ago are now asked routinely . " <p> Certainly , the crackdown has n't obliterated inside trading , fraud and market manipulation . Only Tuesday , the Securities and Exchange Commission settled inside-trading charges against the wife of Genentech Inc . CEO G. Kirk Raab . Inside trading means buying or selling securities based on information that is n't public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger between Genentech and Roche Holding Ltd . She and others involved settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt . The week before , the SEC leveled inside-trading charges at the 12th and 13th individuals caught trading after seeing advance copies of Business Week magazine . <p> The SEC , which initiated 312 enforcement cases in the 12 months that ended September 1989 , equaled that effort this year , says enforcement chief William McLucas . <p> He concedes that fewer involve inside trading - more involve brokers churning accounts ( trading excessively to boost commissions ) and misleading clients . " When the stock market is down , you worry about broker sales practices and pressure on the retail operations that could lead to churning . " If there 's less of the flagrant ' 80s-style cheating going on , credit the collapse of ' 80s-style excesses as much as the crackdown on investor crime . Milken was n't sentenced for building a junk-bond empire . He was n't sentenced for making it the engine behind the frenzy of corporate takeovers and the piling-up of corporate debt that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what many now vilify him for - for selling the nation a lot of fool 's gold . <p> As the economy slowed , debt-laden companies started defaulting on debt . The junk market collapsed . Mergermania dried up . And opportunities for inside trading dried up with it . We wo n't really know just how much of a deterrent the jailing of Milken , Ivan Boesky , Dennis Levine and others will be until Wall Street 's next wild and crazy boom . <p> And that might not come - at least not in a way that sends Wall Street on an unbridled feeding frenzy . The failure of Milken 's idea might have more to do with making Wall Street more honest than with the government 's success in prosecuting him . But many see the change wrought by that failure as lasting . <p> " The aftermath of the magic , tragic ' 80s is a Wall Street with fewer unmarked turns , " says George Ball , chairman and chief executive of Prudential-Bache Securities . There 's far less reliance on financial gimmicks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the ingredients in the blend will be known to all parties , " Ball says . " That makes for a better drink . It might not be as intoxicating , but neither will it leave you with a hangover . " <p> None of this is to say there has been no headway made in deterring corruption on Wall Street . " Instances of insider trading have definitely shriveled , and that is good , " says Harvey Pitt , a lawyer who specializes in securities law who defended Boesky . Among the checks in place since the scandal broke out : <p> - Prison terms for illegal stock trading . Wall Street quaked when judges and juries started sending investment bankers to jail in the late 1980s for violations that used to get mere fines . When Boesky got a three-year term in 1987 , the Street gasped . Milken 's 10-year sentence promises to cement the fear factor for years . <p> " Prison sentences are viewed as one of the most powerful deterrents to the financial community , " U.S. Judge Kimba Wood told an ashen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe a prison term is required for the purposes of general deterrence . " <p> - Stiffer laws . In direct response to the scandal , lawmakers enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 . That upped the penalties for those convicted of criminal charges . Maximum fines for each count went to $ 1 million from $ 100,000 and maximum jail time to 10 years from five years . It also required brokerages to have a formal written policy on the flow of sensitive information and charged them with enforcing the policy . More recent is the Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 . It gives the SEC broader authority to order fines in civil cases . <p> - Closer scrutiny of trades at stock exchanges . The New York Stock Exchange now examines every trade of the previous 30 days by up to 1,300 potential insiders every time one of its listed companies announces market- moving information . " We 're definitely still focused on insider trading , " says Agnes Gautier , vice president of market-trading analysis at the NYSE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . ' " She says inside trades on takeover activity diminished , but she is detecting more instances of illegal trades surrounding corporate dividend or earnings announcements . In addition , the NYSE has closer cooperation with its listed companies than ever , Gautier says . And because of new technology , the NYSE has speeded up its referral service to the SEC to two months , vs. as many as seven months per case in the mid- ' 80s . <p> - Beefed-up in-house compliance . Brokerages across Wall Street are doing a lot more than merely handing out written policies to new employees . Managers at many firms review within 24 hours every trade made by an employee in a position to have valuable inside information . <p> - More international cooperation . Levine , the first big inside trader to fall and the one who tipped the government to Boesky , did his inside trading through secretive foreign brokerages . He was caught because of a fluke . Thanks to the SEC 's efforts since the crackdown began , there 's a great deal more information sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places for cheaters to hide . <p> Many do credit the government crackdown for those changes . " It put the fear of God and Uncle Sam into a lot of people in the securities business , " says Alan Bromberg , securities-law professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas . Certainly , the flagrance of Boesky and others is a thing of the past , even if the wink-of-an-eye-type swapping of inside information " has n't been deterred all that much , " says Stanley Arkin , a New York lawyer who defended several accused inside traders . <p> But Gary Gorton , professor of finance at the Wharton School , predicts that when mergers heat up again , inside trading will make a big comeback . " The Pandora 's box is open on that one , " he says flatly . " Wherever there is money , you will find two things , talent and sleaze . " CUTLINE : DAY OF RECKONING : Michael Milken and his wife , Lori , at court in New York on Wednesday . CUTLINE : GIULIANI : Dishonesty was systemic.
