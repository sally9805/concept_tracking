Silent invaders are playing havoc with our solar system . Right now great and mysterious denizens of the deep  --  frozen clumps of ice , dust , and rock may be slamming into the Sun , exploding in a cascade that will end the invader 's life . The peculiar mystery associated with these invaders exists because they sneak in from behind the Sun , so the Sun 's light makes it difficult to detect them . Called sungrazers , these impressive comets have only recently been photographed and analyzed . Moreover , they are at the heart of an astronomical detective story that stretches back into ancient history . To understand the full ramifications of these silent inhabitants or the solar system , we must go back more than a decade and sift through the evidence that surprised and delighted the astronomers who collected it . A Mission for Sungrazers On August 30 , 1979 , SOLWIND , a Naval Research Laboratory coronagraph launched with the air force 's P78-1 space test program satellite , photographed a small comet just before it disappeared into the Sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show as it vaporized . Its remains brightened more than half the Sun 's disk for over a full day . SOLWIND found five more comets , all members of a family known as the sungrazers , although they did very little grazing . In fact , none of them survived their encounter with our star . In 1984 the coronagraph onboard the Solar Maximum Mission ( SMM ) spacecraft spotted SOLWIND 5 and then took over the role of discoverer . It proceeded to photograph , all by accident , ten more sungrazers in the next five years . Bob MacQueen and Chris St. Cyr , then of the High Altitude Observatory ( HAO ) , published a report on these sungrazing comets . Their data have been useful to Brian Marsden of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Massachusetts , who has traced the lineage of the SOLWIND and SMM comets all the way back to the Stone Age . The Nature of Sungrazers Just what are these sungrazing comets ? They are a peculiar class of solar system wanderers named after German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen of these objects . They are almost impossible to see from Earth because of sunlight and their size . Their orbits cause them to approach Earth between May and October from far behind the Sun and retreat in the same direction . Their small sizes make most of them invisible except during a total eclipse  --  the very means by which one of the brightest of the sungrazers , the comet of 1882 , was located . The so-called Kreutz sungrazers approach the Sun from the south and travel in a retrograde orbit , clockwise around the Sun as viewed from above the Sun 's north pole . They are examples of long-period comets that wander into space from virtually any direction beyond the outskirts o the solar system , falling into a retrograde orbit . This contrasts markedly with the so-called short-period comets which are well-behaved members of the solar system , reflecting the orderly motion expected o matter associated with the formation o the planets . Their orbits lie roughly in the plane of the ecliptic and they travel in the same direction as the planets themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in toward the Sun in wild orbits that slam them into the Sun , and they can remain unseen by astronomers  --  even during and after their demise . Marsden 's family tree for the Kreutz sungrazers allows our imagination to wander . About 15,000 years ago , give or take 5,000 , a great comet was visible . Back then New England was under 5,000 feet of ice and you could have skied at an elevation thousands of feet above the Great Lakes . More than a quarter of the world was covered in glaciers , and in Europe Neanderthal hominids had ceased to exist , overwhelmed by the newly dominant species , Homo sapiens . Echoes of an Ancient Past The Magdelanian people lived in the final stages of the last Ice Age . They were skillful in making things of bone , ivory , and flint , and their art was probably intended as " hunting magic , " a ritual incantation to fill the belly . Those people probably saw a great comet that filled their hearts with ear and awe . Here was a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave painting provided no succor . They could not have realized that they were seeing great comets that would erode through the ages to produce fragments visible in the night skies of their descendants . And so it went until one o the fragments filled the skies with a glorious spectacle in 371 BC , the year Aristotle and Ephorus gazed at this cosmic visitor , a mere shadow of its long-forgotten ancestor . This comet had its own close encounter with the Sun , which it survived as two or three fragments that were seen again around 1100 . One likely candidate was the comet of 1106 . Fitting Together the Pieces The offspring of these comets are still in perilous orbits that bring them within a solar radius of the surface of the Sun . They brush within 700,000 kilometers of disaster , and few now manage to escape . All the fragments observed by the spacecraft in the last decade have disappeared into the cauldron . And this , after traveling from the depths of interstellar space , from about 30 billion kilometers away , seven times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last hundreds if not a thousand years . The comets discovered by SOLWIND and SMM are all distant offspring of the ice age comets . Every one or these fragments disappeared at perihelion . No one is sure whether they crashed , evaporated , or were simply reduced of their volatile substances to the point that they no longer glowed . The Kreutz sungrazer family consists of several sub-groups . Marsden classified the comets of 1843 , 1880 , 1887 , and 1963 as subgroup I ( see box ) . ( Box omitted ) . The SOLWIND and SMM comets also belong to this group . The second subgroup includes the sungrazers of 1882 and 1965 , the latter better known as Comet Ikeya-Seki . These two objects separated at the previous perihelion passage , which occurred around 1100 , and one of them may have been the bright comet of 1106 . Other members of subgroup II are 1945 II and perhaps bright comets seen in 1689 and 1702 . The single member of the third subgroup is Comet 1970 VI . Few of the current visitors survive their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason the sungrazer 1963 V survived its perihelion passage was that the gravitational tug of Jupiter managed to sway its path enough to avoid disaster . The break up of the most spectacular sungrazer in recent times occurred with 1882 II . That event led Heinrich Kreutz to examine the data , and he predicted its four fragments would return in 670 , 770 , 880 , and 960 years . Since the perihelion distances of the fragments evolve with time , bringing them ever closer to the Sun , these four are also likely to be annihilated when they return . Not all of the sungrazers have fallen to their doom . In 1965 , Comet Ikeya-Seki lit up the heavens and was seen by millions of people in a rare , brilliant display from a member of a class that typically is notoriously hard to view . It is very likely that many more small fragments lie in associated orbits . Few ( if any ) will be seen in the next several years because no coronagraphs are currently in orbit . Until another coronagraph is launched , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during future solar eclipses , when with luck , we might catch one of these elusive comets in the act or being swallowed up by the Sun . Gerrit L. Verschuur is an astronomer and freelance writer living in Bowie , Maryland . His last article was " Star Dust " in the March 1992 issue . <p>                     @x In April 2008 , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinej ad visited Pakistan as part of a whistle-stop tour of South Asia . The meeting was cordial but tense . While the two neighbors were once staunch Cold War allies , the Islamic Revolution , Afghanistan 's civil war , and Pakistan 's nuclear development have transformed the relationship into one of tense rivalry . As Afghanistan 's stability has become a U.S. strategic concern , preventing Pakistan-Iran tensions from again transforming Afghanistan into a proxy battlefield should be a U.S. interest . Unfortunately , so long as the Iranian and Pakistani governments remain concerned with the defense of Shi'i and Sunni sectarian interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to bring stability but at best may remain referees in a struggle that extends far beyond that country 's borders . <p> L : A TROUBLED TRIANGLE Pakistan and Iran are bound by cultural , tribal , and religious bonds . Pakistan gained its independence in 1947 at the beginning of the Cold War . Iran became the first state to recognize the new nation , and the two neighbors soon developed a strong partnership , signing a treaty of friendship in 1950 . Some of this was geopolitical . Pakistan was born amidst great bloodshed and a transfer of population with India , a country with which Pakistan has territorial disputes to the present day . Pakistan found a natural partner in Iran after the Indian government chose to support Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser who sought to export a pan-Arab ideology that threatened many Arab monarchies , a number of which were favored by the Iranian shah . Iran was a natural ally and model for Pakistan for other reasons as well . Both had majority Muslim populations but remained secular , centralized , and Western-oriented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trade purposes ; the shah offered Iranian oil and gas to Pakistan on generous terms , and the Iranian and Pakistani armies cooperated to suppress the rebel movement in Baluchistan. ( n1 ) <p> Both countries also became major bulwarks of U.S. policy in the Middle East . Both were firm U.S. allies and members of the anti-Soviet Baghdad Pact . In 1971 , however , the geopolitical situation began to shift . The withdrawal of British forces from the Persian Gulf left the United States to fill the vacuum , making Saudi Arabia far more important in U.S. strategic calculus . Pakistan 's defeat in its 1971 war with India -- and the loss of half its territory with Bangladesh 's independence -- led it to court China as a means to balance India . Pakistan also sought closer ties with the Arab states in order to isolate India , and thus weakened its ties to Iran , even though Islamabad-Tehran relations remained cordial . <p> The shah 's fall in 1979 was a blow to Pakistan . Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 's anti-American posture worried the Pakistani authorities , as did the prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , in 1979 , perhaps 20 percent of Pakistan 's population was Shi'i and , at the same time , Khomeini 's religious rhetoric sparked radicalism across the sectarian divide . Nevertheless , Islamabad offered an olive branch to Tehran . Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize the new Islamic Republic and was among very few countries in the region that refrained from supporting Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. ( n2 ) <p> The 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan brought the Soviet Union to Pakistan 's doorstep , transforming the geostrategic environment further , all the more so given India 's close ties to Moscow . For the United States , concerned about Soviet expansionism , Pakistan 's importance rose . Ironically , Pakistan , Iran , and the United States all found themselves on the same side with regard to Afghanistan , even as Iran 's revolutionary authorities continued to hold U.S. diplomats hostage . Though Iran was preoccupied with domestic turmoil and its war with Iraq in the 1980s , it supported the Afghan resistance and provided limited financial and military assistance to groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , Pakistan emerged as the frontline state in the U.S. struggle to expel the Soviets from Afghanistan . Here , the Pakistani military regime under General Zia ul-Haq did try to coordinate with the Islamic Republic but , in practice , Islamabad cooperated much more fully with Saudi Arabia , which bankrolled Pakistani military programs. ( n3 ) <p> Pakistan became the transit point for weapons and aid to Saudi-funded , U.S.-equipped , and Pakistani-trained mujahideen who fought to drive the Red Army from Afghanistan . Pakistani authorities , however , put a filter on the aid . The loss of Bangladesh -- formerly East Pakistan -- in 1971 had led the Pakistani leadership to be very wary of ethnic nationalism . Pashtun nationalism in Afghanistan had challenged Pakistani cohesion for as long as Bengali nationalism. n4 The Pakistani government , therefore , only allowed aid to flow to those groups who rallied around a sectarian rather than a nationalist identity . <p> The Iranian authorities , in contrast , miscalculated . While generous with aid to their allies , they had far fewer resources at their disposal because of the ongoing war of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide , they limited largely to Shi'i and ethnic Persian-speaking Tajik groups . This transformed a potential Afghanistan-wide influence into a far more localized interest . Nor , in contrast to the actions of the Pakistani leadership , did Iranian authorities properly cultivate or manage their population of Afghan refugees in order to spread their influence. ( n5 ) <p> Tehran did not want to cede the advantage to Islamabad , though , and continued to fight for influence in Afghanistan , even as the Pakistani- and Saudi-backed Taliban consolidated control over 90 percent of the country . This proxy fight , however , polarized Afghanistan and brewed further Pakistan-Iran mistrust . <p> In August 1998 , after an incident in which the Taliban sacked an Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif and murdered six Iranian diplomats and some agents , the Iranian military massed some seventy thousand troops on their border with Afghanistan and blamed Pakistan , claiming that Pakistan had assured the safety of their diplomats. n6 Iranian president Mohammad Khatami , however , helped walk Iran back from the brink of war as he sought to thaw relations between Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 9-11 terrorist attacks on the United States changed the foreign policy priorities of both Iran and Pakistan . The George W. Bush administration 's tough stance forced president Pervez Musharraf to support Washington 's " war on terror , " which ended Taliban rule in Kabul. n7 Though Iranian officials welcomed the move , they soon found themselves encircled by U.S. forces in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Central Asia , and the Persian Gulf . President Bush 's inclusion of the Islamic Republic as part of an " Axis of Evil " also led some Iranian officials to presume that Tehran might be next in line for regime changes and ended whatever dtente had occurred in U.S.-Iranian ties under Khatami . Bush 's emphasis on transformative diplomacy and democratization n9 worried Iranian leaders further . <p> Tehran and Islamabad sought to improve bilateral relations after the Taliban 's 2001 fall . Iran supported the Bonn agreement which , under U.N . auspices , brought prominent Afghans together to plan for the future governance of their war-ravaged nation. n10 In December 2002 , Iran signed the Kabul Declaration on Good Neighborly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Islamabad in December 2002 , the first visit by an Iranian head of state since 1992 . Iran has tried to project itself as a responsible regional actor since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 , urging the Afghan Northern Alliance to accept the Bonn agreement for the formation of a new broad-based government in Kabul and offering aid and loans as well as training Afghan soldiers. n12 It is investing in construction projects in the western parts of Afghanistan , building roads , rail links , and border posts. n13 It played a major role in restarting the post-Taliban political process in Afghanistan and has pledged $560 million in aid and loans to Afghanistan. n14 However , other interests are also at play as Iran supports conservative Shi'i religious schools and warlords and is increasing its intelligence activities across Afghanistan. n15 Iran has viewed itself traditionally as the guarantor of the security of Afghanistan 's Shi'a . <p> However , the situation in Afghanistan continued to overshadow the relationship . Tehran moved promptly to establish diplomatic ties with Hamid Karzai 's new government. n16 Iranian authorities supported Karzai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afghanistan , encouraging the Hazara , for example , to support Karzai , despite his Pashtun background . Tehran 's links to Ismail Khan , the former Herat governor , were especially strong . However , Iranian officials supported the U.S. and Afghan central government 's efforts to subordinate Khan -- who acted as Iran 's proxy in Afghanistan -- to Kabul 's authority. ( n17 ) <p> L : SOFT AND HARD POWER IN THE AFGHANISTAN RIVALRY While Karzai 's government is nominally supported by both Tehran and Islamabad , neither neighbor has been willing to sacrifice its own interests . With time , tension has increased . Iran retains its special interests in Afghanistan 's western Herat region , until 1857 part of Iran , and Pakistan considers the Pashto-speaking southern sections of Afghanistan to be within its sphere of influence . Kabul remains a contested area within that sphere . The deterioration in Afghan security , perhaps sparked by one or both , has also created a dynamic of increasing tension between Iran and Pakistan. n18 Increasingly , as a perception of U.S. weakness spreads , Iran has raised its rhetoric against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Islamabad nominally supports , at least publicly . Tehran continues to blame the U.S. presence in Afghanistan for continuing instability in the region. ( n19 ) <p> Both Iran and Pakistan have adopted strategies of using soft power influence to provide cover for their more traditional hard power approach vis -- vis Afghanistan . Though Musharraf committed Pakistan to support efforts to stabilize Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban and agreed to strengthen the Karzai administration , doubts remain as to Islamabad 's capacity and commitment to crack down on terrorists and militants . Kabul is suspicious of Pakistan , on whom its security largely depends . Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency has long supported the Taliban and has aided its resurgence . The rejuvenation of the Taliban bolsters Pakistan 's role as a frontline state in the war on terrorism , securing often lucrative assistance from the United States . The ISI and Pakistani military elite also see Pakistan as engaged in a proxy war for influence in Afghanistan. n20 The Taliban may be a concern to both Kabul and Washington , but Islamabad is more willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward on Afghanistan , Kashmir , or other parts of India . The brazen terror assault on Mumbai in November 2008 that has increased tensions between the two nuclear armed states in the subcontinent is just the latest case of Islamabad continuing to direct Islamist extremism towards its neighbors . <p> Iran , meanwhile , has taken a multi-pronged approach towards Afghanistan , focusing its economic , social , and educational efforts on the western provinces of Herat , Farah , and Nimruz , perhaps to seek a zone of influence in western Afghanistan and to prevent the West and the Karzai administration from adopting a coherent , countrywide strategy. n21 While Iran has focused its development aid on portions of Afghanistan it considers its near-abroad , Tehran has learned a political lesson from the past and now cooperates with any Afghan group , regardless of sect and language , so long as they oppose the U.S. presence in Afghanistan . The perception that Pakistan and the United States would gain an upper hand in the evolving political environment in Afghanistan has pushed Iran into charting a pro-active course towards its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward hastening the withdrawal of U.S. forces , preventing the Taliban from regaining power , and trying to keep Afghanistan under Tehran 's sway . <p> As a result of this policy , some Iranian groups appear to have reached out to the Taliban . U.S. and NATO forces have repeatedly intercepted shipments of Iranian weaponry to the Taliban. n22 The Taliban are already using Iranian-made improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) as well as heat seeking missiles and rifles to deadly effect against Western forces. n23 Though the Iranian government has denied any such involvement , sections of the Iranian establishment , in particular the Quds Force , are seen as behind such moves . Several media reports from Afghanistan suggest that Iran has been increasing its operations in Afghanistan in an effort to gain influence with the contending insurgent factions and to hasten the departure of U.S. troops from the country. n24 Growing tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan are also working to Iran 's advantage with Kabul increasingly dependent on Tehran for its transit trade routes . The Karzai government can not pick fights with both its vital neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Washington maintains that Iran is funneling weapons into Afghanistan , the Afghan government continues to say that Iran is a close friend and ally. ( n25 ) <p> L : WILL A PAKISTAN-IRANIAN RIVALRY ERUPT ? There is little common ground between Iran and Pakistan on a solution to the Afghan crisis , and history may repeat itself with both states once again funding proxy wars between Shi'a and Sunnis in each other 's countries as well as in Afghanistan , increasing the likelihood of a major sectarian explosion in the region . <p> Communities of some five million Baluch tribesmen stretch across southwestern Pakistan and southeastern Iran . Baluchis on both sides of the border feel neglected , on sectarian grounds in Iran and on ethnic grounds in Pakistan , and nationalist sentiments have long simmered , sometimes erupting into open insurrection. n26 While the shah helped the Pakistani army crush Baluch insurgencies in the days prior to his ouster , today insurgency has again erupted with both Pakistani and Iranian officials accusing each other of aiding the insurgents . Tehran has also repeatedly accused the U.S. Special Forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Iran designed to foment Baluch opposition to the Islamic regime. n27 In June 2008 , Jundallah terrorists , an insurgent Baluchi group operating from Pakistan , kidnapped sixteen members of Iran 's paramilitary Law Enforcement Forces ( niru-ye entezami ) and , over the course of months , executed all of their hostages. n28 Tehran blames the Pakistani government for sheltering the group even though Pakistan has also declared Jundallah to be a terrorist organization and , on occasion , Pakistani troops have killed Jundallah terrorists. ( n29 ) <p> Sectarian tension has also complicated relations . In the 1980s , several radical groups sponsored by Pakistani intelligence n30 began a systematic assault on Shi'i symbols and mosques in Pakistan . Pakistani Shi'a , with Iranian assistance , responded by forming their own militias . The continued targeting by Sunni terrorists of Pakistani Shi'a remains an Iranian concern. n31 This Shi'i-Sunni strife in Pakistan has provoked Iran to provide clandestine support to its co-religionists there. ( n32 ) <p> However , Pakistan and Iran have worked to improve security cooperation . In 2001 , the two states established the Pakistan-Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues such as terrorism , drug trafficking , and sectarian violence . Top Iranian political and intelligence officials regularly engage their Pakistani counterparts , but engagement does not necessarily equate to trust . <p> The nuclear issue also complicates Pakistani-Iranian ties . Pakistani and Western officials sometimes say that Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadir Khan operated outside the law when he provided assistance to Tehran 's nuclear weapons program ; however , evidence also suggests that the Pakistani military was not only aware of Khan 's nuclear transactions with Iran but also tacitly approved of his activities. n33 Nevertheless , there remains a sense of rivalry between Islamabad and Tehran on the nuclear issue , given Pakistan 's unique position as the sole Muslim country with the bomb . Interestingly , one of the drivers of Iran 's nuclear weapons ambitions is fear of a " Sunni bomb . " Rumors of an oil-for-nukes pact between Riyadh and Islamabad have exacerbated such concerns. ( n34 ) <p> L : AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION ? Is it possible to ameliorate Iran-Pakistan ties to prevent the development of a dynamic that will undercut Afghan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U.S. and NATO troops present in that country ? Here , economics may provide a solution . Trade between Pakistan and Iran remains in the range of $500 million , and both governments hope to double it. n35 Absent much trade , however , political and security tensions will continue to exercise a negative effect on ties . <p> It is in this context that the impetus comes for the so-called " peace pipeline " that would transport Iranian gas to Pakistan and onward to India . Should the pipeline project come into operation , then trade will become the defining feature of Iran-Pakistan ties . Rising energy demand in both India and Pakistan , at least until the 2008 worldwide recession struck , have led both to consider collaborating on a gas pipeline from Iranian fields through Pakistan to India . Such a pipeline might in theory create mutual economic interests and bring Islamabad perhaps $500 million annually in royalties. n36 However , there has been little progress , largely because of disagreements about pricing and the methods to be used to supply gas to India. n37 India and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahmadinejad assumed the presidency and while the crude oil price was low . India considers the pricing deal final while Iranian officials have sought an upward revision in price , arguing that the contract is not valid until the Iranian Supreme Economic Council ratifies it. n38 There are also differences between the national oil companies of Iran and India over the legal interpretation of the contract for the export of five million tons of liquefied natural gas to India . <p> Both India and Pakistan have contended that Tehran should offer a price for gas in line with global practices for long-term contracts and have rejected Iran 's gas pricing formula , whereby the gas price is linked to Brent crude oil with a fixed escalating cost component . The Indian government also argues that it should only pay for gas upon delivery , and opposes Tehran 's demand for price revision every three years. n39 The three states decided by consensus to refer the matter to an independent consultant , but Tehran continued to maintain that the consultant 's opinion should not be binding , causing tensions among the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has led to much recrimination but little construction. n40 Other points of contention include Pakistan 's costs for security and transit and U.S. government opposition to any investment in an Iranian project n41 alongside Iranian worries that tensions between Pakistan and India could disrupt operations and undermine economic viability. ( n42 ) <p> L : CONCLUSION Notwithstanding some tentative recent attempts by Pakistan and Iran to improve their bilateral ties , the two countries ' relationship remains strained . Rather than bringing the two states together , the situation in Afghanistan has provided a stage where their rivalry is once again played out . Though the vacuum resulting from the fall of the Taliban government is the main factor behind the rising turmoil in Afghanistan , n43 the problem there also remains a regional one . The more the United States and its NATO allies fail to secure Afghanistan , the more neighboring states will revive their ties to ethnic and ideological proxies , creating a dynamic that will further undermine Afghanistan . <p> While both Pakistan and Iran seem to have concluded that a stable , independent , and economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , they remain very sensitive to their relative gains vis -- vis each other . <p> Regardless of who runs Afghanistan , Tehran 's and Islamabad 's conflicting interests over Afghanistan have played a pivotal role in the formation of their foreign policies toward each other . Afghanistan 's predicament is a difficult one . The country may like to enhance its links with its neighboring states , yet , peace and stability will continue to elude it so long as its neighbors view it through the lenses of their regional rivalries and as a chessboard on which to play out the game of their regional power and influence . <p> In many ways , it is a paradox . The situation in Afghanistan can only improve if Tehran and Islamabad revise their attitudes , but any deterioration in Afghanistan 's security situation will instead compound suspicions and force them to prioritize their own security interests in a way which intensifies regional rivalries . Iran will only play a positive role in Afghanistan if it feels its vital interests are not under threat , and a deteriorating security environment in Afghanistan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take steps to safeguard its interests , letting the conflict spiral further . Pakistan , meanwhile , is reluctant to cede the preeminent position it has enjoyed for the last several decades in determining Afghanistan 's political trajectory . And as the security environment in Afghanistan deteriorates further , Islamabad will view this as an opportunity to maintain its presence in its neighbor 's territory in order to secure its larger strategic interests . <p> By no means does this suggest that the United States or its NATO allies should abandon Afghanistan . However , U.S. policymakers should recognize that they are not the only players in the sand box nor that their struggle to stabilize the Karzai regime and battle the Taliban is the only fight going on in the country . Indeed , until there is fundamental change in either Tehran or Islamabad , Afghanistan will remain a crossroad if not for armies , then for their proxies . <p> L : Footnotes  --  ( n1 ) Shahram Chubin and Sepehr Zabin , The Foreign Relations of Iran ( Berkeley : University of California Press , 1974 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pakistan-Iran Relations in the Changing World Scenario : Challenges and Response , " in Tarik Jain , et al , eds. , Foreign Policy Debate : The Years Ahead ( Islamabad : Institute of Policy Studies , 1993 ) , pp. 215-9 . <p>  --  ( n3 ) Stephen Cohen , The Idea of Pakistan ( Washington , D.C. : Brookings Institution Press , 2004 ) , p. 122 . <p>  --  ( n4 ) Michael Rubin , " Who 's Responsible for the Taliban ?
