It 's four in the morning and I 'm fighting to stay awake . I hope some more hot tea and cookies will help recharge my system sufficiently so I can choose which star gets the honor of the last exposure . This is my third and final night on the Mayall 4-meter telescope on Kitt Peak , outside Tucson , Arizona , and so far it has been the clearest night of the three . I think I 'll finally get some good spectra for our white dwarf study . This observing project is a collaboration among Caty Pilachowski of Kitt Peak National Observatory , Bob Milkey of the Space Telescope Science Institute , and me . Caty and Bob are attending astronomical meetings elsewhere , so one of my contributions to the project is making the observations . Although I 'm observing in November , our project got started the previous February when we submitted a proposal to the telescope allocation committee requesting three nights on the 4-meter telescope . We need its light-gathering power to observe our faint white dwarfs . And the 4-meter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf spectra . We heard in June that we were granted all three nights . I felt quite lucky because most telescopes on Kitt Peak are oversubscribed . For the August 1991 to February 1992 observing semester , only 49 out of 111 proposals were granted time on the 4-meter , so some astronomers will have to reapply next year when their objects are again visible . The stars we are interested in are called DA white dwarfs . Roughly two-thirds of white dwarfs are of type DA . When the Sun finally uses up its nuclear fuel , it most likely will end its life as this type of white dwarf . The D signifies that the spectrum comes from a degenerate star . ( The pressure created by electrons in a special state called degeneracy prevents white dwarfs from collapsing . ) The A refers to the fact that only hydrogen lines are visible in the star 's spectrum . These stars typically range in temperature from 10,000 to 50,000 kelvins , in mass from 0.2 to 0.9 solar mass , and in radius from 6,000 to 15,000 kilometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,800 kelvins ) but about the size of Earth . Specifically , our project is to measure how quickly these white dwarfs rotate . During the run , we hope to obtain accurate rotation rates for a few more white dwarfs . We also want to observe several white dwarfs again because their rotation rates are uncertain . We measure the rotation rate of a white dwarf by analyzing the shape of the red hydrogen-alpha line in the star 's spectrum . Preferably , we would like to use more than one line , but DA white dwarfs produce few lines in their spectra ( see spectra on page 41 ) . ( Spectra omitted ) . Rotation makes spectral lines broader . By measuring how broad a star 's spectral lines are , we can tell how fast the star rotates . A star like the Sun is considered a slow rotator because it rotates only once every 25 days . But the Sun 's rotation rate will become even slower when the Sun runs out of nuclear fuel in its core and expands into a red giant star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spin , the Sun will rotate more slowly as a red giant . But this is n't the final step in the Sun 's aging process . After the red giant phase , it will become a white dwarf . To become a white dwarf , the Sun must shrink to about the size of Earth . As it shrinks , it will start spinning faster , like the spinning figure skater pulling in the arms . White dwarfs , from this line of reasoning , should rotate once or twice every minute . However , researchers have found that white dwarfs rotate at a much slower rate  --  about twice per hour . Why these stars rotate so slowly still puzzles astronomers . If all of the observations from this observing run turn out okay , we 'll have spectra for ten stars . Taking spectra of faint white dwarfs is a slow process , even on a 4-meter telescope . In order to measure the spectrum accurately , we must observe each star for two or three hours . The hardest part is staying awake because everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when the astronomer would ride the Cassegrain cage to guide the star image along the entrance to the spectrometer , we now sit in a warm console room . Computers slew the telescope to the next object , move the dome to follow the telescope , control the CCD camera on the spectrometer , and display the CCD image . Automatic guiders relieve the astronomer of the tedium of guiding the telescope for several hours . Since computers now do most of the work , the time astronomers used to spend guiding and moving the telescope and dome is now free . On previous observing runs , I tried to read professional journals , but I found the journals to be more powerful than sleeping pills at 2 a.m . Now I mostly read fiction . I actually reel a little extraneous with the computers doing most of the work and can see the day when astronomers will routinely " observe " from their home institutions through a computer link to the observatory . Even though the job is easier , the work day is still long . This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again at 2 p.m. to sort through my star list for the night 's objects . Before dinner at 5 p.m. , I started the CCD calibration procedures because we do n't want to use valuable observing time on these camera exposures . A quick dinner  --  or was it breakfast ?  --  and I was back at the telescope as the Sun set . Astronomers do n't get to move the telescope . Large telescope operators ( LTOs ) are assigned to assist astronomers on the large scopes at Kitt Peak . They decide if the telescope should be closed because of the weather and they move the telescope and dome for the observer . The LTOs also help with instrument and computer problems . They are an indispensable part of the observing team and often do n't get the recognition they deserve for making the observing run successful . Finally deciding on a white dwarf called EG46 as the last star to observe , I hand the star 's coordinates to Dave Chamberlin , my LTO this night . He types them into the telescope control computer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this telescope is so accurate that the star arrives almost directly on the entrance aperture of the spectrometer . Dave sets the automatic guider and I start the exposure . I do n't have to make any adjustments to the spectrometer tanks to another key member of the observatory staff , Darryl Willmarth . Darryl was the support scientist assigned to help set up the instrument used during my run . He showed me how to use the spectrometer and the new computer system . These kind , helpful support scientists are often wakened by grumpy astronomers whose research is temporarily stymied by some problem . I 'm thankful I have n't had to call Darryl at all during this run since the instrument has worked smoothly . I wish I could say the same about the weather . The first night of our run was cloudy and windy . Jean Nowakowski was my LTO then and she kept a watchful eye on the weather . If the humidity gets too high or the wind speed creeps over 45 miles per hour , the telescope must be closed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we might have to close . Fortunately , the wind kept below 35 miles per hour . The wind can play interesting tricks on you around the telescopes . Somehow the one door at the base of the 4-meter building always managed to rattle just after I walked by it . At least it was n't as eerie as the McMath solar telescope used to be before the wind screen was installed . When the wind blew across the top of the McMath , it was like air sounding an organ pipe . The telescope would moan and howl like a lost soul . Of course , the 4-meter has its own tricks . When the dome rotates , the floor trembles slightly as if a mild earthquake has struck the mountain . The telescope is mounted on a pier that is separate from the dome support , so it does n't feel the dome movement . But unsuspecting , dozing astronomers have sometimes been awakened by the tremor . The unstable atmospheric conditions that night also affected the seeing . Star images were over 4 arcseconds in diameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little star light entered the spectrometer . The already faint white dwarfs appeared more than one magnitude fainter . Also , the humid air caused clouds to form directly overhead . We fought a grim duel with the clouds , opening and closing the dome , until the clouds dispersed after midnight . Jean 's job started at sunset when she first opened the dome to equalize the temperature of the air inside and outside the dome to optimize the seeing . Sunset was spectacular , thanks to the dust cloud from the Mount Pinatubo eruption . While we waited for the sky to get dark , we took some calibration frames for the CCD camera . Jean 's job did n't end at sunrise , because another astronomer , Ken Hinkle , came on duty to observe for a few hours after daybreak . Jean then helped Alex Macdonald , the LTO who assisted Ken , to rotate the cage at the front end of the telescope . The cage holds two secondary mirrors back-to-back . My program uses the Cassegrain secondary because the spectrometer is mounted at the back-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted two floors below the telescope , so the coude secondary must be used to focus light at his instrument . Ken is an infrared astronomer and was looking at IRC +10216 , a carbon star that is obscured by a circumstellar shell . He aimed to find the relative abundance of hydrogen to carbon for this object . Astronomers need this ratio to estimate how much mass is lost each year by IRC +10216 . Ken can observe during the day because Earth 's atmosphere is relatively dark in the infrared . Jean was again my LTO on the second night . The wind and poor seeing continued , so the spectra did not look very good . I worried greatly that the entire observing run would be a wasted effort . If we did n't get data from this run , it would be several years before we again were on the 4-meter . Sometime during the night , someone called with a report of a bright meteor that had streaked across the sky . Unfortunately , we were in a closed room and did n't see anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another morning of observing . Finally , on this last night of my run , the wind died down and the seeing got a little better . It 's not great at 2 arcseconds , but one gets more light into the spectrometer and better spectra . Observing went so much better that Dave worked through his normal midnight lunch time and I skipped lunch altogether . Although many large telescopes are being built on Mauna Kea in Hawaii , Kitt Peak still has the single largest collection of telescopes in the world , with new additions planned . The University of Wisconsin , Indiana University , Yale University , and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories ( NOAO , Kitt Peak 's parent organization ) have joined to build the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope at the site where a 0.9-meter telescope resided or many years ( bottom left of photograph on page 38 ) . ( Photograph omitted ) . The National Radio Astronomy Observatory operates two telescopes on a ridge to the west of the Kitt Peak observatory site . Case Western Reserve runs a Schmidt camera on the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including those of Steward Observatory ( 2.3 meters ) and the Spacewatch program ( 0.9 meter ) . McGraw-Hill Observatory , operated by the University of Michigan , MIT and Dartmouth College , has 1.3-and 2.4-meter telescopes . Another branch of NOAO , the National Solar Observatory , has its McMath and vacuum telescopes on the mountain . Although originally used almost exclusively for solar observations , the McMath also has an active laboratory spectroscopy program and a vigorous nighttime stellar observing program . Astronomers currently are exploring the feasibility of upgrading the McMath 's 1.5-meter optics to 4 meters . Larger mirrors would enhance solar observations in the infrared and the nighttime programs . Even the visitor center is being upgraded . Visitors may tour the observatory from 9 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. every day , except Thanksgiving Day , December 24 and 25 , and New Year 's Day . Be aware that the observatory is at an altitude of nearly 7,000 feet and that you 'll need to walk a lot to tour the telescopes . Also note that the weather on the mountain may be considerably cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the visitor center to admire the basketry of the Tohono O'odham Indians , who own the land upon which the observatory sits . Now it 's 6 a.m. and the end of my observing run . If this were a novel , I would be driving back to Tucson as the Sun rises . Instead , I still have several hours of work to do , copying our hard-won data to magnetic tape and making copies of the observing logbook . As the data flow silently onto the tape , I wonder whether the observing run has been a success . Unfortunately , we wo n't know until we analyze the data . But with any luck , we 'll have gained new knowledge about the rotation of white dwarfs  --  and maybe , with an extra bit of luck , we 'll learn a little more about how stars evolve from giants into white dwarf . <p>                     @x When a husband murders a wife or daughter in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter up to domestic violence . Murder is murder ; religion is irrelevant . Honor killings are , however , distinct from wife battering and child abuse . Analysis of more than fifty reported honor killings shows they differ significantly from more common domestic violence. n1 The frequent argument made by Muslim advocacy organizations that honor killings have nothing to do with Islam and that it is discriminatory to differentiate between honor killings and domestic violence is wrong . <p> L : BACKGROUND AND DENIAL Families that kill for honor will threaten girls and women if they refuse to cover their hair , their faces , or their bodies or act as their family 's domestic servant ; wear makeup or Western clothing ; choose friends from another religion ; date ; seek to obtain an advanced education ; refuse an arranged marriage ; seek a divorce from a violent husband ; marry against their parents ' wishes ; or behave in ways that are considered too independent , which might mean anything from driving a car to spending time or living away from home or family . Fundamentalists of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these expectations . But when women refuse to do so , Jews , Christians , and Buddhists are far more likely to shun rather than murder them . Muslims , however , do kill for honor , as do , to a lesser extent , Hindus and Sikhs . <p> The United Nations Population Fund estimates that 5,000 women are killed each year for dishonoring their families. n2 This may be an underestimate . Aamir Latif , a correspondent for the Islamist website Islam Online who writes frequently on the issue , reported that in 2007 in the Punjab province of Pakistan alone , there were 1,261 honor murders. n3 The Aurat Foundation , a Pakistani nongovernmental organization focusing on women 's empowerment , found that the rate of honor killings was on track to be in the hundreds in 2008. ( n4 ) <p> There are very few studies of honor killing , however , as the motivation for such killings is cleansing alleged dishonor and the families do not wish to bring further attention to their shame , so do not cooperate with researchers . Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went missing or committed suicide . Nevertheless , honor crimes are increasingly visible in the media . Police , politicians , and feminist activists in Europe and in some Muslim countries are beginning to treat them as a serious social problem. ( n5 ) <p> Willingness to address the problem of honor killing , however , does not extend to many Muslim advocacy groups in North America . The well-publicized denials of U.S.-based advocacy groups are ironic given the debate in the Middle East . While the religious establishment in Jordan , for example , says that honor killing is a relic of pre-Islamic Arab culture , Muslim Brotherhood groups in Jordan have publicly disagreed to argue the Islamic religious imperative to protect honor. ( n6 ) <p> Yotam Feldner , a researcher at the Middle East Media Research Institute , quotes a psychiatrist in Gaza who describes the honor killing culture as one in which a man who refrains from " washing shame with blood " is a " coward who is not worthy of living ... as less than a man . " Therefore , it is no surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers . While honor killing may be a custom that originated in the pagan , pre-Islamic past , contemporary Islamist interpretations of religious law prevail . As Feldner puts it : " Some important Islamic scholars in Jordan have even gone further by declaring honor crimes an Islamic imperative that derives from the ' values of virility advocated by Islam . ' " ( n7 ) <p> Islamist advocacy organizations , however , argue that such killings have nothing to do with Islam or Muslims , that domestic violence cuts across all faiths , and that the phrase " honor killing " stigmatizes Muslims whose behavior is no different than that of non-Muslims . For example , in response to a well-publicized 2000 honor killing , SoundVision.com , an Islamic information and products site , published an article that argued , <p> Four other women were killed in Chicago in the same month ... They were white , African-American , Hispanic , and Asian ... Islam is not responsible for the Muslim woman 's death . Nor is Christianity responsible for the deaths of the other women. ( n8 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father in Toronto for not wearing hijab ( a head covering ) , Sheila Musaji wrote in the American Muslim , " Although this certainly is a case of domestic violence ... ' honor ' killings are not only a Muslim problem , and there is no ' honor ' involved . " n9 Mohammed Elmasry , of the Canadian Islamic Congress , also dismissed the problem . " I do n't want the public to think that this is an Islamic issue or an immigrant issue . It is a teenager issue , " he said. ( n10 ) <p> Indeed , denial is fife . In 2008 , after Kandeela Sandal was murdered for honor by her father in Atlanta because she wanted a divorce , Ajay Nair , associate dean of multicultural affairs at Columbia University , told the media that " most South Asian communities in the United States " enjoy " wonderful " relationships within their families and said , " This is n't a rampant problem within South Asian communities . What is a problem , I think , is domestic violence , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mustafaa Carroll , executive director of the Dallas branch of the Council of American-Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) , dismissed any Islamic connection to a prominent Dallas honor killing , labeled as such by the FBI , arguing , " As far as we 're concerned , until the motive is proven in a court of law , this is just a homicide . " He continued , " We Muslims do n't have the market on jealous husbands ... or domestic violence ... This is not Islamic culture . " ( n12 ) <p> Case studies suggest otherwise . <p> L : DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VERSUS HONOR KILLING Domestic violence is a significant problem in the United States . Between 1989 and 2004 , 21,124 women died at the hands of an intimate ; 8,997 men died in domestic violence during the same time period. n13 Because the U.S. Department of Justice does not catalogue the victim 's or murderer 's age , religion , ethnic background , or immigration status , it is not possible to know what proportion of these killings are honor-related . <p> Unni Wikan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defines honor killing as " a murder carried out as a commission from the extended family , to restore honor after the family has been dishonored . As a rule , the basic cause is a rumor that any female family member has behaved in an immoral way . " n14 While honor killings are just a minority of total domestic violence in the United States and Canada , they constitute a distinct phenomenon . ( See Table 1 , page 62 . ) A 2008 Massachusetts-based study found that " although immigrants make up an estimated 14 percent of the state 's population , they , nevertheless , accounted for 26 percent of the 180 domestic violence deaths from 1997-2006. " ( n15 ) <p> Lenore Walker , author of The Battered Woman Syndrome , n16 agreed that fundamentalist immigrants control and patrol their women very closely . " Given the strict rules , there are a lot of things to kill them for , " she said . Walker confirmed the difference between the victim-perpetrator in honor killings and ordinary domestic violence : <p> In ordinary domestic violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters or for male cousins to kill female cousins . And while child abuse occurs in which fathers may kill infants and children , it is very rare for Western fathers to kill teenage daughters. ( n17 ) <p> Other discrepancies exist . Walker observed that Western men are more apt to kill little boys than girls in their family . " Women with postpartum depression kill their babies , and men may kill babies by shaken baby syndrome , " she explained . She did not " know of any batterers who are helped to commit the murders by their brothers or cousins or other family members . Occasionally , the man 's relatives may be in the house when the murder goes down , but that is quite rare in my experience . " ( n18 ) <p> The press has reported a number of honor killings in the United States , Canada , and Europe . These cases show the killings to be primarily a Muslim-on-Muslim crime . ( See Table 2 , page 64 , and Table 3 , page 66 . ) The victims are largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lesser extent . And , unlike most Western domestic violence , honor killings are carefully planned . The perpetrator 's family may warn the victim repeatedly over a period of years that she will be killed if she dishonors her family by refusing to veil , rebuffing an arranged marriage , or becoming too Westernized . Most important , only honor killings involve multiple family members . Fathers , mothers , brothers , male cousins , uncles , and sometimes even grandfathers commit the murder , but mothers and sisters may lobby for the killing . Some mothers collaborate in the murder in a hands-on way and may assist in the getaway . In some cases , taxi drivers , neighbors , and mosque members prevent the targeted woman from fleeing , report her whereabouts to her family , and subsequently conspire to thwart police investigations. n19 Very old relatives or minors may be chosen to conduct the murder in order to limit jail time if caught . <p> Seldom is domestic violence celebrated , even by its perpetrators . In the West , wife batterers are ostracized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muslims who commit or assist in the commission of honor killings view these killings as heroic and even view the murder as the fulfillment of a religious obligation . A Turkish study of prisoners found no social stigma attached to honor murderers. n20 While advocacy organizations such as CAIR denounce any link between honor killings and Islam , many sheikhs still preach that disobedient women should be punished . Few sheikhs condemn honor killings as anti-Islamic . Honor killings are not stigmatized . <p> In these cases , the average age of the victims was 21.5 , and 10 of the 14 were daughters . Importantly , more than half the cases involved multiple perpetrators . <p> Nor is there a significant difference between honor killings in North America and Europe . Neither the average age ( 20 ) nor the percentage of daughters as victims in the European cases is significantly different from those in the North American cases . ( See Table 3 . ) <p> In both North America and Europe , family members conducted honor killings with excessive violence -- repeatedly stabbing , raping , setting aflame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serial-killing-type scenarios are Western women targeted with similar violence ; in these cases , the perpetrators are seldom family members , and their victims are often strangers . Despite the obfuscation of Muslim advocacy groups , these case studies show that honor killings are quite distinct from domestic violence . Not all honor killings are perpetrated by Muslims , but the overwhelming majority are . Ninety percent of the honor killers shown in Tables 2 and 3 were Muslim . In every case , perpetrators view their victims as violating rules of religious conduct and act without remorse . <p> While the sample size is small , this study suggests that honor killing is accelerating in North America and may correlate with the numbers of first generation immigrants . The problem is diverse but originates with immigration from majority Muslim countries and regions -- the Palestinian territories , the Kurdish regions of Turkey and Iraq , majority Muslim countries in the Balkans , Bangladesh , Egypt , and Afghanistan . Pakistanis account for the plurality . The common denominator in each case is not culture but religion . <p> L : A CONFLICT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Muslims , Sikhs , and Hindus view honor and morality as a collective family matter . Rights are collective , not individual . Family , clan , and tribal rights supplant individual human rights. ( n21 ) <p> In these groups , intellectuals and elites handicap the absorption of immigrants arriving from countries where honor is a communal virtue . For example , accusations of Islamophobia stymie discussion and policy formulation when policymakers seek to address problems occurring among Muslim immigrants . Still , there are legal interventions underway in Europe , home to between twenty and thirty million Muslim immigrants and their descendents , as opposed to perhaps four million in the United States and Canada. n22 Honor-related violence is , therefore , more visible in Europe than in North America . In 2004 , Sweden held an international conference on honor killing , calling for " international cooperation " on the issue . Conference participants concluded : <p> Violence in the name of honor must be combated as an obstacle to women 's enjoyment of human rights . Interpretations of honor as strongly connected with female chastity must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traditions , or religious considerations are invoked to avoid obligations to eradicate violence against women and girls , including violence in the name of honor . Violence against women must be addressed from a rights-based perspective . ... Measures should be taken in the areas of legislation , employment , education , and sexual and reproductive health and rights . Respect for women 's enjoyment of human rights is intrinsically linked to democracy . International conventions must be incorporated into national legislation. ( n23 ) <p> There have since been local conferences in England , France , and Germany . British law enforcement has begun to hide women in a program equivalent to the U.S. Federal witness protection program. n24 Great Britain has passed legislation to empower police to rescue British female citizens whose families have kidnapped and forcibly married them against their will , usually in Pakistan ; the police will return them to Britain if the brides request it . There is a special police unit that deals with the forced , arranged marriages of children. n25 A new movement has also arisen in England , " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , " launched by Maryam Namazie , an advocate opposed to honor killing and other honor-related violence . She has launched this movement to oppose the use of Shari'a courts because they discriminate against women. n26 Additionally , schools in the Netherlands have been asked to be " more alert to honor violence , " n27 following research conducted for the Ministry of Integration . <p> U.S. law enforcement has made tremendous progress over the last forty years on issues related to violence against women . However , there are not yet any shelters for battered Muslim , Hindu , or Sikh girls or women who fear that they will be murdered for honor . A regular shelter for battered women does not specialize in honor killings , nor are there any provisions for foster families -- Muslim or otherwise -- who can protect girls targeted for murder by their biological families . Critics would oppose any such intervention , however , as a form of cultural oppression , for many victims may have to forfeit their identities in order to remain alive . <p> It will be more difficult to save adult Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any regular contact with people outside her immediate family . Only if she survives injuries that require medical attention will she have contact with strangers who may try to help her rescue herself . <p> Religious education may also be necessary . According to this study , 90 percent of honor murders in the West are committed by Muslims against Muslims . The perpetrators may interpret the Qur'an and Islam incorrectly , either for malicious reasons or simply because they are ignorant of more tolerant Muslim exegesis or conflate local customs with religion . <p> Here , Muslim-American and Muslim-Canadian associations might play a role so long as they cease obfuscation and recognize the religious roots of the problem . Now is the time for sheikhs in the United States and Canada to state without qualification that killing daughters , sisters , wives , and cousins is against Islam . A number of feminist lawyers who work with battered women have credited pro-women sheikhs with helping them enormously . Sheikhs should publicly identify , condemn , and shame honor killers . Those sheikhs who resist doing so should be challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement and civil servants must be mindful of which Muslim community activists they seek to engage . Many self-described civil rights organizations -- CAIR or the Islamic Society of North America , for example -- lean towards more radical interpretations of Islam . Groups such as the American Islamic Congress and the American Islamic Forum for Democracy advocate for gender equality and human rights , n28 but because their efforts against radicalism antagonize Saudi Arabia and other sources of funding , they often lack resources . Given alternative funding , they might be willing to assist in an effort to educate Muslims against honor murder . <p> U.S. and Canadian immigration authorities should also be aware of the issue . They should inform potential Muslim immigrants and new Muslim citizens that it is against the law to beat girls and women , that honor killings are crimes , and that both the murderers and their accomplices can and will be charged . Cultural equivalency will provide no excuse as it sometimes does in more permissive societies such as Great Britain and the Netherlands . As long as Islamist advocacy groups continue to obfuscate the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality , women will continue to be killed for honor in the West ; such murders may even accelerate . Unchecked by Western law , their blood will be on society 's hands . <p> L : Footnotes  --  ( n1 ) Citation for honor murders drawn from Ellen Francis Harris , Guarding the Secret : Palestinian Terrorism and a Father 's Murder of his Too-American Daughter ( New York : Scribner , 1995 ) ; James Brandon and Salam Hafez , Crimes of the Community : Honor-Based Violence in the U.K. ( London : The Centre for Social Cohesion , Jan. 2008 ) , p. 13 , 44 ; The Cleveland Plain Dealer , July 22 , 26 , 2000 ; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Sept. 13 , 1999 ; CBC News , Apr. 22 , 2004 , Mar. 1 , 2005 ; The Indian Express ( New Delhi ) , Jan. 30 , 2005 ; The Asian Pacific Post ( Vancouver , B.C. ) , July 24 , 2003 ; Soundvision.com , Sound Vision Foundation , Bridgeview , Ill. , May 6 , 2002 ; The New York Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgetown , Guyana ) , Dec. 3 , 2003 ; Canwest News Service ( Don Mills , Ont . ) , July 8 , 2008 ; The Rochester Chronicle and Democrat , Apr. 25 , 2004 , July 17 , 2008 ; The Washington Times , Jan. 3 , 2008 ; The Dallas Morning News .
