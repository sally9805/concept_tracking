<p> First , look at the phone messages . Steven Spielberg wants to talk ; beep him . Francis Ford Coppola wants to cook him dinner ; RSVP . Harvey Weinstein , the head of Miramax , wants to do lunch . Is Matthew free two Thursdays from now ? <p> This is n't Matthew Broderick . It is n't Matthew McConaughey . Wait . Just a minute . Urgent call . Tom Hanks needs to have a little chat with Matt Damon . <p> Matt Damon ? He might still be in the " Matthew who ? " stage with the public . But in Hollywood , it 's his turn to reign as the It Boy . <p> Damon stars as an idealistic young lawyer who takes on a nasty insurance company in Francis Ford Coppola 's " The Rainmaker , " opening Nov. 21 and based on the John Grisham book . And now Damon could adopt the Morton Salt motto : <p> When it rains , it pours . <p> Offers are flowing in . John Dahl ( " The Last Seduction " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunt for Spielberg in next year 's " Saving Private Ryan . " Last night Coppola cooked for him . <p> " Oh , it was delicious . Olives from his winery . Fresh pasta . The desk from ' The Godfather ' is in his house , " marvels the 27-year-old Damon , who looks like a college kid . Dressed in jeans and a T-shirt , he looks like that handsome guy who used to mow your lawn to earn extra money for school . <p> Damon admits his life has entered a different dimension . " The whole thing seems so weird . Like I 'm living someone else 's life and the identity police are going to say , ' Excuse us , Mr. Damon . Can you step outside ? ' " <p> Well , maybe this story is not so strange . Suddenly it sounds pretty familiar . Handsome young guy . A John Grisham book turned into a movie . His name is Matthew . Hmmm . " Just do n't say that I 'm the next Matthew McConaughey , " wails Damon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be me . " <p> So far , so good . He 's weathering the publicity storm like a trooper without a hint of attitude and a big , sunny smile on his face . <p> Damon , a few credits shy of graduating with an English degree from Harvard , has a brain and brawn . He also has a heart that is beating rather nervously . Take the day he got a call from Coppola , who originally wanted Sean Penn in the lead role for " The Rainmaker . " <p> Damon recalls , " I get this call . ' Hi , it 's Francis . Can you come down to my ranch to screentest for my new picture ? ' On the plane , I 'm freaking out . I did n't sleep all night . " <p> The day after he got " The Rainmaker , " Damon sent Miramax head honcho Harvey Weinstein a fax . " It said , ' Dear Harvey , I am the Rainmaker . Love Matt . ' He called going , ' What the hell does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case so good that money will be raining down . <p> In Damon 's case , he hoped some money would land in his lap from Miramax so he could finally make a film he wrote five years ago with childhood buddy Ben Affleck ( " Chasing Amy " ) called " Good Will Hunting . " The movie , touted as a sure-fire Oscar contender , is due out this December . <p> Damon plays a young genius and janitor from South Boston who wrestles with how he can use his talents and not desert his working-class friends . His relationship with a therapist ( Robin Williams ) changes his life . <p> But back to the story . " A few hours later , I get a call from Harvey . ' Matt , all right . Gus Van Zant will direct your picture . I made the deal . You 're starting the day after ' Rainmaker ' wraps . ' " <p> When you 're hot , you 're hot . <p> Soon Spielberg was calling . " Steven Spielberg was shooting ' Amistad ' for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ' Good Will , ' comes up to me and Ben and says , ' So boys , do you want to meet Steven ? ' We knew exactly who he was talking about . <p> " He took us over . Robin introduced me to Steven . A week later , I was in ' Saving Private Ryan , ' " says Damon . " I was like , ' Um , thank you , Mr. Spielberg . Thank you . Thank you . ' " In the World War II drama starring Tom Hanks due out next year , Damon is a young grunt . He is Private Ryan . <p> That settled , the question still remains : Who is Matt Damon ? <p> Mary Kaye Place , who plays his client in " The Rainmaker , " describes him this way : " I 'm in love with him . The thing that kills me about Matt is that he would work 16 hours a day for five months . I never heard him get irritable or complain . You could see on his little face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to a crew guy . " <p> Claire Danes , who plays his love interest in the film , adds , " I lobbied for Matt to get the role . He 's just a great actor in that real Jimmy Stewart , all-American way . " <p> Or maybe in that Tom Hanks way . " Good Will " has already been described as " Forrest Gump " with a high IQ . Damon got the idea when he was in a writing class at Harvard . Damon and Affleck sat down to write a screenplay . " It sounds very noble , but the truth is we could n't get arrested as actors . So we thought , ' Why do n't we just write our own movie ? ' <p> " At the time Ben was sleeping on my couch in my closet-sized apartment in West Hollywood . He had been engaged and the marriage had been called off . He was out of his house with all his clothes . <p> " We were desperate , " says Damon . Four days after the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damon got a call asking if half a million dollars was enough dough . <p> Was it enough ? He shakes his head . " The big meeting was hilarious . They throw around these figures . The suits are going , ' Boys , we were thinking of half a mil . ' " He giggles . " And Matt and I , who are n't sure if we can afford McDonald 's tonight , are sitting there like , ' Half a mil ? Hmmmm . You do n't say . That 's very interesting . ' " <p> The dynamic duo did n't exactly go Hollywood . " You go from eating Roman fried noodles out of the box to eating real spaghetti . From a box . With a real label . It was amazing , " says Damon . He also bought a four-bedroom house and moved in three more of his friends . <p> Damon always figured he was destined for . . . something . As a boy growing up in Boston , he was encouraged to be creative . The son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV and movies . <p> " Mom did n't want to raise little robots , " says Damon . " When my brother and I were little , she would give us blocks . Mom would say , ' Go make up a game . ' I think it had a big impact on us . <p> " I would fly around the house with a towel on my neck and pretend to be Superman . My brother would make me a bionic arm . <p> " Now I 'm an actor . And he 's an artist and a sculptor . I think the path was set by Mom , " says Damon . He started acting at age 9 in local children 's theater productions . " My parents were n't stage parents . They would never take me to a professional audition . " <p> So when Damon was 16 , he got his own agent . <p> " I was such a moron , " he says . " At that age , I told my mom and my dad that I was ready to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're ready to what ? ' And Ben , who lived around the corner , had an agent in New York because he had done a PBS series when he was a little kid . " <p> Damon admits he was jealous . " He was my best buddy and he had an agent . No fair ! Ben was a big star in my eyes . He was the Harrison Ford of our neighborhood . " He adds , " Ben in his infinite wisdom tells me one day , ' I can get you a meeting with my agent . ' " <p> The only problem ? No dough to get to New York . No driver 's license either . " Finally , Ben and I got a TJ Maxx commercial . They paid me $ 200 . " <p> Affleck and Damon bought two tickets on Amtrak and they were on their way to the " big meeting . " Affleck was 14 ; Damon was 16 . The agent signed him but work only dribbled in . <p> So Damon did the only thing he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up again during his sophomore year when his agent rang . " I was told the president of Touchstone Pictures wanted to meet with me . I 'm screaming , ' Wow ! This is bigger than when I met with the casting agent from the TJ Maxx commercial ! ' " says Damon . " I 've told my entire dorm about my big future at Disney . " <p> Damon hit New York again . He told a receptionist at the Disney building , " ' Hi , I 'm Matt and I 'm meeting the president of Touchstone Pictures . ' She looks at me blankly . I 'm like , ' You know , Matt Damon . I 'm his 3:30 . Matt . M-a-t-t . ' She said , ' Yes , I see Matt Damon . You 're here for the Mickey Mouse Club audition . ' " <p> Damon looked at Affleck , who had the same " meeting . " He shrugs . " We sat down and waited for our chance to be in the Mickey Mouse Club . I danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so embarrassing . <p> " And I did n't make it , " he wails . <p> A year later , he was cast in a bit role as Steamer in " Mystic Pizza . " A small role in " School Ties " as a snobby boarding school boy followed . His big break happened when he lost 40 pounds to play a guilt-ridden , junkie soldier in " Courage Under Fire . " <p> " After ' Courage ' came out , there was a lot of buzz that swirled around . But nothing really happened . My phone did n't ring for six months . " <p> Damon was also sick . To lose the weight , he dined on only egg whites , chicken and veggies for months . Plus he ran more than 13 miles a day . " For a long time whenever I stood , I fainted , " says Damon , who in three weeks of normal eating put all the weight back on . But his problems were n't over . <p> " Soon , I would get flashes of heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sleeping or sitting down . My system was so cranked up and it would n't stop . I 'm still on medicine to control my adrenaline . " <p> Then again , there are other reasons his adrenaline is pumping . He 's dating " someone special who is not an actress . " <p> Best of all , he 's moving out of the " Matt who ? " stage . " The other day , this kid even asked for my autograph , " says the guy who drives a beat-up truck and still lives with his buddies . <p> " I said , ' Kid , do you even know who I am ? ' He said , ' Yeah , you 're Rainman or something . ' " <p> Distributed by Big Picture News Inc.
