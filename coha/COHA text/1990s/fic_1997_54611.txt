How many times since Elise 's death had her husband , Mitch , said numbly , Oh Christ , I ca n't believe she 's gone , I do n't know what to do . And Joan replied helplessly , squeezing his hand , I know ! I know . <p> Of course , there would n't be one  --  a wake . The deceased had n't been Catholic . Had n't been brought up in any church , though she 'd been respectful ( more or less , at least publicly ) of religion . <p> At the time of death , at the time of the terrible starkness and finality of death , when you are staring into an abyss , and no bottom to the abyss , religion is a consolation , for some . If you can believe , if you can force yourself Yes , but we do n't believe , and we ca n't force ourselves . <p> Joan would date the hour , the very minute of Elise 's death at the time she , Joan , received the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Milwaukee ; in fact , Elise had died at 6:55 a.m. in Milwaukee General Hospital . But Joan had picked up the telephone in Baltimore , unguarded and innocent , and immediately she 'd recognized the voice of Elise 's husband , though some terrible change had occurred , Mitch 's voice was quavering , broken . Joan thought , Elise is dead . Elise is dead ! For never in the twelve years of their acquaintance had Mitch telephoned Joan , his wife 's oldest friend . <p> So Joan heard the news from Mitch . " You 're the first to know , except for Elise 's older sister , who 's going to break the news to her mother . " Elise 's mother had been ill for some time , in a nursing home ; Joan had n't seen her in years . " Elise wanted to call you herself . Sunday morning , she was going to try . But she could n't , she was too weak . Joan , are you there ? " Mitch asked anxiously , and Joan said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " thinking numbly , Where else ! Where else would I be/and Mitch continued , " So she told me to tell you , Joan , she was thinking of you , and she 's going to miss you , and  --  " There was a pause , some confusion at the other end of the line , possibly someone was speaking to Mitch , or Mitch had dropped the receiver , and Joan said , " Mitch ? Mitch ? Is something wrong ? " and after a moment Mitch 's voice returned , overly loud in her ear , agitated , " Elise is still  --  her body , I mean-in the hospital . And I 'm here . " <p> Joan said , " I 'll come as quickly as I can . " <p> Joan had forgotten how sick grief can make you . How like a physical blow it was  --  " grief . " A fever , a nausea . Terrible raging anger . <p> So soon ! She was so young  --  thirty-seven . I ca n't believe it . <p> Like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> Always Joan had been just slightly jealous of Elise 's other friends . Girls in high school , boyfriends ; in time , lovers ; one or two men Elise had come close to marrying ; and the man she had married , Mitch  --  Mitchell Caleb Richards . Joan had been jealous of him , and , why not admit it , Joan had been , for years , a little in love with him . Since they 'd been girls , Joan had been secretly drawn to Elise 's men , and Elise had once flattered her by remarking that she , Elise , was drawn to Joan 's men . This was a shock to Joan , and a pleasure : for Elise was a woman of striking looks , tall , golden-haired as a princess in a fairy tale , with an air of inward composure ; in public , people turned to look at her ; when she entered a room , people glanced up smiling , expectant . Yes ? Even my husband ? Are you drawn to my husband , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a moment 's hesitation , oddly shy , Well  --  no . That 's different . But why , Joan wondered , was it different ? <p> It was a fact not to be reduced to any other fact . Elise had died at 6:55 a.m. of April 15 , 1996 , in Milwaukee General Hospital . <p> It had been expected that Elise could not live beyond another eight months , the cancer had been metastasizing so rapidly ; but it had not been expected that Elise would die so soon , of complications arising from kidney failure . <p> Joan could n't help but feel cheated . Tricked . She and Elise had kept in contact by phone , and Joan averaged two or even three calls to Elise 's one , and Elise had owed her a call , or two  --  the last time they 'd spoken had been in mid-March . So Elise 's abrupt death seemed to Joan impulsive , impetuous . For there was that side of her friend , too  --  making up her mind , then changing it ; changing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee on an early-evening flight , saying goodbye to her husband and her children , who were ten and seven , telling them she 'd be back on Saturday evening , after the funeral . She believed herself to be , in their eyes , reasonably calm , contained . <p> Then , on the flight , she began to cry . Embarrassing herself , and others . And how strange , that crying should make her perspire inside her clothes , at an altitude of thirty thousand feet . A flight attendant tried to comfort her , but damned if Joan , any more than Elbe would have done , would confess before strangers she was mourning a death , the death of her oldest , closest friend ; she was a mature , unsentimental woman , the kind of woman who comforts others and does not break down herself . And thirtyseven years old  --  not young . She told the flight attendant , " It 's hay fever . A virulent form of hay fever . That 's all . " <p> Then at the Milwaukee airport there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to recognize Elise 's husband , for whom she 'd had vague romantic yearnings for twelve years , while Milch , waiting at the gate , anxious , eager , seemed to fail to recognize , at first , his wife 's friend Joan , though he 'd driven to the airport expressly to meet her . Of course , they would laugh about it afterward . <p> Mitch was smelling of grief , too . Stronger and ranker than Joan 's . Possibly he had n't showered , changed his clothes , in some time . <p> Joan had seen a ravaged man who might have been any age between thirty and fifty ( Mitch was in fact thirty-nine ) . With a thrown-together look  --  rumpled clothes , a soiled Milwaukee Brewers cap jammed onto his head and water-stained running shoes on his feet . His jaws covered in two days ' gray-glinting stubble and his eyes red-veined , with a glassy sheen . He 'd been drinking , but Joan had n't known that at the time . His mouth looked as if it had been mashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , to take her roughly in his arms in an anguished embrace , Joan felt a panicked impulse to lift her elbows in self-defense . <p> It was on the drive to the hotel that Mitch said , several times , as if he 'd forgotten what he 'd said only a few minutes before , Oh Christ , I ca n't believe she 's gone , I do n't know what to do . And Joan replied helplessly , I know ! I know . These words were in acknowledgment of the impoverishment of all words , at such a time ; yet , what choice had they , who 'd loved Elise , except to repeat them ? And repeat them . <p> Mitch announced to loan that he could n't do the obituary , please would she do the obituary ? Elise would have wished that . And would she select a photograph of Elise from their photo album ? And here was the number to call  --  Mitch 's hand was visibly shaking  --  at The Milwaukee Times-Ledger . <p> Next day , Joan accompanied Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements for the funeral , signed a letter of agreement , and handed over a check , then they drove to a nearby Safeway since there was virtually no food in the house  --  Joan had checked the refrigerator on a hunch , the glaring white emptiness and a smell of something overripe and rancid had been a shock . Elise would have been embarrassed , upset . Clearly , something has happened here ! This would appear to be a refrigerator in a household in which something has happened . <p> In the Safeway , Joan did most of the selecting , and Joan pushed the cart , one wheel of which had begun to stick . There was Mitch staring at pyramids of organic carrots , and satiny-purple eggplants that looked as if they 'd been lacquered , and red-leaf lettuces arranged like works of art ; he looked like a sleepwalker slow to awaken , by lights bright and unsparing as on a movie set . He turned to look for Joan , panic in his face , as if she 'd left him ; Joan smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying , " There 's this terror I 've had all my life , that I 'll lose the names of things . Not just the things but what they are . Like a stroke victim . For instance , what the hell is this ? Am I supposed to know ? " Mitch lifted a pale squash shaped like an Indian club , gripping the stem . Was this meant to be a joke ? Joan said , " I think it 's a butternut squash . But we do n't want it , we 're sticking to essentials . " " And what 's this ? " Mitch lifted a torpedo-shaped vegetable that resembled Chinese cabbage , glittering with moisture . " Fresh anise , " Joan said . Mitch said , " ' Fresh anise '  --  how do you know ? " Joan said , pointing , " Because it says so on the sign  --  ' Fresh anise . ' " " Right you are , " Mitch said , with affable irony . " The sign explains everything . " <p> Joan pushed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shopping cart , but Mitch lost patience , saying , " Let me help you with that damned thing ! " and would have wrested it from her except Joan quickly intervened . " No ! It 's fine . We 're almost finished . " She had a vision of Mitch shoving and jerking the cart , cursing , slamming it into a food display . He was flexing his fingers as if yearning to do violence ; tears shone angrily in his eyes . Joan had been taking aspirin to dull her anxiety , and she guessed , smelling Mitch 's breath , that he 'd been drinking . She said pleasantly , " I noticed , Mitch  --  you 're out of eggs . " As if eggs were the only item Mitch was out of . <p> Mitch laughed . " Fuck eggs . I can live without eggs . " <p> In the dairy products section of the store , steam lifted thinly from open refrigerated units . Joan began to shiver . Mitch said , " This place ! Like a morgue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she knew to be contorted , ugly , " Yes ! But we 're almost finished . " Her eyes smarted from the overly bright colors , waxen containers , food packages stamped with the giddy-smiling faces of cartoon animals . How by quick degrees , during the course of her own lifetime , the world had become a place of cartoon animals , Disney creatures wanting us to buy , buy , buy . Mitch seemed to be reading her thoughts ; as , when they were girls , Elise had sometimes seemed to read Joan 's thoughts ; he spoke with an edge to his voice that made other customers glance at him , " Joan , d' you think this is  --  all there is ? The surfaces of things ? Looks , smells ? And there 's nothing more ? " Joan said brightly , " Butter ? Skim milk ? Cheddar cheese ? " She was flinging items into the cart . Milch had n't been eating at home for days , perhaps had n't been eating regularly at all . He 'd lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young face , with an older face laid upon it like a gauze mask . His eyes had become starker , larger . And there was a new way he had of laughing without mirth , baring his teeth like a dog . Joan thought , Without Elise between us , I do n't know this man . She would have liked to have left the shopping cart in the Safeway and returned to her hotel , but there seemed no way to negotiate such a maneuver . Mitch was saying , " Elise was a vegetarian , y'know . Helluva lot of good it did her , eh ? " Joan said , incensed , " Elise was not a vegetarian ! Since when ? " " She 'd quit smoking , and she 'd quit ' red meat " She was on some sort of desperate brown rice and greens diet . In addition to the chemotherapy . She did n't tell you ? That 's strange . I thought she told you everything . " Joan said , disliking the tone of their conversation , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laughed at that . You know what Elise was like . " Joan dropped a container of yogurt into the shopping cart , more carelessly than she intended . <p> Mitch said in a neutral voice , " What Elise was like  --  when ? At the end , or when we knew her ? " <p> Joan had n't wanted to think about that . She had n't seen Elise 's body , of course . There would n't be an open casket at the funeral service on Saturday morning . There would be no wake  --  no " viewing . " <p> Maybe death is n't real if you do n't see the body . If you ca n't touch the body . If there is n't any body . <p> Joan had had a difficult time selecting a photograph of Elise to accompany the obituary . A smiling face , a radiantly happy face , is inappropriate for such circumstances , and nearly all of Elise 's photographs depicted her smiling . She 'd finally chosen a photograph that had been professionally taken , in which Elise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious ; an attractive woman , yet not , somehow , " Elise "  --  not as they 'd known her . When Joan showed the photo to Mitch , to ask his opinion of it , Mitch had glanced quickly at it , and away . Okay , yes , fine . That 's fine . <p> While they 'd been shopping in the Safeway , though it was only 5:30 p.m. , the sky of massed storm clouds had darkened nearly to night . A harsh wind rose from the direction of Lake Michigan : Joan could imagine the lake whipped to a frenzy . On one of her early visits to Elise and Mitch , Elise had driven Joan along the lakefront at a time when a gale was rising ; the lake had seemed an inland sea , immense , astonishing . Mitch suddenly began to shiver ; then , as if losing control , he began to shake with cold ; his teeth were audibly chattering , panic shone in his eyes . Joan moved to him , to steady him . She tried to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery bags , too bulky ; they stumbled together . Joan said quickly , " Get in the car , I 'll start the heater " Mitch was trying to speak , but his jaws seemed locked . Joan took the bags from him , and Joan took his car keys out of his pocket , and Joan helped him , this stricken , near-convulsing man , into the passenger 's seat . She started the motor , turned on the heater . " You 'll be all right . You 'll be fine . Just do n't think about being cold . Try not to think about being cold . Here  --  here 's the heat . Feel it ? You 'll be fine . " <p> By degrees , Mitch 's shivering began to subside . His lips were a ghastly purplish-blue , his face clammy-pale . Of course , he was deeply ashamed , humiliated , trying to explain or apologize , but Joan said for God 's sake just be still , be calm , try to relax . She 'd drive . <p> Lucky for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been erratic , dangerous . The evening before , driving her back to the city from the airport , he 'd talked , gestured , removing his hands from the wheel . He could n't seem to comprehend the fact of Elise 's death , let alone the fact he no longer had a wife . He had n't been sleeping , he 'd admitted , for several days . He 'd been afraid that , if he slept , Elise might die ; and something like that had happened . Joan had been terrified , several times , they 'd have an accident  --  and at such a time . <p> How disruptive , death was . The death of someone powerfully loved . It simply could not be factored in . <p> When they returned to Mitch 's house , it was to discover it darkened , and the rear door , leading from the garage into the house , unlocked . <p> Mitch muttered he must be losing his grip , forgetting to lock up . And he 'd rushed out , to get to the funeral home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joan switched on lights , uncomfortable with the look of disorder , confusion in the house which , while Elise had been alive , had been spotless . And how strange to be in this house without Elise beside her , or calling to her from another room . Elise in the living room , Elise in the kitchen . Elise saying , Joan ! It 's great to see you again , I 've been missing you . Elise had been a woman who 'd liked to squeeze your hand , hug you , laugh with delight at her own happiness . How strange to think she would not be rushing into the room , surprised at Joan 's visit . Joan ? Mitch ? What 's up ? What 's going on ? <p> Joan blinked in dismay , almost in a kind of vertigo , seeing the mess in which Mitch had been living . As if a storm had blown through the downstairs . In the living room with its wall of sliding glass doors and its elegant cathedral ceiling , there were scattered newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase which Joan recognized as an old gift of hers containing very dead , very blackened roses . A trail of dirt on the beige carpet . Tosseddown articles of clothing . And that sour odor of bodily grief <p> Earlier , brought to the house by Mitch , Joan had done some hurried picking-up , but there was much more to do . How embarrassed , how angry Elise would be at the look of her beautiful house . As if it had begun to disintegrate , decay . As if all vigilance had been withdrawn from it . Oh Christ , I miss her so , Mitch was saying . I want her back . I ca n't believe she 's gone . <p> In the kitchen , Mitch was banging about , setting a grocery bag down on a cluttered table , and immediately the bag overturned , items spilled out . Mitch cursed and kicked a grapefruit across the floor . <p> How strange , how unnatural to be alone in this house , Elise 's house , in the company of Elise 's husband , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frightened of Elise 's husband . <p> Wondering , How will we get through it ! The days until the funeral . The nights . The next hour . <p> Quickly Joan began to put things away  --  into the refrigerator , on cupboard shelves . Then she rinsed plates , glasses , cutlery ; stacked the dishwasher and set it going , a high humming sound of consolation . Mitch hovered about , leaving the kitchen and returning , seeming to want to help but not knowing how , his hands clumsy . He offered Joan a drink , which she declined . He opened a can of lukewarm beer , foam dripped onto his knuckles . He 'd been telling Joan a complicated tale of tenderness and irony about something that had occurred just before Elise had had to be hospitalized this last time , but he was interrupted by a ringing telephone ; he let it ring , and ring ; seeing the look of concern on Joan 's face ( for certainly the call was an urgent one from a relative , a friend , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessly that the answering service would pick it up  --  " Like all the others . " Joan did n't want to ask how many others . Mitch had n't removed his baseball cap , which was twisted on his head . He wore a gray pullover sweater damp beneath the arms and across the back . The stubble on his jaws seemed to have grown sharper in the past hour , and there was a fleck of something white , like dried toothpaste , in a corner of his mouth . He was staring at Joan contemplatively . Joan suggested she might answer some of the calls , and there was the obituary to finish and telephone in to the newspaper , but Mitch shook his head as if to clear it and said no , not right now  --  " Let 's relax right now . " The phone had ceased ringing . The house thrummed with silence , but it was an uneasy silence buffeted by wind , a high tolling sound above the roof ; there was a pressure against the windows like the soft slapping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , " Mitch said slowly , bitterly , " but I did n't get it , she would actually vanish . And just the body left behind . And that body not the one we knew . All that  --  that had n't sunk in , somehow . Though Elise is n't the first person I 've known who has died . Of course not . But  --  " So Mitch talked , talked . <p> If they 'd had children , Joan was thinking . Maybe that would make some difference , now . <p> For the next forty minutes as Joan cleaned the downstairs of Elise 's house , too restless , too nervous to sit still , Mitch followed her about , telling her a complicated story of how , thirteen years and three months before , he 'd met Elise on New Year 's Day , in Chicago ; and how , the following year , they 'd re-met on New Year 's Eve , in New York ; how they 'd obviously been fated to meet . Joan knew the story well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is a lifetime , what are friendships that stretch through lifetimes , but the accumulation of favorite , much-repeated stories ? In fact , Joan had been a guest at the New Year 's party in New York , at the home of mutual college friends , and she 'd been introduced to Mitch , too , at that time ; but Mitch was n't remembering . <p> I might have fallen in love with you then . And you with me . <p> If that had happened , we 'd call it " fate . " <p> Mitch was on his second , possibly his third can of beer . He 'd stopped shivering , though he was still shaky ; his face had become ruddy , splotched . He spoke in a rapid , excited voice , and he moved his arms in wide and exaggerated gestures . Mania , Joan thought . She wondered if it was contagious . Certainly there was something erotic , sexual in it  --  such energy , certainty . Mitch was smiling peculiarly . It was a beat or two before Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elise and I moved in together , in Hyde Park , my last year of law school we gave each other a lot of grief , those days . I always wondered , if she 'd been completely faithful to me . " <p> Joan was shocked . " Mitch , for God 's sake . " <p> " What ? For God 's sake '  --  what ? Just tell me . " Mitch was smiling harder with his mouth , but his eyes stared , red-veined and glassy . <p> Evasively Joan said , " That was  --  a long time ago , Mitch . " <p> " No . Hardly twelve years . A flash . " He snapped his fingers , and the sound was loud , jarring as something broken . " Just tell me was Elise completely faithful to me , or was she involved with that guy , that French economist at the university , remember ? The one who  --  " <p> " If you wanted to know , you should have asked Elise . " <p> Mitch screwed up his face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cruelly Joan thought , Because Elise would have told you , yes ? <p> She said , meaning to comfort him , this warm , despairing man who was crowding her , " Mitch , you 're exhausted . You have n't eaten all day , and you have n't been sleeping , and you are n't thinking coherently . Let me make us something to eat , and I 'll go back to the hotel , and you can sleep , and in the morning  --  " <p> Mitch said , miserably , " It ca n't wait until morning . How can I get through it  --  to morning . Joan , help me , I 'm just trying to know what I should feel . " <p> The dishwasher was still humming , clicking ; going through its cycle . And the wind . And a telephone ringing , unless it was a ringing in Joan 's head . She felt dazed , dizzy . A terrible sensation of exhaustion swept over her , but she would not give in to it . <p> Years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I 've loved any man , but I 've loved other men I might have been happy with , too . Is that a terrible thing to admit ? <p> Elise had confided in Joan , If you do n't have children , like Mitch and me , you 're in danger of remaining a child yourself all your life . <p> " What should you feel ? " Joan said . " Exactly what you feel . " <p> Impulsively  --  for this was a gesture of Elise 's  --  Joan took hold of Mitch 's trembling hands , and briskly rubbed them , and steadied them . She removed the sweat-stained baseball cap from his head . His graying brown hair stood up in short spikes . His forehead was creased in wavering horizontal lines . Joan said firmly , " You 'll get through it , Mitch . Of course you will . " The phone rang , and this time Joan went to answer it ; it was a Milwaukee friend of Elise 's , a woman not known to Joan , who 'd just heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about someone you love dying , Joan , when the girls were fifteen , when Elise 's father died unexpectedly of a heart attack , is n't just the person is gone forever and you 'll never see him again , but time keeps going , like nothing special happened after all . It just keeps .. , going . <p> Here was a shocking thing , which Joan did n't intend to tell Mitch  --  The Milwaukee Times-Ledger charged for obituaries unless the deceased was a person of prominence ; a " newsworthy person already in our files , " <p> Joan had worked at the obituary for over an hour , composing it painstakingly , by hand ; less than three hundred words , and her eyes smarted , her head throbbed , her fingers were stiff and clumsy as if arthritic . Mitch had provided her with the facts of Elise 's life , birth date , birthplace , parents ' names , lists of schools Elise had attended and degrees earned , jobs , activities , affiliations , the exact title of Elise 's most recent position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts Joan herself had provided ; but it was the organization of these facts that gave her difficulty . She could not seem to think . She transposed and misspelled words . She had to stop several times to walk about , nearly overcome by sorrow , dread , nausea . Bright , vivid Elise ! Beautiful Elise ! Joan 's friend of nearly thirty years , closer to her than any sister , reduced to a brief column of newsprint and a small photo in the back pages of a daily newspaper . <p> No wonder Mitch had been too upset to compose the obituary himself . When Joan asked him to check it for errors , he glanced through it quickly , told her it was fine , and handed it back . <p> So Joan called in the obituary , to learn that there was a charge for obituaries . As the bored-sounding , youngish woman at the other end of the line said , tactlessly , it seemed to Joan , the rate was the same as for classified ads . Unless the deceased was " newsworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think that 's a cruel policy . I think it 's selfish . I do n't understand it at all . " The woman at the other end of the line said mechanically , as if she 'd recited the words countless times , " Because there are so many deaths , ma'am . Every day . Not just in the city but in this part of Wisconsin . The paper has to charge . " <p> So Joan paid for Elise 's obituary with her Visa card , two hundred eighty-eight dollars , reading the numbers over the phone with barely controlled emotion . At least , Mitch would never know . <p> Somehow it was late , almost nine o'clock by the time Joan finally prepared a meal , scrambled eggs and Canadian bacon , sourdough bread , Campbell 's minestrone soup and cheddar cheese and Rye-Crisp crackers , which Mitch and she ate at the kitchen table . Joan was both dazed with hunger and mildly nauseated ; Mitch was ravenous , but now drinking wine , glass after glass . Joan agreed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea , not in the condition they were in . It was n't a good idea , but there she was drinking . Mitch had hurriedly shaved , and might have washed , a bit ; he 'd changed his soiled sweater for another sweater . Small patches of stubble remained on his jaws amid tiny razor nicks and scratches . His eyes were badly bloodshot but bright , alert . He finished the food on his plate and continued to eat compulsively , chunks of cheddar cheese , crackers , and bread , without seeming to taste what he was chewing . When Joan suggested that he go to bed , she 'd call a cab and return to the hotel and see him in the morning , he panicked , grabbed her arm- " No ! Do n't leave , Joan . You ca n't leave . " Joan managed to extricate her arm from Mitch 's fingers , which were strong , blunt fingers , leaving dull marks on her skin . Carefully she said , " You have to sleep , Mitch . You 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have risen to carry plates to the sink , but Mitch prevented her . He said , " We used to talk sometimes , Elise and me , about dying together . I do n't mean suicide , I mean  --  dying , together . We said we would n't want to live without each other . We  --  " Under other circumstances , Joan would have been embarrassed to be told such a confidence ; she would not have wished to be told such a confidence ; now she said , laying a steadying hand on Mitch 's arm , " Mitch , you do n't want to be thinking that way . Not now . " She recalled how in the aftermath of passion , many years ago , she and her young husband had uttered such things to each other ; had seemed to be making vows ; and how touching , how sad and silly such words now seemed , like the utterances of children . Mitch said , " I do n't want to think that way . But it 's hard not to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine into his glass , and into Joan 's . <p> With a part of her mind , Joan was calculating how she 'd get up from the table and telephone a taxi , because Mitch was n't in any condition to drive her home ; nor was she in any condition to drive Elise 's car to the hotel . But Mitch kept her there , talking urgently , anxiously . It was clear he was terrified of being alone . Outside , the wind was stronger ; tiny pellets of ice were being flung against the windows . Joan was in fact on her feet , but Mitch was holding her ; he was embracing her , and groaning ; clutching at her for his very life . Joan could n't breathe . She pushed at him , gently . But then she was leading him out of the kitchen , and upstairs . In the bedroom that had been Elise and Mitch 's , there was that same air of disorder , of something gone wrong . Scattered clothes , towels . A stale smell . A smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took a bath , Mitch . A hot bath . Maybe you could sleep , then " <p> So they prepared a bath for Mitch , running noisy hot water into a tub . Joan was reminded of her children 's baths , when they were younger : the playful comfort , the ritual : the safe conclusion of a day . Mitch insisted upon keeping the bathroom door ajar so that they could talk . Joan agreed ; Joan was quickly changing the bedclothes on the large double bed that had been Elise and Mitch 's ; as Mitch called out to her , Joan responded as she might have responded to one of her children  --  " Yes , that 's right . Oh yes . Yes  --  " She pushed soiled sheets , pillowcases , towels and underwear and socks of Mitch 's into an already stuffed clothes hamper . Who would be doing this laundry ? she wondered . Elise had had a cleaning woman , of course . Though maybe Joan would do the laundry herself , tomorrow . Though people died agonizing deaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though others were deranged with grief , though grief was bitter and unexpected as bile in the mouth , yet laundry must be done , dishes must be washed , clothes shaken and hung up neatly on hangers . On a chair amid layers of tossed-down clothing , Joan discovered a white cotton knit sweater of Elise 's . She snatched it up to her chest with a little cry of pain  --  " Oh . God . " The appalling realization swept upon her as if for the first time , she would never see Elise again . <p> The bedroom was fragrant and warm with steam . Mitch was out of his bath , in a terry-cloth robe , barefoot . His hair was damp-combed , and his face flushed with a look of being out of focus , like melting wax . Joan said goodnight , but Mitch gripped her begging her , not to leave just yet  --  " Please ! Please . " They were sitting together on the edge of the bed . Joan had put fresh sheets and pillowcases on the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own ; she 'd folded a downy comforter neatly at the foot of the bed . Joan said , ' I wo n't leave you , Mitch , but you have to sleep . Will you try to sleep ? " It seemed that they were lying together on top of the bed , awkwardly . Mitch was groaning , pulling at clothing ; he tried to kiss her ; pressed his damp , hungry mouth against her , groaning . He thinks I 'm Elise , Joan thought . There 's no harm to it to it . At first she neither resisted the man nor did she respond ; she was apprehensive , excited ; sexually excited ; as in a confusing dream , she experienced emotions that seemed not entirely her own , arising from a source she could not have identified . With a thrill of guilt , she recalled that she had n't telephoned her husband and her children that evening , as she 'd promised . She had meant to call them from the hotel . She 'd last spoken with her husband that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation ; she could scarcely recall her husband ; there was a sense in which all husbands were interchangeable , as bodies may be interchangeable , considered as anatomical specimens . Mitch was saying what sounded like I ca n't make it , I ca n't make it , and again Joan assured him she would n't leave him . Mitch 's body was heavy , and very warm ; his skin burned , touching hers ; he 'd pulled at Joan 's clothes , and Joan had pulled at her clothes , until they were naked together , and one of them , it must have been Joan , had drawn a sheet over them . Joan was breathing quickly , she felt the man 's penis against her thighs , she felt him begin to pump his groin against her ; felt him getting hard , or nearly ; he was sobbing , groaning as if in pain . His weight on her collarbone was considerable . She was having difficulty breathing . She thought , I will have to go through with it . She was kissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comforting him . His mouth , his tongue . As Elise would have done . He was saying , I love you ! Love you , and she was saying , I love you , I wo n't leave you . He nudged his knee between hers ; she stroked his muscular back , his thighs ; she held his penis , which was warm , and soft ; their faces were damp with perspiration . Mitch was sobbing quietly , and Joan held him as by quick degrees sleep overtook him ; his limbs began to twitch ; several times he kicked , as if he were tripping ; but she held him tight , he did n't fall . Icy rain continued to be blown against the window almost in a rhythm , a discernible rhythm . Joan recalled how when the biopsy had come back from the laboratory , this would have been more than a year ago , Elise had called her , I 'm calling you first , you 're the first to know . Oh Joan ! Yet she could not remember what she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping down a steep incline . She fell into a heavy exhausted sleep like one at the bottom of a pit . Waking open-mouthed as a drowning fish , her throat parched , at two a.m. , not knowing where she was ; her right arm aching and humbed from the weight of a man close beside her , his limbs entwined with hers ; too exhausted to move from the bed except to detach herself carefully from the heavy perspiring man who slept beside her , breathing in harsh , arhythmic swaths of air ; she knew this man was Elise 's husband , yet she seemed not to recall his name , nor could she recall why she was with him , the two of them naked ; though understanding This is a man I once loved . Yet simultaneously she was sitting in warm sunshine , and her young husband was bringing her a baby snugly wrapped in a sky-blue blanket , to set in her lap ; they were outdoors , on a flagstone terrace ; the sight of her young husband 's smiling face , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break ; yet she could n't remember which of her children this baby was , and really she could n't see her husband 's face . For it might have been Elise 's husband who brought her the baby . It might have been Elise herself , for as girls they 'd talked about babies , having babies , would you be brave enough to have a baby , I do n't think I would be , I 'm afraid , yes , but  --  if you were in love ? Maybe that makes a difference ? <p> Joan woke for a second time at 5:38 a.m . And the light in the bedroom still burning . Her head was throbbing violently from the red wine , her throat so dry she could scarcely swallow . She was sweaty , exhausted . Yet what relief that it was morning ; at last , it was morning ; and Elise 's husband still sleep beside her , rolled onto his back now , in a deep stuporous sleep , mouth slack , snoring . Joan slipped from the bed and drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and switched off the bedside lamp and went downstairs to quickly dress , and call a taxi to take her to the hotel ; and when at 6:15 a.m. the taxi 's headlights turned ghostly and silent into the driveway , out of a pale , predawn twilight thick with mist , Joan quietly left the darkened and locked house , left the sleeping man  --  what relief ! what happiness ! They 'd gotten through the night . This was their achievement , Mitch 's and hers , and they 'd done it together-they 'd gotten through the night . And never would they need to speak of it , even to each other . They 'd gotten through the night . <p> <p> By JOYCE CAROL OATES <p>
