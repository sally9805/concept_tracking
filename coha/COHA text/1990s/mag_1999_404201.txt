With millions for charity to her credit , this sister knows our gifts can give us a say By Robin D. Stone Photograph Fund-raiser Cheryl D. Polk left ) shares her time and computer expertise with 10year-old Demeitra Williams at Girls , Inc. , of St. Louis . // ASK CHERYL D. POLK TO RAISE $100,000 for a good cause and , without blinking , she 's likely to answer , " When do you need it ? " You could say this sister has goodwill in her genes : She 's following her parents ' lead . " Every day I saw my father giving-helping his church , his community , our family , " says Polk , remembering her childhood days when her dad , pastor of New Light Baptist Church in Omaha , was often called away from his family to tend to his congregation . And Polk 's mom balanced the roles of preacher 's wife , full-time worker and mother of seven . Today the grown-up Polk , a 36-year-old mother of three , is part of a wave of sisters and brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiere fund-raiser in St. Louis , Missouri , she calls on friends , colleagues and corporate heads to dig into their pockets and company coffers and support good works . In addition to handling her regular job as director of donor services for the American Red Cross , Polk has worked to raise more than $3 million for organizations like the Girl Scouts and the United Way . " United Way is better because of Cheryl , and the community is better , " says Charmaine Chapman , president and CEO of the United Way of Greater St. Louis . Polk joined United Way in 1993 as a " leadership giver , " one who donates $1,000 or more . Then she began calling on Blacks to give to the organization . Her fund-raising track record was so goodshe won several awards-that at one time the United Way employed her as a consultant . Why does she give so much to charity ? " Too often people of color are highlighted as recipients of services , but not as contributors , " Polk says with a saleswoman 's pitch that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to be part of the leadership of organizations that impact our communities . " &gt; More of us are getting that message . The number of African-American donors is rising , largely because of increased wealth in our community and a widening of the gap between rich and poor , philanthropy experts say . As giving declined from 77 to 73 percent among Whites and from 65 to 57 percent among Hispanics , Black household contributions to charities rose from 51 percent in 1993 to 53 percent in 1995 , according to the latest survey by the Independent Sector , a group that tracks giving in the United States . And the poorest are the most generous : Americans with household incomes of $10,000 and under gave about 4.3 percent of their incomes to charity . Now philanthropy experts are encouraging us to go one step further-to give strategically . We can do that by donating to the causes that benefit Blacks and by demanding a say in how our money is used . Are You a Responsible Giver ' ' ? If anyone knows about giving , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in church and mutual aid societies to feed , clothe and even free other Blacks . In our 200-year tradition of philanthropy , we have given more to our churches than to any other cause , funding everything from scholarships and insurance funds to burial funds , says Black philanthropy scholar Emmett D. Carson , who is the president and CEO of The Minneapolis Foundation , which promotes philanthropy in the Twin Cities . " There was a time when most of our giving was prompted by crisis , " in response to emergencies , oppression and disasters , says Carson . He Today our giving is more often prompted by a desire to ensure that our organizations-like the National Urban League , the National Black United Fund , the United Negro College Fund and the NAACP-can help our people in the coming years . The next step , Carson says , is for Blacks to become " responsible givers " - to feel a sense of ownership of the organizations we help . " As a responsible giver , I 'm going to ask for annual reports and go to meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have we accomplished ? How does one join the board of this organization ? ' As you become involved , an organization will start to reflect your concerns . " Active involvement will be the message at the second National Conference on Black Philanthropy , a gathering of individuals and organizations-the National Black United Fund and the WK . Kellogg Foundation , for instance-seeking to increase giving among Blacks . Rodney Jackson , the conference organizer , says hundreds are expected at the next gathering on May 17-19 in Oakland ( call 888 5573593 for more information ) . Attendees will hear from speakers on topics like raising money and setting up special funds such as church endowments . Giving : Pass It On Cheryl Polk could teach even the busiest among us something about giving . Each day she squeezes eight or so calls for pledges between meetings and other business at the Red Cross . She still finds time for her children , Clarissa , 11 , Catherine , 8 , and 5-year-old Charles , III , thanks to her husband , Charles Polk , Jr. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferry the kids to and from school and activities . Their household is infused with the spirit of giving that Cheryl knew as a child . She has a standing date with a classroom at Beaumont High to talk about opportunities beyond high school . Charles mentors boys , and he is so active in the Greater Mount Carmel Church in St. Louis that he goes by the nickname Deacon Polk . The Polk children send letters and cards to sick members of their church and visit nursing homes . The family also gives money to the organizations Cheryl serves . But Cheryl feels her time and expertise-she now teaches the art of raising money-are best used teaching others to do for themselves . // Give It Up for Big Givers ! // " I 'm often asked to volunteer or serve on various boards of directors , not because I 'm tied to a large corporation that can contribute financially but because I am a doer , " she says . Her parents , the Reverend Raymond Hill and Viola Hill , should be proud . 0 Sidebar Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?
