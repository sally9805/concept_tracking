<p> An Internal Revenue Service employee named Noble M. Price breaks for lunch , loads a pipe full of his favorite tobacco and ambles over to watch some men sweatily assembling a red metal thing outside the brand-new federal building in New Carrollton . <p> " Excuse me , guys , what is that ? " Price wants to know . <p> " A sculpture , " says the man on the ladder . <p> " What is it supposed to represent ? " Price asks , puffing his pipe . <p> " Whatever it represents to you . " <p> Price nods contemplatively and angles his gaze at the 12-foot-high structure . " Who did it ? " <p> " I did , " Fred Eversley says proudly , and climbs down the ladder . Adjusting his construction apron , he explains how light is meant to be caught , prismlike , in the clear acrylic layers wedged between the painted aluminum triangles . It 's all about energy . <p> Price , 61 , a museum lover , takes a closer look and heartily agrees : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I really do . " <p> This often happens when Eversley , an abstract sculptor , erects his public projects . Some people are confused ; many are intrigued ; most are appreciative . Overall they behave just like art critics . <p> What kind of aesthetic should be foisted upon the public by its government ? The sunny plaza outside this $ 145 million office complex ( connected by a skywalk to the New Carrollton Metro stop ) turns out to be a good place to ask the question . The nature of public art is changing . Eversley , who left aerospace engineering to pursue an art career 30 years ago , has survived the sometimes bitter feuds . He 's not famous , but he works steadily , keeping studios in Venice , Calif. , and New York 's SoHo . He 's admired , and he 's never changed his approach . <p> His pieces are clean and fluid , often suggestive of flight . He was the first artist in residence at the National Air and Space Museum . His stainless steel parabolas grace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polyester discs survived the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City ( rescuers found it under the rubble , " essentially undamaged , " he says ) . His works are purchased by mall developers and hotel chains , private collectors and public ones , such as the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board . <p> " I believe an artist has a responsibility to the public , " he says . " Good art talks to and involves its audience . You want to have some kind of dialogue with the observer . And I hope it 's a happy dialogue . " <p> The artist himself is an incessant talker with an engaging biography . He helped design laboratories at the Houston space center that sent rockets to the moon ; used to hang out with Daniel Ellsberg ( pre-Pentagon Papers , when he was at Rand Corp. ) ; lived next door to a poet named Jim Morrison , who founded the Doors . Fifty-five years old , graying at the temples , he is n't ashamed to use the adjective " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes pride in his white , black , Native American and East Indian blood  --  " Baby , I 'm the whole megillah . " <p> But he wo n't bow to the multi-culti dictates of politically correct art . He recently lost two commissions for sculptures in cities honoring Martin Luther King Jr . " The community wanted black Mount Rushmores  --  they wanted him standing there with a Bible in his hand , " he says . " That 's the end of the game for me . " His proposals involved a 5,000-pound black granite sphere . <p> But public memorials often rely on heroic , hortatory art : The newly opened Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial serves as Exhibit A. The public is thought to prefer hulking bronzes and direct messages . Throw in a cute dog and a wheelchair , too , so that absolutely nothing is left to the tourists ' imagination . ( Never mind that two of the most compelling pieces on the Mall  --  the Washington Monument and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial  --  can be viewed as pure abstraction . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbue his art with their own ideas  --  that he rarely names his sculptures . " I found out a long , long time ago that the public comes up with better titles than I could ever dream of , " he says . <p> Twenty years ago , Eversley 's approach might have generated controversy . What do the two spiraling , winglike objects set in a black reflecting pool in front of the New Carrollton building have to do with the earnest business of government ? <p> In the ' 70s and ' 80s , artists were known to impose their visions on public spaces  --  one famously hostile example being Richard Serra 's " Tilted Arc , " a 120-foot-long wall of steel that dissected Manhattan 's Federal Plaza until protests forced the government to remove it . Today , community groups and arts agencies are more involved in the selection process . <p> Yet there is much tongue-wagging derision during lunch time at the New Carrollton federal building , home to some 4,000 employees . It 's not over Eversley 's unassuming piece , but the monumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passersby as " The Hands . " <p> Near the building 's entrance , Washington sculptor Larry Kirkland erected two granite-and-marble towers , then topped them with six-foot-high hands . One hand displays an open palm , " the gesture of voting or oath-taking , " according to a statement released by Kirkland 's studio . The other has a raised index finger , " the gesture of a speaker or someone giving an opinion . " The towers are engraved with quotes about free speech and other democratic ideals . Nearby sits a 10-foot-high black pyramid engraved with the Constitution . <p> All this sends a message about citizenship , says the General Services Administration , which commissions art from a set-aside of 0.5 percent of a project 's total construction budget . ( The GSA paid Kirkland $ 400,000 to make his sculpture and Eversley got $ 158,000 ; the sums also cover materials . ) <p> Unlike Eversley 's sculpture , Kirkland 's had to bear the burden of strongly denoting a formal federal presence . However , the work could not directly comment on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant is the IRS . <p> You might say that the Kirkland piece demonstrates what happens when public art gets too , well , heavy-handed . For some IRS workers , the hands have become symbolic of their jobs . They believe the index finger pointing to the open palm is saying , rather directly , " Pay here . " <p> " ' Show me the money ! ' That was my first impression when I saw it , " laughs computer analyst Ronald Batleman . <p> Others say the striped towers look like barber poles or the arms of a uniformed convict . " We thought it would be a good place to kick a field goal , " says Randy Chartier , another systems analyst . <p> A tactful Eversley does n't offer any judgment on the sculpture , except to say , " It is not pablum . It gets people talking . " <p> And that is the point , says Liz Gibson , GSA 's deputy fine arts officer for the national capital region . " The conflict in public art grew out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art for art 's sake , if you will , " Gibson explains . " Now public art is more about creating environments that are thought-provoking instead of aggressive . " <p> An architect , she calls Eversley 's work " very elegant . " It 's a New Age alchemy , blending hard science with alluring fantasy . Some of Eversley 's more popular creations are fountains that cascade ultra-refined , crystal-clear oil . They 're not just pleasant to behold in a Zen way ; they 're also experiments in fluid dynamics , viscosity and light refraction . <p> " There 's this image of the square engineer , the non-creative person , " he says . " Do I think art is a more creative profession than engineering ? I do not . Creativity transcends boundaries . " <p> His father , Frederick Sr. , was an aircraft engineer from Brooklyn who worked on warbirds like the P-47 and F-84 . Frederick Jr . followed that flight path initially , graduating from Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Tech in 1963 . <p> He moved to Southern California , worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Space Administration , made some money in the stock market , and decided to " retire " from engineering in 1967 . He was 25 , it was the Summer of Love , why not become an artist ? He moved into a laundromat converted to a studio by the architect Frank Gehry . <p> His highly polished , soft-hued shapes , which he created in a centrifuge , earned him an important one-man show at the Whitney Museum in 1970 . " Eversley has made it , " The Washington Post said in 1977 . That year he started his artist-in-residence position at the Air and Space Museum , given a workshop in the basement to further experiment with plastics and resins . A ventilation system fiasco ensued  --  the resin fumes were seeping into the building . So he changed his media to include precast acrylics , glass and metal . <p> " In a way this is an extension of that work , " he says , screwing together the prefabricated pieces of the sculpture in New Carrollton . Smokers and brown-baggers troop over to ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Will the pool be drained in winter ? ( No . ) What 's it called ? ( You decide . ) One man offers the ultimate compliment : " It looks very well engineered . " <p> The artist smiles . " The worst thing that can happen is that people walk by it and hardly notice , or say , ' Who cares ? ' " <p> The best thing is what 's happening right now .
