<p> ALAMOSA - Recent events at Sacred Heart Catholic Church may not qualify as a full-color , prayer-induced miracle complete with saints , but it certainly qualifies as a triumph in the face of seeming defeat : a rescue and redemption of an artistic vision . <p> The 1926 church is on the National Register of Historic Places , though a quick glance at the unexceptional exterior might make one wonder why . <p> Quite a contrast <p> Inside is another matter . Worshippers are immediately confronted with a massive Christus - Jesus of the Sacred Heart - towering the full height of the apse against a background of gold stippling . Framing the standing figure are roundels with saints and angels , scenes from both books of the Bible , and decorative flourishes . <p> It is a fresco painted by Josef Steinhage ( pronounced ' stine-hog-eh ' ) , a German-American and second generation master of the Beuronese style of painting . Beuronese - named for the Abbey Beuron in southern Germany where the style began - is an artistic movement that combined both the Byzantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylized pattern and decoration . The style was popular in Europe at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries . Begun in the 1940s , the Christus and its accompanying decor took four years to complete . <p> This was , however , only the starting point for Steinhage 's vision for Sacred Heart Church . After all , the artist <p> had taken 12 years to cover the interior walls and ceiling of <p> the St. Scholastica Chapel near Chicago , considered his magnum opus of all the murals and frescoes painted both in Germany and the United States . <p> Alamosa might seem an unlikely place for an acknowledged master of sacred art to land . But it was a formal commission , and it was in Alamosa that Steinhage met his wife , Mary . Paul , their son , grew up there , later marrying a San Luis Valley woman himself . Steinhage remained in the valley the rest of his life , doing military service and taking American citizenship . <p> The full-figure Christus was not the whole of Steinhage 's vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Latin was the language of mass and liturgy , and Catholic churches had subsidiary altars dedicated to saints Mary and Joseph , Jesus ' mortal parents . Steinhage created a luminous mural over the Mary altar : Mary of the nativity , flanked by angels with the infant Jesus at her feet . Side panels showed the adoration of the shepherds and magi . <p> Started St. Joseph <p> In 1951 he began a second mural , a portrayal of St. Joseph as the master craftsman - a carpenter by biblical account - and patron of those who build . Preliminary sketches of the proposed mural depicted various bishops and saints of the church who were associated with major religious buildings . They would , in traditional manner , be shown holding models of their respective creations . In a bow to Southwestern imagery that parisioners wanted , Steinhage also proposed kneeling figures of an Indian chief in full feather bonnet and a man wearing a Mexican peasant costume with a sombrero hanging down his back . <p> The full figure of St. Joseph had been sketched in and largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirrored Steinhage 's treatment of St. Mary . The Indian was largely complete and the Mexican figure well sketched . Only trial pencil marks against Steinhage 's carefully plotted grid indicated where other figures might appear . <p> At that point , Steinhage covered the mural with a canvas curtain and stopped work . The curtain stayed in place for 40 years until the year prior to the artist 's death at age 96 in 1998 . For 40 years the notoriously close-mouthed and intensely private old Rhineland native offered no explanations , nor would he allow the unfinished mural to be uncovered . <p> The only proffered reason - given toward the end of Steinhage 's life and , perhaps , as apology to Father Gary Kennedy , parish priest at Sacred Heart - was ' I just could n't get his ( Joseph 's ) face the way I wanted . ' <p> Steinhage ultimately stopped painting altogether . <p> Later he lost sight in one eye from glaucoma and this , most probably , was the unvoiced reason for his abrupt halt . Indeed , the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist 's usual confident limning . They are less bold in conception , less strong than figures in the St. Mary mural . The curtain was a proud man 's response to diminished ability . <p> Another possibility <p> But another reason might have been artistic rebellion brought about between Steinhage 's carefully learned iconography and its use of color symbolism vs. the insisted-upon inclusion of Southwest images with which he was unfamiliar and may have felt to be in direct conflict with his vision . <p> The parish received no explanations from the artist . <p> It was Kennedy who decided to act . ' I was preparing my sermon and saw him and said I thought it was time to take it ( the curtain ) off . I figured an unfinished work was better than none . ' <p> After the awesome majesty of the Christus and the serene mural of St. Mary , the hidden mural was a letdown . <p> ' It looked chintzy , ' admitted Kennedy . <p> Nonetheless , the church feted the old man with a mass in his honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he felt guilty about it , ' reflected Kennedy , ' but taking the curtain away freed him , and the mass kind of gave him permission to admit it would never be finished , at least by him . ' <p> But a small miracle was in the working . <p> Early this year Kennedy presented the parish council with a choice . A major renovation of the church budgeted at $ 250,000 was in the works . But there was only enough money for an organ or restoring and completing the mural . <p> Discovery has effect <p> Finishing the mural became a real choice because Anne , Steinhage 's daughter-in-law , came across a trove of sketches and watercolors that obviously were ideas for the St. Joseph mural . There were 166 of them , in various degrees of finish . One ' sketch ' was a detailed watercolor study of the central panel of the mural . With that and other more-or-less completed studies , the parish council opted to try to complete the mural . <p> Who , though , would do the actual completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Ramirez of Axis Mundi , a Chicago-based firm that specializes in church renovation and design . Ramirez was ideal since he already knew Steinhage 's style and method . He had previously spent over four years restoring the frescoes Steinhage had painted for St. Scholastica in Chicago . Ramirez , 40 , was born in San Francisco of Irish and Hispanic parentage . He is a 6-footer whose narrow face with its beard and shock of dark hair resembles the somewhat fuller face of St. Joseph in the Sacred Heart Church mural . <p> After graduation from high school , he went to Europe , looking at galleries and studying furniture design in England . He returned to the U.S. to study art restoration at the Art Institute of Chicago School . Among his first projects was a full-scale reproduction of the famous Santa Croce crucifix of Cimabue , one of the milestones in the history of art . <p> ' I thought I 'd do construction by day and art by night , ' he said , ' but Sheetrock did me in . ' He turned to art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iconographic painting in her native Turkey and had joined him in previous projects . <p> With him in Alamosa was another partner , Sean Culver , 37 , who grew up in the Midwest . He was drawn to photography and painting , which were his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago when Ramirez was there . The two clicked and a 14-year association was born . <p> As part of working on the St. Scholastica restoration , Ramirez had journeyed to Alamosa in 1992 to meet Steinhage . It was frustrating , a trial , he recalled . Steinhage had become somewhat deaf and conversation was uncomfortable . ' I wanted to do a taped interview for the St. Scholastica archives , but he was extremely uncomfortable at this . ' Ironically , though Ramirez saw Sacred Heart Church , not even he got past the canvas curtain that would be his next Steinhage project . <p> Work began Aug. 16 , 1999 . <p> The trick in restoration , said Ramirez , is ' to understand the technique , but not be dominated by it . ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner portion of the St. Joseph mural , a small portrayal of anxious parents finding Jesus in the temple , had water damage . ' It had begun to peel and there was mold . We cut it out ( from the wall , on its linen backing ) for standard conservation work . ' It and a companion ' Flight Into Egypt ' were easier worked on by detaching the work and bringing it down to ground level . But the rest of the job was up on scaffolding , dealing with a 9-by-13-foot unfinished painting . <p> Both conservators speculated on the differences between what Steinhage had begun and what he envisioned , expressed in an amazingly detailed watercolor reduction . Of the latter , Ramirez enthused , ' The detail is just beautiful - look at how each hair ( on Joseph 's head ) is painted with highlighting and all . The feathers of the angels ' wings are precisely outlined . ... I think he was one of those old-time technical masters who found absolute joy in demonstrating his ability . ' <p> Other watercolors detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussy changes , Steinhage having played with artistic elements . <p> Even so , patches of the mural remained incomplete , unnoted in any artist 's sketch . Other elements were troubling . The face of the kneeling Indian ' was n't working ' by Ramirez 's estimation of Steinhage 's art . The two restorers sought models from the community to complete the mural , since they could find no compelling reason to go with Steinhage 's initial concept of church bishops associated with major building projects . <p> ' I thought it would be a nice contrast with the St. Mary mural , where the Virgin is surrounded by men , to have some female figures around St. Joseph , ' Ramirez said . <p> For the kneeling Indian , the painter found octogenarian and Native American Gilbert Cisneros . The figure holds a view of Mount Blanca , which anchors the north end of the San Luis Valley . Behind him is an Anglo woman , Mary Lavey , holding a hand-crafted pot ( she is a potter ) , and next to her is Native American Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kneeling figure in Mexican dress is Antonio Garcia , the building contractor who constructed a shrine for the Stations of the Cross in nearby San Luis . He holds a model of that chapel . Behind him stand Natalia Olivas , draped in a shawl , and Sally Lopez in a delicately flowered blouse . <p> All this ' happened so fast it was a surprise , because it was decided and largely done in four days . The mural dictated the figures . ' <p> Other changes at the church include moving the main altar forward , though it is still defined by the Christus . The subsidiary altars for Sts . Mary and Joseph have been taken out . To give the murals a sense of weight , the blank area below has been painted and ragged ( a texturing method ) in a solid color similar to the background of the two murals . <p> Six-week span <p> From start to finish , the mural project took about three , six-day weeks with 12-hour days . <p> To give the whole interior a sense of unity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with complementary colors . This might even include some stenciling , to pick up elements of Steinhage 's decorative designs . Culver , despite long hours on the scaffold , recounted ' how open , how warm everyone has been . If we 'd wanted , we could have had home cooked dinners every day . ' Someone had left coffee cake that morning at the rectory where they were staying . Everyone has just been so supportive and so interested to see how it all was coming along . ' <p> Paradoxically , once completed , the mural was again covered by a curtain . Kennedy joked that the curtain would remain until the project was paid for . But the official unveiling will be Nov. 1 during a 6 p.m. ceremony . <p> Contributions to help defray the costs of the mural restoration may be sent to : Sacred Heart Church , P.O. Box 547 , Alamosa , CO 81101 . The frescoes and murals of Sacred Heart are open to the public .
