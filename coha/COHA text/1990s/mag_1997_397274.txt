<p> Foods derived from animals contribute significantly to total nutrients in the U.S. food supply . Moreover , the availability to humans of the nutrients in animal products is high , often exceeding the availability for the same nutrients , e.g. , calcium and phosphorus , in foods derived from plants . Animal-derived foods are a primary source of cobalamin ( vitamin B12 ) and pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) , riboflavin , niacin , zinc , phosphorus , and calcium for the U.S. population . Nearly 70% of dietary protein and nearly 40% of dietary calories are of animal origin . Between 30% and 40% of dietary thiamin , vitamin A , iron , and magnesium is of animal origin . All dietary cholesterol and about three-fourths of saturated fatty acids in the average U.S. diet come from animal-derived foods . <p> Compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , U.S. Department of Agriculture , and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 1995 , is one of the most agreed upon recommendations for the U.S. population of all ages to maintain optimal health . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially fats rich in saturated fatty acids ) and cholesterol , Americans have omitted or restricted intake of specific animal-derived foods and have shifted sources of foods from animals . In concurrence with the Guidelines , Americans consume animal-derived foods for their important nutritional contributions to healthful diets . Moreover , there is a rationale for including animal-derived foods in balanced diets . An ongoing challenge of consumers is to understand how to apply the time-honored principles of balance , variety , and moderation by making wise choices from all food groups . <p> Trends In The American Diet . The American diet has been and continues to be in a dynamic flux . Changes in dietary ingredients have occurred because of availability , price , disposable income , advertising , and human health concerns . From the early- to mid-1900s , per capita consumption of red meat , poultry , and fish decreased only to increase again to attain a current intake of around 225 pounds annually . Current annual per capita consumption of red meats is as follows : beef , 64 pounds ; pork , 49 pounds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken consumption is about 49 pounds per capita , and annual turkey consumption is about 14 pounds . Per capita consumption of fish and shellfish is about 15 pounds/year . Per capita egg consumption peaked at 393 eggs/year in 1951 and currently is about 233/year . Per capita consumption of dairy products increased until about the mid-1900s , decreased slightly until 1975 , and has increased slightly until now . Consumption of lowfat milk has increased in recent years at the expense of whole milk . When expressed on a milk-equivalent basis , dairy-product consumption is nearly 586 pounds/person annually . Consumption of animal fats , primarily as lard and butter , has decreased to about 10 pounds/year , whereas consumption of vegetable fat has risen to approximately 54 pounds/year . In general , trends in consumption of animal products during the past 30 years involve more use of poultry meats , fish , lowfat milk , yogurt , and cheese and less use of red meat , whole milk , eggs , butter , and lard . <p> Nutrient Composition of Animal Products . From the standpoint of quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it supplies all the essential amino acids in desirable proportions . Although organ tissues are especially rich in most essential minerals and vitamins , muscle is a rich source of phosphorus , iron , copper , and zinc . Muscle is the major dietary source of cobalamin ( vitamin B and pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) and supplies appreciable amounts of biotin , niacin , pantothenic acid , riboflavin , and thiamin . <p> Nutrient composition of muscle is fairly similar among the mammals , birds , and fish consumed . A major difference in carcass composition among species , within species , and within individual animals is the ratio of fat to muscle in the edible portion . This ratio is important nutritionally if a high-fat diet is undesirable . As fat percentage increases , nutrient concentration of the portion of flesh decreases . And fatty acid composition of fat depends on species . Whereas the fat of all land animals is fairly saturated , beef contains less of the essential fatty acid linoleic than pork or poultry does . Milk fat also is highly saturated but contains more desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish contain relatively saturated fats whereas ocean-caught fish contain highly unsaturated fatty acids with significant amounts of omega-3 ( n-3 ) polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) . All animal flesh contains cholesterol ; usually the quantity is related closely to amount of fat in the flesh . Egg yolk and shrimp contain exceptionally high concentrations . <p> Cooking or heat processing generally has a minimal effect on the nutritional value of animal-derived foods , and cooking usually decreases moisture and concentrates other nutrients . Fat often is higher in the cooked than in the raw product because of moisture loss ; for intensely heated products such as bacon or regular hamburger , however , fat content is decreased significantly , with negligible loss of other nutrients . Thorough cooking of meats should be encouraged because it will decrease the risk of microbial contamination . <p> Heightened Nutrition Concern . Consumer concerns about nutrition have increased in recent years . Nutrient considerations now rank second only to taste considerations when consumers shop ; price , product safety , and convenience are lesser concerns . Interest in the diet has been stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fat , cholesterol , and sodium and underconsumption of other nutrients such as calcium increase the risk of several chronic diseases . <p> The most prominent dietary recommendation made to Americans in the past 10 to 20 years is that of eating a diet lower in fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol. ( * ) Because some animal-derived foods are rich in fat and saturated fatty acids and because only animal-derived foods contain cholesterol , some consumers have attempted to follow guidelines for lowfat diets by omitting or restricting animal products . Additionally , over the past two decades , Americans have shifted sources of animal-derived foods as they attempt to comply with dietary recommendations . Among the most notable changes are a decline in the use of red meats and eggs ; an increase in the use of poultry , fish , and cheese ; and the use of lowfat milks and vegetable oils in place of whole milk and animal fats , respectively . <p> As discussed in this article , animal-derived foods make important nutritional contributions to healthful diets , and there is a rationale for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Information about nutrient contributions of animal and other foods to U.S. diets are of two types : disappearance data and actual nutrient intake data . <p> Each year , the USDA Human Nutrition Information Service estimates the amounts of nutrients available per person per day in the U.S. food supply . These so-called disappearance data are calculated from government estimates of foods available for consumption in the United States and , specifically , of the sum of food production , beginning inventories , and imports minus the sum of exports , industrial uses , farm seed and feed use , and year-end inventories . Because the figures do not account for spoilage and waste , they overestimate absolute intake of foods and nutrients . Nevertheless , they provide both valuable information about trends in food and nutrient consumption over time and useful comparisons of nutrients supplied by different food commodities . <p> The table shown lists percentage contributions to several nutrients , by USDA food grouping , in 1988 . Contributions of animal-derived foods , i.e. , meat , poultry , fish , eggs , and dairy products , are highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , as a group , muscle foods are nutrient dense . And the contributions of meats to trace mineral intake such as iron and zinc are particularly important because intakes of these minerals are less than optimal among certain population subgroups . The contribution of milk and its products to calcium intake is worth special note , for this one food group provides three-fourths of all calcium in the food supply . Dairy foods also provide important amounts of nutrients such as potassium and vitamin D , which are not calculated by the USDA . Eggs are an especially rich source of cholesterol and provide a full third of the cholesterol in the food supply . <p> In short , disappearance data indicate that animal-derived foods are major contributors to dietary fat consumed in the United States ( and of course to cholesterol consumed , because plant foods are devoid of it ) but also provide major proportions of essential nutrients . Note that the fats and oils group , consisting primarily of vegetable oils , supplies nearly half the fat in the food supply but no other nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the USDA conducted the seventh National Food Consumption Survey ( NFCS ) and compared results with those of the previous NFCS conducted in 1977-1978 . Mean intakes of meat , poultry , and fish and of milk and milk products , among the main foods groups , declined . Respondents consumed less beef and pork and drank less whole milk than respondents had 10 years before . The 1988 respondents consumed more mixtures from meat , poultry , and fish and drank more lowfat and skim milk . <p> In the 1977-1978 NFCS , which was completed by more than 36,000 individuals , the three-day mean intake of all meats and all mixtures that were mainly meat was 204 g . Preliminary data on one-day intakes from the 1987-1988 NFCS indicate that average total meat intake was 193 g , based on a sample size of 237,791 . The primary shift in meat consumption was from individual meats  --  i.e. , beef , pork , lamb , veal , game , poultry , fish , shellfish , and processed meats  --  to meat mixtures , which averaged 74 g over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in 1987-1988 . <p> For population groups at risk , the decline in meat consumption along with the shift to mixed dishes could be a concern . In 1977-1978 , women 19 through 50 years old consumed an average of 188 g of meat , poultry , and fish daily , according to the USDA , which supplied about 31% of average daily energy intake , 45% of average daily fat intake , and 37% of average daily iron intake . Total dietary iron intake averaged 10.8 mg ( 72% of the current recommended daily allowance RDA of 15 mg for women ) , more than one-third of which was derived from the highly bioavailable iron in meats . <p> But by 1986 , women in this age group had decreased meat , poultry , and fish intake to a mean of 152 g , according to the USDA , with muscle foods supplying 22% of total energy , 31% of dietary fat , only 26% ( or 2.6 mg ) of iron , and 45% of zinc ( zinc data not available for the earlier survey ) . Total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the RDA , for women ; total zinc intake averaged 8.7 mg per day , or 72% of the RDA . <p> Food mixtures with meat as the primary ingredient accounted for 36% of meat consumed by men , women , and children in 1977-1978 , according to the USDA , and for 44% in 1987-1988 . Preliminary analysis of the 1987-1988 NFCS indicates that women who consumed no meat or only meat in mixtures had a three-day average of only 50% of their RDAs for iron and zinc . Women who consumed one to six ounces of single meat items met or exceeded the RDA for zinc , but average iron intake of premenopausal women never exceeded 80% of the RDA . Women who consume less than six ounces of lowfat meat daily , the approximate amount now recommended nationally , may fail to consume adequate amounts of trace nutrients , particularly iron and zinc . <p> Healthful Diets . Nutritionists for many years have recommended balance , variety , and moderation as cornerstones of a healthful diet . A recent study supports the importance of variety and balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary diversity , i.e. , consumption of the five major food groups  --  dairy products , meats , grains , fruits , and vegetables , to all-cause mortality . The researchers used dietary information collected during the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys , or NHANES I , ( 1971-1975 ) and mortality data from the same subjects ( determined during the First NHANES Epidemiology Follow-Up Study , 1982-1987 ) . People eating from two or fewer food groups per day had an increased risk of mortality . <p> Although the researchers did not attempt to relate mortality to intake of specific foods , they did note that , among the respondents consuming from two or fewer food groups , more than 90% consumed no fruit and more than 80% ate no vegetables or dairy foods . The importance of dietary diversity is underscored by this study . <p> Recent research indicates that foods derived from ruminant animals contain conjugated linoleic acid , a fatty acid in lipids that has protective effects on development of cancer , atherosclerosis , and obesity . Lesser amounts are found in foods from nonruminants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Current evidence indicates that consumption of traditional animal-derived foods may be sufficient to provide some protective health effects of the conjugated linoleic acid contained therein . Moreover , current research is being directed to determine health benefits of other constituents of animal-derived foods not mentioned before such as sphingomyelin , butyrate , and ether lipids . <p> In recent years , however , concern about excess dietary fat  --  and to a lesser extent dietary cholesterol  --  has overshadowed the balance , variety , and moderation approach even though one of the principles , i.e. , moderation , directly addresses dietary excess . <p> ( * ) For additional discussion on these matters , see " Diet and Heart Disease : Not What Your Think , " CR , July 1996 and " Why Butter is Good For You , " CR , March 1996 . <p> This article is excerpted from " Contribution of Animal Products to Healthful Diets , " a task force report by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology ( CAST ) in Ames , Iowa .
