Carol wanted the boy alive only to spite her own husband . <p> The woman on the television was grotesquely overweight , her hair a thatch of gray and what looked on the screen to be some flat , amberlike coloring . A huge T-shirt printed with a bundle of multicolored balloons lay like a tent over her chest . Her face was a messshe was crying , had been for some time . That was clear . " You can get help here , Rory , " she told the camera , sobbing . " Please come home . We love you . You do n't have your insulin . You do n't have none of your medicine . " She poked at her eyes with a big red handkerchief . " Please , " she said again , shaking her head , " we want to help you , and we 're the only ones who can . " The girl Rory had shot five times was still alive . The news report said she was 19 . He was 26 . They interviewed a preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said no one in Stockbridge would ever have thought that something like this could happen in a small town . " In a city , sure-but things like this are not supposed to happen here . " But they do , Carol thought . The six o'clock news verified that the unthinkable had occurred last night about two in the morning in Stockbridge , a small town just 30 minutes down the river from where she and Lloyd were watching the news while finishing their vegetable soup . The search for Rory Melius had already begun . That morning , his Dodge Ram had been found on a gravel road that dead-ended on a bluff overlooking the Big Sioux . " Poor guy 'll be dead , " Lloyd told her . " You watch . He probably used that gun on himself . " Carol looked up at him angrily , but he was busy watching . On TV the reporter spoke to the anchor . " Walt , the police are n't saying much about Rory Melius . From all reports here-and Stockbridge is a little town-few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears he did . The police have issued no warnings , really . They 're not saying that he 's armed and dangerous . " " That 's because they think he 's already gone , " Lloyd told Carol . " He 's not dangerous . His gun is empty . He put five into her and had one left . " " How can you say that ? " she said . " Well , count " em yourself , " he said . " That 's not what I mean , " Carol told him . " This is n't a movie , Lloyd-these are real people . " He turned toward her . " It 's domestic , honey . It does n't matter that they were n't married . It 's passion gone , shot to hecklove to hate to despair . " He shook his head . " He 's gone , Carol-you know that . Why do you think they 're not putting out an APB ? " " I just wish you were n't so sure of yourself , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - is that it ? " " Comfort ? " he said . " Yes , comfort , " she told him , picking up his dish , the milk , their silvenware , then getting up to take it to the kitchen . " Does it build you up or something to think you know exactly how all of this is going to turn out ? " She could feel his eyes on her . " Are you angry ? " he said . " I 'm not angry , " she told him , her back to him . " I 'm just not as sure as you are that you 're clairvoyant , and I wish you would n't do that-tell me what the outcome of this horrible , sinful mess is , as if you knew , as if it were written in stone . " " It 's a plain old lovers " triangle , " he said . " It is n't just a " lovers " triangle , " Lloydmy goodness . " She opened the dishwasher . It was still full from last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen-somebody 's aching . There 's a young girl shot . Ca n't you see that ? " " Is what I said wrong ? " he asked her , picking up the crackers and jelly . " To me , it just looked open and shut , honey . There 's too many things here- " " I do n't want to hear any more , okay ? " she said . " Let 's just drop the whole thing . " When she heard him open the newspaper , she was still turned away from him . One silent hour later , she lied to him , told him she was going to Wal-Mart when she was going to River Hills , a park five miles west of town where the meandering Big Sioux River cut jagged sides from the yellow clay of a series of sharp bluffs . There were no police at the entrance-not that she expected them really , but the park was n't more than a half-hour away from the spot where they 'd found the boy 's truck . It was May , late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she first stopped the car and stood outside for just a moment , the whited path of the river showed how high it had been carrying snow melt and heavy spring rains . All the way along , maples and cottonwoods had been brought low by the high water , dumped neatly as if kneeling for a drink . From the very beginning of their awful heartache , she and Lloyd had been together on everything , worked together ever since the day their son-in-law , Burt , had called to tell them Paige had walked away , left him and their precious little Hannah for some teacher in that school she taught at in Joliet . She and Lloyd had never disagreed , not really . Not once . They 'd sat together before the fireplace they 'd just had built that fall-the idea was a sweet place to spend cold winter evenings , just the two of them . They 'd talk and talk and talk about what could or could n't be done ; and not once in all those nights had they really disagreed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no horrific grievance against her husband . Burt had treated both of them well , their daughter and granddaughter . She and Lloyd had agreed that it was their own Paige who was at fault here , and they 'd told Burt as much , time and time again when they 'd call him or when they 'd talk to his folks . Maybe Lloyd had been more angry than she . It was Lloyd who had done most of the talking-and the yelling . It was Lloyd who 'd laid down the law . It was Lloyd who 'd cut Paige off-told her that he and her mom had to play hardball with the outright sin she 'd done , that neither they nor the Lord God Almighty would buy her excuse about never really loving Burtand the baby , my goodness , the baby . From the very beginning , three months ago-from Burt 's first call-not once had she and Lloyd really disagreed about how to handle what their daughter had done . She got back in the car and slowly followed the winding road down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the mat of gray mud that caked the banks after the spring floods . She pulled up to the bank of the river on freshly laid gravel , looked around to see if anyone else was there-the boy named Rory had tried to murder the girl , after all . " Plain old lovers " triangle , " Lloyd had said . And why was she calling him a boy ? At 26 , he was a man . I do n't want to find him , she told herself-that 's not the point . I do n't want to see a boy who tried to murder a girl . I just do n't want Lloyd to be right . Lord , she said , do n't let him be right . She did n't really know the problem . For years she 'd lived with his noisy eating-soup , for instance . It seemed that he had to make noise when he sipped . But lately it was so irritating she could n't take it . And why ? Because of Paige ? His laughing at a TV show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students " papers . Just knowing he was working at something in his office . Having to hear his strong bass voice in church made her almost nauseated-was it a virus she 'd picked up from her daughter ? They 'd had a wonderful marriage-28 good years . But lately she was capable of taking so very little of him . She left the Buick behind and followed the uneven path of freshly laid gravel as it skirted the banks of the river . Across the water , beaver dens gaped like black moons from the banks beneath four scraggly cottonwoods splayed in four different directions like pencils in a cup . Midstream , a sculpture of bleached limbs , one of the river 's earlier victims , stood like a monument to the torrent of water that now seemed wide and slow and safe , nowhere near to dangerous . What she wanted , of course , was for the boy to give himself up , not do himself in . But did the boy mean anything to her really ? She wanted him alive only to spite her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't the right word , either . What she hated was the fact that this horror of Paige 's flooded every last part of her , and had , for three months , swept everything alive and growing into its channel , everything at work and at home and at church-wherever . She could n't sleep , and hearing his breathing relax into that heavy pattern she 'd heard for years only aggravated her more . She had to force herself to eat , but he did n't seem to be suffering at all . Twice in three months they 'd made love , and both times she tried to fake her enjoyment . Maybe she should simply go to Joliet herself , alone , she thought . Maybe if she would take Paige into her arms-maybe , maybe , maybe . The park was empty , the river quiet , bedded down calmly . And then she felt it . It came into her like something cool and refreshing , even though she recognized it for what it was the second it entered her : despair . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should he go on living ? What single good reason could he give to come home to insulin and prison ? There was a bullet left in that gun . Why not just quit ? She stopped and looked down at the water , silent and constant like eternity , and her own sadness , like the boy 's , fed the flow of despair that came up suddenly and refreshingly from her soul . It would end things , she thought . It would end suffering . It would end horror . It would end aggravation that she lacked the strength and courage to fight anymore . It would end nausea . It would allow her rest . Despair as relief . Across the water , a huge , scruffy owl swooped out of a tree but stayed in the woods , flying between thick branches like a circus performer . It was wrong , she knew-despair was the lack of hope , and hope was hers , always , eternally . Why was she feeling it ? How was it that despair even felt so good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter , she and Lloyd , when the snowbanks lay along the unsheltered paths like bread dough , and the deer left broken chains of darkened prints down the bluffs . They 'd come here several times in the last year-before Paige had left Burt-because now , with the house empty , they 'd been trying to come up with some new ways of being together : cross-country skiing , photography . They 'd been right there where she was standing , the two of them leaning on their ski poles , sweaty , trying to catch their breath , when a half-dozen deer walked right across the river in a single line . Life was good , a miracle . That was before their daughter had done something unthinkable . That was before Paige shattered God 's law-an adulterer . Paige , adulterer . Lord , give me strength , she prayed , her eyes on the dark river beside her . Through the trees on the bluff , the sound of the car coming down the road startled her , sent something she recognized as fear through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own car , parked by itself at the river 's edge , and felt a kind of embarrassment when a brown squad car from the county sheriff 's office emerged from the trees at the bottom of the hill . A quarter-mile away , she watched as the squad car pulled up and an officer stepped out , a woman , who walked around the Buick as if it were a suspect , then followed what were likely Carol 's own footprints in the gravel , and looked down the path toward the woods , where she stood . The young woman , her blond hair pulled back tightly , removed her sunglasses and held a hand up over her eyes , then stared into the trees . In a gesture that seemed instinctive , she checked for the gun on her belt before tossing her hat in the car and locking it . Then she started walking , looking for the driver . Poor thing thinks maybe there 's another suicide , Carol thought . So she stepped out of the trees , stood there motionless for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily , as if there were nothing amiss . The policewoman stopped , thought for a moment about going back , then kept coming closer . Maybe the wave was n't enough , she thought . Maybe the woman read the wave as someone putting her off . Carol looked down at her watch and realized that she 'd been gone far too long , so she put her hands in the pockets of her coat and started walking back . " I 'm okay , " she said , quite loud , once the officer approached . The woman smiled . " I came down to have a look at the river , " Carol told her . " It 's something I do a lot . " " You too ? " the woman said . Carol shrugged her shoulders . " You mean you were n't worried ? " " I 'm always worried . It comes with the territory . " She stopped , ten feet away , just far enough that Carol could n't quite read the name on the plate on her chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike , " she said . " It 's my region anyway-it 's not like I 'm slacking . " " There 's something about water , " Carol said . The woman nodded . " You 're not scared ? " " Scared ? " " I figure you do n't know , " she told her . " Stockbridge-you 're not scared of the kid who shot his girlfriend ? " " Do n't know what ? " Carol said . " He turned himself in , " the woman told her , smiling . " We pretty much knew he would . Might have been his mother on the TV , though , " she told her . " I thought you might have heard the story- " " I heard , " Carol said . She looked away at the river . The woman followed her gaze . " Sometimes when I 'm down here alone , there 's beaver running around on the banks across the river , making a big mess . " She pointed to the other side . " You think all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wrong . Beavers massacre " em over there-here too . " She pointed at trees not more than 20 feet away , already half-gnawed . " People think they 're smart , but they aren't-that 's what I 'm told . They just do it for the heck of it-maybe to keep their teeth sharp , who knows ? " " Nature 's engineers , " Carol said . " I always thought of them as nature 's engineers , dam builders . " " Ask the guy up the hill . " The woman nodded toward the park ranger 's office . " He wishes he could get rid of the whole lot of them . All they do is make a mess . But there is n't much call for beaver hats anymore . " And then , for the first time , she looked directly at Carol in a way that dropped any bit of profession and pretense . She smiled . " I 'm glad you 're all right . I 've had a big day . " " At least the boy is alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy-he 's as old as I am . " The woman shook her head , looked around aimlessly . " I was with his mother last night for a while , " she said with a begrudging smile . " Women officers , you know-we 're supposed to be better at that sort of thing . " She shook her head . " That woman-her heart is gone . It 's like it 's not even there . That kid shot his girl , but he killed his mother . " " I saw her , " Carol said . " She was worse off-camera , " the cop said . " No kidding . " Carol felt as if the woman had already said enough . " So this is your beat ? " The woman smiled . " There 's a place down the river-the other way , " she said . She was Paige 's age , a little older , maybe . " If you 'd walked the opposite direction , you would have seen it . " She half turned . " You want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged her shoulders , " - when I just like , have to , you know ? " Once again , she looked at Carol in a way that seemed childlike in its pleading . " I suppose it 's unprofessional , but this job-it is n't what I thought it was going to be . It 's not glamorous and it 's not at all easy on a woman . " " I 'm sorry , " Carol said . " I do n't want pity , " the cop said . " And it 's not that I do n't like what I do . There 's just some times I have to stop down here and go see this upturned tree-in the river . " She pulled her hands out of her pockets and drew a circle in the air . " It 's huge . Some beaver probably dumped it a dozen years ago , and the branches are all bleached like old bones-like that . " She pointed at a flattened cottonwood just 50 yards away in the river . " It 's like that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands rounded out huge branches . " But this spring-you know , when the water was high ? - the river grabbed this whole other tree and laid it in those branches so that the whole thing looks almost like a big- " she bit her lip , searching for words , " - well , like a big cross , I guess . " She seemed embarrassed . " I used to believe in God , " she said . " Sometimes I look at that tree , you know-at the way it makes a huge cross in the middle of the river , right in the middle of all that mud , and it just gets me-I mean , something weird like that . It 's huge . " Her face fell . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " It 's been a tough one the last couple days-that mother and the girl . " " It 's okay , " Carol said . " Show me . I 'd love to see . " " Maybe it wo n't mean anything to you-I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's huge , and it sits right out there like something God stuck in the middle of everything , you know ? It 's just not something you 'd expect to find-you know what I mean ? It 's like a shock or something . " She stuck her hands in her pockets , kicked at the gravel . " It 's just something I like to look at , I guess . It 's dumb , I know . A couple of dead trees . I 'm sorry- " " What do you mean you used to be a believer ' ? " Carol said , laughing . " You sound like you still are . " " If I am , it 's because of that tree . " And she laughed , hard , in big heaves of breath that could have , in a moment , evolved into tears . " That 's stupid , is n't it ? " she said . " And I 'm sorry-here I am an officer of the law and all of that , and I 'm spilling my guts over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We all should be better than we are , " Carol told her , and she walked up to her , then waited for the offer of a shoulder . When it came , she put her arm around her . " Show me , " she said . " I do n't believe it . I want to see this huge tree . I need it too . " " Somebody your age got problems ? " the woman said . " You know better than to ask that , " Carol said . " You 're a cop . " " You know , " the woman said , " you got your life , and you got your job , but I guess that 's not really everything . " She pulled away . " Let me show you . That 's why I came . " When she got home , Lloyd was standing outside the back door , waiting , his jacket on . " You must have done some serious shopping , " he said . " I did n't go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk , he grabbed her in his arms . " Carol , that kid-the guy who shot his girl-he came home . He 's not dead . It was on TV . He came back . " " I know , " she said . " I heard . " She put an arm around him , tucked her hand in the pocket of his jacket . " I went down to the river- " " You did ? " " I went down to the river , and you ca n't believe what I saw , " she told him . " It 's incredible . " " We have n't been there for a long time , " he said . She pinched his side . " I 'll take you , tomorrow . " Author Affiliation James Calvin Schaap is professor of English at Dordt College .
