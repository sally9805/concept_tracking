TREMORS Directed by Ron Underwood <P> Screenplay by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock <P> White sales , the first days of a New Year's-resolution diet , an entry in a magazine subscription sweepstakes : January is a month of small hopes . And of petty disappointments : you know that the queen-size percales are going to be sold out , that you are going to succumb to a chocolate fit and that Ed McMahon is not going to appear on the doorstep and hand you a million-dollar check . <P> In seasons past , Hollywood has not been as helpful as it might have been in lifting dulled spirits . Having hyped themselves into exhaustion with their holiday releases and feeling their annual Oscar anxiety beginning to build , the studios get the January blahs just like the rest of us . Here , have another helping of turkey hash . <P> This year , though , a youthful team of sci-fientists has brought out an antidepressant that actually works , because it stirs only cautious hopes for a couple of laughs and a few innocent thrills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Tremors , and the curious thing about it is that it is based on an ancient formula , practically a folk remedy : a small isolated community is disturbed first by mysterious rumblings , then by alarming disappearances and deaths , after which large , smart , implacable creatures manifest themselves and desperate defenses are improvised by a cast that is not obviously wiser or braver than the average audience . <P> The featured creatures this time are gigantic earthworms , 30 ft. long , capable of comic-alarming subterranean rapid transit ( you just see this furrow moving across the desert at Road Runner speed ) . When they surface , they reveal trifurcated tongues , each extension ending in a funny-nasty suction cup . In other words , they are great special effects , informed by the mutant-monster tradition of ' 50s horror movies but satirizing that tradition in a delicate way  --  neither condescending nor indulgent . <P> The town they are terrorizing holds a meeting to name their antagonists , decides " graboids " will do nicely and starts dithering over defensive strategies . Perfection , Nev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not counting the plucky visiting geologist ( Finn Carter ) , but it has all the social stratums a movie needs to make funky , glancing social commentary , rather in the manner of a country-and-western song . The entire upper class is represented by a survivalist couple ( well played by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire ) eager to employ their expensive arsenal against something , anything . The middle class , all four of them , is variously unaware , unconcerned and unprepared for emergency . Populism being the operative spirit of this genre , it is up to Perfection 's two-man lower class , Val and Earl ( adorable Kevin Bacon and solid Fred Ward ) , to get their betters organized . They make their living doing odd jobs , bicker laconically , dream of urban glamour , ca n't imagine how to obtain it . But staring into a graboid 's gaping mouth , they 're the kind of guys  --  resourceful , practical , unflappable  --  you want on your side . <P> And for all those staring into an empty January evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lurking out there and rarely is . Shrewdly , unpretentiously written , energetically directed and played with high comic conviction , Tremors is bound to become a cult classic .
