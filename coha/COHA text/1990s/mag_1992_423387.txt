<p> In fall , when gardening chores are winding down , it 's a good idea to button up your garden for winter . There are many things you can do , from improving the soil to fixing equipment , that will give you a better gardening season in 1993 . Here are some fall chores you can do to make yours the best garden in the neighborhood . <p> In the Garden <p> Was your gardening effort too large or too small for you and your family ? If it was too large , plan now to cut its size down . A garden plot 50 ft. x 50 ft. ( that 's 2500 sq . ft. ) is enough for a small family , but if you have a larger family , say five or more , then you 'll need a space 50 ft. x 100 ft. , or even larger , especially if you want to have vegetables to can or freeze , besides all the fresh ones you want to eat . If your food bill hurts your pocketbook , you can save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid test can tell you if you need to apply lime this fall . You can buy a simple soil test kit or have your extension agent do it for a small fee . Do n't get bogged down on a " complete soil analysis " - this can be a waste of time and money . To us , the " acid test " is the most important . Soil sweetness or sourness is measured by a pH yardstick . A pH of 7 means the soil is neutral , neither sweet nor sour . A soil with a pH below 7 is acid or sour , and one with a pH above 7 is alkaline or sweet . If your soil runs a bit acid ( 5.6 or so ) it 's good for almost everything . If your garden or lawn is producing well , you do n't need a test . Carrots and beets are good indicators ... if they grow well , you do n't need lime . Lime is a good way to raise the pH of your soil and acid-forming fertilizer containing aluminum sulfate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lime or fertilizer can be added now so fall rains and snow can work it into the root zone by spring . Lime will stretch your fertilizer dollars because it works as a team with " plant foods " to produce better plants . Ask the employees at your garden center about fertilizers . <p> If you burn wood in the fireplace , save the wood ashes for the lawn and garden . They are a good substitute for lime and are just as effective . You can overdo them , so be sure to test the soil each fall to see if the soil is acid or alkaline . If you have acid-loving plants around the home , such as azaleas , rhododendrons , mountain laurel , blueberries , training arbutus , trilliums , and most lilies , do not use wood ashes or lime on them . Lime ( alkaline soil ) causes these plants to become chlorotic ( yellowed ) and die . <p> A fair rule of thumb : if no lime has been added during the past four years , you can add about 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready treatment . <p> Clay Soils . If you spent a lot of time fighting a clay soil , fall 's a good time to tame it . Remember , a clay soil is heavy because it has finer particles in it than a sandy or light soil . By loosening it up , you can make a clay soil " breathe " so it will be well aerated and more productive . To loosen up a tight clay soil , you can use various homemade soil conditioners such as lawn clippings , leaves , garbage , compost , coal and wood ashes , sawdust , peatmoss , woodchips , or any other organic matter . Humus opens the clay and encourages earthworms to be more active helpers . The earthworms in a single acre may pass more than 10 tons of dry earth through their bodies annually . They mix organic matter thoroughly with the subsoil in the process . Lime also has a loosening effect on a heavy clay soil , coagulating the fine particles into larger ones , allowing air and water to pass freely . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or wood ash ) to heavy soils because it breaks down slowly and the clay has a buffer effect , preventing the calcium in limestone from making the soil alkaline , even when large quantities are used . <p> Sandy Soil . If your soil was too sandy and allowed water to drain out fast , you can do something about it now . Fortunately , practices that help loosen up a heavy soil will also tighten a sandy soil . The correct way to handle a sandy soil is to add organic matter in any form , since it acts like a blotter , holding moisture and nutrients . <p> Fall Cleanup . You can do a lot to prevent insect and disease buildup by giving your garden a good fall cleanup . Pull up vines and stalks and chop them up fine for the compost . This exposes overwintering stages of insects and diseases and helps cut down on them for next year . If you 've got the time , spade , fork , or plow the vegetable garden in fall to expose dormant stages of insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover crop " refers to a temporary planting made to add organic matter to the soil . Cover crops hold nitrogen and other nutrients that might be lost during the winter . Their tremendous root systems loosen heavy soils , whereas the added humus will help hold the particles of sandy soils together . If you have plenty of garden space , rotate 1/3 to 1/2 of it into a cover crop for a full year . These " green manure " crops , a good substitute for barnyard manure , include oats , buckwheat , clover , and ryegrass . You can sow these and let them grow right up until freezing weather , then spade or plow them under the following spring . <p> Perennials . Do n't hesitate to cut back perennials that are lanky and overgrown . Some are weedy and seedy , so cut them before they self SOW . <p> Bulbs . Fall is bulb planting time . The subject is so vast we can not cover it here because there are both indoor ( non-hardy ) and outdoor bulbs . You can learn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best varieties in your area . For outdoor plants , a good rule of thumb is that bulbs should be planted twice as deep as they are round . Do n't hesitate to write us if you have any problems for the fall care of bulbs . <p> Protecting Your Trees <p> Fall Planting . Nurseries are plugging " fall planting " as a way to save a year on growth , and to achieve better results than spring planting . If you plant evergreens or non-evergreens in the fall , make sure the plants are well watered , then mulched . Any plants going into the winter with a dry soil will surely perish from the effects of wind and sun . Soak them well . It 's a good idea to use a wrap around trees to prevent winter scald . <p> Water Loss . Many people think summer is the only time to put on a mulch , but winter mulch is also useful . One reason evergreens experience " winterburn " or " winterkill " is strong , drying winds in winter or early spring . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When water lost from the leaves can not be immediately replaced , drying out and browning of leaves takes place . Even though water is present in the soil , it may be frozen solid , and therefore unavailable to plant roots . The secret is to keep evergreens well watered right up until the snow flies . <p> Fall is a good , time to apply a winter mulch to help retain moisture in the soil and prevent rapid temperature changes at the soil line . Put two or three inches of straw , peatmoss , cocoabean shell , buckwheat hulls , wood chips , or sawdust around the base of your shrubs . Anything you have available for a mulch will work , but you should never let evergreens go into the winter with a dry soil . Give your plants a good soaking , then apply the mulch , to trap the water in . <p> Another idea homeowners like is " wilt-proofing " or spraying evergreens with latex concoctions found in garden centers . These seal the pores and stop water loss . These materials are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade names . Spray the top and bottom sides of leaves in late fall . Trunks of established trees can be painted with a cheap grade of latex paint , to a height of six feet . The paint reflects the sun 's rays and prevents unequal expansion , leaving cracked bark , especially on the southwest side of the trunk . <p> This is called " Southwest injury . " Paint the bark , using the paint full strength . <p> Newly planted evergreens , or those in exposed windy or sunny areas can also be protected by a burlap " tent " or screen . Burlap wrapped around four posts driven into the ground does a fine job of protecting the plants from drying winds . There are new loose-weave " landscape " fabrics which may be substituted for burlap as long as they are able to withstand the rigors of stormy weather . Never wrap evergreens with plastic sheets . These trap the heat in and cook the foliage on sunny days . Even holes punched in the plastic are not enough to let the heat escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sun 's rays . First , they are hit directly , then again as the sun 's rays bounce back from the white surface . Burlap or latex sprays lessen this type of injury . <p> Evergreens facing the west , and those next to a road , can get wind and salt damage . Salt burns cause browning , especially on the west side . This can be prevented by using burlap screens . Brown areas at the base are usually due to " dog burn . " Put a wire guard around the evergreens now to prevent dog burning . Water from leaking eaves can cause ice to form on evergreens , and the ice acts like a magnifying glass when the sun hits , scorching the foliage in cold weather . Damage shows as a bleached or strawlike color . Fix your gutters and make sure they are unplugged . Leaves can block the openings and cause water to splash over . <p> There 's another chore you can do in fall to prevent winter-killing . Make sure your evergreens , especially Taxus ( Japanese Yews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to " wet feet " and will die , often within 36 hours , if water remains around the roots . <p> Fruit Trees . Fall is an ideal time to plant fruit trees , and to trim them . Rabbits are a real problem for young fruit trees . Protect your trees in fall by wrapping the trunk in aluminum foil or hardware " cloth " ( screen ) . Make sure you go up two or three feet if you live where there are heavy snows and down about two inches into the soil to keep out voles ( repeat , voles ) and other rodents . Deer are a real problem in fall . If deer , rabbits , woodchucks , squirrels , and other animals bother your plants try this repellent : 2 whole eggs ( can include shells ) ; 2 cups coarsely chopped green onion tops ; 2 cloves garlic ( or garlic powder ) , 1 tablespoon red pepper ( chili or cayenne ) , 2 cups water . Place all in a kitchen blender . Run on high speed until everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved cake of yellow laundry soap ( found in supermarkets and sometimes called " fels Naphtha " ) . Fill with lukewarm water and stir . Splash by hand ( wear a rubber glove ) over plants . Reapply after heavy rain and every week or two . Once dry , it has no smell to humans . <p> Shaping Up the Lawn <p> Fall is , by far , the best time to seed a lawn , or patch up an old one . In most climates , the ideal time for sowing seed and for early growth of seedling grass is between the last part of September and the early part of November . This is the time nature itself selects for seeding . Fall grass seedlings will be vigorous for the following spring and will be better able to withstand the heat and weeds which come in summer . If your lawn is thin and has bald spots , " thicken " it with grass seed in fall . Mow your lawn right up until snow flies or cold winter sets in . Forget the notion that tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter will be susceptible to various fungus diseases such as mold and/or helminsoporum . <p> Lawn Mower Care . It 's a safe bet that 9 out of 10 CR readers have a lawn mower in the garage with a dull blade . When you get ready to put that lawn mower away , do this 1 ) Put in a new spark plug . They cost only about $1.50 and can save you a ton of tugging next year . 2 ) Unhook the wire to the spark plug , * take the blade off and have it sharpened for next year . Dull blades cause " gray " lawns by beating the grass off instead of cutting it . 3 ) Change the oil in fall instead of waiting until a busy spring rolls around . 4 ) Drain the gas out of the tank . It can turn into varnish-like material and cause problems in spring . <p> House Plants <p> Fall 's no time to neglect house plants . If you kept yours outdoors in summer bring them indoors . Keep them isolated for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white flies , and other pests . You might spray them with a homemade spray formula you can mix right in your own sink with common household ingredients . <p> To make : mix one teaspoon of liquid detergent ( dishwashing type such as Palmolive , Ivory , Joy , etc. ) with one cup to one quart of plain tap water . Shake this mixture vigorously to emulsify and pour it into a spray or pump bottle . Use at 10-day intervals to cheek white flies , spider mites , and aphids . A lot of people use Murphy 's oil soap ( liquid ) diluted at a rate of 1/4 cup to a gallon of warm water . Spray it on top and undersides of foliage . <p> Potting Sail . Fall is a good time to re-pot most house plants . A good soil mixture for most house plants is made up of one part sphagnum peat moss ( or compost ) , one part sand , one part garden loam , and one part perlite or vermiculite . Many , ' store bought " black potting mixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drain well . If your plants are tall and gangly , prune them back and start new plants from cuttings rooted in a vase of soupy perlite . <p> <p> It 's important to unhook the wire to the plug before you loosen the blade . It 's possible for the mower to start when you turn the blade and cause serious injury . <p> By Doc and Katy Abraham <p> <p> Mr. and Mrs. Abraham are CR 's garden editors . They recently released an updated version of their book , The Green Thumb Garden Handbook , published by Lyons &; Burford . <p> HOW TO MAKE USE OF FALLEN LEAVES <p> One of the best materials for the compost is leaves . Fall should n't be a time when burning leaves clog your nostrils . These organic materials should not be discarded but placed on the compost pile , which is like putting money into the barn . In a compost pile , you can alternate leaves with grass clippings , sawdust , soil , garbage , and other materials , and a scattering of lime and plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sheet of black polyethylene . The beauty of plastic is that you do not have to fork or turn over the compost . Leave it alone for six or eight months and you 'll find the plastic hastens decay by trapping the heat inside and preventing loss of moisture . <p> Subsoil can hold a mere 20% of its weight , good topsoil will hold 60% , but leaf mold can retain 300% to 500% of its weight in water . Leaf mold from non-evergreens is richer in nutrients than that of conifers . They are all good property so do n't believe the story that leaves are harmful to plants . Oak leaves are acid and are recommended for acid-loving plants . Yet , they are still usable for non-acid plants . <p> Some gardeners do not like to make compost because of the danger of infecting the pile with plant diseases and insect pests . There are some materials that should be avoided , and these include iris leaves , ( if borers have been a problem ) and peony tops if botrytis blight blasted the buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cabbage and other crucifers ( cabbage family ) , and cornstalks if borers or smut were present . If a compost is allowed to stand for one or two seasons with occasional forking over , it 's doubtful if diseases and insects will persist any more than they do in the garden where plants have been grown for years . Flies may congregate , but a plastic sheet keeps them out , as it will a stray dog or two . <p> Regardless of how you make compost , there is no magical material that converts raw organic matter into humus overnight . Compost may not replace fertilizer , although many gardeners use it without adding any extra nutrients . <p>
