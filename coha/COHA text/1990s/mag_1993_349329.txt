John Hammond is a man in love with an idea . Inspired by motives of applied science and pure profit , he has pursued a scheme to clone dinosaurs from their preserved dna and show off the brand-new behemoths on an island preserve . He has imperiled some noted scientists , and even his two young grandchildren , by inviting them to inspect the park before it is ready . Dino disaster awaits . <P> Hammond might be an ogre , twisting genetic research into capitalist exploitation , creating the ultimate carnival sideshow , where the freaks eat the gawkers . That is pretty much how Michael Crichton sketched the old man in the novel Jurassic Park . But the Hammond played by Richard Attenborough in Steven Spielberg 's movie version is another fellow altogether ; the director calls him " a cross between Walt Disney and Ross Perot . " Hammond is certainly a visionary , a fabulous showman , an enthusiast , an emperor of ice cream , a kid with a great new toy . " Top of the line ! " he chirps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Spielberg as a foxy grandpa . <P> Top of the line ? Jurassic Park , like every other Spielberg movie , is couture for the masses : a cunning design , elegantly tailored . Spared no expense ? Just ask the picture 's sponsor , Universal , which has not had a $100 million winner at the domestic box office since 1989 ( with the Spielberg-produced Back to the Future Part II ) and urgently needs a megahit . Hence the marketing tie-in with McDonald 's , the imminent Jurassic Park ride at Universal 's theme parks , and the saturation of action figures , jammies and cologne . The director did cut costs with a decent , modest cast of nonstars , and he tried shooting every dialogue scene in no more than five takes . But the expert exertions of the 483 other artists and technicians listed in the credits ensured that Jurassic Park would cost about $65 million , or $1 for every year since dinosaurs became extinct . <P> But enough money talk . This is a monster movie . So how are they ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a time , before mammal walked or man dreamed . You can pet a triceratops and , if you wish , examine its droppings . You can feed a vegetarian brachiosaur , whose movements are graceful , endearing . At times the beasts ( animated , mostly , by the computer - sorcerers from Industrial Light &; Magic ) move in a hazier space than the humans in the foreground , but in the intimate scenes the dinos are utterly convincing . Spielberg loves to mix wonder with horror , and he has fun creating a living Museum of Natural Fantasy . <P> Then he scares you witless . Here come a nosy tyrannosaur and a fan-faced , bilious dilophosaur . Nastiest of all are the velociraptors , smart , relentless punks in packs  --  Saurz N the Hood . They have a special appetite for kids , just like the great white shark in the movie that made Spielberg 's rep . Now it has some worthy successors : primeval creatures with personality and a lot of bite . Jurassic Park is the true Jaws II .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
