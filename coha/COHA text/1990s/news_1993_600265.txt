<p> David Bowie is the man who explored the musical cosmos . And The Man Who Fell to Earth . He was glam rock 's androgynous prince . A cross-dressing pioneer of rock theatrics . The Thin White Duke of decadence . And a master of Sybil-like identity ch-ch-changes , singing about life on Mars one moment and dueting with Bing Crosby the next . <p> So where is pop 's favorite space oddity today ? Down to earth . <p> " It came out of left field , " Bowie says of the warmth and romance on his highly personal album , Black Tie White Noise , out today . Ensconced in a swanky Beverly Hills hotel suite , Bowie appears cool and elegant , wearing impeccable attire and a generous smile made slightly sinister by his dilated left pupil ( injured in childhood ) . He 's relaxed , cheerful and eager to discuss his first solo album in six years and the first since two modest-selling albums by his on-hiatus rock quartet , Tin Machine . <p> " I 'm quite surprised by what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 46 , who 's released 30-plus albums since 1967 . " This is the least-perplexing album that I 've ever written . " <p> Black Tie is a bustling intersection of jazz , dance , funk , R &B; and rock . Bowie and Nile Rodgers , who produced 1983 's Let 's Dance ( Bowie 's best-selling album ) , have fashioned an intoxicating sound that is as sophisticated as it is recklessly experimental . Squalling horns replace electric guitars . Idiosyncratic arrangements , genre-bending and dramatic vocals boost the thrill count . <p> Bowie has chosen this sonic house of mirrors to reflect his most revealing lyrics to date . Current single Jump They Say , with a creepy sax riff played backward , was inspired by Bowie 's stepbrother , Terry , an institutionalized schizophrenic who killed himself in 1986 . <p> " It was something I 'd not been able to address for many years , " Bowie says . " It 's vaguely my impressions of how I felt about him , and also about my own dilemma : am I stumbling through any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental illness in my family . " <p> Are the two at opposite ends of a theorized link between mental illness and creative genius ? Bowie says , " I often wondered how Terry 's life would have changed if he were by nature artistic , if it would have released some of the demons . " <p> The album hits happier notes in songs devoted to Bowie 's wife , supermodel Iman , 37 . Three songs were originally penned for their 1992 wedding in Lausanne , Switzerland , where they now live . <p> " Iman 's family is Muslim and mine is Protestant , " he says , " and we were marrying in a Catholic church , so I had to work out something that was not going to offend anybody . " <p> The album opens with The Wedding , an uplifting instrumental with church bells , and closes with The Wedding Song , a tender , romantic ballad . Those and other sentimental moments reveal Bowie 's " commitment to a relationship I honestly and truly believe is there for the long haul . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also curtailed it . Bowie is n't planning a tour . <p> " The last thing you need to do is get married and disappear for 10 months , " he says . " A couple of years ago , I had to resolve how much of my time was going to be devoted to work and how much to my relationship , because I realized that I was a real workaholic . I 'm so fulfilled and happy in this relationship that I do n't want it to crumble . I want to do everything in my power to make a go of it . " <p> He and Iman were introduced by a mutual friend who spotted key similarities . <p> " We both had broken marriages , ' Bowie says . " We both had children , we had a certain success quota in our respective careers , we 'd been to similar places around the world and our circles of friends somewhat overlapped . " <p> And ? <p> " And I fell head over heels and was naming the children within seconds of meeting her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bowie has a son , 21 , from his marriage to Angela Bowie , whose tell-all bio , Backstage Passes : Life on the Wild Side With David Bowie , has been a source of annoyance since its release early this year . In it , she repeats her claim that she found Bowie and Mick Jagger in bed together . <p> " Shall we just let her dine out on these stories for the rest of her life ? " Bowie says crisply . " I do n't know . It 's that 15 minutes of stardom thing . I feel sad for her in some ways . " <p> Much of Backstage is embroidered cocktail chatter , he says , declining to enumerate the book 's inaccuracies . <p> " I have to take my son 's feelings into consideration , " Bowie says . " That 's why I refrain from discussing ( Angela ) publicly . I have absolutely nothing good to say about her either as a person or as a mother . " <p> He 'll pen an autobiography eventually , he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's assumed over his career . Once the master of masquerade , Bowie says he 's glad to be himself and let the past go . He retired most of his hits on a 1990 retrospective tour . <p> " The biggest hurdle was getting over being expected to do something completely different every time , " he says . " It was fun to out-anticipate everyone else . They never knew what I was gon na do next , and frankly nor did I. <p> " But by the mid- ' 80s , I ran out of steam in that area . This album feels as though I 'm utilizing everything I have learned as a musician . All the musical styles I 've played around with have at last become something that is wholly and totally mine . " <p> The title track touches on last year 's riots in Los Angeles . He and Iman arrived in L.A. the day the Rodney King beating verdict was announced . <p> " We were with everyone else : in the supermarket buying up fast and furiously . It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a potential revolution which may well explode again . Integration ai n't gon na come easy . " <p> The album includes covers of Morrissey 's I Know It 's Gon na Happen Someday and Cream 's I Feel Free , which Bowie 's Spiders From Mars played as an encore in 1972 . Bowie plays sax on the latter . <p> " I have Bill Clinton 's technique , but I have the enthusiasm of John Coltrane , " he says . " I get wildly , madly excited about playing the saxophone . I overcame any shortcomings by treating the sax the way punks treated their guitar playing . I put it through lots of devices and distorted the sound . " <p> A Bowie idol , famed jazz trumpeter Lester Bowie ( no relation ) , plays on several tracks . <p> " I adored working with Lester , " Bowie says . " He 's totally out of control ! He 's very much part of the Miles Davis tradition of doing exactly what he wants when he wants . " <p> That was Bowie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his albums , shows and videos ( from storyboard to costumes to lighting ) . <p> " Then I learned it 's OK to let go , " Bowie says . " If you try to control every moment of your day , you 're on an auto-destructive course . <p> " Nowadays , I realize that my opinions might not be the most important opinions . I 'll admit I have opinions on everything , but now I do n't feel they have to color or inform every damn conversation . "
