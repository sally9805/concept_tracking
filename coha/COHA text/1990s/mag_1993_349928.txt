The kids get it right away . Nobody has to explain to a 10-year-old boy what 's so great about video games . Just sit him down in front of a Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo machine , shove a cartridge into the slot and he 's gone  --  body , mind and soul  --  into a make-believe world that 's better than sleep , better than supper and a heck of a lot better than school . <P> Grownups , as a rule , do n't get it . Which may be why the video-game craze has been seen by most adults  --  including the captains of the entertainment industry  --  as a dead end . For 20 years they have watched the advent of Pong and Pac-man , the rise and fall of Atari , the arrival of the Japanese , and have dismissed videogaming as a temporary detour far removed from the mainstream of modern American culture  --  which is to say , movies and prime-time television . <P> Until now . What once seemed like a passing fad for preteen boys has grown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most creative talents in Hollywood and tapping the coffers of media and communications conglomerates eager to get in on the action . Video games rake in $5.3 billion a year in the U.S. alone , about $400 million more than Americans spend going to the movies . Globally , game revenues exceed $10 billion each year , and the worldwide sales of a single hit can top $500 million . Last week players from Times Square to Paris to Tokyo queued up in stores to buy Mortal Kombat , one of the hottest ( and most violent ) games ever made . In the next few weeks , Disney/MGM will release the game version of Aladdin ; Propaganda Films will debut Voyeur , a new kind of adult-oriented interactive movie ; and a start-up company named 3DO will launch the riskiest merger of games and multimedia yet , with a $699 superpowered machine designed to blast the market into new levels of graphic reality and financial risk . <P> The video-game industry is being propelled forward by a technological imperative that is reshaping most forms of entertainment . America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tele-Communications Inc. and the proposed Paramount-Viacom combo  --  are spending billions to turn today 's passive television broadcast system into a two-way , interactive information highway capable of delivering not just movies , sitcoms and news on demand , but the world 's greatest video games as well . <P> Suddenly a new medium  --  and a new market opportunity  --  has opened up in the place where Hollywood , Silicon Valley and the information highway intersect . Games are part of a rapidly evolving world of interactive amusements so new that nobody knows what to call them : Multimedia ? Interactive motion pictures ? The New Hollywood ? And like the proverbial blind men feeling their way around the elephant , everybody involved in it has a different idea of what this lucrative beast is , depending on what part of it touches them . Hollywood executives tend to see the emerging market as a way to distribute movies and TV shows . Computer types see it as a way to get their machines into every home . Cable TV companies see it as a Pied Piper that will lure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get their parents to pay for pricey service connections and set-top cable boxes that might otherwise seem intimidating .
