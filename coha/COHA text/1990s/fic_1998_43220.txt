Mary Rosenblum is currently working on a mystery series set in Hood River , Oregon . The first novel , Devil 's Trumpet is due out in about six months . Mary calls this new story an example of American Magic Realism , " but it seems to me we need a better term , something akin to " Southern Gothic " that could apply to stories of the Pacific Northwest ( like the recent novels of Nina Hoffman and Jack Cady ) . Hmm , that 's a bit of a stumper . Fortunately for us all , we do n't need labels to enjoy poignant stories like this one that explore classic American myths . <p> " SO HE 'S A FRAUD ? " DAD SAID . " Well , have you ever heard of a genuine rain-maker ? " Uncle Kenny cut a neat triangle out of his stack of pancakes . " Sandy , I swear these could be Mom 's hotcakes . I never could get " em right . " " You 'd say anything for a free breakfast , little brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , and she flipped three more of the browned cakes onto a plate . " Better eat these , Donny , before your uncle talks me out of " em . So how come you do n't arrest this man , if he 's a fraud ? You 're the Sheriff . " She planted her hands on her hips . " It 's a crime , cheating folks around here . Who has any money to waste , with the cattle market so bad ? " " We sure as hell do n't . " Dad pushed his chair back . " Got to check those heifers . " He reached for his hat . " We 're gon na run out of pasture in about two weeks , " he said in a tired voice . " Guess I 'll have to ship a bunch out , in spite of the beef prices . Once they start losing weight , I wo n't get squat for " em anyhow . " " Hey , you could hire this rainmaker . " Uncle Kenny speared the last sticky forkful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I kind of wish I could . " Dad was n't smiling . For a moment he held Uncle Kenny 's narrow stare , then he turned away . My uncle shook his head . " John sounds like he wants to get religion . " He laughed . " Do n't , Kenny . " Mom was collecting dishes . " It 's tough right now . " " It 's always tough for him , is n't it ? This rainmaker dude is slick . " He changed the subject abruptly . " He does n't promise anything . Not in writing , anyway . If folks want to be stupid and give him money , it 's not a crime . " " He 's trading on faith . " Mom 's face had gotten tight . " That 's a sin , even if it 's not a crime . " " I sure agree with you . " Uncle Kenny sighed , and kissed her as he got to his feet . " Wish you made the laws , Sis . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ready to ride ? " Mom was looking at me , and I had to say yes . I 'd been just about willing to kill to ride with Uncle Kenny , sitting shotgun beside him as he tooled the green and white Sheriff 's Department Jeep through the sage that was mostly what makes up Hamey County . Everybody liked Uncle Kenny . It used to make me feel real important , seeing how respectful everyone treated him . I licked my lips , trying to think of an excuse not to go . " Sure , " I finally said , and pretended not to notice Mom 's eyes get narrow . " You 'll make a good deputy , kid . " He slapped me on the shoulder hard enough to hurt . " Let 's go . " Uncle Kenny put his sunglasses on when he got into the car . I did n't say much as we drove back into town . It was hot , and I had the window down all the way , but the July heat washed over me , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The high school . A few streets on either side of highway 20 . A lot of sage beyond that , in gray-green clumps . You got rocks , too , and dust the color of a buckskin mustang 's hide . I saw a ghost in the distance , just walking through the sage . He was carrying a bucket . I see them a lot - the ghosts . Sometimes I think the desert preserves them , like it does the old homesteaders " cabins that are scattered all through the sage . Or maybe the ghosts are everywhere , but it 's just easier to see them out here . I told my mom about them when I was six . She went in the bedroom and cried , after . I heard her through the door . I never talked about " em after that . They do n't pay us any attention anyway . I wonder if they even know we 're here ? " You 're sure talkative , " Uncle Kenny spoke up . " Ca n't shut you up for a second . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " I could feel his eyes on me , but I could n't stop looking at the ghost . " Maybe we need to talk , " he said in a real quiet voice . I sneaked a quick look at him then , and yeah he was looking at me . I stared at my twin faces in the mirrored surface of his glasses , and my stomach kind of folded in on itself , so I could feel the lump of the pancakes I 'd eaten . Then his head jerked a little and he turned sharp without warning , so that I had to grab the door . We were pulling into the parking lot of the motel across the street from the high school , tires squealing . No siren . This was Wednesday in late July . The lot should have been empty too early in the day for the truckers to be stopping , or the folks passing through on their way to somewhere else . But it was full - so full that Uncle Kenny pulled up behind two big Ford rigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . A green and orange patio umbrella stuck up over the crowd at the back of the lot , out where the asphalt left off and the sage began . Everybody was back there , crowding around like it was a booth at the county fair . " Let 's go , Donny . " Uncle Kenny threw off his seatbelt like he was mad . " Time to further your education . " Relieved , I scrambled out after , wondering if I could find someone I knew and get myself invited over for the afternoon . Uncle Kenny would buy that . The crowd around the umbrella parted to let my uncle through , and I followed , looking hard for a face ... any face . I saw a bunch of people I knew - Mr. Franke , who managed the Thriftway , and the lady who always worked the cash register at the Payless . No kids , though . Then I saw Mrs. Kramer , my English teacher . I stopped short , like I was skipping school , even though it was summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue jeans like anybody , with my uncle pushing past her . " We see the world clearly , when we 're children . " A man 's rich voice rose over the murmur of the crowd . It sounded like velvet feels and it sent shivers down my back . " When we 're very young , we believe what we see . It 's only as we grow up that we learn to doubt - to disbelieve the things that we once knew were real . When we were children , we knew we could summon the rain - or wish it away . " " I do n't remember making it rain . " Mrs. Kramer spoke up in her latehomework tone and I craned my neck trying to see , because I bet that guy was cringing . " Our yesterdays change to suit today 's belief . " The man sounded like he was smiling . " Have n't you ever listened to the arguments at a family reunion ? You do n't really need me , but if you ca n't remember how to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I forgot about Uncle Kenny and pushed forward , not even noticing who I was shouldering past . The man 's words made me shiver again inside this time , like taking too deep a breath of frosty winter air . I was waiting for Mrs. Kramer to cut him off at the knees , like she does when you tell her how the goat ate your homework , but she did n't say anything . " You got a vendor permit , mister ? " Uncle Kenny spoke quietly , but everybody stopped talking right away . He was like that . He could walk into a noisy bar and talk in a normal voice and everybody would shut up to hear him . " You got to have a permit to peddle stuff in this town . " He stepped forward , and I could see the man now , squinting from the umbrella 's shade . He did n't look like he sounded . He was small , kind of soft and pudgy , with a round sweating face and black hair that Mom would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . " I 'm sorry , Sheriff . " He spread his hands . " I did n't know I needed a permit to talk . " " Folks work hard for their money around here . " My uncle hooked his thumbs in his gun belt . " The government takes a big bite and maybe , if beef prices are high enough , we can pay the mortgage and feed our kids on what 's left . " He paused , looking around at the faces that surrounded him . Everybody had moved back a little , making a ring , like you do when there 's a fight out behind the gym . " What you do should be against the law . " He turned his attention back to the little man . " It is n't , but we do n't have to put up with your slimy kind . " He let his fingers curl loosely over the top of his bolstered .44 . The little man nodded at the gun , his lips pursed . " Are you threatening to beat me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The silence around us got real tight and I looked away , thinking of the winter night when I had watched through the steamed-up windshield as Uncle Kenny beat up this ranch hand who 'd been starting a lot of ugly bar fights in town . " Sometimes you got to know the right language , " he had said when he returned to the car . He had wiped the blood from his hands carefully on a towel he pulled from under his seat . " Jail does n't scare his kind much . But now-he 'll mind his manners . I 'm just tryin " to save him from knifing somebody one night , and getting himself a prison sentence for it . " I 'd believed him . I watched my uncle 's lips tighten . " Tell you what , " he said in a hard voice . " You 're so sure you 're God 's messenger , Mister Rainmaker , let 's make a little wager . You make it rain on my place , I 'll pay triple your fee . " He tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard sky . Not a cloud anywhere-not even a wisp of cirrus . " It do n't rain , then you move on and do n't ever set foot in Harney County again . " He lowered his head , his eyes as hard as the sky . " You willing to put it on the line , Rainmaker ? " " Whatever you want . " The man shrugged . " But I do n't make rain . I just call it . " " How " bout you call it right now ? " " I can start right now . " The Rainmaker pursed his lips into a little frown . " It takes time for weather to happen . I do n't do Hollywood special effects . We 're talking a shift in the jet stream , cold fronts and warm fronts . Big masses of air and moisture . Takes time to move that much around . " " Yeah , got you . " Uncle Kenny turned around slow , talking to the crowd now . " So if it rains sometime next Christmas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how it works ? " People laughed , but the clear space got bigger around the umbrella and the little man . Only Ms. Kramer did n't move . " I do n't think my cows can wait till Christmas , " someone said . " It wo n't take that long . " The man answered solemnly , as if Uncle Kenny had asked a real question . " Couple of days - maybe four . " He shrugged . " When it gets close , I 'll let you know . " " And it 'll rain right on my land , huh ? Just there ? " " Why not our south pasture ? " I spoke up . " Grass 'd sprout in a couple of days back there if it rained . Dad could put the heifers in instead of sellin " " em . " I looked at my uncle . " You do n't have any cattle . You do n't need the rain . " " Good idea . " Hiram Belker , our neighbor to the east , spoke up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll land on my back forty . " He guffawed - was answered by more laughter . " Why not ? " Uncle Kenny slid his sunglasses into place and turned his shiny mirrored gaze on me . " Hell , do my poor brother-in-law a favor . We 'll make it a public event . I 'll put up a notice on the bulletin board in the Courthouse lobby when our wizard here decides the rain 's comin ' . We can party . " He grinned around at the crowd . " Do n't forget your umbrellas , folks . " He turned away and people turned with him , like he 'd given an order . I looked to see if the Rainmaker. was mad about that , but he just looked tired . He noticed me looking and gave me a small smile . I smiled back , wondering how he meant to do it , then flinched as my uncle 's hand landed hard on my shoulder . " How " bout we go get a burger , Donny-boy ? We can watch for the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early for lunch . " My voice sounded squeaky . He opened his mouth to reply , but just then one of my uncle 's deputies tapped him on the shoulder . " Kenny ? Ronny Carter just called in . " He shook a Marlboro out of the squashed pack in his uniform pocket . " You 'll never guess what he found out in the sage on his summer range over by White Horse Creek ? The Rojas kid 's old beater Chevy . " " Is he sure it 's Rojas 's ? " Uncle Kenny pushed his hat back on his head . " I thought he took off to Mexico to visit his mother , way back in November . Did he find a body ? " " Nope . " The deputy dragged on his cigarette and blew out a blue lungful of smoke . " Found the registration . Coyotes had all winter . " Uncle Kenny turned to me . " Let 's go , Donny-boy . " " Excuse me . " The Rainmaker had finished folding his umbrella . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed dust carefully from gray slacks that looked prissy alongside the jeans everybody else pretty much wore . " Perhaps your nephew could show me where you expect this rain to fall ? Or are you free to escort me ? " " Sure , " I said , before Uncle Kenny could say anything . " I 'll show you . " Uncle Kenny just looked at me , long and hard , and then shrugged and spat . " Whatever you want , kid . " He turned his back on us , and walked off with his deputy . The motel lot was almost empty now . The crowd had left a scatter of crumpled burger wrappers , pop cups , and cigarette butts to mark where it had been . I remembered our one trip to the beach , when I was eight- how the tide had left the same litter of dead seaweed , trash , and broken shells on the clean white sand . I 'd found a dead seal , all bloated , with empty eye sockets and grinning yellow teeth . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , but they were there . " What 's your name ? " The Rainmaker was looking at me with this thoughtful sort of expression . " Donald , " I said . " Dimitri . " He offered me a pudgy hand and I shook it solemnly . Dimitri sounded foreign . Russian or something . " Saturday hours are precious ones , " he went on . " Thank you forgiving up a few of them for me . Here . " He handed me the folded umbrella , nodded at a dusty blue Dodge Caravan parked on the far side of the lot . It was n't a good car for the desert . But when he opened the back , I saw camping gear , some canned stuff in a box , and a couple of five-gallon water jugs . Full . Okay , he was n't stupid anyway . I got into the front seat beside him , wondering how he 'd explain it when the rain did n't come . " What ? " I said , when he just sat there staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Mom ever nagged me about the seatbelt . " Left on Highway Twenty , " I said . " Take the first right after the gas station . " He turned the key , frowned as the engine sputtered . When it finally caught , he gunned it and pulled out of the motel lot . Clogged fuel injectors , I wanted to tell him . Pour some cleaner in the gas tank before you have to pay to get " em fixed . " Turn here , " I said , when we got to the track that led back to our spring pasture . " I 'll get the gate . " A ghost was walking along the fence line as if he was checking the wire . He had a weathered face and wore tattered work pants held up by suspenders . I waited until he passed by before I unhooked the wire gate and pulled it aside . When I climbed back into the front seat , the Rainmaker was staring at the place where the ghost had vanished . He looked at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced slowly along the track . Something metal was rattling in the back . Pots and pans , sounded like . " Do you really call the weather ? " I licked my dry lips , wishing he 'd go faster so we 'd get a breeze . " Or are you a phony ? " " That 's a refreshingly direct question . " He chuckled . " Your uncle thinks I 'm a phony . " We topped a rise and the Rainmaker halted the car . Turned off the engine and opened the door . " This feels like a good place , " he said . He walked away from me and stopped right on the edge of the slope . A pronghorn lifted her head from the sage , eyed us for a second , then trotted slowly away , her white sides flashing in the scorching sun . I wiped my face on my sleeve . I swear the Rainmaker was n't even sweating . He stood there , looking like he was standing on a city street , just staring out at the sage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time of year , dry as it was , there was n't any grass left to speak of . Just sage , and greasewood , and rabbit brush . I got out , too , thinking that this was stupid , that this guy was a scam , and he 'd wave his hands around , and then sneak off when nobody was looking . And I realized I was thinking all this in my uncle 's voice . So I quit . And just listened to the desert . It talks , you know . Real quiet - the sound of dust sifting against rock , and wind whispering through sage stems , sand shifting under a mule deer 's hoof or a jackrabbit 's paws . It does n't notice us much . I told Mom about that , too . Once . She did n't cry , but it bothered her . I could tell . The Rainmaker stood there in the blazing sun , arms at his sides , just staring into space with this kind of distant look on his face . And for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt something . It was like the air got solid . I do n't mean I could n't breathe or anything . But it was like I could feel it - the air , could feel the clouds in it , hung up and leaking on the Cascade Mountains , could feel the cool dampness beyond them where all that water evaporating from the summer ocean was pushing inward . And I could feel ... a weak spot . Where that nice damp air could push our way . A ground squirrel scuttled over my toes . I jumped back , startled , and lost the feeling . Figured I 'd just imagined it . I kicked a shower of dust after the vanished critter . Looked up to see the Rainmaker smiling at me . " Tomorrow evening , " he said , like he was agreeing with me . " We were lucky - finding that weakening in the high pressure ridge . " I nodded and swallowed . Because his eyes were older even than old Mr. Long 's , and he was a hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and now he just looked sad . " It 's tough to believe in what you see , " he said softly . " When everyone knows it ca n't be true . Come on . I 'll take you home . " I shivered , and did n't answer him as I got back into the car . He drove me back down the track , and then up the main driveway to our house . And it was n't until I had gotten out at the front door and he was driving away that I realized I 'd never told him where I lived . THE SKY WAS CLEAR that night , with just a sliver of a moon , and the Milky Way swept a white path across the sky , so clear that you could believe that it was a road , like in the old Indian tales , where you could ride a horse up it , right up into that sky . " Hey , it 's gon na rain tomorrow . " Uncle Kenny had dropped by for dinner , like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell ? " " I 'd sure take it , if it came . " Dad popped another beer . " Hell , I 'd pay the man . " He helped himself to a slice of meat loaf with a grunt . " Pass me the potatoes , will you , Sandy ? " " Did I tell you we found the Rojas kid 's car ? " Uncle Kenny said . " Back along White Horse Creek . " He reached for the meat loaf . " I guess the coyotes cleaned things up . " " Julio ? " Mom paused , the steaming bowl of potatoes in her hand . " He went back to Oaxaca . To visit his mother . " " Guess not . " Uncle Kenny forked meatloaf onto his plate . " Drug deal gone bad , is my guess . " " No ! " " Do n't kid yourself , Sandy . " My uncle chewed , reached for his beer . " He was selling . Everybody knew it . " " Hard to believe . " Dad tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard worker , that kid . Worth his pay-and that 's rare enough these days . Kids do n't know how to work anymore . They grow up and figure that an hour with a shovel 'll kill " em . " He looked at Mom . " You gon na hold onto those all night ? " Mom looked down at the bowl in her hands . With a jerky movement , she set it in front of Dad . Then she carried her untouched plate into the kitchen . Uncle Kenny finished his dinner and went over to click through the TV channels . Dad opened another beer . I slipped out of the house and walked up the rise behind the bam . You could see over toward the spring range from up here . Julio used to sit on a rock that stuck out over the dry wash behind the bam and play his guitar . He taught me chords . He told me how it was , growing up in Mexico . I told him about the ghosts once . He told me that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're around . Same as us . I was about to go back to the house when I spotted a ghost walking along the lip of the wash . It disappeared near the rock where Julio used to sit . Early in the spring , I found some withered flowers on that rock . I went back to the house where Mom shoved a too-big piece of apple pie at me and did n't ask me where I 'd been . " Sky cloudin " up yet ? Smellin " rain in the air ? " Uncle Kenny laughed and forked pie into his mouth , but the look he gave me stung like the flick of a quirt . I told Mom I was tired , and went on up to bed . " He 's in love , " I heard Uncle Kenny say as I climbed the stairs . " He 's got all the signs . " I got onto the bed , but it was still hot up here , even with the fan on . I turned the light off and just lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I heard Mom 's footsteps on the stairs , I realized I 'd been waiting for her to come up . I pulled the sheet over me and sat up in the dark . She did n't turn on the light , and she did n't say anything , but I felt the edge of the bed sink . For a while we both just sat there . The air was thick with heat up here , and for a moment , I felt it again  --  clouds , rain , wind - like a giant quilt that was constantly changing , shifting , moving above us . " Uncle Kenny 's a good Sheriff , right ? " The words sort of came out on their own . I did n't mean to say anything , hoped she 'd let it pass . " Yes , he is . " She brushed the hair off my forehead , like she did when I was sick . " julio did n't do it , you know ? Sell drugs . He was so lonely . " Her voice faltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oaxaca . He made up songs for her on his guitar . What 's wrong , Donny ? " She had her hand under my chin now , so that I could n't look away from her . " What happened between you and Kenny ? " I swallowed , but the words had balled up in my throat . I could only shake my head , glad it was dark . " This is a hard place to live . " She stood up . " He 's a good man , Donny , even if he has to be hard , at times . Justice means everything to him . That 's why he 's good for the county . " I did n't have anything to say to that . She took her hand away after a while , and stood up without saying anything more . I lay on my back , staring up at the ceiling for a long time after she went downstairs . I heard my uncle drive away in his county Jeep , I heard my parents come upstairs to bed . Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mom said something in the tone she uses when a cow is having trouble calving . I waited until their door closed , then I got up and went to the window . It was cool outside now , and the stars still glittered . But as I leaned over the sill into the night , I could feel the distant rain pressing against the air , . pushing at it . It was on its way . I waked before the sun was up and left the house just as it got light . The eastern sky had gone pink and soft gray as I followed the wash down across the east pasture . When it rained , the steep-sided little canyon filled up with water . Fast . My dad and I had had to ride out in a freak storm one spring , to move cattle out from where they 'd holed up in the bottom , before it flooded . I remember that afternoon real well - lightning breaking across the sky in blue forks , rain falling in stinging sheets , the horses snorting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the willow brush in the bottom , not wanting to move . Uncle Kenny had showed up on his rangy black mustang to help , still in uniform because he was on duty . The three of us had finally gotten the twenty or so cows and calves started up the bank - just as a wave of brown water had come foaming down the bed . It had caught my pony , and he had reared , bellydeep in an instant . I knew we were goners . But then Uncle Kenny had grabbed the reins and hauled us both out of the flood . " Too cold for swimmin ' , " he 'd said , and laughed . I left the wash and climbed the slope , squinting at the first blaze of sun above the distant horizon . I stopped to get my breath on the ridge . Down below , near the highway fence , a dusty blue Dodge Caravan was parked by a crooked juniper . The Rainmaker was sitting on a little folding stool beside the car , a steaming mug in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood up as if he 'd been waiting for me to show . " You can tell me the good place for breakfast , " he said . The good place , he 'd said . I thought about that . " The Spur , " I said . The parking lot was crowded . The Rainmaker did n't say anything as he parked at the edge of the lot . He turned off the engine and started to open the door . " Can I do it ? " I said . My voice sounded too loud , or too soft , I was n't sure which . " Do what ? " He did n't turn around to look at me . " Call the rain . " I swallowed . " I can feel it coming . It 's gon na get here soon . " " Tonight . " He still did n't look at me . I thought he 'd be glad , but his shoulders drooped , the way Mom 's did when Dad had to take out the loan to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again for a minute . " You can do it . But once you do - you do n't live in the same world with everybody else anymore . Think about that . " He opened the door suddenly , letting in a gust of hot dusty wind . Got out . I wanted to ask him more - lots more - but he was n't going to answer me , so I did n't say anything as we went inside . It was crowded . The booths and formica-topped tables were mostly full and cigarette smoke drifted beneath the wagon-wheel lights with their yellow globes . It felt like evening instead of bright morning . And it got quiet while the waitress hustled us over to a table . I recognized a couple of faces from the motel parking lot yesterday . And Uncle Kenny was there-drinking coffee in his regular booth by the door where he could see the whole room . He was sitting with one of his deputies , and I could feel him looking at me as I walked past like I had n't seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the typed menu in its plastic sleeve . The words did n't make any sense , but I was n't hungry anyway . " Can I have coffee , please ? " I asked the impatient waitress . " And a cinnamon roll . " The Rainmaker ordered the breakfast special - steak and eggs with hashbrowns and toast . He looked up as the waitress bustled away and Uncle Kenny took her place . " Good morning , Sheriff . " He smiled a bland , kind of tired smile . " It ai n't raining . " Uncle Kenny pulled a chair out with a scrape that sounded way too loud in the utter silence that now filled the room . " So you chose up sides , huh , kid ? " From the corner of my eye , I caught a glimpse of movement . A grayhaired old man was making his way down the aisle with a check in his hand . As he reached the cash register , he vanished . " I 'm talkiri " to you , kid . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tied a string to my jaw . " Your mom know you 're here ? " I nodded , wondering who the old man had been , why he walked here , and made myself meet my uncle 's eyes . She loves you . The words started swelling inside me like bread dough . Do you know that ? That she loves you ? More than me . More than Dad , even . Little brother . " Easy , " the Rainmaker murmured. - Like I 'd spoken out loud . Uncle Kenny looked away- at the wall , with its pictures of bronc and bull riders , Warm Springs Indians on rough-coated Paints riding beside cowgirls with satin shirts , spangles , and silver-mounted tack in rodeo parades . " So when 's the show ? " He pushed his chair back , talking to the Rainmaker like he 'd forgotten I was there . " When do we get our rain ? " He was talking loud and everybody in the place was listening to him . " Hey , we 're spending the money . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 'll probably rain tonight . " The Rainmaker leaned back a little as the waitress plunked the big oval platter with his steak and eggs down in front of him , set down the smaller plate piled with toast , and whipped the coffee pot over his cup . She did n't fill mine , gave me a dirty look like I was drinking whiskey and not coffee as she paraded away . " You do n't sound too sure . " Uncle winked around the restaurant , got chuckles and skeptical grunts on cue . " No . " The Rainmaker cut a precise rectangle of steak . " Nothing is certain in real life . " He placed the meat neatly in his mouth . Uncle Kenny snorted and turned his back . " I 'll come wait with you tonight . " He did n't look back as he strode across the restaurant . " You all are invited , too . " He gave the room one last grin that seemed to focus on every person there . Got a couple of hoots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate just west of the Highway Motel .. . north side of the highway . Look for my rig on the road . And bring your umbrellas . " Chuckling , he pushed through the door . I heard his car start up outside . The Rainmaker did n't seem to notice the stares as he ate his breakfast . They made me want to crawl under the table , but I sat up straight and turned my empty cup around and around , wishing the waitress would give me more coffee . Finally he was done and we got up to go . When the cashier told us he was $1.50 short , he looked up at her so sharp she flinched . " He never got his cinnamon roll , " he said , with a nod in my direction . He had noticed , and not said anything . I was n't sure if I was pissed or not . WE DROVE BACK out to the dry wash where we sat in the shade of a twisted juniper , watching its shadow creep across the ground . Waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock had blown away a long time ago . " You were going to tell me , " I said . " How to do it . " " I never said that . " The Rainmaker gave me a severe look . " It 's not something you can teach . So you have decided to stop being a part of the human race ? " " You 're human . " I tossed a pebble at a fence lizard basking under a clump of bittergrass , watched it scuttle indignantly away . I tossed another when he did n't say anything . I kept remembering the way people had looked at him in the restaurant . " It 's just because you 're a stranger in town . " The words did n't sound very convincing . " You better tell your mother where you are . " He crossed his arms on his knees . " She 's worrying . " I got up , dusting off my jeans .

The light sort of covers them up instead . This one sat on the shelf of rock where the flowers had been . The Rainmaker noticed him , too . He looked at me and raised one eyebrow , but I turned my back on him and ran up the side of the wash , and all the way home , so that I came into the kitchen soaked with sweat . Mom met me with her fists on her hips , face stiff with anger , as if I 'd skipped my chores . " Kenny told me where you were . " Her voice trembled . " You go straight to your room , young man . " " Why ? " I blurted out the word , angry myself , now . " What 's wrong with having breakfast with ... " I could n't remember his name . " With the Rainmaker , " I finished lamely . " He 's a fraud . " She got angrier . " Where are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's a crook . Cheating people . " " Who has he cheated , huh ? You tell me who . " " Kenny said ... " " You always believe Uncle Kenny . " I was yelling now . " Uncle Kenny is so damn perfect . You wo n't believe me , but anything he says ... " She slapped me . For a moment I stared at her , face burning where her palm had struck , the sudden silence ringing in my ears . Then I turned and ran out of the kitchen , pounding up the stairs to my room . I slammed the door , and threw myself down on the bed . Mad at her . Mad at myself . Because a part of me had wanted her to tell me for sure that he was a fraud . I lay on the bed , waiting for her to come upstairs , watching the sun move across the cloudless sky and sweating in the still heat of the upstairs . What if it did n't rain ? I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did n't want to know . But she did n't come upstairs , and that hurt , too . And I guess I fell asleep after a while , because it was dark when I woke up , and Mom was setting a tray on my desk . " I brought your dinner up . " She turned on the light and straightened , pushing wisps of hair back from her forehead . " It must be ninety up here . Why did n't you turn on the fan ? " She snapped on the old box fan , her fingers brisk and impatient on the switch . The sudden gust of air felt cool on my face , and I imagined for a second that I could smell rain , the way the animals can . " Your uncle went down to where that ... man is camped . " Mom sounded uneasy . " He 's worried that a lot of people might show up . That they might get ... rowdy , " " They 'll come because he told " em to . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rainmaker . Because he wants them to . " " No . " " Do n't you get it , Mom ? " I leaned forward , but she would n't look at me . " People always do what he wants " em to do . " " Do n't talk about your uncle like that . " But she said it mechanically , in a dull tone without anger . " We could n't make it without him . I could n't make it . " She got to her feet and walked out of the room . I went over to the window , a fist squeezing my stomach until I thought I 'd be sick . To the west - in the direction of the distant ocean the stars ended in a band of pure darkness above the horizon . I felt the fist in my stomach loosen a hair , fixed my eyes on a small pair of dim stars . They vanished . A twinkling yellow star above them vanished a moment later . " Mom , " I called out . " Clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window . I heard her swallow . " Let 's go down there , " she said softly . " Your dad was going to haul the heifers to auction tomorrow . " We went downstairs together , tiptoeing through the living room , where my dad snored on the sofa , one hand loosely curled around a can of beer . I had never heard him snore before . His face looked soft and flushed . " Dad ? " I stopped . " He 's all right . " Mom 's face was as still as a winter pond.before a flight of geese lands . " He 's just drunk . " Her voice was without inflection . I had never seen my father drunk . But I remembered his uncertain tread on the stairs every night , and her tone as she coaxed him to bed . I thought Mom would take the truck , but she walked into the sage , as sure in the faint moonlight as if she came this way every day . I stumbled after her , tripping over sage stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her until she had reached the lip of the wash . The Rainmaker 's camp was visible in the light from a single propane lantern . At least a dozen men milled in a loose circle around him . I recognized Uncle Kenny . He was n't in his uniform . Suddenly he stepped forward , one hand closing on the front of the Rainmaker 's shirt , lifting him onto his toes . " You think we 're a bunch of dumb cowboys , do n't you ? " His voice came to me on the wind , edged with violence . " We 'll just grin and shuffle our feet and hand over our money to you , " cause you 're so smart , and we 're just dumb hicks . " The men around them growled and shuffled forward , as if they were puppets , and he 'd yanked all their strings at once . I took a step forward , caught my toe in a sage stem , and fell flat on my face . Eyes full of grit , I struggled to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen could see it , like on a movie screen . My face was wet and I wiped it on my sleeve . Crying , I thought , as I staggered to my feet . I 'm not crying . " Kenny ! " Mom 's voice was shrill and strange , and down below , my uncle paused , his fist drawn back , his other hand clutching the Rainmaker 's shirt front . He looked up at her . More water hit my face . Cold water . I looked up and laughed . It was raining . The stars had vanished , and the rain came down all at once , like someone had upended a cosmic bucket . It pounded on the dry ground and made the sage shiver . Below , the bunched , angry men were milling like nervous cattle . Uncle Kenny still held the Rainmaker by the shirt , but he had lowered his hand . My mom was running down to him , her wet hair plastered to her head . She looked like a kid and I realized suddenly how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somebody pounded on the Rainmaker 's back . By the time I got down to the Rainmaker 's camp , I was soaked to the skin and muddy . People were still hanging around . I knew who they were . All of them . They were watching the first streams of brown water run down the bottom of the wash . I looked up at the rock shelf where I found the flowers , and yeah , the ghost was there , standing on the very edge . And it was really dark , but I could see him better than I ever had before- like there was a spotlight shining on him . Julio Rojas . He looked sad . I looked at my mom , and she was staring at that rock , too , but she did n't see him . She had her hands pressed tight against her chest , like she hurt inside . And Uncle Kenny was looking at her , too . Water was starting to fill the wash , brown and foamy as chocolate , pouring down into the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julio had gone from his rock , and I thought about the flowers , and my mom running down through the sage like she knew the way . And I could feel the water , like I 'd felt the rain . I guess it was rain only on the ground now , and not in the sky . And if it ran down the east side of the draw , it would cut away a lot of the dirt beneath the rock shelf . I took a step away from everyone , staring at that chocolate flood , feeling it like it was a wet rope sliding through my hands , and I did n't really think about it , I just started to pull . A thin stream welled over a low berm of silt and stones from last winter 's floods , pushed a small rock out of the way . I was sweating . The rock tumbled down the slope and more water welled after it , pushing more stones out of the way , dissolving the dirt . Then , suddenly , the berm gave way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flood divided , sweeping now along the steep east wall of the wash , eating away the dirt below the shelf . Uncle Kenny stepped up beside me , not noticing me , his eyes on that dissolving bank . His shoulders were hunched and his hands clenched into fists . The rock shelf tilted and wavered , and I heard him take a fast , short breath . It tilted some more , slid very slowly into the churning water , smashing flat the sparse willow stems that lined the sides . Something showed in the hole left in the bank . Something not dirt colored . " Look ! " I pointed . " Over there , along the bank . " I guess a couple of people looked , because someone broke away from the crowd and walked along the lip of the wash , hat pulled down against the still-steady rain , water soaking his shirt and jeans . Mr. Walker . Owner of the Bar Double D. He stopped above the light-colored object and stepped quickly back . " It 's a body , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was buried here . " Everybody went running over , boots splashing through the water , a half dozen tall shapes in wet clothes and pulled down hats . My uncle did n't go . Neither did my mom . They were both looking at me . " It 's Julio , " I said . My mom 's face did n't change , but she made a small sound , like a hurt animal . " I was sleeping over the night he disappeared . " My uncle spoke up in that slow , lazy drawl he uses when he breaks up a fight . " Remember , Sandy ? " He turned to her , smiling a little , his hand on her shoulder . " Dave and I got to drinking , and I slept on the sofa . After we put Dave to bed . " I could feel his words turning solid in the air , reaching back over the weeks to change yesterday . I could feel my mom 's relief as she started to nod . " No , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I had sneaked out , because the moon was full , and I could n't sleep . " Donny ... " Mom whispered . " Do n't . " Uncle Kenny had saved me when the flood caught my pony . He helped us a lot . When Dad was drunk . We could n't make it without him . I could n't make it . I heard my Mother 's voice . Words took shape in my throat , stuck there like fish bones : Oh yeah , I remember now . You slept over . Sorry , Uncle Kenny . The Rainmaker was looking at me , and he looked sad . Julio had taught me how to chord on his old , battered guitar . He had laughed , and missed the girl he had loved . Up on the bank , two of the ranchers were bending over Julio Rojas 's body . I could n't look at Mom . " I saw you , " I said to my uncle . " I was up in the sage . " For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges , as if the flesh had eroded away , leaving nothing but bone . " You 're dreaming , kid . I was in the house , asleep , when he took off . Ask your mom . " His laugh sounded like something breaking . " You 're the crazy kid who sees ghosts and talks to the damn desert . Who 's gon na believe you ? " She had told him . I could n't look at her , wondering who else he had told , chuckling about it over a beer maybe , in the Spur at night . The rain was running into my eyes , but I did n't try to wipe my face , just stood there waiting for her to agree with him . Because I was only a crazy kid who saw ghosts , and back home , Dad had passed out , and there were the cattle to deal with . The ranch . " He 's not crazy , Ken . " Mom spoke softly . " And he 's right . " Her voice sounded empty and cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a hard time getting Dave up the stairs by myself that night . " For a long moment , my uncle and my mom stared at each other . Then my uncle turned away and slogged back toward the road . Only the Rainmaker saw him go . He was looking at me , standing hatless in the rain , his face as round and calm as the moon . " Donny ? " My mother 's voice trembled . " Julio used to play his guitar for me . " She closed her eyes briefly as we heard Uncle Kenny 's car start . " He was so young and full of hope . He was a poet - he made those songs up himself . That 's all that happened between us . I swear it . " I nodded , but I could n't speak . There was n't anything inside of me . Just night and rain . After a moment Mom turned away . I watched her trudge toward the road after Uncle Kenny . You could n't cross the wash anymore . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty house where my dad snored on the sofa . I flinched as the Rainmaker put a hand on my shoulder . " I have to , " I said . " Do n't I ? " He squeezed my shoulder . " I 'll make you some tea , " he said , and his voice sounded as old as the desert . Sad . Two of the ranchers went running back to their parked cars . To find the Sheriff ? I wondered . " No , thank you , " I said politely . " Mom 's waiting for me . " And she was - up on the road - hugging herself in the pouring rain . She straightened as I got close . " Are you going to go with him ? " she asked softly . I shook my head . " I used to.listen to Julio play , too , " I said . " He was really good . We 'll have to tell someone . " She nodded once , eyes closed , then opened them and smiled at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and as we walked along the road to our driveway together , the rain began to diminish to a slow , steady shower .
