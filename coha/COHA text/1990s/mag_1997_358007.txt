She dances with the single-minded intensity of the divine . On her head she balances a solid granite boulder , symbol of her mortal burdens . Round and round in syncopated steps , her open palms fluttering up and down in tireless supplication , she strives toward ecstasy . On and on she circles to the soft crooning of " Mariam , Mariam , Mariam , " bending and rising in private communion ; the heavy stone never wavers . Suddenly she halts and smiles with such sweetness that the Virgin must surely have answered her prayer . <P> This is the faith that moves mountains . At Christmastime in Axum , ancient home of the Queen of Sheba , reputed sanctuary of the Ark of the Covenant and heart of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church , such devotion is commonplace . Nothing has ever succeeded in crushing the simple rituals of piety that have been practiced here since the 4th century  --  not the communist ideology that ruled Ethiopia for much of the past two decades , not the cynicism of the modern age , not the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Once a year or once in a lifetime , on the Feast of the Virgin by the Julian calendar ( Nov. 29 this year ) , pilgrims flock by the tens of thousands to the Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion , the holiest of holy churches in their faith . The continual chants of " Mariam , Mariam , Mariam " bear witness to the high esteem , higher even than that accorded Jesus , in which Ethiopia 's Christians hold the Mother of the Saviour . One woman says this is the day Mary was miraculously transported to Axum . Another says no , this is the day Mary stopped here on her flight into Egypt ( a long detour , indeed ) . It does n't really matter ; the pilgrims believe she is here now . <P> Few Westerners know this kind of faith  --  idiosyncratic individual devotion at its most physical . There are no glittering ceremonies or grand processions , no public professions , no dramatic visions , only 10,000 acts of private veneration , prayer , supplication . What the stranger sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spiritual , and the awesome testament of comfort received , etched on their faces . <P> Ethiopian Orthodoxy is a curious amalgam of Judaic and Christian practices , African and European rituals . It is manifestly a man 's religion : only males may enter the inner sanctuary where it is claimed Moses ' Ark is hidden . No one knows anyone who has actually seen it , but the pilgrims are certain it is there . " They do n't have to let people see it for us to believe it , " says a gnarled elder . " That 's the mystery . " Women , he adds , are excluded because " God made the rules for mankind and women broke them . " <P> Still , women come to Axum to speak directly to Mary . They dance to beg for help . They approach the gateway to the inner shrine to genuflect and kiss its stones . They stand in lines along the outer walls offering silent prayers . " If we have a problem  --  lack of rain , poor harvests , infertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will listen , " says a young supplicant , " more than Jesus or God . If we are here , by our presence , she knows it even though we ca n't be in the church . "
