<p> The moments seemed an eternity to him until finally his desire overcame his apprehension , as I assured him it would , and he pulled the trigger of the loaded shotgun for the first time . More than 30 years before that latesummer afternoon in 1985 1 had those same emotions . Like my father , I waited patiently for my 14-year-old son , Steve , to reconcile his feelings . Afterward we walked over to the large , homemade cardboard target . Our earlier discussion of shot patterns and firearm safety made him anxious to see the spread of holes left by the pellets from his first shot . <p> Steve completed the hunter education course offered by DEC through its network of volunteer instructors . I took the course with him to improve my ability for reinforcing what he learned in the classroom . The 10-hour course turned out to be an enjoyable refresher for me . And it led to some valuable discussions on our way home from the evening classes and during the hunts after he got a small game hunting license . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of young hunters . It entails a special closeness in guiding Youngsters on firearms safety and respect for the environment . Seeing the development of their self-sufficiency and self-confidence is very rewarding . What better reason for getting involved in helping your youngsters , or those of a friend , in their education ? <p> Rural areas of New York have always allowed young people the chance to experience hunting at an early age . Through mandatory accompaniment by an older licensed hunter , many youngsters have gained a life-long interest in hunting . But , suburban growth during the last 40 years has changed the opportunity for young people to participate in hunting . A wealth of other activities such as athletics , school music programs and a variety of youth organizations have competed for their time and attention . During those years , a generation matured with little or no occasion to experience hunting . Now , as adults they are unable to provide the kind of direction on hunting that still occurs in rural areas . instead of the father as the teacher , today it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some friend of the family . However , such help is often absent , leaving young people with no chance to fulfill the desire for a hunting license . <p> Currently many youngsters are guided by mentoring from adult hunters . Those mentors help young hunters develop important skills such as how to identify wildlife species , look for signs of wildlife activity , and recognize species habitat . These young people see first-hand the value of wildlife habitats in ecological communities . From such understanding often comes serious commitment to fish and wildlife resource stewardship . <p> To aid families needing help , sportsmen prompted a trial Apprentice Hunter Program starting in southeastern New York in 1991 . The program is examining the value of special efforts to fulfill the social support needed by young people . ( See box ) <p> Sportsmen continue to provide major financial support for New York fish and wildlife management through the purchase of sporting licenses . Young sportsmen are among the future stewards upon whom New York 's fish and wildlife resource is dependent . They are the mainstay of an outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the management that sustains everyone 's opportunity to use and enjoy fish and wildlife . <p> In 1925 the Conservation Fund was created under the New York State Finance Law , designating that revenue from the sale of sporting licenses be spent for fish and game purposes . Since then several hundred million dollars in license revenue have gone to the fund for fish and wildlife stewardship . <p> Sportsmen also urged adoption of a federal excise tax on the sale of firearms and ammunition to fund wildlife restoration . Distribution of those monies to each of the states is in accordance with the 1937 Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act , also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act . An excise tax on fishing equipment funds sport fish restoration via the 1950 Dingell-Johnson Act ( Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act ) , augmented in 1984 by the Wallop-Breaux Act . Federal aid represents nearly 15 percent of DEC 's division of fish and wildlife program funding . For 1990-91 New York 's federal aid apportionment was nearly $7 million . <p> DEC 's Sportsman Education Program is heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $653,000 supplemented by $150,000 from the Conservation Fund . That year the program 's 3,400 volunteer instructors conducted more than 1,800 classes to train and certify more than 42,000 new hunters . <p> Sportsmen prompted New York State legislation which required , starting in 1949 , that all 14- and 15-year-olds be trained in firearms safety to qualify for their first hunting license . Since that first-in-the-nation requirement , New York has maintained one of the best hunter education courses . <p> The course teaches students how to handle firearms safely , along with respect for other people and the law . Ethical behavior is also stressed to ensure recognition of game species , responsible use of all game taken and landowner permission to hunt on private lands . Learning respect for firearms enables students to influence their peers and discourage unsafe firearm handling and help prevent accidents . <p> During the last 15 years the annual number of people taking the basic firearms hunter education course has declined from more than 50,000 students to about 27,000 in 1990 . Much of that reduction has been in the number of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3,000 . Additional youngsters take the course at DEC 's conservation camps each summer where over one-third of the campers participate . In 1991 there were 439 campers who completed the course - 343 boys and 96 girls . <p> Recently , hunting opportunities increased substantially for young people under age 16 . Legislation , in 1991 , created a Junior Hunting License for youth ages 12-15 based on a joint proposal of the New York State Conservation Council and the New York State Conservation Fund Advisory Council . Previously , New York was the lasta remaining state not permitting 12- and 13-year-olds to hunt . In other states where hunter education is mandatory , 12-year-olds have demonstrated their ability to hunt safely and responsibly . <p> The Junior Hunting License is akin to a learner 's permit and may be used only to hunt small game . A junior hunter is an apprentice who participates only with family involvement . <p> To qualify for a Junior Hunting License , each young person must successfully complete the hunter education course . The license is issued only when the young person is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuance by signing across the face of the license . Small game hunting is then allowed only when 12- and 13-year-olds are accompanied by a parent , legal guardian , or relative over age 21 designated in writing by a parent , who holds a small game hunting or sportsman license . For 14- and 15-year-olds to hunt , each must be accompanied by a parent , or a person over age 18 designated in writing by a parent or legal guardian , who holds a small game hunting or sportsman license . <p> An apprenticeship of up to four years may seem excessive to some people , but it is considered prudent . During that time social support for the youngsters is assured through required parental involvement and responsible supervision . <p> Interest in the Junior Hunting License appears to be good during its first year . Preliminary indications , based on initial reporting of license sales , are that well over 16,000 Junior Hunting Licenses will be issued . The number of 12- and 13-year-olds obtaining the license may be nearly 7,000 . Interest in the squirrel hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license issuance to those students who become certified before the end of the license year . <p> Among the 12- and 13-year olds who received a 1991-92 junior Hunting License there was only one accident . A self-inflicted foot injury resulted when a 13-year-old boy was hunting alone . Not only did the accident occur in the absence of adult supervision , it happened 22 days before the license became valid . <p> During last fall 's small game hunting seasons there were no accidents involving junior hunters age 12 or 13 . Those several thousand young people hunted responsibly and safely . Their families and other involved individuals are commended for the help and supervision they provided . Responsibility for apprenticeship continues until young hunters reach age 16 and may obtain a regular small game hunting , big game hunting or sportsman license . An additional two years of accompaniment by an experienced licensed big game hunter is required to hunt big game . <p> New York State sportsmen have demonstrated their commitment to the stewardship of the fish and wildlife resource through an unparalleled financial contribution .

A former leader of the big game limit in the bureau of wildlife , he directed New York 's successful pioneering effort to foster black bear cubs in the wild . <p> APPRENTICE HUNTER PROGRAM <p> In 1977 , the bureau of wildlife asked Cornell University to study hunting participation factors . We learned that many people hunt consistently from year to year , some only occasionally . After taking the hunter education course , some people never start hunting and others quickly drop out . Later studies show that an apprenticeship experience and support from family , friends and other people are important factors in starting and continuing the hunting experience . <p> Often young people interested in hunting lack an adult companion and teacher . Companionship adds value to hunting . Youngsters also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and skills . The New York State Conservation Council , other organizations like the New York Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation , Cornell and sportsmen at large offered to help . Together we developed an Apprentice Hunter Program . <p> Hands-on training and social support are arranged for apprentices aged 12 to 17 . Experienced volunteer sportsmen are trained as master hunters or mentors . Youngsters , parents and master hunters plan at least 15 activities for a year-long apprenticeship . Practicing safe firearms handling , target shooting , wildlife photography , a game dinner or an event at a sportsmen 's club are typical activities . <p> We are testing the program in the Hudson Valley , and plan to expand into central-western New York in 1992 . A successful statewide program could benefit 2,100 or more youth each year . <p> For more information contact Apprentice Hunter Program Project Leaders : TABLE <p> Illustration : Man with child shooting gun . <p>
