<p> WHAT 'S WRONG WITH MEN ? <p> Editor  --  Women of America wake up ! Are n't you tired of being a second-class citizen ? It 's obvious our men do n't respect us . They are the majority in power but they take absolutely no responsibility . <p> If a mother on welfare has another child , no extra money says male Governor Wilson . But what I want to know is did she get pregnant alone ? Why does n't the man have to support her child ? Where does he disappear to ? I suggest if a man impregnates a welfare mother he should be given a vasectomy . <p> The Catholic country of Italy voted and won legal abortion , but our men here in America would rather risk their women 's lives getting abortion in back alleys , losing their lives or being maimed . Of course you realize women with money have never had this problem . They fly off to other countries and receive a good clean , safe abortion . So  --  what happens to the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion illegal we know that wo n't put an end to abortions . And now what has come on the market ? Condoms for women ! We now have to protect ourselves from AIDS because again our men wo n't take responsibility . What in the world is wrong with the American male ? It 's time we women stand up and be heard ! <p> DEE VANN <p> Pacifica <p> . <p> FAT CATS <p> Editor  --  The letter " Tax Refugees " ( Chronicle , February 12 ) has that appealing populist ring with its picture of rampaging , out-of-control government politicians rocking the hard-pressed middle class with more and more taxes and spending . <p> It is the Libertarian message . It is slick and it is phony . Nobody loves it more than the fat-cat corporations which have wallowed in special tax treatment during the Reagan-Bush years . The Libertarian demagoguery simply ignores this increasing polarization , the fact that the top money- making corporations now pay an average of only 5 percent in taxes , and that they have used their tax windfall not for reinvesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in an orgy of greedy takeovers and leveraged buyouts , intoning " Get government off our backs " all the way to the bank . ( Of course there are also corporations and businesses with some sense of responsibility . ) <p> Americans are mostly realistic folk who will respond positively to honest leadership and example . They may never love taxes , but they would be willing to carry their share of the load if they knew that taxes were fairly applied across the board , with no windfalls and loopholes for the favored fat cats . <p> LES RODNEY <p> Walnut Creek <p> . <p> GRAND ACCORD <p> Editor  --  Although the odds are getting longer , those of us who were involved in developing the reforms of timber harvest practices embodied in the " Grand Accord " are still hopeful of its passage . California Trout believes that proposed legislation offers significant reforms that provide increased protection for the environment . While it may not completely fulfill everyone 's objectives , it is a marked improvement over current law , and it will benefit both the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Accord has received broad support from environmental groups including the Planning and Conservation League , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Audubon Society and California Trout . It is supported by timber companies representing over 75 percent of the California timber industry , plus many small landowners . It is also supported by The Chronicle . <p> The Grand Accord now deserves the support of the Legislature , which should act in California 's best interests and send it to the governor to become law . <p> JAMES HAMILTON <p> Conservation Director <p> California Trout <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WATER SOLUTION <p> Editor  --  I arrived in California in 1940 . I can not remember a time that there was not a controversy about the water supply . There has been a scarcity of water or too much water . The last few years there has been a scarcity of water . <p> There is a solution , a permanent solution . Along the coast build 20 , 30 , 40 ( let the experts decide how many ) desalinization plants . Use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be used for all other purposes . <p> Imagine what this will do to the economy of California . We can grow anything all year . All the arid land not in use now can be cultivated . Thousands of people will be put to work on the desalinization plants , on the water distribution system and for agriculture . If the project started today , it can be a reality by the year 2000 . This will make California the richest state in the world . <p> Everyone with any sense will be happy to invest in these desalinization plants . It is a great opportunity to make a lot of money on your investment . It can not fail . All banks , insurance firms , businesses and people will see this wonderful opportunity for investment and grab it . <p> FRANK LINDSAY <p> San Jose <p> . <p> NUCLEAR ARMS BAN <p> Editor  --  Congratulations to Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus on agreeing to destroy their nuclear weapons ! Now if only some of the less enlightened nations such as the United States , Russia , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international treaty banning all nuclear weapons . <p> C. ZADIK SHAPIRO <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> RECOGNIZE CROATIA <p> Editor  --  I do n't understand why the U.S. government does not recognize Croatia . Why does our country , which is supposed to stand for freedom and independence , sit by while the Yugoslav Army kills thousands and destroys a country ? <p> By recognizing Croatia , we would be helping another group of repressed people gain their independence , and get the help they need to rebuild all the destruction . I wonder , if Croatia had the oil and lobby money that Kuwait does , would our policy towards them be the same ? <p> CHARLES R. ACKERSON <p> Venice <p> . <p> HELP FOR S.F. SCHOOLS <p> Editor  --  I would like to thank those who voted yes on Proposition A. This proposition will give us , students , the opportunity to keep our extra-curricular activities . Even though this proposition raises the sales tax on everything you buy ( gee , I 'm really making you feel better , are n't I ? ) , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco . Once again , thank you for your much needed support . <p> ANNE MARIE ARGUELLES <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' REASONABLE FORCE ' <p> Editor  --  I 'm frightened by the continuing outrage at the jury verdict awarding money to the convicted felon whose leg was broken by a cabbie during a citizen 's arrest . <p> Those who are outraged appear to suggest that a person making an arrest should be able to use any force whatsoever , and that regardless of the amount of force used , a criminal should not be entitled to collect money if someone violates his rights . <p> Our law , however , says that a person  --  citizen or cop  --  may only use " reasonable " force when making an arrest . What is " reasonable " depends on the specific facts of each case . The law further provides that even a convicted criminal may sue if any person uses unreasonable force . In short , neither peace officers or private citizens have an unrestricted license to use any force necessary to catch crooks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . Given these rules of law , and the facts as reported , the jury 's verdict is not patently unreasonable . <p> If the reasoning of those outraged at the jury verdict were followed , incidents such as last year 's Los Angeles police attack on Rodney King would have to be excused . After all , the police in that case were simply using force during the arrest of a fleeing criminal . By this same reasoning , no police brutality case could ever be sustained . <p> Those who so exuberantly attack the jury verdict should carefully consider whether they want to live in a society where police or private citizens are allowed to use any force necessary when making an arrest . I would advise those who would grant such power to the police or private citizens to practice well their straight- arm salute and goose-step , as those skills would no doubt prove useful in the world they would make for themselves . <p> STEVEN FAMA <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HUMBLE GIANT <p> Editor  --  Alex Haley educated a complacent and polarized nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this is a " kinder , gentler world , " it is in no small part due to this humble giant of American letters . <p> DENNIS A.
