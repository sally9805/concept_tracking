That criminal investigations are a nuisance is a self-evident truth , really , to my way of thinking far more self-evident than the truth that all men are created equal . At least that 's what I 'm trying to explain to my friends Deirdre and Emily , and to myself as well , although there 's not much controversy over the point . The difficulty is that we 're all rather drunk and I 'm having the most troublesome time with my consonants . This amuses Deirdre no end , and Emily , too , and even I laugh a bit once I 've managed to disentangle my tongue from what I 'm trying to say . Emily lights a cigarette . Deirdre refills my glass . She pays no attention to what I 've been drinking or to whether I 've finished yet . " Campari mixes well with everything , Gloria . " I 'm prepared to believe her , although it 's well known how much she exaggerates . As the token brunette among us , Deirdre 's always trying too hard to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed than I , takes control of the conversation . She 's off briefly on a tangent about trust-fund managers , and then returns to ask , with her farm-girl smile , whether I 'm still screwing the Russian . I remind her that she asked me the same question last week , that she asks me about my publisher at Portfolio every time we 're drunk together , and the answer is always the same . " And what 's that ? " " Whenever necessary , and never for recreational purposes . " My eyes wander as I say this . I survey the living room for remnants of my cocktail party : glasses everywhere and of every kind imaginable , some I 'm certain I do n't own . Bits of outerwear remain , too , scarves andthe occasional glove left by a drunken guest . People freeze to death in San Francisco in December . The room returns to focus some seconds later when Deirdre says , " Fucking Dmitri for the good of magazine journalism ? How selfless of you . PJ must have trained you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyebrows artfully raised above the wire rims of her glasses . Even in my own apartment , Deirdre looks somehow foreign , as if she just stepped out of an Armani ad . People who have n't met her always expect her to speak with an accent . When she does n't , the temptation is to compliment her on her English . " Speaking of PJ , is n't it awfully soon to be throwing a party ? I mean you are a suspect and all . " " I ca n't stop the planet because of it . " I shrug . " Given the direction of things , I doubt I 'd have invited him anyway . " Of course , Deirdre 's too romantic to understand , and besides , she 's busy flipping through my magazines . What she 's looking for is me . " Page fifty-two , " I offer , to save her the trouble of going through Time cover-to-cover and myself the trauma of having to wait while she does . " They used one of the Klugman photos . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I Rather Like the Attention . " ' " She reads the caption aloud . This week the FBI has n't found any evidence for or against me , so I 've moved from the news to the entertainment section . " Lemme see . " Emily grabs the magazine away from Deirdre , who glowers at her until she lays it flat on the couch beside me . " You look fat , " Em says triumphantly , filling her cheeks with air . " You should sue . " " She ca n't , " interjects Deirdre . " She a public figure now . They can make her look as fat as they want . " I clear my throat . " I do not look fat , guys . " Generally speaking , I 'm extraordinarily beautiful , if I do say so myself , at twenty-seven free of wrinkles and other common imperfections . But when the lighting is flat , my face looks bloated rather than round , and my nose all but disappears . A little makeup fixes everything . " Yesterday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emily and Deirdre just stare at me . Saying nothing . " He was being obtuse , " I explain . " Does anybody know the way to the bathroom ? " " We 're in your apartment . " " Of course . " And then I remember that I 've had to pee all night and have n't because it 's too much trouble to walk to the bathroom in this state . And I ca n't face the mirrors everywhere , which never let me lose sight of myselfjust when I 've managed to escape all the newspapers and magazines and crisscrossed TV signals . That 's the merit of alcohol and why the famous always have drinks in their hands at parties . " Somebody pour me more . Please . " A new drink finds its way to my hands , this one light and icy . I hold it up . " To our deaths ! " " To our deaths ! " they repeat in unison . We drink and Deirdre asks Emily about the ad campaign she 's working on . Vici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of their best , apparently , or so she 's told us . Vici is her latest coup , accomplished by offering athletes big endorsement money without company permission . She 's never worn sneakers a day in her life , does n't ever plan to , either , and now she 's got all these new shoes she 's perpetually trying to pawn off on others . She 's already given me three pairs , one for tennis , one for running , and one for pentathlons , whatever those are . I 've in turn tried to give them to people at the office , but of course they all have different shoe sizes and most of them exercise as little as I do . People always mistake me for a tennis player and a swimmer and a skier . The last time I was in Aspen was when I was seventeen and with Daddy . The last time I was in a pool was when I was twelve . I 've never played tennis . " Product sell-through . . . brand imaging . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Deirdre 's in human resources and never has anything interesting to say . They 've lit cigarettes . I 've got one , too . As far as I recall , I do n't smoke . My glass is sticky and my mouth tastes of peppermint . I try to ask a question , to find the conversation , but lose my place before words reach my tongue . Deirdre is sorting through the clothing left behind , pocketing a scarf that appeals to her and offering another to Emily . Emily shakes her head . " You should n't steal , Deir . You might get Gloria in trouble . "
