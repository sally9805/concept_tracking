THE OTHER GLOVE FINALLY dropped . Last week representatives of Michael Jackson and the 14-year-old boy who accused him of sexual molestation agreed to settle the boy 's civil suit . No promises were put in writing  --  and no judge would tolerate such promises  --  but it was understood that the boy will not testify in pending criminal investigations of Jackson being pursued by the Los Angeles and Santa Barbara district attorneys . Meanwhile , the star gets to maintain his innocence . The price tag was estimated between $15 million and $50 million  --  part paid in cash , part to be fed into a trust fund for the boy . <P> Afterward , the two parties sounded as if they were the same side . Both professed to be pleased with the resolution ; both blamed the media for snooping ; both underlined that Jackson proclaims himself blameless ; both implied that they settled to protect their sensitive clients . " A child ca n't heal until this is behind him , " declared the boy 's attorney , Larry Feldman , and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get on with his life , " said his lawyer , Johnnie Cochran , " and let the healing process begin . " <P> For Michael that may take a while . His bodyguards , for example , are pressing their own suit against him , and court cases await over the cancellation of his tour . And Los Angeles D.A . Gil Garcetti insisted that his office has not closed the Jackson file . But California law does not allow the state to compel testimony from juveniles in sex-crime cases . Without the boy 's evidence , the authorities may have only hearsay testimony  --  probably not enough to win or even bring a case against Jackson . So for now his freedom is assured , if not his reputation . Neither he nor the boy will be required to relate bedtime intimacies under oath . <P> The agreement capped five months of tawdry wrangling in what now seems like the all-tabloid media . Maids and chauffeurs , lissome lads and their parents fed their accusations of misconduct or declarations of support to the avid press . Tracking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littered the lawn of the Superior Court building in Santa Monica last week to hear the announcement of the epochal compromise  --  and for the two squads of lawyers . The main attorneys got high marks for their work . " Feldman publicized , publicized , publicized , and then got the big settlement , " says New York City attorney Raoul Felder . " Cochran and Howard Weitzman did a good job by hobbling the criminal case . " <P> Last August , at the beginning of the case , both sides were in disarray . The boy 's first attorney , Gloria Allred , famous for trying cases in the media , did n't last long . For a while , Jackson 's improbable front man was private detective Anthony Pellicano . As for Jackson 's lawyers , one of them never met his client ; the other spent only 30 minutes with him in Moscow and promptly departed for the South of France . They did not even know if Garcetti was issuing an arrest warrant for Jackson . The savviest legal and personal adviser was actress Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only man for the job .
