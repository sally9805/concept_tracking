IT IS MORE THAN I60 miles from the nearest coastline . It is a city from which you can drive for 30 minutes in any direction and be in barren countryside . It is also a place with a group of courses that can cause even the most seasoned golf vacationer to sit up and take notice . A round of applause , please , as we welcome San Antonio to the brotherhood of big-time American golf destinations . Surprised ? You should n't be , as the home of The Alamo and the Admiral ( the Spurs ' David Robinson ) has the rare mixture of a super climate , thriving tourist attractions , and enough land to accommodate both newer daily-fee courses and hearty municipal tracks . Although a fast-growing city that is now the nation 's eighth-largest , San Antonio has retained its small-town feel while evolving from a heavy military and industrial center to a city that calls tourism its number-one money maker . You 'd be hard-pressed to find a livelier place to take a golf vacation . Unlike many other cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of business , thanks in part to the extraordinary success of the River Walk ( Paseo del Rio ) . This complex of restaurants , bars and shops set below street level on the banks of the San Antonio River offers the best nightlife in town and connects the lobbies of many downtown hotels . Slowmoving dinner barges and traveling mariachi bands complete the scene-picture Disney 's " It 's a Small World " ride with booze . And for golfers , it seems appropriate that the growth of the area should spread to the fairways . San Antonio has been making a big push since 1993 to get the word out to golfers , and it has begun to see the results . Spiced with old favorites and many new development , the area provides plenty of variety without being ostentatious . One of the most pleasing aspects of San Antonio golf is that it is truly San Antonio golf . Most of the top courses are within the city limits , and a network of highways makes travel relatively smooth . If your image of Texas is flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , you 're only half right . This region of Texas , from here to Austin and points west , is known as the Hill Country , and with just cause . Some parts of the area resemble southern New England , especially in autumn when the oak trees are dotted with color . There is no true standout course in San Antonio . That 's not a cop out , just the reality . Instead , there is a well-balanced group of six must-plays , and several more which are only a step behind . Hill Country Golf Club is a superb Arthur Hills design on the city 's western outskirts , while the adjacent Hyatt Regency Resort offers the best accommodations in town ( it 's a GOLF MAGAZINE Silver Medal Resort ) . Photograph Although the seventh hole at La Cant ra plays only 316 yards , it is easily the most memorable , and distracting , hole in San Antonio . // The 6,913-yard Hill Country track is a solid , understated test of golf that does n't pretend to be anything it is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio , it offers a huge challenge to the better player while also being eminently playable . Live oak trees and many species of native vegetation , including cactus , dominate the setting . The holes roll gently along the countryside , with no severe elevation changes but enough subtle variation to affect approach shots . The course rewards accuracy and patience . There are n't many birdie holes , but there are plenty that can jump up and bite you . For walkers , Hill Country is a pleasure . If you prefer to ride , however , the carts are equipped with a high-tech course guide and scoring system that does everything except play the shot for you . On the other side of the spectrum from Hill Country is La Cantera , the site of the PGA Tour 's Texas Open since 1995 . Located on the north side of town , this thrill-a-minute design by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish has made quite a bit of noise since its debut three years ago . It was a GOLF MAGAZINE " Top 10 You Can Play " pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 500-room Westin hotel scheduled to open by mid-1999 . The 7,001-yard layout is spread over three hilltops , serving up views of the surrounding terrain . Some holes seem like a game of " can-you-top-this , " with dramatic elevation changes , carries over ravines , and risk-reward opportunities . But La Cantera pulls this off without being gimmicky because it 's the roller-coaster property , not the design , that causes the drama . Photograph Arthur Hills left nothing in the bag at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort , skillfully using the surroundings to craft an exacting , subtle gem . // Speaking of roller coasters , the seventh hole provides one of the most remarkable scenes in all of golf . The tee shot on this 316-yard par four drops 80 feet down to the fairway , set in the bottom of an old limestone quarry . However , your eyes seem glued to what sits to the left of the hole : The Fiesta Texas Amusement Park , complete with " The Rattler , " a huge wooden roller coaster directly on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , your concentration is interrupted by the shrieks of yet another group of thrill seekers as they cascade down the coaster 's initial drop . La Cantera is also the home of its own Golf Academy , directed by Harvey Penick disciple Bryan Gathright . The academy sits at the opposite end of the massive driving range from the main clubhouse , creating a private instruction area . Several packages are available , including a one-day option with a full morning of instruction , lunch and an afternoon round on the golf course . Perhaps no other city can boast of a site less than ten minutes from downtown that would match that of The Quarry Golf Club , a Keith Foster design opened in 1993 that is one of the most unusual layouts anywhere . At 6,740 yards from the back tees , its moderate length may lull you into a false sense of security . Make no mistake about it , this is a very difficult golf course . The watery , treeless front nine lies between an adjacent expressway , railroad tracks and an office complex-not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esthetic touch with a propensity to swallow golf balls . An entirely different experience awaits as you descend into the quarry for the back nine . It 's one beastly hole after another , with forced carries over waste bunkers , narrow fairways , and 400 more yards of length . The setting , however is something to behold . The sheer walls of the quarry extend up to a rim lined with luxury homes , and the factory where limestone was once converted into concrete is now the upscale Quarry Market mall . It 's urban renewal , with a touch of The Flintstones ' Bedrock . Moving back to more classicly styled tests of golf , SilverHorn Golf Club sets a high standard . Walking down the fairways , the golfer sees live oak and mesquite trees , gently rolling holes and straightforward shot values . Photograph The 17th hole at The Quarry , dubbed " Reload , " is an apt slogan for a course whose rugged back nine has plenty of pitfalls. // SilverHorn can play up to 6,922 yards , but strategy is rewarded more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all but the longest hitters . While the 556-yard sixth is considered by many to be the signature hole , the 524-yard 18th , with a pond fronting the green , is the shortest par five and can make a $2 Nassau very intriguing . The architect , Randy Heckenkemper , is a former designer for Weiskopf and Morrish , and has earned a reputation for building low-key tracks that make maximum use of their surroundings . Although SilverHorn is inside a housing development , the dense vegetation makes for well-carved holes that appear very natural . The newest and most anonymous development in town is Canyon Springs , unveiled in late December on the northern city limits . The developers made an effort to keep things quiet until the grand opening ( maybe so they could have the place to themselves for the first few days of play ) . Now that the word is out , they 're unlikely to ever get that chance again . The 7,077-yard layout was designed by Thomas Walker . Do n't worry if you 've never heard of him ; if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of his name in the future . Canyon Springs is set in a scenic oak forest covering a series of hills . The isolated routing makes you feel as if you 're on top of a private mountain , as no two fairways run parallel . Some might expect a tricked-up course with wild elevation swings and long forced carries . Instead , the design blends in with its environment instead of taking advantage of it . Photograph SilverHorn Is a strategist 's delight where the natural surroundings dictate the challenge . // There were some heated discussions during construction on whether or not to leave some strategically placed trees , and in the end , the correct decisions were made . The result is a thinking person 's layout where placement off the tee is critical and the huge greens can make for wildly different pin positions . It needs some time to mature , but in the near future Canyon Springs is set to become one of the area 's finest . On the southeast side of town is the historic Pecan Valley Golf Club . Built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1968 PGA Championship , where Arnold Palmer came very close to winning the only major championship that has eluded him ( he finished one stroke behind Julius Boros ) . Four plaques , including one on the 18th hole in the spot where Palmer hit his second shot in that PGA , mark various historic spots . Thirty years later , the 7,071yard track has aged well and continues to provide a healthy challenge . The attractive holes are laid out over gently rolling terrain , with massive old oak trees wreaking havoc with even mildly off-line shots . Salado Creek comes into play on six holes , most notably the lOth and llth . Both are mediumlength par fours where a good drive is a must to avoid the creek . Pecan Valley is the least expensive of San Antonio 's premier courses , and has a welcome , laidback feel . The facilities are pleasantly modest , there 's a healthy core of walkers and the course 's condition looks very natural . It 's more like a top-shelf municipal track , which may explain why the USGA is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Public Links Championship , the most egalitarian of national championships . As stated before , San Antonio is an enjoyable destination partly because most of the good courses are conveniently located within the city itself . However , a trip to this part of Texas is not complete without seeing the countryside . Tapatio Springs Resort , located about 30 miles northwest of town in Boerne , is the place to go . This secluded layout presents an enjoyable resort test . It plays 6,515 yards from the back tees , but requires a few carries and has water in play on half the holes . The course is routed through a scenic valley , with expansive homes dotting the hillsides . At about 1,600 feet above sea level , the terrain is a bit more rugged and there are several great views of the property . With only 150 guest rooms and suites , Tapatio holds on to an intimate atmosphere . But with over 1,400 acres of land to play with , resort owner Jack Parker has big plans for the future . Land has already been cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting in the wings . Tapatio , with its remarkable setting and friendly staff , has carved a niche for itself as a low-stress getaway with a different flavor than the city courses . // Quick Facts // San Antonio 's municipal courses offer great bang for the buck . Before the $100 round , cart paths and " golf communities " became commonplace , these were the types of courses that entertained and challenged generations of players . Cedar Creek is the leader of the pack . At just under 7,200 yards from the tips , it 's a bear of a course that leads players on a wild ride over the most dramatic terrain in town ( which was donated to the city by private developers ) . The tight layout has stands of trees lurking at every dogleg . Errant drives can find themselves rolling off hillsides , disappearing into bushes and otherwise causing plenty of headaches . Cedar Creek 's conditioning is better than the other munis , and the green fees are higher , too . Try to get out on a weekday for a quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city , is a virtually treeless layout set on a hillside that is the best bargain in town at $17 . The rolling , windswept holes fan out in two directions and can play very differently from day to day . A friendly staff makes you feel at home , and it 's a great course to play towards the end of the day , as a wide westward expanse allows for glorious sunsets . Willow Springs completes the muni tour . The parkland layout dates back to 1923 and is the longest course in town at 17,221 yards , playing as tough as its more upscale competitors . It features an outstanding collection of par threes , including the uphill 230-yard 18th , one of the toughest in San Antonio . A Tex-Mex town with a big heart , San Antonio is a golf destination just waiting to explode . Additional resorts are the next step . As of now , the Hyatt Hill Country has the only stay-andplay packages in town , but that is sure to change . In the meantime , the downtown hotels offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and historic districts . Spring and fall are the best times to visit , and the city will be especially alive in late March when it hosts the 1998 NCAA Men 's Final Four at the Alamodome .
