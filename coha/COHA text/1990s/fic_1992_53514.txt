On the bus from Nashville to Lonoke , Arkansas , Jim Yankee Fish sits in back , in the star suite , with Bones , the bass player , while the star is up front doing business . The young and old singers all call Fish " Yank " when they see him in bars or on the road . Yank they whisper , and he knows it : feels it like a hard strum of a guitar on his chest , came from goddamned Boston , can you believe it ? Had a couple of songs with other artists and one killer of his own ; Fish feels it in the bright young eyes that look at him , saying , Give me your secret . Let me write one killer song , just to get me known . They want the secret to his beginning , but they do not want to know how to be what he is now , thirty-eight and obscure . They have their own plans for what they 'll be doing when they hit thirty-eight . <p> Now he is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest star of the Big John Casper show . Big John is a former Hee Haw star who has made his living since his star fell by renting out this and three other buses to major rock and country groups ( the last , <p> Fish understands , was the rock group Heart ; " they 're okay , " Big John told him earlier , " no ripped upholstery " ) and living off some hits from his early days , and , like Fish , occasionally doing a television show . Last night Big John appeared on Nashville Now , and the band today is tired , sleeping in their bunks . <p> Fish 's one monster hit was called " Wo n't You Walk the Line " and was a part of his hit album of the same name . The song became a country classic , though nobody else has recorded a version since Fish 's own in 1984 . He wishes somebody had : he could use the money . He looks out the window at the morning and the rushing red clay walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little older . He has the buses to rent , and a house in Hendersonville , where the stars live ; he never was any songwriter , but he 's got a good ear , and he 's done some songs that others wrote ( one by Fish ) that he 's managed to spin into hits . <p> Fish had six months of brilliance , and then a wife who was a nurse with a drug problem . Since their divorce , he has had an apartment in Nashville which he helps pay for with maintenance work , and a cat named Elvis that he leaves with his landlord when he is gone . <p> Still , at times like this , with the wheels singing beneath him , Fish feels better about his life . It is n't every " star " who will let you ride in their suite , listen to their $2,000 stereo , and watch videos on their big video screen . He likes being tight with Big John . He likes this brown-and-cream-colored vehicle : plush carpets , televisions , VCRs , stereos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he was once , a star who belonged in a suite like this . And Fish has the respect that comes with being a has-been  --  the respect that comes from having been there  --  he sees that more often now in his chosen Tennessee home : this wishing in the eyes of young singer-songwriters who would die to have a hit on the charts , and an album they could send home , to Iowa , or Kansas , or wherever it is they come in from for the American dream . <p> Bones lies on the bunk next to Fish , already sleeping with the seventy m.p.h. roll . Twenty-six years old and cowboy boots and jeans and jean shirt and heavy Indian metal bracelets on his wrists . He 's got some kind of nerve disease in the right arm that keeps crimping the right hand until one day , Bones has told him , the hand will not move . That does n't seem to bother Bones like a night without drinking would , or a gig without a fat paycheck to go blow would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make my money by then , Bones has said . Who needs a hand then ? If Bones had his druthers , he 'd play the Beatles and the Rolling Stones all day long . He has no medical insurance : he lives day to day , check to check . He chums around with Steely , the guitar player , the twenty-year-old who ran away from home and who , for some reason , chose Bones as his mentor and friend . Fish has seen them , these youngsters who come into town , looking like gods and playing like the wind and setting no future up for themselves . Bones and Steely chuckle over women at the all-night stops , punch jukeboxes . They believe the future is infinite and full of money ; they imagine pictures of themselves posed dramatically in music magazines , calls from all kinds of stars to do roadwork , publishers crazy about those songs they write on the road . They are polite , but they do n't get too close to Fish . <p> Bones sleeps with his head heavily in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are squeezing his nose . The bass guitarist moans at the metal sliding over his temples and turns his head away , toward the wall . Fish sets the glasses on the table , goes through the library of videotapes under the video machine . He chooses Crocodile Dundee , slides the cartridge into the slot . The television blinks at him ; comes alive . It says Paramount Pictures . Fish rubs his eyes , shoves a pillow behind him on his bunk . He remembers the old movies : the Columbia films that started out with a woman in a flowing gown on a pedestal , raising a torch to the sky as the music swelled around her , a glow behind her like a light from heaven . <p> " It 's okay , baby , " Marcia said to him in the dark . The Tennessee moon came through the window , making the tip of one breast , her shoulders , her face , glowing white . " It 's okay . You hold it like a dart and it wo n't hurt me any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder and Fish wanted to kiss her , but she took the syringe from him and demonstrated how on his arm , not putting the needle in but touching this skin , a pin pressure , an indent . " It is n't good for you , " Fish said . " Silly baby , " Marcia said . " It 'll be good for both of us . " She put the syringe in his hand and lay back under that white moon and closed her eyes , and Fish went down to her thigh , holding the syringe like a dart , indenting , then puncturing , and Marcia made a slow sound , a pleased sound , an mmmmm , and he pushed the piston with his thumb until it was all in her , and he slid the needle from her and kissed the spot of blood , then moved a little and kissed the warm , soap-smelling hair between her thighs , kissed her breathing smooth stomach . He darkened her breasts with his shadow and she reached down and held him while he grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " C'm on , baby , " and soon he felt the Demerol working , making her loving frantic and long , and , deep in the night , when they had ceased lovemaking and she was sleeping , he curled close to the sensual curve of her back , and he could feel the feverish twitching of her muscles , a yearning : a dreaming of her soul long after her flesh was asleep . <p> Somewhere in front of the bus , Big John Casper is making his deals . He is a mountain of a man , dressed in a jean shirt and leather vest , a grizzled beard that he keeps barely trimmed , so that the bottom of his throat is still a pale , furry black . He has black eyes and laughs loudly : Fish hears him through the open suite door calling business partners on the bus phone and hamming it up with the driver . Big John Casper loves the wheel and deal , and that 's the big difference between himself and Big John , Fish knows : Fish was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call from his bus phone , loves moving about his home office in Hendersonville , the walls full of records in frames and photographs of him keeping company with fame . He encourages the young ones , like Tellulah DuBois , the twenty-four-year-old knockout singer whose deep laughter Fish can hear up front now also , that sound a momentary stirring that makes him want to get up and go there and watch the way her chestnut hair moves , and her long , smooth legs that rise to pastel shorts . Tellulah : the name is smooth in his mind and he closes his eyes . Big John loves the young girls he can be a papa to ; he loves sitting and typing the road schedules , the places they will go , the sizes of predicted audiences : August 25 : Lonoke , Arkansas , Dilly Regional High School , anticipated audience 500 ; August 27 , 28 : Shelbyville , Texas , Amphitheater , anticipated audience 2,000 . Autograph party afterward ! Big John keeps the wheels turning , his friends on the road , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big John with the white teeth . It is easy to love Big John . Big John , who met Fish for the first time , found out he hailed from Boston , and said , <p> Yank , what 're you doing here ? <p> On the TV , the actress Linda Kozlowski fills her canteen at the edge of a waterhole , and Fish watches her along with Mick Dundee : her long legs , smooth back , cleft of spine . Fish has seen the movie a few times now , and this is his favorite part . With the exception of Tellulah DuBois , he has never seen a woman so beautiful . <p> " She 's some looker , " Bones says , awake now on the other bunk , his eyes blinking . <p> " Yes , man , " Fish says . <p> " I 'd take two of her on a Popsicle stick , " Bones says . <p> " Amen , " Fish says . He puts an arm over his forehead and watches until Crocodile walks through New York for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dundee is that he is an exile who knows how to make himself at home . <p> He sleeps through the rest of the movie . In that strange gray dreaming area he moves through a day a few weeks ago , mowing the lawn to earn his keep at the Nashville West apartments . He is sweating in the July sun . Fish looks up to where the voice is calling him . " Hey , " the woman says , and Fish can hardly see her with the sun high above . " Can you come on up here ? " <p> Fish goes up metal steps that resonate beneath his sneakers , and he thinks about this woman , whose name he does not know , who lies out often under the sun on the lawn he has just been mowing . She suns with her top undone and loose , so that with a little imagination Fish can feel his fingers brushing against the cloth strips over her chest and shoulders , the texture of that cloth : running the pad of his forefingers beneath the straps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would look at her eyes and there would be heat there , above the sexy pout of her mouth . He would bite her dark skin and her nipples , and feel her body start to move with him . <p> She is pouting about the stove when Fish makes it to the coolness of her apartment , and he is suddenly aware of the hurt in his head from the sun , of the sweat running through the hair of his chest , down to where his shirt is tied around his waist . The woman 's eyes notice , too . She has hair so black it looks nearly blue in the indoor light . <p> " You were some country singer once , somebody told me , " she says , as the coolness moves through Fish like a new kind of breathing . <p> " I 've done some , " Fish says . He is glad that half of the shirt is hanging over his shorts . The woman is wearing a T-shirt , and she looks freshly-showered and clean , and Fish can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Somebody also told me you were married , " this woman says . <p> " I do n't have her anymore , " Fish says . <p> Fish knows this woman sees into his eyes , then : into a place where lately he wishes women could not see so easily . He lowers his eyes , and there is silence for a moment . He thinks about changing the subject back to the stove , but then thinks the hell with it . When he looks up again his expression has changed . He is not shy about anything now . Neither is she . " I guess you know where to find the shower in these places , " the woman says , before she walks into the bedroom . <p> But the lovemaking is nothing like Fish has dreamed . The woman lies naked under cool sheets for him when he comes from the water , and he hardly dries himself in his wanting of her flesh , liking the feeling of coming down against her with his wet skin on her smoothness , of going wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge about her  --  still , even , her name  --  a sensation that disturbs him for the first time in his life ; their lovemaking is more athletic than passionate ; more coolness than hot sun , too quick for sweat . Before he leaves , Fish promises to come back and fix the stove . <p> It is later in the day now and Fish sits with Big John in the high school theater , three hours before the show begins , watching the musicians and roadies set up instruments and amplifiers , connect cables . He can smell Big John 's Old Spice cologne and feel his weight beside him ; they sit with beater cowboy boots propped against the row of chairs in front of them . Bones is hitting some slap-notes ; Steely tunes with harmonics ; Jimmy Wiley sets up his pedal steel . Tom is trying the position of his bass drum , and Allen plays a few notes on the synthesizer . Then Tellulah walks in : Fish can see her coming from way back , where the black stage curtains are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through the band . She touches Bones , Steely , and Allen as she passes them , and they straighten from their hunched positions and smile , and come alive like flowers under the sun . She walks up to the microphone stand in tight jeans that she has sewn patches of all colors on . She wears a white tank top that hugs twin curves of breasts , and Fish thinks about those breasts , chestnut hair , bare arms , green eyes , the fingers now lightly touching the stand . <p> " Sing a few , honey , " Big John bellows . " Let 's see how we sound . " <p> The band kicks off , and Tellulah starts singing . Big John leans over to Fish and says , not for the first time , " Man , she 's gon na go <p> places . " John says that about everybody he works with , but Fish thinks he might be right about this girl . She 's already fronted some shows for Reba McEntire , and now she sings one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting . She unclips the microphone and walks across the stage , and Fish knows that she 's not doing a sound check anymore . He feels it as she does : she 's singing to an audience that will be there tonight , and ten years from now . She 's moving to the sound of Tom 's click-track , to the rhythmic slide of Bone 's bass , to the sad notes of pedal steel guitar and piano lifting and falling . Her hands reach to the imaginary audience as if reaching for a lover . <p> She sings through a few numbers , and then comes out to sit with Fish and John . She slides in next to Fish , touches his forearm . " Hi , Mr. Yank , " she says . <p> " Sounds good , girl , " Fish says , smiling . <p> " Mm hmm , " Big John affirms . <p> " That 's what I need to hear , " Tellulah says . Her eyes and body , so close , flirt with Fish . He 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs beside him , to see what would happen . But it would n't feel right here , not with Big John , and he does n't know exactly what Tellulah 's flirtation means anyway . He 's seen all kinds of flirtation in this business : performers wanting reassurance , women wanting a moment of love , and then forgetting you . Tellulah talks to John about the sound , and Fish watches her lips , her tongue wetting their dryness , her eyes dancing occasionally with his own . <p> It is a place of gray Fish sees now . Not the brightness and precision of spotlights , nor the different hues in darkness with a woman he loves . It is a place of gray . <p> After the woman at the apartment complex , Fish went back to his place and showered again and sat on his bed with his guitar as evening fell , until he and the music seemed to blend with the shadows . He kept a beer by his side , and the darkness came completely and still he played , humming one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to F and it made Fish think of a field in Massachusetts , of a bright day years ago : he could see trees bend and sway with gusts of wind , a hawk holding steady in the sky , cocking its head over the flowing grass . And then Fish realized , with that familiar rush , that the tune he was playing was new and it was his , and he switched on the lights and , blinking , his spirit singing , he found paper and pen and a telephone book to write on and he went to work on his new song . <p> And then it is night and there are n't nearly the five hundred in the theater that Big John said there would be . Fish waits by a stack of crates at the side of the stage while Tellulah opens the show . She 's dressed in a splendid white leather suit that is filled with sparkling white and blue rhinestones . Fish can see , through the light of the stage , the shining eyes in the front rows of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , of vacant seats , and Big John comes up the back steps next to Fish and says , " Shee-it , Yank . I ai n't pulling them in no more . " Fish smiles and says , " Screw it , man . We 're old farts anyway . But she is n't . " They laugh and watch Tellulah , and Fish feels John go through his routine of mopping his forehead with a kerchief , sucking in his belly beneath a brown leather and rhinestone vest , and clicking his stage boots against the floorboards in time with Tellulah 's last song . " Go get ' em , " Fish says . " Come relieve me , " Big John says , " soon , " as Tellulah is saying , " You saw him last night on Nashville Now , " and Big John 's smile spreads for the act . He lumbers , mountain roly-poly , arms and legs shaking , clapping a cowboy hat atop his head , singing Chuck Berry 's " Johnny B. Goode , " out into the spotlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoses and ropes hanging on the walls , hearing Steely go into the ride . He goes to the men 's room , and the sound is more faint . There is a bench there , on the tile floor , under a light that flickers green , and all of the band 's clothes hanging from a toilet stall . He urinates , then undresses , and puts on tight jeans , stage boots  --  lizard skin , the last gift Marcia gave him before she said she could n't live his hours anymore and he said he could n't live her habit anymore-and a white country shirt . He puts on a ten-gallon hat . He thinks about Chuck Berry singing in the stars : the article he read in some truck stop somewhere , about the capsule shooting through space with a drawing of a man and a woman , and a recording of <p> Chuck Berry and the Beatles and Beethoven , so that if another civilization finds the capsule , the article read , they will know what humankind looks and sounds like . Fish walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wooden steps up into the noise , then to the shadows of stage left , and he is with the music again , taking his guitar from the crate he leaned it against . It is a Guild F-50 , the same kind of large-body acoustic Elvis had once , too , when he was young and still a great singer and not yet a movie star . Fish throws the strap over his head and shoulder , plugs in his jack ; he likes the reassuring feel of the roundback against his belly , the darkness he hums a few notes in , bringing the body of the guitar up to his ears , likes the bright slip of music and lights before him , too , the smell of music and lights : performers , sweat , crates , metal strings , wood , heat of drums . " All the way from Boston , " a sweating Big John says now , above the driving beat , " the man with more hits than I got fingers , folks , the Tennessee Yank himself . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the stage with the rhythm , his upper body and guitar facing the audience , his eyes hard on his fingers . He hears yells and scattered , enthusiastic clapping ; they recognize his song , and for a moment , even in the act , Fish could cry with the glad , huge feeling in his chest . The feeling sweeps his nose and eyes , and then he is back again , seeing his fingers hit A , seeing audience , seeing the windscreen of the microphone : <p> Well I 'm so low down , pushed round , fightin ' mad You 're runnin ' out on me with every fancy Dan Before we 're all through I 'll ask you one more time Honey for your daddy wo n't you walk the line <p> The audience is clapping , yelling , and to Fish 's right a fat man is standing , pounding his fists rhythmically into the air beside a startled wife . <p> You are my heart mate , soul mate , one-time dream Mississippi summer sunny dreamboat queen , So baby do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't you walk the line <p> Fish looks back as Tom does the fill , sees Bones and Big John grinning . And he sees Tellulah , standing back at another microphone , watching him as she gets ready for the harmony , and watching him in another way , too , her eyes wet and full of hope . <p> Hey do n't you think it 's time you treat this old boy right ? Honey for your daddy wo n't you walk the line <p> Steely goes into the ride . The audience roars . They like this one . It reminds them of a time they met a lover . It reminds them of a time with best friends in a bar . It reminds them of a summer night , a rustle of leaves . A high school prom . A mouth coming close to kiss . Fish tips back his hat , closes his eyes , hits E-sharp to A , feeling these chords through his fingers , his belly , his chest and blood and heart . <p> In between stardom and obscurity there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that night , as he sings . You 're a forever dreamer , Fish . But all you ever dreamed of was singing the songs for anyone who would listen : nothing else mattered . Others , like Big John over there , playing piano under the spotlight , thrive on the circus . Big John carries himself that way , loves the watching eyes , the applause and laughter , loves being a clown . I am somehow lucky , Fish thinks . I know the circus and also the great gray places , the great geography of dreams where songs are born . <p> It is midnight now in Lonoke , Arkansas . The band has showered and loaded equipment into the bottom compartment of the bus . Fish has breathed the hot , wet air of night , then boarded the bus for the short hop through this small town to the restaurant with the neon sign that reads CATFISH , ALE U CAN EAT . Next to the sign is a giant blue bug-zapper . There are some cars and an old white ambulance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for an ambulance in a joint like this . The inside of the restaurant is dirty : the tile floors have not been washed and the counter where they all lean in to order is greasy . " It ai n't the Ritz , but it 's free , " Big John jokes with his band quietly , leaning in to order steak , before going over to the table where businessmen of the town and their wives sit , back to his wheeler dealer , happy to sign autographs , smile . Bones and Steely press a string of George Strait hits into the jukebox , and Fish sits next to Tellulah . He likes her clean smell next to him , like lilacs , her fmgers resting lightly on the tablecloth . He watches the other diners , the regulars , their slumped backs at the counters , the teenagers , the workers getting off shift who sit at tables and look <p> at the strange band of outsiders and do not talk . Tellulah watches Fish 's curiosity , drapes her arm casually over the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand like a moment of true , warm sun at the start of summer . They look at each other briefly and are sitting together that way when Bones , fumbling with his fork across the table , starts hissing , " I ca n't feel the fucking fork I ca n't feel the fucking fork , " his eyes wide and frightened , and then he is yelling and Big John is rising in the distance , through smoke and tables and diners , frowning , as if he knows already that this is going to be a bad situation and he 'll have to take care of it . <p> " We 'll fly a bassist down to Shelbyville , " Big John says later , standing near Fish in front of the cool bus , the lights out and only pinholes of light above and in front , with the driver , so that Fish sees one side of Big John 's face : an alert eye , a nose , black whiskers . Beyond Big John and the driver , Fish sees the endless dashes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and turns away , walks down the rolling runway , slides into a lower bunk at the side of the bus where he has stored his bags . He closes the curtain , and in that six-by-three closed blackness , he thinks about Bones , riding now in the star suite , speaking his fear to Steely in the darkness ) Bones will fly back to Nashville for tests tomorrow , all expenses paid by Big John . And Fish will be  --  where had John said ? Shelbyville , Texas . Fish remembers the copy : August 27 , 28 : Shelbyville , Texas , Amphitheater , anticipated audience 2,000 . Autograph party afterward ! Fish takes a tape recorder from a bag , slides a Reba tape in . He lays back and Reba sings softly to him in the night , slow and sad . <p> The curtain parts , and Fish feels rather than sees Tellulah sliding in beside him ; feels her weight and female warmth nestle to him , smells her shampoo . He watches her face close to him : her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his neck . They do not speak . He holds her , feels her few years in her embrace . It makes him young , and Reba sings . <p> Fish is not sad ; he does n't know what he is , exactly . He feels like maybe he should go back with Bones . But Tellulah presses close , and he does n't want to think about Bones anymore . He thinks about Reba 's song , and the other music , too : Chuck Berry , and the Beatles , and Beethoven , that small , bright star singing to the heavens . He holds Tellulah tightly , and doses his eyes , and hums with Reba in the rolling darkness . <p> <p> By JOSEPH HURKA <p>
