<p> When the 50th Earth Day rolls around in the year 2020 , will Atlantans celebrate the achievements of a well-focused environmental vision ? Or will they bemoan the results of a myopic approach to managing Georgia 's most basic resources ? <p> There is much to celebrate now , on Earth Day 's silver anniversary . Georgia 's rivers and air are cleaner than in 1970 , chemical pollution is more controlled , and most Americans want to safeguard environmental quality . <p> Whether or not Congress repeals federal environmental legislation , the essential truth of Earth Day remains : People care about the places where they live , work and play , and protecting those places requires personal involvement . <p> Georgia 's growing human population has outpaced many of the environmental gains made since 1970 , and threatens many places we hold dear : the mountains , the plains , the coast - even our own back yards . What makes Georgia so remarkable can not be sustained unless each one of us gets involved . <p> Hatcher is president and CEO of the Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Markets Inc. is building a grocery store on every corner in Gwinnett County . Why should we suffer for Publix 's battle with Kroger ? Who will win ? Nobody ! If Publix wins , what will happen to the empty Kroger stores ? <p> If Publix and Kroger would like to prove a point , let them prove it somewhere else . <p> Elevate people HARRY E. GOGGINS , Winston <p> There has been much discussion lately about saving Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium . The two primary arguments against keeping the structure seem to be the need for additional parking and the promise made to the neighborhood . At the same time , there are frequent complaints about both the stadiums being so far off the existing MARTA lines . <p> Why has n't someone suggested an elevated people-mover ? It could be built from the Omni Station , with one stop at the underutilized Garnett Street Station , and end between the two stadiums at Georgia Avenue . <p> Such a people-mover would solve the parking problem , and the people in the neighborhood should love it , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North-South and East-West rail lines . <p> Trail mix WILL JAMES , Atlanta <p> ( Regarding the recent story about closing Vickery Creek National Recreation Area to mountain bikes : ) <p> I have ridden my mountain bike in Vickery Creek and Cochran Shoals for the past five years . I strongly disagree with accusations that bikers are eroding these trails . <p> I admit there is a problem with bikers passing hikers at fast speeds . It is the mountain bikers ' responsibility to ride sensibly . However , this is not a reason to exclude bikers from these trails . <p> A logical solution is to limit trail access to bikers and hikers . This philosophy has worked well in Tsali National Recreation Area in western North Carolina , where bikers and horseback riders alternate trail access depending on the day of the week . <p> My solution to the problem at Vickery Creek would be to cut more trails for biker and hiker use , but alternate the trails ' accessibility to create hiker-only and biker-only trails . The " erosion " problem could be controlled by switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions exist . <p> It is very sad that just as Atlanta is preparing to host the 1996 Summer Olympic Games - where mountain biking will be an official Olympic event for the first time - the community is banning the sport . <p> Evolution DON CALDWELL , Marietta <p> ( Regarding ) a full-page spread in last Saturday 's Reader headlined " Darwin with a twist : Medical discipline seeks explanation through evolution " : <p> That one can know about the marvels of the human body , the beauty of nature that surrounds us , the awesome majesty of the heavens , and still believe that all this originated from primordial slime without a designer is mind-boggling . <p> Belief in an omniscient God does not require a giant step of faith . Belief in evolution , on the other hand , requires gigantic gullibility . <p> Works for welfare YUSEFF SHABAZZ , College Park <p> ( Regarding the GOP 's $ 500-a-child tax credit , ) a recent letter writer said , " To postulate that a person would be motivated to have children for $ 500 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative Republican credo on welfare ? Is n't it their belief that a woman goes through nine months of pregnancy , hours of labor , then 18 years of child-rearing for an average of $ 40 a month ? <p> WITNESS TO THE EXECUTION <p> On April 7 , Nicholas Lee Ingram , a U.S.-British citizen , was executed at the Georgia Diagnostic Center . He was sentenced to death for killing J.C . Sawyer of Cobb County during a 1983 robbery . In last Sunday 's Perspective section , Ingram 's attorney recounted the convicted killer 's last days . Reader response was fast and furious : Ingram got exactly what he deserved . Several letter writers from Britain and one from Scotland , however , registered their disdain for capital punishment - " American barbarism , " one called it . <p> No excuses DAVID M. GREEN , Mableton <p> Like Nicholas Ingram , I was abused as a child . But Ingram failed to seek out the help that he needed and chose to commit murder , for which he was tried , convicted and executed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A history of abuse can never excuse or justify the crime that he alone chose to commit . <p> Enough said JIM CHAMBERS , Tucker <p> In last Sunday 's Perspective section , attorney Clive Stafford Smith wrote that his client , Nicholas Lee Ingram , who was executed for murder , was not allowed to die with dignity . <p> Good . Ask the condemned LINDA MARTIN , Birmingham <p> In his Perspective article about the execution of Nicholas Ingram , Clive Stafford Smith asks , " What do you talk about to someone who is about to be killed ? " Perhaps the answer comes from the soon-to-be- executed . Ask them what they talked about with the person they were about to kill . Ask if they gave the victim a chance for a last meal , a final word , a prayer and , above all , a chance to spend years hanging on while others rallied to save their life . <p> Reflection time STEPHEN K. WOODBURN , Lawrenceville <p> It was with utter disbelief I read the article by Clive Stafford Smith , lawyer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Why did n't you , instead , solicit an essay from Mary Eunice Sawyer , the victim who survived ? Maybe she would have written of the overwhelming horror she felt as Ingram marched her husband and her into a field and tied them to a tree . Or what it was like to watch her husband 's head blown off and then suffer a gunshot to her own head that miraculously did n't kill her . <p> Ingram did n't give the Sawyers 12 years to reflect on their lives as the state gave him to reflect on his useless life . <p> Saving lives KATHI MILLS , Norcross <p> Clive Stafford Smith 's letter made me sad , in that people still coddle criminals while ignoring the plight of their victims . Smith whined about how unjustly Ingram was treated . However , Smith did n't bother to mention how unjustly J.C . and Mary Eunice Sawyer were treated : Ingram broke into their home , stole money from them , tied them to a tree and shot them . ( Mrs. Sawyer survived . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingram 's execution in some sort of political game . I 'd like to thank Charron for preventing Georgia taxpayers from supporting this animal and running the risk that he might escape and slaughter more innocent people . <p> Canonizing killer KERRY SMALL , Tucker <p> Are we to pity Nicholas Lee Ingram because he felt the preparation process for execution treated him like an animal and he could have no cigarettes ? Were J.C . Sawyer and his wife treated more humanely when they were strapped to a tree and shot for $ 60 and an old pickup ? Did Mr. Sawyer die with dignity ? <p> The real victims in this tragedy are the Sawyers and society . Mr. Stafford Smith 's canonization of a murderer is offensive and reprehensible . <p> ' A difficult responsibility ' VICKI C. GAVALAS <p> I empathize with the emotions felt by Clive Stafford Smith at the execution of Nicholas Lee Ingram . It was an emotional and exhausting ordeal for everyone involved . There are more than 13,000 Department of Corrections employees whose job is to carry out the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer to commissioner , we are charged with a difficult responsibility in carrying out a death sentence . We strive to implement our duties as effectively and efficiently as possible while at the same time preserving the integrity and dignity of all , including the inmate . <p> Nicholas Ingram 's head was shaved at 6:01 p.m. , Thursday , April 6 , later than what our procedures dictate because his visitation was extended that day . The institution received confirmation of the stay of execution from the U.S. district judge 's office at 6:15 p.m . <p> The description of Ingram 's demeanor and perception of his stare is each individual witness ' " truth . " The fact , however , is that the window separating the witness room and the execution chamber is just that : a window . It is not a one-way mirror . Anyone standing or sitting in the execution chamber can see and be seen . <p> The fact also remains that Nicholas Ingram was found guilty of a heinous murder and duly sentenced to death . It is highly unlikely that Nicholas Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , the Sawyer family , the witnesses to his execution , to the warden at whom he spat or even to the attorneys who argued both sides of his case . Some things are just hard to forget . <p> Gavalas is director of public information for the Georgia Department of Corrections.
