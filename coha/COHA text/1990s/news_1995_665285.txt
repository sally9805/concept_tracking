But the crowd was thinking back 50 years and remembering another war . <p> The pilots were among some 500 U.S. airmen shot down by the Germans in central Serbia during World War II and saved by the anti-Nazi Chetnik fighters of Gen. Dragoljub Mihailovic . <p> " That was the largest rescue of American lives behind the enemy line in the history of the U.S. , " said retired Maj. Richard L. Felman of Tuscon , Ariz. , his voice choking as he addressed the crowd . <p> " It 's 50 years of emotion that built up in me and there is no way to get it out . " <p> The celebration paid tribute to the Chetnik fighters and Mihailovic , the first Yugoslav leader to rise against the Germans . President Harry Truman honored Mihailovic with the Legion of Merit award . <p> Saturday 's commemoration had a political tone because it was led by Vuk Draskovic , head of the largest opposition party in Serbia and an enemy of Socialist President Slobodan Milosevic . <p> Felman , his wife Myriam , and fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the current role of the Serbs .

Serbs are Eastern Orthodox . <p> The rally was held where Mihailovic 's anti-Nazi resistance began in 1941 , on the Ravna Gora plateau 60 miles southwest of the Serbian capital , Belgrade . Mihailovic 's royalist and nationalist forces rose against the Nazis two months before Communist leader Josip Broz Tito launched his own uprising . <p> In 1944 , the Allies switched their support to Tito . Fighting between his partisans and the Chetniks intensified , and Mihailovic is alleged to have stopped attacking Germans in some areas . <p> After the war , Mihailovic was sentenced to death in what many claimed was a rigged trial . He was executed in 1946 .

" <p> " Any time any American journalist , any American politician says that the Serb people are barbaric , cruel , aggressors , I would submit that they ask thousands of U.S. grandchildren who are alive today solely because the Serbs saved " their grandfathers , Felman said . <p> " As an American , I feel a little sad because for this 50th anniversary of V-E Day , American veterans were sent to Germany , the enemy , to Italy , the enemy , but not here , to our allies .
