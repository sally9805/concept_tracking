Roll over , Alexis de Tocqueville . The oft mentioned ( but less frequently read ) 19th century French scribe is being invoked by every dime-store scholar and public figure these days to bemoan the passing of what the Frenchman described as one of America 's distinctive virtues : civic participation . " Americans of all ages , all conditions and all dispositions , " he famously wrote , " constantly form associations . " In France , Tocqueville observed , a social movement is instigated by the government , in England by the nobility , but in America by an association . Tocqueville and small d democrats from Ben Franklin ( who started a volunteer fire brigade ) to John F. Kennedy ( who told Americans not to ask but to do ) have warned that the health of American democracy depends on vigorous civic participation . <P> That is why Robert Putnam 's 1995 essay " Bowling Alone " touched a national nerve . Putnam , a Harvard professor of government , used the catchy image of more Americans bowling by themselves and fewer in leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long , slow decline for the past 25 years . Citing diminished participation in organizations like the PTA and the League of Women Voters , Putnam 's essay seemed to reinforce a widespread feeling that civic life in America just was n't what it used it to be . The nation 's diminishing social capital was lamented far and wide , from Bill Clinton 's bully pulpit to angry sermons by Bill Bennett to Bill Bradley 's eloquent envoi to the Senate . <P> So widely accepted is this notion of civic decline that both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole have been exhorting Americans to pull up their socks . ( Rhetoric is free ; programs cost money . Besides , who is n't for volunteerism ? ) Clinton has used a series of Executive actions regarding teen smoking , gun sales and truancy as a paternal prod  --  in effect , making the Federal Government the village patriarch who reminds members of the community of their obligations to one another . Last week Clinton introduced a schoolhouse-repair program , which is meant to spur local investment , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would help those who help themselves , " Clinton declared . As for Dole , he often uses as a metaphor the cigar boxes of cash that his neighbors in Russell , Kansas , raised for him when he was a wounded vet , while his wife says that as First Lady she will encourage Americans to give 5% of their income to charity and 5% of their time to volunteerism.
