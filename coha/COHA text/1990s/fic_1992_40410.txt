Elevator Sickness . <p> No one , not even my husband Curtiss , knows my fear of elevators . A door closes and you rise in a cube of perishable air . <p> Your container hesitates at first , then gathers speed . You hang on a cable which , like you , has a finite lifespan . Perhaps already 's it 's beginning to fray . <p> No one known my fear of elevators because , with another adult , it 's not so bad , just a little shiver I can shrug away . But alone , I have to clench my fists . Now I 'm holding Conrad , and it 's worse . He 's only six months old , unaware that we 're dangling by a thread . I listen to our breathing and to the whispery groans of the cogs and wheels that hold us up . Which sound is more alive ? <p> Against the closed steel doors , I see sunlight , a city falling away . I 'm there again , high above gray city towers and a muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm rising into an air too pure to breathe . Then the sunlight clears like mist , leaving the red button that says alarm , the silver button that says open . I flex my fingers . If we survive this elevator , I promise , next time Conrad and I will climb the steps , seven flights of them , to Mrs. Pierce 's apartment . But already I know that 's not true . I 'll take this ride again and again . <p> The doors open . Ahead of me , there 's a long murky hall , and the world swings right again . <p> Hilda Pierce meets me at her apartment door , small , gray-haired , and brisk , with aviator glasses . She gives me instructions so clear I do n't have to think . <p> " You can start here in the living room , " she says , and disappears . <p> I stand still , enveloped by tidiness . The carpet , the wood and upholstery are pale shades approaching white . How can I clean this apartment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been ? Then I remind myself : my feet are on steady ground . I have nothing to worry about . <p> Hilda Pierce is a new customer . There are more every week . I advertise in the paper , I ask my customers to tell their friends about me . Mrs. Robbins talks to me constantly without ever finishing a sentence . Her words trail off or run together . I do n't mind . I 'm not really listening anyway . Every now and then I catch a fragment : " You 're so reliable , Jane . Some of the other women are n't clean . And they 're angry if you ask them to do the simplest thing . " <p> This is the reason for my success . I do n't frighten women like Mrs. Robbins . They think it 's cute that I wash dishes and mop floors with a baby strapped on my back . " You young women are so enterprising , " Mrs. Robbins says . Sometimes she refers vaguely and apologetically to my " bad luck . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer into a rooming house across town . Curtiss has n't abandoned Conrad and me in the way that Mrs. Robbins thinks . He wants to give us money , but I wo n't take it . What he wo n't give us is time . He prefers poring over books and computers , lost in a haze of numbers . <p> Curtiss 's mother called me last week and said to be patient . " Think of his work . " I heard the awe and discomfort in her voice . Curtiss was the first in his family to go to college , and now he 's in graduate school , studying things no one in our home town could pronounce . He 's studying what holds stars together , why they do n't go flying off in all directions . He 's studying attractions and repulsions so delicate that no word can name them . Only numbers can , sometimes . <p> Curtiss likes to talk about his work , grinning when he outlines some difficult problem . People will listen , smiling and nodding , nodding and smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about , but he goes on anyway . <p> " You should go back to school yourself , " Curtiss 's mother said . Ever since I was a kid playing with Curtiss , she 's tried to be a mother to me . Because I did n't have one of my own . <p> " Maybe I 'll go back , " I said , thinking , where would I get the money for school ? Where would I get the time ? " Someday , " I said . <p> From behind the coats in Hilds Pierce 's closet , I drag out the vacuum cleaner , sleek and sprouting attachments lie exotic flowers . Its well-mannered whine wo n't disturb Hilda , paying bills in the next room . I push it across the pearl-gray rug until the room hums with well-being . Conrad chuckles and clucks against my shoulders . I rub my sweat into the window frames and end tables , along with lemon oil . A sweet , tart scent , like fruit that has failed to ripen , hangs in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shoe store for a while , but Conrad screamed and upset the babysitter . Then I put him in a daycare center , where he slept through the day . He started keeping me up nights wanting to play , turning on the dazzling toothless smile he 'd saved up for me all day . One morning , I slept through work and lost my job . <p> Now , dusting Hilda Pierce 's white living room , I can believe that this colorless expanse - empty space is a luxury , I know now - and these light-filled windows are mine . In the kitchen , with its smell of coffee and wood , those little glass jars tucked in their rack over the stove , stuffed with cinnamon and cloves , tarragon and rosemary , promise me good things : hope , sweetness , savor , waiting to be uncorked . I take down the jar of minced garlic , and wipe away a spatter of grease and tomato . Then I think of my trailer in University Park , where the television and the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells of diapers , orange peels , and sour milk crusted in glasses . <p> At five o'clock , Hilda Pierce reappears with money in an envelope . I take it and carry Conrad past the elevator to the staircase . Conrad likes the bumps as we go down . Her crows gently . He 's always showing me these little attentions , now that I have given up Shoe World for him . As I clump down seven flights , he cheers me on . My legs ache , along with my back . I consider sitting down on the steps . But I do n't think I would get back up . <p> Right now , Curtiss and his friends are having a picnic in the park . He invited me too , but I turned him down . Curtiss always invites me to these functions . He envisions some cheerful happy-go-lucky relationship for us now , sort of like going steady . This is just while he 's getting used to graduate school , he says . <p> I drive to the mall for a hamburger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , her biscuit-colored raincoat a map of stains and spills , her gray hair flyaway and defiant . She does n't have her lumpy plastic bag , so I guess she 's not working today . Usually , she raids the trash for cans and returnable bottles . She sits down on a bench , hands pressed together , lips moving in some silent incantation . Our glances meet , hers fiery with recognition . Last week , she caught me staring at her , and she spat at me . But I did n't mean anything , I was n't even looking at her , really . Like her , I spend lots of time here now . I have time to stare at whatever comes by . <p> Now I speed the stroller past the old woman 's glare . Then I think : this woman is the only person who 's really looked at me today . <p> I wheel Conrad into the parking garage dusk , fold up his stroller , and buckle him in . When we drive out into the evening , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town again , not sure how to end this white blank of a Saturday . People are queuing up outside the Bijou for the seven o'clock movie , and I slow and park across the street . I do n't know the movie on the marquee , but I carry Conrad over and stand in a long line of couples , men and women with shiny hair and faded clothes . It 's a warm May night . The woman in front of me takes off her denim jacket , white shoulders flashing . The couples laugh and lean close . I catch the tail end of glances , amused and surprised when they see me alone with a baby . I turn and crane as if I 'm looking for someone . Curtiss and I used to come here together , he in his baggy cut-offs , the lights glinting on his lank blond hair and rimless glasses . We 'd hold hands and kiss in the movie darkness . <p> When I reach the ticket booth , the man says , " You ca n't take him in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " he 's quiet . Likes movies . " <p> The man shakes his head . <p> " Please , " I say . <p> He shrugs , embarrassed . He takes my money and hands me the pink ticket . " Make sure he stays quiet . " <p> I 'm glad to get into the theatre darkness , safe , shrouding us like a blanket . Instead of a woman with a child on my shoulders , I could simply be a hunchback . I slide into an aisle seat on the far right , away from everyone . I have an odd , angled view of the screen . The blue-green trees , the luminous pink faces slant away from me as if escaping down a long , crooked street . <p> I unbuckle Conrad and hold him against my chest . He pulls my hair invitingly . I tug it away from him . He pulls it back , laughing at how smart we are to have thought up this game . <p> While we yank at my hair , I watch the screen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman is poor , trying to raise money for an abortion in Sweden . Her lover 's photographer . He takes pictures of her only when she 's miserable . Another woman has children with a handsome Arab who takes her first-born back to his new wife . I 'm lucky it 's a quiet movie , no gunshots , no car chases . In the darkness , I nurse Conrad and he dozes . But after a while , I walk out . <p> The man from the ticket booth is flirting with the woman at the popcorn machine . He wags a finger at me . " I warned you . " <p> " He liked it . I did n't , " I say . <p> I go out to the car , and now the blue sky is dimming around the edges , with a seam of gold over the building . I wish for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing up and down those endless steps in Gay Divorcee or smirking and insulting each other in The Fleet 's In . I could lose myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age lines spidering the film . <p> The French women were like invalids , lovesick and pale . They remind me of my mother the year I was ten , when I decided I would never forget anyone 's face . I would memorize all the people I knew , and never lose anyone . My mother grew whiter and clearer that year , translucent as wax . She did n't die of love . She died because of tiny blood clots , planted like seeds in her brain when she was born . The doctor 's forceps planted them there , and she carried them around with her , and they grew . <p> I could not forgive my father and my baby brother because they seemed to forget . Another woman could clean the house , change the diapers , place the warmed bread in the center of the table . First it was hired help , and then it was my Aunt Claire . <p> After my mother died , we moved . Starting over , my father called it . We ended up in Aurora , Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt roads and in the woodsy corners of his father 's farm . <p> Conrad has fallen asleep . His baby snores are soft as water lapping . I drive out of town , across bridge and into the park , slowing under the darkening trees . I 'm not sure where Curtiss and his friends will be . Dusk has settled down deeply here . The grass and trees have dulled to an earthy , sepia tint . But the sky is brilliant , awash in fleeting blue . I drive down a hill , and there , nestled in a hollow , is the North Pavilion , its floodlight glaring , red charcoal dying in the grill . I dim the headlights and park where I can look down on the pavilion . I do n't want to be seen . I just want to watch . <p> The men are playing a pick-up basketball game around the hoop nailed to the pavilion . I hear shouts , see their raised arms . At a picnic table under a tree , a shadowy cluster of women watch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , Irene 's yellow pony tail . These women are my friends . But they 're also girlfriends of Curtiss 's friends . Jackie is trying to get Roger to move in with her . Irene suspects Mike has another girlfriend . I 've listened to their secrets , but now I 'm out of the circle . Through my rolled-down windows , I hear their voices , rising and falling , a rhythm of polite interest : question , silence , answer . <p> At these parties , there 's always the moment , after the joky , obligatory co-ed games , when the men take the contest to themselves . Under the floodlight , they look golden . One team is playing skins . The light lingers on their bare yellow shoulders . Their hair shines . Curtiss lunges up toward the basket , into the intense light . I see his longish hair , his square hard face . Somehow , in spite of all books and the numbers he 's mastered , it 's still a farmer 's face , like his father 's . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar , a chorus of empty , musical sounds . <p> I sit hugging darkness around me . Curtiss and the others have this game . They move as if flying , intent and forgetful under the floodlight . <p> I check Conrad , still asleep in the car seat , and then I open the door . I walk softly down the slope toward the pavilion , keeping under the trees . An iron sweetness rises from the grass , mingling with the darker , mustier smell of bark and leaves . Someone shouts , " Get it . " The ball bounces wild , and they turn toward me in one motion . I crouch down , a foolish reflex . I feel grass , surprisingly cool , little tendrils curling around my fingers . My palm cups pebbles and releases them soundlessly . I light on a stone , solid with a jagged edge . Its cool heaviness fills my palm . I test its weight , swinging it gently . <p> I choose my moment , while they 're still away from the basket . I stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , a woman allowed to play . In the moment of letting go , I know this angry stone is n't just for Curtiss . It 's for all of them . It 's aimed at their forgetfulness , sleek and golden and free . The way they move like a dance , set apart , while the women wait and watch under the trees . The stone cuts through the air , dark on dark , I ca n't see it , and for a moment I 'm terrified . I do n't want to do real damage . The stone clunks against the basket rim , and drops to the grass . Curtiss taught me to throw like this , when we were kids back in Aurora . Will he know this is a message ? <p> The men fall back , and for a moment they freeze . I 've broken the circle . Then there are shouts . Hey , what the fuck . Over there . Where ? <p> I run back up the hill to the car . Inside , I floor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're running up the slope after me , there 's a tangle of muddy voices . Hey , buddy . Do the same for you some day . You crazy , man ? They think I 'm a man , some drunken student , maybe . <p> I speed out of the park , queasy , heart pounding , as if I really am drunk . I cross the bridge , turn onto a side street and pull over . Up and down the street are quiet houses with porches and glowing windows swaddled in curtains , shutting their brightness inside . <p> Conrad wakes , crying . His hands move up and down , tugging at the air . My father told me that my mother did this in the hospital before she died . She lay still , but her hands kept moving , plucking at the air , like sign language he could n't understand . <p> Just before the last , worst stroke , my mother took my brother and me for a ride in a cable car . We were living in Pittsburgh then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scrolled wooden benches and gold paint . We danced up into a higher , purer atmosphere above the smoggy towers and the gray river , and watched the city fall sickeningly away from us . I held my baby brother tight , as sunlight cut the air out from under us . <p> I sit very still holding the wheel , listening to Conrad 's crying as it slowly quiets . I feel I 'm falling . After a while , I settle in some solid place . I start the car . On the way home , I think of my elevator sickness , of the way I ride the cable car again and again , when I long to stay on the ground . I 'm not like Curtiss , primed for flight . I do n't want to be . <p> " Everything 's all right now , " I whisper to Conrad . I can ride out this terror of lightness , gathering and hardening , in my chest . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
