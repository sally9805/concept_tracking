<p> Former Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. , the progressive voice of the modern court and a justice unequaled for his influence on American life , died yesterday . He was 91 . <p> During his 34 years on the court , Brennan pushed his colleagues to take on a variety of social issues and was widely recognized as the chief strategist behind the court 's civil rights revolution . <p> He was the architect of rulings that expanded rights of racial minorities and women ; led to reapportionment of voting districts guaranteeing the ideal of " one person , one vote ; " and enhanced First Amendment freedom for newspapers and other media . <p> A slight man with a ready Irish grin , Brennan was recognized across the political spectrum not only for his legal mastery but as a defender of individual liberty and a voice of civility . Poor health forced his retirement from the court in 1990 . <p> " He was a remarkable human being , one of the finest and most influential jurists in our nation 's history , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The force of his ideas , the strength of his leadership and his character have safeguarded freedom and widened the circle of equality for every single one of us . " <p> Justice David H. Souter has said of the man he succeeded on the court : " One can agree with the Brennan opinions and one may disagree with them , but their collective influence is an enormously powerful defining force in the contemporary life of this republic . " <p> What distinguished Brennan was his ability to forcefully articulate a liberal vision of judging . It was a vision that found the essential meaning of the Constitution not in the past but in contemporary life , prized individual rights beyond what was explicitly written in the text , and compelled him to reach out to right perceived wrongs . He called the Constitution " a sparkling vision of the supreme dignity of every individual , " and employed it as a tool of racial equality and social justice . <p> " The genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it may have had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in an essay published in 1997 , " but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and present needs . " <p> In the confines of the court 's conference room and chambers , Brennan was renowned for his cunning and persistence , and relentlessness in winning votes for his side . If a justice initially turned him down , Brennan would begin with gentle persuasion , then offer grounds for compromise , then pull out all the stops to try to win another vote . If he lost , he would pursue the justice in the hope he would win on an issue the next time around . <p> In a May 1995 tribute to Brennan to inaugurate the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law , former appeals judge Abner J. Mikva defined " a Brennanist " as " one who influences his colleagues beyond measure . " Retired Justice Harry A. Blackmun said Brennan operated in " quiet but firm tones . " <p> Brennan was appointed to the court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennan 's unmatched ability to build consensus made him a central figure in the Warren Court and a key participant in its most celebrated decisions . <p> He is considered the primary writer of the 1958 Cooper v. Aaron decision that forced school officials to accelerate classroom integration in the face of mass resistance . <p> Brennan also was the author of a 1962 decision that permitted federal courts for the first time to hear constitutional challenges to a state 's distribution of voters , a ruling that brought new fairness to the sharing of political power between rural and urban America . He broadly interpreted the Constitution 's guarantee of due process for criminal defendants , in cases , for example , that protected state defendants against self-incrimination and gave prisoners greater access to federal courts to challenge convictions . " In a civilized society , " he wrote in the latter , " government must always be accountable to the judiciary for a man 's imprisonment . " <p> He led the majority to bolster the right of free speech , including a 1964 opinion that requires public figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the media . <p> To the consternation of his conservative critics , Brennan was not afraid to cross boundaries into areas previously considered off-limits for federal courts . " Our task , " Brennan once said , " is to interpret and apply the Constitution faithfully to the wisdom and understanding of the Founding Fathers . But often it is impossible to make a constitutional decision without basing certain findings on data drawn from the social sciences , from history , geography , economics and the like . " <p> When Warren was succeeded as chief justice by Warren E. Burger and then William H. Rehnquist , the court began to move gradually to the right , and many of the rulings from the Warren era were reversed . But several Brennan decisions endured . Among the most important is Baker v. Carr , a 1962 opinion that gave federal courts the power to ensure the fairness of voting districts , reshaped politics and broadened participation in democracy . <p> Even as he found himself increasingly on the losing side in the 1980s , Brennan remained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the work of the court a personal warmth and friendliness which prevented disagreements about the law from marring the good personal relations among the justices , " Rehnquist once wrote . <p> The chief justice also remarked after Brennan had retired that " the enduring legacy of Justice Brennan  --  the high value which he placed on claims of individual constitutional rights asserted against the authority of majoritarian self-government  --  is in no danger of being forgotten or disregarded simply because he has left the bench . " <p> Georgetown University law professor Mark V. Tushnet , who has read through the private papers of several former justices , said Brennan 's winning personal style added tremendously to his effectiveness . " If you look at the tone with which people responded to his suggestions for changing an opinion , Brennan made it easy . He was friendly and had a tone of accommodation . " <p> A minor stroke and related poor health forced Brennan to retire suddenly in 1990 , but he remained active in liberal causes . In 1994 , a national anti-death penalty project was begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inspiration for a free speech award given periodically by the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression in Charlottesville , Va . <p> Brennan said he hoped to continue effecting change and affecting lives . <p> " Justice Brennan has an abiding belief in the power of thoughts , thoughtful words and good will to reach understanding and solutions that more contentious methods can not , " Vernon E. Jordan Jr. , the civil rights leader and Washington lawyer , said in 1995 when a group of Brennan 's admirers dedicated the Brennan Center . <p> Brennan was born in Newark on April 25 , 1906 , the second-oldest of eight children of Irish immigrant parents . His father worked as a laborer in a brewery and became a union leader and local politician . <p> Brennan was an honors student at the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School of Finance and received a scholarship to Harvard Law School . Upon graduation in 1931 , he joined a Newark law firm , Pitney , Hardin &; Skinner , practicing there until he entered the Army in 1942 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff of the undersecretary of war . <p> He returned to his law firm and began specializing in labor law , representing several large manufacturing enterprises , before being appointed to the New Jersey bench . In 1949 Republican Gov . Alfred E. Driscoll named him to the state superior court . Three years later , Driscoll elevated him to the New Jersey Supreme Court , and Brennan became a reliable lieutenant to Chief Justice Arthur Vanderbilt . <p> Brennan 's nomination to the high court apparently came as a surprise . Then-U.S . Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . telephoned him late one afternoon in his New Jersey chambers and asked that he meet Eisenhower at the White House the next day . <p> Brennan thought nothing of the request and even stopped at Union Station for a hot dog to bide his time , according to Robert M. O'Neil , who would become one of Brennan 's first law clerks . " He did n't expect to get dinner at the White House , " O'Neil said . <p> University of Virginia law professor John C. Jeffries Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis F. Powell Jr. , that Brennan 's shot at the high court was owed to chance . <p> " In 1956 the chief justice of New Jersey , Arthur Vanderbilt , was scheduled to give the keynote address at a large Washington conference on the problem of overburdened courts . Two days before the meeting , Vanderbilt fell ill , and Brennan went in his place . His speech impressed U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell , who , when a Supreme Court vacancy opened four months later , contemplated the electoral advantages to President Eisenhower of appointing an Irish Catholic Democrat from the Northeast and recommended Brennan . " <p> Brennan later said no one in the Eisenhower administration asked him a single question about his politics or judicial philosophy . And indeed , Eisenhower 's choice for the high court marked the third time Brennan had been appointed or elevated to a court by a Republican official . The ability to bridge differences would distinguish his early career on the high court . <p> Brennan succeeded Justice Sherman Minton , who was retiring because of failing health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was confirmed by the Senate March 19 , 1957 on a voice vote . The only audible dissent came from Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy ( R-Wis. ) , who said he was convinced that Brennan was " hostile " to congressional investigations of communism . <p> Brennan had given a speech in 1954 in which he said " there are some practices in the contemporary American scene which are reminiscent of Salem witch hunts . " <p> Brennan was 50 at the time of his appointment , the youngest member of a court that included William O. Douglas , Hugo L. Black and Felix Frankfurter . In 1962 Frankfurter , who taught Brennan at Harvard and was a strong advocate of limiting judicial power , told Look magazine : " I taught my students to think for themselves , but sometimes I think that Bill Brennan carries it too far . " <p> Brennan formed an immediate relationship with Warren , becoming a close ally and developing the legal justifications for the decisions that would result in a social revolution . <p> The Warren Court broadly interpreted the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , that states abide by most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights , a document originally interpreted to safeguard individuals only from the hand of the federal government . Essentially a political actor of the era , the court actively addressed society 's problems , accelerating the civil rights movement , bringing fairness to reapportionment and reforming police practices . <p> When he saw a litigant in need , Brennan 's litmus test for offering legal protection was whether anything in the Bill of Rights explicitly prevented him from doing so . He favored the individual and put the burden on the government to show that something in the Constitution disallowed protection . ( The opposite , " judicial restraint " approach asks whether anything in the Constitution or in the court 's precedents explicitly permits it to extend protection to an individual . ) <p> Brennan and the other Warren-era judges crossed boundaries into areas previously considered off-limits for the federal courts . Before 1962 , for example , the question of whether legislative voting districts were drawn fairly was considered a " political question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not judges . But Brennan said the fairness question was constitutional , not political . Warren would later call the ruling in Baker v. Carr the " most important " of his time on the court . The decision broke rural America 's lock on political power and gave urban voters equal representation to fulfill the principle of one person , one vote , as articulated in later voting rights cases . <p> Brennan also led the court in increasing protections against sex discrimination , writing in 1972 , " distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members . " <p> He had argued that laws treating men differently from women could be justified only by a compelling governmental interest  --  the strictest constitutional test for a law . He failed to win a majority of his colleagues to that standard but eventually succeeded in getting them to agree to an " intermediate " standard of scrutiny still in place . Until these rulings , states could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of ways , imposing different requirements for everything from beer drinking to alimony . <p> In another area of equal rights , Brennan was a strong advocate of affirmative action . In the 1979 United Steelworkers of America v. Weber , he wrote for the court that federal anti-discrimination law does not bar employers from adopting race-based affirmative action programs to boost the number of blacks in the work force and management . <p> In 1990 , his last term , Brennan was the author of a decision upholding Congress 's preferential treatment of blacks and other racial minorities in awarding broadcast licenses . <p> The court said the affirmative action program was justified by Congress 's interest in broadcast diversity . The case , Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission , was overturned in 1995 as the court increased its scrutiny of federal affirmative action programs . <p> When the court invalidated state death penalty laws in 1972 in Furman v. Georgia , Brennan wrote , " Death is an unusually severe and degrading punishment ; there is a strong probability that it is inflicted arbitrarily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human dignity . Death , quite simply , does not . " <p> Four years later , when a majority reinstated the death penalty with a requirement for safeguards on its imposition , Brennan and his colleague and judicial soul mate , Justice Thurgood Marshall , dissented . Toward the end of their tenures on the court ( Marshall retired in 1991 and died in 1993 ) , they were alone in opposition to capital punishment as cruel and unusual punishment . <p> One of Brennan 's best-known opinions is his 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan , which made it harder for public officials to sue the media . <p> In it , he referred to " a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and wide-open , and that it may well include vehement , caustic , and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials . " <p> Like many of his path-breaking opinions , Brennan 's free speech decisions often engendered political outrage . Such was the case for his majority opinions in 1989 and 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the government may not prohibit expression simply because it disagrees with the message . " <p> In the area of religion , Brennan favored a high wall of separation between church and state . Appeals Judge Richard Arnold of Little Rock , Ark. , who as a young lawyer clerked for Brennan , once summed up Brennan 's view : " In short , religion is too important to be co-opted by the state for political or governmental ends . . . . As Justice Brennan understands , public and ostentatious piety can be the enemy of true religion . " <p> Brennan was the author of a 1987 decision , Edwards v. Aguillard , that invalidated a Louisiana requirement that any public school teacher who taught evolution also teach " creation science . " In the related area concerning the free exercise of religion , Brennan penned a majority opinion in 1963 that only a compelling state interest could justify limitations on religious liberty . Rehnquist , who was often on the opposite side of Brennan , wrote after he retired that " Brennan 's abilities as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loaf ' if that were necessary to obtain a court opinion , played a large part in translating what had at first been dissenting views into established jurisprudence . " <p> Brennan first married in 1928 to Marjorie Leonard . They had two sons and a daughter . Marjorie Brennan died of cancer in 1982 after a lengthy illness . The following year , Brennan married Mary Fowler , his secretary of more than 20 years . They announced the news of their wedding to the rest of the court with a memorandum that said : " Mary Fowler and I were married yesterday and we have gone to Bermuda . " <p> In addition to his wife , he is survived by his three children , William J. III , Hugh Leonard , and Nancy , and grandchildren .
