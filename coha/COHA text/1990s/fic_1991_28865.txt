England , 1152 The lady was small and fragile , but with the tall knight standing before her , her frailty was much more apparent . Her blond head reached no higher than his broad shoulders . And when his open palm cracked across her cheek , her thin body jerked to the side with the force of it . A blow like that would have easily sent her to the floor if she were not supported . But she was supported , by two of the knight 's men-at-arms . They stood well behind her , her arms twisted just so to thrust her forward so they would not take a blow meant for her . This kept her upright when she might have buckled , kept her there to receive another blow , and still another . Across the small chamber , Rowena Belleme watched . She also was being held fast by two men-at-arms , the same two who had dragged her into this chamber to witness her stepbrother 's brutality . Blood trickled down the center of her chin from biting her lips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she had not been struck herself . Like as not it would come to that if she did not give in to her stepbrother 's demands after this demonstration of his seriousness , but while his patience held , he did not want to blacken her with bruises that would elicit comment at her wedding . Gilbert d'Ambray had no such qualms regarding his stepmother , however . Lady Anne Belleme  --  nay , she was Anne d'Ambray now and once again a widow , now that Gilbert 's father was dead  --  was of little use to him except as a hostage to Rowena 's behavior . And there was not much that Rowena would not do for her mother . But what Gilbert wanted of her now ... Anne turned to lookat her daughter . Her cheeks were blotched a fiery red with the imprints of Gilbert 's heavy hand , yet she had shed not a tear , nor made a single sound . Her expression , so eloquent , wrung more tears from Rowena . It said plainly , This has been done to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , daughter . Do not give the cur what he wants . Rowena did not want to . Lord Godwine Lyons , the man Gilbert had found to marry her , was old enough to be her grandfather , in truth , her great-grandfather . And her mother had only confirmed the rumors she had heard of this old lord when Gilbert had demanded that Anne convince Rowena to comply with his wishes . " I know Lyons , and he is not for an heiress of Rowena 's stature . Even if his age were not an issue , the man has scandals of perversion attached to his name . Never would I condone such a match . " " He is the only man willing to fight to regain her properties , " Gilbert had pointed out . " Properties your father lost through his greed . " " Nay , it is every man 's right  --  " " To encroach on his neighbor ? " Anne cut in with a full measure of the contempt she felt for her stepson , which was not even a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To raid and make war without recourse ? To steal and force women into marriage before their husbands are even buried ! Such rights only came to men since that weakling Stephen was made king . " Gilbert had actually flushed , but more likely with anger than in embarrassment for what his father had done to Anne . In truth , he was a product of the times . He had been only a child of eight when Stephen had stolen the crown from Matilda after old King Henry died . The kingdom had split apart then , half the barons refusing to accept a woman as their ruler , the other half holding by their oaths to Matilda , and now her son Henry of Aquitaine . Hugo d'Ambray was one of the barons who had then sworn to Stephen , and so he had felt justified in killing Rowena 's father , who was Henry 's vassal , and then forcing Walter Belleme 's widow to marry him , thereby gaining control of all of Walter 's lands , which Rowena as his only child inherited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne nor Rowena had any recourse for this injustice , certainly not from a king who had thrown the realm into anarchy . Unlike his father , who had had a streak of malevolence to complement his brutishness , Gilbert was like most men of his day , respectful when necessary , churlish when not , and intent on filling his coffers with the fruits of other men 's labors . But because he had lived seventeen years with anarchy , his policies were no different from any other baron 's . Most of them might bemoan having such a weak king that the land was rife with lawlessness , but then most of them took advantage and contributed to that lawlessness . Actually , in the three years that Gilbert had been Rowena 's stepbrother , he had never said a harsh word to her , nor laid a hand to her in anger as his father had occasionally done . As a knight , Gilbert was well skilled and courageous . As a man , he was actually very handsome , with black hair and dark brown eyes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hated him only because he was his father 's son . For their own benefit and their petty wars with their neighbors , they had stripped her lands bare and taken everything of value that she and her mother had ever owned . They had broken the betrothal contract her father had made for her , keeping her unwed strictly for their own profit , so they could continue to draw what they could from her serfs ' labors , and demand war service from her vassals each year . But last year Hugo d'Ambray had thoughtlessly decided to take Dyrwood keep , which sat between one of Rowena 's properties and one of his own ...
