Is Rehnquist Getting Itchy ? <P> Retiring Senate majority leader George Mitchell , who last week turned down a nomination to the Supreme Court , may get a second chance to join the court  --  as Chief Justice . Current Chief Justice William Rehnquist , a widower , recently started dating a woman who lives on the West Coast . Sources say he appears to be developing a greater interest in his private life at the same time that he 's tiring of the court 's legal grind . If Rehnquist decides to resign during Clinton 's presidency , Mitchell would probably be the leading candidate for the post .
