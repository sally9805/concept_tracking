<p> DEEP in the rolling hills and arid landscape of the Arizona desert , construction of what has been called " a modern-day Noah 's ark " is almost complete . Under construction for four years , it is already filled with thousands of species of plants and animals . The only remaining task for its builders is to finish the habitat for a special group : eight humans who will be enclosed in Biosphere 2 for the next two years . <p> The privately funded project is an unprecedented attempt to create a closed environment capable of sustaining life for a long period of time . Once its doors are closed sometime early this spring , it will become a self-supporting system similar to the Earth itself ( Biosphere 1 to project organizers ) . The air the humans breathe will be provided by the plants they grow ; the carbon dioxide they exhale will be used by the plants . The air itself will be purified by forcing it through soil that carpets the 2.5-acre structure . If the project is successful , it will yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , but also on how life could be transported to other planets . <p> From outside , the 85-foot-high , 539-foot-long building that houses the project looks as though it could have been transported from the future . The greenhouse-like structure even has its own mission-control center , where more than 30 computers , hooked up to thousands of sensors , monitor changes in temperature , humidity , light , and other conditions in all the ecosystems created for the project . <p> Inside Biosphere 2 , the environment is about as low tech as the supporting structure is high tech . In every direction lush green plants crowd the glass walls and rise toward the cathedral ceiling . Plants have been transplanted from around the world to recreate a rain forest , a marshland , a savanna , and a desert . Adjacent to this wilderness area , a half-acre garden has been planted to grow , without the use of chemicals , more than 100 different types of agricultural plants - including rice , potatoes , and soy - which the " biosphereans " will live on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . It will contain 1,000 of the more than 3,800 species of plants and animals included in the project . <p> " We 're bringing together ecology and technology in a new and exciting way , " says Abigail Alling , a marine ecologist who is director of marine ecological systems in Biosphere 2 , and one of the eight people chosen for the two-year experiment . <p> The ocean Ms. Alling will oversee contains a lagoon , a beach , and a wave machine to simulate tides and waves and to circulate nutrients . The 800,000-gallon tank is home to parrotfish , starfish , anemones , and a Caribbean coral reef that includes 50 species of hard coral and many soft corals . Alling says one of her jobs is to keep a coral reef " alive " while living next door to a stream and saltwater marsh , both of which have a high nutrient content that can be deadly to coral . <p> " If we can succeed in having such a complex system in such a very short space , then it can be applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This type of research can be applied to stressed coral systems around the world , such as those found in the Florida Keys . <p> Although some of Biosphere 2 's research , such as its water recycling methods , may be applicable in creating the support systems needed to colonize space , the research focus is on how environmental processes work and humanity 's impact on them . <p> " Within Biosphere 2 we will be able to monitor the consequences of what we do , " says Linda Leigh , a botanist who is also one of the four women and four men who will live in the project . " In the real world it 's hard for people to see the effects of their individual actions . Inside the biosphere , I expect if we cut down a tree we are going to see a blip on one of the computer monitors . We will be able to measure the effect of one action on the rest of the ecosystems we are living in . " <p> Ms. Leigh , who is the scientific director for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important in restoring environments that have already been damaged . " How do you make a soil ? How do you reclaim a soil ? " she asks . " We have quite a research program on soils in there ; we are working with 30 different types . " She also says other research projects conducted around the world have helped in the creation of Biosphere 2 ecosystems , especially those dealing with the size of habitats . <p> " One project I 'm very interested in is the minimum size biome or environment you can have that still functions as a biome , " Leigh says . She cites research conducted by Thomas Lovejoy , assistant secretary for external affairs at the Smithsonian Institution and a biologist who has received worldwide attention for his work in the rain forest of Brazil . His " **29;204;TOOLONG " focuses on what happens to the patches or " islands " of rain forest that remain after an area is deforested . <p> " What we 've learned from Dr. Lovejoy is that one of the most devastating effects on the small reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side and destroying the understory , " she says . <p> " Using this information we planted a very thick belt of ginger-order plants like the banana and bird of paradise to stop the sunlight from getting to the base of the rain forest we created inside Biosphere 2 . " Leigh says this tactic has proved successful so far . " This is something that might be readapted to Biosphere 1 , " she adds . <p> Lovejoy 's contribution to Biosphere 2 will not be limited to his research in the rain forest ; he also serves as a scientific adviser to the project . To this end he brings not only his experience as a biologist but also insight he has gained as chairman of the United States Man and Biosphere Program ( MAB ) , a scientific project that studies ecosystems throughout the world . Though different in scope , he says both programs offer something unique and of value . <p> " Biosphere 2 is a ' model ' of the real thing . It 's a scaled-down , closed system , and much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things adjust over time , " he says . " On the other hand , the Man and Biosphere program focuses on specific ecosystems and how they respond to manipulation and use by people on an everyday basis . It is a special attempt to link the social and biological sciences , something which is too often overlooked and very hard to do . " <p> Unlike the Biosphere 2 , which is a condensed experiment , the MAB program involves hundreds of " biosphere reserves , " with tens of thousands of species and millions of acres of land scattered around the globe . The key to the MAB program is to study human impacts on different environments and create a global information network to share the scientific research and discoveries . <p> At the heart of the MAB program is the biosphere reserve , a designated area of the Earth divided into three separate areas , each of which represents a typical terrestrial or marine environment . Each reserve has a minimally disturbed , legally protected core area that is surrounded by a buffer zone with boundaries designated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a transition area where people conduct their everyday activities . <p> ONE current MAB project in progress compares land use in the Olympic Biosphere in the Pacific Northwest with that in the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in Tennessee . University of Washington professors Bob Lee and Robert Neiman say these areas , with their diverse habitat and development , offer an excellent opportunity to study how surrounding land ownership and land use affect landscape patterns . <p> " It 's our hypothesis that the large blocks of managed private and public forest land in the Olympic Peninsula have resulted in landscapes with less ecological diversity , habitat abundance , and resource stability than the smaller-parcel ownership in the Appalachia area , " says Dr. Lee . <p> The effort to understand the " minimum critical size " of an ecosystem links the two biosphere projects . <p> Though the projects vary in scale and complexity , Lovejoy says they share two important features . " Both are looking at mankind 's influence on the environment ; both are efforts to understand how this planet really works . "
