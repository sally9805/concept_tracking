The discovery of the first planets outside the solar system surprised most astronomers . It was n't because planets had finally been detected after decades of searching . It was because the planets orbit an unlikely star  --  a pulsar called PSR 1257+12  --  in the constellation Scutum . They expected to find planets orbiting a star much like the Sun , instead of a star near the end of its life cycle . In the case of PSR 1257+12 , the star 's violent death throes as it became a pulsar should have destroyed any planets . Astronomers now believe that the observed planets formed after a supernova explosion created PSR 1257+12 from the more massive star in a binary system . ( See " Lost and Found : Pulsar Planets " in the June 1992 issue . ) The intense radiation from the pulsar evaporated its companion , creating a disk of gas around the pulsar from which the planets formed . Because the planets formed long after the stars , researchers call them second-generation planets . So in spite of their initial surprise , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into existence . But a fundamental mystery still plagues astronomers . They believe first-generation planets orbiting Sun-like stars should be plentiful , forming from the rich gas and dust disks left behind during the birth of the parent star . Yet numerous search teams continue to come up empty-handed . Despite several decades of looking , no confirmed detections of first-generation planets exist , although several intriguing planetary candidates have surfaced . Until recently , the best candidate for a stellar system containing a low-mass companion was a star known by its catalog number , HD 114762 . HD 114762 is a 7th-magnitude star that is slightly hotter than our Sun and located about 90 light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices . David Latham of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and his colleagues studied HD 114762 as one of over 1,500 stars in their survey of stellar motions . They found that the star appears to move periodically toward and away from us every 84 days . The velocity of this radial motion can be measured with a spectrometer . As the star moves toward us , the dark lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum . Later in the orbit when the star moves away from us , the spectral lines shift toward the red . The amount of shifting to the blue and red allows researchers to determine the star 's radial velocity . The simplest explanation for a periodic variation in the star 's radial velocity is that a companion tugs on the star . The companion 's gravity makes the star orbit about the common center of mass between the two objects , just as Jupiter 's gravity makes the Sun orbit their common center of mass . ( If you could put the two objects on the ends of a stick , the center of mass is the point where the stick balances on your fingertip . ) Jupiter 's gravity , for example , induces a 13-meter-per-second solar motion , while Saturn 's produces a 3 m/s motion and Uranus ' only 0.3 m/s . Earth causes the Sun to orbit at 9 centimeters per second , but Jupiter at Earth 's distance from the Sun would create a 28 m/s motion . So by analyzing a star 's radial-velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of mass and find the mass of the companion . The analysis of HD 114762 's orbit by Latham and his team indicated that the companion had a mass of at least 11 times Jupiter 's . But because the unknown tilt of the orbit as seen from Earth affects the mass determination , the companion could be as massive as 80 Jupiters , which is the minimum mass needed for an object to burn hydrogen at its core and thus become a star . The astronomers calculated that there is only a 1 percent chance that the orbit could be tilted nearly face-on . Thus they felt that the companion was not a small star but instead a large planetlike body . Recent high precision measurements by William Cochran and Artie Hatzes of the University of Texas confirm the companion 's orbit ( see page 39 ) . But other measurements by Cochran and Hatzes and by Alan Hale of New Mexico State University indicate that the system may in fact be viewed nearly face-on . The astronomers assume that the companion 's orbit lies in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbits of the planets of our solar system lie nearly in the same plane as the Sun 's equator . By measuring the star 's apparent rotational speed and comparing it with that of stars of similar temperature , they estimate that the companion 's orbit may be tilted by as little as 8 degrees . The small tilt implies that the companion 's mass is near 80 Jupiters , making it a small star and not a planet . With HD 114762 apparently out of the running , astronomers have refocused their planetary search efforts to other stars . LOOKING FOR PLANETS The next best case for a possible planetary companion to a star is Gamma Cephei . Bruce Campbell , Gordon Walker , and their colleagues detected 25 m/s variations in the radial velocity of this star . The variations occurred with a period of 2.7 years , which implies that a companion of 2 Jupiter masses may orbit the star . Of 16 stars in their survey , 7 showed similar variations at a level of 20 m/s . These variations could be produced by objects of 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 50 years . Even though the precision of their measurements was about 10 m/s , it is n't clear that the variations were caused by planets . Although astronomers require additional observations to determine the source of errors in their measurements , systematic errors seem to limit most radial velocity searches to about 10 or 20 m/s over short periods of observation . The cause may not be in the instruments but in the stars themselves . Measurements of the Sun show that its surface pulsates , creating radial velocity variations of up to 10 m/s . Also , hot , rising gas in the Sun 's atmosphere cools as it emits energy , only to sink once again below the Sun 's visible surface . The rising and falling of the gas , called convection , produces spectral-line shifts which astronomers observe as radial velocity variations . The combination of pulsation and convection produces radial velocity variations of 10 to 20 m/s in the Sun . These natural velocity variations are about the same size as the variations expected from planets , so at first glance planetary detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only takes a little longer . Most of a star 's velocity variation occurs randomly . So a program that observes stars regularly for many years can differentiate between the irregular variations of a star 's surface velocities and the periodic motion induced by an orbiting planet . Several such observing programs are under way . William Cochran and Artie Hatzes , Geoff Marcy ( San Francisco State University ) and Paul Butler ( University of Maryland ) , Robert McMillan and his colleagues at the University of Arizona , and Gordon Walker ( University of British Columbia ) and his team have spent years developing observing techniques capable of measuring radial velocities with unprecedented precision . Each group has concentrated on stars of different age or temperature , complementing the objects observed by other groups . But they also observe some of the same stars in order to check one another 's results . To provide the high precision needed for planetary searches , some of the groups use a gas absorption cell placed before the entrance to the spectrometer . The cell superposes dark lines on the star 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compare the stars ' velocities . Astronomers also need the reference lines so they can subtract the effects of Earth 's motion on the stars ' velocities . The Arizona group uses an optical device called a Fabry-Perot interferometer in place of the gas absorption cell to superpose a velocity reference upon the star 's spectrum . The use of entirely different techniques to measure radial velocity enables the astronomers to determine whether any error results from a particular observational technique . So far Marcy and his collaborators find a long-term accuracy of 20 to 25 m/s . Planned improvement in their technique should cut this error in half , enabling the detection of planets of several Jupiter masses in Jupiter-like orbits about Sun-like stars or the easy detection of Jupiter-sized bodies orbiting at Earth 's distance . But so far the group has detected no planets . McMillan 's group has observed for about 7 years , obtaining a long-term error of about 3 m/s . Although variations appear in the radial velocities of several stars owing to stellar pulsation or low-mass stellar companions , no planetary companions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of measuring a star 's velocity as it orbits its system 's center of mass , astronomers look for the displacement of a star from the center of mass . The wiggling of the star back and forth is a small effect , right at the present limit of stellar position measurements . Barnard 's star , a cool , faint star located nearby in the constellation Ophiuchus , was once thought to have two planetary companions because it showed positional , or astrometric , variations . Astronomers now believe the variations were caused by the telescope , thus evaporating hopes for the existence of planets around this star . Another search technique looks for starlight reflected by the planet . Two problems are inherent in this technique . First , Jupiter appears roughly one billion times , or 22 magnitudes , fainter than the Sun . Even for nearby stars , Jupiter-like planets would be near the limit of detectability . Second , planets in Jupiter-like orbits would appear close to the star and would be lost in the star 's glare . A planet orbiting a nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star , making such a search impossible from Earth . After astronauts install Hubble 's corrective optics in 1994 , the Space Telescope will search for the light from planets . High above the distortion caused by Earth 's atmosphere , the Space Telescope with its 0.1-arcsecond resolution could detect Jupiter-like planets ' orbiting nearby stars . Astronomers can also look for the 0.01 percent dip in the brightness of a star as an Earth-sized planet crosses , or transits , the star 's disk as seen from Earth . By chance , one planetary system out of a hundred would appear edge-on , enabling researchers to see planetary transits . So an aggressive observing program that looks at 1,000 stars per year as proposed by William Borucki of the NASA Ames Research Center might detect as many as 10 planetary systems . But so far no planets have been detected with any observing technique . Perhaps the lack of planetary detections is only a result of the short period the groups have been observing . A star with a Saturn-like body orbiting it would require 20 or 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brightness variations due to a transit would be detected . On the other hand , perhaps the lack of detections is n't a result of what is n't seen but of what is n't there . FORMING PLANETS Present ideas about star formation suggest that 60 to 80 percent of solarlike stars form in binary or multiple star systems . The remaining 20 to 40 percent are single stars . A star forms as a giant cloud , or nebula , of gas and dust contracts , heating the inner portion of the star until nuclear fires ignite . Some of the gas and dust left behind by the contracting nebula produces a disk of material that surrounds the star . Collisions between dust particles slowly build larger and larger particles , eventually forming planet-sized bodies . Indirect evidence , such as the excess of infrared emission from dust disks observed around some single stars such as Vega and Beta Pictoris ( see Indirect Evidence for Planets opposite ) , supports this accretion model of planet formation . Because the formation of nearly all single Sun-like stars produces dust disks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps the lack of planetary detections so far indicates that making Jupiter-sized bodies is more difficult than star and planet formation models suggest . Some computer simulations indicate that high-and low-density regions created in the dust disk by the accreting bodies may limit the upper size of the bodies that can form . The upper limit may in fact be the size of Jupiter . So searches for more massive bodies may prove fruitless . Present models of planetary formation also hint that the formation of a planetary system may require a Jupiter-sized body . But some evidence suggests that Jupiter-sized bodies are hard to build . The lifetime of stars twice as massive as the Sun is n't long enough to permit the completion of planets . For dust disks around stars like the Sun , simple accretion to a Jupiter-sized mass takes longer than the disk 's lifetime . So to build the planet 's core in the 10-million-year period before the disk dissipates , the core accretion must accumulate material faster as time wears on . Toward the end of the core accretion process , material must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So perhaps there are many causes for the lack of planetary detections : smaller bodies than astronomers can presently detect , fewer planetary systems with Jupiter-sized bodies , and fewer planetary systems around solarlike stars . Another clue that building small objects is n't easy comes from the brown dwarfs , which are failed stars  --  gaseous bodies with insufficient mass to ignite or sustain nuclear reactions in their cores . In size , brown dwarfs fit between the smallest stars and planets . Astronomers differentiate between brown dwarfs and planets on the basis of how they formed . Brown dwarfs form from the contraction of a gas cloud and planets form from the accretion of gas and dust around a star . By this definition , Jupiter is not a failed star , as is often stated in astronomy textbooks . But planets and brown dwarfs do have one thing in common  --  astronomers have no sure detections of either . MISSING BROWN DWARFS Star counts in our Galaxy show that low-mass stars are far more numerous than high-mass stars . Stars like the Sun are more numerous than hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Proxima Centauri ( Alpha Centauri C ) are more numerous than the Sun . The numbers of stars increase all of the way down to the lowest mass stars . The large number of low-mass stars reflects the greater chance of a gas cloud 's fragmenting into smaller clouds than its forming a massive star . The lowest mass stars have a mass only 8 percent of the Sun 's ( 80 Jupiters ) . Below this mass , the few , if any , nuclear fires inside the core are n't sufficient to prevent the body from contracting further . But if stars increase in number down to the limit of 0.08. solar mass , the formation process should create at least as many low-mass brown dwarfs . And of the binary systems containing a cool star as the more massive star , about 15 percent should include a brown dwarf . Radial-velocity searches for brown dwarfs around other stars have not detected any brown dwarf candidates . The searches extend down to 0.02 solar mass for objects with periods of 30 years or less . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10 years . A possible O.08-solar-mass object orbits Gliese 623 , but its mass suggests it 's a low-mass star and not a brown dwarf . Searches with infrared detectors ( brown dwarfs emit mostly in the infrared part of the spectrum ) also have failed to detect brown dwarfs . Perennially , several brown dwarf candidates surface , but as astronomers more accurately determine the orbit of the object or more precisely measure the object 's brightness , the candidates either increase in mass to become low-mass stars or disappear entirely , having been only an artifact in the data . So stars like LHS 2924 , VB 8B , and VB 10 have come and gone on the rolls of brown dwarf candidates . One candidate that has n't yet disappeared is GD 165B , a companion to a white dwarf , but its mass is uncertain . It might be near the 0.08-solar-mass dividing point , but so far it remains one of the best candidates . Other candidates come from the Hyades and the Pleiades , star clusters in the constellation Taurus . Previous searches with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 0.04 solar mass . Searches around white dwarfs found no brown dwarfs down to 0.03 solar mass in the Hyades and 0.0015 solar mass in the Pleiades . Infrared brightness measurements made by Claia Bryja and her colleagues at the University of Minnesota turned up 7 candidates in the Hyades . All of these objects appear around 17th magnitude and have a mass of 0.07 to 0.075 solar mass . Bryja 's brown dwarf candidates are tentative , because simple readjustments of the objects ' brightnesses could yield stellar masses for the objects . And the 0.08-solar-mass border line between stars and brown dwarfs is n't well established . It may be as low as 0.075 , or even 0.07 , solar mass . Observers and theorists will be challenged by these 7 objects until they establish the identities of these objects as brown dwarfs or low-mass stars . Meanwhile Bryja and her colleagues continue to press toward fainter objects , hoping to glimpse unshakable brown dwarf candidates with masses of 0.06 solar mass . The dearth of brown dwarfs is worrisome . There should be thousands of these objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any , brown dwarfs . Unlike planets , brown dwarfs are n't hiding in the radial velocity noise created by a star 's surface motions . Nor are their masses at the limits of detectability . The lack of detection may be more fundamental . Gas clouds may not easily form low-mass objects such as brown dwarfs . So there may be a wide chasm between those objects we call stars and the planets that form around stars . Also , searches for brown dwarfs in binary systems may be doomed because some evidence indicates binaries form through the capture of companions instead of through fragmentation of a gas cloud into two objects . Perhaps brown dwarfs do form as single objects but are not easily captured into binary systems . Whatever the reason , brown dwarfs remain as elusive as planets . Scientifically , all is not a bust . Although in many fields a lack of detection would prove worthless , here it does not mean no result . Further searches for planets and brown dwarfs , ever tightening the limits on the kinds of objects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common planets are in the universe or that our system really is unique . Either is a winner because both answers tell us about how stars and planets form and draw us a little closer to understanding the mystery of how we got here . INDIRECT EVIDENCE FOR PLANETS Direct searches for planets around other stars have yet to reveal any promising candidates . But there is indirect evidence that planetary systems may be out there . Many young stars have dust disks surrounding them . These disks appear similar to the disk from which astronomers believe our solar system formed . As many as 60 percent of young stars show evidence of a dust disk , including HL Tauri , FU Orionis , 51 Ophiuchi , DG Tauri , and L1551-IRS5 . These early disks have a mass as large as 0.01 times that of the Sun . Vega 's dust disk is twice as large as our solar system and contains particles only 1 millimeter in size . Slightly older stars , such more tenuous disks of less than one-millionth of the Sun 's mass . Beta Pictoris lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dust disk is a least 10 times larger than our solar system . A smaller gas disk lies inside the dust disk with a radius similar to the size of Mars ' orbit about the Sun . At the same time as lumpy material appears to fall into the star . Beta Pictoris itself appears to eject gas . Observations of these inflows and outflows of material may help astronomers learn how the solar system cleared itself of material after the planets formed . Dust disks evolve on a time scale of just a few million years . By about 10 million years , the disks have largely dissipated . So planet building must take place in this 10-million-year period . Spectroscopic studies also reveal the composition of the disks . HL Tauri has water-ice grains in its disk , which are perhaps similar in nature to our cometary matter . It is not clear whether all disks eventually produce planets . FU Orionis stars exhibit strong flares that may push the disk away , preventing the production of planets . But irregularities in the disk around Beta Pictoris may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
