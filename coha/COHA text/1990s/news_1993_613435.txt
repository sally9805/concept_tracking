<p> The Editors : I am extremely disturbed by a recent letter written by one of your readers from Dunwoody , referencing " intolerant Southern Baptists . " This reader refers to the many perceived " threats to freedom " posed by every single Southern Baptist on the face of the Earth . <p> This reader charges that every stand the Southern Baptists take on all of the issues he cited are wrong-minded . Many citizens who are not Southern Baptists , whether they be Catholic , Presbyterians , non- denominational or whatever , share many of the views and opinions this particular group holds on many of these issues . Those viewpoints are not always particular to any one group . <p> This reader speaks of Southern Baptists as a " biased , " " painfully intolerant " and " prejudiced " group . Perhaps the reader has a solution for groups such as this . Perhaps this reader believes that groups such as this can be " dealt with " - maybe interred in a camp of some sort . Perhaps with the proper " handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reader has taught us more about intolerance than the Southern Baptists or any other group could teach us . <p> GREG MARSHALL , Marietta <p> Damaging article on DeKalb <p> The Editors : I am writing to you regarding the very damaging article your newspaper printed approximately two months ago about DeKalb County . <p> Since the publication of your article , we have what is now considered the " kiss of death . " My home has been up for sale for one year . <p> We are in an " exclusive " area of DeKalb County and the real-estate market had just picked up after the fears of election time when your article was published . I know of six contracts that have fallen through because of your article . These people have specifically stated that your article was the reason . <p> The remarks that were made in your article could have been made about any one of the metro Atlanta counties . The people here are n't leaving DeKalb County because of " white flight . " People here are n't fleeing . <p> Your article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fail to see the point of the whole thing . Maybe if Fulton , Cobb , Rockdale and Gwinnett were investigated to the extent that you investigated DeKalb you would find that there are black areas and white areas in every county . There are good schools and bad schools in every county . People move because of the neighborhood deteriorations that occur everywhere in every county . There is bad and good reporting in every county . <p> Yes , a lot of people here have their children in private schools . They have been in private schools all of their lives , and not because of any deterioration of the public schools . We do n't care what county we live in . Our children will still attend the same private school . A great many of us send our children to Christian schools . <p> If you want to print an article , print one on the government 's interference with the schools so that we ca n't pray , or write about the garbage that is allowed to be taught . Maybe that would do some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't add more waste , please <p> The Editors : In your July 9 lead editorial titled " Council selects chaos on sewer plan " there was a reference made to a sewer separation facility . Sirs , there is no such thing . Sewer separation is a process . It is the process of running two separate lines , a line for the sewer and a separate line for stormwater . <p> I commend the members of the City Council for voting with the citizens along Utoy Creek who spent a great deal of time researching the alternatives . Separation is a far advanced technology for dealing with the sewage problem and it eliminates the overflows into the Chattahoochee rather than just reducing it , as the combined sewer overflow treatment facility would . <p> In the future , do take a minute and gather your facts before pointing a finger . This issue has far too much waste already associated with it without the media putting out more . <p> R.D. CHANAY , Atlanta <p> Nightmare in Clayton County <p> The Editors : The Olympics in Clayton County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road ! It sounds like a nightmare . <p> The " water park " in Jonesboro that wants to host the beach volleyball event is being expanded constantly over the protests of hundreds of nearby homeowners . <p> This " water park " is an eyesore and creates incredible traffic problems on weekends . Liquor is allowed to be brought into the park if it is concealed , traffic laws are disregarded and the noise of the customers is a constant problem for those whose property borders the " park . " Police helicopters have been known to circle the park for unknown reasons , and now Walt Stephens Road is adorned with " No Parking " signs . <p> The commissioners approved this " park " over homeowners ' objections and now the " park " wants to host 40,000 people . How ? Should we be prepared to see Walt Stephens Road turned into a four-lane highway ? I can not believe the quest to make money is being heard over the legitimate concerns of thousands of citizens . What started life as a nondescript neighborhood lake has escalated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-carts , baseball fields , ad infinitum . <p> I am excited about the Olympics coming to Atlanta , but this is a zoning error that just keeps accelerating . It is time to stop it . <p> JUDY SERRITELLA , Jonesboro <p> Use prisoners as guinea pigs <p> The Editors : Why are we using animals for experiments when there are so many prisoners on death row ? Let them contribute something to society . <p> Instead of using animals to experiment on , using prisoners would help us to find cures much faster . <p> T. DAVIS , Atlanta <p> Good neighbors When crisis hit , Delta was ready <p> The Editors : Let me set the scene . About a half-hour out of Atlanta . Delta Flight 15 from Frankfort . Final destination , St. Louis . <p> My sister had gone to the restroom and when she did n't return , I went in search . I found her with several flight attendants giving her oxygen and loosening her clothing in order to help her breathe . <p> They called a doctor . Two came . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta . They took her - and me - to South Fulton Hospital . <p> Delta assigned a young man to stay by my side to help . Delta contacted my sister 's daughter , who was waiting for us at the airport , to tell her what had happened . She almost beat us to the hospital ! <p> I am not sure , but I think that Delta arranged to have a " pulmonary " doctor in the emergency room . <p> Delta took care of our luggage , my hotel room and the cab to get to the hotel - certainly beyond the call of duty ! <p> Please convey our thanks to the crew of Flight 15 . They were wonderful . So was Bob Ellis , who watched over me . He is a gem . <p> And our thanks for the fast footwork at the hospital . They were all just great ! And to the people of Atlanta , they are so nice ! <p> MARTHA HARRIS , Mount Vernon , Ill . <p> She took the time to help <p> The Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas gauge stuck on my rental car and I ran out of gas . I had my eight-month old baby and teacup poodle in the car . <p> While walking down the interstate a car being driven by Jennie Glasgow , of Jenco Enterprises , an advertising and public relations firm in Atlanta , stopped . <p> Jennie 's demeanor was such that I felt comfortable getting in the car with her . She took me to the nearest gas station and told me to sit in the car and comfort my baby while she took care of me . After getting a full gas can , driving me back to my car and assisting me with filling the car , she then followed me back to the station to make sure I arrived safely . <p> Jennie was en route to teach a railroad crossing safety seminar to law-enforcement individuals when she took time to help . <p> Thank you , Jennie Glasgow . <p> KAREN BARRON , Knoxville , Tenn.
