Special Report , Part 2 <p> Detroit may be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel . Throughout the ' 80s American automakers struggled to keep up with their Japanese competitors . Now it seems as if Detroit car makers are on track and ready to put the troubles of the past behind . <p> The strategy of the past few years is continued for 1993 with focus on improving customer service , safety , and quality . To do this , the car makers have devised service strategies to back up their quality claims . They are also attempting to improve the value of cars by restraining prices and moving technologies-such as anti-lock brakes-developed for premium lines down through the product line quickly . <p> In addition to minor refinements , Detroit has continued to update and replace older models with complete makeovers , such as the Ford Probe and the Geo Metro . Also , this year Chrysler makes its bid for the future of the full-size car market with the unveiling of its LH line . <p> The following outlines some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fall the Chrysler Corporation is introducing its LH line - the Chrysler Concorde , Dodge Intrepid , and Eagle Vision . The line is virtually all-new , intended to serve as the company flagships in the years to come . By pulling the passenger cabin forward and pushing the rear wheels back in what is known as a " cab forward " design , engineers have created a relatively long wheelbase . This should produce a more stable ride and better handling , according to Chrysler . <p> The standard 3.3 liter V-6 hauls these sedans from 0-60 in 11 seconds . For those who want some extra spunk when they drive , an optional 3.5 liter V-6 engine , developed specifically for the LH , drops that time to 8.8 seconds , according to Chrysler . Of course , the new design incorporates safety features that Chrysler has been promoting for the past few years , such as driver and passenger air bags and the fold-down child safety seat introduced in Chrysler 's minivans last year . The cars also have standard or optional anti-lock braking and traction control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many industry analysts view the LH models as Chrysler 's chance to return as a force in the passenger car market . So far reviews on the LH are good . In an assessment for Motor magazine , Tom Wilkinson writes , " Poor quality is the only thing that can sink this car .... From a technical standpoint the Concorde , Intrepid and Vision look like winners . " <p> Elsewhere in the Chrysler lineup , the minivan trio-Dodge Caravan , Plymouth Voyager , and Chrysler Town &; Country-receives modest optional improvements , including a new powertrain cooling system to make the vans run smoother under hill-climbing and towing conditions and a sport suspension package to improve road feel . <p> Dodge/Plymouth . The Colt coupe and sedan receive a makeover for 1993 . Interior space was added by making both models longer and wider and using a new uni-body frame , according to the manufacturer . Antilock brakes are now offered as an option on four-door models . <p> Also at Dodge , the super-muscle-car Viper was introduced this spring , but its hand-built manufacturing will keep prospective buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jeep/Eagle . The Summit receives the same makeover as its sibling , the Colt . The redone Jeep Grand Cherokee , introduced this past spring , offers an optional 5.2 liter V-8 with 30 more horse-power than the standard 190-hp , 4.0 liter I-6 motor . The added power boosts its towing capacity 1,500 pounds for a total of 5,000 pounds . In midyear , Jeep intends to introduce a two-wheel drive version in the base and Laredo Cherokee models . Ford <p> The upscale Ford Crown Victoria , Lincoln Town Car , and Lincoln Continental offer a new voice-activated cellular telephone . After tapping a button to turn on the phone , the driver simply says the person 's name whom he wishes to call ; the telephone then dials the appropriate number , according to Ford . To help drivers uncomfortable with electronic technology program their phones , Ford offers a telephone hotline . <p> The Probe , Ford 's sporty coupe , has been reengineered with a " cab forward " design that lengthens the wheelbase by four inches . The GT version sports a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 24-valve , 2.5 liter engine produces 164 hp and carries the coupe from 0 to 60 in 7.0 seconds , according to a recent Car and Driver . The base model uses a new 2.0 liter , 16-valve , four-cylinder engine that produces 115 hp . The engines are complemented by an improved suspension . Both models have driver-side air bags and an optional anti-lock braking system . <p> In an attempt to lure value-conscious consumers , Ford will continue its " one price " plan on Escorts . ( All Escort body styles with a standard option package sell for the same price . ) Other models have minor mechanical refinements , such as an optional automatic transmission for the Taurus SHO and a new headliner in the Mustang convertible . <p> Lincoln-Mercury . In the general drive toward greater safety , the Mercury Grand Marquis and Sable offer passenger-side air bags as standard equipment this year . <p> The Lincoln Town Car has a new grill and taillamps to spruce up its looks . Both driver and passenger air bags and anti-lock braking systems are standard . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front instead of the traditional bench seat . <p> The new Lincoln Mark VIII is slated to be introduced in December and will have an advanced 4.6 liter , 32-valve V-8 and computercontrolled , air-spring suspension . The new engine combines economy and performance by running on two valves per cylinder under normal conditions and only opening up all four when in need of additional power . <p> New at Mercury is the Villager minivan . The van is powered by a 3.0 liter V-6 that , when combined with an optional towing package , can pull 3,500 pounds . It also has standard anti-lock brakes . General Motors <p> General Motors seems to be concentrating on customer satisfaction this year with three of its divisions , Buick , Oldsmobile , and Pontiac , placing a heavy emphasis on service programs .

The biggest news at Buick was the development of a new seat designed to be more comfortable for a wider range of people . Buick officials claim the seat , which will be used in their Regal model , is particularly comfortable on long trips , because it " distributes body pressure evenly across the cushion , puts the lumbar in the proper position , and gives the customer shoulder blade contact with the seat . " <p> For more convenient servicing , Buick will offer courtesy transportation for drivers while their cars are in for repair under its 3 year/ 30,000 mile warranty . <p> Elsewhere in the Buick line , refinements to the 3.8 liter V-6 , which is standard in the Park Avenue , LeSabre , and Regal Grand Sport , improve fuel economy , emissions , and performance , according to the manufacturer . <p> Cadillac . The Fleetwood has a new body for 1993 that is four inches longer and has 18 more cubic feet of interior space including a trunk with 20.8 cubic feet capacity . Despite its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from .49 coefficient of drag to .36 , that should help offset any loss of fuel mileage from its increased size . The new model also is equipped with a traction control system to reduce wheel spin in slippery conditions . <p> The Northstar 4.6 liter , 32-valve V-8 and electronic transmission introduced with the Allante earlier this year is now available in the Seville Touring Sedan and Eldorado Touring Coupe . <p> The company touts the fact that the Fleetwood , Seville , and Eldorado all feature both driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment and , along with the Allante , meet 1997 Federal Side Impact Standards four years ahead of schedule . All 1993 Cadillacs feature a variable power steering that contributes more aid at low speeds and less at higher , giving the driver a better feel for the road at high speeds , according to Cadillac . <p> Chevrolet/Geo . Most of the action at Chevrolet/Geo involves restraining or reducing prices . Both the Cavalier and the Metro have reduced prices from last year and the mid-size Lumina retains last year 's list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extended by two inches and the car is now considered a compact . Combined with an extra inch of width , the new Prizm has more head , leg , and shoulder room than its predecessor . Additional insulation and doors that wrap into the roofline make for a quieter ride , according to Geo . <p> The Corvette marks its 40th birthday with the predictable special appearance package . Its optional , high-performance , ZR-l package has been refined so that it offers 30 more horsepower than last year . On the safety front , the Beretta and Corsica both add a brake-transmission interlock to all their automatic transmission models . <p> Oldsmobile . Oldsmobile 's efforts for 1993 focus on refining its " Oldsmobile Edge " customer satisfaction drive . The program includes a trade-in program , similar to that at Saturn , where a dissatisfied owner can trade in his new Olds for credit towards a replacement for up to 30 days after the original purchase . Oldsmobile also offers roadside assistance for breakdowns and courtesy transportation for repair work . <p> Oldsmobile also offers antilock brakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oldsmobile 's minivan , the Silhouette , is now offered with an optional power-operated sliding side door that can be operated from the driver 's seat .

Pontiac has its own customer satisfaction program called " Pontiac Cares . " It provides new Pontiac owners with roadside assistance , courtesy transportation , and a toll-free assistance hotline . <p> As at Chevrolet , Pontiac features lowered or maintained prices on selected automobiles , including various Sunbird and Grand Prix models . <p> The Trans Sport , a minivan , is fitted with a new " quiet package " for 1993 . The company says the package , which includes thicker glass and better fender seals , makes the van one of the quietest on the market .
