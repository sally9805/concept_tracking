Ella Fitzgerald sang , " I got it bad and that ai n't good . " She was referring to love , of course . But somehow that lyric always comes to mind when I think about individuals who have been bitten by the collecting bug , not struck by an arrow from Cupid 's bow . With George and Dorothy Saxe , whose collection is honored in " The Art of Craft , " an important exhibition at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco ( through October 17 ) , the first " bites " came in rapid succession . In 1979 , Dorothy Saxe saw a Toronto gallery show of work by the glass artist Mark Peiser . Soon after , the Saxes saw the catalogue for the Corning Museum of Glass exhibition " New Glass : A Worldwide Survey , " and that made a strong impression on George . Before they were able to view the actual exhibit , they saw the touring version of " Americans in Glass 1978 " at the Oakland Museum . They were off and running-that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired over 150 pieces of contemporary studio glass.1 From an early stage , the Saxes were open about their desire to help gain museum recognition for what they describe as " art made with craft materials . " In 1986 , their glass collection was featured atthe Oakland Museum . By the time " Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection " appeared at the Toledo Museum of Art in 1993 , they had expanded beyond glass to clay , wood , fiber and metal . That exhibition led to a gift to the host museum of 63 works , 57 in glass.2 Now , only six years later , the Saxe Collection is back , in an exhibition of 223 works by 132 artists that heralds a promised bequest of more than 600 objects.3 There will be a gallery named for the Saxes and dedicated to their collection in the Fine Arts Museums ' new M. H. de Young Memorial Museum building now being designed by the Swiss architectural firm of Herzog &; de Meuron . The couple have also created an endowment to support further purchases . In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the Saxes have also long been known for their generous support with both time and money of craft-related organizations such as the Pilchuck Glass School , the Glass Art Society , the California College of Arts and Crafts and the American Craft Council . They have always said their collection would go to a museum . Yet there is still something extraordinary about their action . What can one say about collectors who could , and did , donate one of Bertil Vallien 's large glass boats to one museum , and then acquire and donate another , all within a single decade ? And that is just a small part of what they have done . If Ella had been singing about collecting , and in particular Dorothy and George Saxe , she might have sung , " You got it bad and that sure is good . " The Saxes " extraordinary generosity is certain to prove of immeasurable benefit to the museum and the community . Meanwhile the exhibition offers a revealing look at the craft world over the past two decades , and a guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about George and Dorothy Saxe was when someone told me about some San Francisco glass collectors who had Richard Marquis create a new piece from the fragments left after the earthquake of 1989 destroyed many works in their collection . 7.1 , 1991 , named afterthe measurement of the quake on the Richter scale , is on display near the entrance to the exhibition , and it is as good an emblem as any of the Saxe spirit . Glass collecting in San Francisco-that 's crazy love . Turning a smashup into art with the help of a friend-that 's the Saxes . Also on view right at the start is a Ginny Ruffner commissioned piece , 1991 , that incorporates such San Francisco icons as a 49ers helmet , the Golden Gate Bridge and a heart ( for Tony Bennett ) . It is a good-humored tribute that reflects the devotion to the Bay Area shown in the Saxes ' gift to the museum . It is also a reminder that the Saxes have always had a special fondness for West Coast artists-Ruffner lives in Seattle-which in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region has been such a craft stronghold . The Saxes built a museum-quality collection , and now it is in a museum . The collection has such scope , depth and quality that it could provide several museums with the works necessary for a fine introduction to contemporary craft . Gaps do remain and presumably will be filled using the Saxe endowment and other museum funds . The Saxes have already been engaged in a conscientious effort at upgrading , as in the recent purchase of a major Robert Arneson , A Hollow Jesture , 1971 , that adds an exclamation point to two Arnesons obtained before the artist 's death in 1992 . Until that Arneson acquisition , the Saxes generally purchased only new work by living artists . That may explain why , for example , there is only one piece , from 1981 , by Dominick Labino , who died in 1987-but it is a beauty , a delicate dream in glass . Even as they moved toward the bequest , the Saxes made important purchases to bolster their holdings : the crowd-pleasing Still Life , 1997 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxe favorites and friends Joey Kirkpatrick and Flora Mace ; Yogi , 1997 , a powerhouse Peter Voulkos that complements a 1980 stack piece ; and a Betty Woodman venture into glass , 1993-96 , fabricated by the great Lino Tagliapietra and forming an ensemble with several equally fine Woodman ceramic pieces . Glass remains the heart of the collection . The opening gallery is a sampler of works in all media that is engaging in spite of being a bit of a jumble . But the next gallery , devoted entirely to glass , is a spectacular demonstration of installation design and lighting that gets the exhibition firmly on track . From a Peiser by the entrance to a group of absolute top-drawer William Morris works from the past decade at the far end , and then on into other galleries ( Dale Chihuly is given his own room ) , the Saxe glass holdings appear as one impressive example after another , in a roll call of important figures from Adams to Zynsky , with Ben Tre , Huchthausen , Kuhn , Lipofsky , Littleton , Moje , Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent acquisition , a Tagliapietra , is glass to the nth degree , classic Venetian technique in a lovely arabesque-using colors suggested by George Saxe .

Photograph // Many collectors practice a kind of checklist-and **25;1063;TOOLONG , using a major exhibition catalogue or standard history book as a guide to be strictly followed . Others exercise willful indifference to the conventional wisdom and follow their own highly personal , even idiosyncratic preferences . When the Saxes began collecting glass , they earned a reputation for tirelessly visiting exhibitions , galleries , studios . They have always tried to reserve judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they liked , not just filling slots . Still , the influence of Pilchuck and certain American dealers seems evident in what the Saxes have been exposed to , as in the strong examples in the collection by Bertil Vallien and Ann Wolff from Sweden , and a Czech contingent led by Jaroslava Brychtova and Stanislav Libensky . For whatever reason , the Saxes have acquired no Finnish glass , to take one foreign example . Among Americans , notable absences include Benjamin Moore and Paul Marioni , two individuals from among those who were in that long-ago Corning exhibit . The same issue of selection and omission arises in the other areas . The Saxes have created formidable ceramic and wood collections . The 16 Bob Stocksdale turned-wood bowls in the exhibit make it easy to understand why George Saxe-in this case , the one primarily responsible for the purchases-is apparently smitten with collectivitis every time he sees one for sale ( there are 20 more in the bequest ) . The selections from other turners , such as Melvin Lindquist and Michael Shuler , and from furniture makers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the quality of the work is once again outstanding , although there the sense is even stronger that the usual suspects are being rounded up , with Arneson and Voulkos joined by-and this is only a partial list-Autio , Karnes , De Staebler , Soldner , Duckworth , Turner , Higby , Earl , Kaneko , Frey , Price , Nagle and , an eye-opener for me , the late Daniel Rhodes . Compared to the glass or ceramics , the Saxe fiber collection is very much a work in progress . It includes fine examples by important figures such as Lia Cook and a lovely set of works by Kay Sekimachi that seems equivalent to the Stocksdale group as an expression of sheer joy in an artist . Overall , however , the fiber pieces are lower keyed than the works in other media . The placement of an Olga de Amaral behind the Voulkos pieces and a Cynthia Schira behind the Karnes and a Price establishes a perfect visual harmony but risks having the fiber pieces appear like the old art world joke in reverse , as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Saxe Collection encompasses both quietly elegant work and bolder , even brash pieces : a classic Sam Maloof rocker and a cartoony john Cederquist chest of drawers ; Tom Patti 's geometrical abstractions and Dan Dailey 's witty figuration ; a purist Richard DeVore vessel and a punkish Michael Lucero self-portrait . The Saxe enthusiasm for different media and different styles seems appropriate for collectors decisively shaped by the early 8os , when the varied approaches to be found in studio glass ( and other craft media ) could all seem fresh and exciting and part ofa broad movement . In that respect , the inclusion of works by Larry Bell and Christopher Wilmarth ( who died in 1987 ) has a kind of inevitability , with those two figures once again playing their familiar role as artists outside the studio glass movement who use glass . Their inclusion always strikes me as problematic , a Trojan horse , because it invokes a larger art world that can neither be ignored nor convincingly addressed . A new version of that old situation arises with an untitled 1993 work by Kiki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a benefit auction . A wall piece featuring small silhouetted figures in gold leaf , many connected by red lines in a kind of diagram , it uses Nepal paper and Thai tissue and is therefore classified as " fiber . " Dimly lit for conservationist reasons , for me it nevertheless stood out as the key work in the exhibition . The exhibition 's curator , Timothy Burgard , who is the Ednah Root Curator of American Art for the Fine Arts Museums , provides an excellent analysis of the work in his catalogue essay and acknowledges its special status when he says , " Kiki Smith is representative of a growing number of artists who perceive their choice and use of multiple media as the formal means to an expressive end , not as an affirmation of art or craft identities . " I agree , and I also believe he is correct when he suggests that the distinction between art and craft will prove increasingly difficult to maintain . The Saxes discovered studio glass at an opportune time , when it appeared as an undiscovered , artistically rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true believers-artists , collectors , dealers , curators , critics-came together with a great sense of camaraderie . Many shared the goal of overcoming philistine denigrators of craft and entering a promised land flowing with status and money , or at least respect . Acceptance by fine art museums would be the sign of arrival . When the Saxes came on the scene , functionalism was already disappearing as a concern in some quarters . Figures such as Voulkos and Littleton had already moved to gallery vessels and " sculptural " work . That makes the art-craft dichotomy less of a problem than usual with respect to the collection , especialy since the Saxes did not try to acquire early works , and have shied away from functional pieces . The collection as it now stands , with almost all works from after 1980 and only a few works by contemporary artists from non-craft backgrounds , is perhaps best viewed as an extraordinary encapsulation of an important transitional period . And that was apparently part of the intention . In 1987 , when the Saxes had started to shift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Morris , they remarked that they hoped their collection would be a record of the 1980s .

Without denying the artistry of the wood turners , it seems safe to say that an exhibition of such work at a major contemporary art museum would be a curiosity-tokenism , or a transparent attempt to put on a populist front ( or maybe please a trustee collector ) . Chihuly is contemporary and he 's an artist , but for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not belong to-I am not saying " in " - the contemporary art world in the same way as Kiki Smith ( who did a major installation at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art that incorporated glasswork fabricated in Murano ) or Ann Hamilton ( who started as a fiber artist ) . Chihuly has " done " Venice-but not , like Hamilton , as the American representative to the Biennale this year . The gift of the Saxe Collection may well mark a new accommodation of " studio crafts " within the art world , or at least within art history and museums with historical collections . Exactly how studio craft works will be integrated within museums remains the $64,000 question , and one that in the specific case of the Saxe Collection will not be answered decisively until the new building is opened-if then . There is always the danger that studio craft works will become mere decorative accessories or " accents " in the history of 20th-century art . Yet large , bold works like the Voulkos Yogi , Brychtova , and Libensky 's Flowering Throne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bids adieu to visitors at the exit to the exhibition , are unlikely to play only supporting roles . The smaller-scale works such as the Stocksdales and Sekimachis should also hold their own , precisely because of what might be described in advertising lingo as concentrated , extra-strength beauty . All the same , shifting from traditional notions of fine arts and crafts , or studio crafts , to the less hierarchical , less compartmentalized approach to cultural forms and cultural history Burgard advocates in his catalogue essay will not be easy . The categories are not just linguistic . They are in effect socially and institutionally " built-in " and may prove difficult to escape even in a new , more flexible space . To finesse the art-craft issue in an exhibition title is one thing ; solving the problem in a comprehensive museum presentation is another . It is reassuring that the gift agreement makes it possible for works from the Saxe Collection to be shown throughout the museum , not only in the Saxe Gallery , and for works from other museum collections to be shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the kind of flexibility that will make it possible to rethink , not just repackage , the relationship between fine art and craft.4 The Saxes have at once presented a challenge and the resources-artistic and financial-to help meet it . The exhibi tion is a well-deserved tribute to conscientious collecting and enlightened patronage . I would n't be surprised at all if it were responsible for a new outbreak of the collecting " bug " in the Bay Area . Let 's just hope that Dr. Marquis does n't have to make any more house calls . Footnote 1 . Their first purchase was a small Dale Chihuly piece , which they candidly admit was acquired as a decorative accessory . 2 . The history ofthe Saxe Collection is presented in the catalogue for the Totedo exhibition , which also includes excellent essays on the history of collection in individual craft media . The curator for the current exhibition , Timothy Burgard , wisely decided to do something altogether different , and surprisingly rare : write about the works of art , specifically , those by Chihuly , Vallien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cederquist and Smith . The discussions are in general excellent , as when he rightly emphasizes the countercultural background of Chihuly and Pilchuck in the early days . He understandably is less forthcoming about Chihuly 's more recent work and its cultural significance , although it is not hard to guess whom he is speaking about when in his brief conclusion he expresses concern about the current effects of the cult of personality . 3 . Dorothy Saxe has retained possession of her " art jewelry " collection , some of which was exhibited in the Toledo exhibition . The metal collection on display in " The Art of Craft " appears rather perfunctory , though it contains appealing works by Judy Kensley McKie and Manuel Neri. 4. 1 would like to express my gratitude to Timothy Burgard for his kindness in answering innumerable questions , and my faith in his ability to help make sure that the Saxe Collection is used wisely and well .
