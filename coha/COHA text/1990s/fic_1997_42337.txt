In October 1992 , a year before the fire that incinerated his house , Spear telephoned Jennifer in San Francisco to inquire about her Christmas plans . <p> " What 's up , Grandpa ? " Jennifer 's voice , Dietrich-rough in the lower register , hearing his , rose , Spear thought with pleasure , rather than alarm , " You all right ? " <p> " As rain . Thinking about Christmas , if you had plans . " " Plans ? " <p> " St. Louis ? Tahiti ? Wherever ? " " Ca n't afford it . " <p> A surprise . Unlike her grandfather , Jennifer never complained about money . He did n't know what she made , had never asked , but in her third year as an associate with Schmidt , Barczyk and Cole , she must be doing pretty well . She had an apartment ten floors up on Filbert and Hyde , nice clothes , and a Riviera , spiffier than any car he 'd owned . <p> " Did you make a bad investment ? Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> A pause in which Spear felt a gear shift in his breath and pulse . " Not really , Grandpa . " <p> Alone in the Malibu Canyon cabin , Spear felt himself reaching through the wires for his granddaughter 's mild , thoughtful face , the face that somehow validated his life . " Can you tell me ? " <p> " Not exactly trouble . " The voice was rougher now . " I do n't have a job . " <p> Now Spear could n't speak , then , " You resigned ? " " They fired me . " <p> " No . How could they ? " The words felt like lead , he could hardly hoist them from his throat . " Y-you were doing w-wonderfully . How could they ? " <p> " Did n't seem too difficult for them . " " Did something happen ? An argument ? " " The recession happened . " <p> " Yes , but for lawyers ? " Spear put his hand around a glass of Scotch he 'd poured for the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our building alone , fifty lawyers , at least . With us , only the associates ; the nine of us who came three years ago are all out . " <p> Spear stuttered with the stutter that had almost miraculously disappeared when he 'd gone up to Oxford , forty years ago . " W-wwhat exactly h-happened ? " <p> " You know those environmental cases I worked on ? Modesto Insurance . Our-their ! - biggest client . It dropped us . Them . " <p> " N-not because of you ? " <p> " I hope not . " <p> " How long  --  w-when was this ? " <p> " They dropped us in April . I was fired in June . " <p> Spear put down the glass and counted on his fingers . " Four months . " <p> " Is that it ? I got three months ' separation pay . In a way , it 's been grand . I took that trip to Glacier Park . " <p> " I remember . But you did n't tell me what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I told anyone . " <p> " You were dear to s-spare-w-when there's- When you 're in trouble , I w-want to know . " <p> Even as he said this , Spear felt a dizzying whiff of fear . For Jennifer , for himself . He saw her in the air falling : this wonderful person to whom , by the mysteries of desire and protein , he was indissolubly connected . Her security was a crucial part of his . It was he who 'd encouraged her to go east to school , then west to law school . ( He 'd paid for a part of both . ) When she passed the bar at her first try , then got a job with Schmidt , Barczyk and Cole he 'd felt more pride and joy than for anything he 'd ever done on his own . When he saw her name cut in black letters-Ms . Abarbanel-on the brass plate outside her cubicle on the twenty-third floor of 2 Embarcadero Center , he 'd told himself that he had finally arrived . This was the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American establishment . <p> And now , out of the awful blue , nothing . <p> Twenty years of school , every sort of special training , and here she was , this achievement of all that , the flower of the Spears , his darling granddaughter , dropping into emptiness . <p> He managed , " I 'm here for you , Fer . This place is here for you . Y-you can look for j-jobs down here . I 'll speak to Ez Keneret . He knows plenty of l-lawyers . Ira Stein , one of the biggest . They 'll die to get a brilliant young woman like you . " <p> " Grandpa , Grandpa . " <p> Spear was n't quite sure what he 'd said . Was it too much ? Was he interfering , the way her mother interfered ? Benevolent smothering . " Forgive , I 'm just d-digesting the news . But Fer , I do have ssome people I can call . " <p> " Thank you , Grandpa . I am having interviews . It 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got out his checkbook . He had to show her he was there for her . Five hundred ? No , that was no longer a significant sum . A thousand ? That 's what he gave her for Christmas . This had to be special . Two thousand ? Twenty-five hundred ? He could n't keep sending that-unless it was deductible , but this was a time for a declaration , a sign that something solid was there for her . <p> He wrote out the four figures , subtracted it from his careful balance and put it in an envelope with a short letter : " Fer , dear-a few dollars to make me feel that I can help a little-Love , Grandpa . " He walked it out to the road , stuck it in his mailbox and raised its red tin flag . He felt grand , a bit , he thought , the way astronauts might feel when the booster drops away and their capsule heads into orbit . <p> After Jack Cole told her that they 'd lost Modesto Insurance and two other clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , phone in lap , pressing number buttons , then Disconnect over and over , calling , then not calling , friends , parents , Grandpa . Then she packed up and walked home down Clay , Montgomery , and Columbus , an hour 's good walk , clearing her head . <p> Home , she opened her best bottle of wine , a 1985 Bordeaux , poured it into her tallest , prettiest wine glass , turned out the lights , and sat by the window overlooking the Bay Bridge . Liquid on her tongue and in her throat , fingering the gold rim , feeling her flannel pjs on her breasts , the leather upholstery on her bottom , she took in the night lights popping on in the city . Still hers . Her apartment . Her chair . Her self . <p> That first hour , she 'd hated Jack Cole , as she could n't remember hating anyone in her life . The frigid , phony sympathy of the ex-lover hatchet man drilled a new emotional well in her system . Out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fax , the phone , the printer , the Mac , the monitor , the casebooks , the law , business , California . She 'd poured her mind , energy , hopes , and time down an electronic void . Jack 's forehead wrinkling into his stupid crew cut , his snub nose with the big nostrils , his bulldog 's absurd jaw . She hated him , yet , yet , telling her was not a picnic for him . Firing her did n't give him pleasure . And it was better than finding a letter from him or the managing partner in her pay envelope . Not even hatred was easy . <p> Three years of-if not praise , approval . No associate in a good law firm expected more than that . Money was your praise . And it was a lot more money than she 'd ever had . <p> Now she went through what she did have : three CD.s ( two for five , one for eight thousand ) , six thousand in her Bank of America checking account , two Vanguard funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-what ? - eight months ? ten ? Better : she 'd be getting twelve weeks ' separation pay ; and there was Unemployment , however much that was . Sitting-more or less-pretty . <p> Car lights drilled the bridge ; below , the jangle of the cable car . Fer in Frisco , all 's almost right with the world . <p> Tomorrow-every day-she could sleep as long as she wanted . She could bike , shop , walk , read novels , drink hot chocolate in Ghiradelli Square , go to the Cineplex ; she could meet non-lawyers , have dates . ( That old word ; Mama 's generation . But she could not tell Mama , or she 'd be out here with a van , trying to pack her up , take her back to St. Louis . ) Maybe she 'd drive up the coast to Olympia Park ; or take a cruise . That 's how you met people , was n't it ? Handsome companions in white pants on white boats . Or Paris . Rome . They might be deductible : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first time in a long time . <p> No more depositional battles , jurisdictional confrontations , hair-splitting debates about responsibility for poisoning what was left of the livable earth . No more dragging her bones home at midnight and forcing them out of bed at quarter of six , showering in thirty seconds , gobbling a stale croissant as she ran downhill to catch the bus . No more of the tension that constipated her for weeks . <p> She 'd take care of herself , sleep half the day , cook up a storm , play tennis at the Alice Marble courts she could see from her window , but where she 'd played maybe twice in three years . Then , at her leisure , when she felt like it , she 'd glance at the ads in the trades . <p> By the time she told her grandfather , four moths later , Jennifer had had two interviews , one with the brother of a girl she 'd met in Glacier Park , a fundraiser for the Episcopal Church , the second with the uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in San Jose and was thinking of taking on inhouse counsel . She was asked back for second rounds of interviews , but not only did the jobs pay much less than what she 'd earned at Schmidt , Barczyk and Cole , they did n't interest her . Maybe she was n't ready to be interested . Leisure was still deeply pleasant ; and she still had money . <p> Yet a week after she 'd refused the second invitation to San Jose , the flutters of panic she 'd felt intermittently since April steadied into a low stream of tension . Cycling , shopping , reading , going to dinner , the movies , or even to bed with one of the wandering men she ran into here and there , she felt head and stomach aches , which , she realized after she 'd slept through them , rose from the panic stream . <p> Grandpa 's check diverted the stream , but then deepened it . For three years , she 'd earned as much , maybe more , money than he , or , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in itself , and what it did for her sense that she 'd broken from the cocoon of dependence . The very generosity of the check panicked her . <p> Ten days after it arrived , she went down to the State Building on Turk Street and filled out the form for unemployment compensation . The contemptuous ugliness of the rooms and corridors almost drove her away , but the elderly black woman who interviewed her " What sort of position are you looking for , Ms. Abarbanel ? " - was so gentle and sympathetic that she made acceptance of state money seem a patriotic act . <p> Every two weeks then a check for $467 arrived in an official envelope . ( If another tenant was at the lobby mailbox , Jennifer concealed it . Why upset fellow tenants with what they paid good money to hide from ? ) The day she got her second check , she rewrote her resume and sent it out with a hundred and fifty computergenerated letters of inquiry to which , over the next month , she received sixty-five answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two were for in-house counsel , one in San Rafael , the other with an educational testing service in Palo Alto . She went back to Palo Alto for a second round of interviews and was considering their offer-despite a salary half what she 'd made at SB &C-when; the vice-president , an amusing , gray-haired man with his wife and childrens ' pictures covering his walls , asked her if she 'd go with him to a jazz concert in Monterey . <p> The third letter was from Angela Persill , another SB &C; firee . Angela was starting a practice with a few lawyers , " None over forty . Specializing in employment rights . Down our alley , Jen . " Each lawyer had to put in twenty thousand dollars for start-up costs . <p> " That lets me out , " said Jennifer . <p> " Borrow . Take our prospectus to the bank , I do n't think you 'll have a problem . " <p> " Except for law school , I 've never borrowed anything . Even borrowing from family threw me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Look here , Jen , I 'm scared too . I 've got more to lose than you . It makes it exciting . " <p> " I 'm no good with risk , Angela . Probably the way I grew up , under the suburban god Security . " Also , she did n't like being called Jen . She hardly knew Angela : they 'd done one deposition together , just enough to let her see that pale , frail Angela was one tough cookie . " I 'm just not entrepreneurial . " <p> " You do n't have to be . I am . I 'm sure we 'll work well together , like we did on that depo . I need a first-rate woman . We got two guys on board , one you know , Sid McSharoy . " A bald , bright-eyed fellow Jennifer danced with at SB &C; Christmas parties . " Rain-makers . But they make me uneasy ; I do n't want to get too male-heavy . " <p> " I would counter that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I want . I 'm so sure , I 'll cover you for five , six thousand . If you can come up with the rest . " A pause . " Am I pushing too hard ? " <p> One hundred forty-seven doors had slammed in Jennifer 's face . Angela 's need for her , for her ability , as well as her gender , felt good . Ten o'clock , a weekday October morning , she was still in her pajamas ; Angela had probably been up since six . " I appreciate this , Angela . The confidence . I 've been losing mine . Can you let me think it out a while ? " <p> " Ab-so-lute-ly . Take two-three days . I 'll hold off . You did a hell of a job on that depo , Jen . " <p> " You had to straighten me out a few times . " <p> " You were good . " <p> " But if I come in , I come in like everybody . I can get the money . " <p> Lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't join Angela : even on the phone , she made her tense . Knowing this , though , she felt hollow . <p> Hollow was how Spear felt many times in the weeks after that first call . In subsequent ones , Jennifer sounded , perhaps was , cheerful , but whatever else they talked about , he thought of little else but her situation . He always got around to it . " Anything on the horizon , dear ? " <p> " A few things , Grandpa . Nothing sensational . " <p> " I spoke to Ez , and to Zack Wool . They 'll ask around . Ira Stein said he 'd be glad to talk with you when you come down to LA . " <p> " That 's nice , Grandpa . Thank you . " <p> " I still do n't get it . The market ' s in good shape . I 'm worth more each month , at least on paper . What 's going on ? " <p> " You must only read the Arts and Feature sections . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Check out Page One . You 'll see reductions in force , downsizings , bases closing , plants closing . The end of the Cold War has n't been too great for California . " <p> " So that makes you a casualty . Which makes me one . " <p> " No , Grandpa , neither you nor I. I 'm fine , and you too . " <p> He sent her another check , for a thousand dollars . " Dear Grandpa , " she wrote back , <p> I 'm so grateful for the check , and I 'm going to accept it as your Christmas gift . You must n't send any more . If I need money , I 'll ask . <p> There are jobs out there , I 've just been finicky . I probably picked places I knew could n't use me . I 'll be buckling down real soon . Meanwhile , your generous check will pay much of my December rent . <p> I have n't decided anything about Xmas . If I go home , there 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates California . She has nightmares of me falling into boiling lava ! ! <p> I did finally tell her what was going on . After the first shock , she sounded happy . " Now you can come home . " She told me last week she 'd contacted eighteen lawyers , all of whom agreed to see me . Agreed ! ! They 'd probably give a thousand dollars to get her off the phone . <p> Maybe , in a week or two , we can talk about Xmas . At the moment , except for your check , I do n't have much Christmas spirit . I do n't suppose you want to go to St. Louis . <p> In any case , I 'll be fine by myself . Much love and XXX , Fer <p> No , he would not be going to St. Louis . <p> A few years ago , something-he did n't know what-had happened in his relations with his daughter . <p> Intelligent , generous , helpful , loving , Amelia had been an almost perfect daughter , and remained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd become a conservative , and they 'd had some unjocular discussions about Nixon and Ford . He remembered his annoyance that she did n't get facts right , did n't argue logically . He 'd been foolish to argue with her , especially as he did , with irony and anger . When he and Vanessa began having difficulties about moving out of Beverly Glen into the Malibu hills , there was more silence than talk in the house . Amelia was wonderful then . Returning from school in Iowa , then from her first job-with Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis-she reminded them of what they were to each other , then tried to make up to each of them what was n't coming from the other . When Vanessa died , Amelia 's mourning took the form of preparing him to be alone . ( It did n't take much ; he 'd felt alone for years . ) <p> After college , she married James , a splendid , amusing fellow to whom he felt closer and closer . James worked in St. Louis , first for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amelia worked until Jennifer arrived , then became what she still was , a full-time housewife , parent , and unpaid worker for a dozen school and civic projects . <p> Spear 's biannual visits to St. Louis and the Abarbanels ' almostannual ones to the Malibu cabin were good ones . Then , a few years ago , Amelia changed . First , she became an exercise and diet freak . Not extraordinary , but she went too far and began to look gaunt , almost skeletal . When he expressed his concern and asked what her doctor said about it , she said , grimly , " I 'm an exceptionally healthy person . I wish you were . " He did n't respond to this odd response . Food was Amelia 's bugbear . The meals she prepared were tasteless ; it was a family joke at which she herself laughed loudest . James did a lot of the cooking , and there were many take-outs . <p> Her house too went on a sort of diet . She began replacing the comfortable sofas and chairs with spindle-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he suggested buying-and offered to buy-a few of the old comfortable , hospitable sort , she said , " What we have is perfect for us . " Once he sent her a fine pseudo-Fragonard painting which he 'd found in the back of a French junk store . It was full of round , pink-cheeked people cavorting in an elegant drawing room . When he visited , it was nowhere to be seen , and when he asked about it , she said , " I gave it to Grandpa Abarbanel who liked it . It was of his mental era-and yours , I guess . " Actually , except for a-to Spear-defiantly ugly Dubuffet reproduction and a few of Jennifer 's school daubs , the Abarbanel walls were bare . <p> As Amelia grew more and more angular , she wore shapeless clothes to conceal her once beautiful figure . Spear felt the pathos of this but said nothing . Yet he knew that Amelia sensed-and resented-his concern . Bravado crept into her . Her voice , which had been exceptionally lovely , was often metallic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt she was hiding what she felt . Her opinions too were a problem for him , less in themselves than in their narrow intensity . No one but James and Jennifer crossed her with ease . <p> More than anything she hated California and what she called " your business . " Growing up , she had n't wanted to leave ; her ambition was to go to school in Berkeley or Stanford . He and Vanessa had to persuade her that it might be good to see the rest of the country . As for " the business , " no one had been more of a film buff . At Grinnell , she 'd even practiced his trade and written movie reviews , quite good ones , for the school paper . Now she would n't go to movies , and when others talked about them , she turned away or said something like , " Ca n't we find something serious to talk about ? " <p> Was it a repudiation of him or a form of self-abandonment , the burial of her old ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more visits to California . And things began to go wrong with visits to St. Louis : " We 're going away , " or " We have visitors using the guest room . " He 'd visited them every Christmas for fifteen years . That stopped . As did her letters . She 'd been a wonderful letter writer , he 'd saved all her letters . She knew this , and he knew that was the reason she no longer wrote him . She was consciously depriving him of pleasure . Why ? He did n't know , did n't want to know . <p> Telephone calls , too , got briefer and rarer . Now the only time she called was on his birthday , and then she sang a self-mocking " Happy Birthday , " asked a few perfunctory questions , and said she had to go somewhere . When he phoned , she was always in a great hurry , she had to pick something up or someone was there with her . If he tried to talk about something personal , she 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or even , " You never do get things right . " <p> When Jennifer graduated from law school , Amelia did come out to California with James . They 'd all assembled in Davis and he 'd taken everyone to dinner . Amelia had looked preoccupied . She 'd been preparing to say what she did when she and James took off for the airport : " I do n't think it would be a good idea for you to see Jennifer when she starts work in San Francisco . I do n't think she should be distracted . In fact , Dad , I think for a while , you and I should keep a bit of distance between us . " While his mouth hung open and his heart burst in his chest , she got into the taxi next to James who smiled and waved goodbye . It was a terrible moment which , for a while , he thought he might not survive . <p> Both Spear and Jennifer spent Christmas alone . He did n't want to impose on her ; she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be going somewhere for Christmas dinner , Spear to Cousin Hugh 's , Jennifer to the Morgans ' . Christmas morning he telephoned . <p> " Thank you so much for the wine , Grandpa . I think it 's the first case I 've ever had . You should n't have-not after that wonderful check . " <p> " My pleasure , darling , and thank you for the beautiful argyles . I did n't think anybody under fifty knew how to knit anymore . " <p> " Mom taught me when I was eight or nine . I really love it . I just did n't have time for a while . I 'm making you another pair now . " As he said , " Oh , that 's more than I 'm entitled to , " he felt the chill of that extra time in his stomach . " I 'm going to put these on and wear them through Christmas . It 'll be almost like having you here . " <p> " I miss you too , Grandpa . If I had n't promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it 's probably better for me . Have you called Mom yet ? " <p> " I will now . I 'll tell her you sound fine . " <p> " She called me at 7:45 ; I 'm not sure I sounded too fine . " <p> It was a strange day for Spear . He had n't been alone on Christmas since-he hardly remembered-1949 in Florence , the week after breaking up with the French art student Marie France de Cristen who 'd come to him on the rebound-as they used to sayfrom a Norman aristocrat whose family had found hers untouchable . He 'd thought she was an aristocrat . Reading Proust that lonely Christmas opened up the complexity of feudal aristocracy to him . He hated it as he 'd grown up hating its English version . Still , Proust got him through his despair and the Florentine chill . The floor in his room at the Villa Fabricotti was marble , and the cold knifed through two pairs of wool socks and froze his fingers as he turned the amazing pages . <p> Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of despair and youth , he had Scotch and fear . <p> Christmas passed and Twelfth Night , and the holiday birthdays of King , Lincoln , and Washington . Spear did his taxes , gardened , walked , watched films on the VCR , wrote them up in his journal , looked at birds , the sky , the flowers . March , April , May , June . A year since Jenny had lost her job , and there was still no job . <p> Spear found it as awkward to speak about it with her as he did with her mother about California . Jennifer told him about interviews " coming up next week " or " when he gets back from New York . " Only occasionally did she sound anxious : " Sometimes I wonder if there 's anything out there for me . " Then Spear 's stomach looped in fear . Should he say something to her about cutting expenses , moving in with a friend ? How else could she cut down ? She had to eat , to look decent . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fer , have you thought about temp work ? " <p> " I thought I told you , Grandpa . I took a contingency case in March . Spent forty , fifty hours on it-and lost . Ca n't do that again . " <p> " You did n't tell me , no . I was wondering about public defenders . I know they do n't get paid as well as you used to , but are n't they needed ? Something you could do till something better turns up ? " <p> " I 've had my application in for months . They have their pick of lawyers , Grandpa , and not just ex-associates . " <p> What to do ? His despair deepened . Pretty soon he 'd have to talk with her father about working something out . The two of them could transfer some equities to her . He 'd pull in his own belt , drink cheaper whiskey , cut down the cigars , cancel subscriptions . He certainly would n't buy the Sickert drawing he 'd been eyeing in the Sotheby catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stopgaps were stopgaps ; but the gap widening with no closure in sight was in him . He began to have headaches , stomach aches . <p> " You better cut down the Scotch and cigars , " said his old friend Ez Keneret . <p> " I have . I do . " <p> " When 's the last time you had a check-up ? " <p> " No idea , I do n't need them . This business with Jennifer is dragging on me . I 've got to find her something . " <p> " No you do n't . She 'll find something herself , when she 's good and ready . What you need is to get away . It 'll be good for her and good for you . " Large and authoritative , Keneret banged his right fist into his left palm for emphasis . <p> " Get away where ? Why ? " <p> " Does n't matter where . St. Louis . Make up with your daughter .

" <p> " Sure she would . Everyone loves longtime guests . " He searched for his cigar and matches but remembering , put the unlit cigar in his mouth . " I wish to God I could smoke this . Why should I leave what I love ? " He spread his arms , an air hug for his cabin . <p> " To get your mind off Jennifer 's business .

But it 's nearly a year and a half . It 's frightening . " <p> " I swear to you , Wendell . If worse comes to worst , I can use her myself . I 'll ask Ira Stein to assign her to my affairs and yours and three or four other people . She 'll more than earn her keep . " <p> Spear lit his cigar , went to the bottle of Chivas Regal , and poured himself a good glass full . " Wine ? " he called out to Keneret , but his friend was up . <p> " I 'd better get going . I hope you do n't have any trouble up here . " <p> While he cooked his hamburger , Spear sipped Scotch and , watching the fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been alert enough to turn off the set because when he woke to shouts and banging on his door , the set was dark . Dazed , he made out his name , shouted , " Spear , Mr. Spear ! " His door chimes were ringing . There was banging on the door . " You 've got to get out . Fire ! You 've got to get out now . " <p> He hustled to the door , opened it on two wild-eyed young men , one of whom was Roger from the Mobil station . " What ? What- " <p> " Mr. Spear , " said Roger , " you 've got to hurry . Right now . Get your car and drive down to the Coast Motel . We 've got to warn some others . Take care , " and they drove off in the station truck . <p> Spear ran for his car keys , his wallet and on the way out , grabbed the bottle of Scotch . He set off down the road in his Mustang . It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard something like a deep sucking sound , as if the whole hill were sighing . His head was clear now , and he drove the Mustang carefully round the curves , down to the ocean . Soon he was part of a row of cars , almost unheard of up here . The Pacific Highway was a parking lot , and a casting call , people in nightgowns , rain coats , odd sweaters and slacks . Several people were in evening dress . There were lots of children in pajamas . Many were being held . Many couples held each other . Police whirl lights lit faces , which looked stunned , drained , scared , furious . A fire truck escorted by a marshal 's car made its way up the hill . Spear watched the red whirl light disappear , then saw , far away , terrifying , a flame knife out of the blackness . There were screams from others who 'd seen it . Then a smaller flame , gold and blue , broke out in another part of the dark . Heart pumping fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his car and opened the Scotch . He was shivering . Some old knowledge stirred in his bones . What was it ? Yes , the war , Grandpa holding his hand , walking near the Thames . A plane like a gray ghost was overhead , then a terrible whine and a shower of light . A six-story building down the block shook like a huge plum pudding , there was smoke , fire , smashed glass , brick dust , people running . He was running , heart beating so fast he felt it would leap from his chest . " Oh , God , " he said now . " The cabin . My place . " <p> Sometime in the morning-the air dark with ash-he started the car and drove toward his road . A police car blocked it , and a policeman said , " You ca n't go up there . " <p> " I do n't see any fire . " <p> " They think they 've put it out , but it 's still a mess . Only firemen can go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If I were you , I 'd find a place to stay tonight . " <p> Spear turned the car around and drove south on 101 . The first motel had the No Vacancy sign out , so did the second . Spear found a phone booth , but the phone did n't function . He drove to Santa Monica . <p> Marcia opened the door . " Oh , Wendell , thank God . We were terrified for you . " She embraced him . Ez came out in pajamas and , for the first time in his life , embraced him also . <p> After he washed up and put on a pair of Ez 's slacks and his bathrobe , he joined them on the terrace . Over coffee and eggs served by their beautiful Filipino maid , Lourdes , he told them what had happened . Then he called St. Louis and San Francisco to tell Amelia and Jennifer he was okay . <p> Two days later , he drove back up the half melted road toward his house . It had been swept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutters . Gray particles still floated in the air , and there was a foul , acrid smell . After a mile , the road was as strange to him as if he 'd never lived there . When he came on a neighbor 's house intact , his heart raced with hope . Beyond , though , there was ash , rubble , charred branches , stripped and broken palms and cypress . <p> He drove past what had been his driveway , then after half a mile turned back and found it . He parked on the edge of the road and walked through rubble to the black stumps which had been his cabin . He found a long-handled aluminum skimmer , pots , a framed picture , a toilet bowl , a sink , even a few books , some , amazingly , untouched . " It 's over , over . " He skimmed up what looked like a piece of black jade : a burnt squirrel . He heard a scraping noise across what had been the terrace and looked up into the dark , wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackened branch . For some reason , Spear tossed it the squirrel , which plopped into ash . The deer 's eyes were dense-as Spear saw them-with ruin . <p> That he should be here in St. Louis , sleeping in his granddaughter 's old room , looking at the yellowing strands of the neighbor 's willow tree as she 'd looked at them the first seventeen years of her life , was still , in his third week here , as strange to him as the metamorphosis of his daughter into the loving daughter she had once been . <p> Perhaps it was his metamorphosis that had brought hers about : from an authoritative , house-holding husband , father , lecturer , and critic to a homeless , jobless , wifeless old man . Amelia had taken up this reduced self and become its thoughtful , affectionate , amusing caretaker and companion . He was her concern , her occupation . There was no alien metal in her voice . They walked , shopped , went to the zoo , the aviary , heard lectures at Washington University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost every day they lunched in a different restaurant . The internal devil that had starved her into disappearance had also disappeared . She ate with appetite and ease , hungrily , even greedily , pasta , pizza , burgers , melts . What he left on his plate , she took on hers . They drank wine . He smoked cigars , and they talked about everything , Jennifer , Vanessa , James , Grandpa Abarbanel , his parents , England , Florence . Who would have guessed the ruination of his life would have led him to this ? " You can live here always , Dad . " <p> James too , solid , amused , busy not only marketing beer but with volunteer work for the schools , bicycle paths , and river reclamation , also seemed to enjoy the presence of his father-in-law . " It 's wonderful for Amelia , " he told Spear . <p> Then the temperature sank , snow fell , and Spear knew he was n't going to spend much more time as a pensioner in his daughter 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shriveling elders with chins tilted into shafts of sun or resting on the knobs of canes . Dwindling toward the cemetery . Maybe it was not the worst way to slide off the earth , but it was not his way . <p> In his fifth and penultimate St. Louis week , Spear received a check from the home insurance company half again as much as he 'd expected . It was clear that he could rebuild the cabin , but in one of those life-deciding half-seconds , he knew he would n't . Ten days earlier , he 'd had a call from the Astrid Temple Foundation renewing an offer made and remade over the last years to buy his property for the wildlife preserve they wanted to set up in the Malibu hills . Instead of taking advantage of his fire-ruined property , they 'd unaccountably doubled their highest offer . Spear telephoned his accountant and asked her to assess his tax situation . She called the next day and told him that he 'd be in very good shape . <p> " All monied up and no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must know realtors out here , " she said . <p> " Why out there ? " <p> " Well , in St. Louis , then , if that suits you better now . I can understand that . The fire , your daughter . " <p> " No , it 's not the past , Frances.The world lies all before me . This world and the next . " <p> " I do n't like the sound of that , Wendell . We 've lost enough clients this year . " <p> " You wo n't lose this one , Frances . I 've had my fill of loss for a while too . " <p> The most unexpected consequence of the fire had to do with Jennifer . Ira Stein , Keneret 's lawyer , called Keneret who called Spear who called Jennifer to tell her that PSMI-Pacific Shoreline Mortgage Insurers-was immediately hiring lawyers to deal with the complex legal problems raised by the southern California fires . " I know you were n't keen about working in the LA area , darling , but Ira thinks this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction loans , I forget what else . " <p> " I know something about property law , Grandpa . We did some work for a real estate investment trust . Will you thank Mr. Stein for me ? I 'll get in touch with them today . " <p> A week later , Jennifer called her parents and grandfather to tell them that she was on staff with PSMI . The salary was twelve thousand dollars more than she made her third year at SB &C.; " And I like the people enormously . " <p> Especially , it turned out , one person , the man who 'd interviewed her , the supervising partner , Jay Volkman , " a thirty-eight year-old divorce , " as Spear learned in his first call to Jennifer from Italy . <p> Melanie Minolitte had been drawn to Lake Como by La Chartreuse de Parme . Fabrizio del Dongo was born in Griante-Stendhal misspelled it Granta-and the Countess Sanseverina grew up among the hills which , she told herself , " were never forced to yield a return . " Everything was " noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry trees still colored the slopes , and , beyond them , Melanie could see the Alps . There was a history of the villa in her room , a train of names and dates to those who 'd never lived here , but for Melanie , an enchantment . Augustus Caesar had been proconsul of the region ; Bonaparte made Josephine 's son Eugene its Viceroy ; the luminati , Beccaria , Verri , and the Abbe Parini , lived in this and other villas up and down the promontories ; John F. Kennedy , days from proclaiming that he was a Berliner , took over the villa for a night with Sophia Loren . <p> That randy interlude closed out the history , though scholars , scientists , artists , industrialists , and officials from all over the world held fellowships and conferences that made a history of their own . Melanie 's companion , Hansl , spent eight hours a day merged with his computer , while she read in the lovely library and looked across the lake at the stone brows of Mt . Grigna , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menaggio to Varenna , Cadenabbia to Lecco . She read and waited for lunch , delicate pasta dishes and risotti , salads and souffles the chefs rustled up for the scholars , their spouses , and lovers . <p> One morning , she shared the library with an old American who smoked cigars and drank coffee while he read by the window . She caught him looking at her . He jiggled the cigar . " Bother you ? " " I like the smell . " <p> " No , you do n't . " He doused the brown stump in the coffee . " I got here yesterday . When did you come ? " <p> " Three weeks ago . " <p> " Perhaps you 'll show me the ropes . " <p> " Excuse me ? " <p> " Tell me where things are , explain to me how things work . " He had a nice , wicked smile . His small teeth overlapped each other and were tobacco-stained . <p> " I 'll show you what I know . It 's not much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minolitte . " <p> He started to get up but shook his head to show he had the will but not the energy for courtesy . " I 'm Wendell Spear . And you 're named after Olivia de Havilland ? " <p> " Oh yes , I guess so . Though I 'm really more like Scarlett . " <p> " We 'll see . Where did you see the movie ? " <p> " Rosario , " and to his facial question , " Argentina . Have you been there ? " <p> " I 'm not a traveler . " <p> " You 're here . " <p> " Not traveling . Settling . Thinking of settling . " <p> " May I ask where you 've been settled ? " <p> " Los Angeles . The Malibu hills . I lost my house there . In a fire . I 'm thinking of buying somewhere on Lake Como . Want to help me look for a house ? " <p> " Perhaps . I 'm a good looker . " <p> " That you are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught the train to Varenna where , to his surprise , Sarah Nachzimmer waited at the depot . She gave him-more surprise-a chill smooch on the lips , grabbed his bags , and headed up the cobblestoned salita like a goat . A hundred and eighty steps . By the time he 'd made it to her terrace , heaving and sweating , she was sipping a thin glass of punt y mes , and had one for him . " This 'll fix you up . " <p> Nothing would fix him up , but he sat on a couch and drank with relief . <p> " I would n't drink it too fast . " <p> A big girl , shaped a bit like the mountain over her left shoulder : sloping shoulders , heavy torso under an Italian designer sack from which stretched her impressive Reeboks . Her hair , in tight braids , was intended , thought Spear , to be a Renaissance hairdo , but Sarah Nachzimmer was kilos and centuries from Ginevra da Benci . <p> " A good warning . This is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And honor . Ezra told me how distinguished you were . I wish you had more time . Or I did . He probably told you I have to be in Milan the eighteenth . A distributors ' meeting . Then there 's the opening of Louie Wants Janet . " <p> " Ezra confers favors , not information . Still there 's time to buy you what the town offers . " <p> " Very kind , Wendell-may I ? " <p> " Of course . And you 're Sarah . " <p> " The best meals are here . I like to cook . It 'll be the only useful thing I 've done since I 've been here . Have n't even written a memo . I hate vacations . " <p> The punt y mes was doing its trick . He was able to fill his own glass , and , half way into that , did n't care about changing his shirt . What an efficiently hospitable girl she was . ( Thirty-five , at least , but girl was the word Spear grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ) <p> " Ezra says you 're off to that scholars ' center in Bellagio . " " Yes , they 'd asked me several times and I did n't do anything about it till I lost my house . They said I could come . I was amazed they 'd invited me in the first place . " <p> " Ezra says you 're very learned . " <p> " I used to be able to fool a few people . Hope it 's half as pretty as this . " He waved his punt y mes at the surrounding birch and cyprus . " The trees look as if your place is an intrusion . The way the scholars are going to look at me . " <p> " Is it the fire that 's depressed you or are you always selfdeprecating ? " <p> " You should know me as I know me . It 's an English hangover . Supposed to put people at ease , but of course it annoys or bores them . " <p> " Not me . It 's just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good one . " She held up the bottle . " Or shall I open our dinner wine ? " <p> " This is awfully good . " He held out the glass for the refill . " It 's good to be here , though I had doubts on your hill . I 'm a poor climber . Once you 're here , it 's a wonderful place . " <p> " You 're supposed to get out of Milan smog every few days . I got this place for the air , un pied a l'air . But I 'm a bad get-awayer . " She tossed her braided head toward Milan . " My life 's down there . Even with my Mac I 'm uneasy here . It 's better when there 's a visitor . " " That 's kind of you . " <p> " If you were n't here , I 'd be yelling at the birches . If only I could cook for them . I should n't have bought the place . I tell myself it 's an investment . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good at what you do , but I do n't think he said what it was . " <p> " I do n't do anything now . " <p> " He did say you were one of the few people who understands what movies are about . " <p> " Too generous . Oops . I 'll stop my little act . Anyway , maybe I will do something again , but right now , no . I do n't know how things are done anymore . I used to write about the way they were done . " <p> " For a paper ? " <p> " Rarely . I 'm death on deadlines . I wrote articles , a couple of books , lectured at film schools . " <p> " That 's important , " she said like a teacher giving a C. <p> After supper-lake trout , risotto , salad , Pinot Grigio , all served in a whirl , but perfectly-Spear took himself off to a sheeted plank more like a warning than a bed . After a few reflections on the body of his hostess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd dodged since the fire , the conviction that it had punished him for living the wrong way , for not following the best part of his nature , settling too early for security and pleasure . The worst feeling was that he did n't regard his wasted life as a tragedy . " It is n't , " he told himself , " as if Shakespeare had become a butcher instead of a playwright . " <p> Step by small step , Spear had made his life smaller and smaller . Spear , who felt himself a born small man , now felt as small as he could ; and he was glad he was too old to change . Age exonerated him now . One of the few books he 'd managed to save from the fire contained lines of Aristotle about old men : They love as though they will one day hate , and hate as though they will one day love .... They think but never know . " It 's just that we want to slide through , " he explained to Aristotle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be Old Man or someone who 's failed A Failure . <p> What would happen if he knocked on Sarah 's door ? <p> He did n't . Nor was there a knock on his door . <p> The next day , she carried his bag downhill , then put him on the white boat that crossed to Bellagio . <p> The rain was spectacular , thrashing the lake , scalloping the waves , touching off waterfalls in the mountains . Film noir rain . Then , boom , over , and silver sunlight broke the mist . Everything was forgiven , forgotten . No wonder history kept coming back to this place . <p> He shook puffs of shaving cream flecked with white hair over the ironwork balcony . Renewed , like the lake . Not quite . Eating the sauce-rich cuisine , drinking wine twice a day and brandy after dinner , smoking cigars , and gabbing with Melanie and the scholars in a social excitement he had n't known for twenty-odd years , upset his system . His head and stomach aches multiplied even after he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept much of the day , but , one day , after drinking a little soup for lunch , he keeled over . <p> Keneret flew to Milan , then drove to Como with the ambulance he 'd hired to transport Spear to the Milan airport from the Ospedale San Giovanni . He was not going to let him be operated on thousands of miles away from California in the hospital of a small Italian city . " I 'm fetching him back , " he 'd told Amelia Abarbanel . <p> " I 'm so grateful , Uncle Ez , " she said . " It 's taken me three days to decide to go over . Now I 'll just meet you in California . I do n't know how to thank you . " <p> " I 'm doing it for me , sweetie . I 'm not ready to lose your father 's surly company . " <p> Spear needed neither ambulance to nor hospital berth on the plane . He 'd been sedated but was alert and , within minutes , dressed and ready to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invalid . " <p> " A vegetable , " said Keneret . " A cigar-smoking zucchini . " <p> " I 'm afraid it 's no more cigars , " said Spear . " As for zucchini , we 'll see what happens in LA . Or at least you will . " <p> Keneret draped Spear 's sport coat around his shoulders . " I think we could use a wheelchair to get you to the car . " <p> " Your arm will do . " <p> Spear shuddered when he saw the ambulance , but it turned out to be useful : he lay on the bed and slept the half-hour ride to Linati . <p> In the first days after the operation , Spear could n't speak . He made noises , his eyes seemed to take in visitors , he even scribbled on a pad , sometimes a word or two that could be read , but mostly scribbles , small and neat like his beautiful handwriting , but scribbles , not letters . Keneret drew up a chart of words and short sentences at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " I want , " he wrote " water , " " Kleenex , " " newspaper , " " magazines , " " Jennifer , " " Amelia , " " a nurse , " " a doctor , " " pain-killer " and so on . Next to " I am , " the list read " hot , " " cold , " " thirsty , " " hungry , " " uncomfortable , " " all right , " " in bad shape , " and so on . Keneret held the chart up to Spear 's swollen face and pointed to the words that would complete the sentences to see if Spear could blink or otherwise acknowledge his wants . " I do n't think he 's seein ' real good , " said Clary , the nurse , a large black woman who talked to Spear as if he were a four-year-old : " Now Wendell , do n't you fuss with that tube . You want Clary to have to tie your hands ? " <p> Jennifer-of whom Keneret got fonder each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she said , " I 'm not sure he follows what we say . " <p> By the end of the third week , the catheters , Foleys , and NGs were out of Spear 's nose , arms , and penis , and he was able to walk up and down the hall . His head size had diminished , and he talked well enough to be understood , though he could n't talk for long . " I do n't remember anything shince the operation , do n't remember you coming to shee me . Found the chart you made , though . Sho good of you . I 'm going to keep it . " <p> Keneret liked that . It meant Spear was looking ahead . Days before , he 'd smelled of death ; everything in and about him said , " I 'm finished . " A great hunk of his throat and the musculature in his right arm had been torn out . Radiation had lumped , swollen , and twisted him . He still joked , but mostly about his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rubbed his sore arm , exposed his dry gums and weakened teeth , jabbed to dislodge small black placques of unsalivated flesh . <p> Spear settled or was settled by Jennifer and Amelia down the street from the Kenerets in the cleaned-up , de-termited , freshly painted Iwinaga house . ( Mrs. Iwinaga had been reluctantly carried off by her daughter to Woodland Hills , where , she told Marcia-devastated by the departure of this oldest and best of neighbors- " nothing grow there . Water , water , water , and like desert . " ) Spear , weak as he was , relished Mrs. Iwinaga 's shrubbery and had Lourdes-who was helping his regular nurses- tell her that he would have them attended to properly . Indeed , the first weeks here , George , a bulky forty-year-old nurse whom Amelia had plucked from the hospital pool , watered the lawn , but by the time his stint with Spear concluded , it had lost much of its green distinction . <p> George was soon the indispensable person in Spear 's final entourage . He entertained Spear 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He served the splendid coffee Lourdes brewed out of the fifty-pound sack of Kenya beans Marcia Keneret ordered from Trader Joe 's and , while Lourdes guarded Spear , drove Marcia there to fetch home the exotic goodies with which , at the beginning , she tried to rouse his appetite . " For life , " she told George . Spear could barely sip the black brew but , nose unimpaired , he sniffed its fumes . " Almosht as good as shigars , " he said , in his defective postsurgical manner . ( It was not just altered phonemes which came from his mouth ; his thick forefinger constantly scratched blackened plaque from it . ) <p> " Those terrible things , " muttered Amelia . " They started the cancer . " <p> " Maybe it wush alwaysh there , waiting to come out . " He jabbed toward his cup . " More fumesh pleash , George . " <p> George 's clientele was terminal . ( " But are n't we all ? " he said cheerfully . ) Few lived in sunny houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates , and framed dust jackets . ( The Kenerets told him that these were only what Spear had stored and so preserved from the fire . ) <p> " Wendell had eggs for lunch , " George reported . <p> " How were they , Wendell ? " asked Keneret . <p> " Like their eater , shcrambled . " <p> " Ha , ha.What a card he is . " George laughed into the kitchen where in his rare free time he read a biography of Marlene Dietrich . " I guess you and I are the only people she never fucked , " he said to Spear . " Or should I speak only for myself ? " <p> It was hard to imagine George in any woman 's bed , though , long ago , Spear learned not to be surprised by any sexual alliance or proclivity . " I mished my chance . " A cough , a jab at his mouth , which George irrigated with antibiotic wash . " If she could only shee me now . " <p> " You 'd knock her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amelia , and the Kenerets was closer to Spear than George and his evening replacement , Lucia . Like George , a recruit from the nurses ' pool , gentle , indefatigable Lucia had come north from Guatemala thirty years ago . Like George , she loved caring for terminal patients , even when , as in Spear 's case , she grew so fond of them that she had to take days off after they died . <p> George , Lucia , and occasionally Lourdes answered the phones , helped Spear with his correspondence and bills , prepared the cans of Senilac , his chief nourishment , bathed him , toileted him and , when his speech disintegrated even more , interpreted it for others . <p> Amelia had returned to St. Louis and was in the air , flying back to Santa Monica , when Spear died . As it happened , Jennifer too was away , the first weekend she had n't had to work . When , a week earlier , she 'd leaned over her shrunken grandfather to tell him that she and Jay were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd managed to make out the last words of his she would hear , " Have a good trip , darling . " She kept herself from saying , " You too , dearest Grandpa . " <p> At the visit before that , Spear , in bed , followed her with his small , black , watery eyes , but said nothing , till Lucia encouraged him to speak . He muttered something . Jennifer leaned close but could n't make it out ; Lucia , however , could . " I know what he 's speaking , Miss Jennifer . From that book . He pointed it out for me , and I marked it . " Spear nodded yes . It was Shakespeare , and Jennifer too now recognized one of her grandfather 's favorites . She read it aloud . It was from All 's Well That Ends Well , lines that the wicked boaster Captain Parolles speaks after his plot has been exposed and he 's been stripped of his captaincy . He begs for his life , and after he 's granted it , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T would burst at this . Captain I 'll be no more ; But I will eat , and drink , and sleep as soft As captain shall . Simply the thing I am Shall make me live .... <p> That night , at home , Jennifer reread the lines and felt she understood why her grandfather 's self-deprecation and love of life had fused in this expression of reform and self-acceptance . <p> Two weeks later , at his small funeral service , she read them aloud . <p>
