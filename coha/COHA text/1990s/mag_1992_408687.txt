Lawerence Bossidy , ceo of Allied-Signal , predicts " organizational revolution " for corporate America . Says David Nadler , president of Delta Consulting Group , who works with the chiefs of AT &T,; Corning , and Xerox , among others : " CEOs feel that companies need to be structured in dramatically different ways . " In outfits as diverse as Eastman Kodak , Hallmark Cards , and General Electric  --  even the San Diego Zoo  --  the search for the organization perfectly designed for the 21st century is going ahead with the urgency of a scavenger hunt . From many quarters we hear that hierarchical organization must wither away . In this view of the future middle managers have the life expectancy of fruit flies . Those who survive will not be straw bosses but Dutch uncles , dispensing resources and wisdom to an empowered labor force that designs its own jobs . Enabled , to use a trendy term , by information technology and propelled by the need to gain speed and shed unnecessary work , this flat , information-based organization wo n't look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what ? Like a symphony orchestra , Peter Drucker suggests . No , a jazz combo , some say . More like a spider web , others offer . Hamlet : Or like a whale ? Polonius : Very like a whale . Gee , thanks . But where 's my desk ? What do I do eight hours a day or ten , or 12 ? Who gives me my annual review ? When do we start ? Good questions , which as yet have not had good answers . Says H. James Maxmim , the CEO of Laura Ashley Holdings : " We 're just beginning to explore the post-hierarchical organization . We do n't know what it looks like yet . " Some hints , however , are emerging . The 21st-century organization arises at the confluence of three streams . One is described by the term " high-involvement workplace , " meaning operations with selfmanaging teams and other devices for empowering employees . Novelties once , these participative mechanisms have proved they can consistently deliver jaw-dropping gains in productivity , quality , and job satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business processes  --  materials handling , say  --  rather than functional departments like purchasing and manufacturing . Third is the evolution of information technology to the point where knowledge , accountability , and results can be distributed rapidly anywhere in the organization . The trick is to put them together into a coherent , practical design . Then you have the company yours may become , and the one your sons and daughters will work for . At the end of this rainbow , say those who have peeked , is a whole kettleful of gold . Advises Bossidy , who until last summer was vice chairman of General Electric : " Look at GE Appliances . " In that $5.4-billion-a-year business , redesign has brought with it a $200 million drop in average inventory . McKinsey &; Co. principal Douglas Smith , one of the blue-chip consulting firm 's experts on organization , figures that a company applying the new principles of organization design can cut its cost base by a third or more . Smith bases his claim on results from companies that have already reorganized parts of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised productivity more than 50% , a financial services company where costs fell 34% , and others . Results like that come from changing a company in profound ways , not just tinkering with the boxes on an organization chart . For years , Smith says , the basic question about how best to arrange people and jobs stayed the same : " Do we centralize or decentralize  --  and where do we stick international ? " The answer was never satisfactory . Companies were set up by product , or by customer , or by territory , and then switched when those arrangements stopped working . All that rejiggering missed the point , says Smith : " It mattered only to the top people in the company . Below them you found the same functional , vertical organization . For the 90% of the people who serve customers and make product , all that changed was the boss 's name . " No longer . The Kodaks , GEs , and their ilk have first retailored the work people do , then management structures , with startling results . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Smith and his colleague Frank Ostroff are polishing a paper that lays out what Ostroff calls " perhaps the first real , fundamentally different , robust alternative " to the functional organization ( see box ) . ( Box omitted ) In the months since Ostroff released an early draft to his consulting colleagues , it has proved the document most often requested inside the firm . There 's nothing new about self-managing teams  --  they were " discovered " 43 years ago at the bottom of a coal mine in Yorkshire by a researcher from the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London . Since then , forms of worker self-management have been adopted at countless sites . Marvin Weisbord , an expert on organizational development , notes that all rely on one basic idea : " The people who do the work should have in their hands the means to change to suit the customer . " That means workers should have the incentive and the power to respond to whoever buys their output  --  at times someone else within their organization  --  not just whoever cuts their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in output per man-hour . To see how it 's done , skip the blackjack table next time you 're in Puerto Rico and pay a visit to Bayamon , outside San Juan , where a new General Electric factory has been running for a year and a half . The place makes arresters , which are surge protectors that guard power stations and transmission lines against lightning strikes . Bayamon is the godchild of Philip Jarrosiak , manager of human resources for GE 's capacitor and power protection operations . Once a minor-league infielder , Jarrosiak joined GE when he was 20 , landing an hourly job making aircraft engines in Rutland , Vermont . In the 32 years since , he put himself through college at night and worked his way into management ranks , where he specializes in designing high-performance workplaces at both greenfield and established sites . Bayamon is his newest and , Jarrosiak says , " an opportunity to put in everything I know . " The facility employs 172 hourly workers and just 15 salaried " advisers , " plus manager R. Clayton Crum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no staff . A conventional plant , Jarrosiak says , would have about twice as many salaried people . Every hourly worker is on a team with ten or so others ; they meet weekly . Each team " owns " part of the work  --  assembly , shipping and receiving , etc . But team members come from all areas of the plant , so that each group has representatives from both upstream and downstream operations . An adviser sits in the back of the room and speaks up only if the team needs help . What vaults Bayamon into the next century is the way it teaches its workers . Says Harvard professor Shoshanna Zuboff , author of in the Age of the Smart Machine : " The 21st-century company has to promote and nurture the capacity to improve and to innovate . That idea has radical implications . It means learning becomes the axial principle of organizations . It replaces control as the fundamental job of management . " Bayamon is a perpetual-learning machine . Hourly workers change jobs every six months , rotating through the factory 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin their second circuit of the plant , and everyone on the floor will know his job and how it affects the next person in line . The reward for learning is a triple-scoop compensation plan that pays for skill , knowledge , and business performance . The first time around , workers get a 25-cent-an-hour pay raise at each rotation ; thereafter they can nearly double their pay by " declaring a major , " so to speak , and learning a skill like machine maintenance or quality control . More pay comes from passing courses in English , business practices , and other subjects . Toss in bonuses  --  $225 a quarter or more  --  for meeting plantwide performance goals and having perfect attendance . Promotions and layoffs will be decided by skill level , not seniority . In just a year the work force became 20% more productive than its nearest company equivalent on the mainland , and Jarrosiak predicts productivity will rise 20% more by the end of 1993 . For years plants like Bayaman existed barely connected to the organizations of which they are a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago as 1968 , a fact concealed from competitors  --  and sometimes from headquarters . The Gaines pet food plant in Topeka , Kansas , just celebrated 20 years of self-management . For two decades , under three owners Anderson Clayton , General Foods , and Quaker Oats  --  Topeka has always placed first when its labor productivity was compared with that of other pet food plants within its company . According to Herman Simon , plant manager for 17 years , higher-ups who saw the numbers vowed never to mess with the plant . But they rarely went away determined to make their other factories over in its image . Says a frustrated William Buehler , senior vice president at Xerox : " You can see a high-performance factory or office , but it just does n't spread . I do n't know why . " One reason is that nervous executives experiment where failure wo n't be fatal , and thereby contain the gains too . Says Jarrosiak : " I hate pilot programs off in a corner of a plant . You need commitment . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit into a large-scale enterprise . Says McKinsey 's Ostroff : " Executives know what teams can do . But they need a picture that links the high-performance team to the whole organization and multiplies the gains . " It 's relatively easy to oversee one of these operations when it 's confined within one function , like manufacturing . For self-directed management to spread , a company must lay goals , responsibilities , and measurements across functions . Ostroff argues : " Senior managers need to be able to say " empowerment " and " accountability " in the same sentence . " Business processes  --  almost sure to become a term you will hear lots of can form the link between high-performance work teams and the corporation at large . Organizing around processes , as opposed to functions , permits greater self-management and allows companies to dismantle unneeded supervisory structures . It 's a management axiom that crab grass grows in the cracks between departments . Purchasing buys parts cheap , but manufacturing needs them strong . Shipping moves goods in bulk , but sales promised them fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Palermo , a vice president for quality and transition at Xerox . " If a problem has been bothering your company and your customers for years and wo n't yield , that problem is the result of a cross-functional dispute , where nobody has total control of the whole process . " And here 's Palermo 's corollary : People who work in different functions hate each other . Upon this fratricidal scene , enter the process doctor . Depending on which consulting firm he 's coming from , he may describe his work as " reengineering " or " core process redesign " or " process innovation . " Michael Hammer , a consultant in Cambridge , Massachusetts , defines , though not exactly lyrically , what the doctor is up to : " Reengineering is the fundamental analysis and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical measures of performance . " Process management differs from managing a function in three ways . First , it uses external objectives . Old-line manufacturing departments , for example , tend to be measured on unit costs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stacks of unsold goods . By contrast , an integrated manufacturing and shipping process might be rated by how often it turns over its inventory  --  a processs wide measurement that reveals how all are working together to keep costs down . Second , in process management employees with different skills are grouped to accomplish a complete piece of work . Mortgage loan officer , title searcher , and credit checker sit and work together , not in series . Third , information moves straight to where it 's needed , unfiltered by a hierarchy . If you have a problem with people upstream from you , you deal with them directly , rather than asking your boss to talk to theirs . Reengineered processes have been in place at Kodak for more than two years . The 1,500 employees who make black and white film  --  inevitably called Zebras  --  work not in departments but in what 's called " the flow . " ( Black and white is big business : about $2 billion a year from sales of 7,000 products used in printing , X-rays , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25-member leadership team watches the flow . They measure it with end-of-process tallies like productivity . Within the flow are streams defined by " customers "  --  Kodak business units  --  and scored on customer satisfaction measures such as on-time delivery . One stream , for example , is charged with making hundreds of types of film for the Health Sciences Division and works closely with it to schedule production and to develop new products , a Zebra specialty . In the streams most employees work in self-directed teams . A few functions  --  accounting and human resources  --  remain outside the streams . When the flow began in 1989 , the black and white film operation was running 15% over budgeted cost , took up to 42 days to fill an order , was late a third of the time , and scored worst in Kodak 's morale surveys . Last year the group came in 15% under budgeted cost , had cut response time in half , was late one time out of 20 , and wore the biggest smiles in Rochester , New York . Why ? Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a flow chart , you find where you 're wasting time , doing things twice . And because we own our entire process , we can change it . " Organizing around a process seems to yield sterling results as consistently as high-involvement factories do . Privately held Hallmark ( 1991 sales : $2.9 billion ) expects big gains now that Steven Stanton of CSC Index , a Cambridge , Massachusetts , consulting firm , has helped the company reengineer its new-product process . The greeting-card maker lives or dies on new stuff  --  some 40,000 cards and other items year , the work of 700 writers , artists , and designers on what Hallmark boasts is the world 's largest creative staff . The process of developing a new card had become grotesque ; it took two years  --  longer than the road from Gettysburg to Appomattox Court House . The company was choking on sketches , approvals , cost estimates , and proofs . Says Hallmark 's Don Fletcher : " We needed a lot of people just to check items in and out of departments . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretty much tells what happened . Starting this spring , about half the staff will be put to work on cards for particular holidays like Valentine 's Day or Christmas . The birthday and get-well card folks will follow . A team of artists , writers , lithographers , merchandisers , bean counters , and so on will be assigned to each holiday . Team members are moving from all over a two-million-square-foot office building in Kansas City so they can sit together . Like a canoe on a lake , a card will flow directly from one part of the process to the next within , say , the Mother 's Day team ; before , it had to be portaged from one vast department to the next . This should cut cycle time in half , which will not only save money but will also make the company more responsive to changing tastes . Hallmark has n't eradicated departments . There will be " centers of excellence " to which workers will return between projects for training and brief , special stints , a bit like homerooms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior managers of the business . But the head of graphic arts , which makes separations and proofs , has told Fletcher that he hopes the department infrastructure will eventually dissolve in the flow . That 's the right idea , say hard-core process managers . If you reengineer a process , pocket a one-time gain , and return to your desk , says McKinsey 's Smith , " the barnacles you scrape off will just grow back . " The way to keep them off , says Hammer , is to obliterate the functions : " In the future , executive positions will not be defined in terms of collections of people , like head of the sales department , but in terms of process , like **39;168;TOOLONG , which is sales , shipping , billing . You 'll no longer have a box on an organization chart . You 'll own part of a process map . Can a whole company literally lie on its side and organize horizontally , by process ? You got it , says Allied-Signal 's Bossidy : " Every business has maybe six basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who run them will be the leaders of the business . " An industrial company might select processes like new-product development , flow of materials ( purchasing , receiving , manufacturing ) , and the order-delivery billing cycle . Into these process flows will go management teams to tend subprocesses and teams of workers to carry out tasks . Whoever is needed will be there : The materials-flow group might have finance folks but no marketers  --  but the marketers will be plentiful in the new-product process . There are no departments in Bossidy 's 21st-century corporation : " You might have a CFO , but he wo n't have many people who report to him . " If metallurgists and actuaries are taken out of departments and clumped around processes , what happens to their specialized skills ? A minor problem , argues James Champy , CEO of CSC Index : " State-ofthe-art knowledge comes from a small group of people . Most people in a function do n't contribute expertise . They execute . " Put the innovators in a stafflike or lablike group . Create a house Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersed . Link experts in a real or electronic network where they can keep each other up to date and can get training and career development help . " That 's okay , " says Bossidy . " The engineers can have a club . But they ca n't work in the same room , and they ca n't sit at the same table at the company banquet . " His vision is somewhat radical , he admits , understating the case . " So corporations will first try to make the matrix work . Boy , that will drive employees and managers nuts . " One trouble with breaking down the walls : In most companies functional and hierarchical walls are load bearing . Remove them and the roof caves in . A big burden they bear is to collect , evaluate , and pass on information . Another is to determine employees ' career paths  --  to define ambition reward , and sycophancy . In a flat shop of teams and processes , both information flow and careers will have to be different . Walk around futuristic companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers ' offices ; widely available , easy-to-read charts tracking scrap , on-time delivery , and other data that rivals would kill for ; hourly workers logged onto PCs , reading their E-mail . They 're all part of an effort to put information where it can be used at the moment it 's needed . Says Delta Consulting 's David Nadler : " In the organization of the future , information technology will be a load-bearing material  --  as hierarchy is now . You ca n't have self-management without it . " That is , computer networks and the information they carry will help define your corporate structure . Let information flow wherever it 's needed , and a horizontal self-managed company is not only possible , it 's inescapable . Building computer highways that can transport cost and other data sideways within a process , as well as vertically to top management , is a step in this direction . Other steps include training that teaches workers how their actions affect overall business performance and measurements that direct tasks at optimum outcomes , such as rewarding salespeople for gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power as well as knowledge . In a hierarchy , rank defines authority : A manager can okay deals up to $50,000 , his boss to $100,000 , her boss to $250,000 ... That 's obsolete , in Harvard business school professor Quinn Mills 's view . The question is n't how high the money gets ; it 's how high your customer 's blood pressure gets . " Does he need an answer immediately ? Do you have to be able to be flexible ? If so , you have to empower the person who talks to the customer . " If you ca n't entrust such matters to the folks in the field , maybe you should switch places with them . They can have your desk , where the decisions , obviously , are less important . What happens to the career ladder ? CSC Index Chief Executive Champy suggests that law firms , with only three levels of hierarchy  --  associate , partner , and senior partner  --  might provide the very model of modern career path . Says Champy : " A lawyer 's career is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important clients . Titles do n't change , but everyone knows who has the highest status . " The oldest art in organization design  --  carving out strategic business units  --  will still matter in this new world . The goal , as Nadler sees it , is to create " enterprises with clear customers , markets , and measures , and few internal boundaries . " That means letting sets of customers or customer needs define business units , and grouping into businesses the people and processes necessary to serve them . That 's how Xerox designed its new horizontal organization . Till this year , Xerox was set up in the usual functions  --  R &D,; manufacturing , sales , and the like . The new design creates nine businesses aimed at markets such as small businesses and individuals , office document systems , and engineering systems . Each business will have an income statement and a balance sheet , and an identifiable set of competitors . New manufacturing layouts will permit so-called focused factories dedicated to specific businesses . Most of the businesses will sell through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping , installation , service , and billing , created so customers can keep just one phone number on their Rolodexes . In fact , the businesses will sell to Customer Operations  --  that is , negotiate contract  --  so that market forces extend deeply into the company . Teams lead the businesses , whose building blocks are what CEO Paul Allaire calls " microenterprise units " : complete work processes or subprocesses . Says Allaire : " We 've given everyone in the company a direct line of sight to the customer . " In a functional hierarchy , job descriptions , career paths , and information flow are all geared toward control  --  of work , workers , and knowledge . Compare that with the evolving 21st-century company , where work is lined up with customers , not toward bosses . Senior executives have charge of the handful of processes that are critical to satisfying customers . Self-directed , the work force does most of the hiring , scheduling , and other managerial tasks that once ate up kazillions in indirect labor costs . The few people left between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the organization , not to control it : They are reaching out to grab a new technology or a new customer , or to respond to a new demand from an old one . Jobs , careers , and knowledge shift constantly . The boundaries of the company will be fluid too . The growing number of strategic alliances suggests as much . So do the actions of companies like WalMart Stores and Procter &; Gamble , which have interwoven their order-and-fulfillment process so that the bells of Wal-Mart 's cash registers in effect ring in P &G; warehouses , telling them to ship a new box of Tide to replace the one you just bought . In the view of Harvard economist Robert Reich , the boundaries will become so fluid that corporations will become temporary arrangements among entrepreneurial cadres . Except for high-volume , capital-intensive work , says Reich , " every big company will be a confederation of small ones . All small organizations will be constantly in the process of linking up into big ones . " That may be more fluidity than most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , " How long have you been with your current employer ? " But the new flexible organization will be a powerful competitor . Smith finds a metaphor in Terminator II , the movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger faces a metal monster that liquefies , then hardens again in a new shape now a man , now a machine , now a knife . Says Smith : " I call it the Terminator II company . " How 'd you like to have to compete with one of those ? McKINSEY 'S PLAN It 's hot stuff at McKinsey &; Co. these days : a ten-point blueprint for a horizontal company prepared by Frank Ostroff and Doug Smith , consultants in the firm 's organization-performance group . ( 1 ) Organize primarily around process , not task . Base performance objectives on customer needs , such as low cost or fast service . Identify the processes that meet ( or do n't meet ) those needs  --  order generation and fulfillment , say , or new-product development . These processes  --  not departments , such as sales or manufacturing become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy by minimizing subdivision of processes . It 's better to arrange teams in parallel , with each doing lots of steps in a process , than to have a series of teams , each doing fewer steps . ( 3 ) Give senior leaders chase of processes and process performance . ( 4 ) Link performance objectives and evaluation of all activities to customer satisfaction . ( 5 ) Make teams , not individuals , the focus of oiganization performance and design . Individuals acting alone do n't have the capacity to continuously improve work flows . ( 6 ) Combine managerial and nonmanagerial activities as often as possible . Let workers ' teams take on hiring , evaluating , and scheduling . ( 7 ) Emphasize that each employee should develop several competencies . You need only a few specialists . ( 8 ) Inform and train people on a just-in-time , need-to-perform basis . Raw numbers go straight to those who need them in their jobs , with no managerial spin , because you have trained front-line workers  --  salesmen , machinists  --  how to use them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the organization . That means field trips and slots on joint problem-solving teams for all employees all the time . ( 10 ) Reward individual skill development and team performance instead of individual performance alone . WHAT A ZOO CAN TEACH YOU The Zoological Society of San Diego has done more than most businesses to transform itself into a 21st-century organization . It deserves to be seen for its management as well as for its spectacular collection of beasts and birds . With 1,200 year-round employees , $75 million in revenues , and five million visitors a year , the San Diego Zoo and its Wild Animal Park make a sizable outfit whose competitors  --  among them Walt Disney and AnheuserBusch , owner of nearby Sea World  --  are real gorillas . Also , as a world-renowned scientific and conservation organization , the zoo must maintain high technical standards and a Caesar's-wife purity on environmental and other issues . The zoo is steadily remodeling to show its animals by bioclimatic zone ( an African rain forest called Gorilla Tropics , or Tiger River , an Asian jungle environment ) rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displays open  --  three out of ten are finished  --  they 're fundamentally altering the way the zoo is run . The old zoo was managed through its 50 departments  --  animal keeping horticulture , maintenance , food service , fund raising , education , and others . It had all the traits of functional management , says David Glines , head of employee development . Glines started out as a groundsman , responsible for keeping paths clear of trash . If he was tired or rushed , Glines remembers , " sometimes I 'd sweep a cigarette butt under a bush . Then it was the gardener 's problem , not mine . " The departments are invisible in the redesigned parts of the zoo . Tiger River , for instance , is run by a team of mammal and bird specialists , horticulturists , and maintenance and construction workers . The four-year-old team , led by keeper John Turner , tracks its own budget on a PC that is n't hooked up to the zoo 's mainframe . Members are jointly responsible for the display , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path in front of an aviary needed fixing last autumn , the horticulturist and the construction man did it . Seven people run Tiger River ; when it started there were 11 , but as team members learned one another 's skills , they decided they did n't need to replace workers who left . ( P.S. : They 're all Teamsters union members . ) Freed from managerial chores now handled by teams , executives can go out and drum up more interest in the zoo . Any effect on business ? Southern California tourism took some hits in 1991  --  first from the Gulf war , then from the recession  --  but the San Diego Zoo enjoyed a 20% increase in attendance . Part of the reason is price : At $12 it costs less than half as much to enter the zoo gates as it does to get into Disneyland . Zoo director Douglas Myers credits employees ' sense of ownership . Says he : " I told them recession is coming ; we 're going to target our marketing on the local area alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back five times so each time they 'd better have more fun than the time before . The employees came through . " <p>
