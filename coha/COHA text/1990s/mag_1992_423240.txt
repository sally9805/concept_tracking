<p> Lanford Monroe is first and foremost a landscape painter , yet she is a rising star in the firmament of wildlife art . She lives in relative isolation , yet she craves the chance to tap the energies of other creative people . She is restless , an incessant traveler , yet she admits to a powerful " homing instinct . " She is a southern Yankee , a romantic realist , a woman who accepts the discipline of her profession but allows herself to drift with the mysterious currents of curiosity and inclination . <p> Two things are certain : art is the engine that drives Lanford Monroe , and she knows how to paint . Her softedged , contemplative , restrained compositions have won widespread popular and critical acclaim . It seems you can not open a magazine these days without finding an article about her . Sports Afield named her one of North America 's top dozen outdoor artists , placing her in the elite rank of men like Bateman , Carlson and Kuhn . She was featured in the wildlife art book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised her with the words , " truly superior . " Her work has won numerous awards , and the most prestigious show and galleries vie for the opportunity to display it . <p> In Lanford Monroe 's paintings , the boundary between landscape art and wildlife art blurs . Many wildlife artists , in fact , protest that they consider themselves primarily landscape painters . Few , if any , however , can back up the claim from as unassailable a position as Monroe . Her compositions bear scant resemblance to what is typical of the wildlife genre . They depict animals in the same way the eye usually sees them : as half-hidden surprises , emerging silent and unannounced from their surroundings . The animals do not fill our frame of vision , as if you were looking through a spotting scope . Think of it : when you spy a fox following a scent trail across a meadow or watch a deer as it detaches from the timber , the animals are small in comparison to the total sight picture . The animal is but a fragment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , landscape . it has been said before , but you have to search for the wildlife in a Monroe painting . It does not leap out at you . Instead , the animals materialize , resolving suddenly into focus , in the same way their living counterparts do . <p> With the subject occupying at best a supporting role in the overall scheme , the importance of the landscape is magnified . The success or failure of the painting hinges upon the fluency of the total composition , not on the presence of a magnificent leading actor . Put another way , the animal alone is not enough to hold the viewer 's interest . <p> Employing one of her favorite verbs , Monroe describes her current style as something she " just drifted into . " " I did n't consciously set out to paint this way , " she offers . " It 's evolved over a period of years into a style I 'm comfortable with . " As she becomes increasingly absorbed with landscape , does she anticipate a day when wildlife disappears from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happening , " she says . " Wildlife has always been a part of my painting . I do n't think I 'll ever abandon it , no matter what direction I take in the future . " <p> Among Monroe 's many admirers is a man who has known her since she was " a tiny bundle in her mother 's arms , " Bob Kuhn . " Lanford is a very sensitive artist , " he declares , " and a serious student of art . She 's not really a wildlife painter ; I 'd call her a painter of the wild scene , she adds a graceful little touch of wildlife as frosting on the cake . Her paintings are very livable . She has this little furrow she 's plowing all by herself - landscapes with a small , wild touch - and no one else seems to be doing it . I think she 's going to get better and better . " <p> She paints plein-air as often as possible . The directness and spontaneity of this approach have a tonic effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not paint from photographs ( although she has amassed " a world " of reference material ) , and only on the rarest occasions does she make a thumbnail sketch before starting the actual painting . " And when I do , " she laughs , " I 'm the only person who can recognize it . To anyone else , it just looks like a bunch of random lines . " Her usual method is to load up her palette and " jump right in . " Outdoors , of course , she paints from nature , a la the Impressionists ; in the studio , her canvases are composite images , the landscapes of the imagination . It is less critical that the painting suggest a place as that it create and convey a mood . <p> " The mood is the most important thing , " states Monroe . " It 's what I want to capture and communicate to the viewer . I do n't say to myself , ' Use this color it 's moody . ' I look at each painting as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanford Monroe 's success has expanded the definition of wildlife art . in a genre where excellence is still often measured by how " accurately " the bird or animal is rendered , she turns the standard upside down ( or right side up , depending on your point of view ) . Her work demands to be judged purely on its artistic merit , not as two-dimensional taxidermy . That 's the way she wants it . " Good art is good art , " she stresses , " and bad art is bad art , regardless of subject or genre . The same criteria should apply . Wildlife art should n't have a separate set of standards . " <p> By any standard , Lanford Monroe stands out . Enigmatic ? Maybe . Accomplished ? Absolutely . <p> Lanford Monroe 's work is distributed by Sportsmen 's Edge/Fred King Galleries , 136 E. 74th St. , New York , NY 10021 and Trailside Galleries , 105 North Center , Jackson , WY 83001 or 7330 Scottsdale Mall , Scottsdale , AZ 85251 . <p> All painting reproductions courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo : Black-tailed Deer <p> Photo : Algonquin Reflections ( COURTESY L.
