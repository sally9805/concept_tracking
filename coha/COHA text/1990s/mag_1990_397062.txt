<p> PLUTOCRAT BOND-JOBBER SHERMAN McCOY went to pick up his mistress , Maria , at Kennedy Airport . Coming back to Manhattan in his Mercedes roadster , Sherman got into the wrong lane on the Triborough Bridge , entered the nether world of the South Bronx , and wound up enmeshed in that most dangerous and terrifying of all possible circumstances . the plot of a best-selling novel . In The Bonfire of the Vanities , Tom Wolfe expounds upon the theme of Sherman McCoy 's undoing . What was the tragic flaw , the hamartia , as the ancient Greeks would have it , which destroyed this Master of the Universe ? Was it lust ? Pride ? Greed ? Anger ? We say it was a poor choice of car dealerships . <p> The Mercedes SL roadster is small , beautiful , precise , and finely crafted . In other words , the very last thing you 'd want for an automobile in New York City . The Range Rover is a much better choice . <p> People have the Range Rover thing all backwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so , for that matter , do its manufacturers . There 's even a Range Rover model called the " County . " But , actually , it is the little Mercedes SL that ought to be packed with picnic hampers , motored down rustic byways and parked on the grassy verge of woodland ponds with car keys insouciantly left in the ignition . And the SL 's size is an ideal excuse for not taking your children 's friends ( or even your own children ) to the beach house for the weekend . Mercedes has built an exurban vehicle ideal for everything except cleaning out the barn . <p> The Range Rover , on the other hand , is pure urbs in urbe . It is built like a pre-war apartment building , sits **31;30;TOOLONG above the street . Not only will it intimidate those taxi drivers from Absurdastan and Lower Revolta , its massive bumpers can neatly dispose of pesky bicycle messengers . The Range Rover also possesses anti-lock brakes for rapid stops under broken water main and open hydrant conditions , all-too-dangerously frequent in the environs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120 watt , seven-speaker stereo system powerful enough to let you open your windows and give local boom box owners an ear-shattering dose of Handel 's " Water Music . " And the Range Rover interior is rife with burl walnut and Connolly leather . When you 're stuck in the rush hour jams , you can pull out the bridge deck and the watercress sandwiches and  --  presto  --  you 're at the Knickerbocker Club . <p> There is room for society inside a Range Rover , even if those huge Christian Lacroix frou frou dresses come back into style . And there 's space for the fruits of shopping . And  --  one last point not to be ignored in this assassinating day and age  --  the Range Rover is ideally suited in size and construction for the installation of bullet-proof glass and armor plate . 1 At the airport As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " Sherman stood with one hand resting on the door , wondering if he dared leave it here . The car was a black Mercedes two-seat sports roadster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the thing were stolen " . AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> With a Range Rover , Sherman  --  whose wife thinks he 's working late down on Wall Street  --  would n't be worried about having to explain how his car managed to get stolen from a Kennedy Airport rooftop parking lot . Instead he 'd be devoting full attention to the arrival of his slinky partner in adultery , Maria . With its Brobdingnagian exterior and sensible cruising speed , the Range Rover is not likely to attract teen joyrider types ; nor are its discerning owners likely to be snapping up spare parts purveyed by Queens chop shop operators . Besides , the Range Rover is able to accommodate the most elaborate anti-theft and alarm systems . And , if all else fails , there 's room in the back for a Doberman . 2 Stowing the bags As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " The skycap could n't get much of the luggage into the car 's sporty little trunk . He had to stack half of it up on the/Jack seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terrific , thought Sherman . If I have to stop short , I 'll get hit in the base of the skull by matched flying cream-colored vanity cases with chocolate-brown trim . " AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> Hah . As far as the owner of a Range Rover is concerned , Maria could be traveling with the entire baggage train of the Emperor Darius at the battle of Guaugamela. 3 In the cockpit As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " The Mercedes 's spiffy dials and gauges were now lit up like a fighter plane 's . " AS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> Ditto on the spiffy fighter plane-like dials and gauges , but the Range Rover is much better at taking flak from New York potholes , New York traffic , and feral New Yorkers. 4 On the way in As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " He was at the wheel of a $48,000 roadster with one of the most beautiful women in New York . A frisky young animal/ . He took one hand off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " ' There it is , babe/ . Where do you want to have dinner : It s all yours . New York City . ' " AS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> The price of a two-seater Mercedes 500SL is now up to $83,500 . Whereas the most luxurious Range Rover model , with sunroof and sound system , costs $44,100 . If Sherman had bought a Range Rover , he 'd have had an extra $39,400 in walking-around money  --  almost enough to take Maria out to a really nice dinner in Manhattan . 5 The fateful wrong turn As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " ' Sherman ! Are n't you supposed to turn there ? ' <p> " He looked to the right . It was true . He was two lanes to the left of the lanes that led to the off-ramp to Manhattan , and there was no way he could cut across . AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> Superior visibility from the Range Rover 's driver 's seat would have prevented this glitch . Furthermore , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulled his way across the two lanes , taken Maria straight to her upper East Side love nest , ordered-in Chinese , and completely destroyed Tom Wolfe 's opportunity to become America 's leading practitioner of realist fiction . 6 The obstacle As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " It was as if he had fallen into a junkyard <p> " Where are we , Sherman ? ' <p> " We 're in the Bronx . ' <p> " ' You know how to get outta here ? ' <p> " ' Sure . If I can just find a cross street . <p> " He keeps going . turns right . a wide street . What a lot of people all of a sudden . Half of them seem to be out in the street . Puerto Ricans ? . He turned again , and as he rounded the corner- <p> "  --  astonishing . Utterly empty , a vast open terrain . entire blocks of the city without a building left standing . <p> " ' Sherman , I 'm beginning not to like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay . It could happen to anybody , especially if he were distracted by one of the most beautiful women in New York , frisky young animal division . 7 The obstacle surmounted As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " ' Sherman ! Look over there ! It says George Washington Bridge ! . At least it 's civilization ! Let 's get outta here ! ' <p> " He drove across the five lanes . He was back under the expressway . " The ramp looked like a black chute stuck up between the concrete supports . He leaned forward over the steering wheel . A blur in his headlights . It was an animal . It was lying in the road , blocking the way . Sherman jammed down on the brake . it was n't an animal . Treads . It was a wheel . Sherman . opened the door . <p> " ' What are you doing , Sherman ? ' <p> " ' I 'm gon na push it out of the way . ' " AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , Sherman tangled with two young men who either did or did not intend to do him fiscal and corporeal harm . Meanwhile , Maria wriggled over into the Mercedes 's driver 's seat , despite the awkward placement of the gear shift lever ( the one ergonomic disadvantage the Range Rover shares with a Mercedes SL ) . Sherman , fresh from the brush with the law of the jungle that would precede all his other legal troubles , jumped into the passenger seat and : " Maria squealed the car forward . cut the wheel to the left . The rear end fishtailed . thok ! . The skinny boy was no longer standing . " And the plot ( and the comatose skinny boy 's sheaf of medical bills ) thickened . Inexorably . <p> But now , observe the above photograph of the Range Rover o'ertopping an abandoned automobile tire or two . If Sherman McCoy had been driving a Range Rover , he 'd still be a Master of the Universe . Q.E.D. 8 Where were we ? As it happened in THE BONFIRE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just follow the signs . George Washington Bridge . ' <p> " ' Aw shit , Sherman , that 's what we did before ! ' <p> " Take it easy , for Christ 's sake . I 'll tell you where . ' <p> " ' Do n't fuck up this time , Sherman . ' AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> " Kitchy-kitchy-coo . " 9 Ahh . As it happened in THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES <p> " ' Well , what do we do now ? " Said Sherman . <p> " ' What do you mean ? " <p> " I guess we ought a  --  I guess we ought a report it to the police . ' " AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN <p> And they lived happily ever after . Wait a minute . Who is that coming around the corner there  --  all innocence and armloads of Susan Bennis Warren Edwards shoe boxes ? Oh , no . It could n't be . It is n't . It is  --  Judy McCoy , Sherman 's wife , Mrs. Master of the Universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover ca n't protect you . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By P.

O'Rourke is the author most recently of Holidays in Hell . <p> The Art of the Wheel <p> Just because it 's a four-wheel drive does n't mean it has to look like a beast of burden . The curators of the Louvre liked the aesthetics of the Range Rover so much they put one on display back in 1971 . <p> On a utilitarian level , the Range Rover might interest you with a 178 hp , fuel-injected 3.9 litre V8 engine , and the ability to zip from 0 to 60 in 10.9 seconds . The RR 's four-wheel drive will drag you through the snow , while its EPA-adjusted 13 mpg ( city ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the gas station attendants . <p> Physically , the Range Rover stands a massive 175 inches long , 71 wide and 71 high , with a wheelbase of 100 inches . And it 's nice to know you 'll have eight inches of clearance underneath as you drive over pesky urban roadblocks . The RR 's double folding back seat provides room for three when up , and 71 cubic feet of luggage space when down . <p> All the usual comforts are standard , including power windows and doors , front and rear wipers , etc . <p> If you want to get rough with the Range Rover , it comes with a three-year , 36,000 mile full vehicle limited warranty , and a six-year , unlimited mileage , no-perforation corrosion warranty . <p> The regular 1990 Range Rover sells for $39,025 ; the County ( prodigally buried and with such options as " Beluga " black exterior , electric sunroof , and 120 watt sound system ) costs $44,100 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
