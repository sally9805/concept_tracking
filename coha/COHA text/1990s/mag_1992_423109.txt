As a result of that exposure , Wagar has received several commissions to paint murals in her distinctive style , such as a recent commission for a mural for the tasting room of the Landmark Winery in Kenwood , California , which she created using acrylic paints and an airbrush . <p> " I worked out the image in a 21 " - x- 17 1/2 " watercolor painting of chardonnay grapes  --  the only type of grapes the winery uses in producing its wine , " Wagar explains .

" The airbrush was the perfect tool for doing that , even though I had to paint very differently with the acrylics than I did with the transparent watercolors .

" <p> Wagar actually did the painting on three large pieces of canvas ; one section was wrapped around the serving counter , and the other two pieces were butted against each other and attached to the wall behind the counter . <p> Later this year , Wagar 's work will be exhibited at the Buena Vista Winery , where she will serve as artist in residence .
