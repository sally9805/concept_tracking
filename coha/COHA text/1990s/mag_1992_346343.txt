Nothing inspires more confidence in Republican campaign strategists than the belief that George Bush is unbeatable on the foreign policy front . The President can point to the kind of experience that no mere Governor of Arkansas or Texas businessman can claim . Even the imperfect victory over Iraq , which failed to push Saddam out of power , is a Bush triumph in one crucial respect : it achieved the declared aim of ousting Saddam from Kuwait . <P> But lately congressional Democrats are trying to credit Bush with Saddam 's rise as well as his retreat . No fewer than three House committees are looking into the charge that , first as Vice President under Ronald Reagan and then as President , Bush provided Iraq with substantial U.S. assistance that strengthened Saddam 's hand as a regional menace . Even as it became clear that Baghdad was moving to dominate its neighbors , Bush , Secretary of State James Baker and other White House officials urged the Commerce and Defense departments to approve sales to Iraq of sensitive U.S. technology that found its way into Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear bomb . The White House also pressed for federal loan guarantees that encouraged banks to extend credit to Iraq in return for assurances that the U.S. Treasury would pay if the Iraqis reneged . They did . Now American taxpayers are left holding the bag for $1.5 billion in bad loans . <P> North Carolina Representative Charlie Rose , who chairs a House agriculture subcommittee , is looking into why the Agriculture Department 's program , designed to help foreign nations purchase American farm goods , approved most of the loan guarantees . " These loans not only permitted Iraq to feed its people , " complains another House Democrat , Henry Gonzalez of Texas , " they freed up scarce foreign exchange that was used by Iraq to build up its military arsenal . " <P> Gonzalez chairs the House Banking Committee , which last week resumed hearings into whether the Administration is withholding information about U.S. policy toward Iraq . One matter before the committee involves a Justice Department investigation into charges that , in exchange for kickbacks and other payoffs , officials at the Atlanta branch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavoro , made $4 billion in illicit loans to Iraq . Those include $350 million in defaulted loans backed by Agriculture Department guarantees . Christopher Drogoul , former manager of the Atlanta office , is expected to plead guilty this week to charges of fraud and money laundering . <P> The Administration 's critics maintain that it was a sign of White House blindness that it continued to court Saddam even after evidence emerged in the BNL probe of substantial Iraqi misuse of the loan-guarantee program . This week Texas Democrat Jack Brooks , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , will hold hearings on whether to call on the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor to determine if the Agriculture Department 's program was improperly used .
