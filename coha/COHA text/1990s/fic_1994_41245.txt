Another black , pasty morning shrouded the camp . And Nacho , like always , was up early , getting ready for his job as a porter in the library . I saw him with a can of Magic Shaving Powder : he shaved about every fourth day , but the job was a daily thing , and at least twice a week the librarian threatened to write him up over his beard stubble . Usually with a guard present . Finally , he would shave . I never liked that aspect of working , either : just tighter confinement around the rules of prison , like a hat size that was constantly being reduced . <p> But I knew Nacho . He had lived across from me , in the dorm , for close to a year . One of the first things I had noticed were the two teardrops he had , green teardrops , tattooed below the corner of his left eye : each drop represented five years in stir . He also had a large cobra , coiled in the small of his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck . His arms were designed with affiliation symbols , club symbols , and during the lockdowns  --  when separated from his homeboys  --  we sometimes kicked it together . But since I was n't working , I had Nacho get me up that morning for breakfast . He 'd said that the school , across from the library , might be looking for another porter . The plan was to check it out with him after chow . <p> The rest of the dorm just snored contentedly , like apes stretched out in a tropical lull . I lay in bed scratching , not at all eager to work or to hustle up one of their jobs . <p> I knew that porters were a special type of janitor who hung out a lot on the job , after they cleaned and mopped and did the rest of their schedule . They were often contacts between yards , running a sort of messenger service for small favors : no room for scrubs in this line of work . But most of them had been fucked over at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh from the academy , who confused prison with the duties of a high-school hall monitor . Yet Nacho had tried to school me , the previous night . He explained it this way : <p> " Capone , Atwood , all them old gangsters used to be porters . Now you have Crips and El Rukins , Bloods who are porters . " <p> " Yeah ? " I had told him . <p> " Shit , " he said , " it 's an honorable tradition , a tough tradition . " <p> He then leaned a little closer : <p> " I heard that James Brown worked as a porter . The Godfather , ese . A real classy bro in the union . " <p> I had told him all right , I might become a porter , but as usual I was thinking about my own ass . We were in a high-medium institution , and you got fucked around badly if you did n't hire on somewhere . They started by having you rake rocks , on the track by the dorms which enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an amount of " good time " and put you on the shotgun crew . When you told them to jam that crew you were taken off the yard , placed in a higher , super-maximum run , and given a cell with some headcase . I knew there were plenty of nuts around our camp , and felt no need to be on a permanent , lockdown basis with one . So I figured the sensible thing would be to cover myself , to just fart along with the game until I made a lower-security yard . And since jobs meant bosses and authority , I also thought it would be sensible to work as little as possible . <p> It was barely seven o'clock in the morning . Nacho came back wearing blue-striped boxers , scuffling the floor with his shower shoes . He dumped the shaving material on his bed and sat down . Opened his locker . I saw the roll on his stomach , and the old knife wound which glowed like cartilage upon his left side : someone had once caught him from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the other about who had the claim to a job opening . I exhaled sawdust from the last of my cigarette , thinking of breakfast , peeling slowly , at first , from my sheets to get dressed . Our shirts were blue . The air was black . My rug was a towel I had folded under the bunk . And the dorm was freezing when you had hot , Arizona skin . I got into my clothes as quickly as possible , the light from the bathroom like a white frosting on my eyes . I glanced at Grissom , my cellmate , as I tied on my boots . He was all right . He just snored under the hairy , black blanket . Nacho still sat on his bed in his boxers , unfolding T-shirts , his television on . I tucked in my shirt and called him a cold , calloused motherfucker . He put his teeth together and hissed at the wall . <p> " Five minutes , " he said , adjusting the volume on his set . Always this nervous bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " but I need some air . I wan na breathe air again . " <p> " Su aliento huele a mielda , " he said . Your breath smells like shit . <p> " No doubt . " <p> I put my jacket on and went outside , spitting at the trash can that stood near our walk . I glanced at the sky . The world up there was like an asphalt parachute . Rugged , wet charcoal . The yard and the trailers looked worse , like filmed reports I 'd seen of outback Nicaragua . The smarter convicts wore stocking caps , going into and coming out of the chowhall . I drifted , looking for my breath against the clouds . And porters went through this shit every morning ? Nacho came out jacketless , wearing his shades . " Fuck , " he said . " Cold out here . " But all he did was shrug . We footed it the short distance to the chowhall . <p> There was a short line when we arrived . We walked up the cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner to the right . It was spacious , almost elevated in there , though a hundred steel tables were cemented in the floor . Each table was fitted with four attached stools , and glowed under these snarling , length-long fixtures of light . It was like looking at a train of fluorescent cigarettes up there , but the overall feeling  --  with the thirty-foot walls and the ticking echo , the rafter vents and the smell of blower fans  --  was that of being dropped into a huge , Styrofoam cup . <p> I leaned against the half-wall , looking in at the workers on the serving line , watching the pancakes cook behind them on the grill . No , that was n't the job for me either . I still felt about four-inches numb and wanted , in particular , to listen to a woodwind quintet : it was sound that I needed , just a form to balance my rhythms against , but all I heard was an inmate up front who 'd been shorted a container of milk ... by one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here , " the inmate hollered , " I 'll strip the bark from your ass ! " There was a solid panel  --  no glass  --  above the serving window , so the bluecaps could have limited contact with us . They could pretend , for instance , that they were hiding behind trees . The inmate plowed along , out through the turnstile , but only with a partial tray . <p> " And do n't forget my MILK , asshole , " Nacho yelled in when we stepped up to the window . He got his stuff , but I had to reach in , because the bluecap pulled my tray from the ledge and walked off . The guards just stood there , writing down names that they knew the faces belonged to . <p> " Later , " said Nacho , looking across the room . <p> Some of his pardners were sitting upper-center in the chowhall , so I grabbed a table in the corner and agreed to meet him in the library . Breakfast was the time for fruit , cereal , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up sleeves . Various bags were brought in for cereal , which were then crotched or otherwise handled . I took my banana and dropped it through the booster slit I 'd cut in the lining of my jacket . A white guy , decades older than me , set his tray on the table . I sliced at my pancake with a small , plastic Spork . The old guy did n't say a thing . <p> One side of my pancake was tough . The other was mostly batter . It was like chewing a brown leaf that had been coated with paste . <p> dropped it from my mouth grotesquely to my tray . <p> " Who can stand to get out of bed for this shit ? " I asked . <p> I caught this wild , emerald span of oval , when the old guy raised his eyes up to mine . His head was still bent . <p> " They know how to scam a pancake , " he said . " You did n't really expect breakfast , did you ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they know we could eat a whole slaughterhouse . " <p> " Took twenty years for me to choke one of these down , " he said , sporking at the pancakes , " but less than a morning to regret it . Now I just stick to the cereal . You can eat it dry , when the milk 's sour . " <p> His head was still down . I splashed the milk on my flakes . <p> The chowhall guards , like those in the rest of the joint , thrived on this game of lower polarity . Their trick was to block your needs , AS THEY CAME UP , through personal interpretation of the policy manual : raw pancakes . Spoiled milk . It was strictly an authoritative game , based on the idea of depriving the residents . I did n't quite understand it , but one of the advantages to working in the kitchen was being able to pre-step the bluecaps and the guards and to eat , regularly , before the food went bad . But I had long ago learned how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the dish window , hungry , chewing some dry cereal . A green banana slid by on the floor . The guard I passed in the exit ramp said nothing , his chin pointy and angular , resembling a garden trowel . Outside , three other cops looked me over . A thin crack of light divided the sky , and I imagined being trapped under a black beetle 's shell . I went back to the dorm and picked up my cap . Grissom was still sleeping , grinding his teeth , his arms stretched up like a forked branch . <p> Another black , pasty morning . They could go on forever , especially when you started out tweaked . And who really wanted to work an institutional shift , anyway ? I snagged my cap , then walked out into the dayroom . <p> The library and school were located outside the yard , on a restricted and fenced-off section of the camp . You needed a pass from the house cop to get up there . I tracked him down , got one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumpsuits , milled around the west perimeter , waiting for various crew bosses . I looked away from them , no way , and crunched along in the frozen Arizona mud . More residents hung around the South Administration , waiting to get in to see their counselors . Prison counselors were supposed to help you get paperwork and so forth to places like the parole board and the classification committee , though I never saw an enthusiastic-looking face over there . But the turnstile I needed was just off to their left , below one of the gun towers . I dropped my pass into the slot . The guard pulled it in , examining me . She looked down at my boots , yelling through the glass . <p> " Lift your feet ! " she hollered . <p> I showed her my brogans . <p> " Go ! " <p> She pushed the button and I rolled the gate open . I passed through and closed it , watching a cop patrol the North Visitation Center . Three fences beyond me lay five other yards , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Nacho had it figured . I walked along , past visitation , past another locked fence at the edge of the school . I stopped between the school and the library . A sort of divider terrace was cemented between buildings , where a few students hung out , smoking . I glanced through the school window , into the office where the secretary worked : just a short blond in a loose red skirt , cafeteria-plump , talking on the phone . Probably to a cop . Definitely not worth getting out of bed for , every day . I grabbed open the door on the library . <p> Officially , the library was still closed . Nacho and one of his homeboys were sitting at a far table , near one of the few walls that held books , smoking , drinking coffee , bullshitting . The parole board , to my left , was locked . So was the office , on my right . And they were building another wall , an inner door , just in front of where I stood , though nobody was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray with outside light , light that drifted in through the rectangular , back window . Next to Nacho stood an industrial-sized vacuum cleaner The guards were n't around . <p> I walked on the thin carpeting , just as Nacho rose for another coffee . <p> " C'm on , " he said . " I 'll fix you up . " <p> " You know I do n't fix with that shit , " I told him . <p> " Might as well , until Busch gets here . There 's milk , ese . " <p> We hopped over the checkout counter and went into a large room behind the magazine stand . The room had a series of locked , wooden cabinets , and a small window that overlooked the yard . It was cold in there and I felt lost , like a tiny bug on a dark blanket . Nacho opened one of the cabinets with a key , then whipped out a full pot of coffee he had stashed . I suddenly remembered who Busch was , as Nacho poured us a round . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of his ear sawed off with <p> comb ? " I asked . <p> Nacho 's eyes slickened with coffee oil , like he was laughing at a private joke . <p> " Do n't have to let it bother you , " he said in his light , Spanish accent . <p> " You can just mop up . Take care of other business . " <p> " Jesus Christ , Nacho . I thought you were my friend . " <p> " Just do n't pay any attention to him , that 's all . " <p> He handed me a cup with fold-out paper handles . I sipped at the coffee , yawning , certain that the gray dawn was likewise smogging my head . <p> The reason they had squared Busch 's ear off had to do with his thing about queers : he had only a Christian understanding of homosexuality , was loose in the head , and  --  on top of that  --  was n't sure whether he was knickknack or not . He 'd walk up to people and start in on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse , and usually about someone they knew : " I know why your buddy got rolled up , " he 'd say . " They caught him in the supply closet , sucking dick . You ought a be careful , ' cause he 's come on to me . He 's as queer as they come , man , and I just wanted to warn you that he 's always ready to give head . " He would then stare at you with puffed cheeks , forearms extended , the right side of his sunglasses balanced on top of that squared-off ear . Next time , in a group , he 'd be speaking about the lord . And how you can be SAVED IN PRISON if you attend the Bible studies which are offered in the Chapel . A lot of people with strange ideas hid in that Chapel , but with Busch , as he spoke , you felt he 'd want to jack you off with a handful of Bible ink . I just could n't picture myself , alone , in a schoolroom with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chalkboards . And besides , I liked women : they sometimes said funny things when they got hungry , and to me they tasted a lot better . <p> I took a serious step back from Nacho . <p> " Listen , they should have put that guy in the dribble unit a long time ago . How am I supposed to work with a fruit basket ? " <p> Nacho laughed . <p> " Sadistic motherfucker , " I told him , but I also laughed a little . I was getting a short wire from the coffee . <p> " A job around here is a job , " he said , as we headed back to the counter . " A-sides , you 're the one who asked me about it . " <p> " But you 're the one who sold me on it . Just what the hell were you thinking about ? " <p> We hopped over the counter . Nacho said , " I was thinking if you got the job , we could run him off . Only reason I haven't 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it 's a good one , ' cause it starts at fifteen cents an hour . Plus benefits , ese . " <p> " But you know I 'm not gon na step on anyone 's shit unless they crowd me , even his , " I said . " Now what ? " <p> Nacho sat down and kicked his feet up on the table . His homeboy only grinned . <p> " Easy . Fuck Busch . Fuck the crew . Just work the job your own way . " <p> It 's what I would figure , but I knew that these things seldom worked out . Nacho said something in Spanish to his pardoner . They nodded at each other . <p> " Know who was working here when I started ? Little Sulfur Scottie . There was a case for you . " <p> " Oh , yeah , " I agreed , and then thought : every show in this camp is like pulling roots from someone 's head : there 's always a state of pre-existence to transform , in order to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it , or punked-out . I squatted against the wall , looking off into the law library . " All right , " I told Nacho , " who 's the cop that does the hiring around here ? I 'll check it out with him . " <p> " I hear ya , " he said . " Just go over to the school and look around . I think his name 's Colon . " <p> " Officer Colon ? " <p> " Shit yeah , " said Nacho . Even his pardner was laughing . <p> " Fuck an A , " I said . Officer Colon . The perfect man for the job . <p> I set my coffee down and walked to the door just as two residents wearing tool belts swaggered in . Another carried the electric drill . They stopped at that inner doorframe , ready to bolt up the wall . It looked like a loud project , deafening . Then I saw Big Ed , outside . He was leaning against the school . I went over and he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and got a drink from the fountain . The school was just a corridor with six rooms on either side , most of the rooms now filled with students . I could hear the tin of programmed music , softly from the office , but the classroom doors were closed so it was fairly calm , fairly quiet in there . I stood at the bulletin board as a door cracked open down the hall . A cop with a square cap looked out , almost as if he was hiding from someone . It was usually the other way around . I made a slight move , turning my head from the board . The cop 's face was as shiny as a summer squash . <p> " Hey , Colon . " <p> He had large eyeball sockets , and his pupils floated as they rolled over to mine . It really looked like he 'd been drinking from a two-dollar bottle . He just gazed at me , holding the door against his shoulder . <p> " Understand you need a porter , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , pushing the door open . I walked over to the door . <p> Colon was standing in the center of a small , windowless room , which had been converted into an office : institutional books , a calendar on the wall , stuffy . Next to the typewriter sat a stack of incident reports , still blank , just waiting to be filled out . It looked like a trap to me . Colon adjusted his cap , assuming this very superficial tone . <p> " So , you 'd like to be a porter , " he said . " I 'm not in the habit of hiring just anyone . " <p> I thought of Busch , putting his statement to terms right away . I looked him over in the low , pulsing light . <p> " I 'm not in the habit of working just anywhere . " <p> Colon was n't that tall , but his head tapered in . Ears , Christ , pointing out like rudders . His nose cast a shadow , a triangle , on the right side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to whorl before me like a cigar tube . <p> " What makes you think you can cut it as a porter ? " he asked . <p> " I know I 'll work hard for my store money , " I lied . <p> " Tell you what , " he said , in a lingering , boxed accent . " You go over to South Admin and put your name on the list for education porters . You come back this afternoon , after I 've had a chance to think it over . We can then discuss you as an applicant . " <p> " Fine , " I told him . " I 'll get right over to that list . " <p> I looked at him in the room and , as I left , decided against the whole thing . I 'd really only been trying to get out of the morning , but with just a squint of the Colon ( and fueled by the yee-haw of the bluecaps in the chowhall ) I took it further than any cubic , state lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of museum of the reductive : you consistently found people who could do nothing more than meddle with you , simply because they were small . Colon , Busch , tower guards , bluecaps : all became exhibits , to me , of people with lower instinct , of people whose lives fed on a need to reduce and constrain . I 'd need an appointment to get into South Admin and sign on the book . It could take months , and I 'd have to push more cops , including my counselor , to arrange it . Colon , apparently , assumed he could just spin me in all directions , but I now had the high angle and it helped distance me from their worlds : they all led a fractional existence , a melon slice , deathly . <p> The door closed behind me . Colon was on the other side . I relaxed in the hallway , the canals in my head flowing warmly with blood . I saw Nacho outside with a rag and some glass cleaner . I lit up a rollie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , turning back to the window . I liked the way that sounded . <p> " Colon wanted to take me down through it , " I told him , " so I left him in that little closet they use . He 's in there now with the Book of Mormon , waiting on Busch . " <p> " I just barely thought of something else , " said Nacho . " You might be able to work out of maintenance . " <p> " I 'm not cut out to build walls . " <p> I pivoted , just as the secretary came from the school . She was running a handful of papers across the terrace , very official , very red in that skirt , too important to even look in our direction . But fortunately my thinking had a wind of solar flare and I woke up , remembering who I was . Remembering something that could solve my whole problem . I watched as she walked along . <p> " You have an office clerk named Mango ? " I asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd only known Mango a short while . <p> " Jeffrey Mango ? Wears glasses ? " she asked . <p> " Yeah . What kind of hours you have him on ? " <p> " Is there something I can help you with ? " <p> " Not really , " I said . " This is more of an academic matter . " <p> " He 's here in the afternoon , usually no later than one . " <p> " Thanks , " I told her . She opened the door to the library . It sounded like auto shop in there , with all the drilling , the hammering going on . Nacho put his rag to the window , looking in after her . <p> " Culo Pacoso , " he said . <p> " All right , " I told him , " I 've got an idea . No more of this portering shit . No more brownsuits , bluecaps , and especially those graylegs , over in maintenance . The bastards only trick-bag a motherfucker . " <p> " You 're gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm gon na sleep in , if I 'm lucky , " I said . Nacho stepped out of the way . <p> " How 's this window look from back there ? " <p> I looked it over . It was as clear and clean as fifty million FM watts , though it really did n't interest me . <p> " Really tits , " I told him . " Do n't fall in . " <p> Nacho pulled a cigarette from behind his ear , looking proudly at his work . I walked out of there , through the turnstile , past South Admin and the line waiting outside . I wanted to separate from authority as much as possible , hopefully using Mango as my blade . My idea , his execution , something like completing a musical phrase . I looked to the south , to the mountains in Mexico . It was still grisly , tar-like up there , the sky loaded with thick , Mexican clouds . I walked back to the dorm raw-throated , thirsty for salad . I entered my cube . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my bunk , as usual , was like lying in the cup of a plow . I opened to a page , glancing at Grissom . He just snorted and rolled over , like a drugged beast that was chained to the wall . Who the fuck wanted to porter under the obligation of grief ? I aimed my lamp on the book and opened to a page . <p> " Wake up man , chow . They 're gon na close in fifteen minutes . " <p> " Go burn the warden 's dog . " <p> " C'm on , Holmes , they 're serving cheeseburgers . " <p> Grissom tapped on the tubing of my bunk . It hollowed out in my head . <p> " You 're a henroid , Grissom ! " <p> " What 's a ' henroid ' ? " <p> " You 're a henroid , " I said . <p> " Well , I 'm telling you . It 's almost one o'clock . " <p> " All right .... " <p> Grissom was only a youngster , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an ice pick , after a therapy session with his court-appointed counselor . He was then issued to me by the state . <p> I put my feet on the floor and locked up my rack . <p> " Cheeseburgers , huh ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Grissom , " let 's scarf . " <p> " Sure , " I said , standing up . We headed through the dorm . I did n't see Nacho around . <p> " And before you ask , " said Grissom , " neither of us got any fucking mail . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> The dayroom and guard 's cage were dark , but a slit of light shone from the doorjamb . I was ready for the yard . Grissom and I stepped out , into a tremendous chrome October , the sun a horn of silver-blue embroidery . It was hot . I felt like an isolated , solar being . The call over the yard barker said the hall would close in ten minutes but we made it inside , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage , Grissom knocked on the glass . <p> His roaddog was in charge of putting the burgers on our trays . He gave a nod and Grissom laid two fingers , very casually , against the window pane . The dog looked at me , counted the trays in front of us , feeling around for the cops . There was one at the serving window , along with a bluecap whose lips had caked like a dried cheese . Others drifted behind the bluecap , but no one looked over his shoulder . <p> We moved along . <p> Grissom 's roaddog pressed two hamburgers apiece on our trays , passing them quickly to his pardner on the left . The pardner had the lettuce . He reacted coolly , though scrambled , stretching the lettuce across the burgers into a natural , resilient , form-fitting leaf dome . As my tray slid down I walked forward , watching it through the glass . The bluecap pushed it out and I grabbed it , then walked into the center of the chowhall . Grissom 's roaddog had risked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog knew his art . The afternoon was already looking better than the morning . <p> I ate quickly with Grissom . He told me the story of a female cop who had inflated a basketball the previous night in recreation , where he was employed , but I did n't want to hustle work there either . Grissom sort of jutted his whole upper body as he spoke , like he was walled in to a speed-metal sound track . I gave him my cookies right before I left , knowing that he got off on the sugar . The same cops working breakfast were again standing at the door , and as they looked me over I thought of them in their tiny , fractional headtombs . What a way to die death ! I got away from them , fast , and onto the yard . <p> It was a little after one when I got back to the school . Education , like the yard , was now jammed with inmates , but the library was also open . I saw Nacho leaning shirtless against the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benefits . Then Mango came from the school , looking pissed . He took long strides with his short legs , ripping the library door open . I got a smoke from Nacho , waited five minutes or so until Mango came back . This time , he strolled . <p> " Mango , " I said . <p> He looked over . We crossed to the dirt by the fence . Even with good posture he only came up to my chin . <p> " You 're another that looks satisfied , " he said . " Or did I confuse that with disgusted ? What 's new ? " <p> " I should be asking . You sure looked hot a minute ago . " <p> He looked sharply toward the school , then up at the yard . His brown hair was blowing in the afternoon wind . Beyond him lay miles and miles of unwanted state desert . He gazed back , toward the school . <p> " The cop in here complained to the secretary that someone got <p> grade because I did their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The students take the tests , not me , but this idiot Colon thinks he 's busted a conspiracy because I helped someone solve a problem . My boss does n't care , but I do , only because he 's harassing me . And it 's not even his job . <p> We hate each other 's guts . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Yeah , " he said , looking into my eyes . " We got into it another time , over pretty much the same thing . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " I told him to eat shit with tacks through his tongue . I wanted to offend him for being such a punk . " <p> Someone opened the door to the library , and I again heard the plomb plomb plomb of inmate construction . What shit . <p> " He 's only a fraction , " I told Mango , " not a total human being . His thoughts on everything are governed by a fucking state handbook . Makes for some strange reactions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small circles in the dirt with his feet . <p> " A state fraction , " he said . " Kinda funny , when you think about it like that . Still , too bad he 's got ta work up here . " <p> " I figure he 'll be working here no matter what . The next one to come along is pretty much the same formula . " <p> " Yeah , " he agreed . <p> " The exceptions seem to hang back a little , but I 'm sure as hell not finding many . That 's why I need a favor . " <p> " Let 's make it quick , " said Mango . " I 've got to get back before class starts . " <p> I noticed Colon at the door , staring out the window at us . Even here , the fucker wanted in . I turned my back to him . <p> " Register me for drafting , " I said . " Just put it on the computer , so I wo n't get in any jams when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to cut away from this yard , huh ? " <p> " You bet . Can you do it ? " <p> " Sure , " he said . " Tonight , after the shift change . " <p> " Perfect . What am I gon na owe you ? " <p> Mango reached in his shirt pocket , dug out a cassette . <p> " Know John Handle , over on your yard ? Give this to him . " <p> He handed me the tape . <p> " Nothing to it , " I said , and Mango , in his own way , simply walked off . That 's all there was , no pulling of teeth . <p> Drafting . <p> In exchange for a porter-type favor . <p> The afternoon classes began , and Mango headed into school with everyone else . That left me and Nacho , and also his pardner , out on the terrace . But my ass was now covered , and I had no immediate plans . None , whatsoever . Nacho came over with a bag of Mexican hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down long enough that I thought my taste buds had turned to wax , but I nearly jumped from the spice when <p> chewed them . Nacho laughed . His homeboy laughed . We watched as an old , flatbed work truck drove slowly along the perimeter , taking a load of convicts out to a crew site . They stood on the wooden platform holding a single rail , jumpsuits creased in the wind . Colon still looked out from the school : insulated , protected , mindless , dangerous . <p> I turned and walked off . I passed Busch on the walk and said nothing , leaving him and his ear to the regulations of Colon . Good pair , <p> thought , choosing my time , not theirs . <p> Which meant drafting . I knew it would keep me off the street in the mornings . And that was the only thing that mattered . <p> I cut lazily with the tape to John Handle 's . Through the bright , nearly effortless , helium afternoon . <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
