Prices and rental rates vary . <p> ' Dennis the Menace Strikes Again ' <p> 1998 , Warner , CC , priced for sales <p> How much abuse can one man take ? Just ask Mr. Wilson . <p> He 's had enough . Enough of Dennis the Menace . <p> In the direct-to-video release Dennis the Menace Strikes Again , Don Rickles plays George Wilson . There 's guilty pleasure in watching one accident after another befall the belligerent comic . <p> Dennis ( Justin Cooper of Liar Liar ) is more adorable than mischievous . So it 's a little hard to imagine him getting into all these scrapes . Dennis ' first shenanigan is to bring his amphibian collection over to surprise Mr. Wilson on his birthday . The animals get loose , and one ends up in the bathtub with Mr. Wilson . In one of the movie 's best scenes , a frog swims gracefully through the tub and surfaces on Mr. Wilson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betty White is completely nonplussed at Dennis ' mayhem - even when he destroys the birthday cake she has been working on for hours . <p> The plot centers on Mr. Wilson 's post-midlife crisis . He 's old , and he feels it . Especially when Dennis ' youthful Grandpa ( George Kennedy ) comes to visit . <p> Mr. Wilson makes up his mind : He 's moving out , so Dennis ' grandpa can move into his house . <p> The old-male rivalry would have been enough of a story , but in these days of Home Alone , the filmmakers had to throw in a couple of bad guys to suffer at Dennis ' hand . Comedian Carrot Top and Brian Doyle-Murray suffice as a pair of swindlers , although that part of the plot is by far the dumbest . <p> In the end , Mr. Wilson comes around and realizes not only how much he means to Dennis , but also how much Dennis means to him . <p> The casting is this Dennis ' biggest asset . It 's a cute movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV - a good one to watch with the grandparents . 2 1/2 stars <p> ' Phantoms ' <p> 1998 , R , Dimension , CC , priced for rental <p> As his flurry of recent movies show , Ben Affleck has come a long way in a short time . <p> Now the buff , tough action hero of Armageddon , Affleck looked even younger than his years ( 25 ) in this previous release , Phantoms . <p> In it , he plays the kind of role Michael Ontkean assayed in Twin Peaks : a decent , resourceful small-town sheriff who wears a parka and an oversized black cowboy hat . <p> The only problem is , while Ontkean was a good age for such a part ( 39 ) , Affleck looks like he should be doing crosswalk patrol duty in high school , not protecting survivors from an ill-defined monstrosity . He 's so wet behind the ears , he looks like he 's drowning . <p> It seems a small Colorado town is ground-zero for an unearthed , ancient evil that wipes out almost everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source novel , but his plot sounds more like the work of ' 30s pulp writer H.P. Lovecraft . <p> Yet , while Phantoms is creepy and spooky enough , it lacks the classicism of Lovecraft 's work , which was marked by an awe-inspiring sense of doom and dread . This movie is more a standard-issue , jolt-happy fright fest at heart - which is to say , it 's far too simplistic . <p> Peter O'Toole lends a touch of undeserved class as a researcher who 's hip to the problem , and Joanna Going plays an innocent but intrepid woman who stumbles into the trap . <p> As for Affleck , he looks out of his league here , lacking the action-hero image he nailed so well in Armageddon . But the effects are impressive enough , and the film gets the job done within its limited bounds . <p> ' The Spirit of Mickey ' <p> 1998 , NR , Disney , CC , $ 22.99 <p> Disney has been so busy marketing its animated movies - both new ones and the classics - that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . <p> The Spirit of Mickey is a treasure trove of 11 classic Mickey Mouse cartoons .
