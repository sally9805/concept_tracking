During his more than 30 years of turning out literate , suspenseful , best-selling novels , John le Carre has played just about every imaginable variation on the themes of espionage and betrayal . But The Tailor of Panama ( Knopf ; 333 pages ; $25 ) shows that he knows a few more tricks than he has so far revealed . How about , for example , a story of some eager beavers in British intelligence hot on the trail of a conspiracy that does not actually exist ? <P> Harry Pendel , 40 , is the outwardly prosperous proprietor of Pendel &; Braithwaite , Limitada , a gentlemen 's tailor shop that bears on its frosted-glass window the legend PANAMA AND SAVILE ROW SINCE 1921 . Legend seems the right word because Harry thinks he is the only person in Panama City , including his wife Louisa , who knows the falsity of his front . There was no Braithwaite and no establishment on Savile Row . Harry is in truth an ex-con who did time for torching his Uncle Benny 's London garment warehouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His new life in Panama has been made possible by a wealthy friend of the grateful Benny . <P> Into Harry 's shop one day walks Andrew Osnard , a presumed customer who slowly turns into a tormentor . Osnard reveals that he knows all about Harry 's past and nearly as much about his present , especially his investment of Louisa 's $200,000 inheritance in a money-losing rice farm . " I 'm a spy , " Osnard tells the stunned Harry . " Spy for Merrie England . We 're reopening Panama . " <P> Harry does n't see what any of this has to do with him , so Osnard explains . Not only do Panama City 's elite gather for fittings and gossip at Pendel &; Braithwaite ; Harry also personally tends to both the current Panamanian President and the general in charge of the U.S. Southern Command . " You 're God 's gift , Harry , " Osnard says . " Classic , ultimate listening post . " After the carrot comes the stick : " Why blow the whistle on old Braithwaite , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , break up the happy home ? We want you , Harry . You 've got a hell of a lot to sell . All we want to do is buy it . " <P> The trouble is that Harry , bribed and bludgeoned into cooperation , has no idea what he has to sell or what Osnard and his superiors back in London want to purchase . So Osnard drops clues that he picked up from his boss Scottie Luxmore before being posted , on his maiden spying mission , to Panama . He recalls Luxmore warming to the topic at hand : " Not only have the Americans signed a totally misbegotten treaty with the Panamanians  --  given away the shop , thank you very much Mr. Jimmy Carter !  --  they 're also proposing to honour it . " A frightful power vacuum will occur , Luxmore argues , when the U.S. cedes control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians on Dec. 31 , 1999 . " Our task  --  your task  --  will be to provide the grounds , young Mr. Osnard , the arguments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses . "
