If we should press our ears to the ground we might hear the pulsing of a heart . // Once touched by the sweet sentiment of a quilt maker , or the ancient sound of a dulcimer , a part of you never leaves the auburnand-gold Ozark mountains of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri . " It 's a very healing , spiritual place , " says one Arkansan . Such feelings also surround the area 's foodways .

Running a gourmet restaurant in the South 's meat-and-three belt is challenging but workable . " Some look at our menu and are noticeably intimidated , " Miles says .
