<p> As you walk through the woods you are confronted with a babble of clicks , buzzes , whistles , caws and peeps . These sounds are an integral part of the environment and represent only some of the animal languages that we readily recognize . <p> We are no more able to understand these languages then we are able to speak fluently in a foreign country with only a smattering of the language . To begin to understand animal communication we must look past our own facial and bodily expressions to signals involving any or all of the senses . Animals utilize unfamiliar vocabulary , grammar , accents and gestures that involve sound , vision , smell , touch or taste . We must not only be able to recognize these signals but attempt to interpret what the message means to the animal concerned . <p> We can see the power of communication in the dance of the honeybee . The honeybee performs a " waggle " dance for its hive to communicate where a food source is located . The information the bee is communicating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complete dance and in the frequency of the sound bursts produced during the dance . It has been determined that the bee is communicating the angle to the sun that the bees must fly in order to locate the food . The waggle dance is only performed if the food source is between 80 and 600 meters from the hive . If it is within 80 meters the bee performs the less complex " round " dance . <p> Just as we speak with a variety of dialects , so do bees . For example a waggle in Austria may mean food is about 45 meters away , while the same waggle in Egypt means food is only 8 meters away . <p> There are many other patterns of communication found in insects . The on-again off-again light flashes of the firefly , similar in form to Morse code , enable it to communicate at night . These nocturnal insects manufacture their own visual signals with the aid of photochemical equipment at the tip of their abdomens . The messages are achieved through unique patterns of light pulses , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The different communication abilities of crickets , grasshoppers and cicadas proves that voice is not essential for sound communication . Grasshoppers rub their hindlegs against their wings to produce complicated songs , while crickets rub their two wings together , emitting sounds of various durations . Unfortunately the cricket 's song also attracts predators . To counteract this situation , the cricket sings in unison with other crickets in such a way as to jam the frequencies used by hunting bats . <p> The most penetrating insect call is that of the cicada . By flexing muscles , the cicada buckles and unbuckles two hard plates called tymbals on either side of its thorax . The cicada even has the ability to raise and lower the volume of its songs with a special covering that serves as a damper when lowered . It is able to produce ticks up to 1,000 per second - quite impressive to the female cicada . <p> Vocalization in frogs tends to be found mostly in males , but occasionally a female can be found uttering a non-mating call . The mating call is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard in choruses over a distance of many miles . There are also releases , territorial and distress or warning calls . <p> Each frog species has a rather distinct call . Spring peepers have a high bell-like whistle , while the green frog has a dull twang that sounds like a banjo . The wood frog has a duck-like quack and the pickerel frog has a rather short snore . When a strange frog enters a pond , the resident frogs respond strongly to the intruder 's call and react with hostility . in the same manner , birds respond more strongly to the songs of strangers then the familiar sounds of their own community . <p> Birds , on the other hand , communicate quite differently . They have the ability to pick apart bits of their own language , just as we use syntax and words , and use them when an occasion arises . Birds may use songs and calls in many different situations . if there is danger in the area or if help is needed , a bird may only use one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during courtship the songs are much longer and more complex . <p> The warbler has extremely complex songs during courtship , consisting of dozens of acoustic elements arranged and rearranged endlessly to form creative songs that are apparently never repeated . <p> The American woodcock , found throughout New York State , is extremely vocal and has been found to have at least 10 different calls . During the mating season , the male will sound a nasal , buzzing note from the ground that can be described as a peent . Preceding this note is a two-syllable gurgling note that sounds like a tuko . The peent is able to be carried several hundred yards , but the softer tuko can only be heard within about 15 feet of the bird . The woodcock also has a separate flight song to try to attract a mate that sounds like a series of liquid , gurgling chirps . Another call , sounding like cac-cac-cac-cac , is made by the male when defending breeding territory . <p> Every bird has a vocabulary dealing with food . Canada geese talk in low grunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , signal their hunger with little peeps that grow louder as they grow hungrier . <p> However , birds do not always use their voices for communication . Like many other social species , they also communicate with their bodies . The Canada goose uses a variety of postures , just as we use smiles , tears , body postures and hand gestures to communicate feelings . The goose is able to communicate . aggression , threat and inferiority through the use of body language . Birds also talk to each other by darting about in the sky , prancing on the ground , opening their bills and spreading their feathers . <p> All bird songs and actions are part of an inborn language . And even though each species has its own language , it is obvious to observers that they are somewhat able to understand each other . it is through this understanding that they are able to communicate territorial boundaries , danger and other crucial information to other bird communities . <p> For all the musicality or verbal expertise of the birds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found in the mammals . <p> The black bear exhibits numerous facial and body expressions to communicate its dominance and submission to other bears . in addition , bears are very vocal . They whine , snort , roar and bawl . <p> Coyotes , foxes and wolves communicate territorial boundaries by depositing feces or urine on the perimeter . This denotes . ownership and also carries a warning . This display can be used to signal stray animals to the herd or declare one 's presence to the opposite sex . In any case , it is a powerful statement . <p> While hunting , the wolf often uses melodious howls to communicate with its pack , but when the wolf is expressing itself faceto-face it also uses body language to communicate . This pattern of communication is effected by a system of tail postures and facial expressions , used with each other to reinforce the feeling or message . For instance a raised tail and open mouth , showing teeth indicate a menacing threat , while a tucked tail and a wide open mouth indicate complete submission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a closed mouth with upright , alert ears . <p> Primates exhibit human-like communication patterns that continue to amaze us . Even when we are faced with an apparent babble of grunts , squeaks and chatterings , it becomes clear after investigation that their language , is in fact , meaningful and symbolic . Their patterns of communication are much closer to ours than any other creature . <p> When chimps of the same community cross paths , they have been known to greet each other with handshaking , back patting and embracing . These social graces are deeply ingrained in their character . <p> Their language potential is staggering . For example , after years of teaching , Koko , a 230-pound gorilla , was actually taught to use sign language . Distinguished primatologist , Dr. Jane Goodall , was able to communicate with Koko on approaching great apes in the wild . Koko 's advice was to approach in a kneeling or crouching position - advice Dr. Goodall used in Africa . <p> Dolphins and whales , other large-brained mammals , also exhibit a highly complex pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a high level of intelligence and the continual use of their language . <p> The importance of communication between animals can not be underestimated . Through communication , animals are able to concentrate on finding food , avoiding their enemies , mating and caring for their young . The study of communication is a never-ending fascination and a way to learn more about ourselves and the way we express our thoughts and information . Humans are compulsive communicators and although we can not out-smell , out-run or outsee many other animal species , it is through our ability to communicate that we are able to separate ourselves from other species . <p> Illustration : Red fox <p> Illustration : Honeybee <p> Illustration : Chimpanzee <p> Illustration : Grasshopper <p> Illustration : Field cricket <p> Illustration : Black bear <p> Illustration : Woodcock <p> Illustration : Firefly <p> Illustration : Spring peeper <p> Illustration : Blue-winged warbler , Lawrence 's warbler <p> Illustration : Canada goose <p> Illustration : Coyote , Wolf <p> Illustration : Gorilla <p> Illustration : Porpoise <p> Illustration : Whales <p> By Nancy Castaldo <p> Illustrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives in Valatie , She is a previous contributor to THE CONSERVATIONIST . <p>
