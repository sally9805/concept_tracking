Photography not only provided this century with two of the things it likes best  --  greater realism and superior fantasies  --  but also showed how deeply entwined they can be . Circa 1900 , ambitious photographers aspired to pictures that resembled paintings . Then came modernism , which taught them to rethink the characteristics of their own medium .

Of the pleasures cameras give us , the transfiguration of plain reality is the most indispensable . It implies that the world is more than it seems  --  which , after all , it may well be .
