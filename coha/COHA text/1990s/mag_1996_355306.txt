The theatrical question of the moment : Why Martin Guerre ? The tale is flimsy , even for a true legend from 16th century France . A young man deserts his wife and is not heard from for several years ; a man returns and becomes a loving husband ; this man may not be the real Martin Guerre . That 's the story that has inspired an opera , two hit movies ( the French The Return of Martin Guerre in 1982 and the U.S. Sommersby in 1993 ) and a trio of Broadway-style musicals . The biggest of these is the $5.7 million production , from the creators of Les Miserables and Miss Saigon , that opened last week in London . <P> Martin Guerre is the big news and the big disappointment in a London season filled with intimate epics ( all of War and Peace in 4 1/2 affecting hours ! ) , incandescent stars ( a ragged but potent revival of Ibsen 's John Gabriel Borkman with Paul Scofield and Vanessa Redgrave ) , one thrilling biodrama ( Pam Gems ' Stanley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dead pop singers ( Buddy , Elvis and , for Pete 's sake , Jolson ) . <P> Stripping the Guerre story of its suspense , composer Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil establish from the start that the new , improved Martin is a fraud  --  and a godsend to the virgin wife Bertrande . That 's fine ; we want to know why she connives in the deception . But the plot is hoked up with religious pieties ( Huguenots are the new Bosnians ) and a psycho villain desperate to take any Martin 's place in Bertrande 's bed . It 's Romeo and Juliet without the poetry , or an Oklahoma ! that ai n't O.K. <P> Next question : Why do serious musicals have to be so darn brown ? As in Les Miz , earth tones predominate here  --  except in the peasants ' garb , nicely creased and Rinso white . One thing about these villagers : they 've all seen Riverdance ; Bob Avian 's choreography has the heavy-footed agility of that hit Irish dance show . The choral harmonies do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Schonberg 's anthems . But director Declan Donnellan ( who , for his own Cheek by Jowl troupe , staged a superb As You Like It ) ca n't make the drama sing . Guerre is big ; it should have been grand . <P> One last question : Who has learned that size does n't count as much as insouciance ? Why , Andrew Lloyd Webber . His By Jeeves , a radical overhaul of his 1975 flop show , is a delight in miniature . Based on P.G . Wodehouse 's tales of the supreme upper-class twit Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves , a Zen master of irony , By Jeeves has a blitheness that makes the audience feel as if it 's on a holiday from the huffery and puffery of the Boublil-Schonberg musicals ( and of Sir Andrew 's overblown Sunset Blvd . ) . <P> Alan Ayckbourn 's book builds , with deft comic logic , from a tangle of mistaken identities to the climactic remark , " There 's a cat-burgling pig in my bedroom ! " Lloyd Webber 's tunes are inventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads putting on a genial public-school charade . By Jeeves may not be lighter than air , but it 's surely lighter than Guerre . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss/London
