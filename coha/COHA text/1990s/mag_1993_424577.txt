Mr. Clinton 's Trojan Hearse Judged by the likelihood that it will improve the nation 's health care , the Clinton plan looks like a disaster . But perhaps the President is judging by other standards . <p> PRESIDENT CLINTON 'S health-care reform program has been discussed in Congress and the media as if it were a program to reform health care . That is not wholly unreasonable . It will , indeed , change the American health-care system . But as Roscoe Conkling remarked : When Doctor Johnson described patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel , he was unaware of the then unexploited possibilities of the word reform . ' ' And , true to scoundrelly form , Mr. Clinton 's program is less a health reform than a political strategy : a strategy outlined with beguiling frankness by the President 's pollster , Stanley Greenberg , in articles published in The American Prospect in 1990 and 1991 . <p> Mr. Greenberg sought to dispel the pessimism then current about the future of the Democratic Party . It was seen as virtually unelectable , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , welfare spending , and traditional values . Supposedly , it could not abandon its positions without alienating its shrunken but vital base ; and it could not win back the lost tribe of Reagan Democrats if it held onto them . To disprove this , Mr. Greenberg outlined a political strategy for a Democratic victory which I break down into the following five steps : <p> 1 . His starting point was the need to discredit the Reagan - Bush years . This meant emphasizing the deficit above all else , attributing Eighties prosperity to credit that would now have to be paid off , claiming that the benefits of tax cuts had gone exclusively to the rich , and deriding the new jobs created as ill-paid service-industry McJobs . ' Not an easy task , but the political stakes were enormous . As Mr. Greenberg wrote : The battle to define the Reagan - Bush years is a critical political arena where Democrats have the opportunity to disrupt the Republicans ' hold on the middle class , contest again the issue of prosperity . . . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than Mr. Greenberg . President Bush 's aides tacitly endorsed the attacks on Reagan in order to make themselves look good by comparison . On one occasion OMB Director Richard Darman referred in congressional testimony to the Carter - Reagan recession . ' Such thinking was a perfect example of short-termism ' or even now-nowism . ' It neglected the obvious problem that Mr. Bush as Vice President was perhaps the single greatest beneficiary of the Reagan years , Michael Milken not excepted . If the Eighties were discredited , he would be fatally damaged  --  and indeed he was eventually defeated as the champion of an era that never really existed , the Reagan - Bush years . ' 2 . Mr. Greenberg 's second theme was the recovery of America 's economic strength by investment . ' This was not , however , investment as Wall Street understands it , but a respectable New Democrat disguise for the traditional liberal Democratic prescription of taxing and spending . Investment of this kind covered a more expansive role for government , ' taxing excessive luxury consumption , rewarding productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending ' and , of course , social spending . ' 3 . The third theme was hostility to the wealthy because they fail to pay their fair share of taxes . Mr. Greenberg saw here a way to divide the coalition , assembled by the Republicans , between the wealthy and the broad middle class on no new taxes . ' His argument was assisted by the 1990 budget deal which destroyed the GOP 's reputation as the defender of the middle class against taxation . If taxes were going up anyway , why should n't the rich pick up the tab ? 4 . But dividing the middle class from the GOP was only half the solution . There was still the problem of getting the middle class to identify with Democrats . Mr. Greenberg 's fourth theme made a start : emphasize the work ethic , ' strong families and personal responsibility . What he boldly called the new class politics ' required Democrats at least to talk about welfare reform . 5 . But although these themes might break up the Republican coalition and begin the Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough to forge an enduring Democratic majority . That required the fifth theme : Democrats need to rediscover broad-based social policy that sends a larger message : Democrats are for everybody , ' not just the have-nots . ' That means defending and enlarging social-insurance initiatives that reach the lower and middle classes rather than constructing safety nets that protect only the poor . ' <p> For social programs that reach beyond the poor encourage more and more people to become dependent upon the government . Voters gradually become partisans of the programs from which they benefit visibly but which they finance invisibly through general taxation or employer mandates  --  partisans too of the political party that seems most committed to keeping and expanding such programs . As the British Tory intellectual ( and onetime minister for health ) , Enoch Powell , pointed out some years ago : In the welfare state , it is more blessed not to take away than to give . ' <p> Yet the financial consequences of broad-based social-spending programs are horrendous . As John Attarian demonstrated in a recent NATIONAL REVIEW , major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid  --  have risen relentlessly from 25 per cent of the federal budget in 1965 to about half today . As a percentage of GDP , their rise is almost as spectacular : from 4.5 in 1965 to 11.2 last year . And as baby-boomers retire in 2010 - 2030 , the number of workers supporting each beneficiary will fall , for instance from 3.3 in 1991 to about 2 by 2035 for Social Security . <p> Can President Clinton square the circle ? Can he have the political benefits of broad-based social entitlements without the fiscal disaster they apparently threaten ? An impossibility ? A logical contradiction ? Perhaps not . For transfer payments like Social Security , two patches are available . The first is modest limitation of benefits , for instance raising the age of retirement by a few years . The second patch is more ingenious : it is to claw back ' the universal benefits from higher-income beneficiaries through the tax system . Indeed , Mr. Clinton started on this in his budget by raising the proportion of Social Security benefits subject to income tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory pay political dividends . The broad-based system would continue to unite the middle class and the poor  --  while higher taxation on the rich ' ( as defined by the Treasury ) sustained class-war politics . But the margin of advantage is very narrow . If benefits are extended to more people , as political logic dictates , or if the ratio of tax-payers to beneficiaries changes unfavorably , as is actually happening , then taxation has to bite ever deeper into moderate incomes . And that revives taxation as a Republican issue . So Mr. Clinton 's politics of dependency has limited reach while confined to transfer payments . But might it not be possible to have the best of both worlds in a social service that combines broad-based coverage with cost control  --  a new universal health plan , for instance ? <p> The classic example of such a paradox , after all , is the British National Health Service  --  possibly the only popular socialist institution in the world . Admittedly the NHS has all sorts of problems , for instance long waiting lists for non-urgent operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor on the truth that a system which encourages unlimited demand for limited resources must rely on rationing , however disguised ; but on the government for not spending enough . And though Labor as well as Tory governments endure this criticism between elections , the NHS benefits the Left at elections because Labour is more trusted to defend it  --  just as in the U.S. the Democrats gain as the friends of Social Security . And these political dividends are achieved by a program costing less than 7 per cent of GDP . <p> Mr. Clinton seems to have calculated that he can achieve the same thing here . His health-care reform has several points of resemblance to the British system as amended by the Thatcher reforms . ' Both are built around a distinction between providers and purchasers in a regulated internal market '  --  with patients collectively represented by Health Purchasing Alliances in the U.S. and by District Health Authorities in the UK . In both , health expenditure is to be confined within a global budget . And both employ direct price controls . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . But there is one great difference . The British reforms  --  the purchaser - provider distinction , self-governing hospitals , money following the patient , and independent doctors competing with the purchasing authorities  --  were an attempt to introduce some competition , flexibility , and innovation into a rigid structure of bureaucratic administration . The global budget and price controls are the relics of the previous non-market bureaucratic system . <p> Exactly the opposite is true of the Clinton plan . Here it is the global budget and disguised price controls ( i.e. , premium caps and regulated physician fees ) which are the innovations , extending administrative control into an ( admittedly distorted ) market . <p> How is the U.S. hybrid likely to work in practice ? For instance , one of the basic elements in managed competition is a comprehensive health-care package  --  in plain English , a basic package  --  which would be available from every insurer , eligible for tax relief , and crafted by a National Health Board . This would , of course , be a political body quite as subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of mandated health benefits at state levels is any guide , every specialty would lobby to be included in the package  --  and with a chance of success . So the basic package would be a generous and expanding one . Then again , one of our present problems is that patients pay too little of their medical expenses out of pocket  --  partly because most plans have a low deductible . But does anyone see the political process setting a high deductible in the minimum package ? It would be as unpopular as cutting Social Security COLAs . <p> Both mandated benefits and low deductibles will likely boost medical costs . Such pressures might in theory be offset by bargaining between the Health Purchasing Alliances and health providers . But that can only do so much . And downward pressure on prices will be further undermined if the health-purchasing cooperatives  --  the organizations managing ' the competition  --  turn into what Senator Kassebaum has called little HCFAs , ' overregulating the health-insurance market , instituting an oligopoly of HMOs and insurance companies , keeping out innovative competitors , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element : a global budget for health care . This is modeled on the apparent success of the British NHS in holding down health care 's share of GNP . Indeed , it is more ambitious , seeking to contain all health spending , not just the public sector 's . <p> What it ignores is that the apparent British success was achieved by quite drastic measures . During the 1950s , the NHS lived off the capital of private and charitable hospital provision . The first hospital-building program was launched in 1962  --  14 years after the NHS was established . To a lesser extent , this sacrifice of capital to current expenditure occurred through the 1970s . Medical technology , some invented in Britain , was available there later and in less quantity than abroad , e.g. , CAT scanners and kidney-dialysis machines . <p> Secondly , only half of 1 per cent of Britain 's GNP is spent on private health care , compared to 2 to 3 per cent in France and Germany . As a nearmonopoly purchaser of medical services , the NHS could and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thirdly , control of spending is reflected in rationing  --  in waiting lists for some treatments . When limited resources meet infinite demand , they are absorbed either in curing everyday ailments like the common cold or in dealing with the most urgent needs , such as a near-fatal heart attack . But people wait weeks , months , and in some cases even years for hip replacements , operations for varicose veins , and so on . <p> These budgetary decisions are not , however , published as explicit priorities . Some mean longer journeys for expensive treatments . Some close wards temporarily when the budget runs out . Some are communicated to the patient by his doctor 's telling him that nothing can be done '  --  perhaps because the District Health Authority has decided that patients of a certain age will not receive certain treatments . Such covert rationing would be culturally unacceptable and legally questionable in the U.S. even in the public sector . ( Indeed , it is increasingly ineffective in Britain , where health spending has begun to rise sharply . ) And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationing could not be hidden in clinical decisions . Some bureaucrat would have to instruct private physicians to cease giving care when the budget ran out . So a global budget would either become a device for explicit rationing , or be ignored in practice , or be challenged in the courts , or  --  most likely  --  all three in quick succession . <p> Hence the resort to specific price controls such as insurance premium caps or limits on physician fees . But simultaneously controlling prices and increasing demand ( by enrolling 37 million new people in health plans with more extensive coverage ) is rather like trying to hold down the water level in the bath with your hands while keeping the tap turned on . The most it can achieve is to shift costs from the controlled services to those left uncontrolled . As the Heritage Foundation 's Stuart Butler pointed out : When President Reagan tried to control hospital costs , the result was an explosion in uncontrolled Medicare physician costs . ' And something similar happened in Quebec when doctors simply performed more services for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Cold Climate <p> IN SHORT , the hope of a broad-based health-care program with modest financial consequences is a chimera . Insofar as the expenses of such a program are held down , it will be at the cost of rationing and worse service  --  both unpopular . Insofar as the program is broad-based in treatment as well as coverage , it will not control costs . And since 80 per cent of these costs are to be financed by employer mandates and federal subsidies , the program will be a disproportionately heavy burden on small businesses ( many facing health-care bills for the first time ) , occasionally and arbitrarily alleviated by the taxpayer . <p> If the U.S. were the entire world , it could contemplate an uncontrolled rise in broad-based social spending with equanimity , just as the world need not consider competition from Mars when calculating its social costs . But the U.S. has until now been an anomaly in the global economy : an advanced country which holds government spending well below that in sluggish social-democratic Western Europe and therefore generates jobs as rapidly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieved in particular by lighter social burdens on the small businesses which generate most new jobs . Another broad-based social program , expanding demand without any clear idea of how to control costs , would erode that advantage just when the U.S. is facing stiff economic competition from Asia . And this burden would be imposed in order to seduce the middle class into Democratic allegiance by way of dependency on government programs . <p> What should the public-spirited citizen make of all this ?
