<p> A year after she was pummeled in the violence that followed a Ku Klux Klan rally on Martin Luther King Day , Colleen Shea Kelly will return to honor the legendary civil rights leader . <p> She hopes to do it without any fear . <p> " I do n't want to be scared and I 'm not going to cop out , " she said of King holiday events , which start this week and culminate with the formal Colorado observance in eight days . <p> Kelly and a friend went to the state Capitol last year to protest the Klan and - in so doing , they thought - honor King 's memory . Though they came in peace , Kelly and her friend , both white , were attacked by a mob composed mostly of black people in the melee that ensued on East Colfax Avenue . The main perpetrator was convicted of assault and sentenced to prison . <p> This year , despite injuries that left her with memory loss , a scar under her nose and recurring nightmares , she and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She worries that it would be " pushing my luck " to protest white supremacist rallies at the Capitol on two preceding days , but Kelly thinks others should , so long as they protest peacefully . " I know that violent protest ( against white supremacists ) is n't the way to show them because it 's just feeding them and it 's what they want , " the 19-year-old college student said . <p> Others say ignoring rallies by the Klan and Nationalist Movement is the best response . <p> Either way , supporters of the King holiday hope this year will not produce the violence that marred the event in Denver during each of the last two years . <p> And they say they have reason for optimism . <p> The King march and the two anti-King holiday rallies are on different days . That 's because organizers of the official state holiday were first in line to apply for a permit to use the Capitol grounds on the Jan. 17 holiday . They arrived ahead of Shawn Slater , Colorado organizer of the Knights of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will assemble at the state Capitol and walk to the statue of King in City Park . That reverses the traditional direction of the march , which used to end up downtown , near the Klan demonstration . <p> Protest demonstrations <p> After holiday organizers won the Capitol permit for Jan. 17 , Slater obtained a permit for this Friday to protest the King holiday . The Nationalist Movement , another white supremacist organization , has reserved the Capitol grounds next Sunday to rally both against the King holiday and for the " principles of Amendment 2 , " an anti-gay-rights measure . <p> Still , unlike 1992 and 1993 , the Klan will not be able to rally at the Capitol on King Day . <p> " I do n't think we 're going to see the problems we 've seen in the past , " said Denver police Patrol Division Chief Tom Sanchez . <p> He said the police presence at the long weekend of King-related events will be reduced compared to the two previous years . <p> Even as supporters of a peaceful King holiday express optimism this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an epicenter of violence during the event in 1992 and 1993 . <p> Alan Minton , chief of staff of the Atlanta-based Martin Luther King Jr . Federal Holiday Commission , said the intensity of Denver 's King holiday-related violence is unusual . <p> Last year , Kelly and two others were beaten outside Argonaut Liquors , 700 E. Colfax Ave. , when the riled mob dispersed after the Klan 's midday rally . <p> In 1992 , hundreds of angry protesters against the Klan rampaged through tear-gas-shrouded streets around the Capitol , vandalizing police cars , attacking a bus carrying Klan members , fighting and pelting police with rocks , bottles and snowballs . <p> " You just do n't think of Denver as a city with any sort of racial problems , " said Minton . " I ca n't figure it out . " <p> According to Minton , Colorado was among the first 17 states to enact a law creating a King holiday . It was recognized officially in Colorado and the nation in 1986 , and the magnitude of Denver 's King birthday celebrations " stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Backlash possible <p> Some say Denver 's King holiday may be a victim of its own success . <p> The Rev. Gil Horn , co-pastor of Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church and , until recently , executive director of the Colorado Council of Churches , says a positive racial climate in Denver and the city 's extensive King celebration have created a backlash among those " who find it threatening . " <p> Others think the chaos of 1992 created a precedent , making it an appealing annual target for white supremacists and people looking for an excuse to cause a disturbance . <p> " Now you have the tradition of some sort of disruption , and even if ( Klan organizer ) Shawn Slater were not here there would be others who would try to perpetrate that sort of disruption , " said Norm Early , former Denver district attorney . <p> One of the few points that the Klan and its opponents agree on is that most of those responsible for the violence on the King holidays did n't come to celebrate King . <p> " There are fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disruptive in the universe no matter what the occasion is , " said Fabby Hillyard , a member of the Martin Luther King Jr . Colorado Holiday Commission . <p> Neoal Hayes , a gang member convicted of attacking Kelly and her friend during the 1993 melee , was described by the judge who sentenced him to 24 years in prison as " evil and morally depraved . " <p> Slater says : " It 's your hooligans who are just out there to cause problems . They 're not there for King , they 're not there for us . They 're solely out there to cause problems . " <p> But that does n't mean the Klan does n't appreciate the presence of troublemakers . <p> " There are benefits either way , " admitted Thomas Robb , the Klan 's national director . " Obviously if there 's violence by some protesters there 's a benefit for us as far as publicity . If there 's no violence , there 's a benefit from that also because people will be more apt to come out for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests at the courthouse in Pulaski , Tenn. - birthplace of the Klan - since 1986 . But after several years , the Klan began to de-emphasize Pulaski as a King protest rally , promoting it instead as a national Klan " homecoming , " Robb said . <p> As a result , Robb began to look for other places to hold anti-King rallies . Slater proposed organizing one in Denver . <p> Robb was intrigued because he had wanted to move the protests into major cities outside the South , traditionally seen as the Klan 's strongest territory . <p> Besides Pulaski , Denver was the only anti-King holiday rally organized by the Klan in 1992 . <p> Last year , there were anti-King holiday Klan rallies in Austin , Texas , and Montgomery , Ala. , as well as Denver . This year , according to Slater , Denver will be one of eight cities nationwide with anti-King rallies by the Klan . <p> Although edged out in the race to reserve the Capitol grounds on Jan. 17 , Slater said the Klan has " talked about " walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still up in the air , " he said . <p> Separate plans <p> The Nationalist Movement has plans of its own . The organization is led by Richard Barrett , a New York City-born , Mississippi-based lawyer . <p> Barrett was quoted by Newsday in 1989 as calling for " repatriation - Jews to Israel , Puerto Ricans to Puerto Rico , Negroes to Africa , Orientals to the Orient and so forth . " <p> He shied away from such statements in an interview last week , preferring to talk about his platform of " the greatest good for the greatest number " and " favors for none . " <p> Barrett will not say how many members the Nationalist Movement has , and when asked how many people would attend his rally in Denver he would only say : " I know I 'll be there . " <p> Despite the plans of Barrett and the Klan , King holiday supporters remain hopeful that their celebrations will be unaffected . <p> While most concentrate on the what they see as logistical improvements over previous years , the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Denver metro branch , has another theory as to why there is reason for hope . <p> " Denver is just fed up with violence , " Tillman said . People will " forget the Shawn Slaters of the world , just for one day of peace . "
