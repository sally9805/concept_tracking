Section : CANCER PREVENTION Here 's Prevention 's strategic lifestyle plan to help you stop Public Enemy Number Two <p> Lung cancer has long been Public Enemy Number One on the NCI 's ( National Cancer Institute ) Most Unwanted List . And thanks to more than a quarter-century of warnings , most of us know how to avoid becoming one of its victims . But quick  --  who 's Public Enemy Number Two ? In terms of yearly death toll , that dubious distinction is claimed by colorectal cancer . <p> Except for the publicity surrounding then-President Ronald Reagan 's operation in 1985 , you may never have heard of colorectal cancer . That silence is deadly . Researchers think that alarge proportion of all colorectal cancer cases can be prevented if people make a few simple lifestyle changes . Many of the changes are things Prevention has been telling you all along . <p> " Fewer than 8 percent of all cases of colorectal cancer can be traced to inheritable genetic factors , " says Nicholas J. Petrelli , M.D. , chief of surgical oncology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heart disease and some other cancers ( breast and prostate , especially ) have been dubbed " Western diseases " because the whole lifestyle of industrialized nations puts people at increased risk . In studies of colorectal cancer , the Western diet is implicated above all other factors . Common sense backs that up , too . After all , the colon is in direct and prolonged contact with the results of a bad diet . <p> Here 's a rundown of the factors that must be dealt with in your colon-cancer defense plan : THE FAT LINK <p> Research reveals that high-fat diets are associated with higher risk of colorectal cancer , and low-fat diets are generally linked to lower risk . And science has discovered why . <p> " The Western diet contains far too much fat . That has a direct effect on carcinogenic changes in the colon , " explains Peter Greenwald , M.D. , director of cancer prevention and control at the National Cancer Institute . Fat itself is n't carcinogenic . But research shows that it sets off a chain reaction in the digestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fat stimulates the release of bile acids from the gallbladder . Fat and bile travel through the small intestine and are dumped into the colon , where a certain type of bacteria converts bile acids into chemicals known ( logically enough ) as secondary bile acids . " These secondary bile acids are co-carcinogens . They can produce changes in the intestinal walls that , over time , lead to cancer , " says Dr. Greenwald . <p> But on a low-fat diet , the chain breaks down . Small amounts of fat cause the gallbladder to secrete only a small amount of " primary " bile acid . Less acid may make the inside of the colon more hospitable to aerobic bacteria , a type of bacteria that ca n't alter bile . Anaerobic bacteria ( the type that can convert bile ) do n't flourish , so only very small amounts of secondary bile acids are produced . <p> But a high-fat diet sends the gallbladder into overdrive . Excess bile pours into the colon , allowing the anaerobic bacteria to crowd out their neighbors . Researchers suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids are produced and tend to irritate the lining of the colon . Both of these events may set the stage for cancer . <p> " Our research , however , shows that you can lower levels of secondary bile acid quickly and dramatically on a strict low-fat diet , " says Stephen B. Inkeles , M.D. , director of clinical nutrition and a staff physician at the Pritikin Longevity Center , in Santa Monica , California . <p> Pritikin researchers have an ideal arrangement for testing the effects of fat reduction . People come to the Longevity Center specifically to modify the dietary and exercise habits that are linked to certain cancers , heart disease and diabetes . <p> Secluded for several weeks at a time , they 're put on a very-low-fat diet ( 10 percent of calorie intake ) and taught how to maintain it through careful food selection and preparation . They undergo a battery of tests as part of the program , and most are willing to cooperate in additional studies . <p> In one of those studies it took a mere 26 days to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center , 11 middle-aged women had been eating a diet averaging 34 percent of calories from fat ( the national average is about 40 percent ) . For the 26-day experiment , they were fed a diet averaging 7 percent of calories from fat . <p> One year later , tests showed the women 's secondary-bile-acid production was still slightly below 50 percent of the original levels  --  even though their dietary fat intake went up to an average of 14 percent after returning home ( Preventive Medicine , volume 17 , 1988 ) . <p> What does all this mean to the general public , whose fat intake is notoriously high ? The current NCI recommendation is to " reduce fat intake to less than 30 percent of calories . " <p> But how low should you go ? In the past , Prevention has recommended a 25 percent level or below . ( All " Prevention Cuisine " recipes meet this guideline . ) And indeed some scientists suggest that the optimum level is 20 to 25 percent . " The amount of your risk reduction seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " says Dr. Greenwald . <p> Increasing the amount of fiber in your diet may be the second most important action you can take to lower your colorectal cancer risk . For awhile , some researchers thought this was just another way of saying reduce fat , since most high-fiber diets are filled with low-fat plant foods . But telltaleresearch , especially studies from Fin-land , changed their minds . Overall fat consumption in Finland equals or exceeds that of most other industrialized nations . Their diet is especially high in saturated fats . But the Finns also eat a lot of whole-grain , high-fiber foods . Compared to the United States , heart-disease rates are higher in Finland , yet they have only one-third our risk of co lorectal cancer . <p> Scientists believe that fiber lowers colon-cancer risk by actually changing the environment and workings of the colon . It bulks up the stool with itsown weight and the water it absorbs along the way . This has several direct effects . First , it physically dilutes the concentration of secondary bile acids and other potential carcinogens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intestines , decreasing the time the colon wall is in contact with any potential carcinogens . Third , fiber increases the acidity of the colon , making it less hospitable to bile-acid-altering anaerobic bacteria . A variety of studies have tried to identify the best sources of fiber for colorectal cancer prevention . Preliminary results on humans and lab animals suggest that wheat bran and rye bran are most effective . " However , it 's counterproductive to split hairs based on current results . The most important thing the public can do is increase their overall dietary fiber intake from a variety of natural food sources , " advises Bruce Trock , Ph.D. , a cancer epidemiologist at Fox-Chase Cancer Center , in Philadelphia . <p> The average American consumes a bare 11 to 12 grams of dietary fiber per day . The NCI guidelines say we should increase that to 20 to 30 grams per day . " You 'll be on the right track if , for example , each day you could eat a bowl of high-fiber cereal , three slices of whole-grain bread , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Trock counsels . " It 's difficult to get too much fiber from natural sources . " <p> High-fiber fruits , vegetables and grains are packed with nutrients that may help decrease many disease risks . ( Fiber supplements do n't have these added benefits . ) <p> If you 're not used to a high-fiber diet , you should gradually increase your " dose " over several weeks , as well as increase your water intake . If you were to suddenly double your intake , you could experience cramps , diarrhea and other digestive discomforts . So be sure to go slowly . THE OVERWEIGHT RISK <p> Several population studies have shown a link between obesity and increased colorectal cancer risks . Of course , this may be related to diet . <p> Overweight people in these studies may have eaten more fatty foods than thin people . But there 's also sufficient evidence that hormonal changes caused by obesity could raise colorectal cancer risks on their own , independent of diet . <p> In one study of over 800 people , diagnosed cases of colon polyps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing weight . Women seemed to be at greater risk than men , which is not entirely surprising . Breast and endometrial cancers have also been linked to obesity ( Journal of the National Cancer Institute , March 6 , 1991 ) . <p> It 's not certain how much extra weight is too much for your colon . But if you 're clearly overweight , reducing will lower more than your colorectal cancer risks . THE CRUCIFEROUS CONNECTION <p> As you increase your vegetable intake , be sure to include several servings from the cruciferous family of plants  --  broccoli , cauliflower , cabbage , bok choy ( Chinese cabbage ) , brussels sprouts , turnip , rutabaga , watercress and some of the new hybrids like broccoflower and orange cauliflower . <p> The reason ? These vegetables contain high levels of indole glucosinolates  --  compounds that are believed to have a variety of cancer-fighting effects . In preliminary animal studies , indoles seemed to block carcinogenic changes in the colon and other organs . Of course , more research needs to be done , but there 's enough evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An important footnote . Boiling can leach about half of the indoles out of vegetables . That 's a good reason to eat them raw whenever possible . THE CALCIUM GAMBIT <p> There 's preliminary evidence that certain vitamins and minerals may influence colorectal cancer risk . The most promising of these is calcium . " There are tentative findings that link higher levels of calcium intake with lower co- lorectal cancer risk in humans , " says Martin Lipkin , M.D. , head of the Irving Weinstein Laboratory for Gastrointestinal Cancer Prevention at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . " Like fiber , calcium seems to bind bile acids , which prevents them from irritating the colon wall . " <p> Laboratory studies have shown that calcium may have another valuable effect . In test tubes , calcium is able to slow the reproduction of immature cells taken from the colon wall . It also increases the maturity of many types of cancer cells ( so they die off faster ) and slows excessive cell growth . Population research indicates that daily calcium intake at or above 1,200 milligrams is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intakes fall considerably short ofthe mark . THE RIGHT MOVES <p> One nondietary factor seems to play a moderate role in colorectal cancer incidence : physical activity . " People who are inactive seem to be at greater risk than those who are active in either their work or leisure time , " explains Rachel Ballard-Barbash , M.D. , nutrition advisor , office of disease prevention and health promotion , Department of Health and Human Services . <p> In one study , men who scored in the lowest third of a physical activity rating had nearly twice the risk of colorectal cancer as the most active group ( Cancer Research , June 15 , 1990 ) . Chinese-American men who reported sitting an average of 10 or more hours per day had four times the risk of men who sat less than five hours a day ( Journal of the National Cancer Institute , June 6 , 1990 ) . <p> So far , researchers have n't made any firm recommendations about exercise and colorectal cancer . A common-sense approach is best . If you do n't get a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If sitting for long periods , make an effort to take a few breaks to stretch your legs . <p> <p> SOURCES : Rachel Ballard-Barbash , M.D. , nutrition advisor , office of disease prevention and health promotion , Department of Health and Human Services ; Paul Engstrom , M.D. , medical oncologist and director of the cancer prevention and control program at Fox-Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia ; Peter Greenwald , M.D. , director of cancer prevention and control at the National Cancer Institute ; Stephen B.

For a man weighing 160 pounds with a calorie intake of 2,200 , 62 grams is the guideline . ( See " A Beginner 's Guide to Cutting Fat , " August 1991 . ) Reduce red meat intake ; substitute skinless poultry and fish . Eat at least two servings of fruit and four servings of vegetables each day . Eat at least four servings of fiber-rich grain products ( like whole-wheat bread or bran cereal ) daily . Include regular servings of raw cruciferous vegetables ( like cabbage , broccoli , cauliflower ) . Include regular servings of calcium-rich greens ( virtually all but iceberg lettuce ) or legumes ( kidney , soy or navy beans , chick-peas ) . Switch to nonfat or low-fat , high-calcium dairy products . Take a half-hour walk once a day . If overweight , reduce to within 10 pounds of your ideal weight . If over 40 , visit your doctor for regular cancer-screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreased your risk of colorectal cancer through lifestyle changes , the most important action you can take is to get tested as you get older . The five-year survival rate of patients whose cancer is caught in an early stage is 85 percent . It drops to 55 percent when the cancer starts to spread . That 's a very good reason to get tested regularly . <p> Here 's an even better reason . Screening can also detect polyps , which are tumorlike growths on the interior wall of the colon . Polyp growth can be triggered by genetics or by irritants in the colon ( like bile acids ) . Many polyps are benign . But some , known as adenomatous polyps , can undergo cancerous changes after they grow to a certain size  --  a process that takes at least five years . Since current tests can detect polyps long before that , doctors have an excellent chance of stopping colorectal cancer before it starts . <p> Who should be screened for colorectal cancer ? Anyone at high risk . . . which means everyone , sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 . That 's the age some people begin to form polyps , although actual cases of cancer are rare . After age 50 more rigorous screening is recommended , since 93 percent of all colorectal cancers occur in people past the half-century mark . Without dietary modification , the average American 's lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 6 percent , which means about 1 out of 20 will be diagnosed with the disease . People with a family history of colorectal cancer . If it was a close family member ( parent , sibling , aunt , uncle or grandparent ) , your risk increases three to four times . People with chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn 's disease . These ailments cause inflammation of the colon , which contributes to abnormal cell growth and polyp formation . Cancer risks are especially high if the disease develops during childhood , persists for more than 10 years , involves the entire colon and is continuous rather than intermittent . Depending on the severity of the disease , their risk is 5 to 11 times greater than normal . People who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These folks should be screened regularly for possible recurrence of the disease . The National Cancer Institute recommends three methods of screening people who have no symptoms of colorectal cancer , but may be at risk : 1 . All adults over 40 should have a digital rectal exam performed during a routine physical or gynecological checkup . The doctor simply checks the interior surface of the rectum with a gloved , lubricated finger . The advantages : It 's inexpensive , easy to perform , and far less uncomfortable than other invasive tests . The disadvantage : Limited effectiveness  --  only 12 to 15 percent of cancers occur in tissues the doctor can feel during a typical exam . 2 . Once a year starting at age 50 , all people should be tested for hidden blood in the stool . The most common method is the hemoccult test , which can be performed at home or in a doctor 's office . It requires the collection of a small sample of feces , which is chemically tested for hemoglobin . A positive hemoccult test does n't necessarily mean cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benign polyps or certain foods . <p> Anywhere from 1 to 5 percent of all hemoccult tests are positive . Only 10 percent of those people actually have cancer , and another 20 to 30 percent have precancerous polyps . The hemoccult is the best non-invasive test currently available . You can increase the accuracy of the hemoccult test by watching what you eat beforehand . Do n't dine on the following foods for at least 24 hours before taking the test : Red meat , including beef , pork and lamb . The residue of blood in these meats can cause a false positive . Cantaloupe , and any of these in uncooked form : broccoli , cauliflower , cucumbers , parsnips , red radishes , horseradish , potatoes and mushrooms . These foods contain the enzyme peroxidase , which can cause a false positive . Iron supplements and laxatives may cause a false positive or a false negative . Vitamin C supplements , which can cause a false negative . 3 . Beginning at age 50 , and every three to five years after that , the NCI recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiberoptic tube called a sigmoidoscope . This is the best of the primary screening methods because it allows the physician to check the area where 60 to 70 percent of all cancers occur . Newer , flexible sig- moidoscopes make this test easier on physician and patient . Sigmoidoscopy is uncomfortable , but rarely painful . Best of all , it 's accurate . <p> THE WARNING SIGNS OF COLORECTAL CANCER <p> Call your doctor for a checkup if you have any of the following symptoms for more than two weeks : Changes in bowel habits , such as sudden constipation or diarrhea with no apparent cause . Very dark , mahogany red or bright red blood in or on the feces . Persistent abdominal discomfort . An unusual narrowing of the stool . An urgent , painful feeling that you need to defecate . A feeling of incomplete emptying after a bowel movement . Unexplained weight loss , anemia or fatigue . <p> Some of these warning signs may indicate other diseases or may mean nothing serious , but only a physician can make that judgment . If you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the disease and the most up-to-date treatments from the nearest NCI-approved treatment center by calling ( 800 ) 4-CANCER . <p>
