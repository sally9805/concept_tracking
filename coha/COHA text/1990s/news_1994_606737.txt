<p> The USAir plane that crashed July 2 at Charlotte , N.C. , killing 37 people , hit a violent wind shift that it probably could not have survived , according to sources who have seen investigative data that will be released today . <p> But weather will not be the focus of National Transportation Safety Board hearings starting today in Charlotte so much as the question being asked by the government , the aviation community and airline officials themselves : Why have five of the last seven major U.S. airline crashes , including the Sept. 8 crash near Pittsburgh that killed 132 people , involved USAir ? <p> Board investigators in Charlotte are likely to concentrate as much on the performance and decision-making process of the two-man crew flying the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 as on the specifics of the violent wind shift , known technically as a microburst wind shear . <p> On a broader scale , it seems certain that USAir 's training , procedures , discipline and even its corporate attitude will undergo a hot-light examination this week . <p> The Charlotte hearings come 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh . The hearings will examine , among other things , these questions about the July crash : <p> * Why did the captain and first officer , both of whom survived , take their aircraft to a point from which they could not recover ? <p> * Why did they continue the approach into deteriorating weather before they attempted to abort the landing ? <p> * How aware were they made by air traffic controllers of the weather 's severity , and what did they see on their own ? <p> * Did they follow USAir policies and procedures ? How good was their training ? <p> * Finally , how applicable are these issues to the other USAir accidents ? <p> USAir Chairman Seth E. Schofield said the five accidents were " very dissimilar , " and " we have looked at this every conceivable way , both internally and with some external help , and no one has been able to find one thread that would connect " them . <p> Dozens of government officials , human factors specialists and pilots interviewed for this article also said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the most part , they praised USAir 's dedication to safety and its willingness to cooperate . <p> But the hearings , coupled with the crash of Flight 427 at Pittsburgh , are likely to have a depressing effect on a company that is already experiencing significant financial difficulty . Company officials say they wo n't have a clear picture for another few days , but there are signs that the loss in revenue from travelers leery of USAir could be considerable . <p> From 1989 through the second quarter of this year , USAir has had an almost unbroken string of losses totaling $ 2.6 billion . Schofield said in June that the company will have to cut $ 1 billion from its annual operating costs if it is to survive vigorous new competition from low-fare carriers . <p> The Federal Aviation Administration stepped up surveillance of USAir 's operations , maintenance and training several years ago when the airline first ran into financial difficulty , and the agency has renewed the intensity of that effort since the Pittsburgh crash . <p> Daniel C. Beaudette , FAA deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that could explain the airline 's string of crashes . <p> " There 's still no indicator , no trends , no systems sort of things , " he said . " We do n't see any threads . " <p> " At least four of the five could have occurred no matter whose name was on the tail , " said Kelly Ison , 35 , a 737-300 copilot who has worked for USAir for six years . " A good bit of this is just randomness . " <p> But human factors specialists caution against assuming that the accidents are random and unrelated . They insist that one must examine the possibility of a human performance thread along with other factors because the five crashes seem to have no common operational or mechanical problems . <p> Beaudette said the FAA will " take some additional steps " in its surveillance of the airline and probably will concentrate more on adherence to standard procedures and cockpit communication . The five crashes that have caused this concern : <p> * On Sept. 20 , 1989 , USAir Flight 5050 skidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East River in New York . The crew failed to notice that rudder controls were improperly set , then became so confused as the plane roared down the runway that for a few seconds no one was in control of the plane . <p> * On Feb. 1 , 1991 , USAir Flight 1493 collided with a commuter plane as it was landing at Los Angeles International Airport , killing 34 . It was a nighttime accident and air traffic controllers had cleared the small plane onto the same runway 2 1/2 minutes before the USAir plane attempted to land . Although most of the blame fell to the air traffic controllers , the safety board found traces of legal medication in both cockpit crew members . The board said this did not contribute to the accident , but " it indicates a less than complete appreciation of the potential dangers that the unauthorized use of such medications may pose . " <p> * On March 22 , 1992 , USAir Flight 405 crashed on takeoff from La Guardia . The plane had ice on its wings . Industry de-icing practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash , but the board said that inadequate communication and procedures in the cockpit led the pilots to take off too quickly and at too high an angle . <p> * The Charlotte crash , with human performance certain to be a part of this week 's hearings . <p> * The Pittsburgh crash , the cause of which is still unknown . <p> As aircraft and jet engines have become more reliable , attention has shifted to human factors . Pilot training has been revolutionized in the past decade with the advent of " crew resource management " ( CRM ) training designed to teach pilots to communicate clearly and to speak up to ranking crew members when necessary . <p> USAir came late to CRM , but its three-year-old program has drawn praise . It is possible that if there is a human factors thread in the crashes , USAir already has started to work on the solution through that program and a follow-up investigation just starting . <p> Following the Charlotte crash , USAir decided to send teams of selected USAir pilots and other specialists into cockpits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of the joint USAir-Air Line Pilots Association safety committee said an effective safety program does n't concentrate just on accidents , but " we have to look at how we handled what almost happened . " <p> USAir also has sent teams to other airline training centers to determine how they handle training and procedures . <p> In 1989 , the Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. reported in Flight Safety Digest , the magazine of the Flight Safety Foundation , that it had found a clear trend in a survey of the airlines with the best flight crew safety records . <p> It boiled down to top management insistence on standard procedures and discipline in the cockpit  --  flying " by the book "  --  enforced by tough " check airmen " who inspect crews , with tightly controlled cockpit procedural language and firm requirements for in-depth takeoff and approach briefings between captains and first officers . <p> That conclusion was backed up by another Flight Safety Foundation study by airline Capt . Thomas A. Duke in 1991 that said , " When dealing with aircrew errors that occurred near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural behavior or decision-making factors . " <p> Schofield dismissed any notion that USAir is lax in enforcing " by-the-book " procedures . <p> " I would put our programs against anybody 's in our adherence to good operating practices and procedures , " he said . " I just do n't buy the notion that a check airman , realizing his responsibility , would be too kind . It 's just not done , not done . " <p> Airline mergers play havoc with standard procedures because they combine different pilot cultures . USAir discovered this in 1989 when its merger with Piedmont Airlines created animosity and resentment between the two groups of pilots . The Piedmont merger was only the most recent of many in USAir 's history . <p> Through its " mirror image " program , USAir melded the different cultures , and Schofield said that task has been completed . <p> Clay Foushee , vice president for flying operations for Northwest Airlines , which also once suffered from a coalition of different pilot cultures , said the process is " long and involved and acrimonious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors research at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and at the FAA , said the only way to combine cultures is to develop common procedures and to strongly enforce them . <p> Foushee would not discuss USAir , but he said that , contrary to popular notion , no one should assume that any airline 's financial problems or crashes would automatically take an edge off safety . <p> " There 's a term in psychology called fear and affiliation , " he said . " If you 're a culture going through a common scary experience , it draws you together . That 's certainly happened here . " <p> There are indications it is also happening at USAir . The airline 's collective internal trauma may propel management and employee groups to reach accord on badly needed cost savings . <p> Half of the needed $ 1 billion in cost savings was to come from labor . But not all union members share Schofield 's sense of urgency and the airline 's unions quickly split , with lower paid mechanics and flight attendants saying higher paid pilots should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh crash , which deeply shook the airline 's employees , seems to have broken that impasse , and the unions began talking to each other again this past week .
