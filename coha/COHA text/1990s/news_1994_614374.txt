<p> Athens - For most of the year Athens is the center of the universe for students , football fans and wannabe rock stars , but in these last days of August it drowses , a college town with nothing much going on . Summer students at the University of Georgia are gone , and the bars and cafes are quiet and uncrowded . <p> But it wo n't be long before 80,000 people will be competing on football Saturdays for parking spaces , restaurant seats , turn lanes and , after the game , for tables or standing room at the Georgia Theatre or the 40 Watt Club . ( The first home game is Sept. 10 against the University of Tennessee . ) Students will be flooding into town soon , too - classes start Sept. 14 , and 28,000 are expected to enroll this fall . The tolerant , laid- back town accommodates all comers , from Birkenstocked waifs wearing two pounds of eyeliner to alums in red Sansabelt pants and coordinating black knit shirts . <p> Alumni who have n't been back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the familiar has sometimes succumbed to the constant reinvention characterizing college towns . Newcomers will want to check out the historic and cultural scene - including nightlife - to see what 's happening in the town that spawned the B-52 's and R.E.M . Others will learn firsthand why former students with college degrees are willing to work as waiters and bartenders : They can stay in Athens . <p> The most immediate change in Athens is apparent from miles away . The trip is no longer a two-lane torture past the pottery-filled yards and boiled peanut stands of U.S. 29 or a two-hour sentence in the white- knuckled universe of strip malls along U.S. 78 . With the completion of Ga . 316 , Athens on normal days is an unencumbered 90-minute drive from Atlanta . Of course , on football Saturdays , even a four-lane highway wo n't ensure speed . <p> If you want to see more of Athens than the 100 green yards in Sanford Stadium , it 's best to visit when the Bulldogs are n't playing , or to get an early start on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before game time , while the streets are still clear enough to allow a driving tour . Start your visit with a trip to the Athens Welcome Center on East Doughtery Street . Purchase a $ 1.50 guide and you 're ready to start . <p> The center , open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m . Tuesdays through Saturdays and 2 to 5 p.m . Sundays , is in the 174-year-old Church-Waddel-Brumby House , the oldest existing structure in town . <p> Other sites of note on the driving tour : The 1856 President 's Home on Prince Avenue , home of UGA President Chuck Knapp ( you 'll need an invitation to visit ) ; the Taylor-Grady House , a National Historic Landmark that dates from 1845 and which was , briefly , the home of Atlanta Constitution editor Henry W. Grady ; and The Tree That Owns Itself , at the corner of Dearing and Findley streets . Legend has it that W.H. Jackson , a university faculty member , " does convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself , and of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though no record of this transaction has ever been found , the white oak that Jackson had loved for most of his life was enclosed by granite posts and chains and the site is designated by a marker . <p> What you 'll be seeing is The Offspring of The Tree That Owns Itself . The original tree died after being damaged in a sleet storm at the turn of the century . In 1946 , the Junior Ladies ' Garden Club planted a replacement , reportedly a seedling of the original . <p> If you do n't take the tour , you nevertheless should make a brief detour onto Milledge Avenue and continue south past several grand houses , occupied primarily by sororities and fraternities , to Lumpkin Street and the Five Points neighborhood . <p> From Milledge , turn left onto Lumpkin and head north toward downtown . A few blocks on your right , you 'll see the modern Butts-Mehre building rising behind the UGA track . Headquarters for the Georgia Athletic Department , the building also houses a small museum devoted to university sports . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2 to 5 p.m. on weekends . Admission is free . <p> Keep going north on Lumpkin until you cross Broad Street to downtown , a pleasant place to walk and shop . Warning : Parking is at a premium ; be sure to feed the meter every day except Sunday or risk a ticket . There 's a public parking garage at College Avenue and Washington Street . <p> The heart of downtown is Clayton Street , with shops and boutiques stocked with everything from formalwear and designer jewelry to Doc Martens , clothes , books , CDs and handmade chocolates . Downtown is where you 're likely to encounter free outdoor concerts , street vendors selling jewelry and tie-dyed T-shirts and kids plunking out guitar tunes for quarters . <p> There are book stores and gift shops - Frontier , Loblolly and Dreamcatcher are worth your time - on Jackson Street , as well as two good coffee shops . College Avenue features the newsstand Barnett 's , an Athens fixture . <p> If you walk a block from Clayton to the corner of Washington and Hull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaudeville theatre on the National Register of Historic Places that was built , owned and operated by blacks for black audiences . <p> The restored 1910 building is worth a close look . For a list of performances , or to arrange for a tour of the building , call administrative secretary Rodney Thomas , 706-613-3770 . <p> Across Broad Street , at the intersection of College Avenue , is a cast iron arch , the symbol of the university and the main entrance to the historic , picturesque north campus . Legend has it that freshmen who walk under the arch risk sterility . You 'll likely find students playing hackey sack or Frisbee under the tall trees . A slim but valuable paperback by UGA historian Nash Boney , " A Walking Tour of the University of Georgia , " can be found at most bookstores in the Athens area . <p> Go first to the Georgia Museum of Art . Two exhibitions start Sept. 24 , one of American folk art and another entitled " Ann Orr : Silversmith , Goldsmith and Enamelist . " For more information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quadrangle is the imposing main library , and inside is the Hargrett Library , where you can view antique Victorian furniture and browse through the extensive and interesting collection in the Georgia Room . It features works by and about Georgians as well as works printed in Georgia . Hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m . Saturdays . <p> If you 're in a reflective mood or need a brief respite , head to the Founders ' Memorial Garden behind the School of Environmental Design . Created in the 1940s by Hubert Owens , former dean of the school , it commemorates the Ladies ' Garden Club of Athens , the first such club organized in the United States . <p> For a larger outdoor experience , head down Milledge Avenue Extension to the State Botanical Garden , which has five miles of wooded walking trails that offer nice views of the Oconee River . In September , the rose garden will be blooming . <p> And then , there 's always that drama between the hedges on certain Saturdays .
