Have you ever wished dogs could talk and you could understand them ? Well , dogs can communicate with each other and you . Most of us just do n't know how to understand them . Scientists called animal behaviorists have studied wild dogs and wolves and found that these animals live in packs with a leader who is called the dominant one . The others in the pack are submissive to him . That is , they look to him for direction , protection , and order , and they have carefully observed rules . How do they communicate with each other ? They use their voices at times , but they also use body language . This includes using their eyes , mouth , ears , tail , scent , and the way they move . Let 's look at some of the things dogs may be saying : " I am the boss " In studies of wolves and wild dogs , behaviorists have observed dominance ( bossiness ) and submissiveness ( willingness to be bossed ) . We see this in some dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning forward , and trying to look larger . He will stare the other wolf in the eyes , point his ears up and forward , pull his lips forward , hold his tail up and wag it stiffly , and the hair on the neck and shoulders stands up . He may place his front feet on the shoulders of the submissive animal . If he becomes very angry , he will wrinkle his nose and snarl . You can see this kind of behavior in some dogs . " You are the boss " A submissive wolf will pull his mouth back in a submissive smile , avoid direct eye contact , flatten his ears back , tuck his tail between his legs , and wag it in this low position . He may also lower his body close to the ground to try to look smaller and even crawl forward on his belly . Submissive dogs show much of this same behavior . " Let 's play " When a dog bounces down on his tummy with his rear end sticking up in the air and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ears will be flattened back and he may raise one paw . " Please help me " Dog problems are usually caused by the way people treat dogs . They have many different feelings just as you do . A dog can feel neglected and lonely if he is left home alone all day , every day . He can seem to feel jealous if a new baby or a new pet joins the family . He shows this by trying to get your attention and by always being underfoot . He may appear depressed and do naughty things or not eat . He is showing that he needs extra attention and love . If he develops health problems or behavioral problems , or seems very sad , he should be checked by a vet . Then you need- to try to find out what is bothering him . A dog 's mind is very sensitive . The only messages from you that he can understand are in tone of voice and body language . In training him , praise his good behavior and never be cruel or harsh with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , either . He may not understand that you are playing . He may think that you are threatening him and will try to defend himself This does not make him a bad dog . It just means that you must learn to treat him the correct way . " What was that ? " Have you ever heard a " woof " from your dog ? It is a surprised bark with the mouth closed . It is a sound he makes when he hears something , but is not sure just what it is . " Please " Whining means a dog is asking for something . You may have to guess what it is , but he will probably give you some clues if you watch carefully . " Watch it " Most everyone is familiar with the sound of a growl . A growl is a warning and you should take it seriously " I was here " Every dog has his own scent and when a dog urinates on a post , tree , fire hydrant , or the grass , he ( or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also his way of telling other dogs that he was there . This is a wolfish practice and is still continued by domestic dogs . As dogs go along sniffing posts , trees , etc. , they can tell which dogs have been there and how long ago . When they scratch up the ground with their front and hind paws after marking , it is also to show that they were there . " Who are you ? " Have you noticed that when two dogs meet , they take turns sniffing each other ? This is one of the things wolves do and dogs do , too . They also sniff people when they meet , as you have probably experienced . When you meet a strange dog , do n't look him in the eye . If he is a dominant type , he may take this as a challenge . Of course , if you are in his territory , he may challenge you . Never bend over a strange dog , try to pick him up , or reach out to pet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be true if you try to take something away from him . Jerky movements and loud noises may startle him and provoke him to attack . Keep your hands down by your sides and walk away calmly . You may be able to prevent an attack from a challenging dog by turning away and pretending that he is not there . When you move toward a strange dog , move sideways instead of head-on , and avoid direct eye contact . This is a friendly and respectful approach which dogs use and understand . " I 'm glad to see you " When you meet a dog who wags his tail in wide sweeps with it hanging down and who also puts his ears down , he is probably a friendly type . This is also the way wolves show friendliness . Tail-wagging , however , varies with the breed of dog , so you ca n't determine if a dog is friendly by tail-wagging alone . Getting to know you You can better understand your dog by spending time with him and observing his body language . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , " " Let 's take a walk , " " I 'm hungry , " " I do n't want to do that ! " " How about some attention ? " and other special messages . Is n't it amazing how much a dog can say without words ? Now you know that dogs can communicate . And you can even understand a lot of what they are " saying . " // <p>
