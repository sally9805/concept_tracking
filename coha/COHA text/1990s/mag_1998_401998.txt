// * Your man might be The One-the he that puts the they in " They lived happily ever after . " But what really happens after the two of you ride off into the perfect sunset ? Will lie still drive you crazy with passion 10 years from now ? Or will he just drive you crazy ? Unfortunately , too few brides- and grooms-to-be take time to ask themselves these kinds of questions before walking down the aisle-one reason why half of all marriages go bust . If you 're looking to make a match with more staying power than , say , M.C. Hammer , then you need to face the future head-on  --  and consider the possible trials as well as the triumphs . To find out what really goes on after the honeymoon , we got straight talk from couples at various stages in their relationships . They gave us the scoop on the issues they expect to deal with ' til death do them part : in-laws , bank accounts , dirty socks .... Here 's what marriage is really like-from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been together 10 freakin ' years ! " year one : " The wildest , sexiest time imaginable " You 're nauseatingly happy , affectionate , madly in love-you ca n't keep your hands off each other . And that 's just how you behave in public . When they were married 10 years ago , restaurateur Eric Petterson , 41 , and his actress wife Noelle Beck , 30 , christened their new house by having sex in every room " It 's the wildest , sexiest time imaginable , " Noelle remembers . It 's a scintillating combination of freshness-even if you slept together before  --  hand , you 're still relatively new to each other  --  and the newfound security of marriage . " Now that we 're married , we 're more emotionally and intimately connected than ever , " says Melissa Stolper , 27 , a public relations exec who wed 26  --  year-old investment broker , Dave , ayear ago . " Now there 's a lifetime commitment , and that changes things . " Still , while the romance is red-hot , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newlyweds bicker almost as often as they boink . " This is when real love meets real life , " says Mira Kirshenbaum , couples therapist and author of Our Love Is Too Good to Feel So Bad ( Avon Books , 1998 ) . " So there 's bound to be some tension . " You 've surrendered control-of your living space , your social life , your finances . Things can no longer be just the way you want them , and that 's scary . So major fights erupt over minor things like dirty dishes in the sink and the way the toilet paper hangs . " I never want to be a nagging housewife , " says Melissa . " But Dave is a little messy . Neatness is n't a priority for him . So that 's always going to be an issue . " Melissa and Dave have already settled into a clean-up pattern : She points it out , he picks it up . Only time will tell if she 'll give up or if he 'll get the gist . But Melissa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave fight , and lets that arguments with her husband have taken on a new weight since they 've said " I do . " " When we argue , it 's like " Oh my God , we are married adults and we 're fighting . Wedding , divorce-this is serious now . " Do n't panic . All newlyweds go through a huge adjustment phase-and it 's almost guaranteed that you wo n't always see eye to eye . " But liese petty fights early on actually may lead to a big payoff in the years to come , " says Kirshenbaum. year three : We 've learned how to clear the air . " By year three , most couples have learned the main lesson of a successful marriage : It 's about helping one another , not about proving who 's right and who 's wrong . " One of the greatest victories in marriage is when you identify the battles that you do n't need to fight , " says Kirshenbaum . But that 's easier said than done . After all , even couples who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 're getting into when they make their vows , so it takes a few years to adjust . You may not have seen his fondness for South Park imitations coming . Who knows how many times you can hear " oh my God ! They killed Kenny ! " before you want to kill him ? Murder is never the answer . Case in point : Howard Margolis , 32 , an investment banker , recalls the day , about three years into his marriage , that he finally accepted a bitter truth about his wife of five years , Donna , 31 , an attorney : She will never learn to hang on to her eyeglasses . " Every night , she puts her glasses down in a different place , and I have to go find them , " he says . " So it is one of my chores in life , finding her glasses . Who knew ? " Though this is one of the more minor issues between Howard and Donna , he says it 's indicative ol the way that married couples learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't keep harping on certain things , " he says . " Otherwise you will kill each other . " Instead , what couples do at this stage is identify the real issues  --  what the priorities of your relationship really are . Squabbling over money actually brought an even bigger issue to light for Noelle  --  what came first herself or her family ? Five years into their marriage , Noelle and Eric already had two little girls , Forrest and Spencer , to take care of . Before she was a Mrs. , Noelle was commanding a handsome paycheck as a soap-opera actress  --  and was spending it as she pleased . " I was accustomed to going out and buying Manolo Blahniks without my husband screaming , You spent $400 on shoes ? ' " she says . Now , Noelle says she is glad that her husband helped her develop the habit of saving for her family 's future . But not all the fighting collies to an end . Some couples still take to the mat-they just get better at it . " Arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " explains 28-year-old Yakenya Moise about her husband of three years . When she 'd lay into him about something trivial-like when they-were redecorating their office and she wanted the desk here while he wanted it there-he would n't fight back , which frustrated her even more . " I thought it was a waste of time to argue , " says Jimmy , 33 , who co-owns an entertainment company with his wife . After three years and too many incomplete arguments that did n't get them anywhere , they 've settled into a fighting style that gets results . Now , when there are differences between the two of them , they hash it out . " Jimmy now actually argues against me , because he knows it helps me cool off , " says Yakenya. year five : ' You 're my family . " At five years , you 're finally a real family of your own , not a haphazard blend of your world and his world . " At this point , you 've abandoned hand-me-down standards , " says Kirshenbaum . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the one you wish they 'd had . " " At the beginning of the marriage , you expect that the family you 're joining will be just like the one you came from , " explains Donna . Those expectations caused trouble , she says , because she and Howard come from very different households : Her clan is very direct and quick to express themselves , while Howard 's is more likely to tiptoe around an issue . " For example , his mother would ask us over for dinner on Friday night , and even though Howard knew we 'd be too exhausted to socialize , he 'd say , Let me check with Donna , " ' she says . " He thought he was being polite , but he was really putting me in the position of saying no , which made me look bad . " But in their fifth year , Howard and Donna now know how to work together to have a smooth relationship with the inlaws . " There 's a point where you look at your partner and realize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned not to let our in-laws worry us , " says Howard . But year five has also brought a new take on an old battle : kids . At first , their arguments were hypothetical : when and how many ? But the recent birth of their son , Adam , has created a controversial question : How will the parenting responsibilities be divided once Donna goes back to work ? Howard says they 'll be divided 50-50 , but Donna is n't so sure . " We 'll try to be equal , but I am sure I will have more of the responsibility , " she says . Photograph // Even though they had their children earlier , Noelle and Eric were far from having all the answers at the five-year mark . Although Noelle was the primary caretaker , Eric was still expected to pull hiS weight , something that came as a shock to him . As the owner of trendy New York City restaurants , lie was used to working late nights . Noelle resented the havoc that his erratic schedule had on her well-being-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some revision or his marriage would suffer . The upshot ? He cut back on the schmoozing and started getting home early in the evening , when Noelle needed him to be there . Noelle has a 9-to-5 nanny who makes it possible for her to do commercials , but for now , she has put her Hollywood aspirations on hold . She simply did n't want her children to grow up seeing anyone else as their Mom . " I really want the career , but realized that I personally ca n't have it all , " she says . " I still have n't completely come to terms with this yet . " Kirshenbaum is n't surprised . " When it comes to balancing work , kids , and marriage , you 'll be a lot happier if you give up the idea that there is one perfect solution , " she says . " There is n't one . " As long as you accept the difficulties and are equally committed to making things work , you 're definitely on the right track . year ten : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chances are your bond has been tried more times than O.J. And still , you 're together . Big problem . Because when two people get along so well that they stop surprising each other , boredom starts to set in . Noelle and Eric see this threat and use a three-prong approach to prevent togetherness from breeding contempt . First , whether they 're talking al ) out taking summer trips al ) road or remodeling their home , Eric and Noelle constantly think about what lies ahead for their family . There 's a comfort in knowing that they 're building a life together-forever . Second , they steer clear of getting in a romantic rut . Sometimes it 's a mini mushy maneuver , like Noelle leaving goofy voice-mail messages to make Eric 's day . Or it could be something outrageous , like the year that Eric shaved his head and wrote " Happy Anniversary " on his shiny pate . But Noelle and Eric 's third and most important pointer for lasting love ? They always remind themselves how lucky they are . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago has completed their family , and the peace and stability they 've found makes Noelle , a child of divorce , unspeakably happy . " I 'm so happy , sometimes I burst into tears when we sit down to dinner together , " she says . And after 10 years of hard work , they all deserve to sit back and enjoy the moment .
