<p> Rev. Sun Myung Moon , the founder of the Unification Church , has shown remarkable success at blending messianism with business . Until recently , that is . <p> Moon , who became known in the West during the 1970s for conducting mass weddings of his followers and for his church 's controversial recruiting techniques , also controls a South Korean chaebol , or conglomerate , called the Tongil group . He has used Tongil-affiliated companies and other church-related businesses around the world to subsidize his political and religious pursuits , such as the publication of conservative newspapers and the building of schools and seminaries . <p> But lately , church-related businesses around the world have been plagued by poor performance . The eight biggest members of the Tongil group , which include an auto parts maker , a beverage company and a newspaper , lost a total of nearly $ 40 million in 1990 , according to public financial documents . <p> Tongil companies apparently own more than enough real estate  --  including a valuable plot of vacant land in the heart of Seoul 's financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the troubles afflicting the group raise the question of whether Moon can continue to funnel resources into his nonbusiness activities . <p> " When do the musical chairs stop ? " said Melissa Brown , a senior analyst at the Seoul office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd . <p> Son Dae O , a Unification Church member and editor of the Moon-controlled Segye Times in Seoul , dismissed fears about Tongil 's soundness as overblown , saying Moon is in no danger of finding himself without the resources to fund treasured operations such as the church-owned Washington Times . <p> According to sources in Washington , there has been no indication of a slackening in financial support for the Washington Times , even though its new weekend editions have reportedly been a financial disappointment . <p> The PBS investigative program " Frontline " presents a report tonight on Channel 26 on Unification Church-supported political activities in the United States . Details , Page E1 . <p> " As a religious leader , he wants to save this corrupt world , " Son said . " So in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if some financial difficulties occur , he will place the press first . He is not so poor . He is rich enough to manage the Washington Times and the Segye Times . " Reports in the Korean press about the difficulties facing Moon 's businesses , Son added , are simply the work of " newspapers that want to make sensational news . " <p> The details of all the assets controlled by Moon and his organizations are known only to Moon himself and his most trusted aides , but this much seems clear : A number of Moon-controlled businesses are under strain , and their relationships with Moon 's religious and political activities are engendering less symbiosis than problems these days . <p> An example came last month , following a trip by Moon to North Korea . There , Moon met with aging communist leader Kim Il Sung and promised to make an investment in industrial and tourist facilities aimed at furthering one of his most cherished goals  --  Korean reunification . The Seoul government reacted sternly to Moon 's freelance diplomacy , accusing him of " causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement fueled a plunge in the shares of Tongil-affiliated companies , which for more than a week fell by the maximum amount permitted each day . Investors feared that the authorities would pressure banks to withdraw support from Tongil companies  --  and that fear seemed about to materialize when Korea First Bank , the group 's lead creditor , disclosed that it likely would halt further loans . Yonhap , South Korea 's semiofficial news agency , reported that Tongil " is headed for a financial crisis . " <p> But within days , the panic abated  --  and Tongil shares started to soar  --  because of an unexpected political development : North Korea and South Korea , bitter enemies since World War II , struck a nonaggression and reconciliation accord . That took Moon off the hook for any alleged splitting of national opinion , and lenders declared themselves ready to lend again . <p> The complex relationship between Moon and the Seoul government is daunting for outsiders to fathom . But taking events on their face value , the episode underscored the pressures that can be imposed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of capitalism . <p> Here , the Finance Ministry can determine which companies or industries get loans and which do n't , in part through its power to appoint the presidents of major banks . Although ministry officials deny engaging in such political machinations , many here say it is commonplace . " The government is in a position to bankrupt a whole business group in short order , " said one foreign banker who has lived in Seoul for years . <p> The tale of what happened to Tongil " is very Korean , " said analyst Brown . " First and foremost , these kinds of financial crises are just as much political as they are financial . It 's always been important to make a credit judgment in Korea on the basis of whether a company or business group enjoys government support . " <p> For Moon 's business outlook , she added , what is worrisome is that " there are lots of political reasons for the government not to be in love with the Tongil group right now . " <p> Throughout much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmoniously with his spiritual and political pursuits . <p> During the mid-1980s , Tongil was one of the fastest-growing of the chaebol , rising from 48th in 1985 to 33rd in 1988 . <p> The tens of millions of dollars required for expansion were widely believed to be coming from operations in Japan , where some church members allegedly established businesses selling religious articles made by one of the Tongil companies , using high-pressure sales tactics and extracting enormously high prices , according to a report by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations . Unification Church officials , stating that the church does not control its members ' occupations , have accused the bar group of persecuting religions and harboring " satans . " <p> Whatever the source of the money , Moon seemed to have little trouble getting enough of it to fund things he wanted to do . He started the Segye Times in 1989 , and the paper quickly developed a reputation for aggressive , independent reporting . Earlier this year , it irritated plenty of highly placed Koreans by breaking the story of a major housing scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business executive to good effect in former communist-bloc countries , where he clearly envisions a wealth of potential converts to the Unification Church . In April 1990 , for example , he traveled to Moscow , where he met with then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev . His overtures to Gorbachev , who was very interested in receiving South Korean aid , were credited widely with helping Moscow and Seoul normalize diplomatic relations . <p> But even before last month 's financial blowup , the Moon brew of business , religion and politics seemed to be turning sour in spots : <p> Sae Il Heavy Industries Co. , a maker of auto parts and machine tools that has $ 368 million in annual sales and is the Tongil group 's flagship firm , is still reeling from the effects of a lengthy 1989 strike that resulted in part from workers ' complaints that the company treated Unification Church members preferentially . <p> Sae Il steadily has been losing customers for its transmissions and axles among Korean automakers , who are concerned that Sae Il will suffer further labor unrest , according to analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous $ 33 million loss in 1989 , profit in 1990 was a meager $ 2.5 million and is n't expected to improve much this year . <p> The Segye Times also has lost immense sums  --  roughly $ 50 million in 1990 , according to Korea Investors Service . <p> Such losses are hardly surprising for a newspaper in its early years . But the paper suffered a blow to its reputation for hard-hitting journalism late last year when 150 editors and reporters resigned to protest the transfer of 20 staff members from a church-owned religious weekly . A little over half of the strikers have returned to their jobs , according to Son , the editor . <p> Another major Tongil affiliate , Ilhwa Co. , suffered a $ 38 million loss last year . Demand for the company 's main product , a barley-flavored soft drink designed to appeal to traditional Korean tastes , has " declined sharply " since 1989 , according to Korea Investors Service , which noted in a report that new competing products such as milk-based drinks and " sports " drinks are stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to stop the drain of cash , and according to the Segye Times ' Son , Moon 's aides have broached the idea of unloading some Tongil assets . But Moon " got angry " with such defeatist talk and decreed , " no sales , " Son said . <p> A highly touted joint car-making venture between the Moon-affiliated Panda Motor Co. and the government of China has been put on hold after a reported investment of $ 200 million , news accounts in the United States have said . <p> According to reports in the Korean media , the flow of funds to Moon 's operations from Japan is shrinking  --  and there is evidence to support the thesis , although it is impossible to confirm . <p> Japanese church members have been hit with a barrage of lawsuits to stop their alleged high-pressure tactics in selling religious articles . A lawyer involved in representing the plaintiffs against church members said the once-lucrative business has been drastically curtailed . <p> Whatever all this really means for Moon 's financial position is unknown , but he has shown scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent Robin Bulman contributed to this report .
