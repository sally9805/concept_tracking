There 's something about ticks that drives even the most well-balanced among us a bit nutty . They 're too small to feel when they 're crawling on your skin . They pack their own anesthetic , so you do n't realize they 're burying their heads in your body . And they suck your blood for hours at a stretch . Besides grossing you out , ticks may carry certain bacteria that can make you very , very sick , as thousands of folks in the Northeast and Midwest who have developed Lyme disease can tell you . <P> But Lyme disease is n't the only or even the deadliest tick-borne infection . Ever since 1986 , when the first cases cropped up in the U.S. , researchers have been keeping a watchful eye on a debilitating and sometimes fatal flu-like ailment called Ehrlichiosis . The infection is transmitted by the Lone Star tick in the southern half of the U.S. and the ever present deer tick in the north . It was once thought to afflict only dogs and horses , but four strains of bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last week came word that a fifth strain , called Ehrlichia ewingii , which is particularly common among dogs in Missouri , can cause illness in their masters as well . <P> The new bacterium was identified in four patients as well as two of their dogs by researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , Mo. , in a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine . " We do n't think the dogs gave the infection to the people directly through licks or bites , " says Dr. Gregory Storch , an infectious-disease specialist who led the study . " We think both pets and patients were innocent victims . " <P> What 's particularly worrisome about Ehrlichiosis is that it 's not easy to spot . There 's no telltale rash , as occurs in Lyme disease . Nor is there an easy test for it . Doctors must rely on such circumstantial evidence as a low level of white blood cells and abnormal spots on those cells . And an antibiotic commonly prescribed for Lyme disease  --  amoxicillin  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug , doxycycline , that does the trick . Left untreated , however , severe cases of the infection can kill in a few days . <P> Does this mean you should never walk in the woods again ? Absolutely not . But a few precautions are in order . Tuck your pants into your socks , spray DEET on your clothes and stay away from the grassy , overgrown areas favored by ticks . Also , be sure to check your body and your kids ' bodies at least once a day . <P> Since it takes as long as 24 hours for bacteria to get from the tick into your bloodstream , it pays to remove ticks as soon as you can . Do n't try holding a burnt match to the tick to make it back out . Apart from scorching yourself , you 'll just provoke it into regurgitating its potentially toxic baggage into your body . Instead , take a pair of tweezers , line them up alongside the tick 's body and as close to your skin as you can and gently pull out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tick , as that can force its insides into your body as well . After the tick is out , wash the area of the bite with antiseptic , and place the tick in a plastic container marked with the date in case your doctor needs to test it later to confirm a diagnosis . Most important , do n't delay getting medical help if you develop a fever or rash . Both Ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease are easily cured if caught right away .
