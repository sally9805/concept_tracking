<p> WASHINGTON  --  Every class and company has one : a brilliant , focused standout who never breaks the rules or strays from convention . For years Al Gore occupied that position in the political firmament . His descent into the fund-raising quagmire that now threatens his presidential ambitions could hardly be more ironic . <p> Gore rose through the House and Senate to the vice presidency on his reputation as Mr. Clean . For five years he has been moral ballast in an administration awash in ethics investigations . Yet each day brings more questions , and harsh editorials , about his role in last year 's fevered race for campaign cash . <p> " What people wanted from Gore , and the thing he appeared to give them , was a sense of probity and staying within the boundaries and really being dependable , " says psychoanalyst Stanley Renshon , head of the political psychology program at City University of New York Graduate Center . " Now his dependability has been called into question . He has to figure out how to resurrect his image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gore could face the ultimate challenge . Attorney General Janet Reno is due to decide by year 's end whether to request an independent counsel to examine , among other things , whether Gore violated the law with his phone solicitations from his White House office and his appearance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple . <p> " It 's Al Gore 's worst nightmare . It takes control of his own destiny out of his own hands , " former Republican Party chairman Rich Bond says of the prospect of a special counsel dogging Gore 's 2000 presidential bid . <p> Bond should know . He was chairman in 1992 , when a special counsel got an Iran-contra indictment of Caspar Weinberger , then Defense secretary , two days before the election . Bond and other Republicans contend it halted a late surge by then-president Bush and may have cost him the race . <p> If there 's one thing politicians hate to lose , besides elections , it 's control . " The president of the United States has to give the impression that he 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is he the custodian of his own career ? What are his resources for flexibility and putting the best light on himself ? That will be the test of his campaign for the nomination , " says Erwin Hargrove , a presidential scholar at Vanderbilt University . <p> Not used to attacks on his ethics <p> Like Presidents Clinton and Bush before him , Gore is sticking to his routine and trying to stay far above the unfolding mess . " You can only take the attitude that I 'll keep doing my job , let the lawyers deal with whatever has to be dealt with , and move forward , " says Lynn Cutler , director of intergovernmental affairs at the White House and a Gore friend . " He 's working hard . He 's got a variety of things that were already on his plate and he 's doing them . " <p> Focusing on the people 's business has been a successful coping mechanism for Clinton . But Gore is also using some of the White House 's less effective techniques , tightly controlling who talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ releasing information late , sparsely and only when pressed . <p> The one time he did try to address questions about his phone solicitations , at a March 4 press conference , he contended over and over that there was " no controlling legal authority " against making the calls . The phrase became an instant political classic . " What this administration could use is some controlling ethical authority , " the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette editorialized this month . <p> Other papers have been even more direct . " It was a temple , you idiot , " declared the headline over an editorial in The ( Cleveland ) Plain Dealer , quoting a note from one Democratic operative to another . " ' I Did n't Know '  --  Is Al Gore Too Stupid To Be President ? " the conservative Manchester , N.H. , Union-Leader wondered this month on a day Gore visited the state . <p> Gore has done well before in high-pressure situations , among them two vice presidential debates and his slam-dunk trade debate with Ross Perot on CNN 's Larry King Live . But those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope with any kind of ethics issues . This is a first for him , which is maybe the reason he does n't handle it as well as he might , " says M. Lee Smith , publisher of Tennessee Journal , a political newsletter . <p> Gore 's reserved public persona is rooted in a highly public , disciplined childhood . His father , Albert Gore Sr. , was a senator from Tennessee . His family 's home in Washington was a hotel . Aware that what he said and did reflected on his father , Gore was well-behaved and circumspect . <p> " I learned at an early age to be very sensitive  --  too sensitive , perhaps  --  to what others were thinking , " Gore wrote in the preface to his 1992 book , Earth in the Balance . <p> Gore was eager to please , but he was no milquetoast . Aggressively competitive , first at school and later in politics , he has always been determined to exceed expectations . He was dutiful but not selfless . " People are dutiful in part because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychoanalyst . " There 's an element of ambition in being dutiful . " <p> Gore 's interest in the presidency dates at least to his senior year in college , when he wrote a thesis about the role of TV in presidential politics . His decision to enlist in the Army in 1969 conflicted with his negative feelings about the war but was of a piece with other elements of his personality : not to rebel ; to help his father , who was getting skewered over his opposition to the war ; to avert the same sort of struggle if he himself ran for office ; and to spare whoever might have been sent in his place from tiny Carthage , Tenn. , where he spent his summers and reported to his draft board . <p> A stint in Vietnam as a military journalist was followed by several years as a newspaper reporter . That career ended when the congressman from Gore 's home district announced he was retiring . " Gore was in the race literally the next day , " Smith recalls . <p> Restraint is core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politician was caution . <p> Gore himself said in the preface to Earth in the Balance that he had become " very impatient with my own tendency to put a finger to the political winds and proceed cautiously . " The book , an environmental call-to-arms , was an attempt to break that habit . <p> But restraint prevails when it comes to baring his personality . Twenty years after winning that first congressional race , Gore is still trying to figure out how to reveal the playful , caring , cuttingly funny man who is said to lurk behind that plodding persona . <p> He has honed one-liners poking fun at his woodenness ( " The last time I was here it was so cold , people thought I was frozen stiff " ) and he does an amusing riff about his presidential record to date  --  the five minutes between when Clinton 's first term ended and he was sworn in for his second term ( 3.2 new jobs created , two new community cops on the beat and the nation at peace ) . <p> He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks movingly of his sister 's death from lung cancer and his son 's near-death in a car accident . But those moments are calculated and isolated . After the jokes or the orchestrated event , he 's back to his bland public self . <p> " There is a basic shyness to Gore that makes it very difficult for him to open himself up to strangers , " says his longtime media strategist , Bob Squier . " I do n't think he 'll ever get less shy , but he 'll get more comfortable making himself available to the public . " <p> Has more at risk <p> The controversy is starting to take a political toll . A new Time/CNN Poll shows Gore 's approval rating at 51% , vs. 58% in April . And the poll shows Gore basically tied with Texas Gov . George W. Bush , a relative unknown nationally , when voters are asked which man they would vote for in the 2000 presidential election . Gore gets 43% , Bush 44% . Finally , only 49% of people in a new ABC News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , down 10 points from March . <p> Some analysts say he must connect better with voters . People " forgive the scoundrel part " of Clinton 's nature because they believe he is warm-hearted and sincere about wanting to help them , Hargrove says . <p> " Gore does not come through in quite that way . He 's more cerebral , " Hargrove says . <p> That 's one of the many reasons Gore is likely to suffer more than Clinton for the pair 's fund-raising excesses last year . He 's the one with the live political career at a time when the public may be succumbing to what Renshon calls " scoundrel fatigue . " And having been on a pedestal , he has farther to fall . <p> " If you 've made a career out of your uprightness , then the smallest movement away from uprightness will seem larger than if you 're coming to town as a charming rogue , " says Tony Blankley , a damage control expert in his days as press secretary to House Speaker Newt Gingrich . <p> Gore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The special-counsel announcement and the Buddhist nuns ' testimony came as the nation was fixated on the death of Princess Diana . And if his poll numbers should drop farther , he has time to recoup . Even assuming House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt pursues a campaign , pundits see no serious primary challengers in the offing . <p> Still , it 's easy to picture the inevitable , and eye-catching , attack ads showing Gore surrounded by robed Buddhist nuns . Already he has had to defend himself in New Hampshire , site of the pivotal first presidential primary . " When the reviews are complete , it will be fully shown that what I did was legal and appropriate , " he told WMUR-TV . <p> Shades of Clinton , whose 1992 campaign nearly died in New Hampshire in an avalanche of womanizing and draft-dodging allegations .
