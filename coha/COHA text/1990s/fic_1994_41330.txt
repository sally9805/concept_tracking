Quilting : The Piecing of Past and Present in Women 's Lives . <p> " There 's one you 've got to see , " my colleague Zo said and pointed me in the direction of Paducah , Kentucky , an hour 's drive from Martin where I was teaching poetry writing at the University of Tennessee . " It 's part of the Baltimore Album Revival in the east gallery and it 's only there through Saturday , so you 'd better go today ! Oh , and by the way , it 's based on a New England poet 's work - Celia Thaxter . Have you read her ? " No I had n't . It was Friday afternoon and if I broke the speed limit , I would have half an hour before the three-dimensional quilt of flowers I was about to see for myself , flowers rising up right out of the stitches and seams as though they were real and stretching toward light , snapdragons , poppies , marigolds , black-eyed Susans , all so delicately sculpted you might think you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my students ' notions of " text , " this would be my own opportunity to " read poetry " from a different kind of text - the quilt - a medium about which , with the exception of a faint memory of a large quilt frame that dwarfed the pump organ in my great-grandmother 's parlor , I was all but illiterate . <p> I stood at the opening of the main gallery where quilts from the permanent collection were displayed , entranced by Caryl Bryer Fallert 's fiery quilt , Corona II : Solar Eclipse , which hung at the center . This had been the piece , with its brilliant swirls of primary colors , each cloth prism meticulously hand-dyed for its stunning effect , to which I had surrendered two years earlier on my first visit to the Museum of the American Quilter 's Society . Until then , I had thought of quilting as " only a craft . " But this , I knew , was art . <p> Once inside the archway to the Baltimore Album Revival , mounted in one of two side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , its emptiness made leviathan by the contrast of richly colored blocks of fabric on every side , and my heart sank as I read the plate marking the space of the quilt so obviously missing : A tribute to Celia Thaxter ( 1835-1894 ) by Faye Labanaris . No tangled blooms left there . Only my disappointment to swell the space . <p> I had missed it by thirty minutes . At the very moment I inquired of the quilt 's whereabouts , Labanaris ' recreation of Celia Thaxter 's garden was being boxed for early shipment to a Vermont show of New England quilters . It may have been that small fact that engaged me - how would you ship any one of those exquisitely conceived cloth dramas ? - or perhaps it was , more simply , the desire to salvage the trip I 'd made . In any case , the museum was closing and I left , not minding the blast of sultry afternoon heat , my thoughts quite preoccupied by the intricacies of what I imagined entailed the collecting , preserving and showing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Martin , my dashboard notepad held a long list of questions . <p> As I pursued various tasks that weekend , my mind wandered intermittently back to the museum , recollecting my first experience there . Images of quilted cloth peppered my thoughts and with them came those same imperceptible shudders traveling up my spine and then spreading through up my spine and then spreading through my shoulders ; it felt as though hands rested there - a laying on of those many hands which had crafted the quilts filling every sight line from where I had first stood two years ago - hands suffused with warmth , once again , touching me . And seeming to speak - of women gathered in circles , scrapbags of cloth left over from a homemade dress , kitchen curtains , and flannel workshirts , the clink of ice in tea laced with wild mint , the hum of stories , strings knotted and left to dangle like punctuation to everything said . I wanted to know more about those women and the quilts which they had so carefully pieced together . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Paducah . When I did , Victoria Faoro , the museum Curator and Director , graciously took time out from her intense schedule to meet with me . Holding a list of my questions in one of her hands and , in the other , a pen which darted up and down in the space between us , like a needle pulling together threads of thought , she drew me into the circle where I could begin to hear , through her , some of the voices that echoed in quilts made of patterns called " Double Wedding Ring " and " Log Cabin , " and carried names like Hidden Passion , In My Father 's House , and Incantation . <p> One of the most exciting things about being involved with both the American Quilter 's Society ( AQS ) and the Museum of the American Quailter 's Society ( MASQ ) has been understanding the importance of quilting in women 's lives . There are men who are quilters , but it has been traditionally , and is today , something participated in much more extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , women have been able to gain self-confidence , a feeling of accomplishing something important . <p> That 's not new either . We just published a collection of fiction involving quilts and we saw that pattern in the fiction : for example , the maiden aunt who had always been in the corner with nobody paying any attention to her , and then she made a beautiful quilt and everybody realized that she did have something important to contribute , that she was someone able to do important things . <p> Being quilter seems to be a very important part of many women 's identity . Some women involved have had public identities connected only with their families , such as being mothers or wives . In many cases , quilting has played a very important role in their gaining visibility . They make a point of wearing quilted vests and jackets when traveling to quilt conferences , and they often quilt in public places such as waiting for an airplane . They are proud to say they are quilters . One reason for this display is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are doing and their desire to have others recognize them is also part of it . <p> Often that recognition has played a very important role in quilters ' growth as people . I can remember , in teaching some basic classes , I would invariably find at least one woman taking the class who had her life totally wrapped up in her family , and she just blossomed , having this thing that she was interested in and spent money for . There is a whole group of people for whom quilting is the first thing they 've been involved in to the extent that they felt comfortable spending time and money on themselves . A lot of people who come to our annual show do n't necessarily travel many other places without their husbands or families , but they treat themselves to a trip here - their one splurge for the year . There 's always that comment , " I never spend anything on myself , so I can do this . " They 're also the kind of people who if they have a quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think it would occur of most meetings . Many groups talk with great pride about the wonderful food their members prepare . <p> When I talk with quilters about how they began quilting , many say they began by completing a top left unfinished by an aunt , grandmother , or mother . They often speak of a sense of carrying on for that person and bringing completion to the person 's life . They also often speak of the feeling of being connected with both the person and the age-old tradition , which seems to be a key part of the experience . Quilters talk again and again of carrying on a tradition , even when they are creating innovative work that might be questioned by practirioners of the past . <p> The connection extends to the fabrics themselves . I have a box of fabric scraps and homemade paper templates belonging to my great grandmother that I 've never used , but I would not consider parting with them except to pass them on to a family member . There is something so personal about fabric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . When you have someone 's box of fabrics , you really feel as though you have bits and pieces of that person 's life . Each piece often represents the left-partially worn garment or household furnishing , or the plans for an important project for which new fabric has been purchased . There is something sacred about these materials , selected or salvaged and handled again and again by a woman as she dealt with her everyday life . One experiences both the sense of plans not completed by the person , and the potential that remains behind . Perhaps one of the things that makes fabrics so connected with their past owners is that they are not finished products in themselves but rather the " stuff of dreams , " the inspiration and means for doing special things . On a certain level , I think I feel even more connected with a person when given scraps , patterns , and partially completed tops than when I have before me a completed quilt . The evidence of another 's mind and hand are often so clear in unfinished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a way to get together and to be productive at the same time . There are a lot of church groups who 've quilted for years , nonstop . The members may have changed but the group has kept on . There are many guilds , too ; a guild meeting is as much a social event as a quilting event , and a lot of the guilds have smaller offshoot guilds that meet weekly in someone 's home where people quilt together the blocks they 've made , so that each person eventually has her own quilt . <p> A lot of quilters seem to have a sense of community , and of contributing to that community . Often it seems that quilting guilds become support groups as well as information networks . I recently spoke to a very active guild in rural Cadiz , Kentucky , and was reminded of the strength and importance of these groups . Part of almost any guild meeting is " Show and Tell . " Sometimes help is sought , but more often than not , it is a matter of showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of time , it is a place where their audience will be aware of their growth and comment on it . The response is always positive and supportive ( so much so that there has been some criticism from those who would like to see real critiques ) . At the meeting I attended a woman with dark glasses stood up and showed a quilt she had completed . It was not particularly distinctive , but received much positive response from the viewers . The woman sitting next to me explained that the maker was virtually blind from diabetes . She had been an avid quilter , had lost her sight and was very depressed and unable to quilt for some time . At some point , she decided that she would quilt again . Her husband and son now arrange the cut pieces for her in stacks so she can put them together . This quilt group has been an important part of her recovery , in the same way that quilting has been integral to many women 's recovery from traumas , emotional and physical . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own mortality ; it is tied with that need to leave something of yourself or to give something of yourself . In antique quilts , you see large initials or full names worked into the design , leaving a sign of someone 's existence for future generations to see . Many times people begin quilting to commemorate weddings , babies , and other significant events in people 's lives , creating a legacy for their family . <p> The Baltimore Album quilt particularly lends itself to people putting their personal lives in a quilt . As we were planning the Revival show featuring that style , I noticed how many stories were being told . One was made by a woman whose young son died very unexpectedly and she preserved parts of his life in the blocks of her quilt . Another one was made by a woman of Japanese heritage and she captured that in her quilt . Their quilts really are " albums " - they present parts of their lives through their quilts . <p> One woman from California , whose quilt is in the permanent collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining there . She has a photograph of him with some of the other miners that she used as a basis for the quilt . She modified it , of course , but in the process of making it she studied mining . So you have those kinds of situations where somebody learns more about their own past and forms a bond with past generations . There 's actually a tradition of attaching things to quilts . She said that she included a couple of flecks of gold in it , and it 's her little secret - that he always wanted to find his gold and could n't and now he 's got it - in this quilt . <p> There 's a fascinating Kentucky quilt called the Graveyard Quilt . Supposedly a very young son of the woman who made it died - a very young son of the woman who made it died - a very tragic story . The quilt depicts a graveyard with caskets in the center of it for the people who have already died and , around the outer edges , caskets with names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eventually being moved into the center . This is an example of a mouring quilt , one which perhaps served both to work through a painful loss and to memorialize it . <p> Sometimes people will use the clothing of the deceased in a quilt , either cut into pieces or sewn in whole . The movie " Quilts in Women 's Lives " features a woman who was commissioned to make a quilt from the clothes of a daughter who had died . A contemporary quilter I interviewed a few years ago spoke of making what she hoped would be a wedding quilt for her daughter . Her daughter died , and the quilt was buried with her . <p> Women 's tendency to have to fit personal pursuits into busy , often-interrupted lives is , I think , very related to the current use of the block pattern . It 's something you can fit in between crying children . Many women with children talk about finding an hour to quilt each might after the children are asleep or while they 're napping . Physical space may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women have traditionally had to work in limited spaces - on a kitchen table or in the corner of a bedroom . Paula Nadelstern , who lives in New York City , commented that she feels one of the reasons she may have evolved her way of making Kaleidoscope quilts is the very small space within which she must work . To design her complex quilts she works only with a small segment , a unit that is then repeated to make the quilt . She never lays out the whole quilt . The block also lends itself the same size block , brings some regularity and cohesiveness to a quilt made by many people . <p> I also think the block unit is perhaps less intimidating for a person who has not been trained in design because it is a manageable project . Blocks give a natural organization to a quilt - they simplify the mathematics , make symmetry simple . Quilting is rather different from other art forms : people find it less intimidating than other visual art forms like painting . I think the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are materials that many women have worked with also makes quilting accessible . Unlike working with paint , clay or weaving , quilting does n't require special equipment , so it is something many people have experienced . <p> There are huge numbers of very diverse people involved not only in quilt construction but also in historical preservation work . This is reflected in the state quilt documentation projects , a fascinating movement that started in Kentucky and has been going on since the early 80s . A dealer realized that a tremendous part of Kentucky 's heritage was leaving the state because dealers were buying such a large because dealers were buying such a large number of antique quilts . He saw a need to document the quilts so that even if a quilt left , there would be a record that it had existed and , he hoped , a record of where it went . <p> Four months after the museum opened , we put together an exhibit , along with a book and a videotape , that would celebrate the enormity of the documentation projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilters to a larger audience . We started a project called Gatherings to celebrate both the volunteer efforts of the documentation projects and the valuable quilts they had discovered . Each state or regional documentation project has nominated two quilts for the exhibit , which will be opening here in the spring of ' 95 . <p> The Gathering project has brought us wonderful stories of people going to great lengths to bring a quilt in to be considered . A quilt by Irene Bettit , which was selected for the Vermont exhibit of the Gatherings project , resulted in her receiving great recognition for its quality . She was extremely proud of this distinction , as was her family . She passed away during that period of time and , at her funeral , her family displayed the quilt over the casket because it had been so important for her . <p> Putting together a quilt is fascinating , in part because textile arts have tended to be viewed as second class , perhaps because of the commonality of the materials used as well as the fact that most textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , such as the American Quilters Society and the Studio Art Quilt Associates , who are trying to change this perception , and that is one of the challenges of installing an exhibit which , to my mind , is a whole art in itself . I want to present the pieces in such a way that each one looks as good as it can while also arranging the quilts in combinations to make each one more than the individual quilt would be . In a sense , when I install an exhibition , I change the pieces . My goal , when I 'm working with an exhibition , is to make very apparent to the viewer all of the wonderful things in each quilt . I try to give each quilt its own space because they 're very powerful statements , and they need that space . An exhibit needs to hold together as a whole and have some impact as an entity , but it 's very important that each piece also be strong enough to hold its own within the general context of the exhibit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved with since working with the MAQS has been Penny Sisto from Floyd 's Nob , Indiana . She is one of the most prolific quiltmakers I 've ever met , a person who makes a quilt about anything that matters to her that 's happened in the world within days of the event . She 's done one connected with Agent Orange , she was quite involved with the Viet Nam veterans , and she 's very involved in things happening in South Africa , as well as with the role of women . She 's so free in the way she communicates the thoughts and feelings that she has . Sometimes she adds extraordinary details . For example , she will make a skirt on somebody and underneath it will be all of the body that 's covered up ; her idea is that over time , as the fabrics wear , these parts will become exposed . I think that 's wonderful . <p> Quilters have supported causes through quilting in a number of ways : quilts for AIDS babies , for Ronald McDonald Houses , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quilt historian Virginia Gunn estimates that in the course of the Civil War , women in soldiers ' aid societies donated as many as 150,000 quilts and comforters . Quilts were made to support the temperance movement and abolition . Many patterns have names connected with politics , and often blocks were renamed during specific periods to express political views . Some other examples of issues-related quilting are the 1984-85 Peace Ribbon , made of sections created by hundreds of women , wrapped around the Pentagon as a protest against nuclear war ; the ongoing Boise Peace Project , begun in the 80s by a group of quilters of all ages , men and women , experienced and inexperienced , who asked each U.S. Senator to sleep under it for one night ; and the 1987 NAMES Project , commemorating individuals who have died of AIDS . <p> Caryl Bryer Fallert has been another extraordinary quilter to work with , someone very interested in color . Caryl dyed her own fabric for Corona II : Solar Eclipse . She 's a fine example of someone who 's very professional about approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is taking a year off this next year from her job as a flight attendant to quilt full-time . She has almost led the way with innovation . She started out doing very traditional things , but very early on she started to explore new territory such as machine quilting , which at one time was very controversial . In fact , the American Quilter 's Society received letters about her Corona II ; Solar Eclipse from people who thought it was disgraceful that someone who had quilted with a machine had won the Best of Show Award . The first time that a totally machine-made quilt had won a major national award like that was in 1989 , yet people do n't even comment on that now . Numerous people are doing very elaborate quilts by machine . You know , we think speed means that the quilts will be simple and not very interesting , but actually machine quilting can be truly innovative . <p> But the reality remains that it 's possible to make a very wonderful quilt with basically a needle and thread and maybe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the beauties of quilting , that it really does n't require a lot of equipment that not everyone can afford . Quilting is in a sense a very democratic art - few house-holds are missing the very basic items needed , and those who quilt really do span many otherwise separate groups in our country . It seems to me this is more so in America than in many other countries where the fabric for quilting can be very dear . Popular patterns like the Double Wedding Ring and Log Cabin are used again and again , and yet every quilt is its own ; the touch of its maker is always visible . <p> Article copyright Iris . <p> Article copyright Iris : A Journal About Women . <p> Photo ( A Tribute to Celia Thaxter ) <p>
