Sometimes the best technology is hardly any technology at all . At least that 's what I thought last week as I whizzed through Central Park for the 10th time in half as many days on a spiffy new pair of in-line skates . With surprisingly little sweet talking , I had convinced my editor that the latest models deserved a critical , hands-on  --  or rather , feet-on  --  look . <P> In-line skating is one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S. , with some 32 million devotees . And along with its growing popularity has come an array of new designs and high-tech materials , from carbon-injected plastic to glass-reinforced nylon . But I did n't really care about all that techie mumbo-jumbo . I just wanted a skate that felt fast , light and , above all , comfortable . <P> After a few trial runs through the halls of the Time &; Life Building ( and a few raised eyebrows ) , I rolled out onto the street with my friend Maryanne and a pair of Rollerblade 's new Nature skates . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , the $190 Natures are in fact hiking boots that clip onto a plastic frame with wheels . The great thing about these skates is that when we came to a slope that seemed too steep , we just popped off the frame and walked down , dignity intact . The two-piece construction felt surprisingly stable ; the boots , however , just did n't fit right . They were available only in whole sizes meant for men and women alike ( always a big mistake ) , and were too wide and tall . They felt to me like space boots . Maryanne pronounced them ugly . <P> Next up were the Outback Xs . These $250 skates were n't much of a fashion statement either , but we were fearless on them . Made with built-in shock absorbers and extra-large tires filled with air bubbles , they cruised over potholes , manholes , dips and bumps . But they felt stiff and clunky , especially going uphill . And although they were the right size , my feet ached no matter how much I fiddled with the buckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising . A flexible hinge on the bottom was supposed to let me fully extend my leg for a fast , natural stride . But the skates were downright painful . There was too much padding around the lower leg , and part of the skate dug into my inner ankle . I had another pal , Jillian , test them in her size , and her foot got so badly chafed that she had to wear Band-Aids the next day . " You could n't give these to me for free , " Jillian said , somewhat redundantly . <P> Finally I slipped into Salomon 's TR8s ( $330 ) . They were so soft and comfortable I feared I would lose all sense of reason . So I had my co-worker Mac , a serious skater and tough critic , test them out too . " It feels like your foot is wrapped in a pillow , " he said . After a couple of loops around the park , Mac decided that they felt a little " loosey-goosey " on the top of his foot . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Village hipster reputation . But my goose was n't loose , and I like attention . More important , I was skating faster than ever . Sure , the Outback Xs were smoother on bumps , and the Natures handier for running errands , but for pure skating joy , the TR8s win my vote . <P> For more on skates , visit
