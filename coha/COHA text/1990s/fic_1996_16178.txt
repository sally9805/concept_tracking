EXT . DESERT , NIGHT The view through a night scope . Green sand , dark green sky and , in the distance  --  green tanks . Ominous , forbidding . Then red light , a flashlight aimed at a map . The map is put away and the light splashes the faces of a half-dozen men . A couple of them nervous . MAJOR NATHANIEL " NAT " SERLING wields the flashlight . He has passed the night scope to his men , who gaze out into the night . They are crouched next to a tank . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThose are n't just grease pencil marks on a map anymore , that 's the enemy . Saddam 's best  --  but you 're better . Do n't underestimate the bastards , but remember this . . . you 're better . Hell , we 're just plain faster and smarter . Keep your intervals , stay on the horn and roll . Move out . LT .

We 've been through a lot together . Training , exercises , a few too many parties and maybe one too many of Top 's barbecues . You 'll do fine . We 're ready . Now let 's show the world . They shake . Boylar goes to his big Bradley tank . Serling climbs aboard his Abrams . Serling looks down inside where two men wait , the glow of the equipment dials bouncing off their faces . PATELLA , a fresh-faced kid with the beginnings of a sorry mustache , and the loader MARTINEZ . Serling gets into his seat , half-in , half-out of the turret . ROBINS , the driver , looks at him , waiting . Serling plugs his helmet into communications .  --  3  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGEverybody set ? &nbsp; PATELLAYes , sir ! Set to give ol ' Saddam Insane a whole new way to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARTINEZA virtual motherlode of pain . Serling laughs , he likes these men . He looks to the sky . And a flare arcs across it . Robins pops inside , taking the hatch closed with him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGRoll out ! And they do . Under the light of the flare Serling 's tank becomes one of hundreds on line . The Abrams move out first , leaving the Bradleys on line . After the Abrams have traveled fifty meters the Bradleys move out . Smaller cannons , ungainly beasts . The dark desert ahead of them erupts with a line of explosions . Enemy tanks firing . The rounds fall short of the Abrams , kicking up sand and fire in the desert between the Americans and their enemy . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHold your fire , hold your fire , gentlemen . Wait for your range . The Abrams move on , rolling fast , the terrain bouncing Patella and Martinez around . Another round from the enemy tanks . Short again  --  but closer . Dangerously close .

Serling 's tank rolls past this new victim . It burns , a dead man sprawled across the track . The sand next to the burning tank stirs , shifts . And then , from the sand like giant beasts rising from the bowels of the earth , four tanks emerge . T-55 's , Russian made . Big , ugly , mean looking chunks of steel . The one Serling passed swivels its turret until its big gun is aimed at the backs of the Abrams . They fire ! The huge guns belch a column of flame at the Abrams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company in line when . . . The Abrams to his left blows up ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHoly shit !

Past burning enemy tanks . He passes the pit where the enemy had hidden earlier . Serling eyes it , a thousand thoughts in his head . He stops the tank . Climbs down  --  and walks . Toward the Bradley . Burning , black smoke still tumbling out of it . An arm hangs out of the hatch . Medical personnel treat wounded on the site . Serling walks to the Bradley . And focuses on the blackened arm . On the hand  --  a ring . Boylar . And Serling 's expression is peeled away . The officer , the gentlemen , the professional  --  gone , down to naked emotion . Grief  --  guilt . He tears his eyes away from the Bradley . And looks into the red dawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DAY The red dawn becomes amber fluid in a glass .

The uniforms flow around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services . Then he turns and , with renewed vigor , heads against the tide . INT .

Later in the week , say . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNow , ASAP . Banacek frowns at Serling , hands him a pack of Tictacs from his desk . Serling takes a few . &nbsp; BANACEKI do n't think so , Nat . We 're up to our ass in legislative alligators right now and the Chief just dropped a ticking bomb in our lap . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI need to see him , Ban . &nbsp; BANACEKHow about tomorrow ?

HERSHBERGThis might be perfect . Come with me , Nat . The General leads Serling and Banacek down the corridor at full pace . Serling smiles triumphantly at Banacek  --  who does n't smile back . &nbsp; BANACEKHe 's right . You 're not going to like this . They enter a new corridor and stop outside an office . " Awards and Decorations - U.S. Army " . General Hershberg enters . INT .

Gartner salutes and leaves , a man who follows orders . &nbsp; GEN . HERSHBERGThanks , Alex . The General picks up a file from Levine 's desk . Levine flinches . And when the General slides the neatly laid out files aside and plants a haunch on the desk top Levine almost craps a pineapple . General Hershberg purposely turns his back on Bruno , who knows it , lets it slide . He 'll wait for payback.  --  14  --  Hershberg tosses the file to Serling . Levine is about to protest , but a look from the General cuts it off at the knees . &nbsp; GEN .

Captain Karen Emma Walden , first woman to be eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEN . HERSHBERGIn combat . First we got all the stink about women in combat .

Hershberg turns and looks at Bruno like he was a cockroach on a cake . &nbsp; GEN . HERSHBERGThere are only two things you have to worry about , Nat . The President wants this . I want this . His reasons . . . ? As usual I have n't a clue . Another look at Bruno . &nbsp; GEN . HERSHBERGI want it because I think she deserves it . Put it under a microscope .

Coordinate with him . &nbsp; BRUNOSir , might I inquire why Colonel Gartner was . . . &nbsp; GEN . HERSHBERGNo . Captain Banacek will Fax you Colonel Serling 's itinerary . You 're excused .

There is a collection of little bottles on Serling 's tray , all empty . He is reading Walden 's file . There are tears in his eyes . The stewardess comes by and sees the tears .

Horrible photos of the results of bad dental hygiene , an illustration of proper brushing . Serling turns the disgusting photos to face the wall . The room is filling up with eleven men , all talking excitedly . It is a reunion of sorts . Hugs , unashamed tears and endless talk . " What have you been doing ? " " Going to meet with us after ? " " You 're getting fat , man . " A man in civilian clothes enters and is instantly surrounded by the others . " Where you been ? " " How 's civilian life ? " " How are the legs ?

Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded . They all try to see . Over the river , up the slope and across the ridge . The sound comes from there . And over the crest of the ridge appears a tank . A Russian T-55 . It pauses at the ridge . Then with a clatter and roar , comes up over the ridge and to the down slope . It stops . Then the turret swivels . Until the gun points at the helicopter . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) It 's a very strange feeling to be sitting there and watch a big gun like that make adjustments to blow you away . And the gun does that , with whirrs and cranks . A little elevation . A little windage . Then . . . BOOM ! The gun fires . The tank jerks back . The tail section of the helicopter disintegrates ! There is a huge cloud of dust in front of the tank , thrown up by the concussion . With little wind it just hangs there , dissipating slowly . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) All we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see to adjust . That 's when , as ranking officer , I made my decision . The Lieutenant steps out of the helicopter , waving his white handkerchief . He takes a couple of steps toward the tank . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) I figured we 'd held out as long as we could and that the lives of the men on board . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( V.O. ) You do n't have to make excuses for your actions to me , Lieutenant .  --  25  --  &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) I know , sir , I know . It 's just . . . Well , it did n't make any difference . The cloud of dust finally settles in front of the tank . They can see Chelli and the white flag of surrender . And the tank machine gun cuts loose . The Lieutenant is hit in his good leg . He goes down . Two men , wounded themselves , run and haul him back to the chopper . The tank 's big gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( V.O. ) We were just target practice for their big gun . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) A turkey shoot . It fires ! BOOM ! This one misses - too far off the nose of the chopper . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) Now they had us bracketed . All they had to do was adjust for somewhere in the middle and we were dead meat . The Medic fires at the tank with the M-16 . The rounds just bounce off . Lt. Chelli stops him and looks up at the sky . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) And then we heard it . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) There 's something about an inbound Huey . . . And suddenly up the river comes an American Huey helicopter . The unmistakable red cross of Medevac on its side . It buzzes the downed Blackhawk and tank then does a steep U-turn and comes back . The men in the Blackhawk cheer . Elation takes them past the pain of their wounds . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( V.O. ) Did it take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the bat .  --  26  --  &nbsp; JENKINS ( V.O. ) Instantly , every rag head ground pounder wanted a piece of that bird . The enemy troops fire at the chopper , but the only real indication are the tracers arcing through the sky . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) When the Huey came back this time it returned fire . Someone with a 240 . &nbsp; EGAN ( V.O. ) That Altameyer guy . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) We did n't know at the time but , yes , SP/5 Altameyer . The ground troops went for cover . BOOM ! The tank fires again . The cheering men in the Blackhawk are blown to bits . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) That round killed the Medic , Raleno , Gerspach . . . Egan lost his legs . . . Chaos . Men dying , bleeding , screaming - praying . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) We tended the wounded as best we could . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) And waited for the next round to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Huey doing at this time ? &nbsp; EGAN ( V.O. ) It circled back to go over the tank again . &nbsp; JENKINS ( V.O. ) Then they threw something overboard at the tank . The Huey banks and over the tank , a dark square object plummets out the open door and lands a few yards away . The Huey bucks and turns . One of the wounded men directs the Lieutenant 's attention to the chopper.  --  27  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( V.O. ) Threw or it fell off ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) Could n't tell the first time . &nbsp; JENKINS ( V.O. ) Did n't know what the hell it was . Found out later it was a fuel pod . &nbsp; EGAN ( V.O. ) Dead hit . It burst like a water balloon . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) J - jet fuel all over the tank . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) Then someone in the Huey fired a flare at the tank . And it blew . The tank is drenched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half out of the turret is yelling commands when he realizes what is going on . He tries to bail . Too late . The tank erupts in flames . The ground troops run away from the burning tank . KA-BOOM ! Something goes off inside the tank . Then another explosion , and another . The ammo inside cooks and blows . The tank disintegrates . Inside the crashed Blackhawk , the men cheer . INT . BARRACKS , DAY The men relive that moment with smiles and laughs . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDid you see what knocked the Huey down ? The mood darkens . &nbsp; LT . CHELLINo . EXT . RIVER , DAY Inside the Blackhawk the mood darkens as they see the Huey.  --  28  --  &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) We were yelling and screaming so much we did n't notice the Huey was even hit . &nbsp; JENKINS ( V.O. ) We just saw it spiral down and crash . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( V.O. ) How far away ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) Five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotor dead . It crashes . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) She hit hard . &nbsp; JENKINS ( V.O. ) Real hard . Surprised anyone survived . It takes a lot of time for the dust to settle . INT . BARRACKS , DAY &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThe sun set shortly after the Huey crashed . Was there any more ground fire ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLIThe tank was incapacitated  --  but we caught sporadic ground fire through the night . The Huey took most of it . It was between us and the enemy so . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou had no communications with the Huey ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLINo . As I said our radio was wasted . We tried shouting at it , but that just drew enemy fire , so we . . . stopped . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSo you spent the night waiting ?  --  29  --  &nbsp; JENKINSLongest night I ever spent . . . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIMonaco died during the night . It was cold . But . . . We heard voices from the Huey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ridge . A small firefight once during the night . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGCould you see into the Huey ? Were you able to discern what was happening there ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLINo . Some rocks hid the interior . We could n't see anything in daylight and most of our time there it was dark . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGAnd with dawn came a new attack ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLINot quite . The sun came up . We were pretty ragged by then . EXT . BLACKHAWK , MORNING The sun comes up . Lt. Chelli , weary to the bone , and a few men look up at the sky , at the ridge . On the ridge  --  enemy activity , heads popping up , guns laid on the ridge . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) On the ridge we saw forty , maybe fifty enemy . They began firing at the Huey mainly and moving toward it under the cover fire . The Huey returned fire for a second . Then nothing . &nbsp; EGAN ( V.O. ) Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V.O. ) A Huey , A Blackhawk and a pair of Cobras.  --  30  --  &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) And a big ass F-14 Tomcat . You never heard such a beautiful noise . The aircraft zoom overhead . Awesome , beautiful sights . The men on the downed Blackhawk cheer with what little strength they have . The Cobras strafe the ridge line . The Blackhawk and Huey land between the two downed aircraft . There is gunfire everywhere . &nbsp; EGAN ( V.O. ) Yeah . This horrendous noise . Huge . Sounded like every gun in the world . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) The enemy was letting loose with everything they had . &nbsp; THOMPSON ( V.O. ) And the Medevac crew was still banging away . The wounded are loaded into the Blackhawk . Three men run out of the crashed Huey and into the new one . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) All the wounded were loaded aboard . The dead were left behind . We were taking fire at the time . One of the Blackhawk medics was hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V.O. ) Again , I 'm not criticizing , Lieutenant , but why were the dead left behind ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) It was a hot LZ . The decision was made to leave the dead . By the commander of the rescue , I think . The wounded are loaded onto the Blackhawk and then both it and the Huey rise . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V.O. ) The last thing we saw was the Tomcat drop white phosphorus on the two crashed choppers.  --  31  --  An awesome display of burning white fire explodes the two choppers . &nbsp; LT . CHELLI ( V. O. ) Then we were out of there . The rescue choppers back away . INT . BARRACKS , DAY Serling is going through the file , reading pages . &nbsp; THOMPSONThank the Lord . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSoldier , you stated that you heard the Medevac " banging away " . They were returning fire ? &nbsp; THOMPSONYes , sir . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou saw this ? &nbsp; THOMPSONHeard it . I know the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AK or 240 . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGAnyone else hear the M-16 return fire after the rescue choppers touched ground ? Three hands go up , then a fourth , tentatively . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIColonel , this is n't just some Lessons Learned or post-action analysis , is it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo . Captain Walden has been recommended for the Medal of Honor . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIWell , I do n't know if it was Captain Walden or whoever  --  but that Huey and her crew saved our lives .  --  32  --  &nbsp; THOMPSONI would n't be here today . I know that . &nbsp; EGANWe all thought we were dead . &nbsp; JENKINSThat Huey could have climbed and just radioed in a location . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIAnd by the time someone would have gotten to us we would have been dead . &nbsp; THOMPSONThe Medal of Honor is not enough for what they did . &nbsp; EGANThey ought to give it to every soldier on that Huey . There are sounds of affirmation from the rest of the men . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're excused . They all rise and go back to conversing among themselves , making plans for the reunion dinner that night . Bruno bounces out of his chair . &nbsp; BRUNOThat was terrific stuff ! Terrific stuff ! We can use all that . I 'll need some background on these kids . . . men . Make sure we do n't have a wife beater or an illegal alien in the woodpile . Serling , gathering his papers , glares at Bruno . Bruno is oblivious . &nbsp; BRUNOBrave men , brave men . This must be particularly difficult for you , Colonel . Serling tightens up , angry .  --  33  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhat do you mean by that , Mister Bruno ? Exactly what do you mean by that ? &nbsp; BRUNOHaving me here . I know I 'm an albatross . You ever see that Monty Python skit , cracks me up . I 'm a pain in the ass , your ass , I know that . But it 's my job , sort of . This Medal , if Captain Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo one wins the Medal of Honor , Mister Bruno , they receive it . There are no Medal of Honor winners , it 's not a contest . Bruno pulls an IBM Thinkpad from his backpack . &nbsp; BRUNORight , right . That 's good , that 's real good . See ! That 's what I 'm here for . Serling walks out of the barracks , leaving Bruno behind . Section Details EXT . BARRACKS , DAY Lt.

CHELLISir , you had a remarkable career  --  before the . . . incident . I was wondering if perhaps you could give me a few hints in reference to getting on the fast track , like you . Lt.

CHELLII mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been for Al Bathra you 'd be a General now . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWell , I do n't know about any Army fast track , Lieutenant . I got Colonel the hard way , no West Point , no relatives in DC . . . The only fast track is combat and you need a war for that . &nbsp; LT . CHELLISure , sure . Well if I can find me a Rabbi like you got in General Hershberg . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGGeneral Hershberg and I never met before Desert Storm . I 'd hardly call him my Rabbi . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIIn any case , sir , I wanted to give you this . He hands Serling the envelope . Bruno joins them . &nbsp; LT . CHELLIIt 's an article I wrote for Military Review . It 's an operational assessment of the battle of Al Bathra . In it I propose three operational alternatives to your . . . the decision you made . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGOnly three ? &nbsp; LT . CHELLII thought you might like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you . Serling tries to give it back to the Lieutenant . &nbsp; LT .

I 'm sure you 've gone over the incident many times . There might be a solution here that you did n't think of . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI doubt it . I doubt it very much .

Bartender , white wine spritz. . . no , make it a beer , light . ( to Serling ) You do n't like me , you do n't want me around . I know that , but I 'm going to be here so let 's find an accommodation . Bruno leans toward Serling.  --  36  --  &nbsp; BRUNOYou know the White House did n't want you on this investigation because of your . . . history . But the General was adamant , so I said what the hell . Walden wins , gets the Medal , no one 's going to ask who checked the bonafides . No one will give a rat 's ass about you . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( smiling ) Thanks . &nbsp; BRUNOYou 're welcome . By the way , just to know where our sympathies lie . . . how do you feel about women in combat ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI do n't look at Captain Walden as a woman , or a man for that matter . She was a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Medal of Honor . Plain and simple . &nbsp; BRUNOPlain and simple . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGMister Bruno , I do n't think I can proceed on this inquiry , and notice I said " inquiry " , not investigation as you did , with your continued presence . The Blackhawk survivors ' testimony was informal and just background . When I go to the survivors of Captain Walden 's chopper I do feel that your presence may be a further hindrance . So , as for an " accommodation " , this is what I propose . I conduct the inquiry . You do n't . &nbsp; BRUNOI do n't think you understand my function in this " inquiry " .  --  37  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes , I do . You 're looking for your goddamn photo op . You do n't give a rat 's ass about Captain Walden , what she did at Al Kufan , the brave men we just talked to , or what the Medal means or stands for . All you give a rat 's ass about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handing the Medal to her parents because it will get you two minutes on the six-o'clock news and that translates into I do n't know how many votes or approval rating points . &nbsp; BRUNOVideotape . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGVideotape ? &nbsp; BRUNOVideo . Still photographs are old hat . Video , we live or die by it . You 're right , Colonel , I 'm not ashamed of my job . That videotape will do us all a lot of good . The President , the Army , me. . . and you , otherwise you would n't be here . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThen let me do my job . Alone . &nbsp; BRUNOWell , to be blunt , Colonel , there are those who think you might have a personal bias in this inquiry that my presence could ameliorate . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGBias . &nbsp; BRUNOYour Al Bathra incident . Serling takes a drink , looks at Bruno .  --  38  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThat was then . This is now . I have a mission .

You proceed in your inquiry and send me detailed reports of your findings , be available for follow-up , and keep an eye out for my angle on this . I 'll stay scarce . Acceptable ? &nbsp; BRUNOAcceptable . The doors open and Lt. Chelli and the survivors of the Blackhawk enter , full of camaraderie and good spirits . They take a large table in the back . Serling watches them and signals the bartender , slides a couple of bills across the bar . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI want to buy that table a round of drinks . Here . &nbsp; BRUNOLet me help . ( to bartender ) Do you take American Express ? No , that 's okay , I have cash . I 'll need a receipt . ( to Serling ) Just for my half , of course .

BOQ , NIGHT Serling enters the Bachelor Officers Quarters . He is tired , not physically , just drained . He gets to his room , opens the door . It sticks . There is a manila envelope wedged between the door and the floor . Serling pulls it out . Chelli 's article . Serling tosses it on the bed . He goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He opens it , realizes what he is doing , and determinedly screws the cap back on . Then sits on the bed , more tired then ever . He is sitting on Chelli 's envelope . Yanking it out from under his butt , he looks at it a moment , then opens the clasp . He starts reading . Outside , an Armored Personnel Carrier rolls by , that clanking roar all too familiar to Serling . INT . A DARK PLACE , NIGHT A man on fire , his face and hair aflame . He stares at you , accusation in his eyes . You raise a hand to keep him away . The hand bursts into flame . It is a torch , skin blistering . The burning man screams . You are inside a tank , M1A1 Abrams . The instruments glow green . Another man on fire scrambles from the hatch . The fire traces a lazy line across the bulkhead . It is headed to the ammunition stacks . The man screams at you again . The fire leaps upon the magazine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man is upon you - Lieutenant Boylar burning before your eyes .

He is somewhere else . Finally he comes back and tosses the article aside . Serling grabs the little bottle of booze and drains it . He tosses away the bottle in disgust . EXT . FORT BENNING , DAY Fort Benning , Georgia . Serling drives through the gates . EXT . AIRFIELD , DAY Big C-130 Hercules lumber down the runway and then , impossibly take to the air . Serling rides in a Humvee across the airfield , past a group of soldiers in parachutes waiting on the tarmac . The Humvee stops in front of the 264th Medical Company - Air Ambulance . There are a Huey and a Blackhawk helicopter on pads out front , more in the nearby hangar . Serling enters the Company HQ , a quonset hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORNING There is a SP/5 behind a desk . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGLooking for Major Teegarden . &nbsp; SP/5In the back , sir . He gestures . Serling goes into the back . MAJOR TEEGARDEN is playing a Gameboy with CAPTAIN COUSINS . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGMajor Teegarden , Nat Serling . I 'm doing the follow through on your Medal of Honor recommendation for Captain Walden . &nbsp; TEEGARDENReally ? About time . Gladtomeetcha . This is Captain Cousins . What took you so long ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI work at the Pentagon .  --  41  --  &nbsp; TEEGARDEN'Nuff said . Coke ? Coffee ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGCoffee 'd be nice . Black . Can you break down the events of 26 , 27 February , ' 91 for me ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENSure thing . I 'm on call if that 's okay . Let 's see . I sent out Dust Off Two , Warrant Officer Fowler , at about ten hundred hours to evac the troop from a vehicular accident . We were getting ready to move forward , provide support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGA routine run . &nbsp; TEEGARDENWell , kinda routine . We were in Iraq by then . Captain Fowler could n't fly above 100 feet , that was our ceiling . So the fly boys could go low for their bombing runs . Our radios lost contact below 250 , 300 . So we were deaf . And there was the dust and then the smoke from Kuwait , oil fields burning . Visibility was nil . So we were blind , too . And sand everywhere . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhen did you realize Fowler 's ship might be in trouble ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENWell , you sort of know how long a mission takes , how long enroute , the pick up , how long to the MASH , how long to return . I give ' em some leeway . I gave Fowler almost an hour . Then I called HQ . They confirmed the pick up . Then I got the MASH unit on the horn and found out Fowler had n't delivered . ( more )  --  42  --  &nbsp; TEEGARDEN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have put ' em down . He looks at Cousins . &nbsp; COUSINSSometimes the visibility was so bad you set down to wait it out . They usually blew over . &nbsp; TEEGARDENBut I called Air Rescue anyway . The SP/5 comes in . &nbsp; SP/5Major , we have a possible heat exhaustion on the small arms range . &nbsp; TEEGARDENDwayne , grab that for me . Captain Cousins puts away his Gameboy and runs out . Through the window Serling sees the crew join him at the Blackhawk . &nbsp; TEEGARDENHeat stroke can roll out of heat exhaustion . Heat stroke can kill . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHow did Captain Walden get involved in the search ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENShe came to me . The Blackhawk takes off outside . Teegarden watches it go . &nbsp; TEEGARDENWhen she first came to the unit , Walden rode co-pilot with Fowler during her orientation . They were friends . They 'd traded envelopes . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGTraded envelopes ?  --  43  --  &nbsp; TEEGARDENWhen we first got there , on the way over actually , we each wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come back . We did n't know what we were getting into . Saddam 's crack army , best in the world , in continuous control for years . We were . . . green . So we wrote these letters and traded them . You know , in case anything happens to me send this to my folks , my wife . . . I actually found Captain Walden 's letter in Fowler 's footlocker when we packed his . . . effects . I sent it to her folks . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGCaptain Walden and Fowler were close . &nbsp; TEEGARDENNo closer than anyone else . No romance or anything , if that 's what you 're implying . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'm not implying anything . &nbsp; TEEGARDENWe were all close . Just the few of us , four choppers and their crews . Most of the time we were off by ourselves . We were . . . yeah , close . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI was in a tank unit in Desert Storm . I know how close you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; TEEGARDENWe were all monitoring the rescue channels . Captain Walden came to me . Karen knew Fowler , knew his flying habits , thought she could retrace his route . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou agreed ?  --  44  --  &nbsp; TEEGARDEN ( angry ) Yes , we 're Medevac . Rescue is our business , too . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'm not questioning your decision , Major . So she went . &nbsp; TEEGARDENNot right away . I made her wait an hour in case Rescue came up with something . Then I said okay . I made her strap on the extra fuel pods . She was not to attempt evacuation . There were too many on Fowler 's Blackhawk for the Huey anyway . Walden 's mission was to spot Dust Off Two , go for altitude to call in the location , then render what aid they could until the rescue team arrived . Those were my orders . The SP/5 comes in . &nbsp; SP/5Sir , Medevac at Saint Mare Elyse . Bee sting . &nbsp; TEEGARDENRoger . On it . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGBee sting ? Teegarden starts out the door . &nbsp; TEEGARDENFor some people it could lead to anaphylactic shock . Could be fatal . Come along if you want . EXT . PAD , DAY Serling follows Teegarden out to the pad . The rest of the crew and co-pilot meet him . This is a team . They 've done this thousands of times . Serling is seated in the back , given a helmet , strapped in.  --  45  --  They take off . The dialogue throughout the flight is heard over the intercom . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDid you have any contact with Captain Walden after she left your base camp ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENWe lost contact after she was twenty minutes out or so . She was keeping low , like I said , our ceiling was down to give the jets a lower profile . She put down once because a dust storm degraded visibility . . . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou learned this on the radio ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENNo . That I learned after the action . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be interviewing the crew later . Why did you send along Specialist Altameyer and the machine gun ? Is n't that unusual for a Medevac ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENWell . . . There 'd been reports of aircraft taking ground fire along the Euphrates . Nothing of consequence . Could have been some trigger happy Bedouins , those people fire guns in the air like kids wave at trains . Plus , Walden 's mission was not to evacuate , but to locate and report . There was an MP unit next door to our base camp . Altameyer was always hanging around the company area . He had a hard-on for choppers . &nbsp; CREW CHIEFDo n't we all ?  --  46  --  Teegarden smiles at his Crew Chief . They are over the area . A ground soldier guides them in for the landing . The Medic bails and runs to where a group of soldiers circle a prone man . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSo the next time you heard anything of Walden 's situation . . . &nbsp; TEEGARDENIt was a rough night . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I do n't think anyone in the company got any sleep . At first light , Division Intelligence and Search and Rescue reported they had satellite infrared photos they thought might be our two birds . We cranked up and went in with the rescue party . I flew one Huey , Captain Liebman our other Blackhawk . The Medic comes running to the Huey accompanying a litter . The litter is put aboard . Serling looks at the man on the litter . He is all puffed up , red faced , gasping for air . &nbsp; MEDICLet 's get this one to the hospital , stat . He 's swelling like a blow fish . I 've poked him with some epinephrine , but we got ta get him some help before his throat swells shut . The chopper takes off . &nbsp; TEEGARDENRoger . He calls in to the hospital , briefing them on their patient . The man on the litter starts pulling on Serling 's arm in a panic . &nbsp; MEDICHold him , sir . Hold him still . Serling holds the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  47  --  &nbsp; MEDICSir , he 's not getting any air . I 'm traching him . The man struggles as the Medic tries to insert a tube through his throat . Serling calms him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou 're going to be okay , troop . Just relax . You 're in the best of hands . Just relax . Finally the tube is in and the man is getting air . The patient relaxes . Serling lets go of him and sits back down . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGUh. . . where were we ? What did you see when you got to the crash site ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENTwo wasted choppers . They were so shot up they looked like termites had been at ' em . I was surprised anyone was alive . They were encircled by a hundred maybe more of enemy troops moving in under cover of fire . Oh , and a wasted tank on the ridgeline . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou called in the Willy Peter strike ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENYes . It was a hot LZ . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walden 's Crew Chief told me that Captain Walden and her copilot WO Rady were both dead . . . well , we all saw the footage on CNN when they dragged our boys through the streets of Baghdad . I was n't going to let that happen to any of my people . . . especially a woman . And do n't think that 's a sexist remark . I knew these people . I. . . cared about these . . . They died . . . bravely . I was n't going to let anyone desecrate . . . So , yes , I called in the air strike . A cremation if you will .  --  48  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou never saw the bodies of Walden or Rady or the Blackhawk crew ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENNo , I did n't . I 've seen enough dead people . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou said there was enemy fire during the rescue . Did you hear any M-16 fire ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENM-16 , BB guns , they were tossing everything at us and we were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap gun from another  --  they all hurt people . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhen did you learn about the events that occurred on the previous night ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENAt the MASH . Altameyer , Ilario and Monfriez started talking . That 's when I wrote up the citation . I did n't expect the Medal of Honor would actually come through . Most of them get knocked down to the Silver Star or an Air Medal , but . . . I wanted everybody to know how extraordinarily this soldier had performed . They land at the hospital . Doctors and nurses are waiting on the pad . They hustle the patient into the Emergency Room . The Medic goes with them . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThen why did she do it ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENI . . . I do n't know . Does anyone ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou said she was aggressive . Was she a hot dog ?  --  49  --  &nbsp; TEEGARDENNo . Very conscientious . A highly motivated individual , but not a Nintendo jockey . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhy did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude and call in the location ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENAnd watch that tank chew up Fowler and his crew  --  the patients . People were in trouble . We help people in trouble . It 's our job . The Medic comes back with five Dr. Peppers . He tosses one to each of the men . They all drink - except for Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou put Altameyer , Ilario and Monfriez for the Silver Star and Air Medal . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes , and they deserved it . They received them . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGGood men ? &nbsp; TEEGARDENThe best . Drinks finished , Teegarden lifts the chopper off the pad . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThen why did you transfer them out of your unit after Desert Storm . &nbsp; TEEGARDENWell , Altameyer was n't mine in the first place , he was an MP . You 'll have to ask his CO . Ilario and Monfriez requested transfer - for a variety of reasons - their own . I had no reason to deny it . After what they 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They land at the airstrip . Teegarden shuts the Huey down .  --  50  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThanks , Major . I might call you back with some follow ups . &nbsp; TEEGARDENShe gon na get it ? The Medal of Honor ? The helicopter is still . They walk back to the quonset hut . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGIt always reflects well on a unit , and thusly the Commanding Officer when someone under their command is recognized . A career enhancement they call it in D. C. Teegarden looks at Serling , his anger growing . &nbsp; TEEGARDENYou 've got no cause to cast any doubt on the actions of Captain Walden and her crew , or me , for that matter . Not one bit . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo one knows that better than I Major . And he walks away . Section Details INT .

There is a photograph attached to her last evaluation . Front and side view . Captain Karen E. Walden  --  handsome , young . Serling looks at her face for a long time . Section Details EXT . RANGER SCHOOL , DAY Young men with shaved heads going through the disciplined hell of Ranger School , instructors barking at their heels like Chihuahuas on steroids . The students look haggard . The cadre , in their berets and starched fatigues , look like Army poster boys . Serling walks up to the Ranger Officer watching the training , talks to him . The Officer points up . Serling looks . A fifty foot tower , fast rope training - sort of a speeded up rapelling - men zip down the rope , some with more finesse than others . While STAFF SERGEANT ALTAMEYER , a black tough , harangues them . Altameyer is buff . There is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALTAMEYERGet down the rope , soldier ! Somebody 's shooting at you !

Get down there ! Move it ! Move it ! ( more )  --  54  --  &nbsp; ALTAMEYER ( continuing ) Move it ! C'm on ! What 's wrong ? ! You want to live forever ? ! You scared ? !

What are you afraid of ? ! All you can do is break your spine . It do n't hurt and you get a spiffy set of wheels .

Not much . She did n't play poker , for money , she said . She . . . was just another officer . He turns his back on Serling .

He bites off the tape . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHow long before you spotted the crashed Blackhawk ? &nbsp; ALTAMEYERHalf hour , forty minutes . Altameyer pauses , busies himself with his hands . It is evident Serling has to prompt him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSo tell me what happened . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWell , it all happened so fast , at first . Then it seemed to take forever . We came around a bend in the river - and there it was . Nervously Altameyer scrapes a fingernail across the wooden bench . Rhythmic scraping . pp. 24-40 &nbsp; pp. 59-77 EXT . HUEY , DAY The same rhythm , but the chop chop of the blades as the Huey zooms along the river thirty feet off the ground . The river runs through a wide canyon , the cliffs and ridges rise above the helicopter . Altameyer rides in the rear door , pilot 's side , machine gun at the ready . In back with him are CREW CHIEF ILARIO , a MEDIC , and SP/4 MONFRIEZ . Up front - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59  --  They follow the meandering water as it curves around a bend . And abruptly come across a battle . The crashed Blackhawk , survivors firing their weapons . Across the river bank  --  the tank . A round explodes from the tank gun . Flame belches from the cannon . Ground troops move toward the crashed Blackhawk , firing as they go . &nbsp; ILARIOThere they are ! &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZFuck , a tank ! They 're in deep shit . &nbsp; WALDENThere 's your target , Altameyer . Get it . Walden banks hard ! Standing on the skid , hanging from his safety strap , Altameyer watches the tank appear in the open void directly beneath him . He opens fire ! The bullets glance off the steel hide of the tank . The machine gunner on the tank unleashes a stream of fire at the chopper . The clank of bullets slapping into the aluminum shell of the Huey . A couple of holes appear magically under Monfriez ' feet . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZHoly shit ! We 're taking fire ! The tank cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Enemy fire peppers the Huey . &nbsp; WALDENI 'll try another pass ! &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWo n't do no good . I might as well be pissing on that tank . &nbsp; RADYWhat we need is an airstrike ! Bomb that fucker back to Baghdad . &nbsp; WALDENBy the time a jet jockey got here . . . &nbsp; ILARIOAnd we ai n't got no bombs .  --  60  --  &nbsp; WALDENMonfriez , unhook the aux fuel pod , prepare to toss it overboard ! Altameyer , put a hold on that 240 ! Get the flare gun from the survival kit . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZToss it overboard ? What the fuck ? &nbsp; WALDENDo it ! It 's a bomb ! Monfriez gets it , he goes to unhook the big square fuel pod . Altameyer scrambles to find the survival kit . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERSurvival kit . . . survival kit . . . Ilario finds it for him , passes him the flare gun and a flare . Altameyer fumbles the flare into the barrel . Walden banks the chopper to go back to the tank . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . Rady is twenty feet away from some kid . Their eyes meet . &nbsp; RADYClimb for altitude and call in our co-ords ? &nbsp; WALDENAfter we slow down the tank . Otherwise there wo n't be anything for them to rescue . Target coming up ! She nears the tank . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZReady here . The auxiliary fuel pod teeters on its perch . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERReady here . She banks over the tank . The tank machine gunner lets loose . Tracers arc to the chopper , whistle through the doorway , a few plunk into the side and front window . &nbsp; WALDENChoose your moment !  --  61  --  Monfriez drops the pod ! The Huey jumps up in the air with the weight loss ! Altameyer is scared . The pod misses the tank by twenty feet . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZShit ! Shit ! &nbsp; WALDENWe 'll try again . Prepare the starboard pod . Right away . Rady , we flying ? &nbsp; RADYNo damage yet ! None that 's stopping us ! He looks at the gash in the window near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALDENAltameyer ! &nbsp; ALTAMEYERReady ! &nbsp; WALDENHave another flare ready in case you miss . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI wo n't . &nbsp; ILARIOI got one . &nbsp; WALDENHere we go !

The gunner fires at them ! Tracers chew at the Huey ! Soldiers on the ground fire up at them ! Monfriez drops the pod . The chopper lurches ! The pod bursts upon hitting the tank . A direct hit ! Gasoline spews everywhere .  --  62  --  &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZGot it ! Altameyer fires the flare gun . It strikes the tank . The tank bursts into flame . The soldiers onboard the Huey cheer , shout , yell in triumph ! But only for an instant . They are in trouble . Walden frantically fights the controls . The chopper tail is out of control . &nbsp; WALDENGrab something ! Hold on ! Rady , call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair , blood pouring down his chest . The window in front of him is shattered by bullet holes ! Walden switches channels on the radio . Ilario straps into the seat . Monfriez hooks up . &nbsp; WALDENMayday ! Mayday ! Dust off Three is going down ! Mayday ! They crash ! They hit hard ! It is awful quiet for a moment . Dust settles . A hot engine ticks as it cools . A moan . A little movement . Altameyer hangs by his safety strap outside the chopper door , the 240 dangling over his head . The barrel is inches from his nose . He skitters out of the way . It hurts to move . He gets up painfully . The chopper has splayed its skids , sits in an angle . The rear rotor is imbedded in the roof , protruding inside . Walden , unbuckled , is bending over Rady . &nbsp; WALDENIlario , Rady 's hurt ! Ilario is fumbling with his straps . Monfriez is hanging out the other door . BOOM ! The tank blows . Secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small figures on the ridgeline begin to fire . Rounds pock the Huey , kick up grit on the rocks between the Huey and the ridge . &nbsp; WALDENAltameyer , get the 240 working ! With Ilario 's help she gets Rady into the back of the helicopter . Ilario goes to work on him . Altameyer unbungies the machine gun . &nbsp; WALDENMonfriez , check for fire ! He does that while Walden goes back up front to check the radio . Altameyer returns fire .  --  63  --  &nbsp; WALDENThis is Dust Off Three . This Dust Off Three . Acknowledge , all channels . This is Dust Off Three . She clicks through all channels . Nothing . &nbsp; WALDENIlario ? Altameyer , easy on the ammo . We might be here a while . The three conscious men look at her . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZNo fire , fuel tanks intact . &nbsp; WALDENIlario ? Rady . . . &nbsp; ILARIOHe 's in a bad way . Lung shot . Not much I can do here . She bends over Rady , wipes the blood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ILARIOSuperficial . Radio ? &nbsp; WALDENDead . She turns to survey the scene . Coming down the ridge carefully , under cover fire , is the enemy . She looks the other way . Across the river , three hundred meters or more , is the crashed Blackhawk . A few men there can be seen looking at the Huey . &nbsp; WALDENIlario , could Rady manage if we carried him to the Blackhawk ? &nbsp; ILARIOI do n't know , Captain , it might kill him . He might die in the next fifteen seconds just laying there . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZI 'm not sure we can make it .  --  64  --  Walden looks at Monfriez , who has his M-16 out and is checking to see if it 's loaded . He points . Four or five enemy soldiers have positioned themselves up the river behind a pile of rocks between the Huey and the Blackhawk . Someone from the Blackhawk fires on them . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWe try to get there we walk right into their guns . Carrying Rady we might as well just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over Altameyer 's shoulder . The enemy troops have stopped moving , finding cover in the rocks below the ridgeline . Occasionally one of them shoots . The bullets punch holes in the chopper , but the main body is protected by a outcropping of stone . Altameyer returns fire . Short two or three-round bursts from the 240 . &nbsp; WALDENAmmo ? &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI got this belt and another five hundred . &nbsp; WALDENI guess we wait . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZFor what ? &nbsp; WALDENSearch and Rescue . She looks at the men . They do n't feel a bit of her confidence . Actually , neither does she . Machine gun fire . Everyone ducks , then looks up at the ridge . One enemy soldier with no live target is firing at the Huey 's tail . Full magazines emptied in one long blast , perforating the aluminum tail . Laughter , then another long burst . BURRUPP ! Section Details INT . LOCKER ROOM , DAY Altameyer 's fingernail has cut a groove in the wooden bench top . Each scrape of his fingernail creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees that Serling is watching the nervous scraping .

Infantry ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGTanks . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou would n't get me in no tank . Death traps . There you are sitting on five hundred gallons of diesel fuel , a couple hundred rounds of high explosive artillery in your ass pocket . We saw a lot of dead tanks with crispy critters hanging out of them over there . Know what I mean ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI know what you mean . Serling goes somewhere else for a second , then yanks himself back . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGTell me what happened during the night . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERNot much . The Captain put us on two-hour watches , but there was n't no need . None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The four of them sit with the wounded man , peering out at the night . Altameyer with the 240 and Ilario with his Beretta pistol in his lap , at one door . At the other door , Monfriez cradles the M-16 while Captain Walden has her own pistol in hand .  --  66  --  &nbsp; WALDENI wish the moon would come out . She looks up . There is a hint of the moon behind the clouds when they thin . &nbsp; ILARIOYou think Air Rescue will come tonight ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZMost likely they 'll wait for first light . &nbsp; WALDENWe just have to hold our water until morning . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI can hear them out there , moving and talking - when you people are n't gabbing . &nbsp; WALDENThen I suggest everybody . . . BAM ! She shoots , right past Monfriez ' head . An Iraqi soldier falls , firing his weapon . Suddenly the Huey is under attack from all sides ! They hardly see the enemy except when he is lit up by his own gunfire . A small firefight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big blast of noise . Then silence . The enemy can be heard scurrying away . The metallic clatter as Walden fumbles to reload her Beretta . She fumbles because her left arm is shot up , in her forearm a bone splinter pokes through the bloody hole . She has another bullet in her stomach . She gets the Beretta loaded one-handed , then discovers the stomach wound . &nbsp; WALDENShit . Then rouses herself . &nbsp; WALDENIlario , you hit ? You okay ? Monfriez ? Altameyer ? &nbsp; ILARIOI 'm okay . I 'm okay . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZMy ear . . .  --  67  --  It 's bloody , the tip shot off . He touches it .

Altameyer takes a breath , back in the real world . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYeah . Was n't that enough for one night ? He is suddenly belligerent , realizes it , and covers with a smile . He nervously rubs the scar on his forearm . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWe could continue this tomorrow if it 's getting to you . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWhat ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGIf these things are getting too close . . . you know .

I got ta get back . He gets up and walks away . Serling is left on the bench , staring at Ilario 's retreating back . Ilario glances over his shoulder a few times , then goes inside the Medical building . Serling , puzzled , concerned , turns to watch a tiny girl , only three or four , cannonball off the high board . Section Details INT . OFFICE , DAY Serling sits in front of a typewriter  --  just staring at the blank sheet of paper . He does n't want to type the report  --  maybe he ca n't . He looks away from the paper to Walden 's file photograph . A PFC walks over . &nbsp; PFCSir , Fax is all yours now .  --  94  --  Serling is jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to type . As he works he becomes more and more disturbed . EXT . THE ALAMO , DAY A little mud building trying to hold it 's own in the city of San Antonio . The tour guide shows the tourists the mark where Colonel Travis drew a line in the dirt . &nbsp; TOUR GUIDEThe Alamo reminds us that we Americans have always had heroes . In moments of crisis , there are those among us who step forward and do the right thing , the brave thing , without regard for their own lives . . . Serling listens to as much as he can . Then he leaves  --  in a hurry . EXT . CANALS , NIGHT Serling is drunk . He does n't stagger , but he walks like in a dream . Through the tourists , the lovers , past the restaurants , the boats . It all swirls around him . He leans against a tree , slides down the trunk  --  to vomit into the water . Two kids stare at him , ice cream cones in hand . &nbsp; GIRLYou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's drunk . Drunk as a skunk . &nbsp; GIRLDo skunks get drunk ? How ? Serling looks at them . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI got kids . The Mother comes to get them . Serling looks at her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI got kids . It 's a plea for something . Understanding . Forgiveness.  --  95  --  &nbsp; MOTHERA lot of good you 're doing them right now . And stomps off with the little ones in tow . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou 're right . She 's right . And he starts to sob . Passersby try to ignore him . INT . HOTEL ROOM , DAY Serling is sprawled on the bed , passed out in his clothes . There is a knock at the door  --  it just nudges his consciousness . Another knock , louder , breaks through the fog . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGLater ! The knocking becomes pounding . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGOkay , okay , okay . When 's checkout ? He looks at the clock  --  7:41 a.m.  --  and groans . He stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fuck . . . He goes to the door , leans against the wall to open it . There is Bruno , fresh as a morning bloom . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou , you little . . . Serling stops himself , tries to wake up . Bruno strides inside . &nbsp; BRUNOChrist on a crutch , Serling , you look like ten pounds of shit in a two-pound baggie . And you smell like a bus station toilet . Serling goes into the bathroom , splashes his face with cold water . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhat the hell do you want , Bruno ?  --  96  --  Serling sees stains on his shirt , strips it off . &nbsp; BRUNOSo ! She 's a coward . The bitch cut and run . That brings Serling up short . He looks at Bruno hard , finds the bottle of aspirin in his toilet kit , eats a handful . Bruno winces sympathetically . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThat 's what Ilario stated . &nbsp; BRUNODo you believe him ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI have n't spoken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . It 's done . As far as I 'm concerned one eyewitness calls her a coward  --  she 's a coward . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNot necessarily . &nbsp; BRUNOTrue , but we certainly ca n't give her the fucking medal if we have a loose cannon like Ilario rolling around the deck . We could wind up looking down the muzzle . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou do handle a metaphor well , Bruno , but I 'm not done with my investigation . &nbsp; BRUNOInquiry . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThere 's something hinky about Ilario . &nbsp; BRUNOI do n't care . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI do .  --  97  --  &nbsp; BRUNOOf course you do . You want her to be a hero . Hell , you need her to be a hero . She 's the hero you were n't . If she 's a coward , okay , a fuck-up , then she 's just like you . And then there 's no hope , right ? No hope . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDo n't apply your K-Mart psychoanalysis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger seething . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI fucked up , nobody knows that better than I do . I made a command decision in a combat environment under hostile fire  --  and I was wrong . That 's the chance you take when you make decisions . That 's the way it works . You make decisions and you hope to hell you 're right more than you 're wrong . Just like any other job  --  like your job . Except when a combat officer fucks up  --  people get killed . It 's a war . People get killed . And people make mistakes . You try not to make the same mistake twice . I 'm a good officer , a great combat officer . I was cleared of any charges . It was an accident . I 've moved on ! I wish to fuck everybody else would . &nbsp; BRUNOSo you were a degenerate drunk before Desert Storm ? Good for you . That strikes deep and Serling lashes back . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'm continuing my assignment . &nbsp; BRUNOI would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if I say it , the President says it . ( more )  --  98  --  &nbsp; BRUNO ( continuing ) The President says it and your boss says it . I 'm surprised your orders have n't come in yet . Maybe they have , if you 'd been conscious enough to take your messages  --  or my calls . See you in D.C. Bruno heads for the door . &nbsp; BRUNOJust for my own curiosity , were you drunk that night in the desert ? Serling turns on him , full of fire , ready to kill . Bruno backpedals to the door . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou talk about cowards , you political weasels have a lot of room to talk . You 've never made a decision without a committee , a think tank , two consultants , and a nationwide poll . Or had to stand by it . You guys flip-flop more than a goldfish out of his bowl . . . Bruno scurries out the door shouting . &nbsp; BRUNOYou 're done , Serling ! And with Bruno gone Serling runs out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room . His eyes fall on the phone , the message light blinking . INT . HOTEL LOBBY , DAY Serling checks out . &nbsp; DESK CLERKYour receipt and , sir , you had these messages logged with the Operator . The Clerk gives Serling several message slips and his receipt . Serling tosses the message slips into a trash receptacle and leaves . pp. 59-77 &nbsp; pp. 99-119 EXT . ST . LOUIS , MISSOURI , DAY The Arch sweeps across the sky above St. Louis and the Mississippi . Serling drives his rental car across the bridge to Granite City , Illinois . EXT . GRANITE CITY , DAY Serling parks across the street from a gun store  --  Kane and Greene Guns . Serling in civvies , walks inside . INT . GUN SHOP , DAY Del Monfriez , fortyish , wearing a pistol on his belt , like all the other salesmen , is at the counter with a customer . &nbsp; CUSTOMERHow late you open ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZ'Til nine . Like they say at the girls school  --  lights out at nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol off the counter and aims it at the wall , holding it sideways . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWhere 'd you learn to hold a pistol , " Boys in the Hood " ? Seen too many of them black gangsta flicks . Always holding it like that , sideways , no wonder they never hit nothing , always full auto , of course , you hold a pistol like that , you ai n't gon na hit nothing . That 's why they need them splatter guns , MAC-10 's and shit . That 's where the sights are , on top . No wonder they have so many innocent drive-bys , ca n't hit nothing , yanking the weapon like they were pulling their pud . He takes the pistol back and demonstrates an exaggerated gangsta grip . He gives it back to the customer , turns to Serling . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZHelp you , mister ?  --  100  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGColonel Nat Serling , you 've already heard about me . Monfriez gives Serling a good looking over . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here . Monfriez leads Serling through the store , into the back , past the inventory to a small indoor range . INT . INDOOR RANGE &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZHey , Colonel , you heard about the Polish proctologist , uses two fingers so he can get a second opinion . He waits for the laugh , sees he 's not going to get it , sits down at the bench where a pistol and a box of ammo lay . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZI know why you 're here . I 'm telling you straight out  --  I made my statement . It 's in writing . I do n't got ta say diddly more . I do n't work for Uncle Sam anymore . I got this store , half of it anyway . You know how they make Mexican shishkabob ? They shoot an arrow into a garbage can . He shoots at the target , looks at the results , fiddles with the gunsights . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhy 'd you leave the service after fourteen years ? Why not pull the full twenty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't been in it long enough to understand . Know the definition of a Jewish nympho ? She does it once a month whether she wants to or not . He shoots again , adjusts sights again .  --  101  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'd like you to tell me what happened , what you actually saw . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZLike I said , you got it on paper . I got nothing to add . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGCan I ask a few questions ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZGo ahead , but remember what the bride said on her wedding night , " Do n't ask me no questions I wo n't tell you no lies . " Hear about the Polack who bought a rowing machine ? He woulda drowned if the lake had n't been frozen over . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHow long were you Captain Walden 's Crew Chief ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZJust a few weeks . When she got to Saudi her regular Crew Chief got the chicken pox second day over . Kept a clean ship though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hit it off . I 'll be honest . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhy not ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZThere 's this kind of woman , you do n't just meet them in the Army . They want a man 's job , they figure the way to be is tougher than a man . I do n't fault ' em none . It 's a tough row to hoe , but they end up being one thing . . . He looks to Serling to finish . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZ. . . a bitch . You know , like that Margaret Thatcher , full tilt flaming bitch . He shoots . Then as an afterthought , a punctuation , again .  --  102  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWas she a good officer ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZShe was alright . Hey , she could fly . That was her job . But , hell you can train a ten year old to fly a UH1 , that do n't make them Norman Fucking Schwartzkopf . She got on my ass , but I put her right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who aims . BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! BAM ! Serling empties the magazine at the target . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZNice shot group . Yeah , after I sighted it in . You done with your questions ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYes , you are . You 're done now . He walks out , carrying the pistol . Serling follows . INT . GUN SHOP &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhy did you make up that statement ? &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZThe other two weepy ass wipes talked me into it . Look , she gets the Medal . Fine . Fine by me . Lotta good it 's gon na do her . Shit , maybe I can sell my story to People magazine . Maybe a TV movie . Otherwise this whole thing ai n't worth the hole in a chicken 's ass to me . Goodbye . Browder , call Dr. Witkin , tell him his pistol 's sighted in . Serling does n't leave .  --  103  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you get a hang fire ? When you pull the trigger and the round does n't go off ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWait , with your weapon pointed in a safe direction . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYou know why ? Sometimes the primer just cooks . Could be a slow burner . It could still go off . And if you open your weapon to take the round out . . . ? It might blow up in your face . Leave this round in the chamber , Colonel . Leave it be . Serling looks at him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou just threatened me , did n't you , Monfriez ? I work at the Pentagon so I 'm kind of slow on the uptake , but I do recognize a threat when I hear it . Let me respond this way . He leans over the counter into Monfriez ' face . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI may be an officer and , therefore , a gentleman by proclamation , but before I joined up I was a Chicago street kid . I fought my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every night . I lived in a battle zone and firefights were just background noise . Monfriez turns away . Serling yanks him back  --  hard ! &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSo , now that I 'm in civilian clothes and declaring myself off duty I have no compunction whatsoever to taking you outside and tearing you a new asshole .  --  104  --  Serling is suddenly very scary . Monfriez ' hand slides toward his gun . Serling 's hand shoots out and grabs Monfriez ' wrist . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGAnd if you think that gun is going to help you  --  do n't . Because I 'll break your fucking arm before you clear the holster . You 'll be hearing from me , Mister . And he turns and leaves . Monfriez trembles with rage . Section Details INT . LIVING ROOM , DAY Outside a little girl , ten or so , plays in the yard with some friends . They are making chalk outlines of their shadows . Serling , in uniform , watches through the picture window . GERALDINE and JOEL WALDEN sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . &nbsp; GERALDINESometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and asks if her mama 's come home yet . Otherwise . . . I read somewhere that if a child does n't see a person die or dead , like in a casket , that the person is n't really dead for them . That would be nice , would n't it ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI do n't know how to ask this properly , but did your daughter have a. . . background of . . . heroics ? &nbsp; GERALDINENo . No . Just an ordinary girl . Just our Karen . &nbsp; JOELA little more stubborn than most . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'm just trying to . . . understand her .  --  105  --  &nbsp; GERALDINEShe was n't a remarkable girl . . . woman . To us she was , of course , but by most standards , I guess  --  nothing much remarkable about her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWell , she was a female helicopter pilot . That 's still rare enough to be remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fair , when she was . . . eleven . &nbsp; GERALDINETwelve . Seventh grade . &nbsp; JOELThere was a helicopter there , a small one , with the bubble up front , we called it a whirlybird . The fella , the pilot , was selling rides . I bought Karen a ticket . It was a short ride , but when she came down . . . I do n't think she ever came down , actually . After that she was . . . up there . &nbsp; GERALDINEShe went back every day for the rest of the Fair . Used up all her 4-H savings . &nbsp; JOELShe did n't say much after the fair , not a peep . Did n't go collecting models of helicopters or go to air shows or nothing . &nbsp; GERALDINEJust shows up at the dinner table one day , just before graduation . She 's joined the Army , she 's going to fly helicopters . I was pushing her to be a nurse . She was always so independent . &nbsp; JOELGot that from her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so proud when she got her wings . We went to the graduation . The little girl , ANNE MARIE , comes in . She looks like her mother . &nbsp; ANNE MARIEGramma , can I make some Kool- Aid ? She looks at Serling , his uniform . It is a hard look for a little girl . Serling is uncomfortable . &nbsp; GERALDINESure , Anne Marie . You know where it is . The girl runs off , with another hard glance at Serling before she is gone . &nbsp; GERALDINESorry , but the young man who came to tell us about Karen was dressed just like you . She misses her mama . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI understand . I have kids of my own . &nbsp; JOELHer father is in Michigan . He and Karen divorced after only a couple of years . He wanted Karen to quit the Army . My thinking was he never got over Karen not taking his last name . We have custody . &nbsp; GERALDINEThank the Lord . Anne Marie is our saving grace . You have children , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do it all for . Treasure them while they 're here , Colonel . While you can . There 's not much to say after that . They are all quiet . Children 's laughter filters in from outside . &nbsp; JOELGod , how I love that sound .  --  107  --  He smiles . So does Nat . EXT . WALDEN HOUSE , DAY The Waldens escort Nat to his car . He carries a foil- wrapped package . Serling opens the car door , takes out his keys . &nbsp; JOELIf she gets this medal will we meet the President ? Serling is a bit uncomfortable . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGProbably . &nbsp; JOELI 've got something to say to him . &nbsp; GERALDINEJoel . . . &nbsp; JOELI know that Kuwait thing was n't his cross to bear . I know that . But I want him to know something . If he gets ready to send our kids off to fight he better have tried everything he could to avoid it first . I 'm talking negotiating like it was his own life  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while there , we thought twice before sending our kids in harms way . Lately , though , it 's more like every time some half-assed politician starts dipping in the opinion polls he invades some pisspot country . And American kids die . If he 's going to do that  --  it damned sure better be worth it . Damned sure . He is surprised at his own passion . He calms down . &nbsp; JOEL ( softly ) That 's what I want to tell him . Serling shakes the man 's hand .  --  108  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI think you should . There is a child 's scream . The girls run out from behind the house yelling , " Snake ! Snake ! Snake ! " . &nbsp; JOELI better go check . Probably just a garter snake , but . . . Nice meeting you , Colonel . Joel goes after the girls . Serling and Geraldine watch him . &nbsp; GERALDINEI 'm sorry about the speech , Colonel . He . . . he just does n't want Karen to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATHANIEL SERLINGI know . She did n't , though . She saved all those men 's lives . I wish you could meet them . They . . . they appreciate what your daughter did . &nbsp; GERALDINEI 'd like that , actually . ( beat ) There is a possibility she wo n't receive this medal . . . Serling is uncomfortable . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes . &nbsp; GERALDINEWell then , in that case , could you give this to . . . Oh , I do n't suppose you can give it to the President himself , but to someone who will . . . treat it with respect . She hands him a wrinkled , weathered , crinkled envelope . Serling stares at it . He knows the stationery  --  PX Unit designation . He knows what it is . &nbsp; GERALDINEIt 's the letter Karen wrote to us before . . . the one she left with Captain Fowler . Captain Teegarden sent it to us with Karen 's things . ( more )  --  109  --  &nbsp; GERALDINE ( continuing ) Someone who is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'll do my best . There is another squeal from the girls and Serling sees Joel dangling a little snake in his hand to the squeamish delight of the girls . Geraldine hugs Serling and he gets into his car and drives away . EXT . ROAD , DAY Serling has pulled his car over to the side of the road . There is a clearing with a picnic table . He is sitting at the picnic table reading the letter . It moves him deeply . Section Details INT . HOTEL ROOM , NIGHT The usual Holiday Inn motif . Serling sits in front of the coffee table .

I read your Ilario report . It does n't exactly . . . Serling jumps in and cuts him off . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI do n't think , sir , that he 's all that truthful .

OBSTACLE COURSE , NIGHT The Rangers are going through the obstacle course , a big muddy field with barbed wire constructions , culverts , tunnels and anything else that can make going difficult . Then there are the explosions tossing up mud and the gunfire from an M-16 wielding cadre . The most unpleasant one hundred yards you 'll ever traverse in your life . The students scramble through it in teams . One team leader makes it . Or thinks so . Altameyer gets in the team leader 's face . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWhat the fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? The team leader turns to show his men . But Altameyer points to the course . One man hopelessly tangled up in the barbed wire , left behind . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou do n't leave a man behind ! Look at me when I 'm talking to you , soldier ! You never leave a man behind ! Never ! You 're brothers ! He depends on you ! You depend on him !

Altameyer is shocked . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYou lied to me , Sergeant .  --  115  --  Altameyer does n't say anything for a moment , playing it tough . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWhat you gon na do , sir , make me join the Army ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGIt 's a Court Martial offense , making false statments on awards documentation . But we do n't want to dance to that tune do we , Sergeant ? &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWhat do " we " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERLINGTalk . Altameyer looks around , suspicious and paranoid . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERHow about we talk someplace private . I 'll drive . Altameyer heads for his car . Serling hesitates , then follows . They get into the Saleen Mustang . Altameyer drives off the Post . INT . MUSTANG &nbsp; ALTAMEYERMight lose my gig with the Rangers . C.O. 's pissed at me . Probably send me to the regular Infantry . That 's okay . Let him . Infantry man . It 's not a career , it 's a shitty job . When you join up do they tell you in the job description that you 're supposed to kill people ? I mean , you 'd think that 's a given , but . . . He takes a bottle of liquor from under the passenger seat uncaps it , takes a big swig . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERDo n't give me any shit about drinking and driving , sir . I 'm not in the mood . Have some .  --  116  --  He offers the bottle to Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo , thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after this bottle . He laughs . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWhat are you trying to tell me , Sergeant ? &nbsp; ALTAMEYERSoon as I figure out what it is I will relay that information . You ever kill anyone , sir ? That 's a big question for Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou know , you can talk about killing somebody . Wolf talk , you know . " I 'll kill you motherfucker , I 'll waste your ugly ass . " We all say it . But killing somebody . . . it 's a hard thing to do . Easy to pull the trigger . Hard to live with . Know what I mean ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI know exactly . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI killed people that day . That night . Out in the desert . I do n't remember much about them . Little figures falling over . I saw a couple of faces , but none stayed . A rag-head with a mustache , I can remember him if I try . But Captain Walden 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me whenever I close my eyes . Nothing gets rid of her . Dope , booze . . . praying . Even tried that . Nothing works . He empties the bottle , tosses it out the window .  --  117  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGAre you telling me you . . . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI 'm telling you shit . Just shut the fuck up and listen . . . sir . He laughs , but it does n't work . This is a tortured man . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERIt 's the grey areas that get you . You know , right or wrong , black and white . . . Who 'd ever think killing would be a grey area . It 's wrong to kill someone . That 's one of the black and whites , one of the Ten Commandments . Then you get in the Army . You kill people . It 's part of the job , they say . You kill someone , the Army says it 's okay  --  then it 's okay . Maybe that makes it okay for them , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI think so . Altameyer looks at him , desperate for help . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERTell me , sir , tell me . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGIt 's a struggle every day , finding out what 's right or wrong . Most people do n't even want to wade into those waters . That 's why we have religion , Codes of Conduct , to sort it out for us . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERBut they do n't help a bit when it cuts to the bone , do they ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWell. . . they . . . No . What does this have to do with Captain Walden ? &nbsp; ALTAMEYEREverything . Everything .  --  118  --  He reaches under his seat , pulls out a .45 , aims it at Serling ! Serling stiffens . There is nowhere to go . He looks . They are speeding down a rural road . A train runs parallel to them . Altameyer punches it , passing the train . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI always liked trains . Since I was a kid . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I ever boxed pro , I was going to call myself Howard " Night Train " Altameyer . What do you think , Colonel , do n't that have a nice ring to it ? " Night Train " . He is ahead of the train , makes a turn , comes up to the tracks , stops on the tracks . Serling can see the train coming , light on . Serling 's hand goes to the door handle . Altameyer pokes the gun into Serling 's chest . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGAltameyer . . . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERShut up ! Sir . . . The train sounds the whistle , rushing at them . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI do love trains . Ai n't that whistle pretty ? Listen to it . It sounds again . The train is closer . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERBut a train off its track ai n't worth shit . It 's just . . . scrap iron . He pulls the gun away . The train is roaring at them . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI lost my tracks , sir . There in that desert . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; ALTAMEYERGET OUT ! Serling gets out . Altameyer turns the car , faces the oncoming train . Serling grabs Altameyer 's door . Altameyer floors it .  --  119  --  The Saleen Mustang kicks in the turbo . Serling is torn loose . The Saleen rushes at the train . The whistle sounds . Then they meet . A horrendous crash ! The Saleen disintegrates ! Explodes ! Serling has to run to get out of the way of the flying wreckage . The train slows as best it can with a loud screeching and hiss . Serling can only stare sadly at the mess left of Altameyer and his car . pp. 78-98 &nbsp; pp. 120-140 INT . MP STATION , NIGHT Serling , very tired , is on the phone in the MP headquarters , a police station with fatigues . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGWell , sir , I 'd like you to call the Fort Sam Houston Provost Marshall and have them detain Specialist Ilario. ( beat ) Substance abuse , trafficking . ( beat ) I do n't know if they 'll stick . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ( beat ) I think there 's grounds , yes , sir . ( beat ) Just hold him . I 'm on my way . ( beat ) Thank you , sir . I 'll call you from Texas . Sorry for the late hour . He hangs up , turns to an MP . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI need a ride to my car . EXT . FORT SAM HOUSTON , DAY Serling drives onto the Post . INT . BARRACKS , DAY Serling stands in front of a room where two MP 's are stationed . A First Lieutenant briefs him .  --  120  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANTWe found a whole drugstore in his foot locker , plus drug paraphernalia , needles and such in every little cubby hole . Like a packrat with a jones . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGBut no Ilario . &nbsp; LIEUTENANTNot hide nor hair . But we 're on the lookout . So are the San Antonio Police . Serling nods . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHow long are those souvenir shops open at the Alamo ? I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh forgot last time I was here . I 'll be back at say , 1800 hours . Your office ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANTFine . See you then , Colonel . Maybe we 'll have something by then . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGLet 's hope so . He goes out , tired and defeated . . EXT . THE ALAMO , DAY Serling stands in front of the Alamo again , bag of T-shirts in hand . He looks down . At his feet is a brass plaque . The line that Colonel Travis drew in the sand . &nbsp; MAN ( O.S. ) The line between the heroes and the cowards . Serling turns to look at the Man , who is talking to his son . &nbsp; SONDavy Crockett grew up in a log cabin , huh ? &nbsp; MANProbably , but you 're thinking of Abe Lincoln .  --  121  --  Serling looks at the Man and Boy as they tour the site . Spying a Park Ranger , a Latina , Serling walks over to her . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGExcuse me , but is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Canyon , Medina , and Calaveras . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( disappointed ) Three . . . Any of them have cabins around them ? &nbsp; RANGERAll of them , I think , sir . That 's no help to Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGBut there 's no Skull Lake ? &nbsp; RANGERCalaveras means skull , sir . There are a number of Spanish place names in Texas . . . But Serling is gone . EXT . CALAVERAS LAKE , DAY A beautiful morning on a likewise beautiful lake . Serling drives along the lake road reading mailboxes . He passes one , backs up . " Ilario " . He pulls into the driveway and parks . He gets out and goes up to the door , ready to knock . A gunshot ! Serling runs along the side of the cabin toward the lake itself . Ilario sits on the edge of the dock , a .22 rifle perched on his shoulder , a Remington Nylon 66 . He fires again ! At a bottle bobbing in the water . Another shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dock . Ilario , a haunted look in his eyes , hears the steps and turns .  --  122  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThis residence is n't listed on Post , soldier . &nbsp; ILARIOWhen I go on a weekend pass I do n't want anyone bothering me . I want peace . He stares meaningfully at Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI do n't that applies here , soldier . To be precise , you 're AWOL . Serling sits next to Ilario , a case of beer between them . &nbsp; ILARIODo n't call me soldier . Beer , sir ? Wish I had something stronger . God , I wish I had something stronger , but that ran out last night . Ilario offers a beer to Serling . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGNo , thanks . &nbsp; ILARIODo n't tell me you are n't drinking , Colonel . I can smell it on you . And you got to be doing some serious drinking for it to becoming out of your pores in the morning . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beer and tosses the empty into the water and shoots it . &nbsp; ILARIOAnother dead soldier sent to a watery grave . Ever wonder why they call an empty bottle a dead soldier ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes . Altameyer is dead . He committed suicide .  --  123  --  Ilario takes the news quietly , nodding to himself . He expected it . He empties another bottle , shoots at it . Misses . &nbsp; ILARIOHe should have tried drinking . I was never much of a head  --  dope or booze  --  before . Now . . . there does n't seem to be enough of it to do the job . Ilario fires . Hits it this time . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGHave you tried going straight ? &nbsp; ILARIOYeah , I know what that shit does to your body . . . Ca n't live without it . Can you ? Serling ca n't answer that question  --  and that fact saddens him . &nbsp; ILARIOYou know , I was trained to save lives . I volunteered for that job . I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to . . . do good , only good . Now I. . . I killed . . . I took a life , maybe more . Not counting the enemy lives . My own people . . . Ilario is torn apart , pulls out another beer . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGSo have I. . . &nbsp; ILARIOWhat ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI killed some of my own people . The investigation cleared me of all blame . We did n't know that the target signature of a tank being hit was the same as one firing . We never trained under live fire , of course , so . . . I killed some of my own men . I see them . I 'm stuck in time . 2200 hours , 26 Feb. , 1992 . I ca n't get past that night .  --  124  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLING ( continuing ) Boylar , Sacks , Blackburn . . . Pittman , I hardly knew Pittman , but now I remember every moment I ever spent with him . He had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I killed him . I was n't there , but I see him . I 'd have to be in that tank to have seen him , and if I was in that tank I 'd be dead . But I 'm not dead . I just get to see his face , all their faces for the rest of my life . Ilario stares at Serling . &nbsp; ILARIOYou poor bastard . You 're as bad off as me . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThat 's why I need you to talk to me. . . about Walden . I need to know . . . I 'm not sure what I need to know . Talk , Ilario , I 'll listen . Ilario drains another bottle , shoots , hits , sinks . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDo n't any kids swim here ? Ilario looks out at the water . &nbsp; ILARIOShit . Oh , fuck . He lays down the rifle , takes off his shoes , shirt . Ilario jumps into the water . Serling waits . He stares at the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the water . Serling pries off his shoes , staring at the water . Ilario breaks the surface ! Laughing . &nbsp; ILARIOScare you , Major ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGYes . Ilario saddens . &nbsp; ILARIOSorry.  --  125  --  He sets some broken glass he 's scooped up on the dock , dives again . EXT . DOCK , LATER The dock is littered with broken glass , bottle shards , a couple that are n't broken . Ilario sits on the side of the dock , holding a bleeding right hand by the wrist . Serling bandages him . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThis , I can fix . I 've been trained . &nbsp; ILARIOAll them OCS medic courses ? &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThree kids . . . Serling is saddened now . Ilario looks at him . &nbsp; ILARIODamn , Major . You came to me looking for some kind of answer did n't you ? Serling tries a smile , fails . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI ca n't deny it . &nbsp; ILARIOOh . . . I 'm so sorry , Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I. They look at each other for a moment . Ilario stands , sways , lightheaded . Serling braces him and walks him down the dock and back to the cabin . They sit on the porch . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI want to read you something . He pulls out Walden 's letter . Ilario 's breath is taken away .  --  126  --  &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDear Mom and Dad . Well , this is it , the big push  --  looks like it 's going to really happen . And I 'm afraid . Not of being hurt or killed . Well , kind of  --  but not much . What I am really afraid of is that I might let my people down , my crew . The wounded soldiers whose lives we try to save . . . Reading the letter is tough for Serling , too . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGThese people depend on me , they put their lives in my hands . I know I have the best equipment , this old , beat-up Huey has become like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm still scared of failing these people . I love them , I do . . . Ilario closes his eyes . FLASHBACK  --  ILARIO 'S P.O.V. During the reading of the letter Ilario sees flashes of Walden . She watches the crew play cards . Trying to shower and maintain some modesty in the jury-rigged shower stall . In flight , glancing back at him from the pilot seat . Presenting a cupcake birthday cake , candle lit , to him . Section Details EXT . CABIN , DUSK &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGI love you guys , too , but I have never experienced such a closeness to people I have nothing in common with . It 's hard to explain . ( beat ) If you get this letter it means I am dead . My only regret will be never to see you two again , and that I will never see Anne Marie grow up . But I know she is in good hands  --  the best . If anything does happen , my last thoughts will be of you three . ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing ) I only hope that I have made you proud , that I did my job , and did n't let down my country , my crew , and my fellow soldiers . I love you . Your daughter , Karen . Serling looks at Ilario . &nbsp; LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SERLINGDid she let you down , soldier ? Ilario , tears in his eyes , looks at Serling . EXT . BASE CAMP , SAUDI ARABIA , DAY Walden looks at her watch , then the sky . There is desert as far as you can see , a few Army tanks , MP 's , a few trucks . A little olive drab oasis . &nbsp; WALDENI 'm going to check with Teegarden again . Rady , Monfriez , Ilario and Altameyer play cards on the deck of the Huey . Rady waits for Walden to be out of earshot . &nbsp; RADYLeave it alone , will you ? It 's not our mission . She 's going to put us in a world of hurt with this gung-ho shit . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYou 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . Captain W 's okay . Takes care of her ship . &nbsp; ILARIOAnd her crew . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZAnd her crew . Our job is to help people , remember . &nbsp; RADYThey call and say Fowler needs a Medevac , I 'm there . It 's not our mission to wander around No Man 's Land looking for trouble . Raise .  --  128  --  &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou got trouble right here . Raise you , five . &nbsp; ILARIOIf it was you out there , you 'd want every aircraft in the hemisphere out looking . Pass . Walden comes back . &nbsp; WALDENWe 're on . Let 's get in the air . Altameyer , Major Teegarden wants to see you . Altameyer looks worried . Rady tosses down his cards , with a lot more force than needed . FADE OUT - FADE IN Walden 's Huey takes off . Teegarden watches until the dust obliterates his view . FADE OUT - FADE IN The sand swirls around the parked Huey . Inside the helicopter the crew wait it out . &nbsp; RADYI say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take much more of this sandblasting . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZMaybe this is n't one of your precious Blackhawks , but she 'll do the job . When the last Blackhawk is towed to the junkyard , the crew will fly home in a Huey . &nbsp; WALDENWe 'll wait for it to blow over , then try a few more clicks up the river . &nbsp; RADYBut all this sand in the intakes . . . &nbsp; WALDENMonfriez ?  --  129  --  &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZShe 's fine , Captain . It ai n't healthy , but it ai n't going to kill her . &nbsp; RADYWhat about the rotor blades ? &nbsp; WALDENRady , shut up . &nbsp; RADYYou do n't have to prove you 've got more balls than a man to make Major . &nbsp; WALDENRady , goddamnit . &nbsp; RADYI 'm asking for a transfer out soon as we get back . &nbsp; WALDENWhat , Christmas comes early this year ? Looks like it 's clearing . Let 's get . I 've got sand in places I did n't know I had places . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . &nbsp; RADYWhat 's that ? The main rotor sounds funny . &nbsp; WALDENNow you 're the Crew Chief , Rady ? The Crew Chief says we 're air worthy . The Crew Chief is the final word on that . Now I told you to shut up . If you do n't keep your conversation limited to the requirements of keeping this craft in the air I will haul your ass up for a Court Martial and you wo n't need a transfer .  --  130  --  Ilario and Monfriez share a conspirational smile . Chalk one up for the Captain . FADE OUT - FADE IN The Huey flies along the river . Altameyer is watching out one door , Monfriez the other , both searching the river banks . Ilario searches over Altameyer 's shoulder , talking to him . &nbsp; ILARIOBoth Captain Walden and I flew with Fowler at Hood . Captain " W " was the co-pilot , I was the Medic . When Captain " W " got her bird she took me with her . &nbsp; WALDENIlario 's the only one who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FADE OUT - FADE IN The Huey comes around the bend and upon the crashed Blackhawk . Men can be seen in the rubble firing weapons . &nbsp; ILARIOYou see Fowler ? ! What are they shooting at ? ! BOOM ! The enemy tank fires ! Ilario 's question is answered . The tail of the Blackhawk is blown off ! &nbsp; WALDENAltameyer , there 's your target ! She banks the chopper . Altameyer fires . The bullets do little damage . Altameyer , adrenalin pumping , keeps firing after they pass the tank . &nbsp; WALDENCease fire ! Cease fire ! I 'll try another run . &nbsp; RADYWe should go for altitude ! Call Air Rescue ! Get the fuck outta here ! Walden banks the Huey , gets ready for another run .  --  131  --  &nbsp; WALDENWe 'll make another try . Rady try to get on the horn to the AWACs , give ' em our coordinates ! Here you go , Altameyer . They pass again . Altameyer fires . Ilario is scared . Holes are appearing in the Huey . He stares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rady is staring out his window . &nbsp; RADYThat did n't do shit . You might as will piss on a rock . &nbsp; WALDENRady , get on the phone ! Monfriez , status ? ! &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZStable . Nothing prime . Rady 's right , Cap , we 'd need a jet with a two-ton bomb to take out that tank . &nbsp; WALDENWe 're not a jet , but we 've got a couple of bombs . Monfriez , unstrap the spare fuel pods ! Altameyer , get the flare gun . &nbsp; RADYWhat ? What do you think are , Walden , a jet jockey ? Go get a fucking Cobra ! This is not our mission ! BOOM ! The tank fires again ! &nbsp; WALDENRady , just get on the phone to the AWACS . We do n't stop that tank , there wo n't be anything left to rescue ! Let me know , Monfriez . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZReady , Cap ! Not quite , he 's still fumbling with the straps . Altameyer is scrambling to load the flare gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  132  --  FADE OUT - FADE IN &nbsp; WALDENOne more time , gentlemen . I know you can do it . &nbsp; RADYWe need that fuel to get back ! &nbsp; WALDENWe 've got more than enough to return , Rady . Get on the radio . Call in our position . That 's an order . Here we go . She banks over the tank . Monfriez drops the fuel pod . It hits . Altameyer fires the flare gun ! The tank bursts into flame . Ground fire rakes the Huey . The chopper goes out of control . It whirls ! Rady screams ! There 's blood on his window . Ilario hugs the wall . Walden tries to get control . &nbsp; WALDENMayday ! Mayday ! Dust off Three is . . . FADE OUT - FADE IN Ilario bends over Rady , who has been hauled into the back of the chopper . He presses a flap of scalp back over the shiny skull , wipes the blood from Rady 's face . Ilario is calm  --  this is what he knows how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio , clicking through the channels . Altameyer blazes away with the 240 out one door . Next to him , Monfriez does the same with the M-16 . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWe got ta get out of here . There 's hundreds of them ! We ca n't fight this ! &nbsp; ILARIOOne lung , through and through . Filling with blood , fast . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERCall for help ! Call for help ! &nbsp; WALDENRadio 's dead .  --  133  --  &nbsp; ALTAMEYERThe Blackhawk ! They have more men ! More firepower ! We 'll be safe there . &nbsp; ILARIOBad scalp wound . Into the brain . Concussion at least . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYeah , the Blackhawk ! We 'll be safe there ! Let 's go . &nbsp; WALDENIlario , can we move him ? &nbsp; ILARIOI would n't . He 's barely maintaining as it is . &nbsp; WALDENMonfriez , go to the other door ! We 're taking fire there . He obeys . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI 'll lay covering fire ! Get to those rocks ! Then you do the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWhat ? ! &nbsp; WALDENHe would n't make it . Altameyer , conserve ammo . We might be here a while . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWe got ta get out of here ! &nbsp; WALDENWe 're not going anywhere . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERWe ca n't fight . We do n't have . . . &nbsp; WALDENTAKE YOUR POSITIONS ! ! They do .  --  134  --  FADE OUT - FADE IN Ilario stares out at the night , scared , every noise makes him jump . Altameyer is at one door , Monfriez the other . Walden , Beretta out , sits next to a bandaged Rady . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYou know at dawn we 're dead . They 'll have reinforcements . We have to get to the Blackhawk before first light . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERIt 's so dark you ca n't see your hand in front of your face . Now 's the time to do it . Slip right by them . &nbsp; WALDENI told you , Rady ca n't be moved . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZRady 's dead . He 'll never make it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even like him . All he did was give you grief . Now you 're going to die for the prick ? I say we go . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZSo do I. Ilario ? &nbsp; ILARIOI just want to get out of here . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZIt 's a majority . &nbsp; WALDENThat would be great if this was a democracy  --  but it is n't . We stay with Rady . I do n't like him , but he 's one of mine . I would n't leave one of you behind . I wo n't leave him . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERMaybe if we surrendered the rag heads would doctor him up .  --  135  --  Walden looks at him , hard . &nbsp; WALDENNo surrender . FADE OUT - FADE IN Ilario checks Rady 's IV . Ilario 's hands are trembling . He glances out into the night . Walden takes one of his hands in hers , smiles . He calms down a bit . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERI hear something out there , I tell you . I ca n't see it , but I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONFRIEZOf course they are . What would you do ? I say we make for the Blackhawk now . &nbsp; WALDENAnd I say we 've heard enough of that shit . Now . Can it . Monfriez looks at her , fingers the M-16 . &nbsp; ILARIOMaybe we should surrender . It 's a mumble . The others ignore him . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZYou do n't have to go with us , Captain . We do n't even need your permission . That gets Altameyer and Ilario 's attention . &nbsp; WALDENGive me the M-16 , Monfriez . He looks at her . She raises the Beretta from her lap . &nbsp; WALDENYou can run , but I 'm not letting you take our firepower with you . She takes the M-16 from Monfriez . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERAre you going to take my gun away , too ?  --  136  --  She looks at him . &nbsp; WALDENIf I have to . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou just might . &nbsp; ILARIO ( softly ) They might treat us okay . I can make a white flag . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZGive it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beretta aimed at her . That jerks Ilario back to reality . &nbsp; ILARIOGuys . . . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZShe 's trying to get us killed . It 's us or her . Who you with , Ilario ? &nbsp; ILARIOCap . . . Rady 's finished . &nbsp; WALDENThat your expert opinion , Ilario ? He 'll never recover . If he was out in a field somewhere and we came to Medevac Rady , you 'd body bag him ? You 'd leave him behind ? &nbsp; ILARIOYes . It is word filled with shame , a blatant lie . &nbsp; WALDENAt least he 's ashamed to say it . She looks at Altameyer , who glares back . Then Ilario , who ca n't meet her eyes . Then back at Monfriez and the gun aimed at her . Quickly she raises her pistol and fires ! Monfriez fires back . Walden takes the bullet in her stomach . But her shot at Monfriez went past his shoulder . A ragged Iraqi falls on top of Monfriez , a bullet in his face .  --  137  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire into the dark . Muzzle flashes reveal the dozen enemy who have crept up on both sides of the Huey . Ilario crouches in a fetal position next to Rady , whimpering in fear . Walden uses the M-16 and Beretta . Then it is over . Quiet . They all stare into the night . Nothing . Then they look back at each other . Walden bleeds from the stomach . She is in pain as she jerkily grabs a magazine from the floor and reloads the M-16 , then her Beretta . Monfriez is reloading his Beretta . &nbsp; SERGEANT DEL MONFRIEZWe got ta out of here . They 'll try again . Give me the 16 , Cap . She looks at him . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou 're wounded , ma'am . Give him the 16 . We got ta go . We 'll carry you . She aims the M-16 at Altameyer . &nbsp; WALDENGive me the 240 . &nbsp; ALTAMEYERYou wo n't shoot . &nbsp; WALDENThe mood I 'm in right now , Altameyer , I 'd empty a magazine into your hide , reload and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the M-16 pointed at him , then her again . He hands over the 240 . &nbsp; WALDENPistols , too . They hand over their pistols . Ilario , roused from his paralysis , moves to her with a bandage . She points the Beretta at him .
