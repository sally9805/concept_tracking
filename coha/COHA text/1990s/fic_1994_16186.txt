FADE IN : EXT . CENTRAL PARK  --  A SUMMER DAY Across the vibrant green , WHITE TEENAGERS throw saucers and footballs , smoke cigarettes and joints , drink beer and soda . These are brash children of privilege , the anointed heirs of Manhattan Island , savoring the last hours of summer . MUSIC UP : ANGLE - LONNY BAUM 30 , moving along a walkway at the perimeter of the meadow . His walk is loping and weary . He wears jeans , sneakers , a ragged T-shirt , and a denim jacket adorned with patches of various left-wing political action groups . Unshaven and half-asleep , Lonny is an incongruous figure . A spectre among the living . Squinting into the hot sun , he idly watches the teenagers . TITLES IN Finally , Lonny casts his eyes to the ground and keeps walking . A few moments later , he casually glances up and his eyes fix on something . He slows to a stop . He watches , motionless , utterly absorbed . LONNY 'S POV : ACROSS THE MEADOW A BLACK GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wool blanket , intently reading a thick paperback book while listening to music through headphones . Petite and extraordinarily pretty , she wears a denim skirt and a white V-neck T-shirt . Around her neck hangs a tiny golden crucifix . One of her slim legs is bent at the knee and raised . She idly rotates a bare foot , from which a sandal has fallen . Her hair is straightened and cut in an Asian-style bob , with bangs pulled down in front . She turns the page and keeps reading , her concentration intense . BACK TO LONNY as he smiles vaguely . He looks across the meadow , unfavorably comparing the cocky , boisterous kids to this studious young girl . Suddenly , A HANDSOME YOUNG WHITE BOY loses control of a throw . His football spirals lamely over his FRIEND 'S head and tumbles directly toward the girl .  --  3  --  Lonny winces , wanting to call out and warn her , but it 's too late . The ball lands a few feet from her , bounces up , and slaps her dully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , then casts a cold eye at the boy as he runs up to retrieve it . She reaches over and snatches the ball . The boy , winded and red-cheeked , stops a few feet away and flashes her a brilliant smile . He says something apologetic but also a little flirtatious , then reaches out his hand for the ball . The girl smiles , too , and pumps her arm . The boy reflexively flinches , trying to catch the ball . But she has n't thrown it . She pumps her arm again , and again he flinches . She 's toying with him . His face is angry now ; he impatiently demands the ball . She smiles a warm surrender and extends her arm . He reaches down , but , at the last instant , her face hardens and she tosses the ball away . It lands ten feet away . The boy glowers , mutters to himself , and strides after it . The girl snickers dismissively . She falls back on her stomach and continues her studying . BACK TO LONNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Still smiling , he drops his head and walks on . Ten yards away , he turns back for one last glance at her . TITLES OUT . MUSIC OUT . CLOSE ON LONNY BAUM 'S FACE Under fluorescent lights , he looks down , reading aloud . His sad , expressive eyes are ringed with black . His unshaven face is pale and dry , his mouth tense . &nbsp; LONNYThirteen. . . point . . . miscellaneous . . . one up scored point .

Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gleaming skyscrapers which rise defiantly into the grey night sky . Above Lonny 's head , a digital clock reads : 3:14 am .

Fred stares at him sullenly for moment , then speaks in a glum monotone : &nbsp; FREDWhat 's the matter ? &nbsp; LONNY ( miserably ) The graveyard shift . I ca n't take it anymore , Fred . I feel like I 'm dying . Fred stares at him for a moment , then lays down his pencil . &nbsp; FREDYour thymus . &nbsp; LONNY ( looking up slowly ) What ? &nbsp; FREDWhen a person 's deprived of sunlight for too long , the thymus reverts to its earliest functions . It releases a hormone into the bloodstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pause ) You mean . . . like a bear ? &nbsp; FREDEssentially . Your organs fall asleep .  --  5  --  &nbsp; LONNYSo what do I do ? Silence . &nbsp; FREDBuy a sun lamp . stares at Fred for a long time . EXT . THE OFFICE BUILDING  --  MORNING Lonny is spit from a revolving door into the heart of Midtown Manhattan . He squints up at the hazy morning sun as DOZENS OF WORKERS , alert , neatly dressed , pour in around him . Disoriented , Lonny moves numbly to the curb , looks into the street , and raises his hand . Then he sees something that discourages him . LONNY 'S POV : FIFTEEN FEET AWAY A BLACK BUSINESSMAN in an Italian designer suit stands at the curb , his arm also uplifted . A TAXI heads straight for him , but as he steps off the curb the taxi speeds right past him and slows down as it approaches us . LONNY shocked and troubled , as the taxi stops right in front of him . He opens the door , hesitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman walks up to the taxi . Lonny sweeps a hand to the open door . &nbsp; LONNYPlease . &nbsp; BUSINESSMANHey , nice gesture . ( beat ) You take it . Lonny is flustered . The businessman looks at the anxious DRIVER through the open cab window , his gaze steady and direct . &nbsp; BUSINESSMAN ( cont . ) Shame . I 'm a big tipper . Asshole . He walks away , raising his arm to the next taxi .  --  6  --  DARKNESS We hear the ring of an alarm clock . Then a moan and the alarm is shut off . Then a lamp is switched on , casting a tiny pool of light into which Lonny 's exhausted face appears as he reaches for the string of a wooden blind . When he lifts it , the room explodes with sunlight . Lonny falls back on the bed , covering his face as though blocking a blow . His bedroom is tiny  --  nothing but a double bed wedged between high bookshelves . Outside a fierce sun burns in a bright blue sky . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lonny looks up and follows its flight , longingly , like a man behind bars . INT . A RESTAURANT  --  LATE AFTERNOON Lonny stirs a mug of tea . Across from him sits TODD FOSTER , early 30 's , black , attractive , wearing round gold-rimmed glasses and expensive , casual clothes . He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass of white wine . &nbsp; TODDDo you want me to tell you ? Do you , Lon ? Straight out ? Because if you do , I will . &nbsp; LONNYTell me . &nbsp; TODDI 'm always right . You know that . &nbsp; LONNYGive it to me . &nbsp; TODDDump Daphne . Lonny 's face twists with disbelief . &nbsp; TODD ( cont . ) No , no . Forget the messenger . Listen to the message . Dump her . &nbsp; LONNY ( humoring him ) Why ? &nbsp; TODDBecause you 're just like I was in the Peace Corps . See I loved  --  7  --  the idea of what I was doing over there , but check out the reality . Two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or smokes . I was noble all right , but I was dying . So give yourself a break . Forget your ideals . Cut your losses . Then go out and get laid . You 'll be wide awake . Lonny leans forward and speaks calmly , with a hint of smugness : &nbsp; LONNYTodd , I know the concept of a true partnership with a woman is impossible for you to fathom , so you 'll just have to trust me on this . My relationship with Daphne is the only thing in my life that does n't need fixing . CUT TO : A POSTER OF A FRIDA KAHLO SELF-PORTRAIT dimly visible on a dark wall . We hear the subtle TICKING OF A CLOCK , then a soft voice rises through the gloom . &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICE.I had another fight with my dad tonight . &nbsp; LONNY 'S VOICEAbout what ? &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICEThe usual .

Not since I threatened to disown him . I 'm still working on spic , but he seems pretty attached to it . Lonny nods and keeps reading . Daphne , musing meaningfully , begins to idly stroke her stomach . She heaves a bolstering breath , then tells him : &nbsp; DAPHNE ( cont . ) Lonny . I got accepted for Guatemala . &nbsp; LONNY ( distracted ) Huh ? &nbsp; DAPHNEMy application was accepted . I 'm going to go down and work for that human rights group in Guatemala . &nbsp; LONNY ( shocked ) What ?

Just sit around while you 're having adventures ? &nbsp; DAPHNEI do n't know . You could work on your book . Lonny 's anger is stopped dead . &nbsp; LONNYWell. . . what if I came with you ?

Lonny throws her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens her magazine . CUT TO : CLOSE ON MRS . BAUM 'S FACE as she places a fork full of food in her mouth and chews . Her short blonde hair is greying . Her features are sharp and handsome , her eyes blue and intelligent . After she swallows , she glances away :  --  10  --  &nbsp; MRS . BAUMHow 's the novel coming ? WIDE ON THE BAUM DINNER TABLE around which sit Mrs. Baum , Lonny , MR . BAUM , 60 , stern-faced , dark-skinned , and balding , and RUTHIE , Lonny 's sister , 18 , dressed stylishly , very pretty , but with a hint of brattiness around her painted mouth . Their small dining room is crowded with overburdened bookshelves . The air is dusty and the furniture antique . &nbsp; LONNYFine . &nbsp; RUTHIEYou always say that . Lonny glances coldly at his sister , then speaks with forced politeness . &nbsp; LONNYIt 's always true . &nbsp; RUTHIERight . &nbsp; LONNYYou 're an idiot . &nbsp; RUTHIEYou 're constipated . &nbsp; MRS . BAUM ( to Ruthie ) Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonder he writes at all , with the hours he works . Mr. Baum clears his throat and sets down his fork .

BAUMEvery thief and murderer in the Fortune 500 is a client of those lawyers you work for , right ? Every time there 's a class action suit against some polluting , thieving , no-good outfit , your boys jump in with a pile of paper .

Have I joined the enemy , too ? &nbsp; MR . BAUM ( exiting ) In your crib you joined them . Ruthie laughs . Lonny would like to throw his plate against the wall . Mrs. Baum shakes her head with sad resignation , then reaches over and lays her hand on top of Lonny 's . EXT . AVENUE C  --  NIGHT Lonny walks out of the high-rise middle-class housing project where his family lives . He walks a few steps then stops on the sidewalk . The traffic on the avenue roars by . LOITERERS are bunched around stoops under the cast of street lights . PEDESTRIANS pass through shadows . Lonny draws a deep breath and looks up at the lifeless night sky . Then he looks away and , just as he is about to walk on , he catches his OWN REFLECTION in the dirty lobby window . He moves closer and stares at it . THE CAMERA MOVES IN on the reflection .

Daphne sits with her friend , JAN , 23 , blonde , beautiful , steel-eyed , no make-up . They sit behind a card table set up at the side of the imposing marble steps . A sign hanging from the front reads : Register to Vote ! A YOUNG WHITE MALE JOGGER , wearing matching work-out clothes , exuding a supercilious air , sits down across from the young women . &nbsp; DAPHNEHi . You 're a resident of New York State ? &nbsp; JOGGERYou bet . Daphne slides a piece of paper on a clipboard in front of him . &nbsp; DAPHNE ( handing him a pen ) U.S. citizen ? &nbsp; JOGGERWhat , are you kidding ? My people built this country . He begins to fill out the form . &nbsp; DAPHNEThey were Native Americans ? &nbsp; JOGGER ( with a smirk ) Protestants . &nbsp; LONNY 'S VOICENative American killers . The jogger looks up and chuckles . Daphne turns around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks yellowish and dreary against the vibrant sky . He holds a white paper bag . Daphne 's smile is a trifle uneasy . &nbsp; DAPHNE ( taking his hand ) What are you doing here ? He leans down and kisses her quickly .  --  14  --  &nbsp; LONNYA picnic . I got all your favorites . Tofu sandwiches . Some carrot juice . If things got romantic , I figured I 'd drink it out of your shoe . Jan and Daphne exchange looks . Then Daphne turns back to Lonny . &nbsp; DAPHNEJan and I sorta made plans . You know , with the other volunteers . &nbsp; LONNYOh . &nbsp; DAPHNE ( re : the carrot juice ) Anyway , I 'm wearing sandals . &nbsp; JAN ( to Lonny ) You 're up awful early . &nbsp; LONNYIt 's part of my new resolve to keep from turning into a vampire . &nbsp; JANA lofty goal . &nbsp; LONNYYeah . Well , see you , Jan . Lonny leans over and kisses Daphne . He lingers for a moment , his mouth on her neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daphne smiles , but squirms uncomfortably . Lonny turns and walks away . &nbsp; JANBye . His registration card completed , the jogger turns the clipboard around and slides it to Jan . &nbsp; JOGGERThere you go .  --  15  --  &nbsp; JAN ( studying it ) Oops , forgot to sign it . ( sliding it back and pointing to the spot ) If you ca n't spell your name , just put a swastika . EXT . CENTRAL PARK  --  DAY Lonny walks over a carpet of fallen leaves . He sees a PREGNANT HOMELESS HISPANIC WOMAN , sleeping on her back on a bench , her hands crossed over her chest . The woman 's calves and feet are filthy , cracked , and bloody . Lonny stops , considers for a moment , then lays his bag of food between the woman 's hands . She does n't stir . Lonny walks on . LONNY on the walkway at the perimeter of the meadow . Again , it is alive with young people having fun . Lonny looks to his left and scans the green . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the black teenage girl . TWO YOUNG WHITE FASHION MODELS sit there in bathing suits . One covers her arm with oil , chatting animatedly to her friend who flips through a fashion magazine . THE WALKWAY , MINUTES LATER Lonny has nearly reached the end of the meadow . He walks with his head down , sombre , deep in thought . When he reaches a fork in the walkway and is about to branch off , he casually glances back . He does a double take . He stops dead and gazes into the distance , squinting into the sun . LONNY 'S POV : ACROSS THE MEADOW the same black teenage girl lies on the same red wool blanket , reading the same book , listening to music through headphones . BACK TO LONNY as his brow furrows with curiosity and he smiles . He retraces his steps and heads onto the grass . He stops . His face shows interest , but also puzzlement , as though he wants to walk away , but ca n't bring himself to and is n't sure why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  We pass from her slender thighs to the plump curve of her rear to the swell of her breasts to the smooth line of her neck to the chipped red of her fingernails and , finally , to her profile which reveals deep concentration in the book . ANOTHER ANGLE as Lonny casts his eyes to the ground , his better judgment and shyness taking hold . Just then the girl glances up , sees him , and yanks off her headphones . She glares angrily at him . Lonny steps away , embarrassed . He chuckles nervously . &nbsp; LONNYSorry . He backs up and slides a few inches . He looks back at his sneaker . Dog shit 's caked into the tread . He swears to himself , then begins to scrape his heel repeatedly in the grass . The girl watches , slightly disgusted , then , as Lonny scrapes his heel faster and faster into the grass , she breaks into a smile . Finally , she ca n't help but laugh . Lonny stops and looks at her . His anger at himself recedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Happens every day . &nbsp; DENISE ( flatly ) Shit 's all over . &nbsp; LONNYGuess I ought a learn to mind my own business . Her expression conveys her wholehearted agreement . Lonny , missing it , advances a few steps . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) See , everybody was having so much fun , and then I saw you and you seemed so involved in your book that I wondered what you were reading . ( re : her book ) You mind ? She 's guarded and annoyed , wants to be left alone . But seeing that he 's not going anywhere , she begrudgingly lifts the cover . It 's a PREPARATION BOOK FOR THE SAT .  --  17  --  &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Oh , yeah . I 've seen these . You taking the test soon ? &nbsp; DENISEUh-huh . &nbsp; LONNYFirst time ? &nbsp; DENISENo , . Took it last year .

( beat ) This time I 'm gon na ace it . She goes back to her book . &nbsp; LONNYI bet you will . She looks up at him and for the first time there is a hint of curiosity in her glance . Lonny kneels and reaches for the book . She looks at him with confusion and caution  --  what does he want from her ? Lonny gently takes the book from her and begins to flip through it . She watches his face as he intently studies the pages . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) The test is culturally biased , you know . It 's almost impossible for people of color to do well . Lonny stops on one page . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) " Dissemble . " Know what it means ? &nbsp; DENISETo hide . Disguise . Lonny , surprised and impressed , laughs affectionately .  --  18  --  &nbsp; LONNYOh . So it 's like that ? &nbsp; DENISE ( with a cool smile ) Uh-huh . Lonny scans down the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; LONNYIt means " before the flood . " ( explaining ) Referring to the flood in the Bible . If something came before that , it 's really , really old . &nbsp; DENISEHow do you say it ? &nbsp; LONNYAntediluvian . &nbsp; DENISEAnte-dil-uvian . &nbsp; LONNYPerfect . She smiles with satisfaction . Encouraged , he speaks heedlessly : &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Would you . . . would you mind if I sat with you a little while ? He plops down a few feet away from her and crosses his legs . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) See , I work nights . So I just woke up and if I do n't talk to someone , I 'm gon na go back home and fall asleep . And I really do n't want to do that . &nbsp; DENISE ( uneasily ) I ai n't gon na be stayin ' too long .  --  19  --  &nbsp; LONNYThat 's okay . He wiggles forward . She sits up and points , grimacing at his sneaker . &nbsp; DENISEYou better keep away with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches . She eases away and pats at her skirt , removing some grass . &nbsp; LONNYI 'm Lonny Baum . ( pause ) Who are you ? She 's surprised by his forwardness . He sees it and smiles . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Come on , what 's the big deal ? I 'm harmless . She thinks for a moment longer , then answers : &nbsp; DENISEDenise . &nbsp; LONNYPleasure to meet you , Denise . He extends his hand . She reluctantly reaches out and quickly shakes it . Lonny grasps her hand and wo n't let her remove it . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Not so fast . You 're supposed to squeeze back . ( beat ) So many girls never get taught how to shake hands . It 's a father 's job to teach you . ( beat ) Come on . Squeeze . ( She squeezes . ) Not so hard ! ( She squeezes again . ) There . Firm . Now that 's how you make an impression . She takes her hand back and smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? &nbsp; LONNYLonny . Lonny smiles , flipping through her book . INT . LONNY 'S BEDROOM  --  NIGHT Lonny and Daphne lie fully clothed . A WHITE CAT lies asleep at the foot of the bed . Lonny reads from a brand-new SAT Preparation Book . Daphne reads a biography of Anne Sexton . She closes her book and sets it on the bedside table . Then she rolls over , lays her head on Lonny 's chest , and kisses him gently on the neck . &nbsp; LONNYI wo n't charge her a cent . I told her to talk it over with her parents . ( beat ) Who knows if they 'll take me up on it . They might have too much pride . ( beat ) I hope they do though . She 's a smart kid . I bet I could help her a lot . There 's a real strategy to these , you know . She kisses him again and slips a hand onto Lonny 's thigh .

She slips into her shoes . Lonny rises onto one elbow . She lances him with an angry glance . She crosses quickly to the door . Lonny is confused and a little shaken . In the distance , we hear the front door slam .  --  21  --  CUT TO : &nbsp; pp. 22-54 LONNY AT HIS DESK  --  NIGHT Sitting in a pool of light , he stares at a blank piece of paper in an old electric typewriter .

Above his desk framed photographs of Ho Chi Minh , Che Guevera , and Malcolm X glare down austerely from the exposed brick wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red numerals read : 11:45 pm .

He clears his throat .  --  22  --  &nbsp; FREDReady ? &nbsp; LONNYFred , do you think there 's such a thing as a purely selfless act ? &nbsp; FREDAmong human beings ? &nbsp; LONNYYeah . &nbsp; FREDNo . &nbsp; LONNYI do .

Then Todd , Lonny 's friend whom we met earlier , walks up and joins them . Also an attorney , he is dressed almost identically to his colleagues . He shoots Lonny a furtive glance and impatiently taps his watch . They 're clearly waiting for Lonny and Fred to finish the document . His eyes dimming , Lonny heaves a sigh , then straightens out his document , and picks up his pencil . DARKNESS A telephone rings . It rings again . And again . A lamp is switched on casting a tiny pool of light into which Lonny 's  --  23  --  sleepy face appears as he reaches for the phone on his bedside table . &nbsp; LONNYHello ? &nbsp; DENISE 'S VOICEYou awake ? &nbsp; LONNYNo .

LONNY 'S POV : DENISE dashing toward him down a walkway , a newspaper over her head , her books tucked under her shirt . BACK TO LONNY smiling happily , utterly charmed . EXT . A GREEK DINER  --  AFTERNOON Through the rainy , misty front window , we see Lonny and Denise , their hair and clothes wet , playfully at ease , sitting across from each other in a red booth . In between gluttonous bites of a cheeseburger , Lonny reads from a PURPLE SPIRAL NOTEBOOK . &nbsp; LONNYEphemeral . &nbsp; DENISEDying quick . &nbsp; LONNYPulchritude.  --  24  --  &nbsp; DENISELookin ' good ! &nbsp; LONNYTurpitude . &nbsp; DENISEBad behavior .

" Denise looks at him as though he were crazy . Lonny chuckles and looks down . He notices something on the notebook . We  --  25  --  see it , too . It 's the name " Donny , " written in Denise 's handwriting , surrounded by a heart . Lonny eyes it curiously , when a WAITRESS interrupts . &nbsp; WAITRESSThere you go . She sets a CHOCOLATE SUNDAE down in front of Lonny . Denise shakes her head in disbelief . Lonny eagerly picks the cherry off the top and pops it into his mouth . &nbsp; DENISEHow many stomachs you got ? &nbsp; LONNYI 'm a growing boy . EXT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Lonny and Denise stand at the top of the stairs of a subway stop . Lonny extends his hand . It 's clear that so much generous attention has had its effect on Denise . Her smile is warm ; her eyes full of light ; but she is also more restrained now , uncomfortable with these warm feelings . &nbsp; LONNYYou 're on your way , young lady . Next stop , the Ivy League . Lonny extends his hand and she takes it . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Careful now . I 'm fragile . &nbsp; DENISE ( shaking his hand ) You 're crazy . He steps back awkwardly . He turns around and so does she . But before she 's gone very far , he turns around , sees her about to descend the steps , and calls out : &nbsp; LONNYDenise ? She stops and turns timidly . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) You 'll call me ? She nods slowly .  --  26  --  INT . DAPHNE 'S BEDROOM  --  NIGHT Daphne , naked , sits up , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes are closed . She 's far away ; hoarding her pleasure . She rides faster and faster , grinding more vigorously . LONNY lying on his back , looks up at Daphne , completely detached , stoically calm , his eyes dim . Lonny lifts both hands to her breasts and holds them . Eyes still closed , she pushes his fingers together , pinching her nipples . When she removes her hands , Lonny continues to pinch , which draws from her deep , agonized moans . Finally , Daphne rears back and lets out a cry . Then she falls on top of him , breathing hoarsely , kissing his neck . Lonny stares up at the ceiling . INT . DAPHNE 'S BEDROOM  --  AN HOUR LATER Through the shadows , we see Lonny lying on his side , facing us , his eyes open . Daphne , lying behind him , turns onto her side and touches his shoulder . Her tone is compassionate : &nbsp; DAPHNEWhat 's the matter ? &nbsp; LONNY ( almost inaudibly ) I do n't know . ( beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something I have n't told you . It 's embarrassing .

Daphne thinks for several seconds . &nbsp; DAPHNEDo you know what you want to say ?  --  27  --  &nbsp; LONNY ( softly , slowly ) What a horrible country this is . That every page of our history is splattered with blood . That we 're the most despicable race on the face of the earth . &nbsp; DAPHNEOh . That 's all . &nbsp; LONNYThat 's why no one 's ever written the Great American Novel  --  because no one wants to tell the truth about what a sick country this is. ( bitterly ) My father thinks I 've joined the enemy . But I have n't . I 'm surrounded by them , but I 'm watching . If I can get down what I want to say , he 'll realize how wrong he 's been and --  ( catching himself ) God , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( shaking his head ) I do n't know how you put up with me . In the background , Daphne sits up resolutely and switches on the light by her bed . She turns to face Lonny . Lonny , curious , rolls toward her . She takes his hand . &nbsp; DAPHNELonny , I don't --  I mean , I have n't been --  Well . . . . ( beat ) I 've been sleeping with Jan . Lonny looks at her , aghast . &nbsp; DAPHNE ( cont . ) It started about a month ago . As sort of an experiment . I figured it would pass . It has n't . It is n't going to . Not soon .

He heaves a deep sustaining breath .  --  28  --  &nbsp; DAPHNE ( cont. ) ( slowly ) I guess I hoped you 'd notice . Sense it .

Now it 's your turn . Please . Go out and get happy . INT . LONNY 'S APARTMENT  --  NIGHT Lonny sits at his desk , typing quickly , with almost desperate determination . His hair is shorter now . He 's clean shaven . He looks more alert than we 've ever seen him . After a flurry of typing , he stops and stares at a piece of paper sticking up from the roller . It 's half-filled with text . The desk phone rings . Lonny answers it . &nbsp; LONNYHello ? Denise 's voice is soft , slightly sensual : &nbsp; DENISE 'S VOICEHi . Lonny 's eyes ignite . He eases forward in his chair and , hiding his excitement , matches her intimate tone . &nbsp; LONNYHow are you ? &nbsp; DENISE 'S VOICESleepy . &nbsp; LONNYWhere have you been ? I thought you were gone forever . &nbsp; DENISE 'S VOICEI 'm gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( slowly ) I 'll be there . Silence . &nbsp; DENISE 'S VOICESweet dreams . She hangs up . Lonny hangs up , too , and sits for a moment , daydreaming . Then he pulls the sheet out of the roller and looks at it . As he reads what he 's written , he smiles with satisfaction , but slowly , gradually , his smile sours . He crumples the page into a wad and tosses it ON THE FLOOR where it lands among a DOZEN OTHER CRUMPLED SHEETS . EXT . CENTRAL PARK  --  AFTERNOON Denise sits up cross-legged on the red blanket , her skirt riding high on her thighs . Lonny sits a few feet away . As he fervently speaks , rather than absorb his words , Denise studies his face . &nbsp; LONNYSee , the analogies 're easy because they 're about relationships . So make a sentence with both words that shows what the relationship is . She looks away from his face , down to the workbook . She thinks . Lonny , overeager , interrupts : &nbsp; LONNY ( cont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right ? ( she looks up and nods ) So what 's the answer ? Denise throws him a comical look that says of course she knows . &nbsp; DENISEE . &nbsp; LONNYRight . In football you score a touchdown . Okay , that was easy .  --  30  --  &nbsp; DENISENo , it was hard . I 'm just real smart . &nbsp; LONNY ( with a smile ) Now what happens if you get to a hard one , and you do n't know the words in the question ? &nbsp; DENISEYou cheat . Lonny laughs and so does Denise . His laughter delights her . As Lonny rambles ahead , it 's clear that she 's not even trying to follow him ; she ca n't take her eyes off his face . &nbsp; LONNYNo . Process of elimination . Look at the choices and cross out the pairs of words that have nothing to do with each other . Then guess . Lonny stops , suddenly feeling the steadiness of Denise 's gaze . An uncomfortable moment passes between them , then Lonny lurches ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umm . . . for instance . . . do you have a relationship with him ? Lonny points to a FAT MAN sitting nearby on a lawn chair , wolfing down a hotdog . He wipes mustard off his mouth , then takes a gulp of his soda . Denise grimaces . &nbsp; DENISENo . &nbsp; LONNYBut you 're both Americans . You both have two eyes . Two legs . Is n't that a relationship ? &nbsp; DENISENo . I got nice legs . &nbsp; LONNY ( with a laugh ) You sure do . And you 're right , things in common is n't a relationship . There has to be more . An interactive connection .  --  31  --  &nbsp; DENISE ( flirting slyly ) Like you and me ? &nbsp; LONNY ( flustered ) Uhh. . . . ( beat ) Yeah . Tutor and student . That 's our relationship . Suddenly , her expression turns serious . Disappointment flickers in her eyes . Lonny sees it . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) And . . . we 're friends , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and longing there .

CENTRAL PARK WEST  --  EARLY EVENING Thirty yards away , far in the distance , down a Central Park walkway , Lonny and Denise walk toward us through the descending shadows . They speak quietly , confidentially : &nbsp; LONNYHow old were you ? &nbsp; DENISEFive or six . But I do n't remember him too good . &nbsp; LONNY ( correcting her ) Well . &nbsp; DENISEWell. ( pause ) He liked to sing . &nbsp; LONNYIs that what he did professionally ? He was a singer ? &nbsp; DENISENo , he worked on the Amtrak . But he sang at church . And he was always singin ' ' round the house . Would n't give us a minute 's peace .  --  32  --  &nbsp; DENISE ( cont . ) I think I remember that , but maybe my mother just told me . I got the worst memory . They reach us and turn down the avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUBWAY STOP  --  EVENING Lonny and Denise stand in the shadows at the top of the steps in the midst of an awkward silence .

( softly ) Well , I do n't really have too much money . Lonny 's heart melts at her embarrassment . He impulsively touches her shoulder . &nbsp; LONNYMy treat . INT . AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT  --  NIGHT Denise studies the menu , her face twisted with confusion . Lonny watches , barely able to control his affectionate amusement . She looks up and catches him staring and he bursts out laughing . She blushes . &nbsp; LONNYI 'll translate . What do you like ? &nbsp; DENISEPretty much everything . &nbsp; LONNY ( scanning the menu ) That 's a pretty broad range . Let 's see . How about . . . clams ? You like  --  33  --  clams ?

She smiles contentedly and sets down her menu . INT . THE RESTAURANT  --  HALF-HOUR LATER Almost finished with her meal , Denise demurely wipes her mouth with the linen napkin , listening with a smile as Lonny grimly speaks : &nbsp; LONNYWe 're so out of touch with reality . We do n't even laugh . We 're joyless . We ca n't dance ! We ca n't even hear a beat ! &nbsp; DENISE ( amused ) Tell me something I do n't know . &nbsp; LONNYBut worse than that we 're arrogant . Cruel . Obsessed with power . Denise , fighting a laugh , covers her mouth with her napkin . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) It 's true ! Racism 's practically genetic with us ! And I do n't think we 'll ever be free of it unless we intermarry to the point where everyone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , child , preach it ! &nbsp; LONNYWe treat people of color like dirt .

MUSIC UP : A CASHIER 'S HAND reading prices , then ringing up , THREE PAPERBACK BOOKS , all of them written by black authors : Baldwin , Hurston , and Cleaver . EXT . THE BOOKSTORE  --  NIGHT Lonny and Denise leave the store . Denise fishes into her bag and looks at the covers of the paperbacks .

Denise offers hers and they shake . Denise squeezes with gentle firmness . Lonny smiles . &nbsp; LONNYWow . Firm shake . You 're learning . Denise flashes him a bright smile . Lonny impulsively moves forward and kisses her cheek . He pulls away and for a moment they stand with their faces uncomfortably close . Lonny steps away and points to the subway steps . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Be careful . Denise , breathless , heart pounding , nods . Lonny walks backward . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) I do n't have your number . &nbsp; DENISE ( smiling sweetly ) I got yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DENISE 'S FACE as she watches him , a chaos of emotion playing across her features . LONNY as he glances back at her , then turns a corner and is gone . BACK TO DENISE as she drops her eyes , turns , and descends the steps . LONNY takes a few steps , and slides slightly . He looks and sees he 's stepped in dog shit . He breaks out laughing . MUSIC UP : LONNY as he walks down the dark , tree-lined street .

Her SAT book is open in front of her under a hanging lamp . She idly pets Lonny 's cat who  --  39  --  stands next to her on the counter . The rest of the apartment is dark . &nbsp; DENISE ( to the cat ) Hey , Thelonious . How 's my baby ? How you doin ' ? Lonny 's hands enter the frame and pick up the cat . &nbsp; LONNY 'S VOICEHe 's not allowed up here and he knows it . ANOTHER ANGLE Lonny drops the cat to the floor and walks behind the counter to the refrigerator . &nbsp; LONNYYou want some tea ? &nbsp; DENISE ( hesitantly ) Okay . He chuckles and opens the refrigerator door . &nbsp; LONNYWould you rather have something else ? &nbsp; DENISENo . It 's just --  ( indicating the cat ) Are n't you gon na wash your hands ? Lonny looks at her and smiles . &nbsp; LONNYWhatever you say . She smiles and goes back to work .

Lonny walks around the counter and sits next to her . &nbsp; LONNYSo how 's it going ? &nbsp; DENISEFine . Cept for this sorry old white man who keeps botherin me . Wo n't give me a minute 's peace . Lonny smiles and tilts the workbook toward himself , so he can see her answers . &nbsp; LONNYNot bad . But , remember , the test is like a Unicef poster , so as soon as you see a reading passage about blacks or Asians or any other minority , you know the answer 's not going to offend anyone . ( marking the page ) See , D is the " feel good " answer . Not A. Forget the passage . Just pick the dullest , most uncontroversial , All-American answer . Denise nods and goes back to work , but self-consciously this time , with Lonny sitting so close by . Lonny , restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red plastic and its face is decorated with a bright , playful design . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Cute . Denise throws him a sweet , annoyed glance . She sees he 's not going to let her work . Lonny looks at his own watch . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Mine 's pretty banal . He puts his wrist next to hers so that she can compare . Denise sets down her pen and looks at the watches . She bravely moves a little closer so that their forearms touch . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Graduation gift from my dad . An awkward silence as they stare at the watches . Denise smiles mischievously :  --  41  --  &nbsp; DENISEWanna trade ? Lonny looks at her curiously . Denise flashes her most winning smile . &nbsp; DENISE ( cont . ) Not forever ! &nbsp; LONNY ( charmed ) Hmm . Lonny unstraps his watch . Denise eagerly unstraps hers . Hers is off first . She hands it to him . He straps it on and looks at it , then he glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cont . ) You 've got yourself a deal . Denise breaks into a grin . Lonny takes her wrist and straps his watch to it . Then , holding her hand , he turns her wrist so that she can admire the watch . He checks her reaction and sees that Denise is not looking at the watch . She 's staring at him , her lips parted , her eyes gentle and frightened . He does n't let go of her hand . He stares back , tense with fear , his eyes rounding vulnerably . With a sudden lurch , as though against his will , he moves forward and kisses her . Slowly , his mouth opens , then hers , and they kiss deeply . Finally , overwhelmed , Lonny pulls away . They stare at each other each blankly , breathing hard , neither knowing what to do or say . AN UPRIGHT PIANO  --  DAY Sunlight fights its way through grimy windows , drearily illuminating the chipped black-and-white keys . &nbsp; WOMAN 'S VOICEDid n't Todd tell you I played ? &nbsp; LONNY 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame . She is VIVECA , mid-to-late 20 's , voluptuous , hollow-eyed , as pale as a ghost . She wears a tattered , silky vintage dress . She sits herself demurely on the piano bench , then reaches for a wooden block laden with small chunks of cheddar . Her eyes widen blankly . &nbsp; VIVECACheese ?  --  42  --  LONNY sits awkwardly on a ratty , old , silken sofa . Above him a RED SILK PARASOL hangs upside down from the ceiling . He is daunted by the woman 's unearthly strangeness . &nbsp; LONNYNo thanks . ( beat ) You know , the whole mucus thing . &nbsp; VIVECA ( flatly ) I love show music . Keeping her eyes trained on him , she cracks her knuckles . &nbsp; LONNYIs that right ? &nbsp; VIVECAYes.

Lonny stares at her intently , wondering is she heard a word of what he just said . &nbsp; VIVECA ( cont . ) I often play Todd selections from Showboat . Sometimes Porgy and Bess .  --  43  --  Lonny nods . Viveca turns on the bench and lays her hands on the keys . Lonny checks the time . It 's Denise 's watch he 's wearing . Thinking of her , he smiles . Suddenly , Viveca gets an idea and turns quickly : &nbsp; VIVECA ( cont . ) Are you Jewish ? &nbsp; LONNY ( stunned ) Half . &nbsp; VIVECA ( smiling warmly ) Fiddler on the Roof then . She pounds out a resounding bass chord . EXT . AN AVENUE  --  LATE AFTERNOON Lonny , irate , walks quickly . Todd , confused , struggles to keep up .

Lonny stops on a dime and turns to him , wide-eyed with scornful disbelief . &nbsp; LONNYI do n't sleep with schizophrenics ! &nbsp; TODDWhy not ? ' Cause she 's twenty-seven ? That 's not her fault . Lonny groans walks quickly on . Todd hurries to keep up . &nbsp; TODD ( cont . ) Bed her , Lon . Please .

And that 's the last thing you need right now ! Lonny turns the corner . Todd rushes after him . &nbsp; TODD ( cont . ) That 's why I picked Viv ! There 's no future there ! I doubt she 'll live to be forty . &nbsp; LONNYYou sleep with her then ! &nbsp; TODDI did ! She 's insane ! It was incredible ! Lonny stops suddenly .

Todd 's face falls when he reads Lonny 's expression . &nbsp; TODD ( cont . ) Oh , no . &nbsp; LONNY ( walking away ) Talk to you tomorrow . &nbsp; TODD ( calling out ) Do n't do it , Lon ! DO N'T ! From the next scene , we hear A CRASH OF THUNDER .  --  45  --  INT . LONNY 'S BEDROOM  --  NIGHT Cloaked in deep shadow , set off against a rainy window pane , we see Lonny , his shirt off , moving on top of Denise whose blouse is open and bra unhitched . He is aggressive and passionate , breathing hoarsely , kissing her neck and breasts and mouth . She kisses him back with equal passion . But her torso is passive and there is something tentative and stiff in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illuminates the room and we see Lonny 's cat standing on a bureau . Seconds later , a CRASH OF THUNDER shakes the window . His passion mounting , Lonny tears himself away , rolling off Denise as though against his will . Lying on his back , his face sweaty and flushed , he gasps for breath . Denise just lies there , also breathing heavily , looking up at the ceiling . &nbsp; LONNY ( a whisper ) I do n't know . It 's just --  She rolls onto her side and lays her head on his chest . For a moment there is only the patter of rain on the window and the fire escape and the heavy rasp of Lonny 's breathing . Denise speaks softly , with a touch of hurt : &nbsp; DENISEYou do n't wan na do it ? &nbsp; LONNYAre you --  I mean --  ( beat ) Have you ever had sex before ? She closes her eyes . Her face tenses . She shakes her head no .

Relieved , he smiles and tenderly gathers her into his arms . &nbsp; LONNY ( cont . ) Let 's just lie here . EXT . THE REAR COURTYARD  --  NIGHT Rain pours straight down in darts . The fire escapes , oily black , glisten and drip . A laundry wire hanging between windows bears a load of dripping white shirts and sheets . INT . LONNY 'S BEDROOM Lonny and Denise lie naked , entwined , half-covered by a sheet . Denise lies on her back . Lonny , turned onto his side , runs the back of his hand along the contours of her face , slowly and adoringly , as though committing every detail to memory . Denise tugs the sheet a little higher , covering her breasts . &nbsp; LONNYCold ? Denise shakes her head no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then kisses her gently on the mouth . He slips his hand beneath the sheet and from the movement of his arm , we know that he is intimately caressing her . Denise closes her eyes and gulps a deep breath .

THE BAUMS ' APARTMENT  --  NIGHT Lonny , looking down , reads aloud : &nbsp; LONNY " It was fall but it might have been summer .

" My grandfather came to this country with two cents in his pocket ! He worked hard and he got ahead , so why ca n't the blacks ? " And it makes me sick . They have no appreciation of what four hundred years of physical and psychological degradation can do to a people . We rob you of your past , enslave you , rape your women --  &nbsp; DONNYMr .

Lonny stops . She moves to him and grabs him firmly by the elbow . She pushes him forcefully toward the door . INT . THE HOSPITAL HALLWAY Margaret leads him out and turns him toward the wall . She steps back and they stare at each other . Her eyes burn with anger ; his are contrite and shrinking .

He looks at it for a moment , then hands it to her . She takes it . Lonny turns and stops abruptly . Donny Stewart stands there . His bearing is proud , his face rigid with enmity . Lonny ca n't bear the tacit condemnation in his eyes . Lonny looks at the floor .

Lonny stops walking when A CAR HORN HONKS . He turns , and from nowhere , as though out of a dream , A RADIO CAB glides up . It 's a navy blue Lincoln with dark tinted windows .

He pushes her onto her back and she laughs as her head hits the pillow .  --  98  --  LONNY 'S FACE watching the tape . His mouth is ajar , his eyes mesmerized .
