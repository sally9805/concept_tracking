<p> Like fences , bridges make good neighbors . That 's especially true of the Walnut Street Bridge over the Tennessee River . <p> The 3/4-mile pedestrian span between the Market Street and Veterans bridges links the chic Bluff View Art District on the south bank and still developing but definitely cool Frazier Avenue on the North Shore . <p> Bluff View boasts elegant inns , tony restaurants , an upscale gallery and a riverside sculpture garden . Offbeat Frazier Avenue is a Virginia-Highland in the making , with a mishmash of storefront shops , galleries and come-as-you-are eateries , including a coffeehouse , a greasy spoon and a vegetarian diner . <p> Though quite different in character , these artsy enclaves are two of the hippest neighborhoods in this vibrant metropolis that has rejuvenated its once-derelict downtown and has more to offer visitors with each year . <p> On a recent sunny morning , the bridge was bustling with comings and goings : Teens zipping along on in-line skates . Moms pushing babies in strollers . Older couples out for a walk . Schoolchildren on field trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving across the span . <p> From the bridge , with its turquoise trusses and wood-planked walkways , you can see the distinctive triangles that form the roof line of the Tennessee Aquarium . Its prominence goes way beyond its commanding place on the skyline . Since opening in 1992 , it has sparked not only downtown 's redevelopment but the riverfront renaissance as well . <p> " It certainly was the reason for a lot of the wind under our wings , " says Mary Portera . Along with her husband , physician Charles Portera , she founded the Bluff View Art District and opened the River Gallery four months after the aquarium opened less than a half mile west . <p> Standing on the bridge and looking north , you can witness yet another sign of the city 's rebirth : the construction of two pavilions in Coolidge Park behind the rows of stores along Frazier Avenue . By summer , they will house an old-fashioned carousel with hand-carved horses and a food court . <p> All this revitalization has created not only a tempting tourist destination  --  Atlantans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours  --  but a more interesting place to live . <p> Just ask Charles McKinney and Ed Huckaby , whom we found making themselves very at home in well-worn easy chairs in Mudpie , a folk art-filled newstand/coffeehouse on Frazier Avenue . The two buds , both 37 , were smoking cigs , drinking cups of joe and basically escaping their wives and kids . <p> " The atmosphere is great , " McKinney says . " We come here to de-stress . They 've really done a lot to bring this area back . " Adds Huckaby : " You can walk on the bridge at 11 o'clock at night and feel safe . Kids from the college ( University of Tennessee-Chattanooga ) come to the bridge to play guitar and sing . It 's a lot of fun . " <p> Mudpie 's lived-in look and hodgepodge of furniture suits Frazier Avenue , which is well on its way from frumpy to funky . <p> When Angela Usrey opened her eponymous gallery of American folk art four years ago , she became one of the first to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Market Street . <p> Many businesses have followed , but , she says , " I still consider everybody over here a pioneer . . . . We 're still a work in progress . " <p> As you amble down the sidewalks  --  popping in and out of the delightfully eclectic stores such as River City Apparel Outlet , Barrett &; Co . Booksellers , In-Town Gallery and Cook Works  --  you 'll notice sets of brass footprints embedded in the pavement . Look again , and you 'll see they are dance patterns . Where else can you learn the mambo and waltz , the tango and the twist while you shop ? <p> Frazier Avenue 's more than 30 shops seem to offer a little bit of everything : Medusa for ethnic art . Cigars &; Gifts for smokes and more . Elements for mod furnishings and home decor . The Big Much for a fabulous assortment of toys . New Moon Gallery for New Age accouterments . Choo Choo Tackle for outdoor and fishing gear . One Earth for natural foods . Rosie Remembers for beautiful imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At Angela Usrey Gallery , you 'll find a colorful collection of outsider art by the likes of Jimmie Lee Sudduth , Howard Finster , R.A. Miller , Homer Green , Purvis Young and Bessie Harvey . <p> And then there 's Worm &; Weasel Werks , a former gas station where two sisters ( whose childhood nicknames gave the shop its fanciful name ) sell natural-fiber clothing and vintage-look jewelry . <p> On the shopping district 's outskirts , near the foot of the Walnut Street Bridge , is the Chattanooga Theatre Centre , which is presenting " Miracle on 34th Street " through Saturday . <p> Look south across the river , and you 'll see perched on the bluff the city 's fine Hunter Museum of American Art  --  both the original Hunter mansion and the modern addition . A bit farther along the bluff is the three-story Tudor mansion that is one of the three houses that make up the Bluff View Inn . <p> From Frazier Avenue , it 's a short stroll across the bridge and up the Riverwalk , a pedestrian byway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art District . <p> The gentrified arts area is tucked away on a cul de sac at the intersection of East Second and High streets , adjacent to the Hunter Museum and the Houston Museum of Decorative Arts . <p> The Porteras have played a canny game of urban Monopoly in developing the district , acquiring historic buildings as they came on the market and rehabbing the structures . The first was the Newell House , now home to the River Gallery , Chocolate Kitchen ( where sinfully rich hand-dipped candies are made and sold ) and Rembrant 's Coffee House . Renaissance Commons , which serves as a special events facility and management offices , opened in 1996 . <p> Since 1993 , the Porteras have purchased three historic homes scattered throughout the one-square-block district that are collectively known as the Bluff View Inn . The C.G. Martin House , a 1927 Colonial-style home , is also the site of the Back Cafe Inn . The 1908 Victorian-style T.C. Thompson house was the home of a former Chattanooga mayor . Its carriage house is now Tony 's Pasta Shop &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates to the late 1880s , became the third and largest bed-and-breakfast . <p> On a recent visit , we stayed at the Maclellan House in a cozy third-floor room , elegantly decorated in soothing tones of mauve and green and furnished with a queen-size sleigh bed , an antique secretary and sofa . Large windows provided a view of the river and Veterans Bridge . The tub had water jets to revive tired legs after a long day of sightseeing . <p> During the holidays , a Christmas tree decorated with vintage teddy bears and natural materials  --  including raffia , topiary and lichen ornaments , grapevines , dried pods , pepper berries , dried pomegrates , twig bundles and pine cones  --  stands in the grand home 's parlor . <p> Guests of all three inns are invited to breakfast in the Audubon Room at the Maclellan . After our omelettes and French toast , we wandered through the many rooms of the River Gallery , a fine art and craft gallery featuring its sixth annual Salon Show . The invitational exhibit showcases the works of 12 gallery artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serene Sculpture Garden on the riverbank , we absorbed the beauty of both art and nature as golden leaves fell from ginkgo trees . <p> More than 20 pieces are a part of the permanent collection and another 20 are in the 1998-1999 exhibit " Integration Art &; Nature . " If you happen to fall in love with a piece from the exhibition , you can take it home  --  for a price . The works range from $ 1,500 to $ 25,000 . <p> But sculpture is not confined to the garden . Exploring the district , you 'll see environmental works at every turn as well as wonderful architectural details such as the stained glass panel at Tony 's and a solid copper-clad door from the Ohio Governor 's Mansion at Renaissance Commons . <p> As evening fell , lights on the bridges began to twinkle . From the overlook next to the bocce ball court at the Maclellan House , we gazed across the river . <p> At a time when many downtowns would be rolling up their sidewalks , plenty of skaters and strollers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city smitten with renewal , no one seemed to be in a rush to get home . <p> Water adds a dynamic element to a sculpture in the Bluff View Art District , on the river 's south bank . / PHIL SKINNER / Staff Photo : The joe flows at laid-back Mudpie on Frazier Avenue , an offbeat artery lined with eateries , art galleries and eclectic shops . / PHIL SKINNER / Staff Photo : On a field trip with classmates , Holly Bunch , 14 , leapfrogs over posts on the Walnut Street Bridge .
