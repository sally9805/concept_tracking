<p> They came . They saw . They shopped for bargains . <p> The unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season drew traditionally large crowds at stores and shopping malls across the USA . Weak economy ? Bah , humbug . On this weekend after Thanksgiving , shoppers refused to stay home . <p> But when it came time to part with hard-earned dollars , caution still reigned . Many shopped without buying , describing their behavior as comparison shopping . Those who did buy voiced an unwavering desire for sales and incentives , a mood that might cut deeply into stores ' profits . Retailers who finished the weekend smiling were those who offered creative ways to save money . <p> At New York Men 's Fashion , a clothing shop in San Bernardino , Calif. , manager Jose Salazar gave away a coupon for a free turkey for each $ 100 purchase . Business , he reports , was fabulous . By Sunday , he had given away 25 turkeys . He has ordered 25 more . <p> " You give to people , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando , Fla. , the manager of a Gitano factory-outlet store says revenue is above what it was this time last year . And he knows why . " It 's the 25%-off storewide sale we are having , " says Victor Concordia . " This year , if people walk in and see nothing on sale , they are n't going to buy . " <p> Among the big retailers , reactions to the first holiday shopping spree were mixed . Dayton Hudson officials say they are pleased with revenue , which ran at about the same level as it did last year . <p> Sears executives were disappointed . " Concerns about the economy and warmer-than-normal weather across most of the country affected holiday sales this weekend - which were somewhat below our expectations , " says Matthew Howard , a senior vice president . He would n't say what the expectations were . " Consumers appear to be more in a shopping mood than in a buying mood . " <p> Many retailers report seeing the crowds but not the cash . David Akins , manager at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says his parking lot was jammed but revenue was off 55% to 60% from the same time last year . <p> Virginia Fricke , co-owner of Bonnie 's Catered Crowd , a gift and collectibles shop in Fort Myers , Fla. , reports a lot of browsing . " They do n't just run in and buy , " she says . <p> These browsers are n't just looking for the perfect gift idea - they are looking for sales . Shoppers interviewed around the USA say they know the stores are anxious for their business . And they intend to wait until the retailers make buying worth their while . <p> " I am strictly a sales shopper , " says Judy George , 48 , a schoolteacher taking a break from her shopping at Pentagon City Mall in Arlington , Va . " There 's lots of people out here today , but there is a shortage of money . " <p> Robert Gaskins , wife Melissa and their two sons also visited Pentagon City over the weekend , " but just window-shopping , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative spending , is waiting for the later part of the season and better sales . <p> Retailers responded to the desire for bargains in force . At the Macy 's department store at Pentagon City , red and white sale signs were as prevalent as Christmas decorations . Under the greenery and white lights , the signs read , " 20% off , 30% off , take $ 10 off our sale price . " <p> A Rochester , N.Y. , K mart drew a crowd with an early-bird electronics sale . Televisions and VCRs were discounted 50% to 70% . A line already had formed outside the store when it opened its doors at 7 a.m . Later in the afternoon , when the sale hours had passed , the crowd fell to normal weekend levels . <p> Such promotions had their desired effect : crowd creation . At a Target store in Sioux City , Iowa , an early-bird sale drew such a response , manager David Paddock decided to extend it the entire day . " I was really worried , but it 's just been tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot better than last year . The recession does n't seem to exist here . " <p> Promotions , which have typified holiday retailing for the past three years , are even more in demand this year as twin worries of the economy and war in the Persian Gulf have consumers holding tight to their wallets . <p> Since summer , the retail business has been sluggish at best . Big names like Sears and J.C . Penney report that revenue is down from the same period a year ago . Hot retailer The Limited last month saw a 1% drop in revenue from stores open at least a year . The Gap and Wal-Mart remain two of the few bright spots in retailing . <p> Consumer confidence has plunged to recession levels . A USA TODAY poll this month found that 74% of respondents will spend the same as or less than they did last year on holiday gifts . Their shopping theme : Hunt for bargains . <p> In some cases , retailers have teamed to battle the bleak outlook . In Marshalltown , Iowa , downtown stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged for a visit from Santa . They even handed out coupons good in one another 's stores . <p> By contrast , in New York , some of the USA 's biggest names in retailing fell into " hand-to-hand combat in mid-Manhattan , " says Alan Millstein , editor of Fashion Network Report . Department stores worked hard to outpromote each other and snag the shrunken holiday-gift budget . <p> " Major department stores like Macy 's turned Santa into Crazy Eddie , where they will meet or beat any price , " Millstein says . " It 's the best possible news for the consumer and worst possible nightmare for retail management . " <p> This year will be worse than last year in terms of promotions , he says , because none of the department stores seem to have learned from last year 's bloodletting . A rash of price promotions last year , led by struggling Federated Department Stores , forced department stores to cut their prices . That , in turn , sliced profits . <p> " If that 's going to be the climate again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-described as skim milk , " Millstein says . <p> That 's more dangerous for some than others . For Federated stores , it could stymie attempts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy . For Macy 's , another year of poor holiday earnings could push the debt-laden retailer into Chapter 11 . For almost everyone in the retailing business , this time of year means anywhere from 30% to 50% of the year 's revenue . <p> But not all take the Thanksgiving weekend as a harbinger of the season . Its reputation as the biggest shopping days of the season is overplayed , say some retailers . Now , the last 10 days before Christmas are the biggest moneymakers . Thanksgiving weekend is more of a look-see period . <p> " This is a heavy-traffic day we get a lot of people coming through the store , but it 's not a super buying day , " says Gary G. Limmer , manager of an Oh So Clever ! store in Tucson , Ariz . " I would say the busiest shopping day of the year would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and buying . " <p> Or so he and every other retailer hope . CUTLINE : SALE SCOUTS : Barbara Elwell and crew tally up their booty from Pentagon City Mall .
