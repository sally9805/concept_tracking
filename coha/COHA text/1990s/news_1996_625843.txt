<p> A rich aggregate of Texas roots and family connections makes the Alley Theater 's " The Young Man From Atlanta " " both a homecoming and a culmination in the long , distinguished career of Wharton-born playwright Horton Foote . <p> The family drama , winner of the 1995 Pulitzer Prize , makes its Houston debut Wednesday on the Alley 's Large Stage . <p> Set in Houston in the 1950s , the play depicts a middle-age couple , Will and Lily Dale Kidder , struggling to come to terms with the mysterious death of their adult son , who had moved to Atlanta . Bill drowned while swimming - which neither parent understands , since their son could not swim . Gradually , they come to suspect that Bill may have committed suicide . <p> Their situation is complicated when Will 's company fires him and replaces him with a younger man . In financial straits , Will must ask Lily Dale for her savings . He is angry to learn that she has given much of the money to the play 's title character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Atlanta was Bill 's roommate , and according to Lily Dale he is so distraught about Bill 's death that he has been unable to work . That and other family crises have led him to visit his dead roommate 's parents in Houston , seeking consolation and assistance . <p> Will has vowed he will not see the visitor again and forbids Lily Dale to see him . But the young man from Atlanta remains a hovering presence just beyond the play 's action - perhaps holding the answers to the mysteries surrounding Bill 's life and death . <p> " Young Man " began life with a reading at the Alley in 1992 . It was produced last year as part of the off-off-Broadway Signature Theater 's all-Horton Foote season . <p> ( Signature devotes each season to the work of one living playwright . ) <p> Foote 's season at Signature offered four plays , all New York premieres : " Talking Pictures " ( premiered at Houston 's Stages in 1988 ) , " Laura Dennis , Night Seasons and Young Man . " All were well-received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Vincent Canby , of the New York Times , called it " " a first-rate production of a work that will haunt you long after the performance . " Clive Barnes , of the New York Post , wrote that it was " " not to be missed . " <p> Following its limited engagement at the 75-seat Signature , " Young Man " was readied for a larger co-production by Boston 's Huntington Theater ( where it played last fall ) and the Alley . It is the Alley 's first Foote play since " The Traveling Lady " " in 1986 . <p> The Boston/Houston production retains the Signature 's creative team , headed by director Peter Masterson and starring Carlin Glynn and Ralph Waite . ( Waite 's Broadway credits include " Blues for Mr. Charlie and The Father , " " but he 's known to millions as Pa John Walton on TV 's Emmy-winning " The Waltons " ) . <p> The husband-and-wife team of Masterson and Glynn brings a cluster of longtime connections to Houston , the Alley and Foote 's work . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1958 . Masterson , a " " distant cousin " of Foote , has had many other opportunities to direct his work , including Stages ' premiere of " Talking Pictures " " and the film versions of " The Trip to Bountiful " ( which also featured Glynn ) , " Tomorrow and Convicts . " " Masterson recently completed filming Foote 's " Lily Dale " " in Dallas , with a cast headed by Stockard Channing , Sam Shepard and ( extending the connection another generation ) Mary Stuart Masterson , who is Masterson and Glynn 's daughter . <p> Masterson also directed Glynn in her Tony-winning performance in the original New York production of " The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas " ( one of the rare Texas-set works that Foote did not write ) . <p> Following his initial move to New York , Foote was first represented on Broadway in the early 1940s with the plays " Wharton Dance " and " Texas Town . " Since then , Foote has established himself as the " " Texas Chekhov " with an array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . <p> Most have been set in Texas , a few in other Southern locales . <p> They range from his 1950s Broadway productions " The Trip to Bountiful and The Traveling Lady " to scripts for " Playhouse 90 " during the heyday of live TV drama to his Oscar-winning screenplays " To Kill a Mockingbird " and Tender Mercies . <p> He devoted much of the 1970s and early ' 80s to writing " The Orphans ' Home , " an ambitious nine-play cycle based on his family 's history . Most of these plays were individually produced off-Broadway during the 1980s , and several have been filmed : " Courtship , On Valentine 's Day , 1918 " and " Lily Dale . " He also wrote the screenplay for Gary Sinise 's recent remake of John Steinbeck 's " Of Mice and Men . " <p> Foote spends half the year at his family home in Wharton and half at his apartment in Greenwich Village . His creation of " Young Man " began with the character of Lily Dale , seen in three plays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just came to me to write about Lily Dale and her husband , Will Kidder , in Houston in the ' 50s , " Foote said . <p> " " It 's about where they find themselves , economically and spiritually , at this stage of life . And how they meet the death of their only child . " <p> The play 's New York and Boston engagements have prompted much discussion of the unseen visitor . He has told Lily Dale many facts about Bill 's life , which she believes . But a great-nephew of Will 's insists the roommate 's stories are lies . Foote leaves it to each playgoer to decide who is telling the truth . <p> " " I do n't take sides , " he said . " " I just let it unfold . As far as I 'm concerned , one of the great strengths of the play is that there are diverse opinions as to the truth being told by certain characters . I 'm delighted that people take sides about it . For instance , whether Bill committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks Bill did kill himself - he somehow feels he has failed his son . The mother disagrees . " <p> Foote feels that " Young Man 's " Pulitzer is " " both for the particular play and also a cumulative thing , " acknowledging his entire career . <p> He can not pick a favorite work from among his many writings . <p> " " Your feelings are always strongest for whatever you 're working on at that particular moment . " <p> Pulitzer notwithstanding , Foote is still making little adjustments in " Young Man . " <p> " " I work on the play all the time , " he said . " " I 'm working on it <p> right now . There are things you question , and you 're constantly searching . I just worked with ( actor and playwright ) Sam Shepard in the film of " Lily Dale . " And he was saying how , for a recent production of his play " Buried Child , " which won the Pulitzer in 1979 , he made a number of changes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love rehearsals . We have a lovely , gifted company . " <p> Shepard will be the subject of Signature 's 1996-97 season . " " I encouraged him to do it , " said Foote . " " It 's terrifying in a <p> way , because if things did not go well , you could have a miserable year . But the people at Signature do such a fine job . I wish every playwright could have it ( a theater devoting a season to his or her work ) . " <p> Critics praise the unswerving integrity of Foote 's writing , finding it quiet , truthful and unaffected . But the playwright said he 's never had any choice in the matter . <p> " " To write in the other ( commercial ) way is a distinct talent . <p> I do n't have that talent . I could n't do it . " <p> Like everyone else in the theater , Foote is troubled by the dwindling options on Broadway , especially for plays . <p> " " It 's never going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make a living just writing for the Broadway theater , " he said . " " I walk in the theater district now and think of when I started out as an actor . You could go from office to office then , from producer to producer . Now there 's no place to go . And 18 of the Broadway theaters are currently empty . <p> " " The great enemy is the terrible cost , and there 's no way to change that . My first play on Broadway cost $ 18,000 to produce . Today , even a small play on Broadway costs $ 700,000 or $ 800,000 - and that 's with the Broadway Alliance , the special deal where everyone takes a cut in pay to make the production possible . <p> " " But there 's off-Broadway . And small companies like Signature come along . And across America there are companies like the Alley , resident theaters where a production has as much prestige as a Broadway run used to have . It 's exciting for me to be produced at the Alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston was always the big city . And when I used to come into town , I never thought I 'd see a production like this of one of my plays , in Houston . " <p> As a frequent director of Foote 's works , Masterson believes the comparison to the Russian Anton Chekhov is apt <p> " " He is more like Chekhov than like most of our U.S. playwrights , " said Masterson . " " ( Arthur ) Miller and ( Tennessee ) Williams are more presentational , dealing in huge emotions , with melodramatic fireworks . Horton deals in understatement . <p> He avoids emotionalism as well as sentimentality . " <p> Because of those qualities and the small scale and limited run " Young Man " had off-off-Broadway , Masterson was delighted when the play drew such favorable reviews . <p> Just as the crucial character who provides the catalyst for the drama remains offstage , Masterson said some key concerns of the drama remain unspoken . He feels that is in keeping with the time and place in which the action is set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's about a family coming to terms with the death of a son , also with the past history of that son , " Masterson said . <p> " " There 's the indication he may have been homosexual . But the father and mother just do n't want to discuss that . Toward the end of the play , the father almost says it - but then he ca n't . What he winds up saying is , ' I do n't want to know . ' " <p> While some couples might find it problematic to work together so frequently , Masterson said he and Glynn find it convenient and " " like being able to talk about our work at home . " Besides doing " Young Man " in New York last season , Masterson directed and Glynn acted in the off-Broadway production of R.T . Robinson 's " The Cover of Life . " <p> Masterson also found it a treat to direct daughter Mary Stuart Masterson in the film of " Lily Dale " - indeed , playing the young-adult version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " " I 'd worked with Mary before - because when she was 7 she had a part with me in the film " The Stepford Wives . " She was always interested in performing and good at it . But we discouraged the other offers when she was young , " he said . <p> " " Then , when she was 17 , she started up again , and she 's been working steadily since . I had a great time directing her in " Lily Dale . " We 're very proud of her . " <p> Masterson and Glynn also are producing a film based on Sherman Alexie 's book " The Lone Ranger &; Tonto Fistfight in Heaven , " which will use an American Indian cast and director . <p> Plans called for the Boston/Houston production of " Young Man " to go directly to Broadway late this spring , with its original cast and director . But in recent weeks producer David Richenthal , who has optioned the play for Broadway , has said he wants a different director for Broadway - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richenthal may be concerned about the commercial prospects of such a quiet piece in the current Broadway climate , where serious dramas rarely run for long . He may be planning to bolster its chances by adding a director and stars with more box-office clout . There 's no final decision on when the play will go to Broadway or who might be at the helm or in the cast . <p> For now , Masterson and Foote prefer to focus on the Alley run as an end in itself . <p> " " A Broadway production is put off until next season , " said Masterson . " " This production is still evolving . We 've just made some changes in the staging , because in Boston we had a proscenium theater and here we have a thrust stage . Now we have to see , when we get our first audiences , whether these things change how it plays for them . " <p> " " As a playwright , I 've seen many different versions of my work , " said Foote . " " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's one of the realities of the theater . <p> " " David Richenthal has an option on the play for Broadway , and he loves the play , and , of course , he has a lot of say about what the Broadway production will be . <p> " " But I love this production , and I 'm very active in the plans for the play 's future . I 'm hoping the Broadway producers will see it again here and will like it as much as I do . "  --  <p> The Young Man From Atlanta <p> When : Previews at 7:30 p.m. today and Tuesday .
