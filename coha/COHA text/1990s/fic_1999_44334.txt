How do you learn exactly how lucky you are ? <p> THE PILE OF CLOTHing was as tall as the upright piano at which Kathy Zuba was sitting and banging away at her practicing . She was supposed to be helping out . But instead she would spend the night making herself the center of attention . She was a show-off . About the absolute worst thing you could have said about me at the beginning of that one night was that I hated her . " Park yourself right here next to Kathy , " my mother said brightly . " Some entertainment while you work . " She patted my head and went off to sort unmentionables with the other mothers . It was almost Thanksgiving , and our parish 's annual clothing drive was on . The timing was supposed to make the most of any reflections you might be having about how blessed you are , and to nudge you toward being that much more generous with the things that you did n't fit in anymore , or did n't feel like repairing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never liked in the first place . It worked . Every single November , people filled their trash bags and cardboard boxes with coats and trousers and blouses and shoes , depositing everything in a heap at the foot of the stage in our school hall . The mound grew overnight , in a way that would seem magical if you did n't know that the nuns kept the doors unlocked to accept donations until 8:00 P.M. " Thank you , thank you , " the sisters would chant as the people filed in . Then they added the same line they drilled into us nearly every day : " If you only knew how bad they have it over there . " " They " were the poor people , and " there " was the old country . On my globe I could pick it out from the rest of the other old countries for its purple color and its medallion shape . I knew where to locate it on the cold metal world that spun on my bookcase , but I had never actually been there . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why all of us now lived over here . Nothing was good over there . That 's what they told me . There were wars . Mean people in charge . Regular good people who lived there suffered even now . If you wanted milk or bread , you had to stand in line for ages . It was so bad that many just upped and left . That 's what my grandparents did , traveling all the way to this state shaped like an arm flexing its bicep . That 's how my parents came to be born here . And me , too , now a fifth  --  grade girl alive and living in America . " You do n't know how lucky you are , " my grandparents would tell me over and over . I never came up with a reply , as I really knew no one 's circumstances but my own . Once a year , though , I got a glimpse . in the form of a thank-you note sent by the people living in whatever bad-off old-country village the Mothers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother and me came to the school after supper to work , never taking off our coats and hats because the thermostat got cranked way down after the final school bell . We sorted , folded , wrapped , taped , and addressed , all to have the packages ready for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception a couple of weeks later , when a man backed up his big truck and took everything to the shipping company . That was the end of it , until months later , usually around Easter , when we 'd get this note written on paper so flimsy you could almost see through it . " THANK YOU " somebody who knew English would print big . Then there would be a couple of other words we did n't understand . The nuns would interpret : " Clothing here . God good . " THE POOR PEOPLE I KNEW were those on TV . They were mostly Negro or Chinese or some type of person with features different from my own who could not be found on my street unless they were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes were going to were said to look just like us because they lived where we would be living if circumstances were different . Looking just like us , minus the educations in our heads , and the liberty in our government , and the full stomachs under our red-and-green-plaid school uniforms . " We are all brothers and sisters , " said the nuns . As I did n't have any of those , I was all the more intrigued . What were their names ? What did they do all day ? What did they look like ? I would have appreciated a photograph to place next to my own and note our similarities , just to see what I would look like if I one day woke up and owned nothing but my own skin . Until I could do that , I would have to imagine . That 's what I did that night , sitting there on the pile of donations and shutting my eyes tightly . Closed eyes were the key to imagining anything . It was tough to make things up otherwise . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly , as it might look if we were poor . The soft bed , the little wooden chair and desk , the mirrored dresser , the big angled closet , the full toy box , the messy bookcase , the globe - all gone . My room became a shoebox with one window that looked out into the Kiviors " clothesline . I made that go away , too . All I saw now was the nothing I would have if I had nothing . It honestly scared me . I opened my eyes . Peering around the heap , I saw my mother seated at the first gray table in the cafeteria , her and Mrs. Bigda and Mrs. Church and Mrs. Pilch , all of them pouring coffees and talking . I took some pants and made them my starting point . That was how you did this . You picked an item and then you found all the others like it . Then you broke that down into smaller piles - for women , for men , for kids , for babies . Pants were fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sending somebody a used Kleenex , or a shopping list that might make them feel bad by showing them all the stuff we easily could afford . You certainly did n't want to ship half a world away somebody 's change purse or house keys or , in the case of Dottie Luzi last year searching through a woman 's dingy white ski jacket , a small golden watch with the most delicate chain linking the ends of the bracelet . I was finding nothing that exciting . Kathy Zuba was moving through " The Volga Boatmen . " A working number . I worked . Levi 's . Wranglers . Dickies . Corduroys . Bell-bottoms . Beltless polyester trousers like my father wore on Sundays . Elastic-waisted old-lady styles . Overalls . A quarter , three nickels , a penny , a ripped-out classified ad for a boat trailer , a couple of rubber bands , a fine-line blue Bic , and a cherry throat lozenge still in its wrapper . The mothers now were sorting skirts . Mrs. Bigda held a sheer red one up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with it or she 'd be responsible for a riot on another continent . Everybody was laughing in the background the moment I spotted the sweater . I should say that I did n't see the whole entire thing at once . I first noticed a cuff . But that was all I needed . Even those few inches held enough fascination - a couple of rows of beige yarn that alternated with a cream color , then ended with the blue that made up the arm I reached for and drew slowly from the rest of the pile . It was the color of the sky on the best day of your life . Parakeet breast , ocean in my aunt 's slides of Florida , St. Mary 's shawl . The touch of the yarn was like air . The center of fresh bread . The whipped hand cream my mother bought from the woman who came to the door . My cousin Tanya 's rabbit when she first got it . I was lucky enough to have owned some fancy things during my few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I held the cuff with my fingers for who knows how long before I slowly pulled to see more . A shoulder . A collar . It was a cardigan . Beige yarn edging the neck in the same striped pattern , and making up the placket to which eight pearly buttons were sewn . I flattened the whole thing against the mountain and smoothed it with my hands . It did n't so much sit there as it floated over the kind of plain cloth coat that Mrs. Nixon was bragging about owning , and above the pair of navy swim trunks somebody thoughtfully had clothespinned to a beach  --  towel souvenir of Horseneck . I held the sweater against my coat . The arms hit mine down to my wrists , and the waist fell to my own . Everything perfect-plus brand-new . I could tell this because the little plastic string that once held the price was still attached to the manufacturer 's tag , a golden card printed with one word : " Ingenue . " I was n't sure what that meant . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't yet know . But that moment , there in the valley with the Ingenue perfect in front of me , I knew this sweater would have to become mine . The speed with which I did the following surprised me , though thinking of it now , it comes back to me in slow motion . How I turned to check on Katy still with her back to me , then on the mothers busy taping up boxes . I balled up the sweater and shoved it inside my boring old stadium coat . I walked fast down the corridor on legs that had their own brains telling them to go over there , take that right  --  that 'll get you into the room marked " Girls . " Inside , I shut the door , flipped on the lights , and ran to the farthest stall . I bolted myself in and leaned against the partition , breathing hard like I 'd just run around the world . I stuck my hand inside my coat . There was the fluff of the yarn and the cool edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweating palm . I 'd really done it . All I can say is sometimes you just do things . And this was one of them . I flopped my coat over the door . I looked down at the sweater I had on , the ugly brown one with the V neck trimmed with orange knitted ruffles , the bottom points of each hung with big brown and orange pom-poms . It was made by my mother , who just last winter had learned to knit from some lady at bowling who used heavy rug yarn no matter the project because , whatever it was , she said she wanted it to be long-lived . " It 's pretty , " I had tried to say with enthusiasm when I unwrapped it the morning of my birthday and found something I would n't be caught dead in . I wore it the afternoon she gave it to me and just one other time - that night at the school hall - only because I knew it was going to be freezing and that I would n't be removing my coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming downstairs wearing it that all the many times I 'd pushed it aside for something better rolled up and hurt me all at once . But there in the stall , the way I was seeing it then , a sweater like this rightfully should be sent to a place where people have little to wear , and lots of cold . One underprivileged girl could be wearing just this one sweater , rather than a layering of four or five others that could be shared . For her , I pulled it over my head . " You all right ? " My mother 's voice echoed off the tin ceiling , startling me . I flushed the toilet even though I had n't used it , and I moved to make rustling sounds like I was somebody getting herself back together . " Fine , " I managed . " There 's cookies . Come on out . " " OK . " I waited until the door clicked shut and her footsteps faded . I left the stall and splashed my face . And checked that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had n't come in the building with was showing itself to the world . THE COOKIES were actually hermits . Mrs. Pilch had made them and had brought them to the school already cut up on a piece of cardboard covered with tinfoil so she would n't have to worry about leaving behind a good serving tray . The bars were spicy with the healthy things like raisins chopped up and sneaked in so you might never know you were doing some good for yourself while enjoying dessert . I was n't hungry . I only had one because my mother made me . At home , I ran up to my room and in front of the full-length mirror on the back of my closed door I got my first look at myself wearing something truly fine . I fastened the buttons neatly , pulling the pointy collar of my white school blouse over the neckline . I got very close to the mirror and tilted my head to one side and then the other , the way I saw ladies doing in magazine ads . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have a better home here than in the old country . Just like my grandparents . Just like my parents . Just like me . " You do n't know how they have it there , " I whispered to it . " You do n't know how lucky you are . " OTHER THAN THAT ONE TIME , I NEVER wore the thing . Never . How could I ? My mother knew everything I owned , as she was the one who shopped . What would I say if she saw me in it and asked me where 'd I get it ? I 'd have to lie , that it was borrowed from Rosemary or Rosalie or Roseanne . But she knows how I look when I lie , something she has reminded me of often and something I ca n't understand because I have stood in front of the mirror and said terribly untrue things like " I hate God " just to see the difference in me . I can never spot it . But my mother can . So the sweater remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back behind the bottom drawer , where movie spies hid things . I wrapped it in thin plastic from the dry cleaners to keep the dust off and any moths away . Once a week , usually on a quiet Sunday night , I 'd lock my door , slide the drawer onto the floor , and reach back into the empty space with my whole arm . Most times I 'd take the thing out and unwrap it and hold it up against myself . Sometimes I 'd only touch the plastic , and I 'd push softly at the knit just to make sure it was still there . The first bad thing 1 ever did haunting me months later . I 'd put back the drawer and go to bed . Depending on how tired I was , I might think of some girl in the old country wearing the sweater . What she 'd look like , no matter what she was wearing , was just like me - more bones than fat , blond hair in braids , the light gray eyes of a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door to hang a full-length mirror on . So she 'd run to the rain barrel near her barn to get a glimpse of herself wearing something truly fine . Down at her church , where the boxes were unloaded , she 'd come across the sweater herself and it had been like touching flour . Petals . Down . Young grass . A horse nose . The color of the blue matched a bird egg . The veins on the top of her feet . The wide one-legged country her grandfather 's map called America . She buttoned the sweater , and held her hair back as she peered down into the still water . The girl did n't know about magazine models , but she knew she looked good . She would also say that she would make great use of the sweater , even if it was too nice to ever wear . Somebody did n't want it , so she would take it . It would have a better home here . Just like her grandparents . Just like her parents . Just like her . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Containing a letter , and a photograph . Of a girl . Who looked like me . More bones than fat , blond hair in braids , the light gray eyes of a ghost . Holding a piece of wood painted with the words " WE TANK YOU . " And all wrapped up in my brown and orange sweater . There could n't be another . Anywhere in the world . Thick as it looked and with the ruffle and the balls hanging off it . " This just shows you , " Sister Consolata said . " See how bad they have it over there ? " Then she came over to me , there in the second row . The hair on my neck snapped straight . My heart flew to escape my insides . " Take this to your mother , to show the other mothers , " she said happily . And the girl landed in front of me in that way . SOMETIMES YOU JUST DO THINGS , AND this is one of them , done by me every week , usually on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide the drawer out , and reach back into the space . Most times I take the sweater out . Other times I only touch the plastic , just to make sure it is still in there . And I feel for the small square photograph to know that has n't been found either . Then I put back the drawer and go to bed and try to dream back to the very recent days before I had ever done even one bad thing . When I did n't know how hollow just one , then just one other , could leave you most moments . When I did n't know how bad other people had it . When I did n't know how lucky I was .
