<p> A 57-year-old black-and-white movie most Americans have never seen is the best American movie of all time . <p> " Star Wars is a better science-fiction movie than 2001 : A Space Odyssey , E.T . the Extra-Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind . " <p> Character actor Ward Bond was in more great movies than Humphrey Bogart , Katharine Hepburn and Marlon Brando . <p> " The Graduate is the best American comedy of all time , High Noon the best western , The Wizard of Oz " the best musical . <p> Rather than ending debate , the American Film Institute 's 18-month effort to select the 100 Greatest American Movies of All Time is sure to create endless arguments . <p> And that is brilliant . Because the idea behind the Greatest 100 list , which was to be revealed Tuesday night , is to boost interest in America 's rich and wonderful film heritage . <p> The list also serves as a nice contrast to the common rankings of top moneymakers that prove more about marketing than quality or art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiences , prejudices and ages of those who voted on it . People tend to be most impressed by films they saw when they were young and first aware of the artistry and power of movies . Since most voters were past that age , they were less likely to vote for recent movies . <p> The results of voting by as many as 1,500 Americans - film-industry insiders plus a few others - were to be announced Tuesday night on " AFI 's 100 Years . . . 100 Movies " on CBS . The movies were made during the first century of American filmmaking , 1896-1996 . ( So do n't get upset if you think " Titanic " should be on the list : It came out too late . ) <p> It will be no surprise to any student of film that , as on many best-film lists , " Citizen Kane " came out on top . <p> The masterful Orson Welles film , a thinly disguised and unflattering pastiche based on the life of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst , has long and widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be hard for modern viewers , trained to care about big scenes and wild plots , to spot what makes this film so important . That 's partly because so much of what Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland accomplished has become the standard language of film . Understanding the film 's significance requires knowing what was usual before " Kane " came along . <p> Far more popular are other films in the list 's Top 10 , including the perennial favorites " Casablanca , Gone With the Wind " ( the all-time top moneymaker when figures are adjusted for inflation ) , " The Wizard of Oz , The Graduate and Singin ' in the Rain . " <p> Few movies on the list can be considered total surprises , though plenty will debate the inclusion of " Dances With Wolves , Dr. Zhivago , Giant , Pulp Fiction , Unforgiven , Platoon or Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner . " <p> More surprising are some of the pictures that did n't make the list .

" <p> Film writers and fans will analyze the significance of the list and its oddities for some time to come . Here are a few to get you started : <p> Steven Spielberg , who had to wait until 1993 to get a best-director Academy Award for " Schindler 's List " ( ranked No. 9 ) , directed five movies on the list . The other four are " E.T . ( 25 ) , Jaws ( 48 ) , Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 60 ) and Close Encounters " ( 64 ) . He beat out Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder , who directed four each . <p> Katharine Hepburn is the leading lady with the most films : " The African Queen ( 17 ) , The Philadelphia Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner " ( 99 ) . Natalie Wood , Diane Keaton and Faye Dunaway had three each . <p> James Stewart and Robert De Niro lead all leading men with five films each . De Niro 's are " Raging Bull ( 24 ) , The Godfather Part II ( 32 ) , Taxi Driver ( 47 ) , The Deer Hunter ( 79 ) and Goodfellas ( 94 ) . Stewart 's five are It 's a Wonderful Life ( 11 ) , Mr. Smith Goes to Washington ( 29 ) , Rear Window ( 42 ) , The Philadelphia Story ( 51 ) and Vertigo " ( 61 ) . <p> Beating all actors was Ward Bond , one of the most popular and prolific character actors in Hollywood history . He had supporting roles in seven movies on the list : " It Happened One Night ( 35 ) , Bringing Up Baby ( 97 ) , Gone With the Wind ( 4 ) , The Grapes of Wrath ( 21 ) , The Maltese Falcon ( 23 ) , It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 96 ) . <p> Voters seemed to agree with the popular notion that 1939 was the best year in American movie history , with five films on the list . <p> The only sequel on the list is " The Godfather Part II . It 's one of the few sequels often noted as better than its original , The Godfather " ( 3 ) . <p> The oldest film on the list is " The Birth of a Nation ( 1915 ) . The most recent is Fargo " ( 1996 ) . <p> 100 Greatest American Movies <p> 1 . Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) <p> 2 . Casablanca ( 1942 ) <p> 3 . The Godfather ( 1972 ) <p> 4 .
