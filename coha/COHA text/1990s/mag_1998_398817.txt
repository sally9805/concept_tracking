In 1987 , Andrew Tobias told you what he liked Headnote for the next 10 years . He picked some winners and a few duds too . Here 's what happened to all of them - and a few thoughts for now . Photograph Tobias , author of My Vast Fortune , sees blue skies ahead and says you should keep as much as 30% of your money in international mutual funds . // So I got this e-mail from Larry in cyberspace : " After the market crashed in October 1987 , you wrote an article for a major magazine suggesting 10 investment ideas . Now that it is 10 years later , could you revisit these and discuss their performance ? I think the article was in MONEY magazine . " I had forgotten all about this , let alone what fool things I had recommended . But Larry was right . The article was in the December 1987 issue of MONEY , and it was called " Your 10 Best Investments for 1988 ( Slightly Revised ) . " The parenthetical " revised " part had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had occurred in between my first and final drafts . ( I was n't sure what to make of the crash , but I knew I should be doing something . ) My general outlook back then was guardedly optimistic . " Chances are that we will muddle through , " the piece began in the aftermath of the crash . And , of course , with hindsight it 's clear we not only muddled , we gold-medaled . I think there 's a reasonable chance that we may continue to shine economically in the decade ahead-these are phenomenally exciting times . But , for investors , the " easy money " has been made . The tremendous decline in inflation that led to a boom in bond and stock prices has very little room left to go . Indeed , at some point disinflation could turn into deflation-I 'm not predicting it-and as I recollect ancient history ( the 1930s ) , you do n't want to be around if it does . So there are things to feel great about . But just as we were surprised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never forget the possibility of unpleasant surprises these next 10 . Anyway , here are my top 10 investments as they appeared in 1987 , what 's happened to each since , and some thoughts for the years ahead : 1 . ONE SHARE OF Berkshire Hathaway . Warren Buffett 's stock sold for $3,000 at the time , today it 's around $44,000 . I 'd like to tell you I was smart enough to buy it myself , to enjoy that 31% annual compounding . But ever since I started writing about Berkshire , at $300 a share in 1979 , I 've thought it was a little " ahead of itself " - and I think it may be even more so today . The Buffett/Munger brains are still there , and there are none better . My instinct is that Buffett , 67 , will turn out to rival Harvard class of 1917 investor Philip Carret , 101 , for longevity , or possibly even his own Rose Blumkin , whose Nebraska Furniture Mart he proudly purchased , and who was riding around her giant store in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more , the leverage provided by Berkshire 's underlying insurance operations is still there . And yet ... well , last time it was first on my list , though I was too dumb to buy it myself . This time , at this price , I would hold off until Berkshire catches up with itself . 2 . A FARM IN IOWA . ( " Or just about any place else farmland sells for a third of what it did six or eight years ago . " ) This was also a good one . My own Iowa farm cost $550 an acre in 1986 and today is worth a little more than double that . In the meantime I 've been getting rent that works out to more than a 10% return a year , all nicely leveraged by the low-interest mortgage provided to buy it . No Berkshire Hathaway , perhaps , but more my style : I like to buy things when everyone else is running for the hills . Sometimes it turns out a monster really is coming and I , the tempting valley morsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fears were exaggerated , the cycle turns , and everyone eventually comes running back down from the hills . Today , farmland is no bargain-but Asia may be . For most of us , that would mean taking a look at lowexpense , no-load Pacific-focused mutual funds . 3 . UBS . Savings Bonds/ MUNICIPAL BONDS . Obviously no fireworks here , but that was not the point . Nobody lost a dime on these ( even the creditors of Orange County came out whole ) , few paid any taxes ( other than capital gains on the municipal bonds and federal income tax on the savings bonds if they were cashed in ) , and the money grew . In hindsight , of course , this was , relatively speaking , a terrible investment-one should simply have put all one 's money in Intel or Microsoft ( or Berkshire Hathaway ) . But what if George Bush had died of that stomach flu in Japan , leaving President Quayle to lead the world ? He might have done a great job , or maybe only the golf-club stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total global panic . Okay , okay , maybe this is unfair to Dan Quayle . But my point is : We do n't know what 's going to happen ! It 's not stupid , especially for those who ca n't afford much risk , to have some money in safe fixed-income investments . ( It can also make sense to have some money in risky fixed-income investments . For that , one needs to go in with both eyes wide open . ) Today , U.S. Savings Bonds ( EE bonds yielding 5.6% ) remain a reasonable investment for the small saver . And municipal bonds should not be sniffed at , particularly if they 're general-obligation bonds ( G.O.s ) , which carry the guarantee of the local taxing authority and almost never , ever fail . High-quality munis are safe and today yield upwards of 5% tax-free . If your combined marginal federal and local income tax rate is high-for some investors , 40e or even 50e of each additional dollar of interest is taxed away-they have obvious appeal . Remember , this notion that the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to be a lot of disappointed stock mutual fundholders over the next decade if they expect it to be anywhere near as good as the last one . 4 . Short JAPAN . Fortunately , because the Nikkei index kept rising even higher , there was no easy way to do this at the time . ( " The surest sign you should short Japanese stocks , " I wrote , " is that it 's all but impossible to do . It 's often when an investment is difficult to make that it may make the most sense because few are doing it . " ) And the few Japanese stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange were n't nearly as overvalued as the rest . So those , as the article pointed out , were n't the ones to short . Had you nonetheless found a way to short Japan , and held on , you would have done very nicely What happened in actual fact is that near the tippy-top-around 40,000 on the Nikkei index in late 1989-it finally , and blessedly , did become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment banking firms issued " Nikkei puts , " securities that would be worthless if the Japanese market held firm but that proved extraordinarily valuable as the Nikkei proceeded to dive below 16,000 . Today , the Japanese market seems neither wildly over- nor undervalued to this nonexpert . Those with 100% of their equity portfolio in U.S. stocks should , in my view , consider allocating 20% of it to international index funds and perhaps another 5% or 10% to emerging market funds . 5 . Short the Korea Fund . At the time I wrote this in my first draft , the closedend fund was selling for $82 a share , which was 150% more than its underlying net asset value . ( A closedend fund sells a set number of shares to the public once and then closes its doors to further investment . If you want out , you ca n't redeem your shares for the net asset value-your proportionate share of the fund 's assets . Instead , you can only sell them to somebody else for however much or little the market is willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset value , it was like four quarters selling for $2.50 . Crazy . Having made a huge profit in a couple of months as KF dropped from $82 to $49 , covered my short . But I might just as well have held on . A decade later , it was around $7-this time selling for a 17% discount to its net asset value-like four quarters selling for 83 cents . So this is not the worst time to buy a little ( or shares in the other closed-ends that invest in Korean stocks ) . But again , I am truly no expert . 6 . Closed-end funds AT A DISCOUNT . I suggested five of them , all selling at discounts to their net asset value : Gabelli Equity Trust , Zweig Fund , Schafer Value Trust , Royce Value Trust and Growth Stock Outlook Trust . Had you invested $10,000 in each on Dec. 1,1987 and reinvested the dividends , your $50,000 would today be worth about $235,000 . That 's 16.7% a year-good , but not all that great for the past decade . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way . Your $10,000 in Mario Gabelli 's fund would have grown to $50,000 and change ( 17.4% compounded ) and to just a bit less in Charles Royce 's . Marty Zweig would have taken your $10,000 up to around $43,000 , at this writing ( 15.7% ) . Growth Stock Outlook Trust changed its name to the Charles Allmon Trust , and then the fund was bought and its name changed again to Liberty All-Star Growth . Had you stuck with it all that time : $28,000 or so ( 10.8% ) . As for the Schafer Value Trust , it was liquidated in 1991 . But if we substitute the Strong Schafer Value fund , an open-end fund managed by the same man , $10,000 would have brought you about $60,000 . The appeal of closed-ends , when you can find them at a significant discount , remains the same as in 1987 : getting $1 worth of stocks for 80 cents , say . You also get the manager 's skill ; but he or she has to beat the market by at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing at the market as a whole-and few do . So $1 selling for 90 cents may be more sensible than it appears . This dollar might throw off only 9 in dividends and gains , because of the management fee , where a direct investment in the same stocks would yield a dime . I 'd recommend another list of good closed-ends selling at fat discounts , but guess what ? When the stock market has done as well as this one has , good closedends generally do n't sell at fat discounts . Ironically , it 's typically when stocks are cheap that the closed-end discounts widen , making them cheaper still . 7 . CASH . By this I meant money you kept on the sidelines , earning interest , waiting for amazing opportunities . Well , this is never a terrible idea . Just what opportunities you might have spotted over the months and years that followed the 1987 article I ca n't say , but there were lots of them . By the same token , we will have amazing opportunities over the next decade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though we never lack for those . I 'm talking about panics that result in temporary buying opportunities for the brave at heart ; and even the occasional legitimate private investment opportunity-maybe your brother-in-law really does have a great invention in the garage-though these are obviously even harder to come across as well as being more difficult to evaluate . Just what percentage of your assets to keep in cash is up to you . And , of course , I do n't mean cash cash . I 'm thinking of some safe , liquid , interest-bearing thing like a bank account , money-market fund or short-term Treasuries . Ed. : To find the names of the best cash havens for ' 98 , see the box on page 102 . The really rich need zero cash-they can always borrow at low rates . The poor should hold 100% of their savings in cash . You probably fall someplace in between . Over the long run , you want most of your long-term money in long-term kinds of investments , not cash . But that 's not to say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something that feels " just right " to come along . 8 . TAX CERTIFICATES . The basic idea was to earn a safe 18% a year on your money by participating in auctions some counties hold to collect back property taxes . You pay the tax for the delinquent property owner , and then , if for some crazy reason you get lucky and the owner fails to pay you in a couple of years , you get the property ! So you 're virtually guaranteed a nice return on small chunks of dough , or else- " worst case " - you get the property instead for the price of a couple of years ' property taxes . I do n't know how this may have changed since then ( except that interest rates on everything , including these , have come down ) , and I 'm sure in some localities there are far more pitfalls than there were in Dade County , Fla. the year I did it . So if you look into this , be careful . Do n't , for example , buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that , as the new owner a couple of years from now , you 're liable for some million-dollar environmental cleanup . But basically , though this kind of investing is labor intensive-it tends to be a lot of odd little $1,844 and $2,329 investments , each of which you have to keep track of-if you do careful research , I expect this can still make sense in some parts of the country You certainly wo n't have much competition from , say , George Soros or Goldman Sachs . 9 . A house in Miami . Well , this would have been great advice had I appended " Beach " - Miami Beach , which really took off in this past decade . Miami generally turned out only okay . You would have been better off just tossing your marbles into the stock market . ( Then again , with a house or a rental property in Miami , it would not have been unusual or imprudent to make the investment on 80% " margin " - i.e. , a mortgage . So even if it had appreciated only 3% a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your operating expenses and debt service , you 'd have been earning more like 15% on your actual cash down payment . ) I think you could still do worse than to buy a place in an area you 'd like to retire to one day and rent it out . The long-term gradual rise in real estate prices is probably far from over . But do n't do this casually either . Once in , it 's not like picking up the phone and calling your broker to get out . Owning rental property is n't just an investment , it 's ajob. 10 . BUY STAPLES ? This was my old thing about buying in bulk when stuff 's on sale-shaving cream , tuna fish , wine , whatever-to make $1,000 stretch to buy $1,400 of the very same stuff you would have bought in the course of the year anyway . That 's a 40% tax-free , risk-free return and never goes out of style . ( You would not have done badly buying Staples either . The office-supply chain went public in 1989 and , at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) All in all , it could have been worse . The great luxury of the 1987 environment was that lots of investment merchandise was on sale . Today at least as I write this , with the Dow bouncing up and down to the north and south of 8000 , it 's tougher to find a bargain . The big picture is great . Even adding back the Social Security surplus-which is incorrectly used to make the $58.3 billion budget deficit appear smaller than it is-the national debt is growing slower than , and thus shrinking relative to , the economy as a whole . That 's great news and may well continue . Largely as a result , inflation and interest rates are low , with the pressure of competition from freer trade and the improvements in productivity from technology working to keep them low . Technology and a belief in free enterprise are grabbing billions of new participants too . I can be on AOL and , noticing my partner in Moscow is online ( or might he be in Kiev tonight ? ) , start " chatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to have an Ugandan business partner with whom I 'll be able to do much the same thing early next year . This was not possible a decade ago , and barely imaginable , both for technological and political reasons , two decades ago . So , to the list of perennial basic great investments-e.g. , pay off your credit cards and earn 18% or 22% tax-free , risk-free , by not having to pay that in interest each month-add this one : Buy your child or grandchild a new computer . ( What to do with his or her old one ? Well , maybe you can use it yourself . ) I 'm not suggesting you invest directly in Ukraine or Uganda , let alone sight unseen with your child 's $999 Compaq over the Internet-not in a million years . The most sensible way to invest in equities is generally via no-load , low-expense index funds , both here and abroad , perhaps spicing up your portfolio with a dash of emerging market funds and perhaps a few stocks you choose yourself . Emerging markets are sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more for active fund management may be both necessary and rewarding . See you in 2007 .
