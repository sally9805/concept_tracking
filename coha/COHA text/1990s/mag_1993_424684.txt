The Viacoms , Bell Atlantics and Time Warners wo n't be the only winners in multimedia . In its quiet way , H &R; Block is set to become a successful specialized player . <p> SMART BUSINESS PEOPLE know that even economically disastrous government policies can provide moneymaking opportunities . Consider H &R; Block Inc. , which has grown fat and prosperous as the U.S. income tax code has become ever more complex and trapped additional millions of people in its web . <p> Last year H &R; Block , tax accountant to the masses , grossed $1.5 billion and netted $181 million . A full 48% of these revenues came from preparing income tax returns for 18 million people at fees averaging around $50 . The company has a market capitalization of $4 billion , and Henry Bloch 's 5.4% interest has appreciated to nearly $240 million . <p> But trees do n't grow to the sky . <p> Hence this year for the first time in over a decade Block held its annual meeting , not in its hometown of Kansas City , Mo . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with symbolism . Columbus is headquarters to CompuServe Inc. , H &R; Block 's on-line computer information services , networking and software subsidiary . CompuServe 's $315 million in 1993 revenues will account for barely 20% of H &R; Block 's revenues , but it is Block 's best bet for carving out a major stake in the heralded multimedia age . <p> CompuServe represents the growth engine of H &R; Block , ' says Thomas Bloch , 39 , who succeeded his father Henry as chief executive in August 1992 . Frankly , I do n't see any dramatic growth left in the tax business . ' <p> Why not ? Certainly taxes are n't going down  --  anywhere . But the number of taxpayers has stopped growing , and with it Block 's potential market . Last year was the first time in the company 's 38-year history that H &R; Block actually experienced a decline in the number of tax returns it prepared , and in the number of refunds its customers received . <p> The drop was almost invisible  --  less than one half of 1% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect profitability . But the cessation of growth had dire implications for the stock 's price , which at 40 is 21 times projected 1994 earnings , a premium over the S &P; 500 . <p> To continue justifying this lofty price , the company must promise more growth than can be expected from filling in 1040s . H &R; Block is turning to technology and financial services for its future . <p> To lead the strategic transformation , Henry Bloch hired William Anderson as vice president of corporate development in late 1991 . Anderson , 44 , now chief financial officer , is the former head of the mergers and acquisitions practice of accounting giant KPMG Peat Marwick . Although he does n't have the title , for all practical purposes Anderson seems to share the role of chief executive officer with young Tom Bloch . <p> Anderson has gotten the company moving fast in the new direction . In October , Block announced it would pay $44 million for ailing Fairfield , Conn. - based MECA Software , Inc. , a company whose main products include TaxCut , Andrew J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A few weeks later Block announced that it would be selling its $451 million ( 1993 revenues ) temporary clerical and health care personnel subsidiary , Interim Services Inc. , to the public . <p> With Interim a separate company , Block has more the look of a company focused on computers , communications and financial services . The sale of the stock to the public is expected to raise as much as $250 million  --  for more acquisitions . <p> A recent aquisition was that of a small Utah-based industrial-loan shell company . Block will eventually use it to participate in making refund-anticipation loans to its electronic filing customers . Together with Mellon Bank , Block earns lucrative fees on this low-risk business . <p> Come January , Anderson plans to use the loan company to tap H &R; Block 's 18-million-client base and CompuServe 's 1.5 million subscriber households with offers of secured , standard and gold Visa and MasterCard credit cards . <p> We have two tremendous distribution channels  --  the Block tax offices , which focus on the lower-end consumers , and CompuServe , which focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge is to build new services and products and push them through the distribution channels . CompuServe 's customer base is the kind that would make most credit card companies drool . ' <p> CompuServe , purchased in 1980 for just $23 million , has evolved from a small diversification effort in corporate time-sharing into a gold mine for H &R; Block . The nation 's preeminent on-line computer and networking service , CompuServe is responsible for developing H &R; Block 's electronic tax filing business and recently helped computerize the tax preparation process in Block 's 9,500 tax offices . <p> CompuServe now provides all of the dial-up card verification services for Visa members and does most of the computerized crew scheduling for the airline industry . Its subscriber base of 1.5 million households is almost 50% larger than ailing Prodigy 's and is growing at 16,000 per week . CompuServe 's $74 million in pretax income in fiscal 1993 was nearly twice the total revenues of its other fast growing competitor , America Online . Earnings and revenues are growing at over 30% per year , and CompuServe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CompuServe is run by Maurice Cox , a mathematician and computer scientist who was a marketing executive at Control Data before joining CompuServe in 1979 , a year before Block bought the company . Cox is a dedicated user , carrying a small Hewlett-Packard HP100LX palmtop computer and a pocket modem , with which he taps into CompuServe while on the road . <p> Cox is well aware that while CompuServe has a head start in interactive media , the corporate giants are muscling in fast  --  AT &T,; MCI , Microsoft , Bell Atlantic , you name them . He is also readying CompuServe for the onslaught of wireless communication and cable technology and the prospect of utilizing the company 's services on platforms that are different from personal computers . Early next year CompuServe will introduce a CD-ROM product that will provide historical information and also allow audio and video transmissions . <p> Says Cox , We want to be a global information- and communications-oriented service that supports the needs and interests of businesses and consumers . ' <p> That 's a tall order , given that half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as yet just beginning , market . While CompuServe does n't have much experience in the entertainment business , H &R; Block has plenty in financial services , and CompuServe itself offers a good deal of financial information and chitchat . Soon CompuServe subscribers will be able to download updates to software programs like MECA 's TaxCut . Later CompuServe may offer other financial advice and products . <p> People are estimating that around 10% of the traffic on the so-called information superhighway will be financial , be it home banking , insurance or mutual funds , ' says Anderson . That is our strongest niche , and what we are focusing on . ' By the end of the coming tax season , H &R; Block will have amassed some $750 million in cash for acquisitions to further strengthen its position . <p> As chief executive , Thomas Bloch sometimes strikes people as being in over his head in all this technology . But he is clearly smart enough to know what he does n't know , and has the good sense to delegate authority to those who do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot strategy and direct the company into the future . <p> When people think multimedia and computer/communications these days , they do n't automatically think H &R; Block . Yet this company may turn out to be one of the real winners . After all , there 's going to be a lot more to multimedia than just calling up movies and shopping for crummy jewelry . <p> PHOTO : H &R; Block founder Henry and son Thomas Bloch .
