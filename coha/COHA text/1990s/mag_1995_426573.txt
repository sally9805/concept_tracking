Section : Defense &; Technology <p> THERE are really two questions here : First , should NATO survive ? And second , will it ? It is easier to answer a firm yes to the first question than to the second . <p> Lord Ismay , NATO 's first secretary general , made the famous ( or infamous ) wisecrack that the purpose of the North Atlantic Alliance was to keep the Americans in Europe , the Russians out , and the Germans down . The reference to our democratic German ally is invidious and a distortion , but Lord Ismay was not wrong to touch on the three elements of the Alliance 's geopolitical purpose : to ensure an American military presence in Europe , as a counterweight to Russian power , and as an ultimate reassurance of Germany 's benign place in the Western security system . Obviously the Russian threat has receded , but the structural problem of European security turns out to be a major intellectual and political challenge in the new era nonetheless . Not in fifty years , in fact , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stabilizing functions of the Alliance turn out to be still valuable  --  indeed , there is no adequate substitute  --  especially with respect to both post-Communist Russia and newl y unified Germany . <p> Bismarck reputedly once said : Russia is never as strong , or as weak , as it appears . This was wise . Today 's East - West balance of power on the Continent is a benign one , with the Red Army out of Central and Eastern Europe and with U.S. forces in Europe reduced by two-thirds . Nevertheless , the principle of equilibrium must still be observed . Russia is a huge concentration of power on the Eurasian landmass ; it has been a clumsy and erratic factor in European politics for all modern history , even before the Bolsheviks and thermonuclear weapons . Today , Russia 's military might is much reduced but still out of proportion to that of its neighbors . Its domestic evolution is uncertain , to put it mildly , and it has been throwing its weight around in its immediate neighborhood . There is no adequate counterweight without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most positive future relationship between Russia and the West depends on this . <p> Whether to enlarge NATO is a separate question . The geopolitical logic of doing so is not to respond to any immediate Russian threat but to erase any ambiguity about the outcome of 1989 : Central Europe now consists of free and independent states that have chosen to be part of the West ; Russian acceptance of this is the sine qua non of any relationship with the West . Extension of NATO 's security umbrella eastward is not a change in the present status quo but a necessary consolidation of it . <p> Germany , as noted above , has been a faithful democratic ally for forty years . It has also become the dominant economic power in Europe . Historically , economic strength has always translated sooner or later into military strength . What has , uniquely in history , divorced German ( and Japanese ) economic power from any security implications has been Germany 's ( and Japan 's ) tight military link with the United States . Everybody has gained from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically without raising fears of more problematic forms of hegemony ; Europe and Asia have gained a vital reassurance . That is one reason for the Germans ' eagerness now to enlarge NATO : they are wise enough to see that their own activism in Central Europe has different implications if it is part of a collective presence from the ones it would have if Germany were acting unilaterally . <p> Despite some illusions in Brussels , the European Union can not perform this function of anchoring Germany to the Western security framework . Germany , now unified , is even stronger  --  and more assertive  --  than before . The French strategy of taming Germany though monetary union and a European army is an empty one ; all it has done is strangle the French economy and dilute Germany 's commitment to NATO . It is not only the small states of Eastern and Central Europe that would be left vulnerable without the Americans ; Western Europe too would become unhinged without the American security presence . <p> To state all this is not to make an ethnic slur against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define a structural problem  --  one of disproportionate power that needs to be counterbalanced . This is the geopolitical function that the Alliance has performed successfully since it was founded . The need has not disappeared . <p> THE debate over NATO 's enlargement is taking place in a decidedly uncongenial environment , as its cohesion is weakened by U.S. troop cuts , proliferating disputes ( Bosnia , Iran , Iraq , trade ) , and feeble leadership in key capitals . The telling point has been made that for the Alliance to expand in these circumstances is like a couple whose marriage is in trouble deciding to have a baby in the hope that it will save the relationship . <p> The glue of an obvious and immediate military threat is gone . On both sides of the ocean , popular pressures work against the Alliance . Some question why any U.S. troops are needed ; others are preoccupied with the disputes that tear away at any lingering sense of common interest . Even Europeans who value the American connection begin to doubt our staying power and look for hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves toward a European army . <p> Preserving the Alliance , however , remains the preference of all the allied governments . It is , after all , the natural grouping of the Western democracies  --  the partners we turn to first in a crisis . The realities of Russia and Germany will , over time , reawaken consciousness of the underlying geopolitical necessity . The Alliance can be saved from its infirmities . <p> What is required for this is , above all , a reinvigorated and coherent American policy . This means no further reductions below 100,000 troops ; it means a foreign policy that shows more respect for allies ' interests ( in , e.g. , Northern Ireland and Algeria ) ; it means bolder U.S. leadership in finding a decisive way of ending the Bosnian agony instead of prolonging it . ( Here , especially , NATO  --  not the UN  --  is the preferable mechanism for Western cooperation . ) <p> The bottom line is that if the United States is weak , all roads lead to misfortune : Bosnia will poison the Alliance 's moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ensuring stability ; and NATO enlargement becomes a joke . If the United States remains strong and engaged , it will remain relevant and indispensable : our allies will retain confidence in us ; greater Western European defense cooperation ( within NATO ) might even be useful ; and extending an umbrella over Central Europe becomes a credible as well as a compelling option . Moves that would certainly be harmful in the former context become less harmful in the latter . <p> Thus , the good news is that the fate of the Alliance is in our own hands . If the present flower-child Administration policies continue into a second term , however , or if our troop presence is gutted by Republican congressional deficit-fighters , then all bets are off . That is a formula for the destabilization of Europe . <p> By PETER W.
