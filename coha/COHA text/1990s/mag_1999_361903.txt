Hollywood relationships can be awkward  --  especially when love dies . Years ago at Sony Pictures , manager BRAD GREY set up GARRY SHANDLING 'S upcoming movie What Planet Are You From ? with himself as a producer . But by the time filming started , Shandling was suing Grey for $100 million , claiming that his former manager-producer had cut him out of all kinds of deals . With the trial set to start any minute , the studio faced an expensive hiatus  --  more than $1 million a week  --  while Shandling went to court . Sony , which recently bought part of Grey 's production company , asked its new partner to delay the court date . But Grey declined to be quite that good a sport . As the trial loomed , Shandling settled late last week , with Sony dollars helping to grease the deal . So director MIKE NICHOLS can keep shooting and Grey remains an executive producer with a share in the profit , if there is any . <P>  --  By Kim Masters/Los Angeles       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
