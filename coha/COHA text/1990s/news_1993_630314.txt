<p> While tea drinking is a nearly 5,000-year-old pleasure that began in China , sipping iced tea is a fairly recent American pastime . <p> The story goes that on a hot , humid day in 1904 at the St. Louis World 's Fair , a discouraged vendor was n't having much success selling Indian hot tea . With a scratch of the head and a burst of American inventiveness , he added ice . Within hours , fair-goers were drinking glass after glass of the thirst-quenching iced drink . <p> As a matter of record , the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water is tea . After all , 1 billion-plus Chinese ca n't be wrong . But in the United States , we continue to follow in the footsteps of that inventive vendor : The almost 35 billion glasses of iced tea consumed last year accounted for an astounding 70 to 80 percent of all the tea consumed in America . The predisposition to drinking chilled beverages makes ours the only country in the world where iced tea consumption outweighs that of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of iced tea . The introduction of ready-to-drink ( r-t-d ) teas , which are bottled or canned , is credited with rising sales . Made by companies including Lipton , Tetley , Nestea , Snapple and Ozka , these teas , which eliminate all the fuss of brewing and waiting , come in flavored , sweetened and diet versions . <p> Big ad campaigns and billboards featuring sports stars , fashion models and comedians have paid off . In just two years , r-t-d teas have grown from obscurity to an $ 84.8 million business , according to the Tea Council of the USA . <p> The industry , as one might expect , is thrilled down to its saucers . <p> " The ready-to-drink teas bode well for the industry , " said Joseph Simrany , executive director of the Tea Council . " They appeal to the segment of the market that wants convenience . As new r-t-d tea drinkers acquire a taste for tea , they 're likely to experiment with other forms , like gourmet teas .

In 1992 , iced tea sales alone in grocery stores and restaurants were figured to be about $ 1.28 billion . <p> Besides convenience and flavor , health considerations play a role in tea 's increasing popularity . This all-natural beverage is viewed as a more healthful choice than soft drinks because it 's virtually calorie-free , non-carbonated and contains no artificial additives or colors . The most health-conscious consumers can choose from a large number of herbal blends and decaffeinated varieties on health-food store shelves . <p> " Tea is the wine of the ' 90s , " said Bill Rosenzweig , a partner in The Republic of Tea , a San Francisco company that markets natural gourmet teas through department stores and by catalog . Ros enzweig and partners Mel and Patricia Ziegler ( who were the entrepreneurs behind the innovative Banana Republic clothing store chain ) , believe that people are ready for tea because of the nation 's shift in values and emphasis on healthful living . <p> Many of the company 's teas , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as do those of another California company , Paradise Tropical Tea . Paradise is sold in upscale grocery stores and has introduced such flavors as passion fruit , mango , papaya and kiwi . <p> Iced tea lovers , however , need n't confine themselves to bottled or pre-mixed teas when they want something a little different . Many variations can be concocted at home using ordinary grocery store fruit juices , fruit and spices . <p> Once the tea is brewed and chilled ( see accompanying story ) , there are many ways to dress it up : Use flavored ice cubes that change the flavor of the tea as they melt .
