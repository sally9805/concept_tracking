In the days when he bestrode Washington like a colossus , Newt Gingrich found inspiration in great military leaders of old , from Ataturk to Wellington . Last week , as Gingrich faced one of the lowest points of his rocky speakership , history offered a more cautionary lesson . It was that of a Roman general who became master of the empire , only to find that his own inner circle posed a greater threat than any enemy he had met on the battlefield . Last Tuesday evening , when a handful of conspirators met in the Capitol to plot against their Speaker , Gingrich could not help noticing where they had gathered  --  in a secluded suite of rooms one floor above his , the offices that belong to majority leader Dick Armey . <P> Et tu , Dick ? <P> Gingrich 's current difficulties , while less acute than the ethics investigation that threatened his speakership last winter , are in many ways more intractable , largely because the criticism is coming from within . Republicans say he lacks direction , negotiating skills and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear message that can inspire the faithful . Having come to power preaching revolution , he now presides over an incrementalist institution , holding a paper-thin majority against a popular Democratic President . <P> The Speaker , in an interview , dismissed questions about his political survival as a " media frenzy " over a " road bump , " in this case , the recriminations that followed the G.O.P. 's bungling of a disaster-aid bill . It is true that he appears in little immediate danger : the consequences of unseating the party 's leader seem vastly worse than the damage Gingrich has done , and , more important , Republicans have no obvious replacement . But both his allies and his enemies say this summer 's struggle over shaping the tax bill , the initial versions of which both houses expect to pass with much fanfare this week , may determine whether Gingrich survives the year . " If he blows it , " says an influential G.O.P. strategist close to the leadership , " it is his last shot . He will lose his speakership .

When Armey was asked Tuesday whether he regards Gingrich as an effective leader , the Speaker 's top lieutenant made for the exit , telling reporters ; " Y'all have a good day now . " In subsequent statements , Gingrich and Armey downplayed reports of a rift as misconstrued , but Republican sources say the relationship has become badly and possibly irreparably frayed . <P> That same evening  --  the Speaker 's 54th birthday , as it happened  --  about 35 Republicans , largely drawn from the Gingrich- inspired Class of ' 94 , met in Armey 's suite , ostensibly to talk about upcoming legislation . But their session opened instead with outbursts against Gingrich , some even asserting that it was time to dump him . For the first time , a participant recalled , Gingrich 's fellow Republicans were saying they no longer could trust him .                @ @ @ @ @
