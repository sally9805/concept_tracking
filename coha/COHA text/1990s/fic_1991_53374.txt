WHEN LEETHA PURL LONG married Erbie Hite in Old Ruhama Church , folks said there never was a more mismated pair in the entire county . Their marrying was like an ant joining up with a gadfly , or the dark , still river wedding the fickle Mulberry Creek that ran all over the woods , changing beds after every rain . Leetha Purl took her religion seriously , considering herself a female Nazarite . No wine nor strong drink had ever passed her lips . No scissor nor razor had ever touched the hair bundled against her nape . <p> Through her mother she came of a dark and strange people who had established themselves in the coves long before the Scots-Irish chopped their way into the foothills . Everything about her bespoke these people  --  the deep silence , the big eyes of a neutral color and expression , the muddy skin flushed with copper stretched taut over the high cheekbones and disappearing into the hair dull as lignite . Muscles , primed by hard work , layered her big frame . Her brothers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule died and always leaving the drawing of the well water to her . She had hand-over-fisted the streaming bucket out of the depths of the red clay hill since she was big enough to outweigh it . <p> Erbie was a different matter , gatless as a tomcat but ornamental as a filigreed watch fob with his tune playing and his pretty talk . He blithely took Leetha to live with his Uncle Tipton , not far from the west fork of the river . No matter that Uncle Tipton had n't spoken to Erbie  --  nor hardly anyone else  --  for years . No matter that he lived like a hermit , enforcing his solitude with an ancient double-barreled shotgun kept within easy reach of his front door . <p> " Aw , that thing wo n't even shoot , " Erbie claimed . At any rate , though an unwilling host in the beginning , Tipton soon recognized what a blue-ribbon prize he had in Leetha . The girl could work from can to ca n't and make no fuss about it . She eased the routine flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized hold of his old body , drawing it almost full circle . <p> Gradually the two of them united in focusing their lives on Erbie . They existed that he might be shielded from exertion , provided with food to his liking , and clothes starched and ironed smooth for wearing to the crossroads store . This unspoken partnership shaped their days . As a result Erbie flourished like the biblical green bay tree . Off and on he ranged the countryside cutting firewood for anyone who could pay . Along with the few silver coins , he garnered news and saw sights which he brought back home . The three of them would sit on the front porch-somber Leetha bent over her lap shelling peanuts or peas ; Erbie on the floor slouching against a post , one foot dangling off the edge , harmonica in hand ; the old uncle tilted against the wall in a straight chair , immersed in Erbie 's talk and his tunes , freed for a time from his dimming eyes and aching joints . <p> The sight of them sitting there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should a stone prophet ever pass that way . But only the Widow Gaffney happened by on occasion , and she never raised her eyes from probing the brush , searching out plants for her store of doctoring herbs . So stealthily did she move and with such complete absorption that her small frame was like a gray vapor floating along the ground ; basket gripped in a tough brown hand . <p> Erbie talked without fear of interruption , even when he paused for several minutes to savor a point or dream a bit . He talked about his tobacco patch , the prospects for its harvest and curing . He talked of the pickup with a bed built on the back which he and Tipton would borrow to haul the crop to town . He talked about what he would buy with the money he made from the sale . Sometimes he told about creatures that came out of the deep woods toward the river in the dark of the moon , creatures he had heard lurked about the Widow Gaffney 's cabin giving off a wild musk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its feet uneasily and blow its lips . The widow herself had told him when last he was by her place that even her hound dogs hid in silence when the creatures came about . <p> " She 'll disappear one day , you watch , " he warned , cutting another chew off the quid of tobacco that bulged his hip pocket . " She 's too far back to be alone . A varmit 's bound to get her . " <p> When the three became a quartet at the birth of Rob , the focus of Leetha 's life and the old man 's changed . Rob was a second Erbie , newminted , with hair deep red as galax leaves in the fall of the year , and eyes the lavender blue of chicory blossoms . He laughed like Erbie , his whole face alight , his gold-lashed eyes dancing like the ripples on Mulberry Creek . <p> " Ai n't he a wonder ? " Tipton marveled , watching the boy climb over Leetha in the rocker or tumble about on the floor . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? " <p> Tipton was his only playmate . The two of them darted round Leetha at her work like flashes of illuminated color dancing about a clouded prism . They made up games as they went along . Rob delighted in the unexpected ; when Tipton suddenly imprisoned him in the circle of his knotty arms , Rob struggled and laughed while Tipton exulted , " Leetha 's little red bird . Caught in a bear trap ! " Sometimes Tipton came up behind the boy soundlessly and clasped his hands over Rob 's eyes . Out of his sudden darkness , Rob would exclaim , " Leetha 's little red bird . Gone ! Gone ! " His shouted laugh when Tipton removed his hands , restoring Rob 's world , was echoed by the old man . Other times Tipton seized the boy and held him kicking as high off the floor as his stooped back allowed . " Snared Leetha 's little red bird ! Wo n't let him go till he sings me a song . " Rob would then tilt his bright head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and warble a wordless tune till his breath gave out and Tipton released him . <p> Leetha said nothing , her expression unchanging . But she noted her son 's every movement with the same intent regard she used to have for Erbie , and she tended his every need as possessively . <p> Erbie more often strayed from home on woodcutting trips . When at the cabin , he lounged on the fringe of their group , rarely blowing them a tune . But when he did , Rob forgot even his playmate . The rollicking notes made him squeal , convulsing his body with a delight he could not contain . Tipton laughed so hugely every one of his tobaccostained teeth showed . " Leetha 's little red bird . Dance ! Dance ! " he would chant , clapping his crooked hands . <p> The only thing that pleased Rob more than Erbie 's harp-playing was the bird Tipton brought him the Christmas he turned three . It was life-size , with flecks of silver over the scarlet body and a silver fiber tail inserted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when first I sighted it at the store , " Tipton explained to the cabin in general . " Saw his name on it plain-Rob Hite  --  and nobody else 's . Had to give my jackknife in trade , but a feller who ca n't hardly bend his fingers anyway got no need for a jackknife . " He held the bird before Rob , swinging it from a ribbon threaded through a glass loop in the middle of the fragile back . " Now Leetha 's little red bird has got a bird of his own . " <p> The boy accepted the gift with reverence . From the first he handled it with a touch soft as mullein leaves . He wore it round his neck and sang his wordless tunes to it . And at night , falling asleep in Leetha 's arms , he watched it sway from a nail above the fireplace . Heat waves rising from the fire made the bird turn gently this way and that . " Little red bird . Fly ! Fly ! " Rob murmured . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills with an instant heat that seemed to wither him . He lay in Leetha 's lap without moving , while she rocked and fanned him on the porch . Tipton hovered close , studying the boy anxiously . Erbie , just back from a woods trip , leaned against the post and began to blow a tune of his own making . Rob gave no sign he heard . Tipton seized his bare feet . " I feared sol They 're cold as frog titties ! " His old hands fumbled over the boy 's body , then brushed the auburn hair away from the unresponding face . " But the rest of him 's on fire ! What we going to do ? " <p> " It 's the weather , " Erbie drawled , thumping the harmonica against the heel of his palm . Saliva prickled the dust that coated the floorboards . " If the rains do n't hurry and come , wo n't be no use to set out my tobacco . " <p> As the days passed Rob fought against being held . Leetha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and back doors , hoping to catch a breeze . He rolled about on the pallet , hands working at his throat . Tipton never left him except to bring more water . Leetha bathed Rob 's face and body over and over and held up his resisting head to force small drinks between cracked lips . <p> " He 's like a fired-up cookstove , " Tipton whispered , staring . <p> Erbie dragged the old man away from the house to help him set out and water the tobacco plants . " Ai n't no use setting out tobacco ! Ai n't no use in nothing ! " Tipton cried as Erbie herded him toward the field . <p> Shortly afterwards Leetha came to the tobacco patch and stood until Erbie , crouched in the shade of a persimmon clump watching Tipton bent over a row of wilted plants , acknowledged her . <p> " Rob 's got to have a doctor , " she announced , lifting her chin . <p> Erbie unfolded slowly . He shot a deliberate gob of tobacco spit across the rows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plume of dust rose over it and hung suspended before settling again . <p> " You know there ai n't a doctor for thirty miles , woman . The boy ' 11 be all right soon 's there 's a break in the weather . " <p> " Uncle Tipton . " She had never called him by name before . The old man held a can of water poised over a plant , waiting . " Rob 's got to have help . " <p> For a space of time it seemed he had n't heard . Then he rose , straighter than she 'd ever seen him . He drew back his arm and hurled the can toward the far edge of the field . Then he kicked over the galvanized bucket from which he had been dipping water . Without a glance at Erbie he started toward the house . She followed . <p> At the well he gulped water from the dipper like a mule at the end of a hard day 's plowing . Swiping the back of his hand across his mouth he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch that herbwoman . " Away he hobbled like a three-legged june bug along the path lighted by the sky-high sun . By the time the whippoorwill 's call throbbed in the hollow , Leetha heard his slow step shuffling over the porch , returning . He crumpled into a chair and said above the rasp of the boy 's breathing , " She 's got a granddaughter to look after but promised to come first thing tomorrow . " <p> Leetha and Tipton waited , washing and fanning the boy . He fought , making strangled noises like a thwarted animal . When the Widow Gaffney came she seemed to fill the room . The lamplight magnified her shadow to an enveloping darkness as she leaned over Rob 's pallet , prying open his jaws , inspecting his throat . <p> " Got to have salty grease and a spoon , " she said without turning . From her apron pocket she took a handful of dried leaves . " Got to have hot flannel rags to make a poultice for his throat . " <p> Tipton kindled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron kettle so full of water it spat , hissing , into the flames . The small woman turned on him like a stepped-on hornet . " Get from underfoot ! Menfolks ai n't needed ! " When Leetha brought the grease from the pantry lean-to , she saw him on the porch straining to look inside . <p> For the rest of the day she had no thought of him . While the Widow Gaffney slowly massaged the warm grease down Rob 's throat , Leetha kept hot rags on the herbs that plastered his neck . They worked in silence on opposite sides of the little body . Their dresses stuck to them with sweat . Not till sundown did they take time to eat . By then the child had stopped struggling , though his breathing came harder than ever . <p> " Now I 've done what I could for the lamb , " the herbwoman said , laying him down . " The rest is up to Jesus . " She went to sit on the back step , wiping her face on the grease-splotched apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got to get on home . My granddaughter 's a town girl . She 's not used to staying by herself in the woods . " <p> " Ai n't you afraid some river varmit 'll make off with her ? " Tipton asked , standing in the yard . <p> " It 's not the river vatmits that fret me . " She pinched together the crumbs scattered over her lap and placed them carefully in her looselipped mouth . " It 's the two-legged varmits that make the trouble . " She rose , shaking the wrinkles from her long skirt . <p> " What do I owe you ? " Tipton asked . <p> " I 'll take that red play-purty over the fireplace . " <p> " No , no , " Leetha spoke from the doorway . " That 's Rob 's  --  what he loves best in this world . " <p> The herbwoman gummed the lining of her cheeks and pursed her lips . " Then I 'll take the iron kettle . " <p> Leetha brought it , bending from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the Widow Gaffney . <p> " Much obliged , " Tipton said . <p> " You welcome . " The small woman , tilted from the weight of the kettle , floated off to meet the dark rising like a fog from the hollow . <p> In the cabin , Leetha lighted the lamp . She and Tipton sat on the floor beside the inert child as though brain dumb . Rob 's gasps rose above the night noises that pushed against the cabin from all sides . Darkness slowly slid its feelers deeper and more bindingly into the hollows and over the hills . <p> Footsteps meandered across the porch and Erbie entered the open door yawning . Without glancing at Rob 's attendants he laid his harmonica on the mantel . " No use in everybody staying up , if you ask me . I 'm going to bed . " He kicked a hub of wood onto the red coals that pulsed like a living heart . An explosion of sparks disappeared up the chimney , then the fire quietened again . A still span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both of hers while Tipton stared at the red bird hanging motionless from its nail . The heated silence of the room pressed upon them until Tipton leaped to the door as if summoned . Clutching the jamb he peered outside . Leetha hurried to him . <p> " What is it ? " she hissed . <p> He stepped backward uncertainly , eyes attentive to the dark . " Old Death 's on the prowl tonight . We might as well ready ourselves . " <p> With a panther scream , Leetha slammed the door . She rammed the latch into place and hammered it with her fist . " Rob 's not going ! He 's mine ! Mine ! " <p> Tipton sank in a chair with a sigh that came from the depths of his heart . " Old Death do n't ask nobody 's leave .... " His words trailed away . <p> Leetha scooped the boy in her arms and held him fiercely against her while she rocked . " Not this time , Old Death . Not my Rob ! Not my Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time Rob died , a while after midnight , the words had faded to a whispered plea . <p> Tipton helped her bathe the cooling face and limber body . They dressed him in his Sunday clothes . When he was arranged prim and straight on the pallet , in the light from the kerosene lamp , he did not look like Rob . He looked like a miniature city preacher carved out of yellow wood . Even his bright hair was dimmed . <p> " We got to cover him with something , " Leetha whispered . From high on a shelf she took a folded shawl . After spreading it over him and smoothing every wrinkle she lay down , her arm across him waiting for day to come . The old man crept away from the sound of her tearless croon : " Leetha 's little red bird . Gone . Gone . " <p> Next morning Tipton prodded Erbie awake . " Help me get a box made for Rob . I 'm thinking we 'll use that heart cedar , but we 'll not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trouble busting out on Judgment Day . " <p> Erbie stared around the cabin without understanding . " Lawd Gawd ! I thought the old woman cured him . " <p> Tipton did n't live long after Rob 's burial in the graveyard behind Ruhama Church . " Seems like the lamp 's gone out , " he told Leetha one night as he knotted himself together on the hearthstone . " Ca n't see how to make no sense out o ' living . " Leetha rolled another chunk of wood on the fire  --  a dry , sound piece of hickory she had brought out of the woods herself . Under it she inserted a splinter of pine that blazed into immediate flame illuminating the old man 's matted beard and pus-steeped eyes . <p> " Sometimes when I 'm laying here I hear the wild horses neighing , " he said . " I hear them running , running , down the hill , their hoofs kicking the rocks helter-skelter . " <p> " Where they going ? " <p> " I finally got it figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big cave way back in the woods where the creek makes a Y with the river . That 's where they come from , rampaging through the woods at night and whinnying . " Silence held the room . " My grandpappy spoke of hearing them . They come just on particular nights , he claimed . " Tipton 's eyes rested on the scarlet bird , lightly turning on the end of its ribbon . " I heard ' em that night . " <p> Leetha sat impassive . <p> " If you pay close attention , " his voice quavered , " I 'm of the belief they 'll be running tonight . " <p> She waited till he sank into an unstirring sleep . Then she tucked a coverlet around him before going back to the corner mattress where Erbie snored . <p> In life , the old man had walked far beyond the town , bartering twists of tobacco for the trinkets he arranged on Rob 's grave . From among them Leetha selected a milk-glass egg and a handful of marbles to ornament the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Rob , once they lay side by side in the ground . <p> After that , life was in a state of suspension for Leetha . She seemed to have forgotten how to work . During the long summer , her garden went untended . Peaches ripened on the tree beside the well , but she did not slice them , nor spread them in the sun to dry . She did not store them in airtight jars in the safe to be made into fried pies , tender of crust and sweet of taste , for Erbie 's pleasure . Mostly , she rocked on the porch , in all kinds of weather . <p> But Erbie stayed away from home more and more , two or three days at a time . When he was about the house he never played his harp . He never lifted it from the place on the mantel where he 'd laid it the night Rob died . Even when winter faded and everybody 's need for firewood lessened Erbie could hardly stay home long enough to get his tobacco plants set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't pay enough attention to it to keep the weeds chopped nor the worms picked off the felted leaves . <p> A day come when Leetha realized Erbie had been absent a long time . She stood aimlessly in front of the fireplace , wondering . It was then she noticed the harp missing from the mantelshelf , just above the nail that held Rob 's bird . Where the harp had lain for over a year , there was now only an oblong outline in the dust . Erbie and his harp , together somewhere else . He had no intention of coming back . This certainty flicked in and out of her consciousness like a puff-adder tongue . He would not be coming home . Old Tipton 's question leaped into her mind : " What we going to do ? " <p> With fierce concentration she rethought the months since Rob died , the details vague at first but gradually sharpening . Erbie had come and gone as he pleased . It had not mattered to her . She was wandering through the days and nights like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and then the other , only to turn around and head in yet a different direction . That had not mattered to her either . Now Erbie had taken his harp and run off . <p> She felt like a black bear lumbering out of heavy winter sleep , awakening to life again . Erbie was gone , and she had no idea where . But she knew from what source she could wrest an answer . It took a while to find her Bible . Lately she had spared no time for it . But now she labored through the old tales , finger plodding from word to word , returning now and again to the Psalter as to a refrain . She rocked and she read . A relentless , wordless burning consumed her . As she slowly fingered the fine-printed pages over and over , she felt the answer looming round her like a darkening thunderhead . Sweat oozed from her tense forehead and tightly gripped jaw . With dilated eyes she stared , not at the printed words , not at the blinded , reasonless insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at the light , but into the depths within herself . Out of this darkness she dredged the pieces that locked into one another to make the answer she wanted . <p> A limpness crept through her body . She brushed a languid hand across her eyes , then rose , blew out the lamp , and stood waiting for the dark to lighten . <p> By sunrise she was up and moving with a purpose . Taking Erbie 's loose-headed chop-axe from where it leaned against the well , she tramped to the tobacco patch past Erbie 's plants smothering among the weeds . Straight to the young persimmon trees she went , three coarsely grained black trunks topped by a blended crown of drooping leaves . A few truly aimed whacks brought down the sturdiest . With quick short strokes she trimmed it , savoring the tough , mouth-puckering odor . She hefted it in her hand , then struck the large end against the ground . Trimming the handle a bit more , she tried it again with satisfaction . <p> Once more at the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flour sack she gathered what food she could find in the lean-to 's safe and closed the back door . From off its nail over the fireplace she took the scarlet bird . Cradling it in her hand , she shut the front door behind her , picked up the persimmon club , and set out on the path downhill . At the logging road , without hesitation , she turned right to the Ruhama churchyard . Singling out Rob 's grave , she knelt and placed the bird at the head of it , looping the ribbon about the sandstone marker . <p> " I might ' a known I could n't keep you , " she whispered . <p> Back to the logging road , she paced off the miles to the crossroads . Talk in the shadowed store stopped sudden as an indrawn breath when she strode out of the morning glare . The storekeeper , leaning on the candy counter scrubbing his teeth with a sweetgum brush , blinked at her . <p> " Hidy , Miz Hite . " <p> " My man been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listening , as if to give them the opportunity to answer . Everyone looked carefully away . <p> " Well , let 's see , " he finally said . " Not lately . Yes . I would say not lately . " <p> She turned toward the door . <p> " Snakes sure must be bad out your way , from the looks of that club . Seen any today ? " the storekeeper said . <p> Closing the screen door soundlessly , she walked away . At the Widow Gaffney 's cabin she found the old woman hoeing her Irish potatoes . Leetha stood in the dust till the widow sighted her . Though her wrinkled face quivered , the old woman said nothing . <p> " Your girl home ? " Leetha asked . <p> " Not right this minute . " <p> " Where she gone ? " <p> " More'n likely to her mammy 's across the county line . She 'll be sending me word any day now . " <p> " When did she go ? " Leetha pressed her . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her voice wavered like an echo in the bottom of a dry well . <p> Leetha went first to the sawmill shack beyond the cut-over pine woods . She found it leaning behind mildewed humps of sawdust , windows empty , front door hanging by one hinge . A yellow-striped lizard sunning on the porch told her plain as words that nobody was anywhere near . <p> Next she sought the abandoned coal mine . Years back a cave-in of ceiling timbers had shut off its passages . Dirt daubers had built row after row of long-fingered mud houses on the grayed timbers . Underneath , the dust showed no footprints . <p> In the shady hollow below the mine she paused to drink at a spring . The persimmon club slipped to the ground while She slapped water over her face , washing away the sweat and heat . As she rose and dried with the flour sack , her eyes followed the water flowing from the spring . Not far down the slope , it trickled into the branch . The branch wound through the fern and seven-bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulberry frolicked and danced into the hills , finally flowing into the river . <p> The river . <p> She had never seen it , but Erbie 's stories crowded out of her memory . From the river , bobcats came on the prowl for meat . Those other nameless creatures , more fearful than bobcats , crept from there after dark and roamed the settlements . From the river Old Tipton had said the wild horses galloped on the rampage  --  from a cave where the creek joined the river . Looking in that direction , she felt a calm certainty possess her . That way she should go . <p> Taking a fresh grip on the club , she set out along the branch . By nightfall she had reached the place where the Mulberry settled down within age-old banks . It widened and deepened so that she skirted it with care , sensing its wine-colored waters concealed dangers she could put no words to . Soon now , she knew , the creek would slide into the river . <p> After eating the last of the food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees drawn up to her chest , she covered herself with the flour sack , a flimsy shield against the damp . <p> Next day , as she picked her way through the brush , the morning wind wafted a slight fog of wood smoke toward her . She stopped , waiting till the bay leaves stilled . Over and under the fern and laurel there wove a light melody . <p> A harp . <p> Erbie 's harp . <p> The tune verved to an end ; it was echoed by a girl 's laugh and a little squeal . Erbie 's lazy laughter drawled through the woods . Leetha eased out where she could see the wooded rise that , rock by gray rock , piled itself skyward from the river 's edge . Partway up crouched the dark blot of the cave , mottled by sunlit leaves and pink laurel blossoms . <p> She took her time finding the way along the slope . Once she stopped to wipe her sweating hands on the flour sack . Then she dried the handle of the persimmon club by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club against her hard grip , as if unscrewing a tightly sealed jar . <p> On the lip of the cave mouth a coffee pot squatted in the coals of a dying fire . Scattered around were crumpled papers , sardine cans , and empty bottles . <p> They did not hear her come . The girl was seated on a quilt spread on the cave floor , a comb poised in her hand . Beside her knelt Erbie , his face buried in her long hair . Next to his knee lay the harmonica . A vagrant sunray struck silver from its polished side . <p> He did not know Leetha stood watching until the girl cried out and stiffened away from him . He raised his face to see her , stricken gray as an old bone , staring over his shoulder . His head snapped round . <p> " Leetha ! " He leaped to his bare feet . <p> Without a word she strode past him . Raising the club with both hands , she brought it down with all her strength . The girl made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never spoken . Blood ensnared her smooth-combed hair , straggling it across the soft Pace and rounded white shoulders . <p> Leetha hit her but once . Dropping the club , she stepped back to wipe her hands on the flour sack . Erbie watched from outside the entrance . <p> " Let 's go home , " she said , tossing the sack to the ground . <p> The raucous call of the rain crow dogged their steps as he led the way back , When they broke out of the woods within far sight of their cabin the sun had paled , Thunder rumbled behind the hills . <p> " Seems like it might rain , " Erbie said , appraising the sky . " First thing tomorrow I got to get my tobacco hoed . " <p> <p> By AILEEN KILGORE HENDERSON <p>
