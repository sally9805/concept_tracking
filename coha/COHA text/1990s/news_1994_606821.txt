<p> Imagine an empty stocking , nothing under the tree and no other gift but this : From the first time you open your mouth on Christmas morning , the sound that comes out is your voice fully realized  --  rich , fluid and beautiful . It soars and dives , it softens and swells . <p> Imagine that you can really sing . <p> ' T is the season of the voice box , the holiday when singing becomes a national pastime in malls and family rooms , on street corners and in office-building lobbies . But what of those who gave up singing long ago ? And those who do n't have time for it or do n't dare let anyone hear what might come out of them ? Is something missing in a life without song ? <p> Music-making is " the thing that connects us most powerfully to our emotions , our fellow people and to the natural world , " said Charles Keil , a professor of American studies at State University of New York in Buffalo . Singing is " the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colds and flus and stress and merrymaking , how can you find your voice  --  especially if you only sing on holidays ? <p> Pitch and Practice <p> Of the elements that make up a person 's musical ability , among the most important is pitch . According to physics , pitch is the frequency of sound waves , the speed of vibrations . Low notes are slow vibrators ; high notes , fast . <p> Babies respond to pitch . They quickly learn to respond to a mother 's tone of voice long before they make sense of her words . " When talking to infants , human mothers use vocal patterns that are unusual by the standards of normal conversation , " said Anne Fernald , a developmental psychologist at Stanford University . " Mothers , as well as fathers and adults who are not parents , speak consistently more slowly and with higher pitch when interacting with infants . " <p> In short , babies have good pitch sense . But by the time they become adults , many of them believe that they do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perceived in two ways . One is the simple lowness or highness of a tone . The other is as a note on the scale : B-flat , C-sharp or whatever . Although there are exceptions , most people have no trouble distinguishing low from high . As Diana Deutsch , a professor of psychology at the University of California-San Diego , explained , real tone-deafness is n't very common . People who call themselves " tone-deaf " are often people who just have n't learned how to carry a tune . <p> No one would expect to just pick up a bassoon and be able to play it right away . But many people avoid singing because their early attempts flopped . Of course it 's swell to be naturally gifted , but a little practice can do wonders too . " There are some people who are just born " able to easily distinguish pitch , said Luann Dragone , who teaches ear training at Columbia University . Then again , " there are some people who do n't have much of it , but they develop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singers on Great Singing , " operatic baritone Sherrill Milnes told author Jerome Hines : " The idea that you either have a voice , or you do n't ... that you ca n't learn how to make a great sound ... to a large extent is erroneous . " <p> For once-a-year carolers , getting up to speed may be the problem . " You 've got to practice this skill like an instrument . You have got to have it be a daily practice , " said Dragone . <p> At the other end of the spectrum are those gifted with absolute pitch , commonly called perfect pitch . There is wide variation of perfect pitch among people who have it . Generally it means that people can hear notes and name them  --  B-flat , G  --  without striking the note on the piano or referring to a pitch pipe . <p> Little is known about the phenomenon of perfect pitch , but heredity seems to play a role . Deutsch pointed out that in some families , one child may have it while the others do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , heredity is not the whole story . <p> " Many people believe that absolute pitch is acquired during early childhood during a critical period , " said Deutsch , noting that the trait seems to be particularly common among the Japanese , who typically begin musical training in early childhood . <p> But Deutsch also said her research indicates that most people , whether musical or not , have an inner orientation to pitch , a subconscious " template " of pitch and range " that you acquire mentally in the same way you acquire accent . " <p> Pavarotti and Prevention <p> All this means you may have more singing talent than you realize . <p> But when the festivities begin , your biggest problem might not be pitch but being able to use your voice at all . Once-a-year singers , like weekend athletes , should n't be surprised if those couch potato vocal cords are wiped out after a block or two of carols . And as the temperatures chill out and the cold and flu viruses get to work , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , the pros have a few tricks to pass on to weekend warblers . <p> Pavarotti , for instance , has said that the essential thing for him is to not let his feet get cold . <p> Rock singer Alan MacEwen of the Grandsons of the Pioneers treats his voice with tough love . " Hot drinks tend to get me through , " he said . " Other than that , I just try to tough it out and do the best I can . " He counts himself pretty lucky and said there have only been a couple of times when he could n't sing because of illness . <p> Baritone Gordon Hawkins said he tries to keep his busy life as normal as possible . Born in D.C. and raised in Clinton , Hawkins recently sang " Aida " in Seville . He is studying to perform " Rigoletto " in the spring in Seattle and is also making a recording of " Porgy and Bess " with the Dallas Symphony . " The best medicine is preventive , " he advised . " You try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle at both ends . You try to be as normal as possible . " <p> He has never had to cancel a performance and said that some of his best performances took place when he was feeling under the weather . That 's because " you have to concentrate on everything , " he said . <p> So maybe feeling a little sniffly and stuffed-up the next time you belt out " Rudolph , the Red-Nosed Reindeer " at your neighbor 's house is a good thing . In fact , Hawkins sometimes enjoys singing with a cold . <p> " The first couple days are great . You 're lubricated and your sinuses are draining and pockets of resonance you do n't normally have open up . " <p> But as a cold persists , the sinuses get blocked up . " You feel as if you 're singing into a pillow , " he said . <p> The main prescription for taking care of the singing voice is a healthful lifestyle . This includes plenty of rest , a precious commodity in the fast pace of the holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Opera , the Wolf Trap Opera and the Metropolitan Opera of New York . That 's in his off hours . During the day , he works at Walter Reed Army Medical Center as an industrial hygienist technician . <p> " Last year when I did the opera " Goetterdaemmerung " in New York , I 'd work half a day , drive to New York , do the performance , get home at 4 in the morning and go to work the next day . " He just concentrates on the basics . " I try to eat well and get plenty of rest . I try not to abuse my voice . Most of the problems are due to not getting enough rest . " <p> Yvette Lewis of Silver Spring watches her diet and gets lots of exercise . " I exercise at least four times a week . I work out with weights , " said the soprano , who designed a program called " So This Is Opera , " which she performs in local schools . " I cut the fat in my diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep postnasal drip thinned out . " <p> Lewis avoids places where she 'd be exposed to smoke . If she gets a cold in her head or chest , she keeps singing . Unless " it 's on the cords . " Then " I cancel , " she said . <p> Ballads of the Policy Wonks <p> Just about everybody can sing this season . Only a problem with your vocal cords should keep you from the caroling crowds . As for singing in tune , remember that you probably have a sense of pitch stored in your subconscious . It 's just a matter of a little practice . <p> In times past , people often sang while they worked . Thus among the many folk song collections on the public library shelves , you find such books as " The Songs of the Cowboys " and " Songs the Whalemen Sang . " <p> What you wo n't find at the library is " Songs of the GS-5s " or " Songs the Computer Technicians Sang , " much less " Ballads of the Policy Wonks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scythe  --  but not when you 're trying to type the boss 's memo . Without such daily occasions for singing , the holiday season becomes the prime time for participating in music . <p> " When people are singing , there 's a real common denominator of experience , " said Marion Lindblad-Goldberg , a psychologist at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Center . " Whatever differences exist  --  of culture , of gender , of whatever  --  are eliminated by using a language that is not words . Singing with other people , you develop a feeling of community , of being a part of a whole . <p>
