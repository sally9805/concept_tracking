NEWTON // Antes // " No matter where you go , there you are . " //  --  From a plaque on the starship Excelsior , in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country , presumably borrowed from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai // You are at the helm of the starship Defiant ( NCC-1764 ) , currently in orbit around the planet Iconia , near the Neutral Zone . Your mission : to rendezvous with a nearby supply vessel at the other end of this solar system in order to pick up components to repair faulty transporter primary energizing coils , There is no need to achieve warp speeds ; you direct the impulse drive to be set at full power for leisurely half-light-speed travel , which should bring you to your destination in a few hours , giving you time to bring the captain 's log up to date . However , as you begin to pull out of orbit , you feel an intense pressure in your chest . Your hands are leaden , and you are glued to your seat . Your mouth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are about to burst out of their sockers , and the blood flowing through your body refuses to rise to your head . Slowly , you lose consciousness . . . and within minutes you die . // What happened ? It is not the first signs of spatial " interphase " drift , which will later overwhelm the ship , or an attack from a previously cloaked Romulan vessel . Rather , you have fallen prey to something far more powerful . The ingenious writers of Star Trek , on whom you depend , have not yet invented inertial dampers , which they will introduce sometime later in the series . You have been defeated by nothing more exotic than Isaac Newton 's laws of motion  --  the very first things one can forget about high school physics . // OK , I know some trekkers out there are saying to themselves , " How lame ! Do n't give me Newton . Tell me things I really want to know , like How does warp drive work ? ' or What is the flash before going to warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or What is a dilithium crystal anyway ? ' " All I can say is that we will get there eventually . Travel in the Star Trek universe involves some of the most exotic concepts in physics , But many different aspects come together before we can really address everyone 's most fundamental question about Star Trek ; " Is any of this really possible , and if so , how ? " // To go where no one has gone before  --  indeed , before we even get out of Starfleet Headquarters  --  we first have to confront the same peculiarities that Galileo and Newton did over three hundred years ago . The ultimate motivation will be the truly cosmic question which was at the heart of Gene Roddenberry 's vision of Star Trek and which , to me , makes this whole subject worth thinking about : " What does modern science allow us to imagine about our possible future as a civilization ? " // Anyone who has ever been in an airplane or a fast car knows the feeling of being pushed back into the scat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vengeance aboard a starship . The fusion reactions in the impulse drive produce huge pressures , which push gases and radiation backward away from the ship at high velocity . It is the backreaction force on the engines  --  from the escaping gas and radiation  --  that causes the engines to " recoil " forward . The ship , being anchored to the engines , also recoils forward . At the helm , you are pushed forward too , by the force of the captain 's seat on your body . In turn , your body pushes back on the seat . // Now , here 's the catch . Just as a hammer driven at high velocity toward your head will produce a force on your skull which can easily be lethal , the captain 's seat will kill you if the force it applies to you is too great . Jet pilots and NASA have a name for the force exerted on your body while you undergo high accelerations ( as in a plane or during a space launch ) : G-forces . I can describe these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at my computer terminal busily typing , I feel the ever-present pressure of my office chair on my buttocks  --  a pressure that I have learned to live with ( yet , I might add , that my buttocks are slowly reacting to in a very noncosmetic way ) . The force on my buttocks results from the pull of gravity , which if given free rein would accelerate me downward into the Earth . What stops me from accelerating  --  indeed , from moving beyond my seat  --  is the ground exerting an opposite upward force on my house 's concrete and steel frame , which exerts an upward force on the wood floor of my second-floor study , which exerts a force on my chair , which in turn exerts a force on the part of my body in contact with it . If the Earth were twice as massive but had the same diameter , the pressure on my buttocks would be twice as great . The upward forces would have to compensate for the force of gravity by being twice as strong . // The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are in the captain 's seat and you issue a command for the ship to accelerate , you must take into account the force with which the seat will push you forward . if you request an acceleration twice as great , the force on you from the seat will be twice as great . The greater the acceleration , the greater the push . The only problem is that nothing can withstand the kind of force needed to accelerate to impulse speed quickly  --  certainly not your body . // By the way , this same problem crops up in different contexts throughout Star Trek  --  even on Earth . At the beginning of Star Trek V : The Final Frontier , James Kirk is free-climbing while on vacation in Yosemite when he slips and falls . Spock , who has on his rocket boots , speeds to the rescue , aborting the captain 's fall within a foot or two of the ground . Unfortunately , this is a case where the solution can be as bad as the problem . It is the process of stopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , whether or not it is the ground that does the stopping or Spock 's Vulcan grip . // Well before the reaction forces that will physically tear or break your body occur , other severe physiological problems set in . First and foremost , it becomes impossible for your heart to pump strongly enough to force the blood up to your head . This is why fighter pilots sometimes black out when they perform maneuvers involving rapid acceleration . Special suits have been created to force the blood up from pilots ' legs to keep them conscious during acceleration . This physiological reaction remains one of the limiting factors in determining how fist the acceleration of present-day spacecraft can be , and it is why NASA , unlike Jules Verne in his classic From the Earth to the Moon , has never launched three men into orbit from a giant cannon . // If I want to accelerate from rest to , say , 150,000 km/sec , or about half the speed of light , I have to do it gradually , so that my body will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pushed back into my seat with a force greater than 3G , my acceleration must be no more than three times the downward acceleration of falling objects on Earth . At this rate of acceleration , it would take some 5 million seconds , or about 2 1/2 months , to reach half light speed ! This would not make for an exciting episode . // To resolve this dilemma , sometime after the production of the first Constitution Class starship  --  the Enterprise ( NCC-1701 )  --  the Star Trek writers had to develop a response to the criticism that the accelerations aboard a starship would instantly turn the crew into " chunky salsa , " They came up with " inertial dampers , " a kind of cosmic , shock absorber and an ingenious plot device designed to get around this sticky tittle problem . // The inertial dampers are most notable in their absence . For example , the Enterprise was nearly destroyed after losing control of the inertial dampers when the microchip life-forms known as Nanites , as part of their evolutionary process , started munching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost every time the Enterprise is destroyed ( usually in some renegade timeline ) , the destruction is preceded by loss of the inertial dampers . The results of a similar loss of control in a Romulan Warbird provided us with an explicit demonstration that Romulans bleed green . // Alas , as with much of the technology in the Star Trek universe , it is much easier to describe the problem the inertial dampers address than it is to explain exactly how they might do it , The First Law of Star Trek physics surely must state that the more basic the problem to be circumvented , the more challenging the required solution must be . For the reason we have come this far , and the reason we can even postulate a Star Trek future , is that physics is a field that builds on itself . A Star Trek fix must circumvent not merely some problem in physics but every bit of physical knowledge that has been built upon this problem . Physics progresses not by revolutions , which do away with all that went before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already understood , Newton 's laws will continue to be as true a million years from now as they are today , no matter what we discover at the frontiers of science . If we drop a ball on Earth , it will always fall . If I sit at this desk and write from here to eternity , my buttocks will always suffer the same consequences . // Be that as it may , it would be unfair simply to leave the inertial dampers hanging without at least some concrete description of how they would have to operate . From what I have argued , they must create an artificial world inside a starship in which the reaction force that responds to the accelerating force is canceled . The objects inside the ship are " tricked " into acting as though they were not accelerating . I have described how accelerating gives you the same feeling as being pulled at by gravity . This connection , which was the basis of Einstein 's general theory of relativity , is much more intimate than it may at first seem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these gadgets : they must set up an artificial gravitational field inside the ship which " pulls " in the opposite direction to the reaction force , thereby canceling it out . // Even if you buy such a possibility , other practical issues must be dealt with . For one thing , it takes some time for the inertial dampers to kick in when unexpected impulses arise . For example , when the Enterprise was bumped into a causality loop by the Bozeman as the latter vessel emerged from a temporal distortion , the crew was thrown all about the bridge ( even before the breach in the warp core and the failure of the dampers ) . I have read in the Enterprise 's technical specifications that the response time for the inertial dampers is about 60 milliseconds . Short as this may seem , it would be long enough to kill you if the same delay occurred during programmed periods of acceleration . To convince yourself , think how long it takes for a hammer to smash your head open , or how long it takes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling off of a cliff in Yosemite . Just remember that a collision at 10 miles per hour is equivalent to running full speed into a brick wall ! The inertial dampers had better be pretty quick to respond . More than one trekker I know has remarked that whenever the ship is buffeted , no one ever gets thrown more than a few feet . // Before leaving the familiar world of classical physics , I ca n't help mentioning another technological marvel that must confront Newton 's laws in order to operate : the Enterprise 's tractor beam  --  highlighted in the rescue of the Genome colony on Moab IV , when it deflected an approaching stellar core fragment , and in a similar ( but failed ) attempt to save Bre'el IV by pushing an asteroidal moon back into its orbit . On the face of it , the tractor beam seems simple enough  --  more or less like an invisible rope or rod  --  even if the force exerted may be exotic . Indeed , just like a strong rope , the tractor beam often does a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ship , or inhibiting the escape of an enemy spacecraft . The only problem is that when we pull something with a rope , we must be anchored to the ground or to something else heavy . Anyone who has ever been skating knows what happens if you are on the ice and you try to push someone away from you . You do manage to separate , but at your own expense . Without any firm grounding , you are a helpless victim of your own inertia . // It was this very principle that prompted Captain Jean-Luc Picard to order Lieutenant Riker to turn off the tractor beam in the episode " The Battle " ; Picard pointed out that the ship they were towing would be carried along beside them by its own momentum  --  its inertia . By the same token , if the Enterprise were to attempt to use the tractor beam to ward off the Stargazer , the resulting force would push the Enterprise backward as effectively as it would push the Stargazer forward . // This phenomenon has already dramatically affected the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , that you are an astronaut assigned to tighten a bolt on the Hubble Space Telescope . If you take an electric screwdriver with you to do the job , you are in for a rude awakening after you drift over to the offending bolt . When you switch on the screwdriver as it is pressed against the bolt , you are as likely to start spinning around as the bolt is to turn . This is because the Hubble Telescope is a lot heavier than you are . When the screwdriver applies a force to the bolt , the reaction force you feel may more easily turn you than the bolt , especially if the bolt is still fairly tightly secured to the frame . Of course , if you are lucky enough , like the assassins of Chancellor Gorkon , to have gravity boots that secure you snugly to whatever you are standing on , then you can move about as efficiently as we are used to on Earth . // Likewise , you can see what will happen if the Enterprise tries to pull another spacecraft toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will move toward the other object when the tractor beam turns on , rather than vice versa . In the depths of space , this distinction is a meaningless semantic one . With no reference planet like Moab IV in the path of a renegade star , it makes a great deal of difference whether the Enterprise pushes the star aside or the star pushes the Enterprise aside ! // One trekker I know claims that the way around this problem is already stated indirectly in at least one episode : if the Enterprise were to use its impulse engines at the same time that it turned its tractor beam on , it could , by applying an opposing force with its own engines , compensate for any recoil it might feel when it pushed or pulled on something . This trekker claims that somewhere it is stated that the tractor beam requires the impulse drive to be operational in order to work . I , however , have never noticed any instructions from Kirk or Picard to turn on the impulse engines at the same time the tractor beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of designing and building inertial dampers , I do n't think such a brute force solution would be necessary . Reminded of Geordi LaForge 's need for a warp field to attempt to push back the moon at Bre'el IV , I think a careful , if presently unattainable , manipulation of space and time would do the trick equally well . To understand why , we need to engage the inertial dampers and accelerate to the modern world of curved space and time .
