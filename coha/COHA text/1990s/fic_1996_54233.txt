To say that I have been haunted for the rest of my life by the affair Finnegan , is to grossly understate the events leading up to that final melancholy . Only now at three score and ten can I write these words for an astonished constabulary who may well run with picks and shovels to unearth my truths or bury my lies . <p> The facts are these : <p> Three children went astray and were missed . Their bodies were found in the midst of Chatham Forest and each bore no marks of criminal assassination , but all had suffered their life blood to be drained . Only their skin remained like that of some discolored vineyard grapes withered by sunlight and no rain . <p> From the withered detritus of these innocents rose fresh rumors of vampires or similar beasts with similar appetites . Such myths always pursue the facts to stun them in their tracks . It could only have been a tombyard beast , it was said , that fed on and destroyed three lives and mined three dozen more . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , Sir Robert Merriweather , pretender to the throne of Sherlock Holmes but modestly refusing the claim , moved through the ten dozen doors of his antique house to come forth to search for this terrible thief of life . With myself , I might add , to carry his brandy and bumbershoot and warn him of underbrush pitfalls in that dark and mysterious forest . <p> Sir Robert Merriweather ? you say . <p> Just that . Plus the ten times ten plus twelve amazing doors in his shut-up house . <p> Were the doors used ? Not one in nine . How had they appeared in Sir Robert 's old manse ? He had shipped them in , as a collector of doors , from Rio , Paris , Rome , Tokyo and mid-America . Once collected , he had stashed them , hinged , to be seen from both sides , on the walls of his upper and lower chambers . There he conducted tours of these odd portals for such antique fools as were ravished by the sight of the curiously overdone , the undersimplified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon 's nephews , or seized from Hermann Goering who had in turn ransacked the Louvre . Others , pelted by Oklahoma dust storms , were jostled home in flatbeds cushioned by bright posters from carnivals buried in the wind-blown desolations of 1936 America . Name your least favorite door , it was his . Name the best quality , he owned it also , hidden and safe , true beauties behind oblivion 's portals . <p> I had come to see his doors , not the deaths . At his behest , that were commands , I had bought my curiosity a steamship ticket and arrived to find Sir Robert involved not with ten dozen doors , but some great dark door . A mysterious portal , still un-found . And beneath ? A tomb . <p> Sir Robert hurried the grand tour , opening and shutting panels rescued from Peking , long buried near Etna , or filched from Nantucket . But his heart , gone sick , was not in this what should have been delightful tour . <p> He described the spring rains that drenched the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk out in that fine weather and one week find the body of a boy emptied of life through two incisions in his neck , and in the next weeks , the bodies of the two girls . People shouted for the police and sat drinking in pubs , their faces long and pale , while mothers locked their children home where fathers lectured on the dooms that lay in Chatham Forest . <p> " Will you come with me , " said Sir Robert at last , " on a very strange sad picnic ? " <p> " I will , " I said . <p> So we snapped ourselves in weather-proofs , lugged a hamper of sandwiches and red wine and plunged into the forest on a drear Sunday . <p> There was time as we moved down a hill into the dripping gloom of the trees , to recall what the papers had said about the vanished children 's bloodless flesh , the police thrashing the forest ten dozen times , clueless , while the surrounding estates slammed their doors drum-tight at sunset . <p> " Rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face stared up , his gray mustache quivering over his thin mouth . He was sick and brittle and old . " Our picnic will be ruined ! " <p> " Picnic ? " I said . " Will our killer join us for eats ? " <p> " I pray to God he will , " Sir Robert said . " Yes , pray to God he will . " <p> We walked through a land that was now mists , now dim sunlight , now forest , now open glade , until we came into a silent part of the woods , a silence made of the way the trees grew wetly together and the way the green moss lay , in swards and hillocks . Spring had not yet filled the empty trees . The sun was like an arctic disc , withdrawn , cold and almost dead . <p> " This is the place , " said Sir Robert at last . <p> " Where the children were found ? " I inquired . <p> " ' Their bodies empty as empty can be . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the people who had stood over them with startled faces and the police who had come to whisper and touch and go away , lost . <p> " The murderer was never apprehended ? " <p> " Not this clever fellow . How observant are you. ? " asked Sir Robert . <p> " What do you want observed ? " <p> " There 's the catch . The police slipped up . They were stupidly anthropomorphic about the whole bloody mess , seeking a killer with two arms , two legs , a suit of clothes and a knife . So hypnotized with their human concept of the killer that they overlooked one obvious unbelievable fact about this place . So ! " <p> He gave his cane a quick light tap on the earth . <p> Something happened . I stared at the ground . " Do that again , " I whispered . <p> " You saw it ? " <p> " I thought I saw a small trap door open and shut . May I have your cane ? " <p> He gave me the cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " A spider ! " I cried . " Gone ! God , how quick ! " <p> " Finnegan , " Sir Robert muttered . <p> " What ? " <p> " You know the old saying : in again , out again , Finnegan . Here . " <p> With his pen-knife , Sir Robert dug in the soil to lift an entire clod of earth , breaking off bits to show me the tunnel . The spider , in panic , leaped out its small wafer door and fell to the ground . <p> Sir Robert handed me the tunnel . " Like gray velvet . Feel . A model builder that small chap . A tiny shelter , camouflaged , and him alert . He could hear a fly walk . Then pounce out , seize , pop back , slam the lid ! " <p> " I did n't know you loved Nature . " <p> " Loathe it . But this wee chap , there 's much we share . Doors . Hinges . Would n't consider other arachnids . But my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir Robert worked the trap on its cob-web hinges . " What craftsmanship ! And it all ties to the tragedies ! " <p> " The murdered children ? " <p> Sir Robert nodded . " Notice any special thing about this forest ? " <p> " It 's too quiet . " <p> " Quiet ! " Sir Robert smiled weakly . " Vast quantities of silence . No familiar birds , beetles , crickets , toads . Not a rustle or stir . The police did n't notice . Why should they ? But it was this absence of sound and motion in the glade that prompted my wild theory about the murders . " <p> He toyed with the amazing structure in his hands . <p> " What would you say if you could imagine a spider large enough , in a hideout big enough , so that a running child might hear a vacuumed sound , be seized , and vanish with a soft thud below . How say you ? " Sir Robert stared at the trees . " Poppycock and bilge ? Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  pfft ! " <p> Again he tapped with his cane . A trap door flew open , shut . " Finnegan , " he said . <p> The sky darkened . <p> " Rain ! " Casting a cold gray eye at the clouds , he stretched his frail hand to touch the showers . " Damn ! Arachnids hate rain . And so will our huge dark Finnegan . " <p> " Finnegan ! " I cried , irritably . <p> " I believe in him , yes . " <p> " A spider larger than a child ? ! " <p> " Twice as large ! " <p> The cold wind blew a mizzle of rain over us . " Lord , I hate to leave . Quick , before we go . Here . " <p> Sir Robert raked away the old leaves with his cane , revealing two globular gray-brown objects . <p> " What are they ? " I bent . " Old cannonballs ? " <p> " No . " He cracked the grayish globes . " Soil , through and through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our Finnegan excavates , " said Sir Robert . " To make his tunnel . With his large rake-like chelicerae he dislodges soils , works it into a ball , carries it in his jaws and drops it beyond his hole . " <p> Sir Robert displayed half a dozen pellets on his trembling palm . " Normal balls evicted from a tiny trap door tunnel . Toy size . " He knocked his cane on the huge globes at our feet . " Explain those ! " <p> I laughed . " The children must 've made them with mud ! " <p> " Nonsense ! " cried Sir Robert irritably , glaring about at trees and earth . " By God , somewhere , our dark beast lurks beneath his velvet lid . We might be standing on it . Christ , do n't stare ! His door has beveled rims . Some architect , this Finnegan . A genius at camouflage . " <p> Sir Robert raved on and on , describing the dark earth , the arachnid , its fiddling legs , its hungry mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , Sir Robert flung up his cane . <p> " No ! " he cried . <p> I had no time to turn . My flesh froze , my heart stopped . <p> Something snatched my spine . <p> I thought I heard a huge bottle uncorked , a lid sprung . Then this monstrous thing crawled down my back . <p> " Here ! " cried Sir Robert . " Now ! " <p> He struck with his cane . I fell , dead weight . He thrust the thing from my spine . He lifted it . <p> The wind had cracked the dead tree branch and knocked it on my back . <p> Weakly , I tried to rise , shivering . " Silly , " I said , a dozen times . " Silly . Damn awful silly ! " <p> " Silly , no . Brandy , yes ! " said Sir Robert . " Brandy ? " <p> The sky was very black now . The rain swarmed over us . <p> Door after door after door , and at last into Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire smoldered on a drafty hearth . We devoured our sandwiches , waiting for the rain to cease . Sir Robert estimated that it would stop by eight o'clock when , by moonlight , we might return , ever so reluctantly , to Chatham Forest . I remembered the fallen branch , its spidering touch , and drank both wine and brandy . <p> " The silence in the forest , " said Sir Robert , finishing his meal . " What murderer could achieve such a silence ? " <p> " An insanely clever man with a series of baited , poisoned traps , with liberal quantities of insecticide , might kill off every bird , every rabbit , every insect , " I said . <p> " Why should he do that ? " <p> " To convince us that there is a large spider nearby . To perfect his act . " <p> " We are the only ones who have noticed this silence , the police did not . Why should a murderer go to all that trouble for nothing ? " <p> " Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not convinced . " Sir Robert topped his food with wine . " This creature , with a voracious mouth , has cleansed the forest . With nothing left , he seized the children . The Silence , the murders , the prevalence of trap door spiders , the large earth balls , it all fits . " <p> Sir Robert 's fingers crawled about the desk top , quite like a washed , manicured spider in itself . He made a cup of his frail hands , held them up . <p> " At the bottom of a spider 's burrow is a dust-bin into which drop insect remnants which the spider has dined . Imagine the dust-bin of our Grand Finnegan ! " <p> I imagined . I visioned a Great Legged thing fastened to its dark lid under the forest and a child running , singing in the half light . A brisk insucked whisk of air , the song cut short , then nothing but an empty glade and the echo of a softly dropped lid , and beneath the dark earth the spider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its silently orchestrating legs . <p> What could the dust-bin of such an incredible spider resemble ? What the remnants of many banquets ? I shuddered . <p> " Rain 's letting up . " Sir Robert nodded his approval . " Back to the forest . I 've mapped the damned place for weeks . All the bodies were found in one half-open glade . That 's where the assassin , if it was a man , arrives ! Or where the unnatural silk-spinning , earth tunneling , architect of special doors , abides his tomb . " <p> " Must I hear all this ? " I protested . <p> " Listen more . " Sir Robert downed the last of his burgundy . " The poor children 's prolapsed corpses were found at thirteen day intervals . Which means that every two weeks our loathsome eight-legged hide and seeker must feed . Tonight is the 14th night after the last child was found , nothing but skin . Tonight our hidden friend must hunger afresh . So ! Within the hour , I shall introduce you to Finnegan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , " I said , " makes me want to drink . " <p> " Here I go . " Sir Robert stepped through one of his Louis the Fourteenth portals . " To find the last and final and most awful door in all my life . You will follow . " <p> Damn , yes ! I followed . <p> The sun had set , the rain was gone and the clouds cleared off to show a cold and troubled moon . We moved in our own silence and the silence of the exhausted paths and glades while Sir Robert handed me a small silver pistol . <p> " Not that that would help . Killing an outsize arachnid is sticky . Hard to know where to fire the first shot . If you miss there 'll be no time for a second . Damned things , large or small , move in the instant ! " <p> " Thanks . " I took the weapon . ' I need a drink . " . <p> " Done . " Sir Robert handed me a silver brandy flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What about you ? " <p> " I have my own special flask . " Sir Robert lifted it . " For the right time . " <p> " Why wait ? " <p> " I must surprise the beast and must n't be drunk at the encounter . Four seconds before the thing grabs me , I will imbibe of this dear Napoleon stuff , spiced with a rude surprise . " <p> " Surprise ? " <p> " Ah , wait . You 'll see . So will this dark thief of life . Now , dear sir , here we part company . I this way , you yonder . Do you mind ? " <p> " Mind when I 'm scared gutless ? What 's that ? " <p> " Here . If I should vanish . " He handed me a sealed letter . " Read it aloud to the constabulary . It will help them locate me and Finnegan , lost and found . " <p> " Please , no details . I feel like a damned fool following you while Finnegan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , ' ah , those idiots above run about , freezing . I think I 'll let them freeze . " <p> " One hopes not . Get away now . If we walk together , he wo n't jump up . Alone , he 'll peer out the merest crack , glom the scene with a huge bright eye , flip down again , ssst , and one of us gone to darkness . " <p> " Not me , please . Not me . " <p> We walked on about sixty feet apart and beginning to lose one another in the half moon light . <p> " Are you there ? " called Sir Robert , from half the world away in leafy dark . <p> " I wish I were n't , " I yelled back . <p> " Onward ! " cried Sir Robert . " Do n't lose sight of me . Move closer . We 're near on the site . I can intuit , I almost feel  --  " <p> As a final cloud shifted , moonlight glowed brilliantly to show Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gasping with expectation . <p> " Closer , closer , " I heard him exhale . " Near on . Be still . Perhaps . . . " <p> He froze in place . There was something in his aspect that made me want to leap , race , and yank him off the turf he had chosen . <p> " Sir Robert , oh , God ! " I cried . " Run ! " <p> He froze . One hand and arm orchestrated the air , feeling , probing , while his other hand delved , brought forth his silver-coated flask of brandy . He held it high in the moonlight , a toast to doom . Then , afflicted with need , he took one , two , three , my God , four incredible swigs ! <p> Arms out , balancing the wind , tilting his head back , laughing like a boy , he swigged the last of his mysterious drink . <p> " All right , Finnegan , below and beneath ! " he cried . " Come get me ! " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And vanished . <p> It was all over in a second . <p> A flicker , a blur , a dark bush had grown up from the earth with a whisper , a suction , and the thud of a body dropped and a door shut . <p> The glade was empty . <p> " Sir Robert . Quick ! " <p> But there was no one to quicken . <p> Not thinking that I might be snatched and vanished , I lurched to the spot where Sir Robert had drunk his wild toast . <p> I stood staring down at earth and leaves with not a sound save my heart beating while the leaves blew away to reveal only pebbles , dry grass , and earth . <p> I must have lifted my head and bayed to the moon like a dog , then fell to my knees , fearless , to dig for lids , for tunneled tombs where a voiceless tangle of legs wove themselves , binding and mummifying a thing that had been my friend . This is his final door , I thought , insanely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his pipe , cane , and empty brandy flask , flung down when he had escaped night , life , everything . <p> Swaying up , I fired the pistol six times here into the unanswering earth , a dumb thing gone stupid as I finished and staggered over his instant graveyard , his locked-in tomb , listening for muffled screams , shrieks , cries , but heard none . I ran in circles , with no ammunition save my weeping shouts . I would have stayed all night but a downpour of leaves , a great spidering flourish of broken branches fell to panic and suffer my heart . I fled , still calling his name to a silence lidded by clouds that hid the moon . <p> At his estate I beat on the door , wailing , yanking , until I recalled : it opened inward , it was unlocked . <p> Alone in the library , with only liquor to help me live , I read the letter that Sir Robert had left behind : <p> My dear Douglas : <p> I am old and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My chemist had provided me with a sure poison that I will mix in my brandy for our walk . I will drink all . Finnegan , not knowing me as a poisoned morsel , will give me a swift invite . Now you see me , now you do n't . I will then be the weapon of his death , minutes after my own . I do not think there is another outsize nightmare like him on Earth . Once gone , that 's the end . <p> Being old , I am immensely curious . I fear not death , for my physicians tell me that if no accidents kill me , cancer will . <p> I thought of giving a poisoned rabbit to our nightmare assassin . But then I 'd never know where he was or if he really existed . Finnegan would die unseen in his monstrous closet , and I never the wiser . This way , for one victorious moment , I will know . Fear for me . Envy me . Pray for me . Sorry to abandon you without farewells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter and wept . <p> No more was ever heard of him . <p> Some say Sir Robert killed himself , an actor in his own melodrama and that one day we shall unearth his brooding , lost and Gothic body and that it was he who killed the children and that his preoccupation with doors and hinges , and more doors that led him , crazed , to study this one species of spider , and wildly plan and build the most amazing door in history , an insane burrow into which he popped to die , before my eyes , thus hoping to perpetuate the incredible Finnegan . <p> But I have found no burrow . I do not believe a man could construct such a pit , even given Sir Robert 's overwhelming passion for doors . <p> I can only ask , would a man murder , draw his victims ' blood , build an earthen vault ? For what motive ? Create the finest secret exit in all time ? Madness . And what of those large grayish balls of earth supposedly tossed forth from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert lie clasped in a velvet lined unmarked crypt , deep under . Whether one is the paranoiac alter ego of the other , I can not say . But the murders have ceased . The rabbits once more rush in Chatham Glade and its bushes teem with butterflies and birds . It is another spring , and the children run again through a loud forest , no longer silent . <p> Finnegan and Sir Robert , requiescat in pace . <p> <p> By Ray Bradbury <p> Ray Bradbury 's short fiction has inspired generation after generation of writers .
