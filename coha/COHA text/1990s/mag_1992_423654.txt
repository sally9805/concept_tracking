Section : TECH WATCH <p> Nearly every businessperson knows the horrors of playing telephone tag . It is n't unusual to make a dozen phone calls  --  or attempts  --  daily . From your New York office you may phone a sales rep at your company 's Chicago branch . She 's not in , so , you leave a message for her . <p> In the meantime , you have a meeting across town . When you get back an hour later , you discover that the Chicago rep has returned your phone call . Immediately , you call back , but now she 's out to lunch . And the cycle continues . <p> It is understood that if employees are to work together effectively they must be able to communicate with one another effectively . Unfortunately , office communication is impeded when workers are geographically dispersed or are too active to be reached at all times . <p> But vendors are coming up with ways to help businesses avoid wasting hundreds of hours playing unproductive telephone tag . The market is saturated with interoffice technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Me <p> " The easiest and simplest solution to the telephone shuffle is voice mail , " says Michael Clark , president of Richmond-based VOICE MAIL USA , which markets voice mail systems nationwide . " You 've heard of fax it to me ; now it 's VOX ( voice mailbox ) it to me . " Voice mail saves time and money . <p> " Voice mail can offer significant productivity and efficiency gains , " says Clark . " It improves message content , cuts down the overall number of telephone calls and provides a 24-hour answering capability . ' It can ensure , for instance , that the receptionist is n't constantly on the phone saying : " Please hold , please hold . " <p> From a customer service standpoint , voice mail can improve response time . Customer complaints are a sore thumb for any operation , and not getting answers fast enough is one major grievance . <p> Using voice mail , a caller can leave an accurate and detailed message on a voice mailbox if the party is n't there . Ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a name and number on a pink memo slip , says Clark . <p> The voice mail industry was born out of frustration . Granted , the earlier systems that emerged in the late 1980s meta great deal of resistance . This was partly because messages were hard to access , often disappearing into electronic black holes . Despite the fact that some callers resent talking to a machine , voice mail is gaining greater acceptance . <p> More than 15 million voice mailbox users exist . The $1 billion market is expected to more than double in size by 1995 , according to Cedar Knolls , N.J.-based Probe Research Inc . <p> Voice mail traditionally has been a message taker  --  when someone calls , a message is taken electronically . Voice messaging , an extension of voice mail , allows for two-way communications within and outside a company . A voice mailbox user can send , receive , redirect and reply to messages or broadcast them to other network users . <p> Imagine a business day where you send and respond to messages simply by pushing a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation with five , 10 , 50 or even 200 business associates , locally or nationally , all of which is done simultaneously . This is possible through interactive voice messaging services . <p> Voice messaging is n't passive like an answering machine ; instead it can be an active means of interoffice communications . Its value may be more apparent in businesses with mobile work forces and multiple work sites . <p> The leading voice mail vendor is Octel Communications Corp. , Milpitas , Calif. , which has a 22% market share . Other key players : VMX Inc. , San Jose , Calif. ; ROM Corp. , Santa Clara , Calif. ; American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . ( AT &T),; New York City ; and Northern Telecom Inc. , Nashville , Tenn . <p> The main distinction among the various vendors ' voice mail systems has to do with the type of PBX or switching device they interface with . But there are different degrees of functionality and features . Essentially , it is up to the subscriber to create a voice mail system that meets his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer custom-designed menus , voice prompts , greetings and prerecorded announcements . <p> Ideally , the business should identity its most frequent callers : clients , customers , family members or friends . From there , the business can determine the level of functionality needed . <p> Furthermore , the flexibility of these systems makes it easier for businesses to handle callers who are put off by machines or who are " technophobic . " In this case , you would n't let the telephone be the first voice they hear . One option would be to have two incoming lines . One could be used by repeat callers who are familiar with the system and comfortable with it ; they could call the voice mailbox directly . The second line could have a live operator at the other end to handle new callers . <p> Voice mail systems are available through any number of channels , including telephone systems dealers , voice processing manufacturers , subsidiaries of Regional Bell Operating Companies ( RBOCS ) , telecommunications consultants and value-added resellers ( VARS ) . <p> Initial installation fees can range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users . And that does n't include maintenance fees , which generally are 5% to 10% of the purchase price per year . An alternative to on-premises equipment is to use automated telephone service bureaus . Monthly service charges range from $10 to $30 . Electronic Post Office <p> Another alternative to telephone tag and interoffice paper memos is electronic mail or e-mail . Using these computer-based programs , users can send and receive messages to and from each other . Just as the post office can deliver more than letters , the right e-mail package can deliver a variety of interactive information . <p> Today , some 20 million users in the United States transmit about 15 billion e-mail messages each year . There are three main options . A user can enlist a third-party service bureau that provides e-mail ; use a public data network , such as CompuServe , Prodigy or America Online ; or purchase an e-mail software package that runs on large or personal computer systems . <p> The architecture of the office will dictate what e-mail system a business can set up , says Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arlington , Va . " In the mainframe environment , IBM Corp . ' s PROFS dominates and in the minicomputer environment Digital Equipment Corp . ' s ( DEC ) All-In-One mail program is more popular . " <p> There are a host of e-mail packages for PC-based networks and LANs ( local area networks ) . With some 1.5 million f its cc : Mail programs installed , Lotus Development Corp. , Cambridge , Mass. , is the market leader . Lotus acquired the pioneering LAN messaging package from cc : Mail Inc. a year ago . <p> Another popular program is LotusNotes , which incorporates e-mail and information-sharing applications . Other industry forerunners are Microsoft Mail for PC networks from Microsoft Corp . in Redmond , Wash. , Higgins from Enable Software Inc. in Ballston Lake , N.Y. , and DaVinci Mail from DaVinci Systems Corp . in Raleigh , N.C. ( DaVinci recently purchased Action Technologies ' famed groupware software The Coordinator . <p> In terms of the core of electronic messaging , the various systems are similar in functionability , although there are some distinctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications . <p> Several companies are looking to e-mail networks for work-group applications in which employees can share all types of data using their computers . Whether managers are considering buying the first e-mail system or enhancing an existing one , they are faced with an emerging need for intercompany and international electronic communications . <p> PHOTO : LotusNotes from Lotus Development Corp. , provides an open platform for work group-based applications . lt allows users to share all types of information : text , numerical data and graphics . LotusNotes sells at a minimum of 200 users at $400 per license ( $295 for more than 2.500 users ) . Lotus also offers cc : Mail Gateway , which lets Notes and cc : Mail users exchange mail . <p> By Carolyn M. Brown <p>
