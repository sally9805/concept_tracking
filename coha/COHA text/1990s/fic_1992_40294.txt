Ida closed her bedroom door and leaned against it , momentarily relieved to breathe air that was free of cigarette smoke and the fumes of bootleg whiskey . Even in her room she could n't escape the loud strains of James Brown  --  " Please ! Please ! Please ! "  --  whose rough shouts seemed to cut through her stereo like a jagged blade . She pulled away from the door and went to her closet , reached in the back , and drew out three bottles of white lightning . Outside her room was the raucous laughter of a household of people feeling no pain . She clenched her eyes and imagined that her entire house was empty and peaceful . <p> In Hopewell and its environs , Ida 's was the place to be on Friday and Saturday nights . To get in cost a dollar , the whiskey was fifty cents a drink , and fried-chicken , catfish and tamale dinners were another dollar . People from as far away as Yazoo City came to her door some nights looking for a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got . <p> The idea to turn her house into a weekend pay party came from her cousin Louis when he was home from Chicago for a visit . The same year the Illinois Central stopped operating , Ida heard a knock on her door one day , and when she opened it , there he was . Tall and as narrow as a piece of wire , he had on a flaming-red suit and bright-yellow patent-leather shoes with crooked heels that leaned so dangerously to one side that it appeared they would fall off at any minute . And he wore a hat , canary-yellow , with a high crown and a twirling red feather that tilted toward the sky like some bird about to take flight . Under the hat was the slickest , shiniest head of conked hair that Ida had ever seen . Louis had always been what the older folks in Hopewell called " worldly . " <p> " In Chicago we give rent parties , " Louis told her , after she fed him breakfast . " We party all day and all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . " <p> Louis took her to a bootlegger he knew who had a still on the outskirts of town , and Ida bought two bottles of his finest white lightning . Her cousin found a stereo and some record albums for her to borrow . " How y'all stay in this backwater place without no music ? " he asked disdainfully . Two days before the party , he spread the word among all the people he knew in Hopewell and nearby towns that there would be a pay party at Ida 's home . " Now you need to send them children off somewhere , " he told her . " They stay here , they liable to get miseducated . " <p> She made $53 that first night , and even after Louis took 20 percent , she was looking at money it would have taken her more than two months to earn as a maid . She told herself she would n't be running a juke joint for long . As soon as her father was well enough to go back to work , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knock on her bedroom door and then her father 's voice , low and furtive . " Ida . Ida . Sheriff Barnes out here asking for you . " <p> " He the most paid-off cracker in Mississippi , " Louis said when he told her that the sheriff would want a cut . She had n't had three parties before Barnes knocked on her door , his eyes on her hips , his hand held out . <p> She opened the dresser drawer and fumbled around until she felt her wallet . She pulled out $25 and put the money in the pocket of her dress . After she shut the drawer , she opened her bedroom door , then locked it with a key . <p> The sheriff was around the back of the house , standing a little ways from the porch , in the shadows . " Hey there , Ida , " he said when he saw her coming toward him . " Looks like a nice little crowd tonight . " He grinned and let his eyes travel all over her body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her . <p> She nodded to him and handed him the money . <p> " Well , thank you kindly , " he said . He moved closer to her with a sudden sinuous movement that affected her like fingernails scraping a blackboard . " Did I ever tell you , " he whispered , his breath hot and sour , " did I ever tell you how much I like me some yella peaches ? " He put his hand on her arm . <p> She could hear him laughing as she snatched herself away . <p> The house was hot inside . Couples were groping and twirling in a furious fast dance to the strains of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles . Looking at her customers , Ida realized that she was in for another long night . She hoped that nobody would start fighting . <p> Around two o'clock in the morning , when the party began to get quiet and the loud music had been replaced by a steady spate of slow-drag records , there was a knock on her front door . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the men was the color of weak tea , and the other was as dark a chocolate as she had ever tasted . They were dressed almost identically , in khaki pants , plaid shirts and tennis shoes . She was mesmerized by their hair , which stood out wildly , encircling their heads as though they 'd both stuck their fingers in an electric socket at the same time . Ida remembered seeing another person with hair like theirs , the grandson of one of the women in the neighborhood , a boy who 'd come home for the summer from Chicago . No one said anything for a moment , and the three of them just stared at one another until finally the chocolate-colored man said , " We heard we could get some drinks here . " <p> " And something to eat , " the other man added . <p> They were n't from the Delta or even the South ; Ida knew that much from their voices . She figured that they were civil-rights workers , which should have scared her but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes riveted on their hair . <p> " May we come in ? " the chocolate one asked softly . His accent sounded hard and busy to Ida , like high heels on concrete , the way she imagined Chicago , but his eyes were soft and so frankly interested that she felt embarrassed and looked away . She had been blocking their entrance with her body , and now she stood to one side to allow them room to enter . " It costs a dollar to get in , " Ida said . <p> The rest of the people stopped slow-dragging and stood in the middle of the floor as though they 'd been caught in a game of Red Light , Green Light , their bodies slumped over each other and motionless . The music ended , and no one bothered to put on another record . " Sit anywhere , " Ida told her new guests . " I got whiskey and I have fried-chicken , tamale and rib dinners . " <p> The two men ordered drinks and two tamale dinners . They ate and drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone was too busy staring at their towering hair . <p> The chocolate one was Dan . The other one was Eddie . They were both from New York and gave no reason for being in Hopewell . They became regulars . <p> One Saturday night , when Ida was in the kitchen fixing plates , she looked up and Dan was standing in the doorway , staring at her and smiling . " I ca n't get enough of your cooking , " he said . She put her hand on her blouse and fingered the top button , afraid that it would pop open from the sheer power of his eyes . Later that same night , Ida overheard Dan asking one of the men if he would like to register and vote , saying that he and Eddie were working with a group of people who wanted to make sure that Blacks in Mississippi started voting . <p> Ida pulled Dan aside as he was leaving and spoke carefully , in a low voice . " Dan , people come to my place to have a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , they wo n't come back . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " I 'm talking about this : Colored people do n't vote in Hopewell . " <p> " They do n't vote because they have n't been allowed to vote . That 's going to change . " <p> " What do you know about a town like Hopewell ? Y'all come down here from New York like you gon ' save somebody 's life , but more than likely somebody will get killed . " <p> " We 're trying to change things . We know you 're scared . We 're scared , too , but I 'm more afraid of what will happen if we do n't try . " <p> " You ca n't come to this house talking to people about voting . " <p> He stepped toward her , smiling as he moved . " Well , can I come and talk to you sometime ? You 're not married , are you ? " He was grinning at her , his hands in his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head like a wiry halo . <p> " No . You 're trouble . " Her chest felt tight , as though a small rubber band was wrapped around it ; she could hardly breathe . <p> " Yeah . I am . " <p> She was still smiling when she watched him drive away in that strange insectlike car of his . <p> He came back on Sunday evening , just as Fern and Lizzie Mae were putting away the dinner dishes . Ida was sitting on the front porch , watching Sweetbabe play with one of the neighbor 's dogs , when she saw Dan coming across the front yard . He was on her porch before she had a chance to worry about how she looked . " I told you I 'd be back , " he said . <p> He stayed until almost midnight and returned with such consistency and regularity that Ida got used to his being there . Sometimes he would bring a half-gallon of ice cream and spoon up some for all the family . Once he brought two live hens to Ida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was feeling homesick , he would sit on her porch and sing rhythm-and-blues songs : The Temptations , The Dells , Smokey Robinson and the Miracles . He knew all the parts . <p> " You a one-man show , " Ida said , grinning . <p> " Live at the Apollo , " he said and then laughed at her puzzled look . <p> Fern and Lizzie Mae teased Sweetbabe and called Dan his new daddy . Ida did n't correct them . <p> They were sitting in the parlor alone one Wednesday night when Dan leaned over and kissed her so softly she was n't sure it had happened , except that suddenly she was kissing him back . His hands were warm under her blouse , his fingers hot as they unhooked her bra and pulled it down . He raised up her blouse and stared at her breasts until she felt her nipples stiffen from the intensity of his gaze . Then he pulled her blouse down and said , " Where can I make love to you ? " <p> They did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lay back and stretched out her arms to pull him down on top of her . " Wait , " he said . " Sit up . " <p> He smiled the whole time he undressed her , and he kissed every bare part of her . She was glistening from his tongue by the time he was lying naked beside her . When she felt his tongue between her legs , she tensed up . No one had ever put his mouth on her there before . <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " I want to taste you , " he whispered . <p> " That 's nasty , " she said . " White people be doing that . " <p> " Do I look white ? Baby , I do n't want to make you do nothing you do n't want to do . I just want to make you feel good , " he said , rubbing her thigh until she felt herself going limp . " Let me just kiss it real quick . Let me kiss your pussy so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She giggled . " That all right with you ? " <p> She felt his lips on her pubic hair . <p> " Now , you tell me when to stop , baby . " His lips were traveling from her hairy mound to her thighs . She lay back and put her hands on Dan 's neck . " You tell me when to stop , Ida . " Then she felt something soft and wet between her legs , moving up inside her . " It 's all right , " he said . " It 's how we make love in Harlem . " When the first wave of pleasure hit her , she collapsed into him , grabbing his shoulders , kissing his chest and the palms of his hands . After her body became peaceful , he started kissing her all over again . He moved his mouth swiftly from one breast to another until she began shivering and arching and then he slid into her . They made love until neither one of them could move . When they finally fell apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts as he spoke , " You got the best cooking . You got the best pussy . Man would be a fool to leave a woman like you . " <p> She put her hand over his mouth , but he pushed it away . " I know what I 'm saying . " He kissed her mouth , and his tongue tasted strange to her until she realized that she was on his tongue . <p> " Nobody ever done that to me before , " she said softly . " Down here they think that is dirty . " <p> " Do you think so ? " He held her chin with his hands and guided it until she had to look at him . <p> She closed her eyes . When she opened them , she was smiling . <p> " Maybe next time you 'll do me . " She made a face . <p> " I 'll put something on it to make it taste real good . " <p> She gasped and covered her face with her hands so she could n't see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " <p> " Honey . Barbecue sauce . Melted chocolate . Whatever you want . " <p> " You so nasty , " she whispered . <p> " Where 'd you get this white-girl hair ? You part white , ai n't you ? " <p> She nodded , lowering her eyes . <p> " William ai n't your real father ? " <p> " No . My real daddy is white , but that 's all I know . " <p> " Hey " he said , moving close to her , kissing her on the mouth . " Ai n't nothing to be ashamed of . " He hugged her . <p> She moved away . " Yes , it is . " <p> " Hey , " he said , grabbing her and pulling her close . " It ai n't your shame . And it ai n't your mama 's , either . " <p> She started crying . " Thank you . That 's the best thing anybody ever told me . " They were quiet for a long time , and then Ida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his head was lying on her breast . His wiry hair was scratchy on her bare skin . So much hair . " Why 'd you come down here ? " <p> " To help Black people get registered to vote . " <p> " How did you decide to do that ? " <p> " I got inspired after I went to the March on Washington . " <p> " I was watching the March on Washington on television , but they blacked it out before I could hear Martin Luther King Jr. , speak . " <p> Dan lifted his head and looked at Ida . " What do you mean , ' blacked it out ' ? " <p> " If there 's something that the white people do n't want us to see on television , they just take it off . Make the screen go black . That 's how they do down here . " <p> Dan nodded ; his eyes looked past Ida . Before , she had n't noticed the veins in his neck , but now they seemed to stick out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he did n't know where she was . When she pressed her soft breasts into his back and rubbed her hands across his chest , he did n't respond , and moments later he stood up . " I got ta go , " he said , putting on his pants . <p> " Are you gon ' come back ? " <p> He bent down and brushed the top of her ass with his lips , licked the tips of her breasts and then kissed her mouth . " Yeah . " <p> Dan came back every night that summer , always bringing her a little present , as well as treats for the others and cigarettes for her father . " One day , " he told her , " when things have changed , this wo n't be a bad place for Black folks to be . We 've always run to the big cities , but our future is in the South . " <p> " My future 's in Chicago , " she felt like saying , but she did n't want him to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything he said she could see , and what she saw made her dreams of life in Chicago grow pale . <p> " I could be happy here , " he told her . She did n't say so , but she was dreaming of happiness , too . <p> She heard the chugging sound of his Volkswagen  --  the only one she 'd ever seen  --  one night . Dan ran across the yard and grabbed her up by her wrists and swung her around and leaned her way back , kissing her until she was breathless . When he let go of her , he said , " I think I 've got a man who 'll register . " <p> His eyes reflected a shimmering kind of delirious joy that she 'd never seen before ; it frightened and amazed her all at once . There was danger in his eyes , at least a warning , but before she could heed it , they were in her room , taking their clothes off , and the radiance in his eyes was for her . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take your turn ? " he asked . She looked up , and he was couching over her , his knees on either side of her neck , lowering himself slowly . <p> He tasted almost sweet . <p> Afterward Dan whispered to her , " I 'll be back tomorrow . " <p> But he did n't come back the next day or the next or for too many days to count without pain sweeping through her like wildfire . Every night she was n't with him , she cried and remembered his faint , sugary taste in her mouth . She closed her eyes in the middle of the day over a sink of dirty dishes and recalled his smoothness on her tongue , remembered the stiffness between her teeth . She wondered how long she 'd be able to taste him . <p> She blamed herself for his desertion . She was a whore for letting him lick her down there , a whore for taking him in her mouth . During the day she was listless , and at night she ran for miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall asleep . The family got on her nerves , and she shooed Sweetbabe away when he wanted to read aloud to her even though his teacher had told her he was slow and needed practice . At the party on Saturday night , she burned her tamales , the first time that ever happened . <p> When Ida brought the sheriff his money that night , he was n't waiting in the back , where she usually found him . She stood near the back porch for a moment and then walked around the house to the front , in time to see Barnes peering through the window of the living room , where her customers were dancing . " What you looking at , Sheriff ? You ai n't never seen colored people having a good time before ? " <p> He whirled around at the sound of her voice , and when he faced Ida , his hand was on his gun . Ida wobbled a little on her feet as she watched the sheriffs fingers . She did n't know what to do or say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fixed , penetrating way that conveyed more power than she felt . When she looked at his hands again , they were dangling by his sides . <p> " Oh , I sure done seen that , " he said . <p> She could n't speak for a moment , not until after several deep breaths . " What ai n't you seen ? " <p> " I 'm looking for two northern nigras who done come down here trying to get the rest of y'all worked up about voting . Ai n't no need of that . Any nigra around here can vote , so long as he can pay his poll tax and answer a few simple questions . That 's the law , and I mean to uphold it . " <p> Ida handed him the $25 . She concentrated on making her voice calm and unconcerned . " All the people in my house is from right around here . " <p> " Well , it 'd be healthier to keep it that way . " He gave her a long appraising look , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peaches , " he said , grinning . <p> Ida had been in bed for an hour , trying to sleep when she heard movement outside her window . In the moonlight she could see the shadow of a man . Even before she heard the tapping , she was running to the front door . <p> " Eddie 's gone . The organization sent him to the eastern part of the state . You got ta help me , baby . " <p> " Where you been ? I did n't hear ... " <p> He waved his hand . " I was working about 15 miles south of here . Trying to get folks registered . I almost had two guys who were willing ... " <p> " Why you did n't come see me or call ? " <p> " I was working , baby . " His words were tight and hard as bullets . " I need your help . " He squeezed her arm . " Let me talk to some of your customers . Try to get them registered . It 's ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you do that . " <p> " Well , then you talk to them . " <p> " And say what ? " <p> " Tell them to register to vote . Tell them they can make a difference in their own lives . " <p> " Do you know what you asking ? You asking me to get some people killed , that 's what . In case you ai n't heard , this here is Klan country . Those good-timing folks feed my family . And if they get run off or killed , are you gon ' do that ? " <p> " You 're a leader , Ida , " he said , seizing both her wrists . " You have influence around here . People respect you . If you tell them to do something they 'll at least think about it . " <p> " I 'm not a leader , Dan . " <p> " Ida , listen ... " <p> She held her hand up ; the fingers splayed out wide and then slowly curled up . " You better go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to New York , and when they asked if he would ever return , she said no and offered no further explanation . Gradually their references to the Moon Pies and RC Colas Dan used to bring them , the funny things he said , dwindled and then ceased altogether . <p> Ida 's grief was not so easily dissolved . She cried in spells that summer when she least expected to : after a long run , in the middle of counting money , while she combed her hair . There were tears in the dinners she served and in the glasses of white lightning she sold . Days filled with weeping passed one after another , and weeks went by without her smiling . Sometimes she wore the same dress for two or three days in a row , and her hair often went uncombed . Then one day , long after Sweetbabe had stopped mentioning Dan , she heard her son 's thin , angry voice declaring , " I 'm going to kill Mr. Dan for making my mama so sad . " She looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open at the puffy eyes , uncombed hair and bedraggled figure she saw . <p> She began running every night like a demon , and during the day she cooked until her fingers refused to move . She expanded her vegetable garden , and when the crop came in she canned everything she could . Her goal was simple : to forget his laugh , to not think of his touch or his taste or the taste of herself on his lips . <p> Bebe Moore Campbell is a contributing writer for ESSENCE .
