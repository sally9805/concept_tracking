DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF Brook Lane , close to the ford , stood Brook Cottage  --  built of rusty brown ironstone , roofed in blue slate which lichen had yellowed . The only occupants were Janet Meadows , in her seventies , and her marmalade cat , Duffy . <p> On a Sunday afternoon in Spring , Amanda Whitaker brought her school sketchbook to show to the old lady  --  whose home was full of charmingly naive little pictures of cats and flowers painted by herself . If Amanda 's dad had n't spent that morning repainting a couple of window frames at home , the girl might n't have noticed that the paintwork of Brook Cottage was cracked and peeling . Along the overgrown verge daffodils were dying , but in shaded parts bluebells were about to bloom . Recent downpours had swollen the brook till the ford had expanded into a huge pond , lapping the low footbridge . <p> Scarcely had Amanda rung the door bell than a crash resounded inside the house  --  as if an actual bell had fallen on to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was sighing and shaking her head . <p> " Oh dear , " was her greeting . <p> Short and stout , Mrs. Meadows wore a floral frock of forget-me-nots and primroses . Well-worn slippers were on her feet . Lines creased her face , mainly from smiling , though in repose the effect could seem hostile ; and she was frowning now . The old lady 's straggly unkempt gray hair was another reason for village kids to scare a new arrival about a witch living in Brook Cottage . Amanda had once fallen for this prank . By the age of twelve Amanda knew so much better about Mrs. Meadows ' kindliness . <p> Right now , Mrs. Meadows seemed none too happy . Amanda clutched the sketchhook awkwardly . " Have I come at the wrong time ? " <p> But the old lady gestured the girl to come in . " You can help me clear up . Duffy was on the sideboard . The bell startled him and he knocked a vase off . " <p> " I 'm sorry  --  " <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had n't rung your bell just now  --  " <p> Along a dim hall they went , into a living room bright with sunlight and pot-plants and pictures . A china vase had shattered on the parquet floor . Pieces had hopped onto the central rug . Duffy skulked by the French window , a bewildered look in his eyes . Floodwater spilled across the far end of the lawn . <p> Mrs. Meadows opened the glass door and shooed her pet out . " Now at least he wo n't be able to cut his paw into the bargain ! " Nodding toward the unkempt garden : " It would need to pour for another few days before <p> I get my feet wet in here . " Yet look , the sun was shining brightly . <p> " I 'm so sorry about the vase  --  " <p> " Duffy once kicked himself in the eye when he was trying to scratch his cheek ... " <p> Amanda giggled , and Mrs. Meadows smiled at last . <p> " The vet tested my dimwit 's reflexes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' You just happen to have a very clumsy cat , Mrs. Meadows , ' he told me . Aside from that , Duffy 's so lovable . " <p> With brush and pan , on hands and knees , they hunted for all the fragments . <p> " He 's the only cat I 've known who can fall off a bed ! He rolls about on his back and forgets where he is . " <p> " How many cats have you had ? " <p> " Duffy 's the fifth . " <p> " I 'd love a cat . Mum and Dad say it would be bad for my asthma . " <p> " Not if he was your own special cat ... Oh but it 's always so sad when they die . You must take them to the vet . You watch their eyes glaze over . There 's nothing to fill the aching emptiness except to get another one . Duffy 's my last . He 'll live as long as I do . " <p> " How old is Duffy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still young , then  --  ! " <p> " He 's so daft I can easily imagine him falling out of a tree or even drowning himself in the brook . Actually , " confided Mrs. Meadows , " I think his brain 's a bit crumpled because he was the last cat out of the box . The other ones must have been pressing on his head . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> Mrs. Meadows brought the cat box , and set it on the low table next to Amanda 's sketchbook . <p> " It 's beautiful  --  ! " <p> " I painted this when I was just a little older than you , Amanda , and  --  what do you know ?  --  it all came true . " <p> Hinged at the top , the wooden box was about five inches wide and high , perhaps ten inches long . On each side and on the lid , a different cat was emblazoned . On top , a mischievous black and white cat sharpened his claws on what might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its face , white bib and socks . <p> Round the sides of the box ran a continuous landscape of turquoise grass spotted with flowers , trees and shrubs . A rainbow in the sky . Cartoony clouds . An orange sun . Chevrons of birds . In each panel , variously standing or sitting , were : a white cat with green eyes , a slinky all-black cat , a pompous blue-cream Persian , and finally a marmalade Duffy looking doleful . <p> Mrs. Meadows opened the box to reveal little pots of paint , then she shut the lid and tapped the top picture . <p> " This is Morris . I 'd had him for a year when I painted him . So I decided to paint some other cats to keep him company . Morris lived till he was seventeen , when he died of a horrid cancer in the throat . The very next day , a friend of mine arrived with a white kitten for me . My friend did n't know anything about my box . And I thought it was only a coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted till I was , oh , forty-three . He was so eager  --  forever licking me . Oh the rasp of his tongue on my ear ! He smelled quite like a boiled egg , and compared with Morris he was n't much brainier than an egg  --  " <p> Next , had come all-black Poppy . Poppy was underweight but incredibly bright and busy . If Poppy had been a human child , she would have been classed as hyperactive . What a hunter she was . Cut a swathe through the local mice and shrews and moles and sparrows and robins , she did . It still only seemed rather more of a fluke that Poppy should follow Snowy , exactly as on the box . <p> The blue-cream Persian , Susie , clocked in when Janet was fifty-two . This could no longer be a coincidence . Susie was a pedigree , and her registered name was Moonflower of Dunesk . However , she was n't a showable cat . Janet acquired Susie as a gift from the breeder , who was keen to dispose of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her snub nose was too flat for her own comfort . Breathing difficulties affected her eyes , but she lasted pompously for fifteen years . During her last year Susie took to wetting on the floor . She howled as if she 'd forgotten where she was . Kidney trouble claimed her . By then she 'd become as senile as an old lady in a nursing home . <p> And into Brook Cottage had wandered young stray Duffy , who 'd probably forgotten how to find his way back to his former home , though nobody ever claimed him . <p> " My marmalade dimwit followed my Persian , exactly as on the box ! I 'd painted a prophecy with my inks . " Mrs. Meadows smiled . " Now let 's see your work , shall we ? " <p> Why , this sketchbook was splendid . Such realistic pencil drawings  --  of jam jars with pencils in them , and kitchen implements . A food processor . Tools from the garage . All the shading was perfect . Marks were nine out of ten , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was very keen on realism and accuracy . But here at last was a fine vase of daffodils . <p> " Such skill , " enthused Mrs. Meadows . She glanced at her own pictures , which were n't photographic but were surely more expressive . " Maybe there could be a touch more ... magic ? No , I see you ca n't do that at school . Food mixers and spanners ! " The old lady leaned toward Amanda . " I think if you were to paint this box of mine the way I did , using the colors inside , then ... what you painted might come true , just the way it did for me . " <p> " But , " pointed out Amanda , " the box is already painted . " <p> " We only need to slap white paint all over it first . " <p> " It 's beautiful . " <p> " Oh , it 's rather faded compared with what it was once . So it needs new pictures on it . The old ones are used up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had sniffed the flood and now returned to stare plaintively through the the glass door . He began to miaow but the miaow became a yawn . <p> " Soon , Duffy , soooon , " Mrs. Meadows cooed . " Now Snowy , my boiled egg , he would paddle away at that door with his front paws as if he thought he ought to be able to walk through the glass . My cleverest cat was Poppy  --  oh , and I must n't forget Morris  --  but none is darter than Duffy ; though never mind . I 'll tell you what , Amanda : I shall paint the box white myself . Come and collect it after school tomorrow . Then you can paint it as you like , just as I did . " <p> Amanda pondered . " What do you think I ought to paint ? " <p> " Whatever you please ! Whatever you want ! That 's my assignment to you , dear . " <p> On her way homeward up the lane , Amanda thought about cats dying . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of muddled brains . Her special cat would n't die for years and years yet , not till Amanda was almost thirty years old , which was scarcely imaginable . Surely there was no need to visualize a whole lifetime of cats . What else would Amanda wish for ? Not in another fifteen years time , and thirty years time , and fifty , but now ? <p> The girl did realize that Mrs. Meadows was indulging in a delicious fantasy . But mainly , the old lady hoped that a touch of magic would enter Amanda 's art , to accompany the nine-out-of-ten skill at drawing . Amanda was n't offended , not at all . Spanners and food mixers were all very well ! That was too much like Dad , who was an architect . To evoke magic , of course she should believe in the effectiveness of painting the box . Mr. Peters had shown Amanda 's class photos of the first pictures ever painted by people , when people still lived in caves . The motive , said Mr. Peters , had been to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . <p> Mrs. Meadows was n't as fanciful as she seemed . And without a doubt Amanda must only paint living creatures on the box , not something cold and mechanical such as a new bicycle . <p> NEXT SATURDAY , Amanda worked in her bedroom all morning . Mrs. Meadows ' style seemed to rub off upon her , though admittedly Amanda was copying the way she remembered it . It was as if the white background preserved a ghost or memory . <p> Just before lunch , she finished the box . Taking care not to trip , she carried it downstairs on a piece of cardboard and set it upon the tiled worktop in the kitchen . <p> Lunch was to be a salad of pate , spring onion , hard-boiled quail 's egg , leaf of lettuce , and a cherry tomato , accompanied by rye biscuits . Amanda 's mum , Sarah , was thwarting her daughter 's tendency to plumpness . Her dad , Paul , could well lose a few pounds too . In the early evening the Whitakers would eat more lavishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gifted Amanda with her looks , her pert oval face , her curly blond hair . Stocky Paul must have contributed the genes for build . What of the girl 's artistic eye ? Paul Whitaker was an architect , but Sarah had trained as a landscape designer and she worked part-time as a consultant at the big garden center eight miles from the village . <p> " Why , that 's lovely , " Sarah exclaimed . " It 's so fresh , so bright , so different . It looks Indian , like those little boxes you buy in Asia Emporium . It is n't from there , is it ? " <p> " Hardly , " said Paul . " The colors still look wet . Is this a school project ? " <p> Amanda shook her head . " It 's my pet box . Mrs. Meadows gave me the box and the paints last weekend . Whatever I put on the lid and the sides will happen , she said . On the lid , which is first , I put ... " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Amanda , " Sarah gently reminded her daughter . <p> " Mrs. Meadows said that a pet from the box would n't harm me . Oh , it 's all right , Mum ! I know it 's make-believe . I really painted the box so as to ... well , freshen my style ; loosen it . " <p> " That 's rather a mature attitude , " marveled Paul . " But ... do n't let your work become too loose . Mr. Peters would n't approve . " <p> " I 'm not trying to be an architect with my box , Dad ! I already know how to draw . This is different . It 's a bit of ... magic . " <p> Sarah hastened to praise the box again . On one side was a Scottish Terrier with wiry jet-black coat , stumpy legs , and a look of dogged loyalty as if on dwarfish sentry duty . On the second side : a red hen . On the third : a gray Chinchilla rabbit . <p> " Whatever next ? A goat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a brown body patterned like a bicycle tire , and a flaring hood . <p> " Good God , that 's a cobra ! " <p> " I know it is , Dad . I started to do an ordinary snake , ' cos I thought since snakes do n't have fur a snake could n't possibly give me an asthma attack . Then I felt it ought to look more dramatic . " <p> " It 's certainly that , " he agreed . " Reminds me of that nursery rhyme , in fact . ' The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly . ' The cat bites the hen . The dog bites the cat . The snake bites the dog . " <p> " You do n't like my box , do you ? I spent all morning . " <p> " Honestly , " said Paul , " it 's beautiful . It 's imaginative . Just so long as you do n't imagine ... well , that an actual cat or dog ... " <p> " As if I would ! I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Oh dear , " sighed Mrs. Meadows when she turned the box , bringing the cobra into view . Duffy 's ginger tail fluffed out . He hissed , then scuttled . Something about the movement of the box must have startled him , since even the cleverest cat would be blind to pictures . <p> " Well , what 's done 's done , I suppose . You 'll simply have to watch your step , Amanda . " ( Amanda was grinning , pleased at the surprise . ) " I do n't suppose it 's very likely that a cobra would . . . I mean , I have n't heard of anyone keeping snakes around here . There are n't even vipers in these parts . It would have to be a grass snake . Those are completely harmless . In fact , I saw one swimming in the brook a couple of weeks ago . A grass snake would even fit into your box . I do wish you had n't ! " <p> " Should we paint that side white again ? Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ! Not now . You made your choice . It 'll be a grass snake , you 'll see : " <p> " When ? " demanded Amanda . <p> " It 'll be the last one out of the box , wo n't it now ? " Mrs. Meadows said reasonably . " That might n't be for years and years . Oh dear , but you must n't ever go to India , or wherever cobras live . Promise me that . " <p> Amanda chuckled . She was enjoying herself . Really , the snake had been a wonderful inspiration . <p> " What if I 'd painted ... ooh , a dinosaur ? Just a baby dinosaur ? " <p> Mrs. Meadows concentrated . " Well , those were lizards , were n't they ? The modem version would be ... a newt ? " she speculated . <p> " I saw a program on TV which said that birds are descended from dinosaurs . " Amanda pointed into the garden in mock alarm . " Watch out , here comes Tyrannosaurus Robin ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Robins are fierce to each other , " the old lady said sternly . " If you 're a beetle , they must seem like demons . " Turning the the cobra to face Amanda , she laid her hands on the cat-lid as if conferring a blessing . " Take care of yourself . " <p> A week later , the white cat came into the Whitakers ' lives . Presenting itself on their kitchen windowsill , it mewed insistently for admission . Thanks to Amanda 's pleas , Sarah conceded that they could open a can of sardines and feed the animal on the patio . No sooner was the door open than the white cat rushed inside . It leapt on to the worktop , from there on to Amanda 's shoulder . A-throb with purrs , it rubbed itself against her cheek . <p> Amanda did n't choke . Her airways did n't block up with any sudden constriction . She did n't need her ventilator . A few days later , Paul installed a cat flap in the kitchen door . <p> Amanda was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident , being as how the box had been repainted and had now produced a new cat  --  seemingly . Of course this was all a bit of make-believe . But even so . <p> A visit to the old lady reassured her . <p> " Duffy 's linked to me by love , and by all the time we 've spent together , " Mrs. Meadows told Amanda . " I 'm here all day long , after all . " <p> Amanda could n't be home all day long , no more than her Mum or Dad could . <p> Snowy , named in honor of the old lady 's earlier pet , proved to be deaf . Even loud noises never caused an ear to twitch . The driver of the oil delivery truck , a month later , protested that he had hooted and hooted again . <p> Naturally , Snowy did n't hear a thing . Pray that he felt nothing , either . Spine broken , head crushed . It was as Mrs. Meadows had said : the sheer grief , never mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Into this aching void there trotted MacTavish , soon to be abbreviated to Tavvy . No collar , no name-disk  --  but in fine condition . Paul pinned a card on the notice board in the village and in surrounding villages , but no one phoned to claim the Scottish Terrier , so chunky and obedient and friendly and all the things that he ought to be . <p> Six weeks later , while Amanda was walking Tavvy on her return from school , the Pattersons ' Boxer bitch leapt a fence and savaged the Scotty to death . It did n't even help that Amanda was there in person . Her terrified screams brought neighbors , and Sarah too , but the Boxer already seemed abashed . Sarah phoned the police , who were unhelpful . Soon Paul was back . So were the Pattersons , who had left their dog to roam their garden during the day . Bitter words volleyed . The Pattersons certainly did not intend to destroy their beloved Boxer who was usually as meek as a kitten , so they insisted . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a red hen was there  --  with russet body , greenish tail-feathers , red comb and wattle . The hen eyed Amanda and clucked . <p> No one nearby kept poultry . After the burial of Tavvy , Sarah drove to the garden center to buy chicken wire and stakes . She and Paul erected an enclosure for the solitary hen , walled and roofed with wire . <p> " There , that 's like Fort Knox , " Paul announced when the work was done . " How long do hens normally live ? " he asked . " Three years ? Five ? " Amanda cried herself to sleep , her pet box on her bed beside her . <p> Her father brought home a large hutch in which the hen could roost . And hay and chicken feed . <p> For a while Amanda refused to name her hen . Mrs. Meadows ' talk about the death of pets seemed like a curse . Was a hen any substitute for Tavvy or Snowy ? She ought to have painted cats and cats only . <p> As though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg . Sarah had found out that the breed was called Welsummer . A good season surely awaited the bird . So Amanda named her hen Summer . Only later did she remember that Autumn follows . <p> Could she love a pet which might die ? Anxious because of this while at school , her work suffered a bit . She knew the hen was safe in the stockade . However , the bird might develop a hen illness such as pox or diarrhea , or she might pick up gapeworm . Even so , the long Summer holiday had almost arrived , the holiday with Summer  --  not that a hen was quite as communicative as a dog or a cat . <p> That year , the Whitakers did n't go away to the seaside or abroad . Neither Amanda nor her parents were willing to leave Summer to a neighbor 's care . Nor actually did Amanda want to leave at all . <p> Going back to school in September was a wrench , though surely the hen had established herself by now . <p> Come the mists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had installed a heat-lamp in the hutch . By the faint light they could check on Summer from the kitchen window before going to bed . <p> In that soft red glow they spied the cause of commotion in the hen-run . They 'd been watching television in the lounge . Muted squawks brought them hurrying into the darkened kitchen . A fox ! Paul was outside in a couple of seconds . Amanda too , and Sarah . The fox forced an exit through loose wire and made off . <p> Summer lay amidst bloodstained feathers . <p> How Amanda shrieked . <p> They bought Bunn at a pet shop . He was a gray Chinchilla  --  and friendly , though with a tendency to nip . <p> Might it have been wiser to take a kitten from a late litter , or a puppy ? No , Amanda insisted . What she had painted must happen . Only then could it stop happening . <p> Paul had looked up cobras in a book at the library . <p> " What you painted could be a King Cobra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head to be positive  --  the hood 's so wide . But it looks to me like a Monocled Cobra . If so , it 's one of the most dangerous snakes in the world . " <p> " But Dad , " insisted Amanda , " it 'll only be a harmless grass snake  --  because there are n't any cobras here ! Mrs. Meadows told me so . Grassy will be the last beast out of the box . Oh you were right about me not needing pets ! But while Bunn 's here we must be kind to him even if he does nip fingers . " <p> The girl was psychologically disturbed . The only way to purge the poison from her system had been to buy Bunn . At least this was a deliberate choice . <p> " It 'll only be a grass snake next , " Amanda persisted . " It 'll come from the brook . Mrs. Meadows said so . We must never ever go on holiday in India  --  " <p> Amanda had n't been to visit the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would her parents have allowed it . Neither Sarah nor Paul could think of a sane way of confronting Mrs. Meadows . What could they possibly say to her ? <p> " It 's Autumn , " said Paul . " All snakes hibernate . Nothing can happen till Spring . " <p> A fortnight later , the fox returned . The wire had been well repaired , and overnight the hutch was always fastened by a hook . <p> Yet the fox burrowed deep under the wire as if digging a den . It nosed the hook out of its slot . <p> Amanda was surprisingly calm . Sarah , less so . <p> " Bring that wretched box from her room , " she ordered Paul . " Amanda ca n't sleep in there with it ! Carry it carefully . We should smash it to pieces . " <p> " But Mum , " protested the girl , " that 's my box . I painted it . Why carry it carefully if you want it smashed ? " <p> " Not in your bedroom I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake ! Then we 'll be all right . " <p> " Shall I bring the box down and nail it shut  --  ? " <p> " The sides are too thin , Dad . Nails would split the wood . " <p> " I 'll tie it tight with garden twine . " <p> " If it 's tied , why ca n't it stay in my room ? That 's where it belongs , do n't you see ? Otherwise , things might n't happen properly  --  not if it 's away from me . You do n't want it here in the kitchen , Mum , or in the lounge , do you ? " <p> " It can go in the garden shed . " <p> In the shed the air would be damp . The lovely ink-work might spoil . Oh no , the box must stay close to Amanda while she was dreaming . By now she seemed on the verge of hysteria or an asthma attack . Paul took a roll of green twine up to her room to tie round the box right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Amanda 's cry brought Paul and Sarah from their bed in their matching paisley pajamas . <p> The sudden flood of electric light revealed Amanda sitting upright . The beast box was shuddering , shifting to and fro . Paul 's knots were slithering slowly open , as though the thinnest of green snakes was wrapped around the box , and now it was untangling itself . How the box rocked . Amanda scrambled along the bed to join her parents . <p> Her father seized a plastic ruler from beside some school books , and brandished it . " A cobra ca n't fit inside ! Maybe a baby one  --  but who 's scared of a baby ? " Could a baby snake make a box lurch so vigorously ? <p> " Dear God , " moaned Sarah . The twine was coming undone . The lid began to lift . <p> " Grassy , " called Amanda . " Come out , Grassy . Be a good snake , now . " <p> Up rose a flared hood . <p> Raised ribs extended the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin tongue flicked in and out . A body resembling a brown bicycle tire began to uncoil from out of the little box , coil after coil appearing . That box ought to have been five times as big to contain so much body . <p> The hood dipped . Briefly they saw a large eye-mark behind the head : the monocle . <p> And snarling ginger fur rushed past Amanda 's legs . Paul cried out loudest in startlement . Bristling fur , claws , bared teeth : a mass collided with the snake . Brown body lashed ; hooded mouth gaped . The cat 's teeth closed on the snake 's neck at the very same time as the snake bit its attacker 's flank . <p> The snake slumped . <p> " Duffy ! " squealed Amanda . Mrs. Meadows ' pet lumbered past her and out of the bedroom . Next thing , Duffy must have tumbled headlong down the stairs . Such a crash . Such a noise of breakage . <p> The cat was n't to be found , but the tripod table at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorian majolica vase filled with teazles and pampas grass to the floor , shattering it . <p> Duffy must have gone out through the cat flap . Barefoot , in their pajamas , the Whitakers hastened into the chill of the night . From around at the front of the house came another sound of something breaking . Flowerpot toppling off a brick , perhaps . They hurried along the side path , the ribbed concrete so cold underfoot . <p> Halfway down Brook Lane , a solitary lamppost shed yellow light . They could see a cat staggering , falling over , pulling itself up again , and lurching onward down the lane . <p> " We 'll catch our deaths , " protested Sarah . <p> Skirting the wreckage of the majolica vase and strewn contents , they ascended cautiously to Amanda 's room . Had they really seen a cobra ? Or had some hysterical folie gripped them ? A shared delusion , which they had been all too prepared to perceive ? <p> On the floor lay an open box and twine and a slim green snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It squirmed in through the flap into the heat of the kitchen , then came upstairs , " declared Paul . " That 's what happened . Do you understand ? " <p> To Amanda , her father seemed unhinged . <p> Amanda said carefully , " I think the real animals killed the dream animals . The Boxer killed Scotty . The fox killed Summer and Bunn . The dream lasted much longer for Duffy because he was Mrs. Meadows ' dream . Duffy must have sensed the cobra coming into existence . Or Mrs. Meadows sensed it . But if her dream 's dead now  --  " <p> " Do n't you talk that way ! " snapped Paul . " You do n't know what you 're saying . " <p> " Tomorrow morning , " persisted Amanda , " will you phone the police and tell them we think Mrs. Meadows is dead in her house because we have n't seen her for such a long time ? You could say we 're worried she 's ill or had a fall . That might sound better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake and folded it into the box where the little pots of paint lay higgledy-piggledy . <p> " We 'd better bury this in the garden beside the others . " She rounded on her parents accusingly . " You do n't seem to know what to do ! I was right about the snake , was n't I ? " <p> " Yes , you were right , " said her father . " It was just a grass snake . " <p> " Mrs. Meadows is gone now . " <p> " What makes you say so ? " <p> " You know it 's true . All the beasts have gone . Will the box rot in the soil ? Do you think in thirty years time , when we are n't living here anymore , a boy or girl might dig the box up ? I think Mrs. Meadows loved me , Dad . " <p> " Not nearly as much as we love you , " said Sarah , tears in her eyes . <p> " I think , " said Amanda , " people live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Mrs. Meadows in his own cat way . But we did n't love her . And Duffy was only her dream , come to life . Then her dream died , saving me . Mum , you and Dad wo n't die as long as I love you . I must n't be angry with you . But people grow up , do n't they ? I 'm never , " she vowed , " going to fall in love with some boy and get married . " <p> " Do you know , " exclaimed Paul , " you have n't had an asthma attack for absolutely ages . " <p> " Mrs. Meadows cured me , Dad . The beasts broke my heart but they cured me . " <p> Already Amanda sounded so grown up ; and therefore such a stranger . <p> <p> By Ian Watson <p> Ian Watson has written a number of short stories since the publication of his latest novel and we were lucky enough to get two of them .
