For more than 30 years , she suffered from bouts of paralyzing depression  --  then a new wonder drug changed her life . <p> In my palm is a green and white capsule , slightly larger than a Tic Tac . Inside is a white powder containing 39 quintillion molecules of something called fluoxetine hydrochloride . When reduced to a diagram on paper , the chemical structure of each molecule resembles a pair of aviator goggles with a broken nosepiece . <p> Once they are in my body , those molecules will migrate to my brain , where they will attach to sites on the ends of nerve cells and prevent them from absorbing a chemical called serotonin . Serotonin is a neurotransmitter , the bicycle courier of the brain , shuttling electrical impulses from one nerve to another . With less serotonin being absorbed , more of it will be pedaling around up there , delivering tiny jolts of electricity from nerve to nerve . You could say this little green and white capsule is about to ratchet up the voltage in my head . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will help me feel better . Happier . Without name- less anxiety , able to take pleasure in ordinary things . Sane . <p> And there lies one of the more intriguing medical controversies of our time . <p> The drug is called Prozac , and since it came on the market in 1988 , it has proven to be a startlingly effective treatment for a common but potentially deadly mental illness known as depression . This year , more than 10 million people around the world will take it , or one of several copycat drugs it has spawned . For Eli Lilly and Company , its manufacturer , Prozac brought in more than $1 million in sales in 1992 , testimony to its broad medical acceptance . <p> Yet something about it seems scary . Almost from the start , Lilly has been dogged by lawsuits claiming that for some vulnerable patients , Prozac triggered homicidal or suicidal impulses . The evidence has yet to convince any court of law , and the medical debate has largely yielded to a disquieting philosophical one . <p> Prozac is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that has come before , because it fundamentally and selectively alters personality without altering perception . And that gives abstract questions some disturbing reality .. By using Prozac are we fiddling with the human soul ? Does its effectiveness mean that we do n't have a soul  --  that the mind is merely a globe of tissue in which electrical and chemical events occur ? Should we indulge in what psychiatrist Peter Kramer , author of the bestseller Listening to Prozac , calls " cosmetic psychopharmacology "  --  tinkering with personalities the way a mechanic fine-tunes a car ? <p> It comes down to this : Who am I ? Am I my unchemical self , no matter how unhappy that may make me ? Or should I swallow this pill , achieve tranquillity , and risk obliterating some essential part of me ? <p> Some consider this a paralyzing moral dilemma . I do n't . For anyone who has ever lived through an episode of major depression , this is a no-brainer . If there is a pill that will make you well , or make it less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My feeling on that point is so strong that I keep taking this pill long after my doctor has said it is okay to quit . If it has n't saved my life , it has profoundly changed it . <p> I pour myself a glass of water , and down it goes . <p> But still  --  there are times when I have the uneasy sense that I am ceding a big part of my autonomy to the pharmaceutical industry . There is the Brave New Worm specter of " soma , " the all-purpose psychic pepper-upper that enabled Huxley 's futuristic government to create a society of compliant plea-sure-seekers . Sometimes I wonder who I would be if I were n't taking Prozac . Maybe I would be a tortured genius , like Byron . Or maybe I would be just me and nasty . With periods of dank despondency . <p> So I 'm left to ponder : Did the person who made this pill have any idea what he was doing ? Did he realize that the promise of surcease from pain would lure millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he think about what he 's done ? <p> Then one day , I decided to find this wizard , whoever he was , and ask him . <p> My search took me to Indianapolis , via ancient Greece . <p> The Greeks knew about depression ; it was for them a well-known array of symptoms , and their name for it can be poetically translated into modern English as " crazy fear . " It 's an apt thumbnail description of a complex illness whose symptoms range from anxiety attacks , inability to concentrate on everyday tasks , irritability , weight loss , and insomnia to its best-known sign : a deep , chronic sense of emptiness and despair <p> The Romans Latinized the Greek word " melancholia , " which in Anglo-Saxon English got translated as " black bile , " one of the four " humors " that made up the medieval concept of the human body . Illness , it was thought , resulted from an imbalance in those humors , and melancholy was due to too much black bile . The French spoke of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the thrall of major depression . <p> For most of recorded medical history , doctors considered depression an illness of the body , and they treated it with purges , blood-letting , and special diets . But it also was seen as an illness of the soul . While some tried exorcism to drive the demons out , Robert Burton 's Anatomy of Melancholy , published in 1621 , counseled sufferers to seek the comforts of " true religion . " <p> With Sigmund Freud came the classic psychoanalytic theories of depression : that it was anger turned inward , the lingering effects of unresolved trauma . For a while , the long shadow of Freud nearly obliterated any idea that this might be a physical abnormality . When that idea reemerged , it came about as scientific breakthroughs often do : by accident . <p> In the 1950s , researchers noticed that an antihistamine new on the market in France , chlorpromazine , helped tame the hallucinations and rages of severely psychotic patients and also helped people suffering from an agitated form of depression . In 1957 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iproniazid , also seemed to help perpetually morose patients recover their old vitality . <p> The observations were noted with interest by drug companies , who sensed a market and leapt into the void . Within a few years , a handful of new antidepressants were on the market . <p> The drugs did work for many people , but the side effects were sometimes debilitating . The antidepressants derived from the tuberculosis drug produced jaundice and high blood pressure ; those derived from antihistamine made patients groggy and dry-mouthed . Some severely depressed people , demoralized by the side effects and tired of waiting for results , opted to use the pills to end their pain another way  --  by downing the whole bottle in one big gulp with , say , a bottle of vodka . <p> This idea  --  that an " imaginary " pain of the mind could drive someone to end his life is a hard one for normal people to grasp . After all , everyone knows what sadness is . And there is grief , a close cousin of depression and a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most difficult tasks of language . Like all mental illness , depression exiles people into a foreign territory of the mind , from where they may or may not be able to send back bulletins . Like dreamers , the mentally ill often find that their return to clarity invokes an automatic amnesia ; those who find their way home from its exile often forget what they saw in that strange land . <p> As for me , I not only made repeat trips , I kept a travel diary . <p> Mockingbird , singing in the dead of night . <p> Sometimes , in the South , mockingbirds get crazed . They sing all night . This one did , anyway , right outside my window . After a while , I was sure he was mocking me  --  flaunting his music in the sticky-warm night air , reminding me that it was 4:00 a.m. and that I had not slept for hours , that soon I would have to get up and face another day of deadening duties and crushing sadness . Exhausted but wide awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of me to remember why I was sad . I was 20 . <p> I was in college then and keeping my journal , the same one I had begun six years before . By then , it filled up dozens of spiral-bound notebooks , as well as an immense leather-bound ledger I had found in my mother 's basement . The journal was my way of trying to make sense of the times when The Beast , as I came to call it , came calling . <p> The Beast was a familiar visitor , though I do n't recall precisely when it first arrived . I can remember as a child  --  memory places it at around fourth grade  --  crouching behind a toilet in the girls ' lavatory , unable to explain why I was there and just wordlessly sad . Depression is a disorder that tends to recur and to get worse if left untreated , and mine was a classic case : As I went through my teens and 20s , I suffered roughly a half-dozen episodes , lasting from a few months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . The Beast prompted me to start my journal , the winter I was 14 . <p> I have it before me now , that first ledger  --  a green stenographer 's notebook , filled with my loopy adolescent script . <p> " It sounds horrible , and it is , " I wrote on page two , " but several times lately I have thought about how nice it would be to kill myself ! ! ! " <p> In that mockingbird spring of my 20th year , The Beast came for its first extended visit . It sat on my chest at night ; it rode my back during the day . A half-dozen spiral notebooks later , I would write in my journal : <p> " My face is wet . My hands are icy  --  I notice these things one at a time , gradually , like an infant . I am cold . Inside , I am a battlefield  --  Waterloo after Napoleon , Vicksburg after the siege . . . . Always a war ; always fighting one emotion or another . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness at the core of everything , everything , and on afternoons like this I feel it most . I am empty inside . There is something in the future which is coming . . . . I am afraid that it will suck out my core and I will be completely empty and anguished . " <p> And : " I have to find ways to get myself through it , people I love who will help me . . . . I have to because the alternative is simply existing , crawling in a corner to die . Or going over the edge into madness . " <p> Throughout that spring and the year that followed , I felt myself leaving the people I loved . They stood on the shore , growing smaller and indistinct , as I drifted away on a reluctant journey . I felt trapped in an invisible , airless chamber , my frantic gestures ignored or misunderstood . I would sit alone in my dorm room , listening for hours to the violin countermelody , so full of longing and wordless grief , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , I merely seemed remote and angry . <p> After many months , the episode ended as imperceptibly as it had begun . But there would be others . In college , I found a psychotherapist , and eventually I tried anti-depressants . But I did n't know what they were , and my doctors did n't seem to , either , since they prescribed them only at my request , and at first in doses too small to do me any good . Not surprisingly , the relief I got from them was fleeting . And there were months , even years , when The Beast stayed away . <p> It was not until 1990 that I tried Prozac . I had been on vacation with friends on Cape Cod . It was August , six months after I had been hospitalized for the most severe episode of depression yet , and I still was n't well . <p> After a week at the beach , a sudden panic at the approach of my 35th birthday made me bolt ; to the bafflement of my friends , I rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I checked into a motel and spent one of the worst nights of my life , staring at my bottle of imipramine  --  a favorite drug among depressives who kill themselves  --  and wondering if The Beast had won after all , if the moment had come to negotiate a surrender . <p> In the morning , taking the urgent advice of my psychiatrist and a friend , I caught a plane to Washington . A prescription for Prozac was waiting for me at my neighborhood drugstore . <p> Two days later , I was at home when I had a moment of what I can only call clearheadedness . The suffocating anxiety was gone , momentarily , and I felt a deep relief , a sense of sudden calm after cons of warfare inside my head . I had gotten so used to the noise that the quiet was unfamiliar . It was as if the evil person who had been holding my head under water , trying to drown me , had suddenly let go . I picked up the phone and called a friend . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " but I think I 'm starting to feel better . " <p> My recovery was not that dramatic , of course ; there were several weeks in which I still found it hard to concentrate or sleep , and in which the daily weight of sadness seemed too much to drag around with me . But by October , I definitely knew : I was better . I have been taking Prozac ever since . I am , you might say , chemically altered . <p> Exactly what form this alteration has taken , I will never know . In the bad old days , I did n't always know I was depressed until somebody told me , the way people with leprosy sometimes did n't notice their deterioration until they scalded their hand and it did n't hurt . I can no more describe how that has changed than I can examine the back of my own neck . I do n't feel sedated , or jittery , or drugged . I simply feel . . . normal . As if I had been driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now it is off . I feel as if the real me has returned  --  perhaps all the way from childhood , where she lived before The Beast arrived . Sometimes I sense that I have lost something . An intensity of feeling , maybe  --  a way of noticing the world with wonder . It is a perspective I now find hard to summon . Those instants are Kodachromed in my mind , like one moment from that mockingbird year when I saw a poplar tree in the rain , its yellow leaves falling on the wet pavement , and glimpsed an indescribable sad beauty . I do n't have those moments much anymore ; they have mostly all gone , along with most of those moments of lacerating despair . I have greedily swapped them for ordinary life . That may sound dull , but I tell you it is sweet . It is not caviar I crave , but clean sheets and hot soup . <p> At some point , the thought came to me that few people have affected my life quite as profoundly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him that , whoever and wherever he was . Which is how I came to be in Indiana , to find the Wizard of Prozac . Hemight have no idea of what he 'd done , I thought , but I imagined he would like to hear from me . <p> I fear I have always tended to romanticize things . * <p> The pale pink marble of Eli Lilly 's corporate headquarters rises Ozlike out of the flat Indiana farmland . Inside , the atmosphere is something between a temple and a theme park . Three-story ceilings loom over a silver and marble lobby and the comings and goings of people who  --  as it seems to me  --  stride past with a sense of high purpose . <p> Through one of the huge lobby windows , I glimpse an immaculate green field with flowers that look so perfect they must be plastic , except they are n't . <p> Inside is a 90-acre complex of offices and laboratories . Walking through one of the labs , I stumble on a disconcerting sight  --  a row of live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice pitchers , tail feathers sticking up like paper umbrellas in a row of mai tais . <p> The Lilly public relations department has scheduled an exhaustive tour , the highlight of which is to be my meeting with the Prozac scientists . <p> The wizard I seek , as it turns out , is not one person , but three : Ray Fuller , David Wong , and Bryan Molloy . They are the men collecting awards these days  --  but even that is an arbitrarily short list . I am informed that hundreds of people at Lilly worked on the Prozac project over a span of 18 years . The era of solitary Pasteurs puttering up miracles in their basements is as dead as the Model T. Because pharmaceutical industry profits often hinge on who gets there first , when a goal seems within reach , vast teams are thrown at projects . <p> Fuller and Wong seem much alike , even though Fuller is a farm boy from southern Illinois and Wong is a native of Hong Kong . Both are unassuming middle-aged men who convey a genial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or small-town family doctors . <p> Molloy is different : Quirky , irascible , he keeps to himself in offices clear on the other side of the Lilly complex . He has a gaunt , angular face and a discernible trace of Scotland in his speech , and he seems intense , at home between his own two ears and impatient with social niceties . <p> Lining the walls of his office is a series of world maps , growing smaller in scope and more detailed until , on the far wall , there is a sewer commission map of Molloy 's native village in Scotland . It even shows alleys and car parks . <p> Molloy gives me an abbreviated version of how Prozac was developed , a story that sounds self-evident in hindsight , as major discoveries often do . <p> The idea was simple : Instead of examining existing drugs to discover which ones had antidepressant side effects , Molloy decided to start with the side effect and build a drug that would trigger it . It was the scientific method in reverse  --  as if Molloy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first chapter . The mystery became not whodunit , but how they did it and why . <p> Molloy started in 1971 with a trip to Lilly 's chemical library , the vast catalogue of compounds the company kept in its vaults for research . Antihistamines had yielded the first major antidepressant drugs , so Molloy started with compounds whose chemical structures resembled antihistamines . He began carting books listing compounds over to his office by the wheelbarrow load . <p> He knew which neurotransmitters he wanted to leave alone  --  the ones that produced the grogginess and dry-mouth effects , among others  --  but he was not sure which ones he wanted to target . Several years before , he and Fuller had collaborated on research involving serotonin , and Fuller was by this point convinced that serotonin was the key to understanding the faulty brain chemistry that results in severe depression . * <p> It was Wong who supplied the last , crucial link in the developmental chain by creating a precise test for measuring the effect of serotonin in living brain cells , using ground-up brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; less than two years after Molloy started , Wong 's tests confirmed that one compound Molloy and Fuller had created , known as LY949439 , had a potent and selective effect on serotonin , and serotonin only . This was Prozac. * <p> " Dr. Fuller and I were reminiscing one day , " says Wong , " and we both decided that if we had not become scientists , we might have wound up in the seminary . " <p> It is an incongruous thought . If your work is based on the certainty that mind and body are indistinguishable , where does a spiritual view of the universe fit in ? Is n't there some sort of a logical inconsistency ? <p> * <p> " People talk about depression as if it 's either-or , " Fuller said . It is not as simple , he said , as mind or body . " I do n't think that distinction has any meaning . The mind , like the rest of the body , functions through molecular changes . " <p> He is talking in his office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical data . At times , he gets up to illustrate some point with a diagram of a neuron , pointing to it with a pencil as if he were lecturing in a classroom . A few weeks after Prozac went on the market in 1988 , he was in Boston at a scientific conference , riding an escalator in a hotel , when he overheard two women behind him talking . " I 'm on Prozac now , and I 'm doing much better , " one woman said to the other . Telling the story makes him smile , which makes him look very much like a Presbyterian minister . <p> Except that in his theology , the soul is a collection of cells , if a dauntingly complex one . ( " If the human brain were simple enough for us to understand , we would be too simple to understand it , " another Lilly pharmacologist said in Listening to Prozac . ) Fuller quotes one of his scientific predecessors , neuroscientist Ralph Gerard : " Behind every crooked thought , there lies a crooked molecule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves to think that we are able to reason our way out of despair ? Is there a chemical for every sadness ? <p> No , he says , but every sadness is chemical . There was an experiment in which damsel fish were kept in a tank with only a transparent wall between them and some big predator fish . The damselfish had every reason to think they were about to be eaten . After a while , the serotonin levels in their brains showed a marked decrease . It 's illustrative , in a crude way , he says . Loss , anxiety , repeated rejection- " things we experience do cause neuro-chemical changes in the brain . " <p> And so it is that the pharmacological effects of fluoxetine hydrochloride , properly administered , modify the chemistry of the neuronal synapse to cause the following physical occurrence every Sunday at a certain church in Indianapolis : A woman who used to be clinically depressed walks up to Ray Fuller and hugs his neck . * <p> The most important question , the question I had come here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Molloy who started everything 20 years ago . <p> How does it make you feel , I ask , to know that what you have done has helped people ? To know that this molecule you invented has allowed me to live my life in a way I never thought possible ? <p> There is an awkward pause . <p> " I am not a touchy-feely person , " Molloy says uncomfortably , almost sourly . We are sitting in his office , and he has turned his face slightly away from me . <p> " I 'm happy for you , okay ? " He clearly wishes I were not there , asking this sentimental , unscientific question . <p> " This puts me in a somewhat embarrassing position , " Molloy says . He glances at the public relations person for Eli Lilly who has accompanied me to this interview . What comes out , finally , is so stunningly honest that I do not know what to say , and so I say nothing . <p> " The company puts itself in the position of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here saying I did n't do it for that . I just wanted to do it for the intellectual high . <p> " It looked , " he said , " like scientific fun . " <p> Reality is rarely what we imagine . Demons do not inhabit our bodies ; the heart is not the seat of human emotion ; black bile does not make us sad . Great and noble things do not always happen for great and noble reasons . <p> I can live with that . Happily ever after . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Researchers Bryan Molloy and Ray Fuller discovered serotonin was the key to depression .
