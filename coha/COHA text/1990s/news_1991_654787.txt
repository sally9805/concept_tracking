<p> KING Hussein 's bitter criticism of the United States Gulf policy last week reflects Jordanian apprehension over a postwar US-imposed regional order that might exclude Jordan and a settlement for the Palestinian problem , according to well-informed analysts here . <p> " It was a message that the US can not impose a new world order , involving a new setup in the region , that will serve American interests at the expense of Arab interests and aspirations , " says a former Jordanian official , who asks not to be named . <p> King Hussein 's speech accused the US and the coalition forces of deliberately and systematically destroying Iraq . It also expressed increasing Jordanian suspicions , both official and popular , that Washington is ready to write off Jordan once the Gulf war is over . <p> Analysts and well-placed Jordanian sources say they believe there are people in Washington who entertain the idea of wiping Jordan off the political map . Alternatives favored by some circles in Washington , they say , might be to use the nation as a homeland for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Saudi Arabia . <p> In his Feb. 6 speech , the king accused the coalition forces of planning to divide the " spoils " of the war once the current massive confrontation is over . <p> The charges drew an angry reaction from the US administration , which accused Jordan of abandoning its neutrality and moving over to the Iraqi camp . <p> But Middle East experts in Washington disagree with the Jordanian charge . Although Jordan might suffer in the short term , they say , the country remains crucial to regional stability , from the US viewpoint . <p> " There is a war mentality of ' who is not with us is against us , " ' says Helena Cobban of the Brookings Institute in Washington . " But there are many many people who appreciate Jordan as a buffer and , when they think calmly about the region , they realize that it will be much more chaotic without Jordan . " <p> IN Jordan , however , there is a growing feeling that US decisionmakers do not take the politics of the region , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only see American interests when they talk about a new world order , " says a Jordanian analyst close to the government . " What they ignore is that there is a discrepancy between preserving the American way of life and the welfare of people in the region . " <p> Furthermore , Jordanians believe there have always been decisionmakers in Washington who favor the idea of substituting a Palestinian state for Jordan , even when King Hussein was on good terms with the US . <p> " In 1970 ( when the Jordanian Army clashed with the Palestine Liberation Organization ) , we knew that in the first week of the ( civil ) war , there were some in Washington who were pressing for writing Jordan off , " says a former Jordanian official , who held an important post at that time . <p> Mistrust of US intentions toward Jordan has been intensified by economic pressures from the US and Saudi Arabia - the kingdom 's two main financial backers - following King Hussein 's refusal to join the US-led anti-Iraqi coalition . <p> For its part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Aqaba to prevent imports from getting to Iraq . But Jordanian shipping and official sources say the blockade strangled the port - even before the war began Jan. 16 - obstructing the country 's trade with the world . <p> Jordanians were also stunned by what they see as an unexpected and uncharacteristic Saudi vindictiveness in response to Jordan 's position . Riyadh has not only expelled Jordanian diplomats , but has cut off its oil supplies to Jordan , prohibited the reshipment of Jordan-bound goods that could not make their way to Aqaba , and effectively prevented any trade with Jordan . <p> The Saudi measures sparked angry demonstrations near the Syria borders last week , when the residents of Ramtha attacked Syrian and Turkish trucks loaded with goods and food supplies for Saudi Arabia . Some of the trucks carried food and alcohol to the coalition forces stationed in Saudi Arabia , according to Jordanian parliamentarians . <p> The government had to impose a partial curfew and to briefly detain more than 80 protesters to ensure the free passage of the trucks to Saudi Arabia . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalized for its refusal to join the coalition against Iraq : the bombing of Jordanian trucks carrying oil supplies from Iraq ( despite United Nations permission for Jordan to get Iraqi oil ) and calls in Washington for a review of the annual $50 million to $55 million in foreign aid . <p> Information Minister Ibrahim Izz al-Din denies that Jordan has become an all-out supporter of Iraq , but says US pressure will not prompt Jordan to change its position toward the Gulf crisis . <p> " There is indeed a definite change in language and tone of our approach , " he says . " That is because of the new fact : the destruction of an Arab country , Iraq . " <p> " But there is no shift whatsoever in our policy and principled approach to the Gulf crisis , " Mr. Izz al-Din says . Although Jordan has strongly opposed and condemned the coalition forces bombardment of Iraq , it supports the full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions calling for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait . <p> " We still have the Kuwaiti Embassy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Jordanians think Washington is deliberately misinterpreting Jordan 's position to pave the way for the kingdom 's demise . <p> " If they really entertain such ideas , they will find Jordan a tougher nut to crack that they think , " a Jordanian official says . <p> Analysts and officials say that King Hussein is mainly depending on the support of his people and the solid national unity , which has emerged as a result of the democratization process that was launched 16 months ago . <p> " The democratization process is Jordan 's safety valve , " says a Jordanian official , reflecting widespread suspicion that the US might encourage internal disruption of national unity as a way to undermine the country 's sovereignty after or even during the war . <p> But US experts on the Middle East deny that the US or coalition forces will seek to undermine King Hussein 's regime or will react with vengeance toward Jordan . <p> " I do not think that the US and its allies will be vindictive against Jordan , " says William Quandt from the Brookings Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once the war is over . <p> " There are no alternative in Jordan for his ( King Hussein 's ) leadership , " he says . <p> But from the Jordanian viewpoint , according to analysts and sources close to the government , the most frustrating element is that Jordan and the Arabs are being asked to accept a postwar regional order about which they have not been consulted . <p> " What we are trying to say is that the US might win the war , but it will not win peace , " the former Jordanian official says . <p> " We shall not accept the US imposing its new world order upon us.
