A pair of Full Moons turns June blue , a pair of bright comets calls Sagittarius home , and a pair of planets have satellites that bear watching . // Highlights by Rick Shaffer // The month of June begins - and ends with a Full Moon . At sunset on June 1 , it rises above the trees like a yellow Chinese lantern in the eastsoutheast . The June Full Moon is called variously the Rose Moon , Flower Moon , or Strawberry Moon ( take your pick ) . Then on June 30 , another Full Moon graces the east-southeastern sky at sunset . This Moon , the second Full Moon of the month , also has a name : " Blue Moon . " True to its name , Blue Moons do n't occur often - on average once every 2.72 years . Not everyone on Earth experiences a Blue Moon this month . If we synchronize our watches to Universal Time - the mean solar time in Greenwich , England - then the second Full Moon of June actually occurs on July 1 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is , however , a fourhour time difference now between Greenwich and the east coast of the United States . Thus , when it 's 3:58 a.m. in Greenwich , clocks on the east coast read 11:58 p.m . Eastern Daylight Time on June 30 . Two minutes is two minutes , and in this case , it buys the States a true Blue Moon in June ! Turning to planets , you may be able to catch Venus very low in the west-northwest just after sunset . Look now if you want to see it . Venus disappears early this month , hurrying to meet its appointment with the Sun on June 10 . It then returns to the morning sky , low in the east-northeast , in the final two weeks of June . The only other solar system object in the early evening sky at the start of June requires a telescope to be seen . Not quite two weeks past opposition , Pluto lies in far western Ophiuchus and is well placed for those up to the challenge of searching for this remote object . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month 's issue of ASTRONOMY . Shining through the dusk a half-hour after sunset in early June , yellowish Procyon in Canis Minor the Lesser Dog marks cardinal west . To its right ( north ) , we see Gemini the Twins alighting upright on the western horizon . The two brightest stars of this zodiacal group lie side by side in the sky . They are Castor on the right and Pollux on the left . Castor is a beautiful binary system consisting of 2nd- and 3rdmagnitude stars that are easily visible in a small scope at high power . Northwest of Gemini lies dazzling Capella in Auriga the Charioteer , scintillating like a windblown candle flame . At magnitude 0.08 , Capella ranks as the brightest star in this corner of the sky . In this case , however , brightness does not denote nearness . Of the four stars mentioned , Procyon is the nearest at a mere 11 lightyears , while Capella lies 42 light-years away . Overhead , the stars of spring appear reluctant to shuffle off the seasonal stage , even with the summer solstice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . By month 's end , however , this diffidence will be overcome as Leo decisively begins its long , head-first dive toward the west , with Virgo trailing after . But early in the month , Spica does n't even cross the north-south line dividing the sky ( the meridian ) until nearly 10 o'clock . Above and to the left of Spica beams orange Arcturus , brightest star in the northern night sky . It is outshone only by Sirius , Canopus , and Alpha Centauri in all the nocturnal heavens . To the northnortheast extends its kiteshaped grouping , Bootes the Herdsman . At least two other planets lie in the evening sky , though they are invisible to all but sensitive professional instruments . And even then , they can only be " seen " indirectly by their subtle gravitational tugs on their parent stars ' apron strings . The 5th-magnitude Sun-like star 70 Virginis , which lies about halfway between Eta ( eta ) Bootis and Epsilon ( epsilon ) Virginis , harbors a planet more massive than six Jupiters . And in Ursa Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planet at least 2.3 times Jupiter 's mass . This star , also similar in class to the Sun , lies a little over 4deg. south-southwest of 3rdmagnitude Psi ( psi ) Ursae Majoris . Follow the Dipper 's pointer stars in the direction opposite that of the North Star to lead you to 47 UMa . Farther east we finally enter the domain of the summer sky . Leading the way is the constellation Hercules , son of Zeus . At 10 p.m. look for his distinctive , trapezoidal " keystone " asterism about 50deg. above the eastern horizon . Once you find this asterism , you can easily pick out the rest of the constellation : his upper torso stretching to the south , his legs nearly touching the northern circumpolar groups . If you have a telescope , aim it just to the right of Eta ( eta ) Herculis , the northwestern star in the keystone . That cottony spot of light you see is the glow of a million stars making up globular cluster M13 , one of the finest deep-sky objects in the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallmark stars of summer : The brightest one , Vega in Lyra the Lyre , precedes Deneb in Cygnus the Swan and Altair in Aquila the Eagle . Running through these groups is the summer Milky Way . Follow its chalky white path south into Scorpius , which by 11 p.m. lies mostly above the horizon . Not far behind is Sagittarius with our first bright planet of the late evening , Jupiter . Early in the month , Jupiter clears the horizon a little before 11 p.m. , but you wo n't see it until it climbs above the trees , probably an hour or so later . Next month , on July 4 , Jupiter comes to opposition , when it rises at sunset and remains visible all night . Trailing just behind Jupiter are two outer planets , Uranus and Neptune . Both lie a little west of the " smile in the sky , " as Capricornus the Sea Goat is sometimes referred to , with Neptune just over the border in eastern Sagittarius . Binoculars allow you to easily pick out Uranus as a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neptune , however , provides more of a challenge . Although you can spot it with binoculars , you wo n't be able to see its blue-green color unless you use a telescope . Rising a couple of hours after midnight , and still three months away from opposition , is Saturn . The viewing window at the beginning of the month is narrow - between about 3 a.m. local time and dawn . Conditions improve slightly by June 30 , when Saturn rises at about 1 a.m. among the background stars of Cetus . Although not considered a zodiacal constellation , Cetus becomes one by proxy when a planet cuts through the constellation south of the ecliptic line , as Saturn is doing now . Displayed in all its glory above Saturn in the morning sky is Pegasus the Winged Horse and its central anchor of four stars , the Great Square . The horse 's nose , denoted by the star Enif , stretches to the west , where it almost nuzzles against Equuleus the Lesser Horse , a faint and insignificant constellation of five main stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , whose brightest member shines at only 4th magnitude . Look for it with binoculars between Enif and the tadpole-like constellation , Delphinus the Dolphin . The creator of Equuleus , the second-smallest constellation in the sky , is unknown , although it appears on Ptolemy 's original list of 48 constellations compiled in the second century . Ian Ridpath , in his book Star Tales , suggests that Ptolemy may have had the little horse in mind in the story of Hippe , daughter of Chiron the centaur . Hippe was seduced by Aeolus , Greek god of the wind . To hide her pregnancy from her father she fled to the mountains , where she eventually gave birth to Melanippe . When Chiron came looking for her , Hippe implored the gods to hide her . They obliged by changing her into a mare and placing her among the stars where she hides still , with only her head showing . To the northeast , scrutinize the region between Alpha ( alpha ) and Beta ( beta ) Pegasi for 5th-magnitude 51 Pegasi , home star to yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two planets in our solar system , Mars and Mercury , rise about an hour before the Sun . Firstmagnitude Mars is climbing slowly out of the twilight glare and can be glimpsed about 50 directly above brilliant Venus on June 25 and 26 . Meanwhile Mercury puts in its worst morning apparition of the year for Northern Hemisphere observers . At greatest elongation on June 10 , it lies just 6deg high in the east-northeast , below and to the right of slightly fainter Mars . Author Affiliation Jeff Kanipe is ASTRONOMY S managing editor .
