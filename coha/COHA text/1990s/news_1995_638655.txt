<p> Grazing bill called ' bad law ' and ' vital ' for the West <p> Reading your Aug. 13 editorial , headlined " Domenici 's grazing bill fosters better stewardship , " it was hard to believe that it 's the same bill that " would set back public rangeland management 50 years , " according to acting Bureau of Land Management Director Mike Dombeck . <p> And the criticism of S. 852 is not coming just from " some Eastern-based environmental groups , " as your editorial suggests . Writing in High Country News , Paul Larmer notes that , " Domenici 's bill prevents the BLM from curtailing grazing unless it can show " imminent and irreversible damage to the land . " <p> The last time I checked , " irreversible " meant something pretty permanent . It 's a bit late for discipline at that point . <p> Larmer goes on to write that the bill " would also let ranchers hold on to permits even if they prevent public access to their allotment , fail to pay grazing fees , illegally kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , that 's some idea of stewardship . <p> Your point that legislated law is preferable to administrative mandate is well taken . But even bad law ? Better to operate under Bruce Babbitt 's Rangeland Reform ' 94 regulations - culled from two years ' worth of meetings involving thousands of concerned citizens , including ranchers and conservationists - until legislation that truly does foster stewardship is proposed . Or better yet , use Babbitt 's well-reasoned reforms as the basis for that legislation . <p> DAVID SEPPA <p> Denver <p> I am writing to call your attention to legislation being considered in the U.S. Congress - the Livestock Grazing Act . Passage of this bill is of vital importance to all of us in the Western ranching industry , to my hometown of Walden and other Western communities . Now is the time to resolve chronic fights over federal grazing ; the Livestock Grazing Act is an equitable way to do so . <p> The act will increase revenues for the federal government when budget dollars are few and far between . The bill implements a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair return to the taxpayer for forage consumed by livestock . Compared to the latest figures , the new formula would increase grazing fees by 30 percent . <p> The act will also take into account the environmental health of our public lands , which has been improving steadily for the past 100 years . By cutting bureaucratic requirements , both Bureau of Land Management officials and ranchers can spend less time doing paperwork and more time out in the field assessing the health of the range . Passage of the law will give producers an assurance that they will actually be in business in the future and a reason to engage in long-term range improvement . <p> Economic stability is a major factor in this issue - and not just for ranchers . Without this bill , many bankers will consider Western livestock producers too great a financial risk for operating loans . Ranching on federal lands has always been a part of the North Park area where my family has ranched for generations , and without that benefit many who ranch here would have to reduce our operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local businesses which depend on our support . <p> The time to act is now . <p> All parties to the federal lands debate , including President Clinton , must be ready to put this issue to rest . <p> LUCY MEYRING , rancher <p> Walden <p> Tobacco use is a plague for our youth <p> Two papers and two different editorials on underage smoking . The Rocky Mountain News , in its typical pro-tobacco editorial , did it again on Aug. 14 with this headline : " Tackling teen smoking . Our View : Tackle teen smoking , but not the First Amendment . " <p> The Post ? The first sentence in its editorial the same day , " President Clinton tries to snuff out a killer " : " President Clinton 's efforts to curb teenage smoking , if they survive the ferocious legal and lobbying counterattack from the tobacco industry , may prove to be the most important public health achievement of the post-World War II era . <p> Quite a difference ! The Post ends its editorial " in a generation or two , the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be relegated to the ash tray of history . " It is n't going to happen as long as the tobacco industry writes editorials for compliant papers . Now I remember why I canceled my Rocky subscription and switched to The Post ! Smoking kills . <p> HENRY MONDRAGON <p> Littleton <p> The recent effort in Washington by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine is an important attempt to dislodge the grip of the tobacco industry on our nation 's young people . <p> As a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist in Denver , I am very concerned with the health of our nation 's youth . We need to focus media attention on the fact that tobacco use is a pediatric disease . Over 90 percent of the people who use tobacco began as teenagers . Although many teenagers try it first for curiosity or status , it rapidly becomes a habit that ca n't be kicked . In fact , most teenagers who smoke say they do n't plan to be smokers five years later , but almost all of them still are . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies advertise their products so that tobacco users appear sexy , slim , independent , " cool " and macho . They strategically plan to entice young people to begin tobacco use . They need to , because more than 1,000 tobacco users die every day and must be replaced by new , young smokers and chewers . And it works . Studies show that a third of Colorado high school students are already smokers . <p> There is a mountain of scientific and clinical research that proves beyond a doubt that nicotine is addictive , and that tobacco causes severe health problems , including heart disease , lung disease , respiratory and ear infections and cancer . The American Academy of Pediatrics , which represents 48,000 of this nation 's pediatricians dedicated to the health of our youth , has joined numerous other health agencies in calling for measures to control tobacco use by children and teens . <p> Physicians can individually educate and counsel their young patients about the dangers of tobacco use . At our Adolescent Clinic at the Sandos Westside Health Center ( Denver Health &; Hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoking cessation . But the greatest impact will be through political action . We must support legislation that will promote a smoke-free environment in all public places , ban the advertisement of tobacco products , eliminate cigarette vending machines , increase tobacco taxes and eliminate federal subsidies to tobacco growers . <p> Parents , grandparents , teachers - anyone whose life is touched by a child - should urge President Clinton and Congress to support the FDA 's plan to regulate tobacco advertising and sales to minors . It is time for an all-out assault on industry advertising which dishonestly portrays its products as clean , wholesome and " All-American . " Hopefully , members of this community will add their support to help limit the number of our young people who begin a lifetime of addiction with that first puff or chew . <p> ROBERTA K. BEACH , MD <p> Sandos Westside Health Center , Denver <p> There is strong scientific and clinical research that proves beyond a doubt that nicotine is addictive , and that other ingredients in smoked and smokeless tobacco cause severe health problems , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cancer . <p> The vast majority of people who use tobacco begin as teenagers , and it rapidly becomes a habit they ca n't break . As a pediatrician in Denver , it is my hope that members of this community will join in urging Congress to regulate tobacco because of the addictive properties of nicotine . <p> DONALD W. SCHIFF , M.D. <p> Past President <p> American Academy of Pediatrics <p> It 's time the largest , and unfortunately the quietest , minority group in the United States voices its outrage against the latest administration attack against the tobacco industry . If you smoke or own a business that derives income from the sale of cigarettes , it 's time to let our elected officials know that more quasi-governmental control over the sale and enjoyment of cigarettes is not needed and will not be tolerated . <p> The ruse being used this time is that tobacco companies are vultures descending on America 's children . If that were true , why did Philip Morris initiate " Action Against Access , " a program designed to assist and educate retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Clinton and the Food and Drug Administration determined that the tobacco industry is public enemy No. 1 ? <p> I am a smoker , and I will not be quiet any longer . <p> We do n't need any further governmental control over our lives . <p> JAMES CLAYTON <p> Durango <p> Enforcing registration <p> could bring state revenue <p> My daughter and I began noticing a lot of expired stickers on license plates last year and made a game of it , writing down the plates of expired license plates on our way to soccer practice 17 miles each way into Denver . Our informal survey showed Texans are by far are the greatest offenders , since we saw absolutely no current sticker on their plates , indicating that they would be expired in their own state ! We contacted the Texas Department of Transportation on the Internet , but got no response . Perhaps they have a different system , using no stickers ? <p> We really wanted to be educated on procedures in Texas . Californians were found to have a few expired stickers , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a California sticker says May , you are expired in May . There is no grace period ! ) . Coloradans are pretty good about paying their taxes ( or stealing current ones ! ) My point is that the man who wrote a letter to The Post and wanted offenders to pay their fair share , is correct about this . There is something rotten in Colorado , when so many " visitors " have expired plates . Perhaps the Colorado State Patrol could help out with this , and make Colorado some money so we can fix our roads ! <p> SUE COLE <p> Littleton <p> Facts do n't fit theory <p> in editorial on veto <p> Your editorial , " House GOP hypocrisy stalls line-item veto , " as usual shows your bias . You stated that the Senate voted 83-14 to pass the line-item veto , with 45 Republicans joining Senate Democrats in approving the bill . Simple arithmetic tells me that if 45 of the 54 Republicans voted for the bill , then only 38 of the 46 Democrats voted for it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the Democrats voting in favor . The line should therefore have read as follows : " Thirty-eight Democrats joined Senate Republicans in approving that sense-of-the-Senate resolution " However , if it had been reported this way , your attempt at vilifying the Republicans and the entire point of your editorial would have been destroyed . <p> It never ceases to amaze me on how this newspaper gets so wrapped up in its own agenda that it fails to recognize that the facts do n't fit its theory . <p> GREG BRICE <p> Denver <p> Waco raid would appear <p> to be a PR effort <p> What is The Post 's excuse for that smug , superficial Aug. 3 editorial concerning the House Waco hearings ? Would you have us believe that conducting a bungled raid on a child molester absolves the BATF of all other sins and responsibilities ? If Vernon Howell had n't been a child molester , would you have found some other apology ? <p> Nothing about the Waco hearings dissuades me from the belief that the BATF conducted the raid largely as a public relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CBS 's " 60 Minutes " that it allowed the harassment and assault of its own female agents . It invited the press to the ball , with cameras rolling , and the press managed to leak the news to the Davidians , precipitating the disaster . <p> You and your ilk have made clear to me the definition of a " paranoid extremist " - it 's anyone who wo n't put on liberal blinders . <p> DONALD L. BAKER <p> Fort Collins <p> Rosen raps ADA again <p> There goes Mike Rosen ( July 14 ) bashing the Americans with Disabilities Act again . Taking a few isolated cases , he distorts and exaggerates to create misconceptions and anxiety about the ADA . According to the latest Louis Harris survey , ( May ' 95 ) , 70 percent of corporate executives think the ADA should not be changed . <p> Now that Laura Hershey 's monthly column has been erased from the Editorial Page , there 's no reasoned voice to counter Rosen 's anti-disability tirades . <p> ROBIN STEPHENS <p> Atlantis Community <p> Denver
