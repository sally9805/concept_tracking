People think outfitters have it made . Outside all the time . Hunting every day . Away from the nine-to-five pressure . How hard can it be ? Think again . Clients paying big bucks and traveling across the country expect the hunt of a lifetime . They hold guides accountable for advice , adventure , local history , biology , inspiration , funny stories , three squares a day , and above all , results . When your livelihood depends on success , you 'd better be good . And guides spend so much time outdoors  --  every morning before dawn , all fall , in rain , snow , or otherwise  --  that they ca n't help but learn shortcuts . They know the land so well , and can sense such subtle signs , that they can predict the animals ' next movements ; they almost know their thoughts . Their clients are with them for only a short time  --  each second has been paid for and no one can afford to come up empty . Every little trick helps . To uncover their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule deer , and elk guides across the country . Some of their tactics may sound familiar , many are sure to be new , and some might even strike you as crazy . But they work . Just ask Maryann Georges ... WHITETAILS Around the Country Georges was a client of outfitter Larry Hanold for a whitetail hunt in Illinois last year . Hanold told her to sit with her back against a tree at a corner of a ridgetop cornfield . Arriving at the site the next morning , Maryann 's husband , Nick , checked out the open area . " You ca n't hunt deer here , " he said . " The bucks are in the ravines . In the cover . " " This is where Larry told me to sit , so I 'm staying , " Maryann said . Later , when several does ran across the field 20 yards away , she raised her shotgun in time to shoot the massive buck trailing them . The nontypical scored 182-5/8 Boone and Crockett Club points . That evening Nick quietly went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think I should go in the morning ? " Hanold operates Hunting Unlimited in Mount Sterling , Illinois , and over the last nine years his clients have taken 93 bucks of eight points or better . Like all good whitetail guides , he instructs his clients to hunt edges where one type of habitat abuts another . But although his land has plenty of woodlots and thickets , he focuses on funnels along field edges between bucks ' bedding and feeding areas . " Most clients want to get way back in the woods . But around here bucks travel along field edges , or just two to three yards inside the brush . All they have to do is look into the fields and see what 's around them . If they 're skirting a ridge they 'll walk where their outline is blocked but they can still look over the crest . " It was as if Hanold had drawn a map for Maryann 's deer to follow . It crossed the narrow cornfield just below a slope that hid the corner from the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise . Despite the open land , Hanold knew that this dip in the cornfield created a funnel the deer felt safe using . The whitetails in Hanold 's area are keenly aware of hunting pressure , which his tactics take into account . Hanold says the deer are alert to hunters in tree stands , so he posts most gun hunters on the ground . Tree stands are used for bowhunting , but extreme care is taken in their placement and use . " I 've got 50 permanent tree stands on 1,800 acres . The deer know where they are and stay clear of them ; so I tell bowhunting clients to set up portable stands 75 yards away from the permanent ones so they can catch bucks skirting them . But portables should only stay in one spot for a day or two . Most deer catch on fast : After two days they wo n't be anywhere in sight . " Hanold lies his hunters to stay put all day , because , he says , they spread scent when they enter and leave a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. than at any other time . The reason , Hanold says , is because bucks breed throughout the night , so around midmorning they 're looking for more receptive does . Not an earth-shattering bit of data , but it 's just the type of information that separates a guide 's success from the average hunter 's . And it goes on . " During the rut , bucks will often travel with the wind , not into it , " says Hanold . " They 'll rely on their ears and eyes for detecting does or danger ahead of them . Their noses will cover the area behind them . It allows the deer to monitor a lot more territory . So do n't assume the deer will only come from one direction . " Hanold finds that his clients have had little success with grunt calls , but ticking antlers together during the pre-rut has worked extremely well on big bucks . He says aggressive rattling seems more likely to scare bucks out of the area than bring them in . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer fighting , a situation most bucks would rather avoid . Bo Pitman , who runs White Oak Plantation in Tuskegee , Ala. , one of the nation 's largest hunting operations , says the same theory holds for aggressive grunt calling during the pre-rut . " In October I 've seen aggressive grunting clear out a field full of bucks , " Pitman says . " They figure someone 's fixing to get gored . Rattling works well early on , but not later in the season . That 's when grunting becomes more effective . If a hunter does n't sound like a mallard , I have no qualms about him calling on his own . " Pitman , who has built a reputation as one of the top whitetail guides in the Southeast , manages more than 450 permanent stands on 16,000 acres , yet you 'd think he only has 5 or 10 stands . " We hunt each stand only a few times a year , every 7 to 10 days . Deer can smell human scent eight hours after a person has left . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber boots or chest waders . Cover scents do n't work well enough to suit me , so infrequent stand use is the only way to keep a stand productive . " During the first part of Alabama 's bow season  --  from Oct. 15 to the beginning of rifle season in late November  --  Pitman concentrates on planted green fields , corn , crab apple trees , and areas with white acorns , since by then the browse has already turned " hard " and lost most of the nutritional value it had when it was green . Late in the day Pitman concentrates on food plots , and in the morning he likes to hunt oak flats , which the deer cross to reach bedding areas . The deer most often will bed in 3- to 10-year-old clear-cuts . " We stay out of the bedding areas , " Pitman says . " Bump deer there and they 'll completely change their travel patterns . " Pitman calls opening week of rifle season " bonus week " because hunting pressure is at its height and bucks are being pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape funnels next to land that receives the heaviest hunting pressure . He also places his clients along fresh clear-cuts . The downed treetops give bucks a false sense of security , he says , and hunters in tree stands can see down into the tangles . Pitman discovered that from mid-season on , hunter success is closely tied to the weather . He says the day after a cold front passes is the best time to kill a buck . Fog , on the other hand , produces the least deer activity , followed by high winds and then rain . Pitman adjusts by hunting pine thickets on rainy or windy days . He says pines offer cover to block the weather . As a bonus , rain causes a favorite deer food , mushrooms , to sprout under the trees . Pitman says that during the middle to latter part of the season , green fields are still the best for afternoon hunting , but oak flats no longer offer deer enough security cover . So , during morning hunts , he places clients on brush-choked clear-cuts . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which by late season has become a main food source . " People think whitetails are far more mysterious than they really are , " Pitman says . " If hunters spent less time worrying and second-guessing themselves , they 'd be a lot more successful . " That attitude sums up the no-nonsense ways in which Orvall Kuester and Mark Eddy hunt whitetails . Both outfitters hunt big-woods country , primarily on public land : Kuester has been based in northwestern Montana for 18 years , and Eddy is a successful guide in the Adirondack Mountains of New York . Unlike Pitman and Hanold , these outfitters favor still-hunting . " During early bow season we 'll hunt the bottoms around alfalfa and grain fields , " says Kuester . " Bucks are still in bachelor herds until their velvet comes off . After that it 's extremely difficult to pattern them . There 's a lot of country out here , and food is just everywhere . " That 's why Kuester loves the final two weeks of Montana 's rifle season : By then the rut 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food sources . " Most of our big bucks are taken where the logging activity 's been greatest . Does are busy feeding for winter , and most of the food is found along the edges of clear-cuts and old logging roads . So that 's where the bucks will be . " I use tree stands occasionally , but even if I 've found a fresh scrape line with big tracks , there 's no telling when the buck will return . I might spend more time in that area , but I 'd rather be still-hunting . Rutting bucks cover a lot of country , so I will too . I 'll spend half an hour at a clear-cut at first light , then move on to the next one . " Of course , how much Kuester moves depends on the stalking conditions . If the snow 's quiet , he covers a lot of ground . But if the snow 's crunchy , he sits longer before moving on , especially when he finds a good scrape line . True to his keep-it-simple methods , Kuester relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's with a client who 's not in condition to walk far . " The results are too erratic , " Kuester says . " Some days you might rattle in bucks 6 out of 12 setups . But on other days you wo n't see a thing . Covering lots of territory is my client 's best chance of taking a trophy buck . " Eddy also covers a lot of ground in the Adirondacks  --  as much as 10 miles a day  --  but he focuses on swamps , river bottoms , and forest edges typical of the East . During the rut , however , he might only hunt two miles a day , focusing on areas with lots of buck sign . To keep deer moving , Eddy often conducts two-man drives , with one hunter still-hunting through a thick swamp and the other positioned along escape funnels . Or , he says he 'll stand-hunt on small hardwood knobs surrounded by spruce swamps , catching bucks moving along runways coursing between the lowland contours . His favorite tactic is still-hunting , moving slowly and stopping often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a grunt call sparingly , normally to turn a buck or get a closer shot , but he does n't bother with rattling . He feels that the buck/doe ratio is too low in this region for the method to be effective . Eddy 's favorite hunting conditions are overcast skies with a light wind and new snow . He says that the subdued light lets him see farther into he woods . He prefers steady breezes to help him stay downwind of the deer , and above all , he looks forward to the days he can track bucks in new snow . " If I find a set of tracks that leads to rubs or scrapes , or horn marks in the snow where the deer 's been feeding , I know it 's a buck and will take up that trail , " he says . " Another clue is urine ; if there 's more of a stream than a puddle , a buck made it . " Two to three inches of new snow is ideal , but only if it 's over older snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover bare ground . " MULE DEER The Toughest Trophy Taking a big muley buck used to be easy ; nowadays it 's arguably North America 's toughest trophy . Mule deer numbers have declined , and the deer have become wise to increased hunting pressure . George Taulman , who runs United States Outfitters Inc. , one of the West 's premier big-game hunting operations , says the three keys to taking trophy bucks are location , location , and location . " You ca n't kill what 's not there , " he says . " You 've got to hunt areas with high numbers of trophy animals . " Taulman hunts in Arizona , Utah , and Nevada , and he attributes much of his 80 to 90 percent client success rate to thorough scouting . " If you 're planning a 10-day hunt , you 're a lot better off going early and scouting for 5 days , locating a trophy , then hunting the first 5 days of the season . Undisturbed bucks are a lot easier to hunt . " Taulman relies almost entirely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He scans areas where big bucks feel comfortable , which means any place that 's cool and has multiple escape routes . " Big bucks like to lay up near ridgetops , close to thick cover , " Taulman says . " The one exception is during the rut , when they could be anywhere . Then we 'll glass larger , more open areas . " Bedded bucks hold tight unless they feel really threatened . So it 's critical to reach a vantage point before first light to catch them moving to their beds . Most guys hunt their way to a good spot . But if they do n't reach it before the bucks have bedded , all they 've really done is hurt their chances , " says Taulman . Jay Verzuh of Colorado Elite Outfitters , in Grand Junction , has guided mule deer hunters for 16 years and earned a reputation for taking huge animals . He too relies on binoculars to spot trophy bucks . For optimum viewing , Verzuh says he gets to a high vantage but is careful not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of timber . " Do n't be in a hurry , " says Verzuh . " Most hunters glass an area way too quickly and end up passing up bucks they never knew were there . " In the early season Verzuh finds bucks up high in fairly open country . He glasses areas with snowberries and serviceberries , prime mule deer browse , and watches aspen stands where the deer often bed . Verzuh is adamant in warning his clients away from bedding areas , which if disturbed could prevent the deer from returning to the same food sources . " Walk around near their beds , and they 're apt to clear out of the country , " he says . When the muleys start their rut , Verzuh shifts to glassing sagebrush flats and ridges , where bucks are likely to be chasing does . Cold , clear days following a snowstorm always produce increased deer activity , he says , as will early-season rainstorms that lower temperatures by 10deg to 15deg  --  deer feel more energetic in cool weather . ELK Far From the Maddening Crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , says Tim Beardsley , who has been guiding and outfitting for 18 years . His base is Ennis , Mont. , and his specialty is elk . " It boils down to working areas with the least hunter activity , whether that means hunting in four feet of snow at 10,000 feet or moving down to 6,000 feet and no snow , " Beardsley says . " Most hunters hit the obvious places with lots of elk . But if you 're after a big bull , the less accessible country is where they 're going to be . " Ron Dube , of Wapiti , Wyo. , has been outfitting for 22 years and is known for his outstanding success rates on elk and mule deer . He escapes the crowds by packing 24 miles into the wilderness during the state 's early rifle season . For the late season in November , he hunts migrating elk , and with the snow and cold weather , he finds that packing in five miles is sufficient to get away from other hunters . Locating bulls during the early season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time glassing ridges and draws , but the season also coincides with the rut , which means he can find bulls by bugling . Dube says one of his favorite tactics is to keep a bull bugling while the client stalks in for a shot . During the late season , though , he does n't have that advantage . Then , like Beardsley , he counts on his binoculars . " We hunt a lot of black timber , but we start off by glassing parks at first light , " Dube says . " Bulls are in the open more during the colder months , stocking up for winter . But we look for tracks as much as for the animals themselves . When we see a number of tracks near patches of timber , we 'll check them out . If all the tracks are big , they probably belong to a bachelor herd , and we 'll go after them . If the tracks are all mixed up in different sizes , it 's probably a herd of cows and calves . A good bull could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother tracking them . " Beardsley is just as willing to trail a lone set of tracks as those of a bachelor herd . " Herds will bed down shortly after daylight , but lone bulls that have n't been pressured by hunters can stay all day , intermittently feeding and bedding , " he says . " Since you 've got all day , take your time and do n't worry about catching up to him right away . " If he heads toward a timbered bench where he might bed , get off the track , loop uphill of the bench , and come down on him from the opposite direction . He 's probably facing his back trail , and you could catch him completely off guard . " Dube likes to stay on a set of tracks and move slowly with his rifle at ready . He scans for movement and glimpses of the elk . He can tell from the tracks if a bull is looking to bed . If the elk 's on a steep ridge and the tracks circle a draw toward thick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telltale signs of bedding behavior are meandering tracks that zigzag a lot within a short distance . Dube uses cow calls to calm bulls that have seen him but are n't quite sure what he is . He 'll also use a short bugle to stop a fleeing bull . " Most bulls you see in thick timber will be from 25 to 75 yards away , " he says . " A bugle will almost always stop him long enough for you to get off a shot . " To sneak close to bedded bulls , Dube uses a squeeze bottle of baby powder to precisely gauge wind direction . He also encourages clients to use their noses to locate elk , which are fragrant beasts . Often , by working into the wind , you can smell the musky odor as you get close to elk . This is especially true during the rut . Beardsley has another tip for stalking bedded bulls : " I do n't care how quiet you think you are . All the bull 's doing is sitting there . You 're the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've found that sometimes making more noise is better . Elk can sense when something 's trying to stalk them , and when conditions are n't perfect , they 'll hear you . So instead of creeping along , just try a slow approach , without out too much concern about noise . It can actually pique a bull 's curiosity and make him stick around to see what 's coming  --  he might think it 's another elk . Do n't think you wo n't see him just because you 're making a racket . " It 's these types of tips , even those that seem contradictory , that separate a guide 's hunting knowledge from the average sport 's . So if you 're lucky enough to hunt with a guide , take his advice . He 'll know how to hunt his back : yard better than you do . As Larry Hanold laments , " I 've got this one place where I see lots of big bucks , but I ca n't get anyone to hunt there .... Maybe it 's because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' COMMANDMENTS * Follow the outfitter 's instructions . * Be in good physical shape . * Be familiar enough with your rifle to handle it quickly . * Practice shooting before you hunt . * Keep your variable scope on the lowest power . * Hunt with your rifle in your hand , not over your shoulder . * Hunt slowly and methodically . * Wear quiet clothing and appropriate footwear . * Learn how to glass effectively . * Rely on sound hunting techniques , not on gadgets .
