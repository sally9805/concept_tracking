STEPPING DOWN . NORMAN PODHORETZ , 65 , editor and writer ; as the editor in chief of Commentary ; in New York City . During his 35-year stewardship , Podhoretz transformed the Jewish monthly from a voice of liberal social concern to a promoter of hard-line anti-Sovietism abroad and a basher of all things leftish and countercultural at home . The changes mirrored Podhoretz 's own political evolution as one of the most influential-and certainly the most inescapable-of neoconservatives . <P> DIED . RON LUCIANO , 57 , former umpire ; from suicide by carbon-monoxide poisoning ; in Endicott , New York . Luciano 's 11 Astroturf-chewing years of calls and confrontations paved the way for a second career as a sports commentator and author of books titled with baseball-related puns . <P> DIED . MEHDI BAZARGAN , 87 , former Prime Minister of Iran ; in Zurich . Originally an engineering professor , the soft-spoken Bazargan was imprisoned for his human-rights activism during the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , making Bazargan a natural choice for Prime Minister of the provisional government formed after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini 's Revolutionary Council soon deteriorated into a bitter power struggle , culminating in his resignation just nine months later . <P> Died . VERA MAXWELL , 93 , fashion designer , in Rincon , Puerto Rico . From her cotton proto-jumpsuit fashioned for riveting Rosies during World War II to 1974 's " Speed Suit " -a zipperless , buttonless dress that could be pulled on in seconds-Maxwell pioneered sportswear for women that was as comfortable as it was chic , earning herself the sobriquet " the American Chanel . " Maxwell 's sources of inspiration were marvelously eclectic : a 1935 visit with Albert Einstein was said to have prompted her to copy his tweed jacket and add two skirts , a pair of pants and an extra jacket to create her classic " Weekend Wardrobe .
