<p> THREE years ago , when consumers complained about the smell of its bleach , the Clorox Company cut the chlorine odor by adding floral scents  --  and helped increase its share of the American bleach market to a remarkable 60 percent . <p> Last year , after a competitor introduced a cleaning spray intended for daily use in the shower , Clorox unabashedly copied it  --  but used a clear bottle with pastel labeling , a contrast to the rival 's industrial-looking container . More appealing packaging , the company figured , would prompt consumers to leave the bottle near the shower instead of under the sink , increasing the likelihood that they would use it each day . The product , Tilex Fresh Shower , quickly became a big seller . <p> Pedestrian fiddling with pedestrian products , many a metal-bending or electron-zapping executive might sniff . But not a smart investor . Clorox 's stock has shot up 372 percent the last five years  --  45 percent the last year alone . That has far outpaced the market , outgunned industry giants like Procter &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gold in the most everyday goods . <p> And this year ? Well , it 's time for Clorox to prove itself all over again . <p> In acquiring the First Brands Corporation of Danbury , Conn.  --  maker of familiar products like Glad bags , Scoop Away cat box filler and STP motor oil additive  --  Clorox has bought a company that increases its size by almost 50 percent but that resembles the vapid Clorox that G. Craig Sullivan took over seven years ago . <p> Back then , Clorox , which competitors had mostly dismissed as knowing how to sell bleach but not much else , was stuck with a complacent management and a tired product line . Its profits were falling , and its stockholders were skittish . Mr. Sullivan , who studied accounting , began his career selling cake mix in Brooklyn for P. &; G. and was hardly a golden boy . His own mother once suggested he might not make it in sales and urged him to consider a new line of work . Investors reacted to his appointment by knocking the stock down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a change of heart . First , Mr. Sullivan cut managers he judged to be out of step with the new marching orders . " When you 've got 25 or 30 years of white-rat training , sometimes it 's hard to change , so we just decided for them that maybe they ought to do something else , " he said . Half the management team left . <p> Then he dumped money-losing operations like bottled water and restaurant equipment , bought grime-fighting brands like Lestoil cleaner and S.O.S scrubbing pads that were more in line with Clorox 's core business . And he stepped up marketing for existing brands like Pine-Sol and Formula 409 cleansers . <p> The results have made the one-time Wall Street wallflower the life of the party : from the time that Mr. Sullivan took over through the end of last year , Clorox 's revenues increased by 76 percent to $2.7 billion , while profits shot up 200 percent , to $298 million . The company 's market capitalization in that time rose from $2.5 billion to $10 billion . Clorox shares closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> BUT with the purchase of First Brands for $2 billion  --  a deal that closed in January  --  some investors are wondering whether Clorox has overextended itself . The deal , the largest in Clorox 's 86-year history , increases its revenue to a projected $3.95 billion . <p> But like the Clorox of old , First Brands had struggled with a number of stalled or fading products . Slowing retail sales resulted in disappointing earnings for the company last year . So some analysts and investors who have been enthusiastic about Clorox wonder whether the growth of the 1990 's can be sustained . <p> " The big difficulty will be how life is different under the auspices of Clorox , " said Andrew Shore , an analyst who follows the company for Paine Webber . " First Brands may have an initial good boost from cutting costs and new advertising and new products , but I think Clorox has to make First Brands a much better organization . " <p> Not to worry , Mr. Sullivan said , noting that a key element of Clorox 's growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their luster under previous owners . That , he said , is what made products like S.O.S and Armor All car-care products such good fits . " With all due respect , " Mr. Sullivan said , " those companies , and I think they would admit it themselves , were not consumer brand-focused . " <p> Mr. Sullivan says he has the formula to keep things going , and it 's pretty simple : Execute . Freshen old brands , extend product lines , improve advertising , squeeze costs . He intends to maximize the First Brands investment , for example , by steadily adding new features to Glad bags and wraps , much as diaper makers do to their products , and extending the brand name to entirely different products that will likely hit store shelves next year . ( He 's holding off on discussing the details . ) <p> Of the former First Brands managers , he said bluntly : " They do n't understand the consumer , they do n't understand that their target may not be the right target and their advertising mix may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , tinkering with even well-respected brands to unleash their potential . <p> When the company bought the Armor All Products Corporation two years ago , it saw unrealized promise in a product called Flash Black , a clear liquid in a black bottle that is used to shine tires . <p> To emphasize the gloss potential that Flash Black was supposed to deliver , Clorox repackaged it in a clear bottle and changed the name to Extreme Tire Shine . It was minor tweaking , but it " essentially doubled the business , " said Derrick Gordon , a group marketing manager in Clorox 's auto products division . <p> The marketing team also scuttled what it viewed as a mismanaged ad campaign created for Armor All by the previous owner . " How do I say it ? They did n't understand really who their customer was , " Mr. Sullivan said of Armor All 's managers . <p> Karen Rose , Clorox 's chief financial officer , pointed to Armor All 's choice as its spokesman of the retired football star Terry Bradshaw as a major marketing misstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the 1970 's , so you know he does n't have all of his hair anymore , " Ms. Rose said . And since the target customer base for Armor All is males aged 16 to 25 , " Terry Bradshaw does n't speak to that . " <p> One of Clorox 's ad agencies , DDB Needham San Francisco , came up with fresher ads . Spots for a car wax that the company is introducing under the Armor All name clearly have youthful testosterone in mind . They use hip music and a sporty car to depict what looks like a party at a car wash . <p> Using the tag line " stay a little longer , " the commercials feature a model with a come-hither pout who borrows the sports car 's rear-view mirror to apply red lipstick . Since it is obvious that she has no intention of scrubbing the tires , the impression seems to be that Armor All will not only produce a lasting shine , it just might help you find a girl . <p> Clorox has been known to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley salad-dressing line had confused consumers with too many new products , another of its agencies , Young &; Rubicam San Francisco , dreamed up a slogan that ran the risk of flouting Americans ' infatuation with change at breakneck speed : " Not new and improved . " <p> " One of the things we found is that consumers do n't want to think about food products coming from a big processor , " explained David Matz , a Clorox general manager . " They want to think about it coming from my grandmother 's formula . " <p> That may be , but no matter how wholesome and folksy an image it wants to project , Clorox is clearly driven by technology and research . It spends about 2 percent of revenues , in line with its peers ' budgets , to create products meant to better clean sinks or shine glass . At its 28-acre product-development nerve center in nearby Pleasanton , workers go to odd lengths in the name of innovation . <p> In a recent test of the effectiveness of a pet product , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sniff tests of used cat litter . " The basic premise is , if you do n't like it , how can you expect the consumer to buy it ? " said Vincent E. Alvarez , director of technology . " Why is your nose any different than their nose ? " <p> Of course , much of the research is far more high tech : computer design and testing of plastic products , an automated system for soiling cloth to test stain removers and computerized testing of the effects of humidity on packaging . Such work has helped to cut costs and enabled Clorox slash its average product-development time to six months , from two years . <p> The R &; D army is a key contributor to the company 's battle to control the supermarket cleaning aisle , but some products seem to provide insurmountable challenges . <p> Clorox 's insecticide sales , for example , have slipped lately , with sales falling by percentages in the low single digits last year ; shipments of its Combat and Black Flag brand were off 3 percent in the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major factor in the bug business , but was forced to take the Combat line when it bought Pine-Sol ; even Mr. Sullivan acknowledged that the company was " trying to figure that business out . " <p> Still , the product development folks have gone to great lengths to develop new ways to trap and kill household pests . At the sprawling research campus , the company built a veritable insect zoo , to study the behavior of roaches , mosquitoes and ants . There is even a " roach rearing room " where workers watch the bugs breed . <p> And , as luck would have it , the campus was unwittingly built on an ant colony , which provided all sorts of opportunities for watching those insects travel and eat . <p> But if Clorox is determined to fight on in the insecticide aisle , the company tends not to suffer losses on product lines for long . For example , in 1994 it introduced Hidden Valley salad dressings aimed at children , with flavors like pizza and nacho sauce . Unfortunately , while parents seemed to like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clorox discontinued the line after a year . <p> " They do n't have a golden touch , and not everything goes well , " said Timothy Ghriskey , a senior portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation , which owns 380,000 shares of Clorox , " but they seem willing to cut things off as well when they are not working . " <p> Even so , maintaining the rapid gains of the last few years will be a challenge . About 80 percent of Clorox 's revenues and profits come from the United States ; in contrast , about 80 percent of Colgate-Palmolive 's business is overseas . Clorox is seeking to increase its relatively tiny international presence , but with the economic outlook uncertain in much of the world , that effort carries its own risks . <p> Moreover , at 38 times forward earnings , Clorox stock is trading at a multiple more typical of technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft than of a maker of toilet cleansers . Indeed , some investors , while still bullish on Clorox 's management and strategy , have begun to dump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Stephen Yacktman , vice president of Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago , which has owned Clorox shares since 1994 , said his firm bought the stock at a price 7 times earnings before income , depreciation and amortization . With that measure now at 20 , he added , " the big upside from that is not going to be there . " <p> He is still a Clorox fan , but has sold some of his shares . <p> Even so , many analysts remain optimistic about the stock 's future growth potential . " This company finds new niches and finds that consumer whose need is not being met , " said Carole Warner of Prudential Securities . " They own the cleaning aisle . " <p> More fundamentally , said Mr. Shore of Paine Webber , " this is a company that had tremendous self-doubt in the 1980 's , and I think Craig Sullivan made them believe they could be better than they ever thought they were . " <p> " That 's the equivalent of what a good coach is to a team , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefty returns , Mr. Sullivan 's compensation package is relatively modest , said Graef S. Crystal , an executive compensation critic . Although Mr. Sullivan 's $800,000 annual salary and $1.1 million bonus last year was " within the normal range " for his peer group , Mr. Crystal said , the pay package was actually 49 percent below the market because it did not include stock options and restricted shares . <p> FOR decades , Clorox was a sleepy , one-product company . It was founded in 1913 by five Oakland entrepreneurs who started a bleach factory with $500 and did not add another product for 56 years . The company became a division of P. &; G. in 1957 and was divested in 1969 . <p> Clorox 's roots help explain the culture that Mr. Sullivan faced in 1992 , when he was elevated from group vice president over the outgoing chief executive 's heir apparent . The company controlled about half of the bleach business , and its rivals simply followed at a distance . But now  --  having bulked up in the 90 's into a formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang onto its new-found entrepreneurial spirit and remain nimble enough to fend off industry giants as well as upstarts . <p> In other words , Mr. Sullivan must prove himself all over again . That , it seems , is fine with him , since few people thought he could pull it off the first time . And while always careful to spread the credit , he has enough executive ego to suggest that his last seven shareholder letters are useful reading  --  a reminder that this is a company that now delivers on its promises . <p> " But again , " he added , " this is n't about me .
