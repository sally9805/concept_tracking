PART ONE KNOCK KNOCK New York City March 1986 KNOCK KNOCK There 's a simple knock on the door , nothing special . " Who 's there ? " " Mailman , " comes the answer . " Special delivery . " I open the door . Why did I open the door ? I see a mailman , six-foot , barrel chest , receding blond , blue eyes . No mail . " Is your name Laura ? " " No , you must have the wrong apartment . " I start to close the door . It 's afternoon but I 'm in my pajamas , rags I sleep in . I like to sleep in rags . " Just a moment . " He pushes hack the door . " Your name 's not Laura ? " " No , " I say . " It is n't . " He takes a folded letter from a trouser pocket , opens it . I 'm staring at his shoes , scuffed , pointy-toed , buff-colored western boots . Do mailmen wear western boots ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment number . " Yes , but there must be some mistake . " " This is the right address but you 're not Laura ? " " That 's right . I 'm not . " " Is this your apartment ? " " Yes . " " Well , who are you then ? " Before I can make a reply , he pushes the door open wide . " Never mind . Federal agents , D.E.A. Step back , please . We 're coming in . " Now there 's a gun in his hand . He shoulders past me into the hall . Behind him , four men in plain clothesno , five-are coming up the stairs . There 's a woman , too , blonde , petite with a ponytail , wearing a tweed blazer . I see many hands on holstered guns . I shrink back inside . My head is spinning . I sit at a table in the living room . A man with a chin cleft , in a suit and trenchcoat , carefully reads me my rights . I stare at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gray fluffball , two tigers . I look away . " Can I see some identification ? " I ask . I 'm stalling . I sound like a child . The man in the trenchcoat shows me his badge and ID . While the others station themselves around the room , study walls , and peek out windows , I scrutinize the ID 's photo and particulars without comprehension . My eyes wo n't focus . I see only " Drug Enforcement Agency . " This one 's name is . . . Dick . " Now , what is your name ? " Dick asks . He speaks softly . He 's very patient . I have to spell it out . It 's painful . I 'm not alone . A friend with whom I share this apartment is sitting speechless on my bed . " Ladies , you 're under arrest for the sale of narcotics , a federal offense , " Dick announces . " We know you 've been dealing heroin here . We 've made several buys through an intermediary . Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My friend shakes her head , pets one of the cats . " All right , I have to ask one question : do you have any heroin here now ? " The female agent and two of the men surround me at the table . Hands are still on guns . I 'm in my pajamas . I might as well be naked . " We 'll have to search your apartment , " Dick says . " You have a warrant ? " I 'm all attitude . Do I think this is TV ? " No , " he admits . " We do n't have a warrant , but it wo n't be difficult to get one . It 'll take about an hour , maybe two , and we 'll stay right here till it arrives . " Then we 'll wait , I say to myself . To the cops , I say not a word . " Do you have any heroin in your possession ? " Dick says again . In another room off the kitchen , the tiny room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought by the regular mailman , are sitting on a table-shelf in front of a scale . I 'd been waiting for one of my better customers . Was he the rat ? That one ? You can never trust a junkie . I should have known . My new source was here minutes before , left with all my money . In my pocket I 'm holding nearly an ounce of his China White . The woman agent makes a move toward me . I stand up , reach in my tattered pocket , hand a plastic sandwich bag over to Dick . It 's not my lunch ; it 's my life . The woman pats me down lightly , with nervous hands . She 's more scared than I am . A rookie , I guess . They sent me a rookie . I almost laugh . Dick looks at the bag , eyes its contents : white rocks the size of mothballs , loose powder at the bottom . It 's the best stuff money can buypure . I 've only had a taste . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dick says . A lock of dark hair falls over his eyes . They 're gray . No , they do n't have a color . " Do you have any more heroin in this apartment ? " It 's five rooms , light and airy , good location . Miserably , I sink into a chair . " In there , " I say , nodding toward the office . " You 'll find it . " Unlike the rest of the place , the office is dark and gloomy , its floor worn out by heavy traffic . In three years I 've had to retile it twice . Dick sends the mailman to check it out . The others pair off to begin their search , but all that seems to interest them is our record collectionit 's vintage . " Please , " I say dumbly . " Can I ask you not to make a mess ? " As if I 'll be there later and have to clean it all up . " No problem , " Dick says cheerfully . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got us . " " Yeah , " I say . " Lucky . " " Someday you 'll thank me for this , " he predicts . " Not real soon , " I say . He laughs , says we can all telex . " She 's cooperating . " I freeze up . When the mailman-cop returns with my Pakistani in his hand , Dick takes me in the office . He closes the door , seats himself at my desk . I take the plain wooden folding chair beside it that has always been the customer 's . I 've never sat in it before myself . I look around . The scale is gone , the mirrors and the razors , the straws . I glance at the bookshelves extending up the opposite wall , and quickly look away . My remaining cash is hidden there , between the pages of several old books . I wonder if they 've found it . " So , " says Dick . " How did a nice girl like you end up in a dirty business like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , I 'm just a junkie , that 's all . " My shoulders sag . " Anyone can be a junkie . " " That so ? " " Yeah . " " I wonder . " " It 's the truth , " I say . It is . " How does it happen ? " he asks . " I 'm just curious . " " It happens , that 's all . " He tells me they 've been watching me for several weeks , intercepting my mail , tapping the phone , making small buys . He asks if I keep my old phone bills . I do , I do n't know why . Collecting was never my thing . The phone is ringing now , incessantly . We let it ring . I stand up and reach for a cardboard briefcase on a shelf above Dick 's head . " All my bills are here , " I tell him . " Take your pick . " He lays a few pages on the desk and looks them over . I see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never made any phone calls , " I explain . " Everyone always called me . " Same as they 're doing now . Wo n't these people ever learn ? The answering machine clicks and clicks , pleading voices asking if I 'm home , when they can come over . Dick cocks an ear , looks up from the hills . " You never made any calls ? Then how 'd you get your stuff ? " " It knocked on the door , like you . " " Come on . " " It did , " I tell him . It did . Dick 's still in his coat . He shifts in his seat . Ca n't tell his age , maybe forty . " I want to tell you something , " he says , fingering the cleft in his chin , milky smooth , no stubble . " I ca n't make any promises , but I can almost guarantee , from what we 've got here , right now you 're looking at five to fifteen years in a federal prison . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , maybe three , if I 'm good . I ca n't stand it . I stop thinking . He asks if I know a certain guywhat should I call him ? Angelo . " Angelo who ? " I say . " Angelo something . " " I 'm not sure . " " Listen , " Dick says . Still patient , very deliberate , he tells me all about Angelo , a smuggler . He 's been on this Angelo a long time but the guy keeps slipping away . Dick knows more about him than I do . He peers at me , searching my face , then the phone bills , then again my poker face . " Is Angelo a friend of yours ? " " I do n't know who you mean . " " You know who I mean . " " Who set me up ? " " You can figure that out for yourself . " " I have n't got any idea . " Actually , I have several , all of them wrong . I must 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supplier once told me . When you start to get greedy , it 's the beginning of the end . " You were n't that surprised to see us , were you ? " Dick inquires . " Of course I was ! " I nearly shout . " I mean , I knew this day might come . I just did n't think it would be today . " " So , why 'd you let us in ? " " I thought you were the mailman ! " He chuckles . " That was a good trick , was n't it ? " He offers me a smoke . It 's not my brand and I demur . He lights one for himself , has one of the other agents bring me one of my own . " You 're not very tough , " Dick says . " Not at all , " I agree . I feel nauseous . " So , how 'd you and Angelo meet ? " I do n't answer . I ca n't . I look at the phone bills as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted . " I have to ask you again : is this Angelo someone you know ? " " Maybe . I know a lot of people . " I take a drag on my cigarette , drag deep . Dick looks at me , I look at the bills . " Angelo , " I reflect . " I do know an Angelo , " I say then . " I do n't know if he 's the one you mean . " " You get stuff from him , this Angelo ? " Time stops . There 's no sound anywhere , no blood rushing in my ears , no sign from God , just heroin seeping through my pores . I need a bath . I need an out . There is n't one .
