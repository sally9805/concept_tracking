The Adventurous Oenophile is selecting wines to accompany a festive dinner . For aperitifs , the A.O. and his companion want a sparkling wine  --  and what could be livelier than the 1986 Ste. Chapelle Blanc de Noir brut ? With the appetizer , a glass of white wine would be appropriate : the A.O. selects a 1986 Anderson Valley Chardonnay . Since the diners have chosen meat entrees , the A.O. requests a bottle of Llano Estacado 's 1986 Cellar Select Cabernet Sauvignon . And a non-vintage Johannisberg Riesling from Chaddsford Winery will set off dessert nicely . The sommelier takes the order with an approving smile . <P> This hypothetical ( but possible ) selection of wines  --  all American , all good  --  is singular in one respect . Not one of the wines is a product of California or New York , although these two rank first and a distant second among the nation 's winemaking states . The sparkling aperitif comes from Idaho , the white wine from New Mexico , the red from Texas and the dessert wine from Pennsylvania . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wyoming and North and South Dakota  --  boast commercial operations that produce wine from grapes . Some are ma-and-pa vintners with an annual capacity of 1,000 cases or less . Others are industrial giants , like Washington 's prizewinning Chateau Ste. Michelle , which turns out 500,000 cases a year of 14 different varietals . Most of these regional vintages , comparable to Europe 's little country wines , have only local repute . But the White House has proudly served Cabernets from Texas , Pinot Noirs from Oregon and Chardonnays from Virginia and New York 's Long Island at state dinners . A port from Missouri 's Mount Pleasant vineyards won a prize in London . Wines from the Midwest , insists Chicago expert Patrick Fegan , " to an unbiased audience can stand up to wines from California and the rest of the world . " <P> Making wine may not be as American as cherry pie , but the tradition is a lot older than the Constitution . French Huguenot settlers fermented juice from Florida 's native muscadine grapes as early as 1565 . In the 1780s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monticello , his Virginia estate . ( None took root , alas . ) And Count Agoston Haraszthy , the patriarch of California vintners , started his first U.S. vineyard at what is now the Wollersheim winery in Prairie du Sac , Wis. , in 1847 . During the 19th century , wines from Ohio and Missouri won gold medals in European competitions , but thousands of vine-bearing acres in these and other states were plowed under during Prohibition .
