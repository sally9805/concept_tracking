Prologue The bateau slides through the still waters of the bayou . Still , black waters as dark as the night sky . As dark as the heart of a killer . In the water stand the cypress , rank upon rank , tall sentinels as motionless and silent as death . Behind them , on the banks , the weeping willows , boughs bowed as if by grief , and the live oak with their twisted trunks and gnarled branches , looking like enchanted things eternally frozen in a moment of agony . And from their contorted limbs hangs the moss , gray and dusty and tattered , like old feather boas left to rot in the attic of some long-forgotten , long-ruined mansion . All is gray and black in the night in the swamp . The absence of light , the reflection of light . A sliver of moon is wedged between high clouds , then disappears . Stillness descends all around as the boat passes . Eyes peer out from the reeds , from the trees , from just above the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted . But all the creatures wait as the bateau slips past them , its motor purring , low and throaty , like a panther 's growl . The air of expectation thickens like the mist that hovers between the trunks of the tupelo and sweet gum trees . One predator has struck the night , cunning and vicious with no motivation but the thrill of holding another 's life and savoring the power to snuff it out . The creatures of the swamp watch as the predator passes , as the scent of fresh blood mingles with the rank , metallic aroma of the bayou1 and the sweet perfume of wild honeysuckle , jasmine , and verbena . The motor dies . The boat skirts a raft of water hyacinth noses through the cattails and lily pads , and sidles up to themuddy bank , where ferns and creepers grow in a tangled skein . Somewhere in the distance a scream tears through the fabric of the night . Like an echo . Like a memory . The predator smiles , fondly , slyly , thinking not of the nutria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead on the floor of the bateau . Another kill . Another rush . Another dizzying high . Power , more seductive than sex , more addictive than cocaine . Blood , warm and silky , sweet as wine . The pulse of life rushing with fear , pounding , frantic . . . ebbing , dying . The body is dragged to the bank , left near the end of a crushed clamshell path that glows powdery white as the moon flashes down once again like a searchlightthere and gone , there and gone . Its beam illuminates a dark head of hair , damp and disheveled with no trace of the style that had been so painstakingly sculpted and sprayed hours ago ; a face , ghostly pale , cheeks rouged clownishly , lipstick smeared , mouth slack , eyes open and staring , unseeing , up at the heavens . Looking for mercy , looking for deliverance . Too late for either . She will be found . In a day , maybe two .
