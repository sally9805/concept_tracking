<p> When I addressed the joint session of Congress in February 1990 , I made the following remark : " I often hear the question , How can the United States of America help us today ? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been : you can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy . " As a rule , I do not quote myself , but recently people have asked me , often in anticipation of the forthcoming summit meeting of the Group of Seven and of the meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev there , whether I still stood by what I said then , and what I really meant . <p> To account for my affirmative answer to the former question I have to answer the latter first . Too many people took for granted that I meant economic help , which I did not  --  that is , not only , not even mainly . I meant that it was in the interests of my country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union a more free , more democratic and more stable place , with the emphasis on democracy . <p> The experience of the postwar period has shown us that no amount of economic assistance will make a totalitarian country more prosperous unless it is also made more democratic . <p> In the beginning of 1990 , the Soviet Union was still largely undecided about where it was going , and any economic assistance would most likely have gone down the bottomless drain of bureaucracy , incompetence and corruption . This situation has changed . The democratic forces are trying to organize themselves and to make a radical break with the past . The former Foreign Minister , Eduard Shevardnadze , and his colleagues from the democratic camp are the foremost representative of this trend . Progress has also been made in talks about the new union treaty . Although its final shape is still unclear , one thing seems certain : the republics and the political and economic reform they advocate will play an ever more important role . The Russian President , Boris Yeltsin , will hardly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door again . And , finally , it seems Mikhail Gorbachev himself is now more committed to reform than ever before . <p> There should be , however , explicit guarantees that the Soviet Union will not revert to its totalitarian , imperial past , and will not threaten other countries in the future . The situation may present an opportunity for democracy and peace in the world for decades to come . It also presents a risk should the antidemocratic forces in the Soviet Union prevail again and use whatever outside assistance might come to bolster their obsolete regime . <p> An evaluation of both the opportunity and the risk shows several things about the nature of assistance to the Soviet Union that could be forthcoming : it should be assistance to the people and politicians with a democratic mandate rather than to the bureaucrats . It should be conditional on the Soviet Union clearly showing its willingness not to project its force outside its territory and to let all its neighbors choose their own way , including those republics of the present Soviet Union with aspirations to determine their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . It should be assistance to the individual republics , with ever-increasing rights , rather than to the center of the union . And it should be a thousand points of small assistance targeted to specific areas of a newly created market economy rather than one big bulk assistance designed to support the original pillars of the crumbling edifice . The decision in each case should depend on the economic merits of a project rather than on the arbitrary will of central planners . <p> In this connection , we come across another paradox . How can one reconcile the obvious need for stability in Europe and the Soviet Union with the equally obvious longing of a number of peoples there for emancipation from the central power ? How can one reconcile the stated principle of territorial integrity of states with the equally stated principle of self-determination of nations ? When assistance is discussed , should it be applied in support of the former or the latter principle ? <p> There is no easy solution to this except perhaps more democracy . The trend in democratic countries seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of the regions and diminishing the importance of the frontiers . When this principle is applied to the vast territory of the Soviet Union , it would seem to speak in favor of assisting the most promising areas , the islands of positive deviation which could later spread over the whole area , regardless of its future internal structure . <p> The question , of course , is what those new islands are and what would be the most adequate form of help to each of them . The lack of experience with the transformation of ossified totalitarian regimes into functioning market economies with democratic governments , as well as the size of the country and of the population , make the task almost impossible to solve . Yet some precedents are already there . <p> They are the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have already embarked irreversibly on the road to pluralist democracy and a market economy . For 40 years , they shared the same totalitarian system imposed on them by the Soviet Union . After overthrowing the system in peaceful popular revolutions , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and democratization . <p> Of these countries , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Poland seem to have made the most progress so far . With moderate economic assistance from the West , they have introduced changes . Most Western analysts now recognize that these three countries have every chance of succeeding . If and when they do , their success will also be an example , model and measuring rod for other countries of the region , including the Soviet Union and the peoples of Yugoslavia , which is undergoing a painful transition toward its new shape . <p> The economic reform in Czechoslovakia started in earnest on Jan. 1 of this year , 12 months after the victory of democratic forces , with a strong mandate of free elections . On that date , most price controls were lifted and the currency made convertible , thus opening up the country to market forces . Several weeks later , the first of tens of thousands of small enterprises , services and shops started to be auctioned off to the highest bidder . Big industries are being made ready for privatization as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreign investors and to protect their investments . <p> Six months later , the first results are encouraging . After an initial and expected sharp rise in prices , the month-to-month inflation rate is now less than 2 percent and showing signs of decreasing even further . The currency is stable after the initial devaluation . Even before privatization proper has started , new joint ventures and stock companies have secured new commercial foreign investments exceeding $5 billion . <p> In spite of the Government 's strict monetary policies , which include tight wage controls , the Government enjoys massive public support . There has been no large-scale social unrest or industrial action . The tripartite talks between the Government , entrepreneurs and unions have so far managed to settle amicably all potential sources of conflict . The majority of the population is strongly committed to the transformation . <p> The process is now entering its structural and adaptive phase . Some industries will have to close , others will have to undergo a costly recapitalization . The unemployment rate , now around 3 percent of the labor force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we shall not be able to do without assistance from the most developed countries . <p> One form of assistance would seem to be particularly helpful . It would be the opening of trade between the West and Czechoslovakia ( Hungary and Poland ) to compensate for the collapse of our traditional markets in the Soviet Union and other countries of the late Comecon . <p> To protect at least in part the still fragile economy and to balance the so far one-sided orientation of Czechoslovakian trade , the opening would have to be asymmetrical , thus favoring Czechoslovakian exports to the West , including the " sensitive items " such as textiles , steel and agricultural products . Because of the relatively low competitive value of our goods and limited production capacities , the volume of the exports could never seriously threaten the domestic markets or the balance of trade of Western countries . <p> It is part of our strategy to integrate Czechoslovakia into the family of European nations . By the end of the century , we hope to become full members of the European Community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.C . should envisage our full membership and pave the way for it . It should also reflect the initial asymmetry in our trade exchange and thus open the European markets to our products . <p> We would welcome a more flexible approach by the E.C. , giving us access to their markets now , for we will be facing the biggest problems in the transformation process in the very near future . The competitive atmosphere of the European market will help increase the quality of our goods . The agreement will also open the way for a broad political dialogue and close cooperation with the E.C . countries . Our friends in Hungary and Poland are following the same strategy . We feel we will have a better chance to attain this goal by cooperation with the two countries rather than by competition . <p> Because of our long association with the Soviet market and because of the similar character of the transformation process , the changes in the Soviet Union present both an opportunity and a problem to our economies . The Soviet Union is interested in buying our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The resulting drop in trade between the two countries threatens the fragile balance of our economy and leads to a further increase of the Soviet debt to Czechoslovakia , estimated at $4 billion . Hungary and Poland are experiencing similar difficulties . <p> It would help the Soviet Union and it would help us if a part of the possible Western credits to the Soviet Union were set aside to finance Soviet payments for our exports to their country . This is basically the idea Czechoslovakia 's Foreign Minister , Jiri Dienstbier , introduced at Harvard last year . Polish and Hungarian foreign policy experts and economists have voiced their own versions of the same idea . Some of the leading Western European banks are also studying the possibility of similar operations . The same principle could be applied to the food aid that the Soviet Union may need . It could help solve the problem of our agricultural surpluses without disturbing the balance of the already saturated agricultural markets in the West . <p> The countries of Central and Eastern Europe should never again be limited in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security arrangements . The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany and Poland is of primary importance , and there is no need for it to be delayed or slowed down . A negotiated and peaceful departure of the troops is a prerequisite for a full renewal of the sovereignty of the two countries . <p> Unfortunately , remnants of the old imperial thinking still linger in the Soviet Union as evidenced by disagreements over security clauses in talks about new bilateral treaties between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Poland , and by the so-called Falin doctrine , which bears a sad resemblance to the infamous Brezhnev doctrine Soviet intervention to prevent a retreat from Communism . This is all the more anachronistic , for Mikhail Gorbachev himself takes a more enlightened view of the new treaties in holding that they should be based on the principles of the Paris Charter for the New Europe . <p> We never accepted the efforts of some Soviet politicians to equate the Warsaw Pact with NATO . For us , NATO constitutes the main pillar of European security , supplemented by other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe . <p> An American presence on the Continent has been the backbone of the defense of freedom and democracy for 40 years , and is , in my view , still needed here . It presents no threat to the Soviets but rather a guarantee of peace and stability for the whole of Europe , and the Soviets should accept it as such . <p> I can not conclude but with yet another paradox . In our painful transition toward a state of affairs that most people in the West consider quite natural , Western countries can indeed help us most of all by helping the Soviet Union on its way to democracy . At the same time , in the more difficult transformation of the Soviet Union , Western countries can conceivably help it most by helping Czechoslovakia and other countries in Central Europe  --  to show that it can be done and that it is well worth the effort . The countries of Central Europe can become a center of stability and a source for the diffusion of democratic values and benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . What do you know when you 're seven years old ? All my life , or so I thought , we 'd been in the city of Alexandria , in the Street of the Carpenters , with the other Galileans , and sooner or later we were going home . <br> Late afternoon . We were playing , my gang against his , and when he ran at me again , bully that he was , bigger than me , and catching me off balance , I felt the power go out of me as I shouted : " You 'll never get where you 're going . " <br> He fell down white in the sandy earth , and they all crowded around him . The sun was hot and my chest was heaving as I looked at him . He was so limp . <br> In the snap of two fingers everyone drew back . It seemed the whole street went quiet except for the carpenters ' hammers . I 'd never heard such a quiet . <br> " He 's dead ! " Little Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's dead , he 's dead , he 's dead . " <br> I knew it was true . He was a bundle of arms and legs in the beaten dust . <br> And I was empty . The power had taken everything with it , all gone . <br> His mother came out of the house , and her scream went up the walls into a howl . From everywhere the women came running . <br> My mother lifted me off my feet . She carried me down the street and through the courtyard and into the dark of our house . All my cousins crowded in with us , and James , my big brother , pulled the curtain shut . He turned his back on the light . He said : <br> " Jesus did it . He killed him . " He was afraid . <br> " Do n't you say such a thing ! " said my mother . She clutched me so close to her , I could scarcely breathe . <br> Big Joseph woke up . <br> Now Big Joseph was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd never called him Father . I 'd been taught to call him Joseph . I did n't know why . <br> He 'd been asleep on the mat . We 'd worked all day on a job in Philo 's house , and he and the rest of the men had lain down in the heat of the afternoon to sleep . He climbed to his feet . <br> " What 's that shouting outside ? " he asked . " What 's happened ? " <br> He looked to James . James was his eldest son . James was the son of a wife who had died before Joseph married my mother . <br> James said it again . <br> " Jesus killed Eleazer . Jesus cursed him and he fell down dead . " <br> Joseph stared at me , his face still blank from sleep . There was more and more shouting in the street . He rose to his feet , and ran his hands back through his thick curly hair . <br> My little cousins were slipping n't have done it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " <br> " I saw it , " said James . " I saw it when he made the sparrows out of clay on the Sabbath . The teacher told him he should n't do such things on the Sabbath . Jesus looked at the birds and they turned into real birds . They flew away . You saw it too . He killed Eleazer , Mother , I saw it . " <br> My cousins made a ring of white faces in the shadows : Little Joses , Judas , and Little Symeon and Salome , watching anxiously , afraid of being sent out . Salome was my age , and my dearest and closest . Salome was like my sister . <br> Then in came my mother 's brother Cleopas , always the talker , who was the father of these cousins , except for Big Silas who came in now , a boy older than James . He went into the corner , and then came his brother , Justus , and both wanted to see what was going on . <br> " Joseph , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan bar Zakkai , and his brothers , they 're saying Jesus killed their boy . They 're envious that we got that job at Philo 's house , they 're envious that we got the other job before that , they 're envious that we 're getting more and more jobs , they 're so sure they do things better than we do  --  . " <br> " Is the boy dead ? " Joseph said . " Or is the boy alive ? " <br> Salome shot forward and whispered in my ear . " Just make him come alive , Jesus , the way you made the birds come alive ! " <br> Little Symeon was giggling . He was too little to know what was going on . Little Judas knew , but he was quiet . <br> " Stop , " said James , the little boss of the children . " Salome , be quiet . " <br> I could hear them shouting in the street . I heard other noises . Stones were hitting the walls of the house . My mother started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted my uncle Cleopas and he rushed back out through the door . Joseph went after him . <br> I wriggled out of my mother 's grasp and darted out before she could catch me , and past my uncle and Joseph and right into the crowd as they were all waving and hollering and shaking their fists . I went so fast , they did n't even see me . I was like a fish in the river . I moved in and out through people who were shouting over my head until I got to Eleazer 's house . <br> The women all had their backs to the door , and they did n't see me as I went around the edge of the room . <br> I went right into the dark room , where they 'd laid him on the mat . His mother was there leaning on her sister and sobbing . <br> There was only one lamp , very weak . <br> Eleazer was pale with his arms at his sides , same soiled tunic , and the soles of his feet very black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth showed over his lip . <br> The Greek physician came in  --  he was really a Jew  --  and he knelt down , and he looked at Eleazer and he shook his head . <br> Then he saw me and said : <br> " Out . " <br> His mother turned and she saw it was me and she screamed . <br> I bent over him : <br> " Wake up , Eleazer , " I said . " Wake up now . " <br> I reached out and laid my hand on his forehead . <br> The power went out . My eyes closed . I was dizzy . But I heard him draw in his breath . <br> His mother screamed over and over and it hurt my ears . Her sister screamed . All the women were screaming . <br> I fell back on the floor . I was weak . The Greek physician was staring down at me . I was sick . The room was dim . Other people had rushed in . <br> Eleazer came up , and he was up all knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set on me and punched me and hit me , and knocked my head back against the ground , and kicked me again and again : <br> " Son of David , Son of David ! " he shouted , mocking me , " Son of David , Son of David ! " kicking me in the face , and in the ribs , until his father grabbed him around the waist and picked him up in the air . <br> I ached all over , could n't breathe . <br> " Son of David ! " Eleazer kept shouting . <br> Someone lifted me and carried me out of the house and into the crowd in the street . I was still gasping . I hurt all over . It seemed the whole street was screaming , worse than before , and someone said the Teacher was coming , and my uncle Cleopas was yelling in Greek at Jonathan , Eleazer 's father , and Jonathan was yelling back , and Eleazer was shouting , " Son of David , Son of David ! " <br> I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the crowd would n't let him . Cleopas was pushing at Eleazer 's father . Eleazer 's father was trying to get at Cleopas , but other men took hold of his arms . I heard Eleazer shouting far away . <br> There was the Teacher declaring : " That child 's not dead , you hush up , Eleazer , who said he was dead ? Eleazer , stop shouting ! Whoever could think this child is dead ? " <br> " Brought him back to life , that 's what he did , " said one of theirs . <br> We were in our courtyard , the entire crowd had pushed in with us , my uncle and Eleazer 's people still screaming at each other , and the Teacher demanding order . <br> Now my uncles , Alphaeus and Simon , had come . These were Joseph 's brothers . And they 'd just woken up . They put up their hands against the crowd . Their mouths were hard and their eyes were big . <br> My aunts , Salome and Esther and Mary , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this were a festival , except for Silas and Justus and James who stood with the men . <br> Then I could n't see anymore . <br> I was in my mother 's arms , and she had taken me into the front room . It was dark . Aunt Esther and Aunt Salome came in with her . I could hear stones hitting the house again . The Teacher raised his voice in Greek . <br> " There 's blood on your face ! " my mother whispered . " Your eye , there 's blood . Your face is cut ! " She was crying . " Oh , look what 's happened to you , " she said . She spoke in Aramaic , our tongue which we did n't speak very much . <br> " I 'm not hurt , " I said . I meant to say it did n't matter . Again my cousins pressed close , Salome smiling as if to say she knew I could bring him back to life , and I took her hand and squeezed it . <br> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teacher came into the room backwards with his hands up . Someone ripped the curtain away and the light was very bright . Joseph and his brothers came in . And so did Cleopas . All of us had to move to make room . <br> " You 're talking about Joseph and Cleopas and Alphaeus , what do you mean drive them out ! " said the Teacher to the whole crowd . " They 've been with us for seven years ! " <br> The angry family of Eleazer came almost into the room . The father himself did come into the room . <br> " Yes , seven years and why do n't they go back to Galilee , all of them ! " Eleazer 's father shouted . " Seven years is too long ! That boy is possessed of a demon and I tell you my son was dead ! " <br> " Are you complaining that he 's alive now ! What 's the matter with you ! " demanded my uncle Cleopas . <br> Continues ...         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
