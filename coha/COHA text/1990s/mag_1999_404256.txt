Becoming a smart self-advocate in medical matters Photograph Mary Elizabeth McNary , who was diagnosed with MS in 1992 , and Dr. Heidi Crayton , her neurologist . " The doctor-patient relationship really is a partnership , " said Dr. Crayton. // I have MS and so do many people reading this magazine , but like snowflakes , no two of us are alike . We live with a complicated disease for which there is not yet a cure . One thing we have in common , however , is a need to become good consumers and active self-advocates , persisting in our quest for knowledge about MS and insisting on appropriate medical care . I asked some top MS specialists about the concept of self-advocacy : " The time a patient has with the doctor is necessarily limited , and if the patient leaves his or her brain out in the waiting room , he or she wo n't get what 's needed from the doctor , " said neurologist George Garmany , MD , a member of Associated Neurologists of Boulder , and chair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter " People with MS need to know as much as they can about their disease and their own particular problems . " Stanley van den Noort , MD , is chief medical officer of the National MS Society . He stated the case even more strongly . " It is essential for people with MS to advocate for themselves . Too many people with the disease get run over by the system and are either under-treated or overtreated . This is sometimes due to blind faith in the provider or lack of knowledge . Doctors are sometimes wrong , " he cautioned , " and patients need to take an analytical approach about what is best for them . On the other hand , patients are sometimes eager to grasp at any treatment . Some treatments may lead nowhere , cause harm , and distract everyone from the major issues . " Loren Rolak , MD , director of Neurosciences at the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin , offered this advice : " Question what you are told . Get information from reliable sources . Self-advocacy means being active rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with MS make their feelings and desires known in order to get the care they want and need . " The neurologist may not know a lot about MS , " he said . Some surveys suggest that as many as half of all neurologists in America do n't have a single patient with MS . All 3 of these physicians agreed that neurologists and other physicians vary in their knowledge about MS . And now there is something new : managed care . In the world of managed care Doctors have always had limits , but managed care systems often mandate the amount of time a doctor can spend with an individual patient . " Even in managed care , if people are well informed and vocal-if they keep banging on the door-they will get what they want . It 's the people who give up and go home or flit around from one doctor to another who get lost in the shuffle , " Dr. van den Noort asserted . " In the short term , the easy thing for any medical system , especially managed care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and side effects , there is paperwork , and everything takes time . But MS should be treated because the long-term benefit to the individual and to society is very real . " A balancing act What should people with MS do to find balance between being overly aggressive and being assertive self-advocates ? We know that rigid assertion is often interpreted as belligerence and hostility , and we women especially know that blind , shy obedience gets us no respect at all . Experts tell us that calm assertiveness allows us to be perceived as confident , self-assured adults , but how do we find that middle ground ? I spoke to Nancy Law , LSW who is vice president for Client Programs at the National MS Society . She also lives with a chronic neuromuscular disease . " No one may advocate for you if you do not but being a self-advocate does n't necessarily mean being aggressive , pushy , and obnoxious , " Ms. Law told me . " Some people equate anger with self-advocacy , but you can avoid a lot of anger if you understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every one gives in to you . It means doing some work educating yourself , getting good advice , finding allies , and then figuring out a way to make the system work for you . " Mary Tinker , RN , MA , is the professional education coordinator for the Society 's Colorado Chapter , and she has MS . Because she finds the time in doctors ' offices so short , she writes letters to voice her feelings and establish better relationships . " If I like something the doctor did , I jot a little note of thanks , " she said . Conversely , she will write to ask for clarification , make a suggestion , or register a complaint . She also advises people to remember the nurse . " Nurses are , by professional training , meant to be teachers . Many doctors rely on them to explain , reinforce , and amplify the doctors ' instructions , " she said . As both a person with MS and a professional nurse herself , Ms. Tinker wrote up a Patient Bill of Rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 16 . ) Leaving the comfort zone The demonstrated merits of Avonex , Betaseron , and Copaxone have put the newly diagnosed in a new world where early treatment is possible and important . Gone is the old world in which denial was seen by the professionals as a good coping mechanism , and that 's hard for some with MS . Now we have to try to keep our hopes up while , at the same time , giving ourselves or receiving injections that remind us we have a disease . " MS can be a very lonely experience , especially at first . Few of your acquaintances have had the same experience , " Nancy Law counseled . " MS is tough on self-esteem and image , and sometimes you just do n't know who you are anymore . " To be a good self-advocate , she proposed , ' A person first needs to accept this new selfthe one with MS-as a whole person with all of the rights one ever had before . " Then , she continued , " It 's just as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn how to do it . I tell people to remember that nobody cares as much about yourself as you do . It falls upon you , the person with MS , to become educated . " She is right , although sometimes it seems easier to say than do . Knowledge is power , and if knowledge helps improve life for those of us with MS , it 's time for us to get savvy and smart . " People always have had responsibility for their own medical care . But now this job is more urgent than ever , " Ms. Law said . " Today , early treatment can make a long-term difference . These new drugs do work . This development means people with MS need to move more quickly out of the comfort zone of denial , and face up to what can really happen with MS over the coming years . The Society 's staff and volunteers have a responsibility too . We are here to help people take a look at the information about these new drugs and offer programs that support independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Richert listens . " It makes it easier for us if we 're working with someone who is knowledgeable , " he said . // Nancy Law strongly recommends becoming involved with the nearest Society chapter . " We can offer a new set of ' others ' who may help you feel more comfortable with the changes that MS might bring , " she said . Doctor-patient conflict What if you and a doctor disagree ? Should there be an effort to work through the problem ? Dr. Rolak told me something I have long suspected . ' A lot of neurologists do n't like MS patients , " he admitted . " First , until very recently there was not a lot doctors could do for people with MS , and we like to have patients we can help . If we ca n't , we feel impotent and mortal and frustrated , and our patients are angry or disappointed . " The second reason is just as human . People with MS require a lot of a doctor 's time . We often have multiple health problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor might just rather see a person with one problem , like a migraine headache , " he said . Even so , Dr Rolak agreed that self-advocacy is becoming the general tenor of the time and more doctors today are realizing that their patients can set the standards . And we can set the standards ! While it 's true that doctors are humans with limits , too , we do n't have to let the busy doctor ' syndrome intimidate us . We deserve quality medical care . In fact , the bottom line is our care . Both doctor and patient should be able to communicate even when there is disagreement , Dr. Rolak said . " When they disagree , they should talk and try to come to a resolution if they can-like in a marriage . If that 's really not possible , then they may need a ' divorce ' of sorts . " Mary Tinker concurs . In her Denver-based advocacy group she encourages people with MS to know their options . Even in managed care , people may be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or use the arbitration and grievance procedures . They may even change healthcare plans . The structure of managed care means we must not only be more responsible but more assertive . " If you have any concern that you 've received advice from a managed care doctor that is motivated by a reluctance to pay , you can sometimes strengthen your position if you get a second opinion from an MS specialist . You may have to pay for this out-of-pocket , but it could be well worth your while , " Ms. Law suggested . Dr. Garmany supports this approach . " Your managed care company may authorize a one-time visit to an outside specialist to resolve a conflict . Or you may return to the primary care doctor for an opinion to resolve the conflict . " Society leadership believes it may be helpful to take the insurance company or the physician a copy of the National MS Society 's Disease Management Consensus Statement ( call 1-800-FIGHT MS , option #1 , for assistance with this ) . You may also want to inform your doctor about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see page 29 ) . According to Dr. RolY , the real " red flag " situations are doctors who insist on always being correct , who make up their minds and wo n't consider anything else , or who do n't want you to see anyone else . " If the therapeutic alliance is broken , " Dr. Garmany said , " a patient must change doctors . If the doctor is disrespectful , is not acknowledging a patient 's needs , becomes unprofessional or abusive , or becomes angry at questions asked-then a change must occur . " Being a good self-advocate : preparing for office visits Mary Tinker feels self-advocacy begins with being an efficient health-care consumer . To prepare for a doctor visit , first organize your thoughts to make the most of your limited time , she advises . Lists and diaries will be helpful in remembering questions to ask . Bringing a friend or family member with you may also be helpful . She offers these checklists : Before the visit Why am I going to the doctor ? List problems and symptoms . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Affected or triggered by ? List other concerns . Issues at work ? Handling routine tasks ? Sex and intimacy ? What medications am I taking ? Name ? Dosage ? Side effects ? Do I need my insurance or Medicare card ? During the visit What is the diagnosis ? Do I understand it well enough to explain it to a family member ? If not , ask the doctor to restate . What can be done to improve the situation ? Are any lab or diagnostic tests for me ? Why ? How do I arrange and prepare for them ? Will the doctor call with the results or should I call the office ? Am I to make any changes in diet , exercise , sleep , or stress reduction ? Am I to see another doctor or health-care professional ? Why ? Who ? Are any medications being prescribed ? Name ? Is generic OK ? When taken ? Dosage ? Possible side effects ? Am I to return for another visit ? When ? After the visit , but before leaving the doctor 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures . Review the at-home plan . ( Diet ? Activity level ? Treatments ? Precautions ? ) If not clear , ask the office nurse . Should I report back to the doctor or call the office for any reason ? And later , Ms. Tinker adds , do n't hesitate to call the doctor 's office again if you have questions regarding your treatment plan . Photograph Ed Weiss , diagnosed in 1982 , and Mary Elizabeth McNary see themselves as consumers of MS health care . // It 's an emergency Blurred vision is frightening , but often it 's the temporary result of being overheated . Visual problems and some other MS symptoms can be quite transitory and resolve themselves with a little time . They are n't necessarily emergencies . Others things are or can become emergencies , though , and persons with MS should become aware of the difference . When calling the office in an emergency , it 's important to say why you need an appointment right away . If your problem is compelling but you ca n't be scheduled , ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans require a larger co-payment for emergency room visits if your physician does not send you there . " If you think there is an emergency , you should call , " Dr. Rolak emphasized . " The burden of deciding if this is serious is up to your physician . It helps to know that the main emergencies in MS are infections , high fevers , falling and breaking a bone , or a sudden or dramatic change in symptoms-an attack of MS . " InsideMS will continue to cover this important subject . In the next issue , Ms. Hinson , Smith will investigate self-advocacy , insurance , and entitlement programs . Articles on self-advocacy and self-help , alternative medicine and welLness ; activism in health-care policy ; and self-advocacy and employment are planned for the future .

Sidebar PAM STEBBINS : Living with MS - not against it Pam Stebbins was a librarian with a 3year-old and a newborn baby when her MS was diagnosed 13 years ago . As a professional librarian she had an edge in conducting her own search for information . Her advice to others who want to be good self-advocates includes learning , of course . " But , " she said , " you also have to know what 's going on in your body and keep track of it . Reading about the disease and feeling ' the disease are 2 different things . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what it 's for , why I need it , and if it would make any difference in my treatment . " A person has to learn to live with MS and not against it . You can find a balance between self-help and mainstream medicine . I know my own sensations and my own disease better than my doctors do , " she concluded . " Doctors have the medical knowledge of my disease , but I have the physical knowledge of it . " Sidebar JIM REA : His tools are his freedom In his booklet , " The 3-Minute Guide to MS , Jim Rea wrote that " most disabilities are in the minds of the able-bodied , not the bodies of the disabled . " The booklet includes photographs of Mr. Rea climbing rocks in the western United States , a crutch in each hand . " I have those same photos on my wall at home , next to the one of me and the kids with President Clinton , " he explained . " I saw Mr. Clinton because I have MS Mr. Rea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I hike despite having MS . " Jim Rea 's wicked sense of humor is sprinkled liberally throughout his booklet : " MS is like learning a new game , except every time you think you have figured out how to play , someone changes the rules , " he wrote . When he experiences conflicting opinion among his specialists and primary care givers , he believes the neurologist should be " captain of the ship " . " But if you find yourself avoiding an appointment with a certain health professional , " Mr. Rea advised , " I think that 's a warning sign to seek another doctor . " V H.-S . Sidebar UNSOLICITED ADVICE : BUT THEY MEAN WELL When we are afraid , those who care about us often fear for us and for themselves as well . When we hurt , those closest to us feel pain and helplessness . Sometimes they even try to relieve their pain and anxiety by trying to relieve their pain and anxiety by trying to relieve ours , offering advice we have not asked for and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-advocate and being confident about your own MS is important , " Nancy Law said . The best way to counter well-meaning advice about questionable MS treatment is to be well inform ed . On this , all the specialists I consulted agreed . The situation can be especially tricky if the person giving advice is important to you , Dr. Garman noted . " Those who say they know of a cure or can cure you may not know any better , or they may be dishonest . When friends and family offer advice , listen , compare it to your own needs , but if you ca n't determine whether it 's worthwhile based on that , go to your other resources for more information and advice .
