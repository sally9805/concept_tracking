<p> NOSTALGIA sometimes takes two tracks . It can bring smiles or tears of some happy time conjured up in the mind , edited for comfort with all the sharp edges removed , leaving only cheery content of our bygone times . <p> But it can also leave one with a desperate unfullfilled yearning , like an argument with a lost friend that was never resolved . <p> Of all the things that I missed when I emigrated to the United States it was my beloved city of London . It was the London of grimy , gritty streets , of faded Victorian grandeur , and a harlequin of social levels . My nostalgia ( the negative variety ) for my birthplace reached its peak in the ' 60s . Not only did I miss London the most during that time , but events in the United States seemed only to serve my contention that London was the only place worth living in . <p> Over the years , this yearning has abated somewhat . But last Christmas , I decided to go back and see just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The London I sought was not that London of the tourist or travel agency . I knew that Tower Bridge , the Houses of Parliament , and Buckingham Palace were still there . I knew that London 's distinctive red double-decker buses still ran , and that the British still drove on the left . <p> What I looked for was the London of the ordinary person , the working , bustling London that was so much the backdrop to my childhood . I returned to look for the period set against a background which was largely shabby and ravaged , full of bomb sites and dereliction , and yet which was somehow authentic , vital , and tough . It was a London where no high buildings spoiled the Westminster and city skyline ; cars were always black ; there were no plastic signs , and Georgian terraces were properly grimy with dark-painted woodwork unimproved by middle-class tastes . It was a London which I knew very well as a child ; hauntingly beautiful in its own way . Did it still exist ? <p> I started to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my childhood . The street was still there , but it had been " gentrified . " Trees had been planted on the narrow pavement , now full grown and pressing against the cleanup brickwork of the small terraced houses . Newly created citizens of Britain had stuccoed and painted those once staid and dispassionate dwellings with a variety of exotic colors and styles . It was exciting and brought color to a once-quiet street , but it was not the London I was looking for . <p> I found it around Kings Cross station . Here is an area that has received only the most cosmetic of change since Victorian times . Here , surely , I could find what I was looking for . It was from Kings Cross station that I was first evacuated from Hitler 's bombs . <p> It was a Kings Cross train that took me to the moors of Yorkshire for my military service , and it was from Cubitt 's once yellow-bricked station with its grand proportions and twin train sheds that I traveled to Welwyn Garden City , courting my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew so well as a child . The late Georgian atmosphere is still much in evidence , a pattern of ordinary , shabby brick terraced houses which are the real stuff of London . It was into this dense urban fabric that the Victorians , with the typical ruthlessness of American interstate highway builders , cut their railways . Here among the Victorian weft and woof of brick and cobblestone , the Great Northern and Midland railways thrust their main line termini . <p> It is this contrast , this contest of styles that makes the area exciting and dramatic : the abrupt change in scale between ordinary London streets and two of the greatest monuments of the Railway Age . But the wonderful thing was that hardly anything had changed . It was a living , breathing museum of sorts , full of people and traffic and everyday life . <p> Here was the junction of Pentonville Road and Grays Inn Road , anchored by London 's version of a " flatiron " building , with its tottering fake minaret . Here , too , were the old shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hamburger chains and ethnic variety stores . <p> I walked up Pentonville Road for a short distance . I wanted to see if the vista from John O'Connor 's famous 1884 painting , " St. Pancras at Sunset , " was still there . It was , although marred by a plethora of boxy modern buildings . But the basic view down the Pentonville Road , stoppered by the outline of the monster railway terminus , remained intact . <p> And somehow this whole area has largely survived slum-clearance , wartime bombing , and postwar planning . I am certain that is why , in the early ' 50s , Ealing Studios chose the King 's Cross locale as the real-life setting for that wonderful , gently funny film , " The Ladykillers . " <p> I returned to Kings Cross again , but this time I headed to the area north . I remembered this as a vast area filled with smoke and the screech of railway engines ' whistles . In this weird , exotic domain , I remember watching endless trains of potatoes from Lincolnshire , coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lancashire entering the huge goods yard - one of dozens serving the capital . The surreal desolation of the Victorian railway landscape was still there , but the activity was n't . <p> I began to feel like the prodigal son returning to his father 's house . I had gone to live the life of a higher standard , in comfortable , wealthy America and found something wanting . I felt that , in some way , I had spent my heritage of Victorian outlines , Gothic spires , and industrial gasholders ; of streets where front doors met those passing by on the sidewalk ; of social architecture and of empirical enterprise . <p> I wandered along the banks of the Grand Union canal , its fittings of locks and wharfs still intact . I stood by the Great Northern 's granary building , remembering the shouts of laborers and the shrill locomotive whistles . It was silent now , but that once-painful nostalgia now stood me in good stead , and I was able to fill in the blank spaces of the desolation with commercial activity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this complex and historical area - criss-crossed by canals , railways , and black-sooted tunnels , and full of coal drops and warehouses that still contained the smell of spices and exotic goods - had a strange beauty . <p> This might seem inexcusable nostalgia , but derelict urban landscapes can have an incredible aura . The late Ian Nairn appreciated this when he wrote in his book " Ian Nairn 's London " : " The whole of this place at the back of ( Kings Cross ) is incredibly moving : tunnels , perspectives , trains on the skyline , roads going allways . If you get nothing from it at first , stay there until something happens : it is really worth the effort . " <p> That 's exactly what was happening to me . As I stood there in that no-man's-land of industrial atrophy , something was happening . I realized now that my memories of London became a mental malady for me because I tried to constantly compare it with something else - with New York , or the Boston subway , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just like each person , cities and places grow according to their own circumstances and their own histories . <p> CITIES have individualities too . And as with human beings , our memories of them are what we want to remember , what we appreciate about them that influenced us . We recall what set our values for a lifetime and remember with affection and warmth , not with a sense of loss or penalty . <p> You see , part of the problem was that I thought that my nostalgic memories of London had to be soft and sentimental . Now I know that its survival from the planner and the idealist , from grand gestures and centralization , is part of its real character . <p> I had gotten all I could from old movies , books , and reminiscences with friends . Now I knew that I had to see it in a way that only the years could add to , with fresh eyes . <p> If the sentimentality has gone , perhaps some regret has remained . Regret that this industrial wilderness I have rediscovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own time comes to be replaced , will be remembered with as much affection and tenderness as I have for this grainy , cockney city within a city . <p> When I returned to America I knew that if I never went back again , I would remember my part of London as I should remember it - as one remembers an old friend . After all these years , only the good remains . Like James McNeil Whistler , I see that " ... the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky , and the tall chimneys become campanili , and the warehouses are palaces in the night , and the whole city hangs in the heavens ...
