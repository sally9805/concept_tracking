Lee Lorenz , the longtime cartoon editor of the New Yorker , has confirmed my suspicions : the magazine is running fewer and fewer cartoons featuring bearded men in white robes holding placards emblazoned with some variation on the end is near . This strikes me as odd since , at least from a strictly millennial point of view , the end is near . Should n't we be seeing more of these guys , both in real life and breaking up the gray columns of Joe Klein articles ? " It 's just one of those cartoon cliches that are pretty well played out , " Lorenz says . " It 's like desert-island cartoons . You always think you 're never going to want to publish another one . " True , and the same probably goes for **28;5344;TOOLONG cartoons . <P> And yet the decline of the prophet cartoon also seems to coincide with my sense that , the infectious enthusiasm of crazy comet cults notwithstanding , the new millennium is itself well on the way to becoming played out . For those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fire fight with the new world order , the big rollover is shaping up as the Super Bowl of infrequent calendrical events : overblown and unsatisfying in equal proportion , the last in a long line of 20th century hot-air generators . Newspapers and magazines have already struck up regular millennium sections ; special issues are in the works , as are numerous book and TV specials  --  if you loved the pack hunt for meaning in the 25th anniversary of Woodstock or the death of Jackie O. , you 'll love 2000 . Merchandisers are horning in too : La-Z-Boy offers Millennia office chairs ( the " tie-in , " a La-Z-Boy executive offers , is that the chairs have " a very contemporary look " ) , while Elizabeth Arden has its Millenium skin-care products . A brochure explains the connection to exfoliation : " In the present and future of every skin , there is a turning point  --  where it begins to appear tired , dry and older-looking . But now there is an alternative . Millenium . " <P> " The whole millennium thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is producing a millennial extravaganza for abc and thus knows whereof he speaks . " But , " Halmi continues , " just try to make a reservation for New Year 's Eve 1999 at any of the landmark restaurants around the world . It 's sold out . So obviously the hype works . " In that spirit , ABC asked Halmi , the chairman of Hallmark Entertainment , to come up with something about " what the year 2000 means . " A tough question , so Halmi has passed the buck to 10 of America 's leading playwrights  --  John Guare , Larry Gelbart , David Mamet , Steve Martin , Elaine May , Terrence McNally , Arthur Miller , Neil Simon , Wendy Wasserstein and August Wilson  --  each of whom will contribute a teleplay about the millennium that will be broadcast during a single week of the November 1999 sweeps . <P> At least two of the playwrights seem to be duly flummoxed by the nebulousness of the assignment . When asked what the year 2000 means , Gelbart , after some extemporizing , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wilson sees the millennium as offering humanity " a clean slate , " although he 's unsure what that might mean in practice . It will be interesting to see what these artists come up with , and whether any of their pieces will prove that this subject is n't , in fact , best handled by the makers of skin-care products .
