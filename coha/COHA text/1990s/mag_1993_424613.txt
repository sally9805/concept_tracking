Section : U.S. News ; Cover story How Eunice Shriver and her family changed the world for the mentally retarded <p> Not long after John Kennedy entered the White House in 1961 , his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver began one of the most heartfelt campaigns any Kennedy ever undertook . She argued to family members that it would be immensely helpful if they revealed one of their most closely guarded secrets : that one of their own , the president 's sister Rosemary , was mentally retarded . It took more than a year to bring the idea to fruition , and it finally won sanction after the clan 's two central figures blessed it : Patriarch Joseph Kennedy made clear he could live with the disclosure as long as President Kennedy supported it . In the spring of 1962 , Eunice told JFK she wanted to write a piece for the Saturday Evening Post about Rosemary , and he responded : That 's fine . Let me see it first . ' The article appeared in the September 22 issue , and it was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the nation . <p> What is stunning about the Kennedys '  --  and most particularly Eunice Shriver 's  --  role in changing the way the world treated mentally retarded people is how little noticed it has been . It is difficult to recall today the life such people faced in the generation before Kennedy 's administration . Scores of thousands were warehoused in institutions located in the most remote sites available . That was especially true of women because it was thought to be important to keep them from getting pregnant and creating another generation of idiots , morons , imbeciles '  --  all terms of scientific precision used to classify different levels of retardation . One surgery textbook recommended that mongols ' ( those with Down 's syndrome ) not be given life-saving procedures because , the text implied , they were subhuman , and some were allowed to die . <p> Families like the Kennedys that kept retarded family members at home as they grew up were the objects of considerable scorn . Rosemary was born at the height of the worldwide flu epidemic in 1918 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively mild retardation , it became a difficult fact of life by the time she reached school age . Though the family tried to make things as normal as possible for her , she fell far behind in the hypercompetitive environment as she got older . As she became a young woman , her problems grew and she began to lash out violently on occasion . <p> The lobotomy . TEventually , Joseph Kennedy was told that there was a miracle ' surgical procedure called a prefrontal lobotomy that could help Rosemary . Without consulting anyone else in the family , he ordered the operation in 1941 and it was botched . The surgery was supposed to leave her mental functions relatively intact while eliminating her aggressive behavior . Instead , it rendered her zombielike and she was moved to St. Coletta 's in Jefferson , Wis. , where she still resides . Until Eunice 's magazine article , the family told inquiring reporters that she was in a convent . Joseph Kennedy was tormented by the fate of his daughter . In 1946 , he created the Joseph P. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to help retarded people , and in the mid-1950s , he asked Eunice to determine how the foundation 's grants could best be used . She traveled the nation talking to the small number of experts willing to buck the forget-'em philosophy and visiting the notorious snake pits ' that housed most retarded Americans . There was a complete lack of interest in them and lack of knowledge about their capacities , ' she says . They were isolated because their families were embarrassed and the public was prejudiced . ' <p> Not surprisingly , Eunice Shriver  --  the one family member who continued to call her big brother Jack ' after his election  --  hammered at the issue as JFK entered the presidency . He responded by setting up a task force headed by eminent educator Leonard Mayo to devise a legislative program to attack mental retardation . The president named White House deputy special counsel Myer Feldman to work with Eunice and the panel . <p> Eunice Shriver was clearly the commander of the administration effort . When her friend and panel member Robert E. Cooke suggested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final plan . She and Feldman helped broker disputes on the panel between the hard ' scientists , who thought retardation was best addressed as a genetic and prenatal problem , and their soft ' colleagues , who favored an emphasis on education to help improve the lives of retarded people . She also helped arrange the necessary support from congressional leaders , although that task was not very difficult : Most knew that the president cared deeply about the issue . JFK even broke away from one of the emergency meetings on the Cuban missile crisis on Oct. 15 , 1962 , to receive the panel 's report . ( More than 70 percent of its 112 recommendations were eventually implemented . ) <p> As political leaders began to change their thinking , Eunice felt the public still lagged behind . She and her husband , Sargent Shriver , persuaded the Advertising Council to devise newspaper and magazine ads in early 1962 . But she thought the single most powerful act to capture public attention was the revelation about Rosemary . <p> Journalist David Gelman was asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran it like a campaign , ' he says . There was a brain trust of experts at the ready , and she kept piling boxes near me of material to cram into the piece . Everybody was really nervous about the piece . But she was determined to knock down all the competitor afflictions when it came to getting government funding . ' In August , Gelman watched as President Kennedy speed-read through his copy , offered a few suggestions and gave his blessing . <p> A goal realized . As Eunice Shriver predicted , the change in public and scientific attitudes prompted by the article and the work of the presidential panel was striking . Over the next generation , the Kennedys ' goal  --  to bring the retarded into the mainstream of American life  --  has been largely realized . Research breakthroughs on the causes of retardation and beneficial educational programs have proliferated , thanks to the funding launched in the Kennedy administration . American life and the lives of the retarded have been incalculably enriched by the drive to bring the retarded into full participation in communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first efforts are equally impressive . The family campaign to bring the retarded out of the closet , including the Shrivers ' creation of the widely hailed Special Olympics , was a precursor of the larger disability rights movement . And Sargent Shriver says his inspiration to create the much admired Head Start program for disadvantaged children came from his familiarity with research that early-intervention educational efforts could raise the IQs of the retarded . <p> When the full judgment of the Kennedy legacy is made  --  including JFK 's Peace Corps and Alliance for Progress , Robert Kennedy 's passion for civil rights and Ted Kennedy 's efforts on health care , workplace reform and refugees  --  the changes wrought by Eunice Shriver may well be seen as the most consequential . With a lot of help from her very powerful brother Jack and inspiration from her powerless sister Rosemary , Eunice Shriver helped move the nation for good and for all . <p> PHOTO : October 1963 .
