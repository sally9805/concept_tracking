STATE OF THE UNION // On the warm evening of July 12 , in the exciting Chicago summer of 1893 , Frederick Jackson Turner , a young history don at the University of Wisconsin , rose to speak before a stellar audience of international scholars . The setting was superb , the extravaganza of the World 's Columbian Exposition , America 's self-conscious debut commemorating four hundred years of progress since Christopher Columbus claimed the New World for the king and queen of Spain . Here on the shores of Lake Michigan , a gleaming white and gilt beaux arts temporary city rose to herald the remarkable achievements of the bursting new colossus of the Western Hemisphere . World-traveled tourists marveled at the breathtaking exhibits attesting to the social and technical advancement of the United States . Everything , from the giant Corliss electric dynamo , to George Washington Ferris 's 250-foot wheel , to the hootchy-kootchy girls of the " Egyptian Village , " brought wide eyes and gaping mouths to tens of thousands of parasoled and straw-hatted tourists . " We were all knocked silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It beats the brag so far out of sight that even Chicago is dumb . " Historian Henry Adams , grandson and great-grandson of presidents , called the fair " the first great expression of American thought as a unity . " // Compared to these manufactured wonderments , it 's no surprise that Professor Turner 's learned address , " The Significance of the Frontier in American History , " got so little attention in the public journals , or indeed , even among his fellow historians . Federal civil service commissioner Theodore Roosevelt , no mean historian himself and a man who understood before a good many others the significance of what became the " Turner thesis " of American history , sent a polite congratulatory note : " I think you have struck some first class ideas , and have put into definite shape a good deal of thought which has been floating around rather loosely . " // To present the " frontier " as a driving catalyst of American history , Turner lifted a virtually unnoticed passage of enormous significance from the U.S. Census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until the national census of 1880 , the social and political map of the United States stopped at a frontier line of settlement , a pale , beyond which its statutes and civilization did not cross . A decade later , the bureau declared this unwrought world " so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line .... It can not , therefore , any longer have a place in the census reports . " The frontier had vanished in law as well as in fact . // Turner grounded his thesis on American economic power generated by " free land . " America 's unique individualism , nationalism , political institutions , its very democracy , depended on it . " So long as free land exists , " he told the assembly , " the opportunity for ... competency exists , and economic power secures political power . " For Turner , continental expansion , symbolized by the ever moving frontier creating more free land , was the driving , dynamic factor of American progress . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau erased the frontier with the keystroke of a typewriter . Without the economic energy created by expanding the frontier , he warned , America 's political and social institutions would stagnate . If one adhered to this way of thinking , America must expand or die . // Even as he spoke , an imbroglio between President Cleveland and the U.S. Senate over the annexation of Hawaii was in high spate , making it an extraordinary time for such observations . Would the United States halt at its saltwater margins ? Must expansion be defined in terms of a terrestrial line across prairie or mountains , or might it include strategic and economic projection across a " free " ocean ? Turner did not say . " And now , " he concluded , " four centuries from the discovery of America ... the frontier is gone , and with its going has closed the first period of American history . " // While Turner 's lucid thesis created hardly an inch of newspaper copy or a poke of interest among contemporary national policymakers , the reverse was true with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan of the U.S. Navy had no qualms about moving the frontier beyond the coastline , and three years before Turner offered his thesis , he made his case . // Born in 1840 at West Point , the son of Mary and " Old Dennis " Hart Mahan , a highly regarded , puritanical Episcopalian professor of mathematics and engineering at the U.S. Military Academy , young Alfred eschewed the army life and graduated ( number two of twenty ) from the Naval Academy in 1859 . For thirty years , his naval career was drudgingly undistinguished . During the Civil War his sole experience of gunfire occurred when his ship arrived late for his only battle . He was decidedly uncomfortable at sea , a poor sailor and indifferent ship handler  --  hardly the stuff of his hero , the great David Farragut . Though Mahan was an outstanding student and intellect , his first efforts at naval history , the vocation that shot his comet across the celebrity cosmos of the 1890s , was a mind-numbingly dull account of the Civil War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was both Mahan 's and the navy 's good fortune that he caught the notice of Commodore Stephen Bleecker Luce , a broad-whiskered educational reformer during the navy 's sinkhole , post-Civil War dark age . Luce had already established the Naval Apprentice Training System for enlisted sailors , and duty at the Naval Academy provided experience in molding young midshipmen . But Luce chose as his special project the revolutionary conception of graduate study in naval warfare for junior officers . The modern naval officer , Luce believed , could richly profit by a study of naval history , examining wars , leaders , theory , and battles " with the cold eye of professional criticism . " Seeking a distinctly separate institution from the undergraduate Naval Academy , Annapolis , Luce submitted a proposal for a postgraduate Naval War College to the Navy Department in 1876 , and there it languished for eight years . // Then , in October 1884 , shortly after the general reform of the service had gotten under way with modest beginnings , Navy Secretary William E. Chandler , over protests from most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters for Luce 's school in an abandoned almshouse on Coaster 's Harbor Island , by the torpedo station at Newport , Rhode Island . Luce , nearing sixty years old , was appointed its first commandant . " Poor little poor house , " said the commodore to the small group of officers with him . " Poor little poor house , I christen thee the United States Naval War College ! " // Luce had begun his own systematic study of naval history almost twenty years before , in the final months of the Civil War . During that conflict , steam-driven armored warships fought on both sides , heralding eight decades of the " battleship era " in naval history . In the years that followed that war , several ironclad battles had erupted on the world 's oceans , from the Pacific coast of South America to the Black Sea . Yet there were no codified principles on which to forge a canon of the new naval warfare of iron ( soon to be steel ) and steam . Brainy Alfred Thayer Mahan , Luce thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invited him to join the War College faculty . // Of the two subjects Luce proposed for Mahan 's syllabus of instruction , naval tactics and naval history , it was the second that gave Mahan " more anxiety . " But in the summer of 1884 , he could not have been further removed from the intellectual ferment beginning to bubble up slowly within the service . Mahan commanded the Wachusett , a twenty-year-old Civil War wooden screw-sloop , on her last commission before being sent to the knacker 's yard . // In the isolation of the far Pacific station , Mahan plumbed the well of naval history , " continuously seeking " the elusive thread that bound ancient and modern maritime empires , their admirals , galleons , ships of the line , and sea battles into a cohesive , encompassing historical theory . Aboard the tired Wachusett there came to him " from within , the suggestion that the control of the sea was an historic factor which had never been systematically appreciated and expounded . " This was the nut , the kernel of Mahanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy councils for decades into the next century . // In October 1885 , Mahan , newly promoted to captain , reported to Rear Admiral Luce at the War College . A year later , he succeeded to the presidency . Ignoring the sniping that constantly pinged around the college from the mossback element in the Navy Department , Mahan buried himself in research at the New York Public Library , trying to formulate basic principles governing the art and science of naval warfare . Eventually , his concept of the history of sea power was not a simple chronology of campaigns and battles , or even an examination of tactics ; instead , it concentrated on the elements that combined to make a nation powerful at sea : trade , geography , natural resources , diplomacy and naval policy , the character of the people and their government . By the autumn of 1886 , Mahan had synthesized his research into a series of lectures , which he delivered to an audience of twenty student officers at the War College . Occasional speakers from the civilian world complemented the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just written a well-accepted , creditable history , The Naval War of 1812 ; this was Theodore Roosevelt . Both men took an instant liking to each other . // In September 1887 , at the beginning of Mahan 's second year at the War College , he was convinced that his lectures might equally serve as naval history for a mainstream book publisher . Not only would theories on the development of modern naval warfare be presented to the public , but publication , said Admiral Luce , would " assist the college " in its continuing bureaucratic and financial struggle " for bare existence . " The Boston house of Little , Brown , and Company was persuaded to undertake the project , offering Mahan an advance of $2,500 . In May 1890 , the lectures , bolstered with a hefty introduction , appeared under the title The Influence of Sea Power upon History , 1660-1783. // As a work of historical prose , the book was an improvement on the pedantic yawner that had previously come from Mahan 's pen . Yet it was not the four hundred-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , but its introduction , " Elements of Sea Power , " written as a marketing tool and designed , Mahan frankly admitted , to make the book " more popular , " an " attractive subject to the public . " Basing his introductory theme on the contemporary condition of the United States , an industrial complex manifestly capable of producing vast surpluses , Mahan held the mirror of history for his countrymen to see in their reflection England at the seventeenth-century beginnings of her maritime empire . Each possessed characteristics that in Mahan 's view were vital to the growth of a modern naval , indeed world , power . // First , strategic geography . Unlike certain maritime states , France or the Netherlands , for instance , the United States need not worry about protecting a landed frontier that drained manpower and resources better suited for overseas expansion . // Second , physical geography . A nation embarking on a course for sea power needed extensive coastlines , deep , protected harbors , and a fertile agricultural interior . The United States held all in abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inborn love of the sea . " Until the post-Civil War maritime doldrums , the United States had been a great seafaring nation , and it was time to rekindle the spirit . // Fourth , the establishment of a large merchant marine . America 's carrying trade had once rivaled Great Britain 's in tonnage and prestige . But that had ended for all time at the hands of Confederate sea raiders during the Civil War . ( Mahan soon realized this as false doctrine . A nation no longer needed to ship products under her own flag to become commercially prosperous ; it need only have a navy capable of protecting the goods and vessels. ) // Fifth , national character . The people of a maritime state must be materially acquisitive , with a knack and yearning for profitable overseas trade , and generally " love money . " Americans held these traits  --  indeed , held them rather high . To Mahan , the full flowering of these national qualities was held in check by the " legislative hindrances " of those distinctly unwilling to expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Mahan granted that the governments of several historically great maritime powers , Carthage and Spain for example , had been particularly despotic , and it was infinitely more desirable to have a participatory political structure . " In the matter of sea power , the most brilliant successes have followed where there has been intelligent direction by a government fully imbued with the spirit of the people . Such a government , " he observed , " is most certainly secured when the will of the people ... has some share in making it . " England in the late seventeenth century contained the germ of this ideal . The United States in the late nineteenth had arguably progressed somewhat further . // As Mahan reasoned , the theories of history and the reality of the present molded themselves in the America of 1890 . The productive capacity of the nation had grown too large for the strictly continental market to absorb . Further , having lost the landed frontier  --  a political line  --  it must turn to the sea , its ever present , strategic geographical frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier against European entanglements , Mahan compared them to " a great ocean highway ; or better , of a wide common , over which men pass in all directions . " // Mahan charted America 's imperial passage away from the mercantilism of European maritime empires such as Great Britain , the Netherlands , and Spain . Their colonies were mainly sources for raw materials , and markets and outlets for manufacturing and human surplus . These outposts of empire , be they at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River , the Cape of Good Hope , Havana , or Manila Bay , naturally assumed the roles of distant naval stations to service the colonial trade and , latterly , for local defense . // Mahan separated these functions and reversed their polarity . It is a given , he said , that colonies are markets , both outlets and nursery for home industry and commerce , but this is not their true value . That lies in what was formerly taken for granted , their role as strategic naval bases . Military conflict between nation-states will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world is enormously important . Whatever the reason for the strife , Mahan stated , " when a question arises of control over distant regions ... whether they be crumbling empires , anarchical republics , colonies , isolated military posts , or small islands , it must ultimately be decided by naval power . " It was so in the British defense of Gibraltar , a strategic outpost purely , and it would be so when the United States acquired the way for its linchpin of empire , the Central American isthmian canal . Naval power , not the marching thousands of conscript armies , would decide these contests. // Whereas Frederick Jackson Turner talked of closure , Mahan clearly understood the beginnings of an America dominant in a new , dangerously opportunistic world . Writing in 1890 , Turner 's benchmark year , Mahan , too , identified the disappearance of the frontier as a milestone of American history , with large implications for its economic and political future . In a companion piece to The Influence of Sea Power , he closed the circle of Turner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether they will or no , Americans must now begin to look outward . " // The Influence of Sea Power upon History , translated into a dozen languages , exploded like a 12-inch shell on the naval and geopolitical world . Only the U.S. Navy Department turned a blind eye . " It is not the business of a naval officer to write books , " said leading mossback Commodore Francis M. Ramsay , chief of the Bureau of Navigation , and he shipped Mahan off to sea in command of the new steel cruiser Chicago . But in Great Britain , Germany , and Japan , the book found wide audiences , and indeed , planted the poisonous seed of the Anglo-German naval rivalry that became a root cause of World War I. Kaiser Wilhelm ordered a copy placed aboard every ship of the growing Imperial German Navy . // Certainly there were many midlevel and junior officers in the Navy Department who knew its significance . Those who sought reform came away impressed . Admiral Luce thought it " altogether exceptional . " An enthusiastic Theodore Roosevelt wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by far the most interesting book on naval history which has been produced on either side of the water for many a long year . " The Chicago Times assured its readers that Mahan was assuredly no " crank . " // And what of the America of Turner and Mahan , so ready to break its continental boundaries and burst on the international stage as a feature player in the great game of empire ? These were peculiar and pregnant times . The Civil War had ended a quarter century before . Its history had been written , sectional and social passions had faded , the pain and gore of battlefields and gun decks had been forgotten ; its great public figures passed into retirement or the grave . One of Mark Twain 's minor works , The Gilded Age , contained the character of " Colonel " Beriah Sellers , an entrepreneurial braggart whose hollow standards and materialistic dreams painted , in broad strokes , the era between the Civil and Spanish-American Wars . The book 's title was a very apt term , for gilding is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation elected the Fifty-first Congress  --  the " Billion-Dollar Congress , " the first to ever spend a billion dollars during peacetime . When someone used the nickname to taunt the new Speaker of the House , Republican Thomas B. " Czar " Reed of Maine , he rejoined , " Yes , but this is a billion dollar country ! " // Reed was guilty of understatement . The national wealth in 1890 topped $65 billion , higher than Great Britain 's , or Germany 's and Russia 's combined . The new America entering the decade craned its urban neck at the first iron-skeleton skyscrapers ; incandescent light was no longer a novelty and , along with electric " trolleys , " was rapidly replacing the gas lamp and horsecar on America 's streets . The telephone was coming into use in the business world , and the navy installed an experimental system in the steel cruiser Philadelphia . On December 15 , 1890 , Sitting Bull died in a firefight with reservation police on the Grand River in South Dakota . Five days later came the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Indian wars . Utah renounced polygamy as a preliminary to statehood . The navy , if any civilian noticed , was rising slowly from the status of the joke fleet into which it had degenerated since the Civil War . Two small battleships , the Texas and the Maine , were already under construction . // The population stood at 75 million , a 50 percent increase in ten years , largely due to waves of immigrants , most from eastern and southern Europe and a fair number from Japan . " Wall Street " and its " interests " were established phenomena of American commercial growth , generating a boom of industrial jobs , along with financial " panics " almost on a programmed schedule . Great city slums were spawned , and in contrast , greedy monopoly trusts arose , hoarding and manipulating the wealth of railroads , mines , iron and steel , beef and sugar in the bank accounts of the new industrial plutocracy . Already in 1890 a groping public consciousness had aroused Congress to pass Ohio senator John Sherman 's " anti-trust act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And at the opposite economic end of Wall Street came the contentious birth of industrial labor unions . To meet their threat , state National Guards and sometimes the regular army were called in to suppress them in the name of law and order . // The dry prairie states and the cotton-growing South suffered under the increasing burdens of erratic industrial prosperity . Economic growth since the Civil War had been wildly uneven . For the farmers , agricultural prices never seemed able to keep up with costs , and increasingly they turned to radical solutions to ease the down-spiraling plight . " In God we trusted , in Kansas we busted " read painted signs on wagons heading east . The " farm problem " became a chronic national agony . When farmers had a bumper crop , commodity prices sank to no-profit levels , and in drought or grasshopper years , farmers went broke anyway . By 1890 a significant proportion of the original homesteaders had sold out or quit . Class lines were drawn between the consuming , banking East and their dirt cousins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Billion-Dollar Congress sent Benjamin Harrison , stalwart Republican lawyer of Indiana , to the White House . " A frigid little general " with a fine Civil War record , good brains , and an unshakable devotion to the Grand Old Party , he was described by a visitor as " the only man he ever knew who could carry a piece of ice in each pants pocket on a July afternoon and never lose a drop . " While the candidate stayed home in Indianapolis , the campaign was dominated by the charge that Grover Cleveland 's incumbent Democrats were out to kill the protectionist tariff and American industry with it . Manufacturers were " fried " by Republican fund-raisers for over $4 million in political " fat " that was lavishly spread in critical states . It worked , and Harrison squeaked through the electoral college with a sixty-five-vote majority . // Benjamin Harrison and his first secretary of state , James G. Blaine , were frankly expansionist , though nothing directly would come of their efforts during their tenure in office . In the navy , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , in Mahanian terms , the engine of U.S. expansion . Harrison 's navy secretary , Benjamin Franklin Tracy of New York , a former Civil War brigadier and U.S. attorney in Brooklyn , continued the line of sound navy administrators begun when President Garfield had named William H. Hunt to the post in 1881 , and it was due to the efforts of such men that the pattern of attrition and stagnation began to change . // At the end of the Civil War , the U.S. Navy ranked first in the world : seven hundred vessels mounting five thousand guns , with a modern , revolutionary fleet of ironclad monitors unmatched afloat . But within months of peacetime , the nation turned inward to settle the frontier and get on with Reconstruction . There followed sixteen years of the " dark ages " of the old navy . The service bottomed out to less than seventy steamers and a world ranking of twelfth , behind China and Chile . The monitors were laid up to rust in the navy yards , officer promotions stagnated , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Jackson 's presidency . // Technological experimentation did not exist . ( When Captain Mahan reported as commanding officer to the Wachusett , he described her as an " old war-horse , not yet turned out to grass or slaughter , ship-rigged to the royals , and slow-steamed . " ) In part , the cause was endemic political corruption in the sleepy navy yards , usually attributable to the district congressman . // In 1873 , the navy had been utterly humiliated by Spain in the notorious Virginius affair . A small iron steamer , with an American captain and dubious American registry , the Virginius was illegally running guns and guerrillas to Cuba during the independence struggle known as the Ten Years ' War . Captured by a Spanish gunboat , she was taken to Santiago de Cuba and declared a pirate . The American captain and 52 of her officers , crew , and " passengers " were put against a wall and summarily shot . The remainder , 155 men , would likely have met the same fate were it not for the arrival of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Navy , under Civil War hero Admiral David Dixon Porter , mobilized to meet the crisis , and all available ships assembled at Key West . Rear Admiral Robley Evans , then a lieutenant , remembered , " The force collected ... was the best , and indeed about all we had ... and if it had not been so serious it would have been laughable to see our condition . We remained several weeks , making faces at the Spaniards 90 miles away at Havana , while two modern vessels of war would have done us up in 30 minutes . We were dreadfully mortified over it all . " Diplomatic intervention prevented a Spanish-American war . Spain , with ill grace , came up with an indemnity of eighty thousand dollars , allowing the United States to forget the incident . // In 1881 , however , the navy 's condition started slowly to improve . During the short-lived Garfield administration , Congress refused to authorize ever more costly repairs for what had become floating museum pieces , and two years later , it authorized funds for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the small protected cruisers Atlanta , Boston , and Chicago , and the dispatch vessel Dolphin  --  the " ABCD " ships , the first U.S. naval vessels built of steel . In 1886 , at the urging of Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney , Congress wisely stipulated that all armor plate , structural steel , gunnery , and propulsion components be of domestic manufacture , guaranteeing a symbiotic relationship between the infant American heavy industries and the new navy , the birth of the modern military-industrial complex . In September 1888 , just prior to the election of the Billion-Dollar Congress , Congress passed the largest naval appropriation since the Civil War . For around $16 million , the nation received an aggregate of 27,436 tons of new warships that included the armored cruiser New York , the protected cruiser Olympia , five smaller cruisers , and a Naval Academy practice gunboat. // The Samoa crisis that unfolded in the winter of 1888-89 added further impetus to the development of the new navy . Relationships between Germany , Great Britain , and the United States neared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific islands . Rumors of a clash between American and German ships brought a flurry of war talk and once more turned public and legislative attention to the navy 's unreadiness . It was nature , in the form of a gigantic hurricane on March 16 , 1889 , that calmed the diplomatic waters . Of the three obsolete wooden American naval vessels in Apia Harbor , the Trenton and the Vandalia ( ships similar to Mahan 's creaking Wachusett ) were a total loss . Fifty-one American sailors died . The United States was left , as the New York Herald reported , " with almost no ... war vessels worthy of the name in the Pacific Ocean . " The disaster provided an excellent argument for accelerating the naval construction program . // Then came the Chilean war scare , a crisis of the first order . Through 1890 and 1891 , Chile was enmeshed in a civil war between presidential and congressional factions , with the latter eventually gaining the upper hand . For slights true and imagined , it held decidedly anti-American sentiments . On the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , premeditated incident in the harbor of Valparaiso . The new steel cruiser Baltimore , skippered by Captain Winfield Scott Schley , an officer of some note and ability , was at anchor there . Many of her crew were on shore , and , in one of the city 's saloons , a fight erupted when a Chilean spat in the face of an American sailor . The brawl spread ; police stood aside , except when they joined the mob . The locals dragged two sailors from a streetcar . One , after being stabbed , was shot and killed by police ; the other died after receiving eighteen knife wounds in the back . Thirty-six sailors , eighteen seriously injured , were arrested and beaten at police stations . The episode was a national insult , and the American ( and Chilean ) press demanded war . Conflict was a real possibility , and President Harrison was all for it . But the Chileans yielded , tendering a grudging apology and seventy-five thousand dollars to the families of the two killed American sailors . Interest in American naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power neared completion , Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy was similarly absorbed in writing his first annual report . Released by the department in December 1889 , it is one of the most revolutionary documents in the history of American naval policy . Defense , he cautioned , not conquest , was the object ; but it required a " fighting force , " and the navy did n't have one . The ABCD ships and their immediate successors  --  and even the big armored cruisers New York and Brooklyn , then nearing completion  --  were simply scouts and commerce destroyers , unable to " prevent a fleet of hostile ironclads from shelling our cities . " To raise a blockade of its coasts , or to " beat off the enemy 's fleet on its approach , " America required " armored battleships . " Embracing the as yet unpublished Mahanian principles , Tracy concluded that naval war , " though defensive in principle , may be conducted most effectively by being offensive in its operations . " // On the theory that if he asked for everything , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended building " two fleets of battleships , " twelve for the Atlantic , eight for the Pacific , plus sixty fast cruisers . To stroke the ultraconservatives in the department and the handwringers from congressional coastal districts , he further requested twenty useless monitor-type coast-defense vessels . // To put real bone and sinew into the fleet , the navy 's congressional partisans endorsed the portion of Tracy 's report that established battleship fleets in both oceans , but nowhere near the secretary 's inflated numbers . The bill for the " Increase of the Navy " that came out of the Billion-Dollar Congress provided funds for three " sea-going coastline battle ships designed to carry the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance , " one commerce-raiding cruiser , and a torpedo boat . Following Tracy 's dictum for a two-ocean fleet , the act stipulated that one battleship be constructed on the West Coast . // The reason for the battleships ' oxymoronic " sea-going coast-line " designation was basely political . The " coast-line " designation was plugged into the bill to placate those who feared the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds only for a service whose duties were strictly confined to coast defense . Indeed , strong opposition to the battleships came from a wide range of the politically conscious population : Quaker pacifists , midwestern and southern " small navy " congressmen , commerce-raiding enthusiasts with their eyes glued to the War of 1812 and the need for coastal and merchant shipping defenses , and antiexpansionist Democrats who knew an offensive weapon when they saw one . // Very few of the national legislators who voted for passage understood what they had actually done . Advocates still spoke in terms of coast defense and commerce raiding as the true mission of the navy . Republican senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts , a leading expansionist posing as a naval authority , asserted with palpable inaccuracy that the battleships were no deviation from tradition , were " merely the continuance " of American naval policy from the War of 1812 " and consistently followed since . " // Precisely the opposite : The naval appropriations act of 1890 irrevocably stamped congressional endorsement on a radical departure in America 's philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense of seaports , nor dash out in cruisers to overhaul fat merchant prizes . The battleships were a giant stride , as Tracy and his allies frankly admitted , toward creating a fighting fleet to seize command offensively of the open sea and destroy the enemy in blue water . // When the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland took office in March 1893 , the critical post of navy secretary went to Congressman Hilary Herbert of Alabama , formerly chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee . Hitherto a typically southern small-navy man , he had been turned around by Mahan 's writings , and now endorsed the battleship theory at least as strongly as his Republican predecessor . Under the Tracy-Herbert regimes , Republican and Democratic , the navy transformed itself from a newly awakened agency for national defense into an instrument of diplomatic and military power extending American interests over a significant portion of the globe .
