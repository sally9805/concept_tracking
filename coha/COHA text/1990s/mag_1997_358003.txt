In his mystic forays into the nature of creation , the poet William Blake questioned both the lamb and the tiger about their origins , asking the tiger who it was who could have possibly crafted its " fearful symmetry . " " Did he smile his work to see ? Did he who made the Lamb make thee ? " This year , out of a research institute in Scotland , a lamb named Dolly came roaring similarly existential questions . For Dolly was a clone , and her doubling had a fearful symmetry of a different kind : If sheep could be cloned , could humans be far behind ? <P> Dolly is a carbon copy of her mother , grown from a cell taken from an adult ewe 's mammary gland . The father , in a sense , is embryologist Ian Wilmut , who as a boy wanted to be a farmer but , after a summer of laboratory work , became enchanted by the magical progression of embryos from amorphous balls of cells into living entities of exquisite complexity . In the pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension , human nutrition and health ) , he began experimenting with cloning at Scotland 's Roslin Institute . His vision was the creation of genetically engineered farm animals that would manufacture therapeutic proteins in their milk . At the time , says Wilmut , he was only thinking of cloning embryos . " Dolly was a bonus , " he says , adding , " sometimes when scientists work hard , they also get lucky , and that 's what happened . " <P> The same trick that enabled scientists to clone Dolly could one day be used to clone a human being , a possibility Wilmut finds dismaying . The father of three argues that it is every child 's birthright to be regarded as unique , not a counterfeit version of someone whose strengths and shortcomings have been revealed . The President of the U.S. and the Pontiff in Rome sounded alarms . Laws were debated ; ethical questions raised ; scientists were hauled before legislative panels and warned not to trespass on human territory . But how can one un-know science ?
