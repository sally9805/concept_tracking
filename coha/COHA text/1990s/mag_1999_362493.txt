LIFE ON THE EDGE <P> Your article seems to make " risk takers " the modern equivalent of Greek heroes ADVENTURE , Sept. 6 . But such enthusiasm is an assault on the legions of young Americans striving to build a family and career based on something deeper and more enduring than a dopamine surge of pleasure . The risk takers represent a fringe of our society , and while interesting to a point , they are hardly the leaders of a movement . SEAN P. MAZER New York City <P> Taking risks focuses the mind . Such activities are bracing , to say the least , whether you are a BASE jumper , a surgeon performing a quadruple-bypass operation or an actor executing a sword fight onstage while spouting Shakespeare . Most of us do n't have work that is this invigorating . Engaging in risky activities makes us feel alive . It also satisfies a curiosity about our abilities  --  and how we handle challenges . It can utterly focus your mind . There 's nothing like it . TIM MOFFET Vail , Colo . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valuable lessons of traditional sports  --  teamwork , cooperation , good sportsmanship and collegiality . Is this social progress ? AMY HOPKINS Guilford , Conn . <P> A man does n't know his limits unless he exceeds them . Risk taking separates the men from the boys . JAMES T. ARBUCKLE Brookfield , Conn . <P> Your report included the views of a gay man who was a proponent of barebacking ( having unprotected sex with multiple partners ) . For him , the rush of such sex outweighs the risk of becoming HIV positive  --  especially because AIDS , in his eyes , is turning from a fatal disease into a chronic illness . Lucky for this guy that he is not in South Africa , where there are scant funds to treat HIV patients or pay for anti-AIDS drugs . Here his risk taking would leave him dead . Not every country is able to spend millions of dollars for AIDS drugs so that a generation of spoiled kids can play games with death . LAURA MARCUS Nylstroom , South Africa <P> Although engaging in endeavors of risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences ( especially of risky sexual behavior ) affect the lives of not only the risk takers but also the families , partners and friends . An underlying sense of selfishness and greed pervades many forms of risk that know no limits . CHARLES LAUTH New York City <P> It is somewhat unsettling to see that thrill seeking to the point of looking death in the eye is replacing more valuable pursuits  --  responsibility for others , respect , tolerance and religion . WERNER RADTKE Paderborn , Germany <P> Lewis and Clark , Einstein , Galileo , Edison and test pilots are risk takers , as are BASE jumpers and other devotees of extreme sports . But there is a crucial difference . Society gets no benefit from the latter group , who are solely concerned with selfish gratification . GILBERT STORK Englewood , N.J. <P> People who indulge in extreme sports are nuts . I played football and then rugby for years . It was n't the risk that enthralled me . It was that sense of belonging , of being part of a team . Prove how tough I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETER HILLYER North Topsail Beach , N.C.
