I 'D TURNED FORTY and it was weighing pretty heavy on me . I was in a bar again , as usual , and I was thinking about my daddy again , as usual , and what all he had gone through , and wishing he was sitting on the bar stool next to me , when in reality he was dead and gone and asleep with the worms since April 19th , 1968 , and I had just ordered a Crown and Coke that had just arrived and I was looking at the large breasts of a red-haired girl who was sitting next to me and I realized that I was slightly drunk and did n't really give a damn what happened next . The world had turned around on me and I had been published and all the years I had struggled through were a forgotten memory that sometimes rose up in my head and reminded me . <p> The price had been high and now I was being constantly assaulted by young writers who offered things if I would read their stories . They offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hotel rooms in New Orleans , and blowjobs . I did n't want to have anything to do with them . I knew that their stories would break my heart not because they were so good but because they were so bad and I would have to be the one to tell them they ought to probably cut their throats instead of trying to be fiction writers but I knew they would n't listen to me . <p> I saw a well-dressed man start trying to make love to a girl with really snaggly teeth , I mean her teeth were rotted and crooked , she had some kind of bad gum disease , she was loose , a loose woman , a woman who wore loose dirty T-shirts and was fat in that way that you knew when you looked at her that she could never be any way other than the way she was , no matter how much dieting she did , no matter how much she exercised , that she would always hang out in bars drunk , the last one to be pulled off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't give her two glances when they were sober , and this man , this well-dressed man , he made it a point to come up to her and remark that he 'd been meaning to talk to her , that he 'd meant to talk to her the other night , and that if she had a few minutes he 'd like to talk to her right away . She grinned , that awful black-toothed grin , and said she had plenty of time , and they went off into a corner after he bought her a drink . <p> She 'd been running with a little road-lizard who could n't pay his bar tab and had been cut off for it . Her teeth were awful , something you 'd see in a nightmare , something you 'd never want to kiss . I thought it was plain to everybody in the bar that the man was wanting to have sexual intercourse with her . It was plain to me . I would n't have even bought her a beer . I 'd have moved if she sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her at all . She seemed to be expecting to hear the good things the man was saying to her . I did n't watch where they went . I knew that the bushes were dark at night and that there were secret things that went on that nobody but the participants saw . <p> There were a lot of drunk people in there . It felt pretty homey , what with all the friendly smiles and the people who knew each other talking to each other , and some people were dancing out on the dance floor although I was n't . My dog had died , had been killed , actually , by another dog , and it had taken all my self-control to keep from slipping a round into the magazine of my 30.30 and slowly , lovingly , squeezing off one sweet bullet into the head of the dog that had killed him . He 'd come up and pissed on one of my fenceposts the day before , and I 'd gone as far as to load up the rifle and lay it on the hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on up and piss on my rosebush in the yard . I even sighted on him . I even fixed the cross hairs on his burry head and said to myself , You 're a lucky son of a bitch that I 'm such a nice guy even though you 're not . <p> I hung around on my stool for a while . I 'd paid my income tax and I had hardly any money to drink on at all . I wanted some love myself and knew I was too shoddy-looking to get any . I tried to dance with a few women but nobody wanted to dance with me and I could n't blame them . I was looking pretty disreputable . I 'd had to tape up the toe of one of my boots and my fingernails had a lot of black greasy dirt under them from changing out a water pump on my truck . Doing that had made me thirsty , and since it was my birthday , I had come back to this dark hole-in-the-wall looking for love . <p> I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talking . I did n't really understand the whole thing . The only thing I had figured out was that men came into bars hoping to pick up women , and drank , and then the women came in a little later , all dressed up and smelling good and wearing tight pants and low-cut blouses that exposed the tops of their breasts , and it drove the men crazy who were wanting them , and the lucky ones , the ones with money and nice haircuts and good shoe-shines got the women , and the rest of them had to fight because they could n't fuck . I had figured out that that was it : if they could n't fuck they had to fight , and fight they did . A small marathon of face-punching erupted suddenly two bar stools down from me , two guys knocking each other 's heads back and forth with frothy bloody lips and teeth flying . The bartender clouted one of them on the head and the guy left like a good boy , no questions asked . I ordered another drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to last until closing time and it saddened me immeasurably . <p> I had been introduced to some women a little earlier by a friend of mine who had tried to buy them a drink , but it quickly became evident that they were much more interested in each other . I 'm not saying that they were tongue-kissing or anything , but it was pretty obvious to me that before the night was over all of them were going to have a mouthful of pubic hair . It was all they could do to keep their hands off each other and I had a sinking spell when I found out that they were all very glad to meet me . I did n't want to have anything to do with them and when one of them asked me to buy her a drink , I did n't . I could tell by looking at her that she 'd been in a mental institution and she seemed to be still a little nutty . I 'd talked to a dentist who 'd worked in a mental institution for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd heard voices inside their mouths and had taken Black &; Decker drills to their molars . I did n't want to get acquainted with a bunch of people like that . I had troubles enough of my own . I had turned forty . All I wanted to do was sit there and drink my whiskey and then drink another one . I was n't asking a whole lot out of life that particular night , just to see forty-one . <p> The well-dressed guy came back to the bar and ordered two more drinks and I looked over his shoulder at the awful woman who was looking in his direction as if she knew something that nobody else did . Her teeth were beyond funky . If she 'd been my dog I 'd have shot her . I could n't help wondering if she 'd let her mouth get in that kind of shape what kind of shape she 'd let her vagina get in . And here this guy was wanting to ream the depths of it . He tipped the bartender big , two dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went back with the drinks and the horrible woman laughed at something he said . My drink came and I counted out my change and paid . The bartender looked at me as if I was a small partially-dissolved turd . <p> The television was playing but it was silent . I looked at Senta Berger 's magnificent breasts in Major Dundee while she and Charlton Heston were wallowing in a river . They were like mountains , like unchained melodies , like lewd sculptures from a deranged Michelangelo . I could hear the horrid woman laughing at everything the well-dressed man was saying . I glanced over and saw that they were holding hands . I considered starting a bar tab and then writing a bad check to cover it , but there was a large sign over the cash register that said NO CHECKS . I had ten dollars and change left to my name . I knew there was no whiskey at home , only a couple of cans of sardines and a few of cat food , and I was n't down to eating that yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler 's heart . My daddy almost knew Hitler . He went to his house with his gun but the motherfucker was n't home . <p> I felt that my daddy had been kind of like Jesus in that he 'd suffered for our sins . Not our sins , maybe , just maybe our freedom . Him and about three million other guys . He had n't been eaten by the sharks at Guadalcanal , or burned alive on the Coral Sea , but he 'd had cold feet in Germany and had killed soldiers of the enemy forces and recovered pictures of their children . All that had n't made him a happy man . He had shot a man one day and had that man 's kid come up looking for his father the next day . He knew because he 'd seen the picture of the kid in the man 's hand the day before . He 'd given the kid a piece of chocolate , and had n't told him that his father was buried in a mass grave along with about two hundred other dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dogs . I think that most days they thought no more of them than dogs . By the time my father got to Auschwitz he was pretty pissed at the German race in particular . And I think that later in life he regretted all his anger , but what was he supposed to do about it then ? <p> This girl , this lunatic lesbian , she leaned over and asked me if I was Leon Barlow . I admitted that I was . I kept hoping that a friend would come in , somebody I knew , somebody who might buy me a drink . I watched the door for a while but only strangers came in . I drank slowly and watched the movie . Charlton had Warren Oates shot for a deserter and then went off to chase some more Indians . Senta Berger 's tits kept swaying magnificently in the background and it nearly drove me crazy . I wanted to rut with somebody like an animal , like a fuck-machine with a microchip for a brain . I was horny and I knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could drink free all night . I knew that the terrible woman with the bad teeth was locked into a big spender who only wanted a little of her puss . I knew she 'd give it gladly . <p> This girl next to me said : " So you 're Leon Barlow , huh ? " <p> I said : " Yeah , goddamnit , I 'm him . " <p> She said : " You want to buy me a pack of cigarettes ? I ai n't going to screw you . " <p> I said : " Darlin ' , I do n't want you to screw me . Buy your own damn pack of cigarettes . " <p> And I turned back to my whiskey . I knew she was deranged . She had all the accoutrements of the mentally deranged : loose hair , wild shoes , paisley pants . Plus one of her buddies with very large hooters had been crotch-grabbing her . I mean you could tell that later they were going to get down . I did n't feel like I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy her some smokes . <p> It started raining outside and it only deepened my mood of misery and despair . I 'd been down in Mexico a few weeks earlier hunting artifacts and native art and I 'd been held up by mountain bandits and they 'd lifted fifteen hundred American dollars off me and cut a small American flag into my stomach with a sharply pointed knife . They had laughed at me while I 'd lain there bleeding , and a small boy had come up to me after they left with a wet piece of wool and bathed my wound . He had black eyes and black hair and was wearing blue shorts without underwear . His name was Pancho . He put me on a small donkey and led me to his home , and his mother had fixed me tortillas and coffee and had spread her fat thighs over me after the child had gone to sleep and whispered into my ear that she loved me and wanted to come to America . I 'd gotten on a pack mule the next morning and ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket home with the last of my American Express traveler 's checks . <p> I suddenly wanted to be back in that woman 's hut with the sun falling behind the mountains , drinking mescal , eyeing her heavy breasts inside her threadbare shirt , waiting for Pancho to go to sleep . I could have stayed there and married them and loved them and not been in the shape I was in . She had admitted that her brother was one of the men who had robbed me , and that if nothing happened to prevent it , Pancho would grow into a life of crime . <p> All of that was weighing on me pretty heavy while I sat and listened to the artificial laughter coming out of the booth behind me . <p> I turned around and looked again . They were smoking cigarettes and playing with each other 's fingers . I knew he was suggesting things and I could see that she was ready to listen . The little road-lizard she had been running with walked back into the bar and took one look at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He knew it was n't his day . <p> This chick next to me said : " You want me to read some of my poetry to you ? " <p> I said : " Nah , I do n't guess so . " <p> So she said : " So , you 're , like , Leon Barlow . Like , that 's some big deal ? " <p> I said : " It ai n't no big deal to me . " <p> She said : " My poetry 's pretty goddamn good . " <p> I said : " Good . Go blow your smoke up somebody else 's ass . " <p> She said : " Do you read stuff for people ? " <p> I said : " I used to . I quit doing it because it got out of hand . Everybody 's got the dream and the dream do n't come true that often . I worked my ass off for a million years and all it got me is having to sit here and listen to somebody like you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was starting to bother me . She had her legs spread out and her big-tittied buddy was rubbing her crotch with her elbow and leering . <p> I said : " Damn . Why do n't y'all go off somewhere in private ? " <p> She said : " But what 's the secret , Leon ? Come on , what 's the secret ? " <p> I said : " There ai n't no secret . You live your life like you want to . If you want to hurt bad enough for something you can have it . That 's all there is to it . Whether you write or not is up to you . I 'm drinking . Now leave me alone . " <p> I turned away from her and the band started . I got off my bar stool and stood around for a while . I decided that I would take what little money I had left and go down to the liquor store before it closed and buy a bottle and get as drunk as I could on what money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit in seven months , and I 'd worked night and day , like a maniac , filling trash cans full of sheets of paper full of words that said nothing , pure crap , not good enough to wipe my dead dog 's ass with . <p> I walked out and got in my truck and went down the street . A cop car got in behind me and followed me for a while . They had the bad habit of hanging around my favorite bar like vultures , waiting to pick off some unlucky person who 'd had one too many , who made the wrong step , who moved in an abnormal way on the way to his vehicle . I had learned to look both ways before crossing the street , like a Boy Scout . They saw that I was n't weaving and they left me alone . <p> I stepped into the liquor store at two minutes before closing time . The guy eyed the clock and then sold me what I wanted , a cold bottle of Orange Driver , $2.95 a fifth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night was over , but I needed it for the food value . I knew it was loaded with Vitamin C. <p> The only good thing was that I had plenty of gas and a radio . I drove out of town , popped the top on the Driver , and started singing along with the radio . I rode through Taylor , through Tula , through Toccopola . I thought about all the decent people who were home asleep in their beds . I thought about all the lives and all the stories that were there , wonderful things , horrible things , heartbreaking things . I knew that I 'd lost it and I was afraid I 'd never get it back . At one time the muse would come and sit and shit on my shoulder like a pigeon and I had taken it for granted . I had thought it would always be there . Now I was just a cheap drunk , an ex-hack wearing Salvation Army shoes . I started hitting the Driver pretty hard . I smoked one cigarette after another . I ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't smell anything else . The Driver even started tasting like it . I started getting a little sick at my stomach . I stopped on the side of the road and threw up . I remembered a story a nurse had told me one time , about a black guy being brought into the emergency room where she worked , with a gunshot wound in the stomach . He was screaming and puking and slinging blood everywhere , and she was trying to hold him down on a table , and he leaned his head over and puked up a big chunk of sardine right in her pocket , a chunk she said was two inches long . I puked a little more . <p> I wiped my mouth and staggered back into my truck , with my eyes weepy and the bile rising in my throat . I rolled the windows down and hung my head out the window like a dog while I drove , gasping in great big gulps of the night air . The smell of the polecat faded a little and I was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . I began to feel a little better . I thought I could make it back to town . <p> It was late when I got back up there . I drove around the square several times thinking about everything . I was pretty drunk . I saw a bunch of kids out there , standing around , yelling at people going by , talking trash to chicks , yahooing and being young . And I thought : You boys just do n't know . Never again will you have this time in your lives of carefree jubilation and you will only get your first piece once . Make it good . Run wild . Climb a mountain . Join a yacht club . Water-ski . Drink plenty of beer . Learn to play a musical instrument . <p> I stopped driving around the square but parked near it and walked back down the alley to my home away from home . The place was nearly deserted . Two drunks , on two stools , and the bartender was the only one who did n't have his head on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked the bartender where everybody had gone to and he said a big party out in the county at a private lake and lakehouse . Some high roller had come in and invited the whole place out to his place , all drinks furnished , barbecue and hamburgers , swimming pool . The bartender was positive that everybody out there , most of them women , would get naked and lay in a pile . <p> I sat there . The bartender picked up a paperback Tom Clancy and took a powder . One of the drunks was on his way to the floor if nobody helped him pretty quick . Nobody helped him . He crashed over and laid on the floor , trying to go to sleep . It made me realize that there was a whole lot to be said for staying at home . <p> I kept sitting there , drinking , smoking a cigarette , looking at the guy on the floor . He might have been somebody 's daddy . I felt pretty bad about everything . I got into these funks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a deer or running off into a ditch . Once in a while I 'd tie a rope around my neck and go lie down in the river and let the fish nibble on me . I 'd lie there in that cold muddy current with those slick muddy banks all above me and think about Daddy slogging through the mud of Europe , snipers crouching in hollowed-out transformers shooting fire down on him while he talked on the radio and reported their positions , rows of telephone poles jumping off their stumps when they blew them all in line with det cord , the big deer he killed in Germany and the cold and awful snow . How we fished when I was a child . I wanted him back and I never got over missing him and I never told any of my friends how lucky they were that their fathers were still around . I never said , Be glad , buddy , you still got him . <p> I ordered another drink and poured it straight down my throat . That was the last of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light rain was falling . It fell on my cap and my camouflage jacket . I held no animosity toward the lesbians . They were only having fun with one another . I went on up the street , looking for nothing in particular . Later that night I would knock a boy one hundred feet into a river , but at that moment , as I was remembering little Pancho and thinking of my daddy , and of how I was now in bars like he used to be when I was small and confused and did n't know where he was or why he would n't come home , I felt him there , deep inside my forty-year-old heart , and I knew that I was made of the same stuff as him . <p> The girl with the bad teeth staggered up out of the bushes , her clothes in disarray , and we smiled at each other . The rest is too bad to tell . <p> <p> By LARRY BROWN <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
