<p> The books seem quite different from one another . One 's a romantic comedy , another 's a mystery , the third is n't even fiction  --  it 's a travel book , sorta . But the trio have two things in common : one , their milieu is the glamorous , high-end restaurant business , and two , none of them is so weighty , literally or figuratively , as to slip through hands coated with Coppertone . <p> Starting with the home team , Washington Post restaurant critic Phyllis Richman has written a dishy murder mystery whose plucky protagonist is a former chef turned . . . newspaper restaurant critic . The body of superstar Washington chef Laurence Levain falls dead in the first four pages of " The Butter Did It " ( HarperCollins , $ 23 ) , which leaves some 300 pages in which the writer and reader can march through the emotionally untidy world of restaurants . <p> The initial thinking is that the butter did indeed do it , given the sexy paraphernalia left at the scene and Levain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheatley has her doubts , based on her intimate knowledge of Levain from their early days in Paris , when ( it gets complicated here ) they had an affair while she and her French-chef husband were growing apart but before the husband left her for another man . Eventually all the book 's characters joined " the American restaurant renaissance , the headquarters of which was generally identified as the nation 's capital . " <p> Okay , so this is fiction . But it 's peopled with the real , somewhat bloated egos of the cooking and newspapering worlds , and accessorized with identifiable quotes and traits that could be footnoted in an annotated edition published for roman a clef junkies . ( Do n't you want to know which newspaper editor rebuffed Wheatley 's idea of doing a story by going to a weight-loss spa , pointing out that he was still at his college weight ? And which one insisted Nicoise was pronounced nick-OYS ? ) <p> So as the plot thickens ( stirred constantly ) the details all ring true : reporters sitting around playing Solitaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Wheatley , the **31;1235;TOOLONG , mini-lectures on baking bread and on what less-than-fresh clams taste like . We learn about chefs with " blueberry-syrup eyes " and those whose faces turn " the color of bechamel " under stress ( the ingredients are at times a bit overbaked : When they first met , we learn , Wheatley 's husband " was a baked potato and I was the butter , sour cream , and chives  --  ready to melt into him . " Check , please ! ) . <p> All in all , it 's a lively romp . And when 's the last time you heard a fictional character proudly proclaim that he 'd been a high school exchange student in Bowie , Md. ? <p> The restaurant world has been used as a backdrop to murder before . And the power of food itself has enriched books from Nora Ephron 's " Heartburn " ( 1983 ) to Laura Esquivel 's " Like Water for Chocolate " ( 1992 ) . Now , though , commercial kitchens seem so sexy that the embroidered story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the case with Karen Hubert Allison 's " How I Gave My Heart to the Restaurant Business " ( Ecco Press , $ 23 ) . Back on the cusp of the 1980s , Allison and her husband owned the well-regarded Huberts in Manhattan , an experience that provided the author with material for her highly competitive food-world characters . <p> Allison 's romantic lead , Kitterina Kittridge , loves to cook but feels forced to paint ( by her art-collector mother ) until along comes Gunnar , a Russian-Scandinavian bundle of **34;1268;TOOLONG . Things move fast . One minute Kittridge is selling sandwiches at street fairs , the next minute Gunnar has created a little dinner club for her , and then a Manhattan hot spot . Before she knows it , her dream of a little sandwich shop has spun out of control , and instead of cooking she 's hiring chefs , and managers , and public relations consultants . Which all seems fine until the sex starts to run dry . <p> The romance and the restaurant are equal partners in the plot . Food critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel the message of how stressful the restaurant biz can feel from the inside . A former waiter 's Labor Department lawsuit ; big-mouthed Mr. B , who negotiates endlessly about buying into the business but does n't ; Kittridge 's transformation from a " culinary madonna " to a " culinary whore "  --  that 's the real message of the novel . <p> And if all that sounds far from food and quiet cooking , well , the heroine agrees . Her eventual disenchantment triggers the end of the story  --  and the author blurb notes that Allison and her husband now live on Maui . <p> Telling a tale with a plot is one thing . Now imagine that a friend of yours spends a few weeks traveling through Europe eating at Michelin three-star restaurants . A lot of them . And now he or she is back , eager to recount every mouthful to poor deprived you . Under most circumstances , I 'd rather sign up for surgery than listen , which I confide only to indicate how entertaining " Feeding Frenzy " ( Grove/Atlantic Monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frenzy , " whose official publication date is June 17 , starts with author Stuart Stevens 's " appallingly shallow sort of New York nineties-style friendship " with ex-fashion model and weightlifting partner Rachel " Rat " Kelly . Eating in restaurants and working out together are all Stevens and Kelly seem to do with each other ( she already has a lawyer boyfriend ) . So it 's not that far-fetched when Kelly proposes that the two of them head for Europe and eat  --  " a lot . " And , she eventually adds , if maybe they take on all the three-stars on consecutive nights , her boyfriend will probably pay for it all . <p> They set off first to tackle England 's two three-stars , the Waterside Inn , about 40 miles north of London , and La Tante Claire . Then the three-stars in Belgium , Germany , France , Italy . There are only 29 such places , Kelly points out . Only . <p> In addition to being a political consultant ( the Stuart Stevens Group made commercials for Bob Dole 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Exposure , " " I 'll Fly Away " ) , Stevens is also a travel writer of some accomplishment , so he knows how to fuel a narrative to keep a caper moving . " Rat " and a 1965 red Mustang convertible without brakes are both vehicles here , and both enliven what could have been a solemn debauch ( in fact , the author now says he worries that serious foodies may frown on his spirited treatment of the eighth sacrament , the degustation ) . <p> As the pair work up speed , restaurants and meals fly by . So do terrific lines : " Eating at a new , highly recommended restaurant is like a Very Important Blind Date . . . . Somewhere in the back of your head is the dour warning that disappointment is inevitable , but you do n't really believe it or you would n't be there . The best eaters are always optimists . " <p> The author 's drive-by dining allows for overviews of the European haute cuisine scene that individual restaurant reviews do n't provide . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to graduate from two Michelin stars to three ( sales can jump 30 percent as a result ) . And examples of humble country kitchens that have transmuted into miniature Versailles and resorts with helicopter pads ( " Most of the renovations had a fun-house , amusement-park quality mixed with a heavy dose of Arab brothel " ) . And signs of the celebrityhood that has overtaken great chefs in the last 20 years ( at Bocuse , outside Lyons , flashbulbs went off every few minutes " as the crowd scrambled to document their presence at Bocuse " ) . <p> Michel Guerard , Taillevent , Lucas Carton , Comme Chez Soi , Troisgros , Alain Ducasse . The meals and miles fly by  --  into Belgium , a dip into Italy , through the heart of France , " the freshly cut hayfields dotted with impossibly neat rolls of hay " and the telephone poles placarded with 3615 SEX . <p> I could go on . Rat and Stevens doubtless did . But they got to eat along the way , and I 'm getting hungry .
