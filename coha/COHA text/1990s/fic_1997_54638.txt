Donnelly 's hand rose high , hoisting the Bible like a trophy . Her forehead furrowed , and her voice rose with practiced inflection that echoed among the rafters and stained-glass windows . Her rhythms and cadences crested and rolled in waves , well rehearsed after years of roadside revivals in forgotten Southern towns . Thank you , Lord , for making me your instrument for one more day . <p> " Men of Earth are cavorting with creatures who never read the Gospel  --  " <p> She cast her gaze across her beloved flock . <p> " Who never heard the Word of God  --  " <p> They must hear her words if they were to be saved . <p> " Who never felt the guiding hand of our Savior  --  " <p> She was their lamp in the darkness brought from the stars , ever since those first faint signals were heard by the Farside Lunar Receiver . And those first vessels descended from the clouds . <p> " Who have no souls , for the Kingdom of Heaven was prepared by Jesus for Man alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she gazed down upon her congregation . A subconscious clock measured the dramatic pause , then her voice modulated to a preordained pitch . " We walk not with angels , but with aliens blind to Man 's true gift to God 's firmament  --  our Savior Jesus Christ ! " She thrust the Bible before her like a shield . " Jesus said ... " She paused to catch the eyes of those before her ; it was an easy haul . " Jesus said , ' No one can enter the Kingdom of Heaven but by me ' ! " She clenched her eyes shut and listened . <p> There had been a time , years ago , when the stained glass would have rattled with " Amen ! " and " Hallelujah ! " ringing throughout the sanctuary . And on Easter and Christmas Sundays ( when extra fold-out chairs were brought in from the Fellowship Hall ) the room had been so filled with upraised voices that the walls might have burst open and flooded the world with the Lord 's holy praises . <p> Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far away bells in the courthouse clock chimed the hour . Old Ralph Hardin in the rear pews needed a Kleenex . No more than twenty souls here today . Fewer than last week . <p> She opened her eyes , lowered the Bible to the pulpit . Her brow lost its furrows , but not the thin lines like dried-up river beds . Her voice was almost inaudible over the heating system . <p> " Do n't forget next Sunday 's Christmas Eve candle-lighting service . Bring your friends . " She despised the dead weight of defeat in her voice . " That 's all . " There was no organist to play the benediction and postlude . <p> She turned away , loosened her collar , and rubbed her eyes , keeping them closed longer than she really needed to . The sounds of shuffling coats and snuffling noses rose behind her . The exit door in the rear foyer groaned on its arthritic joints , and December 's gray chill slid down out of the Ozarks and brushed the back of her neck . Winter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of Harper , Missouri . <p> She turned back to her pulpit to gather up the sermon . Gerald Morris was peering up from the floor below . The chicken farmer clutched his overcoat against his belly and stared at her with eyes that rarely blinked , two eggs pressed into a moist dough face . <p> " Revern ' Donnelly ? " His voice , like his brown suit jacket , was thin and faded . <p> " Yes , Gerald , what can I do for you ? " <p> " M'mama wants to know when you 're comin ' out to the nursin ' home agin . She says your services alwiz brighten her day . She says so alia time . She 's real sick , and the doctors , they do n't know how long " His voice thinned away to nothing . <p> She exhaled , then smiled .

" Jimmy Don Ledbetter says he saw two of them Seekers in St. Louis last week . He says they talked with just ever'body about how glad they was Earth was joining the Union . Then one of them helped Roy Capehart  --  you know , the taxidermist ?  --  fly through the air . Without wings or nothin ' ! It was its Gift , it said . Then another'n made colors in the air and music came from the pictures they made . Said we could maybe do it someday . Ever'one had just the best time ! Is n't that wonderful ?

" Jimmy Don Ledbetter says  --  " <p> Donnelly shut her eyes . " Gerald . There are new temptations out there among the stars . The Seekers know neither Christ nor salvation , even though all you need is the faith of a mustard seed . " She replayed an old memory : a sanctuary filled with multitudes in her spiritual hug . She had been a pilgrim , a searcher for God 's wisdom , sharing what she found with others . She had been young and strong of voice . And of spirit . <p> The memory faded , leaving only the floaters drifting across the insides of her eyelids . " Only God knows what is in their hearts , " she said quietly . She opened her eyes .

Twelve years now after First Contact , dozens of assorted aliens  --  " extrasolar emissaries "  --  were on Earth , mostly in big cities like New York and Moscow , London and Tokyo , Beijing and Bombay . Their immense ships had followed their transmissions , offering humanity membership in a galactic trade Union that was opening new markets in the outer galactic reaches . The world was still knocked cock-eyed by it all . The cultural elite were declaring it the greatest event in human history . A new age on Earth . Peace and prosperity . Heaven on Earth . <p> But no heavenly trumpet had sounded . Just those first signals from out of Sagittarius , heard only by electronic ears . No salvation had come , for it arrived not on angelic wings and a fiery throne , but in huge vessels orbiting Earth and landers descending from the clouds , even in non-Christian lands . And more were arriving all the time . <p> She felt betrayed , but she was n't sure by whom . She only knew that the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Christmas ! Hallmark 's biggest sellers were miniature spaceships hanging from Christmas trees across the land  --  " collect the whole set ! " Earth would never again know a cosmos in which Man was adrift and alone . The fruit from the Tree of Knowledge had tasted sweet . <p> Donnelly turned her back again , stuffing the morning 's text into a dog-cared file folder . This was the third go-round for this sermon . And the last . <p> The rear door complained and a cold breeze scraped across the back of Donnelly 's neck . She sighed , but did not turn around . " Be right with you , " she called . She listened for footsteps on the floorboards . Instead , she heard glass tinkling the sound a crystal chandelier makes when given a gentle swing . She turned . The room was empty . <p> " Who 's there ? Come out ! " The tinkling stopped abruptly , as if someone muffled all the crystal droplets at once . <p> At the far end of the aisle , a knobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five faceted fingers grew at its tip and waved . To the tinkling of tiny bells , a spun-glass sculpture walked into the aisle . <p> Donnelly 's brain struggled to find analogies . A leafless bush in winter , crafted by a glassblower . Branches and twigs of fine crystal were shot through with blues and reds and golds flowing through icy veins . They reached up from a nest of dew-dipped spider webs where indefinable hues came and went , blending , shifting , sparkling in the sunlight slanting through the colored windows . <p> Donnelly stared across the room at the ... the thing . A sour taste crawled up onto her tongue . <p> " I must ask you to leave , " she said , struggling to keep the surprise and disgust out of her voice . " Keep your Satan-sent ways out of God 's house . " <p> The creature quivered . Two translucent twigs reached down into the glittering webs . They reappeared and held aloft a meaty ovoid sac . The bladder wriggled wetly , split open across the middle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pardon me , please , " it said in a dead-on Missouri accent . " I wish to talk with God . " The fragile-looking thing scuttled up the aisle on glassy insect legs , bringing the sound of windchimes in the rain . <p> Standing there with it approaching her , Donnelly felt a familiar bitterness burn in her chest . <p> The creature reached the steps at the base of the pulpit . Diamond glints danced across its surfaces . It raised the sac toward Donnelly 's face . The Talker symbiote 's humanform lips smacked open , flashing straight white teeth . " Please , " the translator said . " Teach me to talk with God . " <p> Donnelly wanted to spit . " God listens to our prayers . Can you pray ? " She put as much venom into her voice as a good Christian could muster . <p> " I have practiced the prayer rituals of six hundred forty-four worlds , " said the translator . As it spoke , lights like golden fireflies chased through its master 's branches . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know of God ? " <p> " I have worshipped the deities of many cultures , often at the cost of emotional or physical pain . Occasionally , enlightenment was gained . But none offered what I desired . " <p> " Why come to me ? " <p> " I enjoy the quiet places of your world . Trees . I enjoy trees . I was strolling nearby and recognized the religious symbol at the summit of this building . I meditated , then chose to seek out the religious leader here . That , I perceive , is you . Your species has developed religious expression with great complexity and ritual . Humans have many god-forms . Perhaps one has the answer I seek . Perhaps you do . " <p> The thing tweaked Donnelly 's curiosity . The Talker 's perfect human voice softened its master 's alien appearance . " What do you seek ? " she asked . <p> The alien sparkled and its Talker took in a gulp of air . " I am old for my kind . And an aberration . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " the translator 's lips curled upward in a wry smile , "  --  home-bodies . I , however , enjoy the company of other species and have lived for centuries in many cultures on many worlds . I have experienced ... marvels that can not be spoken of in your language , which has neither words nor concepts to describe them . " <p> The Talker frowned for its master . " I have reached the limits of life-prolongation techniques useful to my species , and now approach the end of my biological processes . Once I believed that I had experienced the known universe to its fullest . But the long journey to this galactic arm revealed many more ... wonders beyond my experience . Oh , if only I could share them with you ! But your language can not convey  --  " Flecks of light whirled , changing their hue . " You have no  --  " The translator 's rubbery features mimicked human frustration well . " And still there are uncountable galaxies beyond this one . I fear that I will not live to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It stood silent for slow seconds , then climbed the three steps to Donnelly 's side . Crystalline arms lifted the Talker closer . Its voice was edged with hope and desperation . " I wish to never die . " <p> Donnelly studied the tiny fires and woven geometries of the alien . This creature hoped for the salvation promised by the Son of Man . Could it even have an immortal soul ? Would God create mind without soul ? These beings sailed the stars long before Eve sealed Adam 's fate . What sins did they know , and were now bringing to Earth ? <p> Donnelly remembered the hot smells of musty tent cloth and road dust , of sweating sinners who wept at her feet and begged for salvation . She had saved souls by the dozens at each town and farm . Now , perhaps , a greater flock was being offered . <p> With proper guidance , this reborn creature and its gifted symbiote could preach the Word in churches , in cathedrals throughout the world . Millions would travel far to hear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . Imagine the Good News spreading throughout the heavens ! A million worlds cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ . With this disciple at her side , Reverend Ardith Donnelly could take up the sword and see to it that Christ died for the sins of a galaxy . <p> This must be her true calling , the reason God guided the Seekers ' ships out of the darkness to Earth , where the light of Christianity could dim a million suns . The Lord led this poor emissary to Donnelly 's pulpit , to the one true faith , to the feet of Christ 's own lighthouse . If Donnelly 's Earthly flock chose to stray from the path of righteousness , well then she and the Lord would carve a new path that spread for light-years in all directions . Thank you , God . Thank you , dear Jesus . <p> She smiled down at the alien . Her voice was robed in maternal patience . <p> " Eternal life is offered only to believers in Christ . " She opened the Book of Matthew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She felt as though her skull had vanished and warm water flowed over her brain  --  <p>  --  She is a tremendous crystal bathing in cold acid pools beneath the spectrum-flecked radiance of a star cluster . She sees without eyes and feels without flesh , and she sings without sound in perfect harmony with ten billion others like herself on a hundred worlds . She sings of birth , of hunger and mystery , and of the deepest yearning she has ever known ... <p>  --  She leaps , joyously laughing , from a cliff of black glass into an ocean lit by a bloated red giant sun . The hot sea engulfs her , and the Joy rushes like fire across her front fins , down her long spine , and into her hindbrain . Broadcasting exaltation to all who listen , she plunges deeper into the First Mother Who Gave Us Life ... <p>  --  Buoyant , balloonish , she floats high above eternal storms that stir the Depths below .

It is time to drift higher , toward the tiny glows that are so far away where the Sky grows dark ... <p> NO ! I AM NOT THIS ! I AM  --  <p>  --  happy to be needed here inside my God . We help each other , or we die together . I feel my God 's thoughts . There is a minor infection in a main ventricle wall . I swim there , against a pulsing tide , knowing what to do . There can be no greater purpose ... <p>  --  gliding above a new world , beneath a billion suns in the galaxy 's bulging belly . Hard radiations are warm and tingly on my sails . Life is there , its unique power irresistible .

The air is cold . <p> Donnelly found herself on the carpet in a fetal position , shouting nonsense syllables . She felt as though a cord had been cut , a connection severed , her brain detached from an infinite communion . She was adrift . Alone . <p> She sat up . Her skin felt like someone else 's ill-fitting clothes . Every movement was wrong in ways she could not describe . She was sore in her arms and legs . And in limbs she never had . <p> Somewhere nearby , a chandelier jingled in a breeze . She turned . The Talker was frowning down at her . Below it , crystal webs glimmered kaleidoscopically . The Talker wriggled . " Many apologies ! I did not wish to cause discomfort . Please forgive . I thought you wanted to share . The experiences are impossible to express fully in your language .

" The Gift of my species is a specialized telempathy . We , I , collect the life experiences of non-self species . We share these with other non-self minds . This way all life knows what it is like to be all others . A prized Gift in a Union of many worlds , yes ? I wished you to understand my problem . " <p> Donnelly , or the part of her that was still merely Donnelly , understood . She had sung of mysteries in a cold acid pool . She feared the angry Winds in the clouds of an immense Jovian world . She had told untellable tales brought home from far stars . Wave after wave washed over a flickering flame of belief in ... what ? Created in God 's image ? How could we have gotten it so wrong ? But in each experience , one truth was common . Life was precious . And too short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help me . I have shared your mind .

Yet you have no evidence to support it . <p> " Also  --  " The Talker frowned as if it were tasting something sour . " Your species has thought itself alone in the cosmos . This I have never experienced . It was not a pleasant sharing . I will carry the memory with me and share you with other non-self forms . In this way you  --  " It poked a glassy finger against Donnelly 's chest . Fireflies flew within its wintery branches . "  --  may be immortal , in a way , according to your belief system . " <p> The alien lowered its Talker back into its body . The meaty mouth spoke through a nest of ice . " I regret that I may not live long enough to find my answers .

The rear door keened on its hinges . <p> A chill breeze ran along the carpet and curled around Donnelly . She tried to sing a song born beneath a heaven far richer than the barren skies of Earth . She yearned for something wonderful she could not name . Her skin remembered the hot embrace of a red sea and the electric prickle of a stellar wind . The insides of her eyelids , she knew , would never again show merely darkness . <p> All it takes is the faith of a mustard seed , she had told her flock . Lifetimes ago . But a mustard seed tossed into an infinite orchard ... <p> Silently , Donnelly offered up a prayer . <p> After a long while , she stood , massaged stiff muscles , and slowly walked down the aisle to the door . It moaned a last lingering lament as she opened it . <p> There were glints of light in the graveyard across the road . The Seeker was there , studying the ornate headstones .
