What made me a success in business would make me a failure as a politician . <P>  --  Ross Perot to the Washington Post , 1969 <P> Some failure . Without even formally declaring his candidacy , Perot has unleashed a hurricane of discontent with politics  --  and politicians  --  as usual , sweeping up millions of citizens in an emotional crusade that could conceivably propel him all the way to the White House . Despite what may be a temporary leveling off in his popularity , the Texan still outpaces George Bush in the polls and leaves Democrat Bill Clinton in the dust . No other independent candidate in modern American history has mounted a more serious challenge to the two-party Establishment . <P> Paradoxically , Perot 's spectacular rise has been fueled by his image as an anti-politician , even though he has shown an intuitive mastery of political skills . While some experts  --  and his rivals  --  contend that a man who lacks years of hands-on government experience stands no chance of cutting through the gridlock in Washington , Perot 's supporters have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other candidates debate proposals for coping with the deficit and various complex issues . Perot vows that he can solve problems that have baffled other politicians " without breaking a sweat , " often adding , as a precaution , that the steps he takes " wo n't be pretty . " <P> Until recently , Perot 's can-do attitude alone has been enough to satisfy the fired-up volunteers who have already collected enough signatures to place him on the ballot in at least 16 states . He has been vague , to say the least , in specifying how he would go about setting things right in Washington . Perot says he needs time to bone up on the issues with a newly assembled team of experts . <P> Meanwhile a natural law of American politics is beginning to take effect : once a candidate is anointed as front runner , he inevitably triggers enough intense scrutiny from the press , opponents and voters to slow down his surge , at least for a bit . The impeding effect is greatest on candidates about whom the public and press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenuous popularity . The latest example : Clinton , who was declared a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination before the New Hampshire primary but then was staggered by bombshells about his alleged extramarital affairs , draft status and experiment with marijuana . <P> There are signs that something similar is beginning to affect Perot , whose political views remain so undefined that voters have no idea where to place him on the political spectrum . This has worked to his advantage , as voters of all stripes invest him with their hopes . So far , his supporters are willing to take the chance that a tough businessman like Perot can succeed where timorous politicians have failed . In any case , they figure , he ca n't do any worse . But there is a much larger segment of the electorate reluctant to take the plunge until they know far more about Perot .
