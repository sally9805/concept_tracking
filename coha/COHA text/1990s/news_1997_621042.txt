<p> Putting aside centuries of division , five of the nation 's mainline Protestant churches are poised to enter a new era of cooperation , including the consolidation of local congregations and the mutual recognition of clergy . <p> Two separate agreements  --  one calling for " full communion " between the Episcopal and Lutheran churches , and another uniting the Lutherans , Presbyterians and two other Protestant denominations  --  face their final hurdle next month at the last of five summer church conventions . <p> Taken as a whole , these church unity votes are part of a broader realignment of American Christianity in the " post-denominational era . " <p> Churches with common views on the ordination of women and abortion rights are coming together in coalitions that blur traditional Catholic/Protestant boundaries . <p> Some see the ecumenical breakthrough as a long-overdue acknowledgment of what is already happening in pews and parishes across the nation . <p> " It 's not really changing anything , " said Episcopal Bishop William Swing of the Diocese of California . " It 's legislating the reality of what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-day meeting at the Philadelphia Convention Center , more than a thousand Episcopal bishops , priests and lay people have approved the proposed " Concordat of Agreement " between the 2.5-million member Episcopal Church and the 5.2-million strong Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) . <p> The agreement , the result of 30 years of ecumenical dialogue , would allow Lutheran pastors to celebrate the Eucharist in Episcopal churches , and vice versa . <p> It would also allow establishment of combined Episcopal/Lutheran congregations in small towns unable to support two separate churches  --  or in urban areas like San Francisco where the once- grand mainline churches have seen their congregations dwindle . <p> Presiding Episcopal Bishop Edmond Browning called his church 's approval of the concordat " a momentous advance in the movement of Christian unity . " <p> Next month , Lutheran church leaders will also gather in the City of Brotherly Love . Besides voting on the Episcopal concordat , they will control the destiny of this summer 's second church unity initiative . That " Formula of Agreement " would also bring " full communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 1.5-million- member United Church of Christ and the 300,000-member Reformed Church in America . <p> Ecumenical leaders see both agreements as a historic healing of sectarianism dating all the way to the 16th century Protestant Reformation inspired by Martin Luther , John Calvin and Richard Hooker , the " architect of Anglicanism . " <p> CONSERVATIVE ALLIANCES <p> Conservative Protestants , meanwhile , see the proposed agreements as compromises of core beliefs that will erode church traditions . <p> They are looking to the Roman Catholic Church to form new conservative alliances on social issues . Earlier this month , a new coalition of Catholic bishops , Southern Baptist leaders and other conservative evangelicals boldly announced a new political campaign . <p> Calling it a pact " without precedent in American history , " they issued a statement entitled " We Hold These Truths : A Statement of Christian Conscience and Citizenship . " <p> Binding the Catholic/evangelical coalition together is their common condemnation of legalized abortion . They also agree that women should be barred from serving as Catholic priests or evangelical pastors . <p> It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a more liberal view on abortion rights  --  and that they all ordain women as priests or pastors . <p> DIVIDED ALONG SOCIAL ISSUES <p> " What we 're seeing is a division between the more open and the more closed traditions , " said the Rev. Jan Womer , pastor of St. Marks Lutheran Church in San Francisco . <p> " Churches are cooperating around social issues , " he said . " Dividing lines are drawn over the role of women , gay rights and abortion , not around denominational ties . " <p> Womer favors the proposal uniting the Lutherans and the Episcopalians , as well as a separate agreement bringing together the Lutherans and three Reformed Protestant denominations . <p> Observers say the fiercest opposition to the Lutheran-Episcopal agreement will emerge next month when the Lutherans meet here . <p> All 30 regional synods in the ELCA have taken positions on the Episcopal concordat , and 15 have voted against it . It will require a two-thirds majority to be approved next month at the Lutheran convention . <p> Perhaps the greatest obstacle is lingering Lutheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bishops , something that dates back to Martin Luther 's 16th century battle with the Roman Catholic Church . <p> Lutherans and Episcopal theologians have come up with a new understanding of apostolicity  --  of how spiritual authority has been handed down over the centuries from the original 12 apostles of Jesus Christ . <p> " Both churches are now ready to affirm the other church as a church in the apostolic succession , " writes the Rev. Walt Gordon , editor of the Episcopal journal " Soundings . " <p> " Lutherans will now move to ensure that in the future their bishops are in the line of historic succession , and Episcopalians will acknowledge that bishops are not a law unto themselves , but serve under the authority of the Gospel . " <p> THEOLOGICAL DISAGREEMENTS <p> Complicating the Lutheran- Episcopal agreement are the Lutherans ' internal theological disputes . <p> The ELCA was born only 10 years ago through the merger of three small Lutheran denominations , which disagreed among themselves over the role of bishops . <p> In addition , the Lutheran-Episcopal accord will further separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unlike the Episcopal Church and the ELCA , the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod does not ordain women . It also takes a more fundamentalist view of Scripture . <p> Lutheran Bishop Robert Mattheis of the Oakland-based Sierra-Pacific Synod of the ELCA , said it is " ironic and painful " that the Episcopal agreement will further separate his denomination from other Lutherans . <p> Nevertheless , Mattheis favors the Lutheran-Episcopal concordat . And he agrees that it will face its toughest test when the ELCA holds its national convention in Philadelphia August 14-20 . <p> " There are those who will say we are becoming hierarchical and embracing something that is foreign to us , that conflicts with our identity , " Mattheis said . " But I think this allows us to present a unified ministry to our communities  --  to be in partnership rather than in competition . " <p> SEPARATE BUT LINKED <p> Like the Lutheran-Episcopal proposal , the Lutheran agreement with the three Reformed Protestant denominations is not an actual church merger . But it establishes full communion between the four churches , and would allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Reformed traditions have already approved the Lutheran agreement at separate church conventions this summer in Milwaukee ; Columbus , Ohio ; and Syracuse , N.Y . <p> The greatest obstacle to that agreement has been different understandings of the Lord 's Supper . Luther stressed the real presence of Christ in the bread and wine , while Reformed Christians have emphasized Christ 's presence in the gathering of the church community . <p> After 35 years of church talks , the Lutherans and Reformed Christians decided those differences were " complementary , " rather than " church-dividing . " They agreed to " allow significant differences to be honestly articulated within the relationship of full communion . " <p> Also unresolved is the fact that the United Church of Christ has a more liberal policy on the ordination of gay and lesbian ministers . Discussions to reconcile those differences would continue after " full communion " is established . <p> CHART : 5 PROTESTANT DENOMINATIONS ' PATH TOWARD UNITY Approximately 13 million Protestants are coming together this summer in a historic realignment of the American religious landscape , overcoming centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
