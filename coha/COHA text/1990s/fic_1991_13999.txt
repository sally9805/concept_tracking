In dim light , we see two men in buckskins holding long rifles , one leaning comfortably against a tree , the other squatting nervously beside him . Owls hoot in the darkness . Or it could be Indians signaling each other . Russell , the nervous one , drinks from his canteen . RUSSELL You got any opinion about this ? DANIEL BOONE No . I do n't . RUSSELL But you are thinkin ' about it , right ? DANIEL BOONE No . I do n't think I am . RUSSELL Why not ? DANIEL BOONE It do n't concern me , Russell . RUSSELL It does too concern you , and you know it . DANIEL BOONE All right , maybe it does . That still do n't mean I have to think about it . RUSSELL You know damn well what you think about this . You just do n't want to say it . DANIEL BOONE Well . Maybe I do n't . RUSSELL So why do n't you want to say it ? DANIEL BOONE Do you want to say what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're gon na kill us. p. 3 DANIEL BOONE Well , maybe they will . I 'd just relax , if I were you . RUSSELL How do you think they 'll kill us , exactly ? DANIEL BOONE Rush in , knife us . Hide in the bushes and shoot us . It 's hard to say . RUSSELL Both at the same time , or me first ? DANIEL BOONE You first . RUSSELL Be just my luck , they 'll kill me first , and then you 'll talk your way out of it . DANIEL BOONE I 'd have to try , Russell . RUSSELL ' Fore you know it , the whole gang of ' em would be walkin ' you back to their camp . " Hey , Blackfish , look what we got here . It 's Daniel Boone . " DANIEL BOONE Yeah . I could see somethin ' like that . RUSSELL Course you 'd eventually escape . DANIEL BOONE Maybe I would . RUSSELL Of course you would . Get home , get paraded around the fort . Get elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOONE No , I know . RUSSELL Well why not ? I 'd vote for you . If I were still alive , I mean . DANIEL BOONE If you want to try sneakin ' out of here right now , let 's go . p. 4 RUSSELL You think we could get past ' em ? DANIEL BOONE Probably not . RUSSELL But if we head back to the salt lick , they 'll just get the whole party . DANIEL BOONE I was thinkin ' if the Shawnee had all of us for the winter , they might not attack Boonesborough til the spring . RUSSELL I think about ' em sometimes , back at the fort , dryin ' tobacco , diggin ' wells . Wonderin ' where the hell we are . DANIEL BOONE Course now RUSSELL Yeah . DANIEL BOONE They could all be dead . RUSSELL I know . ( Daniel hears something , smiles , and comes up to a squatting position . ) DANIEL BOONE Well , Russell . Maybe our red brothers are gon na forget about us for the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord . Really ? DANIEL BOONE Nope . Here they come . ( And to the sound of a loud war cry , shrieking Indians come onstage in the darkness and attack them . A furious struggle begins . Boone and Russell are out-numbered , outfought , and finally , dragged offstage. ) p. 5 IN THE MUSEUMAnd then , an overhead light switches on , and we find we are not in the forest at all , but rather , in a museum , with painted backdrops of pioneer struggles , large cases of rifles and household equipment , huge stuffed birds and animal skins , etc . In the center of the room is a tree stump , on which is carved D. Boone Kill A Bar . 1803 . ZOIS . The person who turned on the lights is Flo , the night cleaning woman . She is in her mid 30s , and almost pretty , with long dark hair . She wears a long skirt and moccasins . Following her is Hilly , a young man wearing faded jeans and a black T-shirt . Flo pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mop and pail and the feather duster . FLO So . In this room , you start with the birds . Cause if you do the floor first and then do the birds , the dust from the birds will fall on the floor and you 'll have to do the floor all over again . HILLY Whatever you say , Flo . FLO I guess starting tomorrow night you can do it however you want . But tonight , you do it like I say , so I can know it 's done right . HILLY O.K. FLO What 's your name again ? HILLY Hilly . FLO And you be real careful around this tree stump . Daniel Boone himself carved his name right there . D. BOONE KILL A BAR . 1803. p. 6 HILLY O.K. FLO Now on these cases , you have to use Windex and a cloth . Not a paper towel . Not ever . It makes a streak . ( She gets a cloth . ) Like this . HILLY ( Beginning to get exasperated . ) Anybody can clean things . FLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HILLY What about inside the cases ? FLO You try and steal anything out of these cases and they 'll have you in jail , mister . HILLY Who said anything about stealin ' ? FLO You 've probably been in jail anyway . HILLY Do I look like I 've been in jail ? FLO You do . Actually . HILLY Well , what if I was ? FLO What did you do ? HILLY You know that statue of Daniel Boone in Cherokee park ? ( Her face pales as she remembers what happened to that statue . ) FLO That was you ? HILLY It was . FLO And they actually gave you this job after you did that ? p. 7 HILLY It was the judge 's idea . Somethin ' about my debt to society . ( Flo throws down her broom , and heads for the door . ) FLO I 'm going to get Mr. Wilson down here right now . I will not have a known vandal all by himself in this museum all night , I will not . ( He grabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . The judge told him all about it . FLO Well I do n't trust you . You 'll mess it up ! You 'll bring in your spray paint or your Boone I did for personal reasons . And I 'm not gon na do it again , becausebecause I 'm not . ( Changing tone . ) I 'll do this right . You watch . I 'll do it so good , they 'll think you did it . O.K. ? ( And suddenly , her attention is drawn away from him . ) IN A TEEPEE Daniel Boone is pushed into the room by a young Indian brave , who ties him to a totem pole , then leaves . IN THE MUSEUM FLO O.K. IN THE TEEPEE Chief Blackfish enters and walks up to Boone . Then all around him , studying him . Boone is badly beaten up . BLACKFISH So this is the famous Daniel Boone. p. 8 DANIEL BOONE Pleased to meet you , Blackfish . Where are all the others ? BLACKFISH You speak our language . DANIEL BOONE I speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bear . BLACKFISH Are you scared ? DANIEL BOONE Yes , sir . BLACKFISH Good . ( Chief Blackfish leaves . ) IN THE MUSEUM HILLY How long you been doin ' this ? FLO Start with the birds . HILLY Yes , ma'am . ( Flo sits down in the guard chair , and wraps a shawl around her shoulders . Hilly begins to dust the birds . ) IN THE TEEPEE Russell is thrown into the teepee , more or less at Boone 's feet . DANIEL BOONE Russell . RUSSELL They made you run the gauntlet . Why did you have to run it and not us ? DANIEL BOONE All part of the deal I made . ( Flo gets up from her chair . ) RUSSELL What else did you promise them ? How come we 're not dead ? DANIEL BOONE I said when spring came , I 'd lead the war party back to the Boonesborough , and they could capture everybody else too . Sell all our scalps to the British if they felt like it . p. 9 RUSSELL What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get ' em to relax , Russell . RUSSELL But you 're not really gon na do that , are you ? DANIEL BOONE Not unless I have to . ( Flo takes a piece of jerky out of her pocket , walks over to the teepee and hands it to Russell . Russell takes a bite , then looks at Daniel . ) RUSSELL Where 's yours ? DANIEL BOONE I ate already . ( Russell notices the look Flo is giving Boone . ) RUSSELL I do n't believe it . This Indian woman 's in love with you . DANIEL BOONE She does n't look like an Indian somehow . She looks like a white woman . RUSSELL She looks damn hostile to me . DANIEL BOONE I 've heard of this . Some lost white woman wanderin ' around out here . RUSSELL Does every damn thing you hear interest you ? DANIEL BOONE Do n't it you ? RUSSELL No , it do n't . DANIEL BOONE I think this girl knows more about this country than any man we know . Look at how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would n't even know she was here . p. 10 RUSSELL If we were n't watching , we would n't know we was here . ( Flo turns to leave the teepee . ) DANIEL BOONE ( To Flo . ) Hey . You do n't have to leave . Where are you goin ' ? FLO To get you some blankets . ( She leaves . ) RUSSELL What did she say ? DANIEL BOONE She 'll be back . RUSSELL Did you know this girl was in this camp ? DANIEL BOONE I reckon I did . IN THE MUSEUM Flo walks back to the guard chair and sits down . She pours herself a cup of coffee from a thermos . FLO Why 'd you do that to Daniel Boone ? HILLY Because he pisses me off . FLO He 's the best man who ever lived in Kentucky . HILLY See what I mean ? FLO He came through the Cumberland Gap and found Kentucky . He saved the fort at Boonesborough . HILLY And then named it for himself . FLO The other settlers named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't been there . p. 11 HILLY Come on , Flo . This was a guy went around writin ' his name on the trees . FLO He wrote his name on the trees because he just killed a bear and he had to stay awake all night watchin ' it . HILLY Is that what you do when you ca n't sleep ? Carve up your furniture ? FLO I watch TV . HILLY O.K. FLO O.K. what ? He did n't have a TV . HILLY He wanted to be a star . FLO He did not . He saved his daughter from the Indians . HILLY There 's not a man alive who would n't go save his daughter from the Indians . FLO What Indians ? HILLY It 's not my fault there are n't any Indians to save my daughter from . Daniel Boone chased them all away . FLO He did not . He liked Indians . HILLY Then where are they , huh ? ( He points to his work . ) How 's that look ? IN THE TEEPEE Chief Blackfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort ? p. 12 DANIEL BOONE Twenty , thirty , maybe . RUSSELL The Chief speaks English now ? DANIEL BOONE He does if he wants you to understand what he 's saying . BLACKFISH Do they have water ? RUSSELL They have water . DANIEL BOONE Not enough . But killin 's those people wo n't stop the rest of ' em you know . There 's too many of ' em . Just over the mountain . It 's like the mountain is a big dam holdin ' them back . BLACKFISH So is that why they have sent you , to find a way through the mountain ? DANIEL BOONE They did n't send me . I 'm justtryin ' to get out of their way . BLACKFISH They do n't belong here . This is Shawnee hunting ground . DANIEL BOONE No , I know . But the way white people see it , a place do n't belong to somebody unless they bought it . Just keepin ' it sacred , like you done , that do n't count . So as soon as this revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chase you off this land , divide it up , and buy it . BLACKFISH From whom ? DANIEL BOONE From you if you 'll sell it to ' em . The best way to let white people know somethin ' is yours is to tell them what you want for it . p. 13 BLACKFISH What would I do with the money ? DANIEL BOONE I do n't know . Is n't there something you want ? BLACKFISH I want the white man to get back . DANIEL BOONE Then sell him the land for his guns . BLACKFISH ( In disbelief . ) They would n't do that . DANIEL BOONE Try it . IN THE MUSEUM Flo laughs outloud . Hilly turns around to see what she 's laughing at . FLO Sorry . ( And he turns back to his work . ) IN THE TEEPEE BLACKFISH I think you could be very useful to us . DANIEL BOONE Could be . Can you untie Russell here , and the rest of the men , or do they have to stay tied up ? RUSSELL Whose side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your word that they wo n't attack our women ? DANIEL BOONE What do you say , Russell , can you keep yourself in line , here ? RUSSELL They took my gun , did n't they ? DANIEL BOONE ( To Blackfish . ) They 'll be O.K. for a while . p. 14 BLACKFISH Then we will untie them . But if they escape , we will kill you . DANIEL BOONE That 's fair enough . ( Blackfish leaves . ) RUSSELL So I ca n't run off or they 'll kill you ? DANIEL BOONE You can go whenever you want . RUSSELL And they wo n't kill you ? DANIEL BOONE Maybe they will . I do n't know . RUSSELL Do you just not care if they kill you ? DANIEL BOONE It 's not the worst thing that could happen . IN THE MUSEUM FLO Where are you from , Hilly ? HILLY Hart County . FLO I know Hart County . Mammoth Cave is just about my favorite place in the whole state . HILLY Is that what you 're gon na do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? FLO I 'm going to Boonesborough , if it 's any of your business . HILLY Did you used to go to Mammoth Cave with your boyfriend and smooch while they turned the lights out ? FLO When they turned the lights out , I looked back the way I came and saw the silhouette of Martha Washington on the wall . p. 15 HILLY You really looked at that ? FLO I think you better get back to work . HILLY I have to admit , though , I liked that Echo River . I always felt like you could step out of your boat , follow some dark passage with your torch , and come right up on John Hunt Morgan makin ' gunpowder under a ledge . ( Flo does n't answer immediately . But this is exactly what she wanted to do . ) FLO You went in your own boat ? HILLY Lot of times . What did you do ? Pay to go with a guide ? How many times did you do that ? FLO If you went in your own boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is there another entrance to the cave ? HILLY Well sure there is . I 'll take you there if you want , but I would n't count on seein ' John Hunt Morgan , if I was you . He 's dead . FLO So what if he 's dead ? Everybody I see here is dead . Dead people walkin ' the streets . Dead people askin ' me how I am . If I have to spend my life with dead people , I 'd rather be back there , where the dead people did things . HILLY I 'm not dead . How long you had this idea we was all dead ? FLO Then you tell me one livin ' thing you 've done . You think wrappin ' Daniel Boone up like a mummy makes you a livin ' human being ? p. 16 HILLY Are your folks all dead ? Your Mom and Dad ? How about your girl-friends ? You got anybody living in your building or anything ? ( She does n't answer . ) HILLY You 've just been goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the state historical things , lookin ' for a way in , have n't you . A way back into history , I mean . FLO They do it in the movies . HILLY Maybe you should go work in the movies . ( Flo wishes she had n't said any of this now . ) FLO Me ? HILLY Why not ? I 'd go see you . What time do you have ? FLO Eight-thirty . HILLY Is it O.K. if I go call Linda ? She 's about ready for bed by now . FLO It 's time for your break anyway . HILLY Thanks . ( Hilly leaves . ) ( Flo opens one of the cases and gets out a gun . ) IN THE TEEPEE RUSSELL So what 's the worst thing ? DANIEL BOONE I do n't know what you mean . RUSSELL You said gettin ' killed was n't the worst thing . p. 17 DANIEL BOONE No . RUSSELL So what is ? DANIEL BOONE Oh , I do n't know . Gettin ' marched back to North Carolina , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' buried in my cornfield . RUSSELL Well , I 'm goin ' back . DANIEL BOONE But what are you goin ' back for , Russell . Nothin 's gon na happen til the spring . And at least bein ' here , w 're eatin ' up the Shawnee 's food instead of what little they got left at the fort . RUSSELL What about Rebecca ? Do n't you think she 'd like to know you 're not dead ? DANIEL BOONE What she 'd like to know is if I 'm not dead , how come I 've been gone so long . RUSSELL Come on . Go with me . You could leave again as soon as you wanted . Surveyin ' , scoutin ' . Anything . There 's always somebody wantin ' to hire you . DANIEL BOONE I 'm not hirin ' out ever again , Russell . Every trail I blaze is gon na mean a thousand people followin ' me stompin ' it down . Every fire I build out here 's gon na have a homestead around it in five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is where Daniel Boone made his first camp in this county . p. 18 DANIEL BOONE But I ca n't quit leadin ' any more than they can quit followin ' , so right now , it 's just a flat out relief to be right here , where I ca n't go no further . ( A moment . ) Only thing that would make me happier is if I was tied up . ( Boone looks up as Flo enters the teepee . She is very glad to see him , but her affection is laced with some aggravation . She is carrying some blankets and a gun . She gives him the blankets . ) RUSSELL Well , look at that . FLO I got your gun back for you . DANIEL BOONE Thanks . ( Flo hands Boone the gun . He looks at it carefully . ) DANIEL BOONE This is n't my gun . FLO It has your initials on it . DANIEL BOONE No , I know . Russell here , goes around the whole world carvin ' my initials on things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to take you back home ? DANIEL BOONE Not right away . I was thinkin ' I 'd let ' emget the crops in first . FLO So what did you do ? Get yourself captured so we could go fishin ' ? DANIEL BOONE Maybe I did . What 's runnin ' ? p. 19 FLO Looks to me like you are . DANIEL BOONE Right into your arms , Flo . I sure am . ( She leaves . ) RUSSELL What was that all about ? DANIEL BOONE She said she 'd lead you out if you want . RUSSELL I am not draggin ' some Indian woman back to Boonesborough . DANIEL BOONE Well , that 's the difference between you and me , Russell . I never could say for certain what I was n't gon na do . ( Blackfish enters with Flo . ) BLACKFISH Shel-ta-we . DANIEL BOONE My father . BLACKFISH It is a wise leader that persuades his men to live peacefully with their enemy . DANIEL BOONE And it is a wise chief who treats his captives with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you she was trouble . BLACKFISH As a token of my friendship , I give you this woman for your wife . RUSSELL Your wife . What kind of pagan practice is that ? DANIEL BOONE I ca n't refuse him , Russell , you know that . p. 20 RUSSELL You do n't want to . DANIEL BOONE No . That 's true . Unless she objects . BLACKFISH I have spoken with her . She will abide by my wishes . IN THE MUSEUM Hilly comes back into the room , and Flo reappears from behind one of the cases . FLO Is Linda your wife ? HILLY My daughter . You ought a have a child , Flo , before it 's too late . You 'd like it . Make you forget every damn thing except how to do right by her . FLO I 'm not married . HILLY Well , get married then , if that 's all that 's stopping you . FLO No thanks . HILLY You got somethin ' against marriage ? Daniel Boone was married . FLO You lay off me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Flo . I ca n't see a nice girl like you throwin ' yourself away on a dead guy . ( A beat . ) Did n't you ever meet anybody you liked ? FLO Why are you askin ' me all this ? HILLY I want to know what you want in a man . FLO Why ? p. 21 HILLY So I can if I 've got it . FLO You ? HILLY Why not ? You want me to put on one of those buckskins ? FLO What I want , is to get through this night and never see you again . HILLY Flo . You never know when you 're gon na meet the right person . You ca n't count somebody out just because they 're available . FLO I am not attracted to you in the slightest . You have no interest in history , and no sense of responsibility to the present . HILLY How do you know that ? FLO You think women are so desperate to find a man that they 'll take anybody who 's even half-way nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-way if you 'd let me . FLO I 'm sure you would . But if there was any other woman in this building , you would n't look at me at all . HILLY Not so . I saw women all day today . And you 're the first one I wanted to talk to . FLO You 're playing with me and I do n't like it . HILLY Yeah , well , you 're ignoring me and I do n't like that either . p. 22 FLO I have responded to every single thing you 've said . HILLY You have not . You think I 'm a bum . FLO I do not . HILLY O.K. A criminal . FLO I think you talk too much . HILLY It takes a lot of talk to get through to you , Flo . I do n't like that name . What 's the whole thing , Florence ? FLO I have to go to the ladies . HILLY I 'll be here . IN THE TEEPEE Russell is preparing to leave . Boone is now dressed like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated very well . DANIEL BOONE So what 's your idea here ? RUSSELL Simple . Go back . Let everybody know you 're alive . See what 's goin ' on . Come back and get you . DANIEL BOONE Why do n't you just stay put if you get there . Give Rebecca a hand . File my claims , too , if you think of it . You know . Get the fort ready . RUSSELL When do you think they 'll attack ? DANIEL BOONE Not as long as I 'm here . But if somethin ' should happen to me here p. 23 RUSSELL That 's it , see . I do n't trust ' em . DANIEL BOONE Russell , we 've been here two months and all they 've done is traipse around , showin ' us off to their friends . Why do n't you wait til the braves are all out huntin ' next month . Go then . RUSSELL Cause you 'll probably go hunt with ' em . DANIEL BOONE Got ta earn my keep somehow . RUSSELL I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Squire would like to come . We 'll march right back here and DANIEL BOONE Russell . They 'll bring me back themselves as soon as they decide what to trade me for . You 're one of the few fighting men we 've got . If you get to Boonesborough , promise me you 'll RUSSELL Should n't be more than a month at the most . DANIEL BOONE If you 're so concerned for my well-being , then why do n't you just stay here with me ? RUSSELL Cause I 'm tired of watchin ' you and these Indians , if you want the truth of it , fixin ' their rifles , gettin ' yourself adopted , marryin ' this girl . It ai n't right . DANIEL BOONE We 've seen a lot of things , you and me . RUSSELL And we 'll see a lot more , once we get you out of this . p. 24 DANIEL BOONE It is n't me we 're worried about . RUSSELL I 'll be O.K. DANIEL BOONE Just stay off the trail , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't fight ' em . Just take your whippin ' and come on back here . RUSSELL Yes , sir . DANIEL BOONE So I 'll see you in a couple of hours . RUSSELL No you wo n't either . DANIEL BOONE Well I hope not . I had enough of arguin ' with you to lat me at least a month . ( But from the look on Boone 's face , we know Russell has very little chance here . ) IN THE MUSEUM Hilly is now working on the glass in the cases . Flo looks up as Mr. Wilson , a rather academic , but not unappealing man dressed in a shirt and tie enters , carrying a Polaroid camera . She seems nervous , but very happy to see him . At first , Mr. Wilson can not see Hilly . FLO Mr. Wilson ! MR . WILSON Oh hi , Flo . I 'm sorry to bother you . I meant to take care of this this afternoon , but the Board of Directors met until almost six , and FLO What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your book on Sycamore Grove ? p. 25 MR . WILSON Uh . No . They said maybe next year . ( A moment . ) Well , who knows . Maybe they meant it . FLO But you 're ready now MR . WILSON Yes . And by next year , who knows what it 'll be like . I mean there 's only that one sycamore left as it is . FLO But you 've applied to some other sources , have n't you ? Maybe ( Hilly appears . And at the mere sight of him , Mr. Wilson 's demeanor changes radically . It 's as if Flo disappeared . ) MR . WILSON Well , well . Who 's this ? ( Flo feels like she 's been dropped out a window . ) FLO This is Hilly , the new man . Hilly , this is Mr. Wilson . MR . WILSON Jeff , Jeff . I forgot this was your first night . Hilly , is it ? ( Now clearly fliriting . ) I see you have n't done any big damage yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . WILSON That would certainly be my approach . ( Flo has to get out of there . ) FLO Do you need me to do anything before I p. 26 MR . WILSON No , no . I just have to have a photograph of the Boone knife for the Quarterly . But Hilly can help me . ( He gets the knife out of the case . ) FLO I 'll be back in a minute , then . ( She leaves as quickly as possible . ) ( Suddenly alone with this handsome man , Mr. Wilson is very nervous . ) MR . WILSON ( To Hilly . ) So . Do you mind ? ( Mr. Wilson hands Hilly the knife , and proceeds to lay out a mat on which to photograph it . ) IN THE TEEPEE Boone is whittling . Flo rushes in . FLO How could you let them leave . DANIEL BOONE Did they get him ? FLO You let them walk right down the trail like they were invisible . DANIEL BOONE Did they get them both ? FLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DANIEL BOONE That 's something anyway . FLO But I told you I would help ! I could 've at least gotten them to the river . Goin ' by themselves , they made so much noise , I could hear them halfway across the village . They might as well have been singing . p. 27 DANIEL BOONE They probably were singing . FLO You have no business bringing these people out here . That other one just got himself killed trying to show you how brave he was . DANIEL BOONE I know that . FLO They do n't listen . They think they 're you . DANIEL BOONE I know . FLO Or what 's worse , they think because they 're with you , they 're safe . They think you know where you 're goin ' . DANIEL BOONE I have never said that . Never . FLO You do n't have to say it . How could Daniel Boone not know where he 's going ? DANIEL BOONE I have never known where I was going . That 's the whole point . Settin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I know where I 'm goin ' ? ( Suddenly , she is overcome with love for him . ) FLO No , I know . And how can they watch you go and not want to go with you . DANIEL BOONE Come here . ( Flo goes to him and he opens his arms and holds her for a moment . ) DANIEL BOONE What 's all that drummin ' about ? Are they gon na roast him ? p. 28 FLO They do n't care about him . They 're waiting for you to come out there to avenge him . DANIEL BOONE So they 're gon na roast me . FLO There 's some of ' em sure would like to . If you can manage to stay put til dark , I 'll come show you where they put him and we can bury him . DANIEL BOONE That 'd be good . Seein ' as I already dug the grave , the least I can do is put the man in it . FLO When did you do that ? DANIEL BOONE Little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shawnee say you do n't touch the ground when you walk . DANIEL BOONE ( Stroking her hair . ) Try not to . It 's quieter that way . IN THE MUSEUM Mr. Wilson begins taking pictures , Hilly holding the knife with its point piercing the piece of paper . Mr. Wilson is making a valiant attempt to resist the attraction he feels for Hilly . HILLY Did Daniel Boone really carve his name on that tree ? MR . WILSON Oh , please . HILLY He did n't ? MR . WILSON ( Referring to the knife . ) Now lay it down flat . Good . ( Then back to the subject . ) No , he did n't . The date is way off . Daniel Boone was in Missouri in 1803. p. 29 HILLY Possible he did n't know what year it was , I guess . MR . WILSON It is n't just that . The tree says , D. Boone Kill A Bar . Now if Boone used the past tense correctly in letters , why would n't he use it on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why would they do that ? MR . WILSON So they could sell it , to somebody . ( Mr. Wilson waits for a photo to come out of the camera . ) ( Hilly looks at the knife a moment , then holds the knife high over his head , like the statue of Boone . ) HILLY Guess who ? MR . WILSON ( Laughs . ) That 's good . ( He snaps a picture . ) HILLY What about the hunting shirt ? Was that his ? MR . WILSON Heavens , no Boone was big . That shirt would be snug on ( He looks at Hilly. ) either one of us . ( Hilly puts the knife down . Mr. Wilson waits for the pictures to develop . ) HILLY So what do you have that really belonged to Daniel Boone ? MR . WILSON That depends on who you talk to . p. 30 HILLY I 'm talking to you . MR . WILSON Nothing . HILLY You 're kidding . MR . WILSON Boone was captured so many times , the Indians ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , is a cast of his skull upstairs in the vault . HILLY What , did the indians tie him to a post and slap some plaster on his head ? MR . WILSON The impression was taken after his death , I believe . HILLY Jesus . ( Mr. Wilson laughs a little . in spite of himself . ) MR . WILSON But we do have a number of authentic Boone documents , land claims , things like that . And one ember carrier that , in all probability , came from the Boone household . HILLY I had an ember carrier once , but I forgot where I put it . MR . WILSON You are wondering why we have all these things on display if we know them to be fake . HILLY I am . You 're right . MR . WILSON It 's for the simple reason that even false views of historical personages are nevertheless , interesting to historians . ( Hilly 's real feelings begin to emerge now. ) p. 31 HILLY But people believe this stuff . They come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single arrowhead is something Boone found . MR . WILSON No she does n't , Oh , maybe when she first came here she did . HILLY But you straightened her out . MR . WILSON I did . IN THE TEEPEE Boone and Flo come in the teepee from burying the man who tried to escape with Russell . FLO Did you know him , that man we just buried ? DANIEL BOONE No , I did n't . Why ? FLO I just wondered if he had any family . DANIEL BOONE Probably does . FLO Will you have to find them and tell them something when you get back ? DANIEL BOONE Like I 'm sorry , you mean ? I could , I guess But I probably wo n't . For all I know , he might be better off . FLO Better off dead ? DANIEL BOONE I had a dream about dyin ' once . FLO You were dying , or you were dead ? DANIEL BOONE Dead . FLO How was it ? p. 32 DANIEL BOONE It was O.K. I knew a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He looks at her . ) You were there too . FLO I was ? DANIEL BOONE And heaven was a great big lake , early in the morning . The water was real still and kind of a gray blue . We were all just sittin ' there fishin ' , two , three people to a boat , drinkin ' our coffee and watchin ' the sun come up . FLO It 's gon na frost tonight . DANIEL BOONE That 'd be okay too . IN THE MUSEUM HILLY What 's the trouble ? MR . WILSON Hilly , Was any other staff member in here tonight ? HILLY No . Why ? MR . WILSON There 's a gun missing from this case , that 's all , but I 'm sure someone 's borrowed it and just forgotten to sign it out . Would you ask Flo to come see me when she comes back ? I 'm in my office . HILLY Sure . MR . WILSON Or you could come tell me she 's down here and I 'll HILLY I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come back down in a few minutes . p. 33 HILLY We 'll be here . IN THE TEEPEE Flo and Boone are more relaxed now . FLO Where are you going to go when you leave here ? DANIEL BOONE I 'd like to just keep goin , ' I guess . See the rest of Kentucky and keep goin ' , right on into places do n't even have names yet . ( A moment . ) Name them all after you . Look real good on a map someday . Here 's Virginia , here 's Carolina , and everything west of here is Flo . FLO I 'd like to see that too . Whatever 's out there . It would n't even matter if I liked it . I know I 'd like seein ' it . Maybe I 'll come with you . DANIEL BOONE I 'd like that . Probably would n't be any way of gettin ' back , though . Could n't keep goin ' if we kept turnin ' back . FLO That 's O.K. DANIEL BOONE ( Patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You and me . As soon as it 's warm FLO What about your family ? DANIEL BOONE Well , you 've got the right idea about family , Flo . It 's better to really be gone . Better than sittin ' there with ' em wishin ' you were gone . ( Flo picks up the gun and stands up. ) p. 34 FLO I 'll go get us a smoke . IN THE MUSEUM Hilly is working on the cases as Flo comes back in carrying the Boone gun . HILLY I 'm tryin ' this little treatment I use on our tile at home . Seems to be working pretty good . FLO Looks good . HILLY ( Noticing the gun she carries . ) The boss says there 's a gun missing from one of the cases . FLO I know . I just found it back there . Somebody probably forgot to sign it out . They do that all the time . What happened to your wife ? HILLY My wife ? FLO Yeah . How come your daughter is living with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're divorced . HILLY She 's dead . She was killed . We were nearly all killed . FLO Killed ? In an accident , you mean ? HILLY I do n't know . Maybe it was , maybe it was n't . FLO I know you for two hours and you 're just now telling me your wife is dead ? HILLY A lot of people are dead , Florence . It 's not your recommended way of starting a conversation , telling you everybody I know who 's dead . p. 35 FLO Did you cry ? HILLY Maybe I did . I do n't remember . I was too busy tryin ' to explain it all to Linda . FLO What did you say ? HILLY Everything I could think of . Her spirit is free . You 'll see her again some day . We only put her in a coffin so she wo n't get wet when it rains . You know . ( A moment . ) Lie . Lie . Lie . FLO And did she believe you ? Does she still want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found something more interesting to you than Daniel Boone . My dead wife . FLO You did n't kill her , did you ? ( A moment . ) HILLY I thought about it . FLO What does that mean ? HILLY It made me really mad , Florence , that she would do that to us . ( Flo feels she ca n't ask anything else . But Hilly relents and tells the story . ) HILLY We both saw the truck coming . I told her she did n't have room to pass . She said she did . That 's all . ( A pause . ) It was pretty much of a mess . And it was a long time before anybody came along . p. 36 FLO Were you drinking ? HILLY Would you get off this subject ? You have no right asking me any of this . And I have no desire to tell you any of it . You think the dead are still alive . Well , I 'm here to tell you they are n't . O.K. ? ( A moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think this is , T.V. ? FLO I do n't know what to ask . Who watches Linda while you 're at work ? HILLY Why do n't you ask how think you 're ever going to get work if you keep stealing things from the museum . Even on your last night . For God 's sake , Florence . They probably fired you . Is that what happened ? ( Mr. Wilson enters . ) MR . WILSON There you are , Flo . FLO ( Holding up the rifle . ) I found this in the back . Miss Carter sent it out to be polished . It just had n't been put in the case yet . ( Mr. Wilson takes the rifle and hands Flo one of the two pieces of paper in his hands . ) MR . WILSON Can you do me a favor and decipher these lines for me ? ( To Hilly . ) Flo 's our resident expert on Boone 's handwriting . Takes the rest of us two hours with a magnifying glass . All she has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . ) This one .

WILSON ( Handing her another document . ) And this one ? FLO " I am Well in health , but Deep in Bankruptcy . " HILLY So Boone was broke ? FLO He was . But he did n't write that last one . This looks to me like that Corbin woman again . MR . WILSON Good . Thanks . That 's what I thought . ( Mr. Wilson looks at Hilly , then at Flo . Then speaks to Hilly , or rather , dismisses him . ) MR . WILSON Would you excuse us for a moment . HILLY Sure . What do you need ? A half-hour , ten minutes ? MR . WILSON Five should do it . ( Hilly leaves . Mr. Wilson returns the gun to the case and locks it . ) MR . WILSON I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . I had hoped to get a little party together for you , so everybody could say good-bye . But . p. 38 FLO You were the only one I ever talked to really . MR . WILSON I mean , I really appreciate the care you 've taken with everything here . Do you think you could ( He pauses. ) . have dinner with me sometime ? FLO Have dinner with you ? MR . WILSON I mean , I 've wanted to ask you for quite a while now , but I was n't sure it was a good idea while we were still working together . FLO I thought you were living with someone . MR . WILSON He left . FLO I 'm sorry . MR . WILSON It was my decision , really . I 'm trying to ( He stops . ) I want to meet somebody . A girl . I want to get married . I think . FLO You think . MR .

We care about the same things . ( Flo is suddenly very angry . She tries not to explode. ) p. 39 FLO And I seem like the kind of person who would MR . WILSON I know it might be hard at first , but FLO I probably would n't even care if we ever had sex . I probably do n't even like it . I 'd just be so flattered that somebody from upstairs noticed me MR . WILSON I 'm sorry . This was a mistake . FLO Yes , It was . MR . WILSON I hope , I have n't offended you . FLO Why do n't you just MR . WILSON Go upstairs and drink . FLO No . Go home . Why do n't you just go home . MR . WILSON I do n't want to go home . FLO He 's still there , is n't he . MR . WILSON How can I ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ? FLO I do n't know . MR . WILSON Flo . Please . I do n't know anybody else . Could I just ask you one FLO What . MR . WILSON I do n't know what women want . I have a good income . And I 'm a decent , responsible man . I just want to know if that will be enough . p. 40 FLO In short ? MR . WILSON ( Gets the message . ) Ah . ( Hilly returns . ) HILLY All done in here ? MR . WILSON ( Very upset now . ) Yes , of course . We were just chatting . ( Mr. Wilson turns to Flo one last time . ) I could give you a ride home later if you wanted . FLO I have my car . Thanks . MR . WILSON All right . Good night , then .

FLO You mean go out with him ? p. 41 HILLY You know what I mean . FLO No , I know . ( He sees her regret and her isolation , and likes her for them . ) HILLY You 're all right , Florence . FLO I 'm just so mad all the time . Why am I so mad ? HILLY It 's O.K. I used to feel like that myself . FLO And what did you do about it ? HILLY After I quit drinking , you mean ? Well , I thought about what was making me mad , and one night , I went over to Cherokee park and FLO wrapped Daniel Boone up like a mummy . HILLY ( He grins . ) You got it . Made me feel great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of the same subject . ) FLO Did the truck turn over ? Did the truck driver die too ? HILLY Are you serious ? FLO I want to know . Was there a fire ? HILLY All right , Florence . What 's it worth to you ? FLO Never mind . I 'll just sit here and you can go work . p. 42 HILLY No , I 'll tell you what . Eat supper with me . Do n't go have your supper in the lounge or something . Sit here and have supper with me , and I 'll tell you the whole gory thing . FLO I did n't bring anything to eat . I usually just HILLY You eat what 's left in the refrigerator , do n't you . FLO I do . Actually . There 's always something nobody wants . HILLY Then I 'll share mine with you . But I have to warn you that Linda made it , so I hope you like cream cheese . Is it a deal ? ( Flo thinks about it a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEEPEE Blackfish walks in . Boone wakes up .

HILLY ( Checking his pocket for change . ) What kind of soda do you want ? FLO Root beer . HILLY You got it . p. 43 FLO Thanks . ( Hilly leaves . ) IN THE TEEPEE Chief Blackfish walks into the teepee . BLACKFISH Governor Hamilton has offered us twenty ponies , and one hundred pounds sterling for you . DANIEL BOONE Take it . BLACKFISH I think they will offer more . DANIEL BOONE Maybe they will . ( Flo walks into the teepee to stand beside Blackfish . Blackfish takes Flo 's hand , then speaks to Boone . ) BLACKFISH I think you have brought us great good fortune these few months . I think we will keep you a little longer . ( Blackfish leaves . ) DANIEL BOONE What 's this good fortune I 've brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't . It 's finally occurred to the Shawnee , and to the British , that since you 're sittin ' here , givin ' no sign of tryin ' to escape , this would be an ideal time to attack Boonesborough . DANIEL BOONE Does that mean we have to go back ? FLO You know it does . DANIEL BOONE O.K. then . We 'll leave as soon as it 's dark . p. 44 FLO You 'd get there faster without me . DANIEL BOONE Maybe . And maybe I would n't get there at all without you keepin ' me headed in the right direction . ( She picks up her bedroll . ) FLO Who is it you do n't want to see ? DANIEL BOONE It 's what I do n't want to see , Flo . Like all my friends gettin ' killed in this fight . FLO If you do n't go , they 'll be killed for sure .

( He kisses her lightly . ) O.K. Now . You 'll need somethin ' warmer to wear . ( He picks up his jacket . ) Put this on . You go get us somethin ' to eat and I 'll go steal us a coupla ponies and we 'll go . ( Flo takes off her shawl , and puts on his jacket , leaving her shawl on the floor of the teepee . Flo leaves the teepee . ) IN THE MUSEUM Hilly returns with his bag of lunch . HILLY Florence ? Florence ? ( He walks back to the teepee , finds it empty . He notices Flo 's shawl on the floor . He stoops and picks it up . ) ( She enters through another door , wearing the Boone jacket. ) p. 45 HILLY I found your shawl . ( Flo covers her alarm . Hilly notices the jacket . ) FLO Thanks . HILLY It was in the teepee . Nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what we 've got for supper , what do you say . FLO Were you hurt at all , in the crash ? HILLY I was laid up for a few weeks . Yeah . But I did n't have a job then , so it was n't like I had somewhere to go . FLO So your wife was mad at you for not getting a job . Is that what the fight was about ? HILLY Jesus , Florence . I got laid off . FLO Why ? HILLY They do n't tell you why they 're layin ' you off . They just do it . FLO What kind of work was it ? HILLY It 's nice to have somebody to talk to , is n't it , Florence . FLO It 's not my fault I do n't know how to talk . Who have I got to talk to ? ( He hands her a sandwich . ) HILLY Here . p. 46 FLO Thanks . HILLY I got Linda started eating these cream cheese and banana sandwiches . You know . Had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do when a kid wo n't eat ? I thought everybody liked to eat . The books tell you do n't make them eat , or they 'll have eating problems the rest of their lives . But if you do n't make them eat , they 're not gon na have the rest of their lives , are they . I do n't know why they write those books . FLO ( Chewing a bite of the sandwich . ) It 's very good . HILLY Same thing with sleeping . They tell you , " Just let the kid cry . " What they do n't tell you is what the hell you 're supposed to do while the kid is in there crying . ( He takes the bread off his sandwich . ) FLO I feel bad eating up your supper . HILLY She 's getting better about making the sandwiches , though . ( He picks out a big chunk . ) That 's almost what you 'd call a slice . Is n't it . ( And now from offstage , they both hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I know you 're here somewhere . FLO Oh , no . HILLY Who 's that ? p. 47 FLO My boyfriend . HILLY Your boyfriend ? If you 've got a boyfriend I want my sandwich back . ( She hands him the sandwich . ) FLO I have to get out of here . HILLY What do you want me to tell him ? ( Flo dashes into the teepee . A large man wearing shorts over a sweastsuit , appears , an envelope in his hand . ) RICK Where 's Flo ? Who are you ? HILLY Name 's Hilly . RICK Where 's Flo ? HILLY In the teepee . ( Rick charges over to the Teepee . ) RICK The hell she is . ( He tears open the front flap of the Teepee . Not finding Flo there , he turns back to Hilly . ) All right , wise guy . Where is she ? HILLY How should I know ? RICK Flo ! You come out here right now or I 'll tear this place apart . HILLY Can I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a divorce , and then I get this letter from Flo saying she 's leaving . p. 48 HILLY You 're married ? RICK What did she tell you about me ? HILLY Did Florence know you were married ? RICK That 's what I came here to tell her . After I told my wife about Flo , then I was gon na tell Flo about my wife . I love Flo . She knows I love her .

( And with that , the men leave by different doors calling for Flo . ) RICK Flo ? HILLY Florence . It 's O.K. He 's getting a divorce . IN THE FOREST Daniel Boone and Flo appear . DANIEL BOONE How long do you think it will be before they know we 're gone ? FLO They know it already . DANIEL BOONE Then why 'd they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fun at all burnin ' up Boonesborough if you were n't there tryin ' to stop ' em . p. 49 DANIEL BOONE That 's true . FLO So how come I do n't see you shakin ' with fear ? DANIEL BOONE I shake so fast , nobody 's ever seen it . ( She laughs and sits down . He opens a canteen and gives her a drink . Then he sits down behind her , and she leans back against him . He begins to stroke her hair . She turns around , as though she 's heard something . ) FLO Was that a bear ? DANIEL BOONE Brown . I think . FLO I 'm afraid of bears . DANIEL BOONE You should be . ( He puts his arms around her , and kisses the side of her face . ) IN THE MUSEUM Rick returns , more angry than ever .

He grabs Hilly by the shirt and pulls him up off the bench . ) RICK You are ! She 's leavin ' me to run off with you . HILLY I just met her tonight . I swear it . RICK Then how do you know she 's crazy ? HILLY She 's in love with Daniel Boone . RICK Very funny . ( Rick puts Hilly down as Mr. Wilson enters . ) MR . WILSON Flo ? HILLY AND RICK She 's not here .

Right . p. 51 MR . WILSON Right . ( To Hilly . ) What do you mean , she 's with Daniel Boone ? HILLY I mean , she 's found some kind of way of , I do n't know , she goes into the teepee and she 's gone . And she comes back with things , guns and things , wearing old leather jackets and smellin ' like a wood fire . RICK She always smells like a wood fire . HILLY And does she have a fireplace at her house ? RICK No . ( Mr. Wilson goes back to look at the teepee . ) HILLY Well , there sure as hell is n't one in here . Flo heard your voice and high-tailed it to Boonesborough . MR . WILSON You looked in the ladies , I guess . RICK I did . MR . WILSON All right . ( To Rick . ) I 'll check the parking lot . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) check the log cabin room and stay there . She likes you . RICK And what if we do n't find her ? MR . WILSON I do n't know . HILLY What do you mean , you do n't know ? We have to go get her . p. 52 AT BOONESBOROUGH Flo and Boone stand , inside a cabin . Boone 's Indian clothes show the effects of the journey . FLO Where is everybody ? ( A young woman enters . It is Boone 's daughter , Jemima Boone . ) JEMIMA Dad ! ( Boone embraces her . ) DANIEL BOONE Hello , Jemima . Where 's your mother ? JEMIMA They left . They went back to North Carolina . Everybody left . They thought you were dead . ( She looks at Flo . ) We all thought you were dead . What have you been doing all this time ? DANIEL BOONE Jemima , this is Flo . I found her out there , just wanderin ' around lost and half-starved . The Shawnee killed her man and child . JEMIMA I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back ? JEMIMA He came back a long time ago . He 's telling everybody that you could 've escaped when he did , but ( Squire Boone , Daniel 's brother , enters . ) SQUIRE Daniel , How did you get through ? DANIEL BOONE Hello , Squire . p. 53 SQUIRE Our scout just came back sayin ' there 's four hundred Indians out there armed with British rifles . DANIEL BOONE He 's right . I just talked to ' em . SQUIRE Talked to ' em ? What did they say ? DANIEL BOONE Oh , you know . Give us the fort . Things like that . ( A moment . ) They 've got this letter to us from Lt. Governor Hamilton . It says if we abandon the fort , and promise not to come back onto Indian land , the Shawnee will hand us over to the British and nobody will get hurt . SQUIRE And if we stand and fight ? DANIEL BOONE Well , then , I reckon we 'll all be killed . SQUIRE We 'll be lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort by sundown , Daniel . You have to tell our people something . DANIEL BOONE Something like what , I 'll stay and die if they will ? SQUIRE That 'd be enough , comin ' from you . DANIEL BOONE O.K. , then . Let 's go tell ' em that . SQUIRE ( Feeling much safer suddenly . ) How 've you been ? ( Boone claps his arm around Squire and laughs. ) p. 54 DANIEL BOONE Not bad . ( Then turning back to Jemima . ) Jemima , get Flo somethin ' to eat . ( They walk out of the cabin . ) IN THE MUSEUM Mr. Wilson enters a room we have n't seen before , in which stands a log cabin , to find Hilly dressing himself in the frontier clothes that were hanging on the wall . MR . WILSON What are you doing ? HILLY Going to Boonesborough . Did you find Flo 's car ? MR . WILSON It 's in the parking lot , all right . But maybe she 's taking a walk . HILLY She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it something I said ? HILLY More like everything everybody ever said . MR . WILSON Including me . ( Watching Hilly dress . ) You 're serious about this . HILLY You bet I am . I want her back . And if I have to steal her away from Daniel Boone then that 's what I 'll do . MR . WILSON I 'm going with you . IN BOONESBOROUGH Boone and Squire stand at the front gate of the fort . DANIEL BOONE Just see if you can keep everybody makin ' bullets , while I go out and tell Blackfish the decision . p. 55 SQUIRE I think I should come out with you . All the Indians have to do is kill you , and everybody else will just give up . DANIEL BOONE Squire , the Indians do n't want to kill any of us . I 'll be all right . Just tell your man in the blockhouse that if he sees me light out for the gate , do n't wait for some kinda signal , just open fire . IN THE MUSEUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier boots . MR . WILSON You did n't find her either , I guess . RICK Nope . I called her house . She 's not there . I called her mother 's house . She 's not there . And I called the police . HILLY What did the police say ? RICK Nothing , I got a machine . HILLY The police department has a machine ? ( Mr. Wilson reaches into the cabinet for a jacket and begins to put it on . ) RICK Yeah , you know , tell us your name and what happened and we 'll get back to you . What are you guys doing ? MR . WILSON ( To Rick . ) Hilly and I can take care of this . Why do n't you leave us your number and if we find out something , we 'll give you a call . p. 56 RICK O.K. Sure . I have to go over to the garage and change my ball joints anyway . Maybe I 'll stop back when I 'm done . ( Rick leaves . ) MR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed if you 're coming . And you can leave that attitude here . O.K. ? MR . WILSON You actually think we can step inside the cabin , wearing these clothes and be in Boonesborough ? HILLY I just hope she did n't change her mind and go somewhere else . MR . WILSON No , that 's where she was going , all right . It 's in her file upstairs . Reason for ceasing employment : going to Boonesborough . HILLY And that did n't seem strange to you ? MR . WILSON Well , sure , but she was n't herself lately . ( Mr. Wilson opens the case . ) But I have n't been myself either . The man I 've been seeing HILLY I do n't want to hear about it . Why did n't you just ask her ? " Hey , Flo . When you get to Boonesborough , what year 's it gon na be ? " ( Hilly reaches into the case and gets knives , guns , and powder horns for both of them . ) MR . WILSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 HILLY Damn right you should have . She was counting on you , and him , whatever his name is , Rick , to hear what she was saying and stop her . Catch on . That 's what she was hoping for , for somebody , somewhere , to catch on . But nobody did . MR . WILSON She seemed happy enough . HILLY Oh yeah ? What is happy enough ? She has n't killed herself yet ? The way I see it , you were her last hope , til I came along . MR . WILSON Then why did n't she say so ? HILLY If you have to tell your last hope that they 're your last hope , then it 's way worse than you thought . ( Mr. Wilson grabs a hat and puts it on . And then begins to get dressed . ) MR . WILSON Okay , Okay . What part of Boonesborough do you think we 're going to ? When they first built it , or all those little wars in 1777 , or HILLY What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siege . HILLY That 's probably it , then . Is there anything I ought to know ? MR . WILSON It 's September , 1778 . There are about thirty men , maybe twenty boys and a couple of women and some children inside the fort . Their powder supply is very low . For ammunition , they 're digging bullets out of the wall and melting them down . They have no bread , and only root vegetables and a little meat . They have a well , they dug that in 1777 , but p. 58 HILLY Just the highlights , O.K. ? MR . WILSON O.K. It 's hopeless . ( A moment . ) Boone has no chance . None . HILLY Good . ( Hilly opens the door to the cabin , peers in , then holds it open for Mr. Wilson . Mr. Wilson looks in . ) MR . WILSON What if we ca n't get back ? HILLY Florence gets back . MR . WILSON Not this time she did n't . HILLY Well this timeis n't over yet . After you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilly follows him. ) @x In the darkness , drums and Indian flutes are heard . Seated on a blanket downstage , Blackfish picks up a burning twig from the fire and lights a long pipe . As he passes it to Boone , a circle of dim light comes up on them . BLACKFISH In two days , the moon will be full . By that time , you must take your people and leave this fort , my son . DANIEL BOONE ( A moment . ) Yes , I know . That 's what you said yesterday . BLACKFISH Will you go ? DANIEL BOONE Look . To tell you the truth , even if we wanted to go , I do n't know if we could get everything packed in two days . You know , there 's all the venison we salted down , and all those candles we made BLACKFISH You can leave the meat for us . DANIEL BOONE Well , why do n't I send some out for your supper tonight . That way you can BLACKFISH If it was up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DANIEL BOONE Of course you would . And if it was up to me , I 'd just head west , but the fact of the matter is , I have to go along with the rest of my people in there and they 've decided to stay and fight . p. 60 BLACKFISH ( Very angry . ) But you will all die if you stay here . DANIEL BOONE No , I know . That 's what I told them . BLACKFISH Tell them what Dragging Canoe has said , " that a dark cloud hangs over this land . " That no Indians have lived here for many years because of this cloud . That the bones of the ancient men rise up in the night and kill him who sets his lodge poles in this place . ( Boone takes a moment , and then is struck by a great idea . ) DANIEL BOONE I know . How about ( A pause. ) if you go away instead of us ? BLACKFISH How aboutif we both go away ? DANIEL BOONE Good . O.K. BLACKFISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . They ca n't . BLACKFISH So we 're back to killing you . DANIEL BOONE I guess so . BLACKFISH In two days then . DANIEL BOONE Well . How about if we talk about it again tomorrow ? BLACKFISH I will see you tomorrow , my son . Perhaps after my belly is full of your meat , I will have some better ideas . p. 61 DANIEL BOONE Maybe you will . ( The light goes out on them , they exit , and the light comes up on ) BOONESBOROUGH And the whole stage now suggests frontier Boonesborough , complete with palisade , cookpots , and all the other trappings of frontier life . Flo and Jemima are seated near the cabin door , pouring melted lead into molds to make bullets . Behind them , a young man walks , as though patrolling the palisade , wearing a tall hat and carrying a rifle . FLO You pour and I 'll hold the mold . Easy now . JEMIMA I do n't think we 're going to FLO ( Interrupting . ) Watch what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shawnee having these boys walk around the palisade all day . They know how many of us there are .

SQUIRE Just because Daniel does n't know how much water 's down there , does n't mean there is n't enough . We 're gon na soak the roof now , or watch it burn later , and those are his exact words . p. 62 JEMIMA Daddy 's putting all our water on the roof ? SQUIRE There 's a regiment of Virginia militia on their way , Russell . All we have to do is hold the fort til they get here . RUSSELL And what are they gon na see , huh ? A big battle goin ' on ? No . Everybody slaughtered ? No . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' around scratchin ' their heads , wonderin ' why all the white men died of thirst .

Have you been down there ? You think Dad knows everything . You 'd do whatever he said . FLO Yes , I would . And everybody else better too or wo n't any of us get out of this . JEMIMA We 're not going to get out of this . I should 've gone home with Mother . We 're going to die here . ( Russell is seen sneaking a long drink from his canteen . Boone comes up to him . ) DANIEL BOONE There you are . RUSSELL I know that . DANIEL BOONE Did you check that powder supply ? p. 63 RUSSELL Not more than two days worth , I 'd say . DANIEL BOONE That 'll have to do , then . RUSSELL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you wanted me to . Maybe they 've got some they could spare us . DANIEL BOONE No . We need you more than we need the powder . RUSSELL But what if the fight lasts longer than two days ? DANIEL BOONE I do n't see how it can , Russell . I mean , once we run out of powder , it 'll end pretty quick . ( Boone grabs the canteen away . ) What 've you got here ? ( Boone opens it . ) RUSSELL What do you think it is . Whiskey . DANIEL BOONE I knew it . ( And to Russell 's surprise , Boone takes a swig . ) DANIEL BOONE Thanks . ( Squire enters . ) SQUIRE Blackfish is signaling he 's ready to talk , Daniel . DANIEL BOONE O.K. I 'm comin ' . ( Flo sets one mold aside and picks up another one . ) JEMIMA How old was your child ? ( Flo hesitates , trying to remember the lie she and Boone worked out. ) p. 64 FLO Four . JEMIMA And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) FLO Forty  --  Forty , I think . JEMIMA Did the Indians scalp them or knife them or torture them or what ? FLO No , they justdragged them off I guess . Maybe it was n't even Indians . They 'd just gone down to the river to get water and when they did n't come back , I went looking for them , only all that was left was JEMIMA Was what ? FLO ( Has no idea what to say . ) Their hats . JEMIMA And that 's where Dad found you ? FLO I guess my mind must 've gone blank or something . Because the next thing I knew , your Dad was giving me a drink of water and asking me who I was . JEMIMA Where are the hats now ? ( Flo can not for the life of her think of an answer to this . A look of pain comes across her face . ) FLO ( Quoting Hilly . ) You do n't have any right asking me any of this . And I have no desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats ? " What do you think this is , a story I made up ? p. 65 JEMIMA I 'm sorry . ( They hear the sound of drumming . ) JEMIMA ( Seeing her father at some distance . ) Daddy is opening the gate ! FLO He 's showing them he 's not afraid . ( Russell enters with a pan of bullets . ) RUSSELL He is not . He 's daring them to shoot him so he can die first . ( Then picking up some bullets from Flo . ) Are these ready ? JEMIMA What do he and Daddy talk about when he goes out there ? FLO They 're trying to work out a treaty , I think . JEMIMA What kind of a treaty ? I thought we all voted to get killed . RUSSELL Is this all you done ? Lord God . I 'll get you some help over here . ( Russell exits . ) FLO Thanks . JEMIMA Then is Daddy a traitor ? Colonel Calloway says FLO Do n't you believe what anybody says , Jemima . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country . JEMIMA He is not . He 's afraid of Mother . He 's afraid of Colonel Calloway . He 's afraid of the British . He 's afraid of the whole state of North Carolina . And most of all , he 's afraid of honest work . p. 66 FLO Is that what your mother says. ? JEMIMA Well she ought to know . FLO I 'm sure she worries about him , when he 's gone . JEMIMA She does n't even sleep . Not one minute . How would you feel if you had six children and your husband was ( Squire enters and interrupts . ) SQUIRE Jemima . Your Dad says come out to the gate right now . JEMIMA What for ? SQUIRE The Indians want to see you . Some of them are the same ones that stole you away that time , and they want to see you . JEMIMA I wo n't go . ( Flo grabs her by the arm and takes her over to Squire . ) FLO Yes , you will go , young lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was dangerous sothere . Now go . JEMIMA Squire , please , do n't make me go . I do n't want to go out there . ( And as she continues to protest , Squire leads her away . And then , as Flo returns to her work , the cabin door opens slightly . And then opens further , and Hilly steps out . ) HILLY ( Whispering . ) Florence . Hey Florence . ( Flo turns and sees Hilly. ) p. 67 FLO Hilly ? ( He looks both ways , as though he 's crossing the most dangerous street in America . And then steps out . ) HILLY Well I 'll be damned . FLO What are you doing here ? HILLY I came to get you . ( He walks on over to her . ) FLO Why ? HILLY Why do you think ? To take you back . FLO I do n't want to go back . And even if I did , why would I go back with you ? HILLY You must 've wanted me to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were going . ( Mr. Wilson pokes his head out of the cabin now . ) FLO Mr. Wilson ! HILLY And once he knew I was coming , he came along to pick up some stuff for the museum . ( Mr. Wilson is holding an ember carrier . ) FLO You ca n't stay here . I wo n't let you . ( She sees Mr. Wilson pick up something . ) FLO Put that down . HILLY From the looks of things , I 'd say Mr. Boone could use two more men . ( To Mr. Wilson . ) Too bad we did n't bring some real guns , huh , Wilson ? p. 68 FLO You two go right back in that cabin and go right back to the museum right now . ( Boone enters . ) DANIEL BOONE Flo , we need those bullets as soon as they 're done . And you two , ( He points to Hilly and Mr. Wilson. ) we just lost a man from the blockhouse , so one of you get up there and take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from DANIEL BOONE I do n't care where they came from . What 's your name ? MR . WILSON Wilson . DANIEL BOONE Get up there in the blockhouse , and see if you can keep from gettin ' shot in the head . And you ( He points to Hilly . ) Come with me . ( Boone leaves . ) MR . WILSON ( Looking around . ) Let 's see . The blockhouse . The blockhouse . HILLY ( Points . ) Up there . ( Mr. Wilson leaves . ) FLO Please , Hilly . I appreciate you bein ' worried about me , but HILLY I ca n't talk right now , Florence . But you look real good , and I 'm glad I found you . So I 'll see you later . O.K. ? p. 69 FLO I do n't want you here . HILLY Then it 's a good thing you 're not in charge . ( Calling after Boone . ) Daniel Boone . Wait up . ( Hilly rushes off . ) ( Flo sits down , weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . ) RICK Son of a bitch . ( Flo turns around . ) FLO Not you too . RICK What did you think , I 'd be to scared to come ? I 'd just stand there and watch those two jokers come to the rescue ? ( She shakes her head . ) RICK I just did n't want to come with them , that 's all . FLO But you could get killed here . RICK I had some stuff I wanted to talk to you about . FLO The way my day is going , you 're probably married . RICK I should 've told you right off . But I was afraid you would n't keep seein ' me . FLO Well , you were right there . RICK I 'm sorry . I just told my wife I want a divorce . Will you marry me , Flo ? p. 70 FLO I do n't think so . Thanks , though . RICK Why not ? You said you wanted to have a child . Well I want to have a child too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have a child . Now you 'll say anything I want wo n't you ? RICK I had no idea you were serious about this . FLO I only told you a hundred times . RICK And I was supposed to believe that ? Believe you wanted to live at Boonesborough ? Believe you were in love with Daniel Boone ? FLO You did n't even think I was crazy for saying it . You did n't even say I should go see a doctor . You have no idea how hard it was for me to tell you those things . And all you did was laugh . RICK ( Deliberately . ) I wo n't ever do that again . FLO Not to me , you wo n't . At least Hilly believed me . RICK That hayseed . He 'd believe anything . FLO You still do n't believe it . Even standing here inside the fort , you do n't believe it . ( An arrow whizzes by him , nearly missing his head . ) RICK All right . I believe it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . ( Russell appears. ) p. 71 RUSSELL ( To Rick . ) You . Do n't I know you from FLO He 's just leaving . RUSSELL No he 's not , either . Boone wants a party to go out and kill a buffalo , and ( Pointing to Rick. ) he 's it . RICK ( Quietly , to Flo . ) I 'm the buffalo ? RUSSELL ( Very irritated . ) Why the hell is Boone feeding those savages ? FLO He 's just trying to prove to them that we have food . RUSSELL So we 're supposed to starve in here ? FLO We are if it keeps them from attacking . RUSSELL ( To Rick . ) Get goin ' you . One of the boys just spotted a buffalo down by the spring . Unless the Indians got it already . And do n't get yourself scalped out there or you 'll be sorry . ( Russell leaves . ) RICK I ca n't kill a buffalo . ( She hands him the gun lying on the ground beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very slow . RICK Will you feel better about me if I come back with one ? p. 72 FLO No . RICK Yes you will , too . ( And with that , he tromps off toward the gate . ) AT THE FRONT GATE Boone offers Hilly a bucket of water . DANIEL BOONE Want a drink ? HILLY Sure . Why not ? DANIEL BOONE Spill as much as you can while you 're drinkin ' it . I want Blackfish 's boys to get really thirsty just watchin ' you . HILLY Why have n't they attacked already ? DANIEL BOONE Could be a lot of things . ( Boone throws the whole bucket of water on the ground . ) Maybe one of the other Chiefs is n't here yet . Maybe the medicine man says it is n't the right time . Maybe Blackfish is waitin ' for us to offer him more money than the British . HILLY And maybe he knows if they start fightin ' , one of his braves might kill you . And then he could n't capture you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boone has a growing appreciation of Hilly . ) DANIEL BOONE Where 'd you say you were from ? HILLY Up north . DANIEL BOONE You want to walk out and sit a spell with us ? p. 73 HILLY Sure . DANIEL BOONE Florence is gon na come translate , in case we run into anything complicated . FLO ( To Boone . ) There 's somethin ' you need to know about him . He 's DANIEL BOONE He 's part Indian , I can tell you that much . ( To Hilly . ) Let 's go . ( Boone gives Squire his rifle to hold . ) FLO ( To Hilly . ) Is that true ? HILLY Yes , Ma'am . ( Boone puts his arm around Hilly and they leave Squire behind . ) DANIEL BOONE ( To Hilly . ) So how 's it goin ' up north ? HILLY Pretty quiet . Everybody 's workin ' so hard , nobody much feels like they 're doin ' anything . DANIEL BOONE Work is like that . HILLY Feels like all the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you supposed to amount to anything if you 've got all this crap you have to do . DANIEL BOONE Got to do it though , or else you 'll wind up like me , always wonderin ' where everything went . Did n't I have some land around here somewhere ? Anybody seen my wife ? p. 74 IN THE BLOCKHOUSE Mr. Wilson is standing guard , pointing his rifle out the hole in the wall . Russell pokes his head up into the blockhouse to talk . RUSSELL Boone said there was a new man up here . ( Mr. Wilson adopts a new way of speaking , what he imagines to be a frontier dialect . ) MR . WILSON Wilson . Yeah . What 's goin ' on out front ? RUSSELL Nothin ' . I want to know where you stand , Wilson . MR . WILSON Right here , sir . As long as you say . RUSSELL Where you stand on Daniel Boone , mister . MR . WILSON What do you mean . RUSSELL The man hides out with the Indians for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Spends all his time out there talkin ' with that savage like he was his old friend . I say let 's chain Daniel Boone to the gate and get the hell outta here , every man for himself . MR . WILSON What about that women and boys ? RUSSELL What about ' em ? ( Mr. Wilson summons his courage and hopes his dialect will hold . ) MR . WILSON They would n't stand a chance and you know it . I 'm stickin ' with Boone . I figure if I 'm gon na die , I 'd just as soon go with people I know . p. 75 RUSSELL Nobody knows Boone . Nobody ever will . He did n't come back to save this fort , he came back to give it to the British and walk away from it . If we get out of this , the first thing I 'm going to do is charge him with high treason . MR . WILSON You 're just scared , is what you are . Why do n't you crawl back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through here . ( Russell , filled with disgust and hatred of this newcomer , turns and leaves . And Mr. Wilson sights down his rifle and repeats his little speech , sounding like every hero he ever heard . ) MR . WILSON You 're just scared , is what you are . Why do n't you crawl back into your little rat hole and stay there til we get through here . AT THE INDIAN BLANKET Boone is seated on the blanket opposite Blackfish . BLACKFISH So . You 've finally decided to surrender . ( Boone laughs . ) DANIEL BOONE We have actually . ( From behind him , Hilly gets into the spirit of things . ) HILLY But everbody 's so excited to meet you , we 're kinda havin ' some trouble gettin ' ' em to line up right . ( Boone has a look of great relief . Like finally , he 's got some help. ) p. 76 DANIEL BOONE Yeah , you should see them . Me first , no , me first . HILLY So while they 're workin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought a come out here and talk about how 're you 're gon na torture us after we give up . ( Boone laughs and motions for Hilly to come sit down beside him . ) BLACKFISH A worthy discussion . Every tenth man I will give to the warriors to do with as they like . The others I will turn over to the British . As for the women , there will be no torture for the women . The women I will keep all for myself . DANIEL BOONE That sounds good . ( He turns to Hilly . ) That sound good to you ? HILLY Except for Florence . DANIEL BOONE Well of course except for Flo . ( He looks back at Flo . ) Flo you must save for me . HILLY ( Looking back at Flo . ) No , no . Florence you must save for me . ( Boone immediately seizes on this as a delaying tactic . ) DANIEL BOONE He will not . This woman is mine . If you need a woman , you can have my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Florence , and I 'm not leaving without her . You 'll have to kill me to get that woman and I 'm ready to fight you any time you say . p. 77 DANIEL BOONE ( Enjoying this immensely . ) You little thief . I do n't even know you . I never walked any path with you . You just show up here aimin ' to take my whole joy in life away from me , in front of my friends . ( Hilly stands up . ) HILLY It 's not my fault she 's all you 've got . If you had n't always been runnin ' around tryin ' to be the first man to see every tree What are you afraid of anyway , that if you stay put they might find out about you ? ( Boone stands up . ) DANIEL BOONE Find out what about me , you little BLACKFISH We will do no more talking until this matter is settled . You will fight for her . FLO No you will not . I am not some prize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIEL BOONE Just stand back , Florence . FLO Hilly , this is ridiculous . All they need is to see Daniel Boone worn out from beating you up , and they 'll start the attack right now . HILLY No they wo n't either . As soon as I whip his ass , they 'll know we 're every one of us as tough as Daniel Boone , and if that 's true , they can never beat us . They 'll light out of here as fast as they can . ( Flo turns to leave. ) p. 78 FLO I 'm having no part of this . None of thishas anything to do with me . BLACKFISH Go then . Remain with the women . I will send a messenger when you are needed . ( Flo leaves . Hilly takes off his shirt . And as Boone and Hilly are circling each other , Flo joins Squire , Russell , and Mr. Wilson who are watching , from the front gate . ) AT THE FRONT GATE Russell stands with Squire and Mr. Wilson . RUSSELL What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daniel 's little-tricks to me . Have a little fight . Waste a little more time . Well , what can it hurt . When the Indians see how Daniel humiliates this man they 'll know who they 're up against anyway . MR . WILSON Hey now . Do n't count Hilly out , here . He 's not as slow as he looks . ( The fight begins . ) FLO I ca n't watch . MR . WILSON Come with me to the east palisade , then . There 's somethin ' funny goin ' over there . ( Flo and Mr. Wilson exit . A circle of light forms around Boone and Hilly . Hilly takes the first swipe . Boone counters well and Hilly goes down . An Indian pitches Boone a large staff . Boone looks at it , pitches it to Hilly , Hilly holds it , looks at it , and pitches it back to the Indian . And the fight begins. ) p. 79 SQUIRE Uh-oh . JEMIMA Daddy . RUSSELL What 'll we do now . SQUIRE Not a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start right here . ( We hear the sounds of cheering , the thumps of the blows . Boone seems winded and out of shape , compared to Hilly . But Boone is sneaky . There are some moments when we think they are just playing with each other , but then Boone begins to take it seriously , and finally , wrestles Hilly to the ground and forces him to give up . ) DANIEL BOONE Say it , You thief . Flo is mine . HILLY I wo n't . You 're dead . DANIEL BOONE You will . The man has n't been born that can beat me , at this or anything else . Now say it . ( Blackfish lets out some kind of warrior cheer . But Hilly will not give in . ) HILLY You 've got a wife . If she still wants anything to do with you . What about her ? Florence is mine . ( Boone looks up , seeing someone arriving in the Indian camp . ) DANIEL BOONE Well . I 'll be HILLY What . DANIEL BOONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for , have arrived . p. 80 HILLY Who are they ? DANIEL BOONE The British one is new to me . But the Chief standin ' beside him is a real mean character . When he shows up , you know the talk is all over . ( Blackfish approaches . ) BLACKFISH I must go and greet my brothers . As for you , my son has beaten you . The woman he calls Flo , and you call Florence , is his . You will leave the village by sundown . HILLY I wo n't . BLACKFISH You will . DANIEL BOONE He ca n't . HILLY I wo n't . BLACKFISH Whatever . ( Blackfish begins to walk away . ) ( Boone stops him . ) DANIEL BOONE Hilly ca n't leave the camp because I need him . And Flo ca n't be mine because I 've got a wife . and the way we do things is a man can only have one wife . Now we enjoyed the fight and all , but this thing 's not settled yet . BLACKFISH Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! Now I 've told you how this thing has to go . BLACKFISH All right . If my son does not want this woman he has won , he can give her to you . p. 81 DANIEL BOONE Good . That 's what I 'll do then . HILLY All right . ( Blackfish starts to move away again . Boone catches him . ) DANIEL BOONE But I would ask for the son 's privilege of having the marriage performed in the lodge of my father . BLACKFISH And I would agree to anything to end this conversation . DANIEL BOONE Done . ( Blackfish leaves . Hilly grins at Boone . ) HILLY Done . DANIEL BOONE ( Looking after Blackfish . ) I 'm gon na miss him . AT THE EAST PALISADE FLO I 'm sorry I got so mad at you , when you asked me out to dinner . MR . WILSON Why should n't you be mad ? I did n't give one thought to what you might be feeling . FLO The truth is . I had such a crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum . I thought you were the handsomest , the smartest , the most charming man I 'd ever seen . And it took me so long to accept that you would never be interested in me , that last night , when all of a sudden , you were interested in me MR . WILSON For a minute . p. 82 FLO I could 've killd you . MR . WILSON No , I know . FLO I wanted to knock you down and jump on you . Throw you into the Boone street and crash my cart into you . Yell horrible things at you , tie you up and swat you with my mop and MR . WILSON Go on . FLO You 're not mad ? MR . WILSON Of course not . I like you . I want you to be happy . If it would make you happy to hit me with a mop FLO ( Laughing with him . ) Stop . MR . WILSON Come on . You have to see this . ( They duckwalk up to the edge of the palisade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little mound of dirt at the edge of the forest . So are you serious about this Rick ? FLO He 's very sweet . But if I had known he was married , I would never have started seeing him . MR . WILSON Well , of course you would n't . So is there anybody else ? Now what about Hilly ? I mean , I like him . And it 's obvious he 's crazy about you . And you know what ? I think my therapist is crazy . I do n't want to get married , I 'm fine just the way I am. p. 83 FLO Of course you are . MR . WILSON Maybe my therapist wants to get married . ( Squire approaches with Boone and Hilly . ) MR . WILSON ( Referring to them . ) There they are . Squire ? Daniel ? Come see what you make of this . It looks like the Indians are digging a tunnel . I think they 're trying to tunnel under the fort . SQUIRE I think you 're right . DANIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian digging a tunnel ? SQUIRE What should we do ? MR . WILSON I say we start a tunnel of our own , aimin ' to cross theirs , but underneath it , so where the two tunnels meet , theirs will collapse . DANIEL BOONE You think that would work ? MR . WILSON I know it would . SQUIRE O. K. , then . Get some of the boys and get on it . DANIEL BOONE Where 's your rifle , Wilson ? MR . WILSON I had to give it to that Timmy . In the blockhouse . DANIEL BOONE ( Hands his rifle to Mr. Wilson . ) Here . Take mine , then . Good work . ( Mr. Wilson takes the rifle with a look of absolute awe . Flo is not eager to hear about the outcome of the fight. ) p. 84 DANIEL BOONE Now . Flo . FLO If it 's anything to do with that fight , I do n't want to hear about it . DANIEL BOONE You 're Hilly 's woman . Fair and square . Blackfish says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge of his sons , and in the morning , you 'll be man and wife . FLO That 's what you think . ( She leaves . ) HILLY Florence ( Boone grabs him to keep him from running after her . ) DANIEL BOONE No sense chasin ' the girl . Where 's she gon na go ? ( Hilly is n't so sure of that . ) DANIEL BOONE She 'll come around . You 'll see . I 'll talk to her . First time I ever saw her that scared though . HILLY That 's because I 'm so mean . DANIEL BOONE Well , what do you say we go back out there and hear what kind of treaty the British have dreamed up . HILLY O.K. ( They turn and walk offstage . ) DANIEL BOONE You know , if you have n't got any place special to go after this , why do n't you come on back to North Carolina with me. p. 85 HILLY Thanks . DANIEL BOONE So you 'll come ? HILLY Probably not . ( A moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT THE FRONT GATE Flo stands at the front gate fuming . JEMIMA Did you mind just go blank again ? FLO Your Daddy 's tryin ' to marry me off . JEMIMA That 's nice . FLO I wo n't do it . JEMIMA But if you do n't get married , where will you go after this ? Cause you ca n't come home with us , you know . Mother is there . FLO No , I 'm not coming home with you . JEMIMA Oh , that 's right . I forgot . We do n't have to go anywhere after this . We 're going to die . ( Greatly relieved , she waves . ) O.K. Good luck . ( Jemima exits and Flo looks up and sees Rick enter dragging the carcass of a buffalo . ) RICK So . What do you think ? Pretty good , huh ? Lotta damn meat , on this thing . FLO Uh-huh . p. 86 RICK What 's the matter ? FLO I want you to take me home . RICK ( Speaking so no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum , you mean ? I ca n't . Not for a while , anyway . I saw a coupla more of these dudes down there at the spring , and I figure I might as well get them too while I 'm at it . FLO Oh , forget it . I 'm beginning to understand why the rest of the women left already . RICK Besides , it 's perfectly clear to me I 'm out of the running here . FLO What running ? What are you talking about ? RICK For you , Flo . These guys have got it all over me , any day . Hilly fighting Daniel Boone . Mr. Wilson figuring out about that tunnel . What have I ever done ? Kept the garage open so people can get another two years out of their old car ? FLO What 's wrong with that ? RICK I know , I know . Dad would love it if he saw the thing was still going . The kids like to come over and crawl under the cars . I mean , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the last ten years . FLO That 's because they do n't know what they 're doing . p. 87 RICK Look , Flo . You want a hero . You deserve a hero . Now , I 'm a nice enough guy and all , but I 'm the first one to say it . Fixin ' a guy 's transmission is n't exactly a heroic act . FLO It is if it 's really fixed . RICK Thanks . ( She looks at him a moment . Then down at the buffalo . ) FLO They owe you the tongue for killing it . RICK That 's O.K. They can have it . FLO No . You eat it . Or dry it , if you want to . Doubled over , a dried buffalo tongue would make a nice pouch for a wrench , or something . RICK O.K. Great . I 'll do that . ( Squire comes up to Rick and Flo . ) SQUIRE Looks like Daniel and Blackfish are about finished out there . FLO But the Virginia regiment is n't here yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they turned back . FLO They 're not coming ? SQUIRE Nobody 's coming . This treaty better be good . God help us . THE CABIN Seeing Boone and Hilly returning from the Indian encampment , Jemima , Russell and Mr. Wilson come up to where Squire , Rick , and Flo are standing . Rick has still not adopted the use of a frontier dialect . JEMIMA They 're coming in . Open the gate . Open the gate . p. 88 RUSSELL So what do we think this treaty says ? We all agree to become Indians and tear the fort down for ' em ? ( Rick and Mr. Wilson move slightly apart from the others . ) RICK What 's his problem ? MR . WILSON Who cares ? What 's that all over your shirt ? RICK Blood of the buffalo , man . MR . WILSON Wait a minute . That 's not your shirt . That 's our shirt . You took that shirt right out of the case . RICK And shot your dinner in it , yes , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilly and Boone come up to the group . ) DANIEL BOONE O.K. It looks like we got somethin ' to talk about anyway . ( He hands his handwritten paper to Squire . ) MR . WILSON ( To Rick . ) Do you have any idea what that piece of paper would be worth ? ( As Flo moves to avoid standing near Hilly , Squire reads from the paper . ) SQUIRE " There will be no battle . There will be peace between the white men and the red men forever . " ( He looks up . ) I do n't understand . p. 89 JEMIMA Does that mean we can we stay here ? They 'll all go home and we can stay here ? RUSSELL No , it does not . It means there 's somethin ' he 's not tellin ' us . DANIEL BOONE I do n't know what it means . Except that Blackfish is n't calling the shots any more . SQUIRE Who is ? DANIEL BOONE Some Frenchy lieutenant in the British army , and Chief Moluntha . FLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , it 's not a good sign . But what they say is that they do n't want to fight us . RICK ( To Mr. Wilson . ) They must 've heard we were here . DANIEL BOONE They want to set the Ohio River as a boundary . South of the Ohio would be Indian land . North would be white man 's land . SQUIRE And if we sign this treaty , they 'll go home ? DANIEL BOONE And we 'll go home . That 's right . Alive . RUSSELL And what else do we have to sign ? DANIEL BOONE An oath of loyalty to King George . RUSSELL I knew it . p. 90 SQUIRE You 're already a subject of King George just by virtue of bein ' born in Virginia , Russell . RUSSELL I wo n't sign . I wo n't . Virginia is at war with the British . SQUIRE We have to sign it . It does n't matter what it says . That or be slaughtered . RUSSELL I told every one of you what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . MR . WILSON ( To Rick . ) I worked for a guy like him once . DANIEL BOONE I figure we should , you know , take a vote on it , get some sleep , and then , if everybody is agreeable , in the morning , eighteen of us will meet eighteen of them under the sycamore at dawn and sign the treaty . RUSSELL And then they 'll kill us . Its a trick . DANIEL BOONE No , I know it 's a trick . But we 'll have a pretty good idea by then what they plan to do . RUSSELL And just where are we gon na get an idea like that ? DANIEL BOONE Flo and Hilly are spendin ' the night in their camp . FLO We are not . I told you that out there . DANIEL BOONE Blackfish has the lodge all fixed up , Flo . Besides , it 's just too good an opportunity to pass up . You 'll spend the night spyin ' out the situation , and just before dawn , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . p. 91 FLO I can tell you right now what 's going on , in case you 've forgotten . That 's a war chant , they 're singing . DANIEL BOONE No , I remember . So at least we know they wo n't start anything till morning . That damn song goes on forever . FLO And what if this is a trick , too ? What if all Blackfish wants is a couple of hostages to bargain with tomorrow . DANIEL BOONE He does n't . He likes Hilly , here . He 's just trying to help him out with you . Besides , you know how he likes weddings . ( Flo walks away a little . ) DANIEL BOONE So , now . Like Russell says we have to assume that the attack will start right after we sign the treaty . So between now and then , I want every gun oiled , every knife sharpened , and buckets of water placed every five feet along the palisade . ( Squire , Rick , Mr. Wilson , and Jemima all leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIEL BOONE Every man 's gon na have a bandage or somethin ' he can use for a bandage in his pocket or somewhere . And I want a list drawn up of who 's reloading who 's gun so when we get out there in the morning , everybody 's gon na be in position . ( Russell has remained behind , standing between Flo and Hilly . Now , he regards Hilly with suspicion. ) p. 92 RUSSELL You wo n't really be married , you know . FLO ( Genuinely to Russell . ) Thanks . ( Russell exits and Hilly looks at Flo . She turns away from him . ) HILLY This lodge business was n't my idea , Florence , you know that . The only reason I even fought with Boone was to buy us some time . That , and I did n't want him takin ' you away without a fight . But FLO But since you won , and since we 're back here in the wilderness , you 'll just act as wild as all the rest of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girl . " HILLY No , Florence . That 's what I was trying to say , If I could finish my sentence please . I did n't win . Boone did . FLO What do you mean ? HILLY I mean , he won the fight . I lost . FLO You mean he lied to me ? HILLY And he wanted some spies in their camp overnight , so he thought up this lodge thing . ( A pause . ) But I 'm not going to force you to spend the night with me . If you 'd rather just go get a burger or something , let 's go . FLO No . He 's right . Somebody should be out there . p. 93 HILLY So should I go get your stuff ? FLO I do n't have any stuff to get . But if you lay one finger on me out there , I 'll kill you . HILLY Fair enough . So are you ready now ? FLO I 'm ready . ( As the sound of drumming increases , they approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO THE TEEPEE HILLY The only thing I 'm worried about is what happens if we step inside this teepee and wind up back in the museum ? FLO That would suit you just fine , I bet . HILLY How does it work anyway ? Me and Wilson did n't have to say any magic words or anything . We did n't do anything except step inside . And you did n't either , I bet . So how did we get here ? ( An owl hoots in the distance . ) FLO ( Suddenly very tried . ) I do n't know , really . The first night I did it , I was just standing there in the museum feeling like there was nobody in the whole world I wanted to see . Nobody I wanted to call . And nobody I wanted to call me . HILLY Because you already knew what they were going to say ? FLO More like we 'd had our chance , you know , and we blew it . Like we 'd already decided it was n't going to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just easier to give up . Nobody even blames you for giving up anymore . It 's like being in love is something people used to do . When they had more time . p. 94 HILLY So you said , the hell with that . I 'm in love with Daniel Boone . FLO I did . I did n't even care if it was crazy . Suddenly , I knew exactly what to do , break all my dates , stop seeing people I did n't care about , and just love Daniel Boone . Then I picked up my broom and walked into the teepee to sweep it out , and here I was . I mean , there he was . Standing right in front of me . HILLY That 's how I felt , too . FLO You did ? HILLY About you . Not here though . Back there . At the museum . I 'd known for a long time who I was looking for , and all of a sudden . There you were . As soon as I saw you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FLO How did you know that ? HILLY ( A moment . ) You 're a believer . Florence . ( A moment . ) A man needs a woman like that . ( The sounds of the war chant get louder . ) FLO I hate that sound . I hate it . HILLY ( He holds the flap of the teepee open . ) It 's O.K. We 'll be O.K. FLO You go on in . I 'm just going to walk around a little out here . See if I can learn anything . p. 95 HILLY Do you want me to come with you ? FLO I want to know why you 're not scared by any of this . HILLY I 've been in situations a lot tougher than this . FLO Back there , you mean . HILLY Sure I have . Everything is harder back there . FLO It 's O.K. Blackfish is watching us . You go on inside . I 'll be back in a little bit . ( Hilly steps inside the teepee , as Flo walks away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flo walks away and Hilly enters the teepee . ) INSIDE THE FORT Boone is cleaning his rifle and talking with Jemima . DANIEL BOONE I know somethin ' is eatin ' at you . Jemima . You might as well tell me what it is . JEMIMA I think Flo is an Indian . I think she 's your Indian wife . ( Her anger rising . ) I think you brought your Indian wife back inside this fort with you , like nobody would even notice . What if mother had still been here ? DANIEL BOONE She might be an Indian . I do n't know . I do n't have any idea who Flo is . She told me she was married to a trapper and she got tired of him always smellin ' of dried blood and wet fur and run off . p. 96 JEMIMA Well , she told me the Indians killed her man and her child . DANIEL BOONE No , I told you that to keep you from thinking she was my Indian wife . JEMIMA ( Furious . ) Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Looks to me like those times are all gone . JEMIMA Are you gon na ask me not to tell mother about this ? DANIEL BOONE You 're a grown woman now , Jemima . What you tell your mother is between you and her . ( Jemima softens considerably toward him . ) JEMIMA Are we going to die tomorrow ? ( And Boone hugs her , suddenly seeming like an ordinary good Dad . ) DANIEL BOONE No we are not . If we made it this far we 'll probably live forever . ( Flo approaches . Jemima clings to Boone for a moment . ) DANIEL BOONE Florence , what are you doin ' here ? FLO I wanted to tell you what I heard . JEMIMA I 'll be inside , Daddy . ( Jemima leaves and Flo watches her go. ) p. 97 FLO Is she all right ? DANIEL BOONE She 's just scared , that 's all . How 's the enemy doing ? FLO Well , Blackfish wants to go home , but Moluntha and the British feel more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on back out there now , and I 'll see you in the morning . FLO I'muhnot going to be here in the morning . I 'm going to walk on down the path , I think . ( He takes a moment . ) DANIEL BOONE Gon na miss all the excitement if you leave now . FLO I ca n't shoot worth a damn . You know that . DANIEL BOONE You 're runnin ' from that man out there . Are n't you . FLO What if I am ? You 've done it enough . DANIEL BOONE Yes I have . So I can tell you right now , it wo n't work , Flo . Rebecca done the same thing to me , got it into her mind that I was hers . You 'll never get away from him , and you would n't be happy if you did . Best thing for you to do is give up and grab a hold . FLO I ca n't . I hardly know him . DANIEL BOONE How much do you have to know ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Then he fought me for you . Not a lot of men would do that . Give him a chance . ( Flo does n't answer. ) p. 98 DANIEL BOONE I mean , how 're you supposed to know what you think , standin ' around here waitin ' to get shot ? Maybe if you just went back out there and spent one night with the man , you 'd feel different about it . FLO Never . DANIEL BOONE People are n't like the country , Flo . You and me , we can walk away from all the fine places we 've ever seen cause we know there 's always gon na be a nicer place further on . But you walk away from a man like this , and chances are , you 'll never see his like again . FLO It 's not just him . It 's somethin ' about you , too . DANIEL BOONE No , I know . I 'm not gon na be much fun here for a while . FLO It 's not that . DANIEL BOONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what it is ? DANIEL BOONE No , I do n't think I do . FLO See . That 's it , exactly . DANIEL BOONE Well , I ca n't help that . It never did matter to me what other people did . Not that I would n't have an opinion about it . Cause I 've known some people done some things I did n't like at all ( A slight pause . ) But I would never try and stop ' em from doin ' it , whatever it was . Never . It would n't be right . p. 99 FLO Where are you going to go after this ? DANIEL BOONE Back home , I guess . It 's time I went back to civilization and tried to redeem myself somehow . FLO Did you ever write to Rebecca , to tell her you were alive ? DANIEL BOONE No , I do n't think I did . FLO Why not ? DANIEL BOONE I do n't know . Nothin ' out here to write on except the trees . And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment . ) You go on now . If you 're determined to lose this man , you 'd better get goin ' before he comes lookin ' for you . FLO Not one for a sentimental farewell , are you , Daniel Boone . DANIEL BOONE Nope . ( She just stands there a moment . And then suddenly , is very angry . ) DANIEL BOONE I 'll see you again sometime . FLO No . I do n't think you will . DANIEL BOONE Well . Maybe not . ( She turns away . ) DANIEL BOONE You watch yourself , now . ( Flo walks away from him and over to the palisade behind the cabin and turns on the lights and she is ) p. 100 BACK IN THE MUSEUM She takes off her shawl and whatever other articles of frontier clothing she is wearing and hangs them back up where they belong . She goes into the back room for a minute and comes out with her purse . She gets out a piece of paper and sits down to write a note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back room and stands and watches for a moment . HILLY You must think I am the dumbest man on earth . ( She turns around , startled . ) HILLY You did n't think I would know what you were doing ? " See you later , Hilly , I 'm just gon na go check on the Shawnee . " FLO I did check on the Shawnee . And then I told Daniel Boone what I saw . HILLY Give me a break . FLO That 's what he said . HILLY What Boone said ? FLO Yes , he did . He likes you . He said I should give you a chance . HILLY Well then ? FLO So . I 'm leaving you my phone number . ( He takes the paper from her . ) HILLY You are not . You 're telling me ( He reads ) " thanks for helping out at the fort , but I 'm not ready for a relationship right now . " What is it , Florence ? Am I goin ' too fast for you ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not either . You 've been prayin ' that somebody with some nerve would come along , and here I am . Now . What else is it ? Is it Linda ? Are my jeans too tight ? What ? FLO It 's not Linda . HILLY It 's my jeans . I knew it was my jeans . Well that 's just too bad . This is exactly what I like in jeans . Every pair I have is just like this . ( Suddenly , Rick and Mr. Wilson burst back into the room from the door of the cabin . They are covered in blood and dirt , and look like hell . ) RICK Jesus , God . What happened to you guys ? We thought they captured you . Boone made us search the whole camp just to make sure you did n't get scalped . HILLY You mean it 's all over ? RICK What a battle . They went out to sign the treaty , and one minute , they were all standin ' there , shakin ' hands and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and tomahawks flyin ' through the air MR . WILSON Nobody even knew who started it . RICK And then they all rushed back into the fort and it was two really tough days , I 'm here to tell you . Boone got hit , Squire got hit . Jemima got shot in the butt . p. 102 MR . WILSON Kids reloading rifles , and Indians climbing up the walls , and fire arrows landing on the roof , and all the time we 're trying to dig this tunnel RICK And tryin ' to stay awake and not go crazy from all the screamin ' and yellin ' . MR . WILSON And then it started to rain . RICK The one thing that could save our ass actually happened . Middle of the day , this mother of a storm hits . We thought , great , now we 're gon na fuckin ' drown here . MR . WILSON But when it was over , the Indians were gone . RICK Boone said Blackfish would see the rain as some kind of a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a couple of Indians pretty close up that last day . They were n't really into it . HILLY So Boone is all right . That 's good . RICK Except right as we were leavin ' , that little jerk Russell got Colonel Calloway to arrest Boone for treason . HILLY For treason ? That 's ridiculous . They 'd all have died if it had n't been for Boone . RICK So where were you guys ? HILLY I wanted to stay . But Florence was tryin ' to run away from me again . ( Rick and Mr. Wilson begin to take off their frontier clothes. ) p. 103 RICK I 'm glad I 'm not gon na have to explain to anybody what happened to these clothes . MR . WILSON They 're not too bad . I 'm very good at this sort of thing . We 'll let them dry overnight , then I 'll brush them off and put them back in the cases . No one will ever know . HILLY What finally happened to Boone ? Did he go to jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historian . ) No . He beat it . But just barely . And then he went to North Carolina to find Rebecca and the children , and it took him almost a year to get back to Kentucky . Where he fought the Indians some more , and they killed some more of his family . Until finally he got chased out of Kentucky because he 'd lost of all his land , and owed so much money . So he went with two of his sons to Missouri where he lived ' til he died . ( A pause . ) And then he stayed buried a while , until they dug him up and brought him back to Kentucky and buried him again . HILLY At least you think it was him . MR . WILSON That 's right . Well . I 'm going home . RICK Yeah . Me too . MR . WILSON Flo ? Are you still leaving us ? FLO I am. p. 104 MR . WILSON But am I ever going to see you again ? FLO I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na keep workin ' here , is n't he ? MR . WILSON He is , if I have anything to say about it . RICK So , you can just ask him . He 'll know where she is . MR . WILSON Well good . That 's what I 'll do . ( And Mr. Wilson and Rick walk out together like old army buddies , remembering the old stories . ) RICK So , did you see when that tomahawk landed in Boone 's neck ? MR . WILSON It was amazing . Like all he was worried about was where the next one was comin ' from . RICK Never saw anything like him . Standing next to Boone , I even had the feeling those two dead guys might pull through . MR . WILSON He could 've never done it without us , though . Two less men , and who knows what might have happened . ( They exit and Flo and Hilly are left alone . ) HILLY So . Where were we ? FLO Your jeans . p. 105 HILLY O.K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that long skirt . FLO ( Very tried . ) It 's not your jeans . It 's your whole attitude . You think you ought to have what you want just because you want it . HILLY It 's not just because I want it . It 's because I 'm willing to pay for it . FLO What do you mean , pay for it ? Are you buying me now ? What do I cost , Hilly ? HILLY I do n't know , Florence . Maybe everything I 've got . Maybe my job . Maybe my whole way of lookin ' at things . Maybe you 're gon na drive me crazy . Maybe Linda wo n't like you and I 'll lose this thing I have with her . Or maybe she 'll like you better than me , and I 'll feel like a jerk for bringing you in there . Or maybe it 'll be wonderful and I 'll love you to the end of the earth and you 'll have a heart attack and die . Or you 'll run off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die . I do n't know what you 'll cost me , Florence . And I do n't care . FLO But what do you know about me ? HILLY A lot . FLO Do you know I get depressed ? HILLY I figured you did . FLO Do you know I do n't want to work ? That all I really like to do is read ? Do you know that I hate my hair and spend a whole lot of time thinking about it ? What about my folks ? Would n't you like to know they 're not insane or something ? p. 106 HILLY Not unless they 're gon na live with us . FLO No . They 're not . HILLY O.K. , then . Marry me . Florence . Come andbe with me . Be whatever you want . You want to go invent electricity , or pan for gold , whatever it is , I 'm in . ( A moment . ) I love you . FLO No , I know . HILLY So what do you think ? FLO I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justheard what I said . ( Flo stands there a minute . ) HILLY You 're tired , are n't you . FLO I am . I think I 'm almost asleep . HILLY Tired is O.K. Sad is O.K. Running away from me again is not . O.K. ? ( Flo stands there a moment . ) FLO O.K. ( And he opens his arms to her , and slowly she walks into them and he holds her . And after a while , he speaks )
