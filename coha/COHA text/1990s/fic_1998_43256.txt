She knew she would not reach Cole Cole even before she started to walk , knew she could not do twenty-five kilometers in the sand with this pack . These new boots , she had learned on her last hike with Freyda , were a half size too short , had bruised her big toenails on the Towers of Paine in wind that tossed her body against rocks . Worse than the bruises was the raw blister that oozed into grit trapped beneath its loose moleskin plaster . She was determined to do a minimum of fifteen kilometers , but how far was that ? Eons dispersed into the sky 's opaque membrane-she had not worn her watch-and she had no idea how long she 'd been walking , or if darkness would strand her on this wild beach overnight . <p> Just a few days ago , she was camped in a filthy trekker 's refugio , still stuck with Freyda , hundreds of miles south . There , far from the blue ice leaves of the unattainable Gray Glacier , a thin French guide had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in a meaningless journey , he had advised her to go to the Free Zone , buy a cheap mochila , then take the ferry to this insular island from Puerto Montt . The line penciled from a dot he had labeled " Cucao " ran up her notebook to " Cole Cole , " representing , she 'd imagined , a short uphill hike . He had said six kilometers , she was fairly certain , not six hours ; but seis horas caminando , six hours walking , was what all the locals , including Pedro , and the bored guard at the CONAF kiosk , had told her , their arms flung indifferently north . <p> She 'd informed the French guide that she had left her own knapsack at home because she was traveling with Freyda , who 'd once ruptured disks heaving sacks in Africa , and could n't carry ten pounds , much less a pack . He 'd stared at her acutely , as if to imply that this , as well as other shortfalls , could still be remedied . " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five kilos he said , his voice private , intense , like the muffled birdcall of an Andean flute . He pointed to the Japanese woman he had guided on a ten-day tour of The Circuit , cheerfully inhaling a bowl of steaming four-grain porridge . " She is carrying thirty-five kilos , and she is fifty-four years old , " he exclaimed , italicizing fifty-four . How old does he think I am ? she had wondered hopefully . Despite Freyda 's compliment about her " good aging genes , " she no longer deceived herself about looking younger . After that , the apotheosis of Cole Cole , " next time , " and what could still be changed was a secret that she shared with him , this guru of the International Female Mid-Life Crisis , whoever he was . ( He revealed only that he 'd come to visit this country and stayed forever . ) <p> " Good luck , " he whispered as Freyda dumped down the stairs . Even her footsteps managed to sound pissed . She wore a pancaked safari hat , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stuck to her body like a wet plastic bag and made her look fat . Her dry , lipstick-less mouth was ratcheted into an upside-down Y by her anger ( about what ? ) . She would ferret out a minor injustice-a different exchange rate than the teller had said-and snap like raw electricity from a cut wire in places like banks . Freyda had asked the French guide if he would donate some of his boiled water for tea , pressing her palms into a praying formation , singsonging , " Oh thank you thank you , " before he agreed . She hated watching her old friend , not fat , but thicker , almost humped , trying to look cute to get a young guy to take care of her . Perhaps Freyda was the same as she had always been-they had n't seen each other for a couple of years-and it was she who had changed , living with Jack in the unfinished cabin so far from Manhattan . " He 's pretty ! " Freyda whispered about the French guide , honing his Swiss Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , remember what's-his-face in Ecuador ? " <p> She instantly recalled ( although she 'd just as soon not ) an image of a slender , long-haired boy with skin the color of wet Bentonite , framed by a ragged stone archway-of what ? A ruined convent ? She could n't dredge up his name , it had been twenty years , but oddly the name of the German guy that Freyda had met in Colombia came back . ( Franz . He 'd never joined her in Cuzco as he 'd promised he would . ) That was the summer she and Freyda had hooked up on a third-class bus to Latacunga , two solitary women adventurers , never married , and discovered that they both lived alone in Lower Manhattan , free spirits , more or less , who traveled abroad whenever they could . In Latacunga , they had bought a pile of sugary pastries heaped in baskets at a market bakery , and eaten them all as they obsessed about love , or , in their cases , lack of it . <p> This was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a celebration of a twenty-year friendship forged in wanderlust , a difficult one-they were too much alike , bossy , controlling-but after the scene over the penguins she had been positive that the trip would n't work . She should never have come to this country with Freyda , ditching Jack on New Year 's Eve , a mistake . Freyda had argued that her office closed for the holidays on December 23 , why should she cut her vacation short by a week ? She had acquiesced , changed her flight to the day after Christmas , succumbing to the memory of a no-strings attached freedom , when she owed men nothing but desire , not to Freyda 's self-centered demands , she thought . <p> The penguins had turned their relationship tense ; but they agreed to be polite , instead of arguing nonstop , to continue to Torres del Paine National Park together , and see how it went . At the garbage-strewn refugio , infested with mice , without a shower or electric lights , they learned that the boat that crossed Lake Esmeralda to Gray Glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freyda 's oversized suitcase mounted on wheels , they were unable to go anywhere without public transportation , or at least a horse , and horses cost fifty dollars a day in the National Park . Instead , they resolved to store the suitcase , sufficiently massive to qualify as " trunk , " and her own aqua duffel in the Visitors ' Center , bungee-cord the two-man Tadpole to her medium-sized daypack , cram it with food , strap their sleeping bags to their belts , and hike to the Gray Glacier ; but then , a chaotic Patagonian wind had blown up . <p> The thin French guide had taken her aside , intoned in his lyrical voice , " You can not walk there with your face in this wind without a good pack . " He 'd glanced at Freyda , unpinning her faded underwear from the portable clothesline she 'd strung over the dirty foam mattress and stuffing it into her king-sized valise . He ought to know , she thought ; his T-shirt , baring his sinuous vine arms to the chill , revealed tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , who could say what might have happened with him , but looking good for your age , she understood , was not the same as looking good to young men . Jack had worried that she might " take up " with someone-touchingly , he saw her as universally attractive . She 'd located a Lacdel phone booth on New Year 's Day and called him ; he was n't at home at seven a.m. ; ominous , as the cabin must have been snowed in . <p> While Freyda futzed with her embarrassing laundry , the Japanese hiker pointed to the black and yellow striped suitcase , flung open on the refugio floor , revealing its complex stuffing of plastic bags , a heavy , supportive car seat , and a portable umbrella with broken ribs . She shouted , " You go with all that ? , " grabbed her big round stomach , and laughed . <p> The sea at Cucao belonged to an age before the entire world was discovered . Its waves gathered energy from the transparent moon 's ghost and blasted forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The relentless curls of white foam that dissipated without changing velocity or shape were making her dizzy , or maybe the Korean-made mochila , not as comfortable as her backpack at home , was aggravating nerves in her neck . This iconic dream of a beach , unmarred by resort hotels , thinned to a shiny vibrating tine then vanished . There would be no way to capture its endlessness in a photograph , but she could imagine eulogizing its unspoiled beauty to her academic colleagues when they asked , without interest , " How was your trip ? " or to Freyda , who might not have come to this island after their Air Passes took them in different directions . <p> Like a petulant child , Freyda had refused to say where she was going , or even goodbye , after she lost the coin toss for the laminated map of the south . The next day they 'd bumped into one another in an ecclesiastic museum featuring dusty stuffed albatrosses ; Freyda was coughing with a severe bronchial cold , holed up in Casa Mochiladero , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer they 'd met , sharing a room with six adolescent male rock climbers , all smoking cigarettes and dope . She 'd felt sorry for her old friend then , trapped in her miserly concept of youth , despite a decent job , an inheritance . Getting to Cole Cole would prove she 'd had a moral imperative to jettison Freyda 's moving van of a suitcase , her neurotic fury , and cheapness , her dowager 's back , although this no longer seemed a good reason to plod so many kilometers in pain , agony , she had to admit . <p> In the end , Freyda had been the one to suggest that they separate . On their last hike up the steep trail with views of Cambrian granite dikes , she had said , " Let 's face it , even when we are n't battling over every little thing , this is n't good : " They had argued childishly about whose fault it was : You and your pronouncements ! Freyda exclaimed , and she had retorted , You 're always projecting anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not doing that . Then Freyda said , sensibly , that if they did n't stop this , they really would n't be speaking to each other by the end of the hike . They 'd agreed never to travel together again , but to keep in touch . At the top of the boulder cascade , where the wind flattened the air into dust-laden sheets that flapped through the gorge , moving the surface of the diaphanous lake that roared beneath the towers ' oblique fingers of rock , their resentment did dissipate . Yet as she descended the rough path , she secretly planned to take the French guide 's advice , buy the Korean mochila , and backpack to Cole Cole , transforming the failed reunion into an important adventure she could one day tell Freyda about . <p> Twenty-five kilometers in one day was pushing it , though , she should have known that . Seis horas ? More like six years , she thought ironically . She wished she 'd taken a chance on the weather and left the tent in the residencia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cole Cole , as the French guide had said , but none of the trekkers coming from there had seen it . To be on the safe side , she had fastened the Tadpole plus metal stakes , seven and a half pounds , under the straps on the front of the pack instead of sticking them under the flap on the top where she had stowed the heavy water bottles . As a result , the tent was dragging her backwards like a claw hooked into the tendon between her shoulder and neck . There was no point trying to repack unless she dumped most of the water and drank from the river at Cole Cole , which , according to Pedro , was clean and safe . <p> The joints in her hips were beginning to ache . Her powers of concentration should have enabled her to blot the tavernas , black horse flies the size of newborn mice , if not the pain , from her consciousness . These whining insects , materializing in the late morning heat , pursued her denim shirt to cool breezes emitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the fleas in the infested hotel on the beach in Ecuador the summer they 'd met . She had refused to give the poor Indian girl who gently bathed the infected bites the blue bandanna she 'd begged for . I need it , Freyda kept insisting . At the time she 'd believed that her new traveling companion 's refusal to bestow a trivial gift signified more than pure selfishness ; the girl 's maternal tenderness was pressing warped psychic buttons , perhaps . Oh , just give it to her , she 'd said . You can buy another in New York for twenty-five cents . The scene over the penguins had reminded her of that long-ago incident ; Freyda , the self-acclaimed world traveler , had always viewed the citizens of foreign countries as servants . <p> She had met the Ecuadorian boy at a drunken carnival in that town on the coast . Within minutes , it seemed , they were fucking on the beach . Twenty years later , the memory of the sex eluded her , but the cans and bottles beneath their bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness , the music strained through the Pacific 's lapping , came back with visceral clarity , as if her pain on the beach she was now on recalled them . She could n't remember speaking Spanish with him . Surely they spoke ? That 's right , he had been an exchange student in Canada and learned some English . <p> When she 'd returned to the hotel , Freyda was lying on the cold tile floor , thin , wiry curls propped up on a pillow , playing Bach on a recorder , her face still inflamed from the bites ; her back had collapsed again , she said with stoic cheer ; she hoped she 'd still be able to trek to Macchu Picchu with Franz . That 's really wild ! Freyda had exclaimed with admiring wonder when she told her about the boy on the beach . Freyda could always give back the excitement of semi-crazed trysts that she herself would too quickly forget . <p> Before they 'd flown down to Punta Arenas at the beginning of this trip , they had sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their backs , whirling dizzily to their selfimposed beat . " Catching up , " as Freyda called it , they had strayed to the risky subject of the future , growing older . Freyda complained about her poor circulation ; her legs had always been lumpy with purple varicose veins ; now they were worse . They do n't see your legs unless they 're in bed with you , she had said consolingly , aware , as the words left her mouth , that her own legs were all right . Freyda had rambled on , as she often did , about Hank , her favorite ex , dead of a brain tumor at forty-nine ; she imitated his buoyant Swahili greeting when they 'd traveled in Kenya decades ago , shortly before he went back to his wife . She continued on to the subject of that fat , crazy lawyer who 'd crashed at her place when he 'd come down to the city to fight for custody of an illegitimate son . As the loud gypsies danced , Freyda had said with a calm acceptance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think there will be any more men . Then she 'd exclaimed , with cheerfully exaggerated envy , I want a Jack ! This comment , intended to be flattering , had made her feel guilty , both for having the man her friend wanted and for abandoning him . <p> If she 'd known she would end up backpacking without Freyda , she 'd have brought her MSR water filter , her Whisper Lite stove , and light freeze-dried food . She would n't be schlepping four greasy milpoa , fresh tomatoes , six rolls , cheese , and two weighty cans of sardinas desmenuzados . Few provisions were available in Cucao because the dirt road to the small settlement had been half washed out . Even in dry weather the town was remote . The woman who ran the residencia where she 'd spent the night told her that until last year , when electricity arrived , there was no ice ; when one family slaughtered a sheep , it shared the meat with other families . There was still no television or hot running water ; Pedro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her , a deliberately neutral expression on his long , sour face , suggested that she take a guide-him-and a horse to Cole Cole . He must have seen the weakness she had hid from herself . Why had n't she hired him ? She had the money . <p> She stopped to rest-for the second time in half an hour-on a white driftwood log hurled out of the sea . Immediately the horse flies were on her , injecting venom into the back of her neck . Before she left the residencia this morning , she had raised the pack plus herself to a standing position by slipping her arms in the straps and crouching on all fours while bracing her hands on the chair next to the bed . I 'm not going to get there , she had thought . As she 'd trudged toward the wood-slatted suspension bridge , a back-lighted streamer of evaporating moisture laddered up along the pale sticks of a fence . Pedro 's Arabian horses wheeled , snorting , through moon-colored grass and ignited tendrils . Vines rubbed magenta flowers into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean beating drumrolls on its sliding skin . She followed the broad backs of two Mapuche women , mounted on mules , parading ahead . A small Indian man wearing a formal blue suit , vest , and fedora galloped by on a chestnut gelding , crying , Cole Cole ! Seis horas caminando ! enthusiastically to her . She had felt exhilarated then , glad to be attempting what she believed she should do , and for a little while , the pack had felt carryable . <p> A male figure emerged from the mica haze of the primordial beach . The young man joined her on the log ; his dark eyes shy , yet intently inquiring , followed her finger as it attempted to trace the route on the lousy CONAF map . He said , casually , that he had not arrived to Cole Cole ; it was difficil to walk in the sand with boots . ( His were not Goretex , but black leather military castoffs . ) He had camped by the lake instead . She gestured toward a faraway point , extending rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked him . No , he said , squinting at the map ; the place where the trail left the beach was not there , but mas lejos , beyond that ; you must cross two rivers , using the bridges if you did not miss them , climb a small mountain , thick with jungle ; the path was easy to lose because it was not marked . They talked for a while ; he was a student from a small town near Temuco . <p> Solita ? Alone ? he questioned , like everyone else from this country . She had developed a snappy retort , Si , como no ? ( Yeah , why not ? ) She did n't use it with him ( his brown eyes , shining with the self-involved sincerity of the idealistic young , deterred her ) , or mention that she had started the trip with a friend . People from this country reacted negatively , almost with fear , to the revelation that she had n't gotten along with her traveling companion ; perhaps in Spanish she was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , a sophisticated woman from the capitol had told her . ) Now she replied , " Yes , solitude is better sometimes . " The student nodded doubtfully ; he was alone , too , but he was not a middle-aged female American tourist . <p> She looked at the sun , said adios , and struggled to her feet , like a camel unfolding its legs to leverage a burden attached to its hump . Her ankles were killing her . The student watched her go worriedly . As she felt herself disappearing down the beach 's platinum funnel , she realized that instead of hurrying on to a place that she would n't get to , she could have stayed on the log and talked to him . She could have asked about Temuco , the birthplace of Pablo Neruda . <p> The Ecuadorian boy had the same long , dark hair , scraped back in a ponytail , receptive eyes , and wet clay skin as the student did . She remembered his last name-Aguilar , or was it AguilarLanza ? - but not his first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Quito , leaving Freyda still waiting for that German shit . The boy had managed to meet her at the airport ( she had n't told him the time of her flight ) , and carried her duffel to a cheap hotel . That night he led her through a cobblestoned back street to an unsigned rooming house that must have been a brothel where unmarried couples also went to have sex . After twenty years she could picture the bed , a narrow cot , with one thin , gray sheet that bunched up to reveal a blood-stained green mattress . Flimsy partitions concealed the owner of a continual wet cough . Doors banged all night . He had gasped , Dios , with grateful amazement ; then translated , " My Got , " knowing she spoke enough Spanish to understand God . She remembered telling Freyda the story in the Cafe Dante when they got together for cappuccino in New York . Do you think you 'll ever hear from him ? her friend had asked , interpreting , as she always would , any male-female encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never imagined she would hear from him , although she had given him her address , watched him read it , sounding out the English words with careful attention , button the paper into his breast pocket , then happily pat the place where it was . <p> All morning she had encountered other hikers , mostly young couples , returning to Cucao from Cole Cole . When the hot sun dried the flare of her shadow , she saw two men and a woman , walking briskly , as if their cumbersome packs were loaded with bubble wrap . " It was beautiful there , all right , " one of the men , an American , told her . " Great views of the bay . .. I have no complaints except for the flies . " The way to drive them all off for a nanosecond , he said , was to injure one , badly , by bashing it with your hat . He took off his hat , and swiped a buzzing taverna to demonstrate , revealing faded red hair and a lined , freckled forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew , the type she was-an aging hippie , like himself-hiking alone with a useless pink backpack . She told him she was headed to Cole Cole . . . probably would n't get there , though ; this Korean pack was junk ; she should never have put two liters of water in it . She 'd heard you could take water out of the river , but she was a coward . . . The trekkers at Torres Del Paine were using the trail for a bathroom , and that really scared her . <p> " My Argentinean friends here will drink anything , " the sunburned man said , gesturing toward the silent couple that gazed at her curiously , " but the water in that river did n't look too good . The drought has made it awfully muddy . You were supposed to drink on one side of the bridge and bathe downstream on the other . I let it settle , then boiled it . " <p> " See , and I do n't have a stove . " <p> He stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're alone ? " <p> " Yeah . " She explained that she 'd started the trip with a woman friend , but it had n't worked out . . . This guy , a hip American , would understand what she had n't said ; then , inexplicably , she felt as if she were betraying Freyda . <p> " She left you in the lurch , huh , " the American stated . He looked at his watch , noted that they had been walking for four hours . " You could still get to Cole Cole before dark . What time does the sun set ? Ten , ten-thirty ? " <p> " Actually , I 'm considering bagging it . Cole Cole ca n't be much better than this ; " she said , circling her head to encompass the here and now , the Zen of the glittering , undiscovered beach . The American looked at her sorrowfully , and she saw herself through his blue eyes , nested in crow 's feet , a crazed hag , limping alone , face clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough food , water , or the right equipment for a four-day trip into the heart of a jungle . " I might camp at the lake instead , " she said , remembering that the student from Temuco had mentioned one . " Lago Cucao . It 's about half a mile back , inland a ways . You already passed it , " the American informed her . <p> Had Freyda gotten rid of her ? Perhaps , she thought , as she continued on . ( She had n't wanted to give up , turn around , in front of an audience . ) She had tried to control her irritation , to be kind , to comprehend that her furious friend must be going through a dark night of the soul she had n't confided . After the absurd scene over the penguins , she had lost it , though ; rage dredged her voice in a whisper , Ugly American ! You made a fool out of yourself and me ! , and immediately regretted the cruel word ugly . That night , alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jack , a letter , it turned out , he never received . <p> She reached the point after circumnavigating an inlet the breadth of a dead sea that refused to part . The sand sucked her blistered feet into it . Sobbing feebly , she threw down her pack , picked it up again , howling . She heard her cry waver through the loud air like an imaginary spear and vanish . Now she sat , weary , her shoulder knotted in a painful spasm , on a baklava of shale . Thick ropes of a rubbery orange seaweed plopped over the chewed rocks where hand-shaped fronds gestured , oblivious to the absence of soil . Birds she could n't name , wings blackened by the late sun into charred silhouettes , cruised overhead . The oasis 's flowing tide streams pooled into clear eyes of water on scalloped white shells , a miniature world of extravagant beauty , offering her a truth her focus on Cole Cole , a destination some French guide had inscribed in her notebook , might have caused her to miss . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this ? She knew she lied to console herself , not for failing to reach the goal , but for not having the strength . <p> She took off her boots and peeled away the waterlogged moleskin . The broken blister had been bleached by wet , wool socks to the color of drowned flesh . Rene . The Ecuadorian boy 's name was Rene . When he 'd walked her back to her cheap hotel the following morning , the friendly maid , ironing sheets , had projected a scorn she could feel brushing her face like a spider 's web . Then the maid had looked the other way , pointedly , as if she were shunning a prostitute . ( That she had not told Freyda about . ) A few months later the boy had written a barely literate letter , Hello , Babe ! I am here thinking to you , and included a flash-bleached photograph of himself , lounging on a sunken blue sofa , wearing an unbuttoned candy pink shirt . I want to come for to visit you in United States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prosperous country ; from the perspective of her real life in Manhattan , she realized that she 'd known this from the start . After that , she had avoided thoughts of their depraved rutting , two dogs on a beach , although only Freyda knew about it and had never judged her . Now she wondered if she had damaged Rene by altering the path of his expectations while forgetting his name . <p> As she soaked her feet in the opal stream , the ancient Mapuche she 'd greeted at the beginning of the journey , still wearing a formal blue suit , galloped up on his horse , leaped off , and cast a homemade reel into the surf . " Corvina ! " he exclaimed gaily . She watched him with dull amazement ; he was a hundred years old , yet his eyes , blinded by the cooked egg whites of cataracts , did not stop him from riding , fishing , recognizing her . Cole Cole ? he shouted again , confident that she was still headed to the same place as the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remounted he threw his arm , like a lariat , north . Seis horas caminando , he cried , and rode off smartly , spurring his steed into the dense , drought-bleached jungle . <p> Could she be no closer to Cole Cole than she was this morning when she set out ? Had she walked all day and gotten nowhere ? It was possible . She had never seen the lake , the rivers , or the bridges that were supposed to cross them . She stood up , disoriented . She wanted to call , " Wait ! Where is the path ? , " Donde esta el sendero ? , but the monotone thud of the sea , her desolation , swallowed the words before she could speak . <p> She sat on the point , gazing into the tide pool 's eons of layered white shells until the hard pink sun expanded , fraying at the edges , and dropped . When she arose she dumped most of the water and turned back to look for the lake . <p> An animal will steal her food that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campground near Lago Cucao , will open her mouth wide , laughing , and exclaim , Si ! Perros ! O gato cholo ! Before she leaves this country , she will ford a rain-swollen river , risking hypothermia , to get to El Encanto , because she never made it to Cole Cole . There she will eat the sardinas desmenuzados in a water-logged rowboat as multiple waterfalls steam down boulders . On the Esplanade in Puerto Montt she will meet a gypsy woman , del Norte , maybe a thief , who knots the hundred pesos she gives her in the ruffled hem of her long , flowered skirt , saying , " Because you have given me this coin , I will answer one question . " After she asks it , the gypsy will reply , flat pale eyes gazing past her face to the port , " You will suffer much sorrow and disappointment in this life . " Forest fires will burn underground on the insular island of Chiloe , where , in the time of Darwin , torrents of rain fell . Blue glaciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Freyda had seen that for themselves . Home in the unfinished cabin , she will feel confused and lost , although Jack will be there , resentful about New Year 's Eve , but glad she is back . She will tell him the news her lost letter contained : Freyda castigated the driver from the agency they 'd booked to take them to the Pinginera because he was late . It is New Year 's Eve ; I meant no harm . " Freyda , will you shut up ! " she injected . Freyda had cursed her then , with a hatred so venomous , so long-stifled , so Biblically intense that she had immediately repressed the exact words her friend said . You know this woman long ? " She ca n't tolerate schedule changes , " she 'd apologized to the driver , who understood English , wondering why she was defending this selfish crone , a stranger she barely recognized . Young , coarsely handsome , the driver recited a proverb : It is better to go alone than badly accompanied . He offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled to the end of the earth , to an unfrozen bay , where the ancient tuxedoed birds twirled stunted wings and poked their heads out of burrowed nests . When she tells the story of her lonely , dissatisfying , final adventure , as she often does , the scene over a penguin tour seems insignificant , a weak denouement , a poor reason to hike twentyfive kilometers in pain , to abandon an old friend . She will realize she had known she would not get to Cole Cole even before she started to walk . Why did Freyda carry a broken umbrella all the way from New York ? <p>
