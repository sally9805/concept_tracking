In a fog-choked , dreamscapey San Francisco , refugees from the author 's novels Idoru and Virtual Light navigate the blurry boundary between terrestrial reality and cyberspace , meeting a new raft of 21st century weirdos as an ill-defined societal apocalypse nears . The ferociously talented Gibson ( Neuromancer ) delivers his signature melange of techno-pop splendor and postindustrial squalor , but this time his teasing , multicharacter narrative leads only to an irritating head scratcher of a conclusion . Genre freaks : this appears to complete the trilogy . Connoisseurs : just reread Neal Stephenson . <P>  --  By Michael Krantz
