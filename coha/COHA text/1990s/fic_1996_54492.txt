In the last year . Dean Wesley Smith has sold ten novels . Spiderman : Carnage in New York from Ace/Boulevard is one of the first to appear in print . <p> He has also sold a large number of short stories . His most recent for F &SF,; " Jukebox Gifts " ( January , 1995 ) , made the preliminary Nebula ballot . <p> He returns with a tender tale of love abandoned , but not forgotten . <p> OVER THE LONG YEARS I HAD grown used to the sweet smell of blood , to the sharp taste of disgust , to the wide-eyed look of lust . But the tight , small room of the nursing home covered me in new sensations like a mad mother covering her sleeping young child tenderly with a blanket before pressing a pillow hard over the face . <p> I eased the heavy door closed and stood silently for a moments , my clutch purse tight against my chest . One hospital bed , a small metal dresser , and an aluminum walker were all the furniture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silently moved to stand in the beam of silver moonlight cutting the night . I wanted more than anything else to run . But I calmed myself , took a deep breath , and worked to pull in and study my surroundings as I would on any night on any city street . <p> As with all of the cesspools of humanity the smell was the most overwhelming detail . The odor of human rot filled the building and the room , not so much different from a dead animal beside the road on a hot summer 's day . Death and nature doing their work . But in this building in this small room , the natural work was disguised by layer after layer of biting poison antiseptic . I suppose it was meant to clean the smell of death away so as not to disturb the sensitive living who visited from the fresh air outside . But instead of clearing , the two smells combined to form a thick aroma that filled my mouth with disgust . <p> I blocked the smell and focused my attention on the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet Slowboat Man , my husband once , lay under the white sheet of the room 's only bed . His frame shrunken from the robust , healthy man I remembered from so many short years ago . He smelled of piss and decay . His face , rough with old skin and white whiskers , seemed to fight an enemy unseen on the battleground of this tiny room . He jerked , then moaned softly , his labored breathing working to pull enough air to get to the next breath . <p> I moved to him , my ex-husband , my Slowboat Man , and lightly brushed his wrinkled forehead to ease his sleep . I used to do that as we lay together in our featherbed . I would need him to sleep so that I could go out and feed on the blood of others . He never awoke while I was gone , not once in the twenty years we were together . <p> Or at least he never told me he had . <p> I had never asked . <p> I was hunting the night we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise and good cheer around the country . The war was won , the evil vanquished , and the living bathed in the feeling of a wonderful future . I had spent the last thirty years before and during the war in St. Louis , but my friends had aged , as always happened , and it was becoming too hard to answer the questions and the looks . I had moved on many times in the past and I would continue to do so many times in the future . It was my curse for making mortal friends and enjoying the pleasures of the mortal world . <p> I pleaded to my friends in St. Louis a sick mother in a far away city and booked passage under another name on an old-fashioned Mississippi riverboat named Joe Henry . I had loved the boats when they were working the river the first time and now again loved them as they came back again for the tourists and gambling . <p> For the first few days I stayed mostly to my small cabin , sleeping on the small bed during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day hunger finally drove me into the narrow hallways and lighted party rooms of the huge riverboat . <p> Many soldiers and sailors filled the boat , most still in uniform and most with woman of their own age holding onto their arms and laughing at their every word . The boat literally reeked of health and good cheer and I remember that smell drove my hunger . <p> I supposed events could have turned another way and I might have met Johnny before feeding . But almost immediately upon leaving my cabin I had gotten lucky and found a young sailor standing alone on the lower deck . <p> I walked up to the rail and pretended to stare out over the black waters of the river and the lights beyond . The air felt alive , full of humidity and insects , thick air that carried the young sailor 's scent clearly to me . <p> He moved closer and struck up a conversation . After a minute I stroked his arm , building his lust and desire while at the same time blocking his mind of my image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the mattress on my bed in my cabin and even though he kept a straight face the smell of sexual lust almost choked me . <p> Within two minutes he was asleep on my bed and I was feeding drinking light to not hurt him , but getting enough of his blood to fill my immediate hunger . <p> After I finished I brushed over the marks on his neck with a lick so that no sign would show and then cleaned myself up while letting him rest . Then I roused him just enough to walk him up a few decks , where I slipped away , happy that I might repeat the same act numbers of times during this voyage . It was an intoxicating time and I felt better than I had ever remembered feeling in years . <p> I decided that an after-dinner stroll along the moonlit deck would be nice before returning to my cabin . I moved slowly , drinking in the warmth of the night air , listening to the churning of the paddle wheel , feeling the boat slice through the muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail about mid-ship , smoking a pipe . Under the silver moon his Navy officer 's white uniform seemed to glow with a light of its own . I started to pass him and realized that I needed to stop , to speak to him , to let him hold me . <p> He affected me as I imagined I affected my prey when I fed . I was drawn to him with such intensity that resisting did n't seem possible . <p> I hesitated and he glanced over at me and laughed , a soft laugh as if he could read my every thought , as if he knew that I wanted him with me that instant , without reason , without cause . He just laughed , not at me , but in merriment at the situation , at the delight , at the beauty of the night . <p> He laughed easily and for the next twenty years I would enjoy that laugh every day . <p> I turned and he was smiling a smile that I will always remember . I learned over the years that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkest place . He had a smile that many a night I would lose myself in while he told me story after story after story . I never tired of that smile and that first exposure to it melted my will . I would be his slave and never care as long as he kept smiling at me . <p> " Beautiful evening is n't it ? " he said , his voice solid and genuine , like his smile . <p> " Now it is , " I said . I had to catch my breath even after something that simple . <p> Again he laughed and made a motion that I should join him at the rail gazing out over the river and the trees and farmland beyond . <p> I did , and for twenty years , except to feed on others while he slept , I never left his side . <p> THE SMELL of the room pulled me from the past and back to my mission of the evening . I looked at his weathered , time-beaten form on the bed and felt sadness and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of his life , of not sharing that time with him , as I had regretted missing the years before I met him . But on both I had had no choice . Or I had felt I had had no choice . I might have been wrong , but it was the choice I had made . <p> Since the time I left him I had never found another to be my husband . Actually I never really tried , never really wanted to fill that huge hole in my chest that leaving him had caused . <p> But now he was dying and now I also had to move on , change cities and friends again . I had always felt regret with each move , yet the regret was controlled by the certainty that the decision was the only right one , that I would make new friends , find new lovers . But this time it was harder . Much harder . <p> I sat lightly on the side of his bed and he stirred , moaning softly . I again brushed his forehead , easing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more peaceful rest . It was the least I could do for him . He deserved so much more . <p> This time he moaned with contentment and that moan took me hack to those lovely nights on the Joe Henry , slowly making our way down the river , nestled in each other 's arms . We made love three , sometimes four times a day and spent the rest of the time talking and laughing and just being with each other , as if every moment was the most precious moment we had . <p> During those wonderful talks I had wanted to tell him of my true nature , but did n't . The very desire to tell him surprised me . In all the years it had not happened before . So I only told him of the twenty years in St. Louis , letting him think that was where I had been raised . As our years together went by that lie became as truth between us and he never questioned me on it . <p> He was born in San Francisco and wanted to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him I was alone in the world , as was the true case , just drifting and looking for a new home . He seemed to admire that about me . But he also knew I was free to move where he wanted . <p> I had so wanted him to know that . <p> The day before we were to dock in Vicksburg I mentioned to him that I wished the boat would slow down so that our time together would last . The days and nights since I met him had been truly magical , and in my life that was a very rare occurrence . <p> He had again laughed at my thought , but in a good way . Then he hugged me . " We will be together for a long time , " he had said , " but I will return in a moment . " <p> With that he had dressed and abruptly left the cabin , leaving me surrounded by his things and his wonderful life-odor . After a short time he returned , smiling , standing over me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish is granted , " he had said . " The boat has slowed . " <p> I did n't know how he had managed it , and never really asked what it had cost him . But somehow he had managed to delay the boat into Vicksburg by an extra day . A long wonderful extra day that turned into a wonderful marriage . <p> From that day forward I called him my Slowboat Man and he never seemed to tire of it . <p> " Beautiful evening is n't it ? " he said hoarsely from the bed beside me . His words yanked me from the past and back to the smell of death and antiseptic in the small nursing home room . Johnny was smiling up at me lightly , his sunken eyes still full of the light and the mischief that I had loved so much . <p> " It is now , " I said , stroking him , soothing him . <p> He started to laugh , but instead coughed and I soothed him with a touch again . <p> He blinked a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching my arm . " You are as beautiful as I remembered , " he said , his voice clearing as he used it , gaining more and more power . " I 've missed you . " <p> " I 've missed you , too , " I somehow managed to say . I could feel his weak grip on my arm . <p> He smiled and then his eyes closed . <p> I touched his forehead and again he was dozing . I sat on the bed beside him and thought back to that last time I had sat beside him on our marriage bed , almost thirty years earlier . <p> That last night , as with any other night I went out to feed , I had put him to sleep with a few strokes on the forehead and then stayed with him to make sure his sleep was deep . But that last night I had also packed a few things , very few , actually , because I had hoped to take very little of our life together to remind me of him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile , heard his laugh and his voice everywhere I went . <p> I had known for years that the day of leaving was coming . And many times over the years we were together I thought of telling him about my true nature . But I could never overcome the fear . I feared that if he knew he would hate me , fight me , even try to kill me . I feared that he would find a way to expose those of us like me in the city and around the country . But my biggest fear was that he would never be able to stand my youth as he aged . <p> I could not have stood the look of hate and disgust in his eyes . <p> At least that was what I told myself . As the years passed since I left him I came to believe that my fear had been a stupid one . But I never overcame that fear , at least not until now . <p> I know my leaving to him must have felt sudden and without reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I know he did n't truly understand . <p> But for me I had no choice . During the month before I left comments about my youth were suddenly everywhere . Johnny and our friends had aged . I had n't . I even caught Johnny staring at me when he thought I would n't notice . <p> Three nights before I left , one waitress asked him , while I was in the ladies room , what his daughter , meaning me , wanted for desert . He had laughed about it , but I could tell he did n't understand and was bothered . As he should have been . <p> The night I left , I found a book about vampires hidden in a pile of magazines from his office . A well-read book . <p> I could wait no longer and I knew then that I could never talk to him about it . I had to go that night and I did so , leaving only a note to him that said I would always love him . <p> I moved quickly , silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But less than a year later , no longer able to even fight the fight of keeping him out of my mind , I returned to San Francisco under a new name and began to watch him from afar . <p> As with me , he never remarried . Many nights he would walk the streets of the city alone , just smiling , almost content . I paced him , watching him , protecting him from others of my kind and from the mortal criminals . I imagined that he knew I was watching him . Pacing him . Walking with him . Protecting him . I pretended that knowing I was there made him happy . Many nights I even thought of actually showing myself to him , of holding him again . <p> But I never did . <p> I never had the courage . <p> He stirred under the nursing home sheet and I watched him as he awoke . He opened his eyes , saw me , and then smiled . " Good . I was hoping you were more than a dream . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming . " <p> He laughed and gripped my hand and I could feel the warmth flowing between us . I leaned down and kissed him on the cheek , his rough skin warm against my face . As I pulled back I could see a single tear in the corner of his right eye . But in both eyes the look was love . I was amazed . <p> And very glad . <p> I had feared he would hate me after I had left him without warning . I had feared that when I came to visit tonight he would ask the questions about my youth and how I had stayed so young , questions that I had always been so afraid to answer . I had feared most of all that he would send me away . <p> But he did n't . And the relief flooded through my every cell . Even after almost thirty years he still loved me . I wanted to shout it to the entire world . But instead I just sat there grinning at him . <p> In the hundreds of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seen a love so complete and total as his love for me . <p> It saddened me to think that in the centuries to come I might never find it again . <p> " I 'm glad you decided to come and say good-bye , " he said . " I was hoping you would . " <p> I gently touched his arm . " You know I wanted to when  --  " <p> He waved me quiet . " Do n't . You did what you had to do . " <p> My head was spinning and I wanted to ask him a thousand questions : How he knew ? What he knew ? <p> But instead I just sat beside him on the bed and stared at him . After a moment he laughed . <p> " Now say good-bye properly , " he said . " Then be on your way . I overheard the doctor telling one of the nurses that I might not make it through the night and I do n't want you here when I leave . Might not be a pretty sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had seen more death than he could ever imagine , but I did n't want to tell him that . <p> A long spell of coughing caught him and he half sat up in bed with the pain . I stroked his forehead and he calmed and worked to catch his breath . Alter a moment he said , " I loved it when you used to do that to me . Always thought it was one of your nicer gifts to me , even though I never understood just how or what you did . " <p> Again he laughed lightly at what must have been my shocked look . Even after all these years , even with very little force behind it , his laugh could still gladden my heart , make me smile , ease my worries . Again this time it took only a moment before I smiled and then laughed with him . <p> " Now be on your way , " he said . " The nurse will be here shortly and I have a long journey to make into the next world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually looking forward to it . You would too if you had an old body like this one . " <p> I nodded and stood . " Good-bye , my Slowboat Man . " I leaned down and kissed him solidly on his rough , chapped lips . <p> " Good-bye , my beautiful wife . " <p> He smiled at me one last time and I smiled back , as I always had . <p> Then I turned and headed for the door . I knew that I had to leave immediately , because if I did n't I never would . But this time he wanted me to go . I was n't running away . <p> As I pulled the handle open to the dimly lit hallway , he called out to me . " Beautiful ? " <p> I stopped and turned . <p> " I 'm sorry I could n't slow the boat down this time . " <p> " That 's all right , " I said , just loud enough for him to hear . " No matter how long or how short the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Slowboat Man . Sleep well . " <p> And as the door to his final room closed behind me I added to myself , " And thank you .
