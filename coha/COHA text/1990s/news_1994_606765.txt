<p> " THAT 'S A wig , " Carol whispered , with a subtle flick of her head toward the porter as we settled into our seats aboard the Murder Mystery Express that would take us to Atlantic City for an afternoon of gambling . <p> She was right . And that was n't the only thing about the porter that did n't seem like standard Amtrak issue . In addition to wearing a rug , he was dressed entirely in black , and although the train car was shadowy , he sported shades . When the man had first attracted my attention in Union Station , before I even knew he would be on our train , he had had on a silver lame tie , yet when he served us breakfast less than an hour later , the tie was gone , replaced by a turquoise necklace . V-e-r-r-r-y interesting . <p> " I 'm just the porter , " he insisted when passengers asked if he were one of the mystery players , and maybe that was the undisguised truth . Just the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind just such a false front of innocence . The murder victim had been Danny the Duke , a casino operator  --  emphasis on operator  --  who had been offed in Atlantic City a few weeks earlier . Apparently , a lot of people felt the Duke played the game of life with loaded dice , and they did n't take it kindly . <p> Marlena , the Duke 's old love connection , for one . The Duke had tossed her aside like a bad poker hand when a cigarette girl called Rosemary had come into the picture . Treatment like that might make a girl mad , even murderous . <p> Then there was light-fingered Larry Alto , the Duke 's casino manager . The Duke may have been fond of one-armed bandits , but he gave Larry the boot for skimming from the casino . " Borrowing , " Larry called it . Larry dressed like a used-car salesman and licked his lips a lot . Too obvious , perhaps , but he would bear watching . In the company of such strangers , our three-hour ride to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the passing scenery  --  mostly the back doors of America , anyway . Instead , as two of about 50 amateur sleuths , we analyzed alibis , bid at an auction of the Duke 's assets , mulled motives , deciphered encrypted messages and searched for missing pieces of a letter that might rectify our clueless condition . Carol 's prime suspect was Laurie Evans , the Duke 's concierge , who seemed to know what was in everybody 's hand but kept her own cards close to the vest . Laurie acted so sweet , but Carol thought she might be overplaying her bluff . I put my money on jillionaire Tom " Tex " Parker , who had wanted to buy the Duke 's casino , but got rebuffed . Tex had a manner as expansive as his 10-gallon hat , but craps shooters would have recognized those snake eyes . I could easily picture Tex helping the Duke cash out early . <p> The widow , Rosemary , was aboard the train too , working the crowd with a Blanche DuBois number about the kindness of strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids on the Duke 's material remains . " It 's hard to ask people for money before noon , " she said , but she seemed to manage . <p> Every once in a while , I took a peek at the porter seated at the back of the car . He still did n't look like a porter , but he was acting like one . Hmmm , maybe " acting " was the operative word . <p> Then , we were in Atlantic City , where we would confront the real crime  --  the odds at the casinos . We 'd get back to the mystery on the ride home to Washington that night . It 's true , as everybody says , that Atlantic City is a sad example of urban decay : boarded-up buildings , cracked sidewalks where weeds flourish , tenement housing right up to the back of the glitzy casinos . Somebody in city government sure cut a bad deal with the gambling guys . <p> But I had never been to the home of Miss America and Monopoly , so it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frolic in the waves and to amble along the real Park Place . <p> And did you know that you do n't have to be a toddler to be pushed in a stroller at Atlantic City ? Or that you can take advantage of one-stop eating and chow down on everything from lo mein to raw oysters to funnel cakes at the same food emporium ? Or that the organ at the convention center has 3,913 pipes , making it the world 's largest instrument of its kind ? On the boardwalk , you also can view all the myriad facets of the human form . <p> Landing on Boardwalk , though , especially when it has been improved with hotels always would end up as the developer of that prime beach-front property ( and the owner of all the railroads ) , while I eked out a living on low-rent Baltic Avenue . <p> I expected landing on Boardwalk would cost me this time too , and that " The Donald " was cut from the same ungenerous cloth as my brother . At least I would n't face foreclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go broke two bits at a time in a single afternoon . I 've been in casinos before , in Reno and Tahoe , so I was somewhat prepared for my entrance into the twilight-zone interiors of Atlantic City 's gambling palaces . But I was n't prepared for the crowds . It was hard to find an opening in the cheap seats , and even the $ 25-minimum-bet tables were full . Is this a sign of a healthy economy or impending doom ? <p> At Donald 's and Merv 's and Caesar 's , the light was muted and the noise glaring . The baseline tinkle and chunk of machines being fed was overlaid by the plinking rain of payoffs and the occasional celebratory whoop of a siren . The harmonic tones emitted by the slots and poker machines reminded me of the finale in " Close Encounters , " except with lots more aliens . Nobody talked much though , at least in my quarter-a-throw arena . Maybe sophisticated repartee was being parried at the baccarat tables , though I doubted it  --  nobody there looked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller , played the dollar blackjack machines . I stuck with video poker and hit the jackpot for my kind  --  125 quarters on a hand of four kings . ( That 's $ 31.25 to save you from doing the math . ) For the first time in my piddling gambling career , I needed a cup to haul around my winnings . Not for long , though . By the time we headed back to the train , more than a little weary , I was still ahead , but only by a nose . The first person we spotted in the station was that rolling equivalent of a butler , seated in a corner in stolid silence . Waiting passengers were still holding whispered discussions on the odds of his being among the who 's who of the whodunit , undeterred by all the vigorous claims to the contrary . Of course , everyone had to lay their cards on the table later that night  --  although not before more murder had been set in motion  --  so we finally found out who did the Duke in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants to know the answers will just have to ante up . <p> WAYS &; MEANS <p> The Murder Mystery Express to Atlantic City includes round-trip passage in a private Amtrak car , the mystery play and a decent cold breakfast of croissant , juice and fruit . Hot coffee for the needy can be had at Union Station or in the club car . <p> Cost : $ 99 . For reservations , call Mystery on the Menu , 202-333-6875 . The train leaves Union Station one Sunday each month at 8:30 a.m. and returns at 11 p.m . The next scheduled departures are Oct. 23 and Nov. 20 . Passengers also can board at New Carrollton , BWI and Baltimore . <p> On arrival in Atlantic City , we had the option of taking a free bus to the Sands Casino , which would spot us $ 5 in quarters , or of getting to the casino strip on our own . We took the money and bused . We then had about six hours on the loose . <p> Lunch was pizza topped with canned mushrooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boardwalk . Dinner was a burger and a Philly cheese steak , also consumed in a hurry  --  we were in Atlantic City not to waste time but to waste money . We noticed that all-you-can-eat bargain buffets were a big draw , though . Trump Plaza 's Broadway Buffet is $ 12.50 . <p> Of course , if you are of a mind , you can take all the mystery out of a trip to Atlantic City .
