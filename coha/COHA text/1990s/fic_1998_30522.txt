Franklin was telling his wife , Bell , about the little boy who got his head caught in the power window of the family car , about the Chinese woman ( a doctor ) who was kidnapped from a Citibank , about the four people who were shot down outside a bowling alley , about all the people who got dead that day . Franklin likes the news . He never have anything nice to talk . Why do n't he be quiet and eat his dinner , Bell thought . He was talking and Bell was looking at his little brown teeth moving up and down . She pulled at the waistband of her pants ; her stomach was getting nervous . The elastic was old and hardly made a sound when it snapped back around her . If not for her daughter , she would pick up her bowl and go down to the basement . Ruby had just moved back home and no one had told her yet that while she had been away , her mother fixed a plate for herself and went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself . Bell kept her face in her bowl , but every now and then her eyes opened wide as if she could n't believe what she was hearing . What she really could n't believe was that her baby had come back to her . And all dressed up in tight black clothes like she was going out to a party . Maybe it was her clothes that made her sit there so stiffly , as if afraid of her own family . Bell picked out a choice morsel of chicken and placed it in her daughter 's bowl . Ruby was so used to fending for herself that when the sweet white meat appeared in front of her , she nearly broke down and cried right there at the table . It did n't matter that she liked dark meat better . Her mother was chewing on a chicken foot . " You eat , " Ruby said and tried to put some meaore . " " He told your sister to buy some , but you know her , take her time . He must be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he does n't like me anymore . " " He do n't like no one . " Perched on the edge of the sink , Bell turned her face toward the open window . Next to her , dried salted flounder hung on a string that stretched from cabinet to window . She touched them respectfully . " Remember you used to love salty fish ? These are almost done . They have to get good and dry first . " " I still like it , " Ruby said quickly . There was something in her mother 's voice that she needed to defend herself against , as if her mother were accusing her of something that had nothing to do with fish . " Nobody saying you do n't like it . You need some pajamas ? " Bell got down slowly from the sink , as if she had aged since climbing up there . She had no idea what her daughter wore to bed these days and her voice was gruffer than she had intended . " How do you make salty fish ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Bell knew it too . " On the farm I make salty duck . You open it up and make it flat with your hand so it 's just like a cookie . " Bell busied herself with the fish , although there was nothing she could really do with them . " I had this duck one time . There was a sauce , with berries . And you know what ? It was n't even tough . You know how duck is . But this one , I do n't know . It was real tender . " Ruby talked slowly , as if it hurt her to remember that dinner ; she had just thrown away all her pink clothes , cut her hair short and was ready to try kissing . But now , sitting in her mother 's kitchen , she did n't think it seemed right that a duck should be that sweet and soft . " And the sauce . Oh , I told you . It had berries , " she said . Her mother 's hair was starting to thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining that the sun might burn the top of her mother 's head filled her with an angry rush of love and protectiveness . " Berries , huh ? At least it was n't tough . Well , getting late . You better get some rest . " It was only eight o'clock , but Bell did n't know what else to say . She wished she had never mentioned the fish , it seemed to upset her daughter so much . She put the kettle on and retied her apron . " Go ask your father if he want tea . Before he come in here with his smelly cigar . " Ruby was still thinking about the sun . It was May and starting to get hot . " Ma . Do you have a hat ? A sun hat ? " " I walk in the shade when it gets hot . " " You 've got freckles . Maybe you need a hat , " Ruby said . Finding the right hat for her mother could occupy her for days . Shopping was a misery for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her mother had always loved each other through sacrifice and worry , and ever since she could remember , her mother had been better at it . Look at their bowls . Ruby 's bowl is piled high with all the good bits , and there in her mother 's bowl , a heap of bones . But now that she 's grown , for once in her life she would like to push away the full bowl and eat from the other , the one her mother guards with both hands . For the four years that Ruby lived at school , she was haunted by a feeling of uneasiness , as if she had forgotten something , something important . But for the first time in her life she was having fun , so she ignored the feeling as best she could , hoping it would go away on its own . She bought new clothes that she thought disguised the fact that she was from Qu eens , wrote poems that were almost good , stayed up late talking with her new friends , who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank and then she talked about how her mother had been seventeen when she was married off to a man she did n't know . But it bothered her to talk about that and after a while she did n't anymore . Late at night , she cooked . The first year there was no kitchen , so she bought a two-burner cooker and waited until the hall counselor went to sleep ; then she opened the tiny rented refrigerator , which fit exactly two six-packs but which Ruby had filled with food she had bought that day at the markets on Broadway . Later , she walked down the hall to see who was still awake ; she fed them . Her friends gave her cookbooks and told her she should be a cook since she was n't going to be a journalist anymore . One morning her hair got in her way , so she cut it off . What was left stuck up all over her head . She took up with a boy she refused to sleep with for six months for fear of becoming a slut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own her , giving her the pleasure of asserting that she would n't be owned ( except in bed  --  damn that pleasure of giving in ) ; she threw herself into her new life , but the nagging feeling would n't leave her . She pushed it away , but it came back stronger each time and finally , at the end of four years , she gave in , packed her things and came home again . One summer , she told herself . One summer at home would n't kill her . But she would have to sleep in her mother 's room again , as she had for eighteen years . Her brother and sister had slept in the same room too , but Lily had moved to the apartment upstairs and Van had moved away . Her f ather slept in his own room . It had been years since Ruby had slept in the same room with someone she was n't fucking . It gave her a funny feeling . But right now she had no choice . She had $124 in her account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would move out . She was n't planning on staying forever . Not on her life would she stay forever . That 's what she told herself as she packed up her things and headed back to Queens . She had n't told her parents she was coming . " What 'd you think ? We 'd throw you out on the street ? " her father said when she showed up and asked if she could move back for a while . He said it triumphantly , as if he had waited for years for her to ask him for something so he could say yes but begrudgingly , and there was her mother asking , " You 're here for a while ? " with fear and hope in her eyes . Ruby was fighting mad to be home again ( she felt coerced , as if someone or something had twisted her arm behind her back ) and she had answered grumpily , " I do n't know how long . " Her mother 's face closed up again and then she disappeared into her room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue shirt with pleats and puffed sleeves that she had gotten on sale at JCPenneys . One side of her collar stuck up higher than the other ; the buttons were done up wrong . Ruby put down her bags and it hit her right away that the blue shirt was for dress-up and that her mother had put it on for her sake . And then it was all over . The words " You win " popped into Ruby 's head , although she had n't been aware that there had been a fight going on . They did n't look at each other as she fixed up her mother 's buttons . Her fingers were clumsy and damp ; every little defense that Ruby had built up against her mother was stripped away . She wanted to throw herself around her mother 's knees and cry out , " Do n't leave me . " It did n't matter that her mother was n't going anywhere and that she herself would be the one to leave . The nagging feeling was stronger than ever ( what was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she realized that it was her mother she had forgotten ; it was her mother she had left behind and had finally come back to get . Ruby buttoned the last button and took her hands reluctantly from her mother 's shirt . It is May and I am home once again in the rooms behind Lee 's Hand Laundry , located in Springfield , Queens . It 's not a place you would happen to end up in during your travels , you really have to want to find it . First you get on the R train and ride all the way out to the very last stop . Get off at Union Street . Go upstairs and take the bus , the Q44 , the Q63 , the Q29  --  or , if you 're lucky , you can take the Q66 so you do n't have to walk down from Main Street . But chances are you 've come on the weekend ; the 66 does n't run on the weekends or holidays , like you should just stay home on those days . So take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from Main . You can walk down Cedarhurst Boulevard if you want an ice-cream sandwich from the German deli , or you can walk down the side streets , where there is shade and rows and rows of single-family houses . You can tell who just got new aluminum siding . That was a good choice , nice color . But that one over there , the green one , just awful . In front are grassy plots with flowers and hushes trimmed on Saturdays by husbands in their undershirts . Among the hushes are statues of ducks and deer and the Seven Dwarfs and the Virgin Mary holding her arms out to you . When you hit Hollis Avenue , you can see how things have changed . There are new bodegas that have the same yellow-and-red awnings and men sitting outside on crates . You can buy cold cuts , cold beer and big green bananas . There are homemade churches without stained glass , just cardboard signs : VISION OF VICTORY TEMPLE , HOUSE OF RECONCILIATION , LA PUERTA ABIERTA . Sometimes there is n't even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can hear the preaching and singing and clapping on Sundays and you can see the dressed-up people coming out afterward with light in their eyes . Some even wear hats . Next to Shell Gas Station is the transmission place with the pack of rabid dogs that bark and jump and throw themselves against the fence when someone walks by . Better not to walk on that side . The two bowling alleys are gone . The one on the corner , where we used to play handball , turned first into a karate school and then into a shooting gallery . Now you see people coming out of their cars carrying rifles in protective sheaths instead of bowling balls . Cardinal Lanes is now a nightclub . " Do n't go near there , " my father tells me . " People get shot . " In the middle of the block is Lee 's Hand Laundry , where I grew up . The swinging sign that said LAUNDRY in big block letters no longer swings above the door since it fell down during a storm . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gotten sued . The other sign , the one that 's painted right onto the glass in red at the top of the window , LEE 'S HAND LAUNDRY , is chipping off . You can barely make out the LEE 'S . The screen door slams behind you and you f ind you 're no longer a visitor but a resident again . Visitors come for a few hours and leave when the sun goes down , before the sitcoms begin . The crumb cake or Danish ring you pick up at Hillsdale Bakery and swing back and forth as you walk down the hill is proof you are visiting . If you lived here , you would n't be swinging that cake like it was the sweetest thing you ever carried , the sweetest thing you were ever going to eat with a cup of tea that your mother will make for you when you get there , after she says you should n't have gone to the trouble . If you lived here , you would be carrying an Entenmann 's cake , like all-butter pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of cake , but dragging your suitcase behind you . When Ruby was a kid , around the time when other little girls were being dandled on their daddy 's knee , touching the stubble on his face and thinking about marrying him when they grew up , she was dreaming about marrying her mother and taking her away . She pictured a small house in the woods with a garden out back where her mother would grow vegetables . There would be no building next door blocking the sun , stunting her tomatoes and beans . In front , there would be a porch , not just a sidewalk in front of a store where people sat on lounge chairs and fanned themselves with magazines . In the evenings , she and her mother would sit on the swing bench , drink tea from a blue and white pot and talk until the night ran out . Six years old and in love with her mother . After dinner , her mother would go out to the yard and water her garden . As she stood there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighbor 's fence . Ruby watched her night after night before sh e figured out the look on her mother 's face ; it was a lonesome look . That was her father 's fault , Ruby thought . He had gone to China and had taken her mother away from everyone she knew and brought her to a strange country , and then , to top it off , he was n't kind to her . The soil in the backyard was poor , there was n't enough sun and squirrels picked the green tomatoes , took a few bites and left them on the ground . Ruby was six when she gathered the ruined tomatoes and decided it was up to her to look after her mother . Her mother was fiercely independent , though , and was n't looking for anyone to take care of her , but slowly Ruby found little ways to help her mother and her mother came to lean on her . Now Ruby was twenty-two and still wanted to take her mother away . It was past midnight on her first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little house in the woods was gone and now she saw an apartment in the city  --  wood floors , lots of light . Sometimes it had one bedroom and sometimes two . Her mother had a lot of things . They would need hundreds of boxes and a big truck . Take a look at her kitchen counter , all cluttered with milk containers and bits of used foil and tons of jars , all the labels soaked off . Bell loved jars and ended up buying things she did n't particularly care for  --  stewed prunes , mint jelly , even pickled beets  --  just because they came in a nice jar . It made Ruby sad as hell that her mother ate all those things she did n't even like . Maybe she had made a mistake in coming back ; her mother had always saved things and would go on saving things , and there was nothing Ruby could do about it . It was n't just jars but paper bags and old zippers and bakery string and anyth ing else she could put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that she had such tendencies herself , but she fought them by throwing everything away . She liked her apartment bare . If her mother came to live with her , the place would get all cluttered . They would have to get a big place ; her mother would have her own room and Ruby would have her own room and the two rooms would n't be right next to each other . You would n't hear every little thing the other person was doing in her room , but if you needed help and called out , she would hear you . Maybe they would live up the block from a bakery where they could get apple turnovers for dessert . Shoot , maybe they 'd even get a ficus tree to put in the window . She latched on to the idea of the tree , maybe a braided one , but then again , maybe it hurt the tree to be all twisted up like that . The plain kind might be better , but a good tall one with lots of leaves . The tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A two-bedroom in Manhattan . With lots of windows and wood floors . Keep dreaming , sister , she told herself . Do n't be so negative , she told herself . How the hell are you going to get a house for your mother when you do n't even have a house for yourself ? I 'll figure it out , give me a break . What are you going to do , play Lotto ? Goddammit , maybe I will . If she won Lotto , she would take her mother to Florida . Her mother had always wanted to go to Florida ; she had heard that it was hot there , like her village in China . And then , a few years ago , her friends Louie and Sheila from around the corner had moved there . They used to stop by the laundry once a week with a box of Italian pastries , miniatures . Now they lived in Fl orida and called their old friends a couple of times a year to invite them down . They said to Bell : " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation ? Tell that cheap bastard husband of yours to leave his cigar at home and come on down . " But Franklin would never go to Florida . The idea of her father getting on a plane with shorts and undershirts in his suitcase cracked her up . He did n't even walk to the corner to get his newspaper , cars made him dizzy and shoes hurt his feet . When he was in the army he had been stationed in different countries , and now he was satisfied to stay at home and resented it when anyone else went out except to run his errands . " I 've already seen the world , why should I go out ? " he said whenever anyone told him he should get some air . Florida did n't cost so much ; Ruby did n't have to win Lotto to take her mother on vacation . If she could put up with temping for a couple of months , they could go . A vacation , that 's what they needed . Blow out of town , have some goddamned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Ruby did n't want to stay with them . She wanted to stay in a hotel where she could see the water as soon as she woke up in the morning . The night she moved home , the room was too small , her hair smelled of cigars and her mother 's bed was too close to hers . Her father was snoring in the room next door , making such a racket he might as well have been in the same room . If only someone would touch her , maybe she would calm down . Her hand played with the hem of the flowered granny gown that her mother had ironed for her and soon she was touching herself to ease the tightness . As her knees fell open , she wondered if her mother was really sleeping or whe ther she could hear the slippery wet sounds . Ruby waited , listened to her mother 's breathing and then her hand started moving again until she was soft and open and soon she wanted to scream . She did n't because she knew that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the rest would come rushing out and she would n't be able to stop . She would n't be able to stop all the noises she did not make in her parents ' house . That no one made in her parents ' house . Now she lay in bed smelling her fingers . Christ , she smelled good . It was too bad Nick was n't there ; the smell drove him crazy . He was her boyfriend , although she did n't like that word . He wanted her to come and live with him , and when she was having a weak moment she wanted to . But then she thought about her mother sitting in the basement watching TV by herself and she got mad at him for harassing her , she called it . He 'd look resigned and she 'd wonder with fear in her heart how long he would wait . He knew in his heart it was silly to think about marrying a girl like Ruby who would n't stop running around . But she loved him , she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a selfish bitch , the ones who knew her thought she loved him but was confused . Sometimes she cried when he fucked her , just as she was coming . That made him feel close to her and gave him hope that one day she would grow up and settle down . Secretly , Ruby hoped she would too . At school she had wanted to sleep alone some nights , but when he knocked on her door at two or three in the morning , she only pretended to be mad . Now she wanted to call him . " Where are you ? " he would say , even though he knew exactly where she was . He had never been there , but he had heard all about it for three years and had almost given up on seeing it for himself . When he first met Ruby , he had taken her home to meet his parents , who lived in Boston . His father had given him the thumbs-up sign . His mother was a bossy lady who had decorated her house with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did n't like her son going out with a Chinese girl . Nick had pulled his mother aside and talked to her in his reasonable way and in the end she had let them sleep in the same room . Now he was three trains and a bus ride away . Ruby got out of bed and went out to the laundry . The store was dimly lit by the street lamp and passing cars that threw shadows across the walls . Two spray guns for spritzing clothes hung from the ceiling . Ruby remembered she had n't been allowed to touch them or the ceiling would fall down , her father had said , but when he was n't looking she would grab a sprayer and start a water fight with Helen Hong until he chased them outside , cursing in Chinese . Although Franklin had never bought one plant , somehow the laundry was lush and green . Lemons and tiny sour oranges grew in the window . Aloe , good for iron burns , grew too big for their pots , crowding and pushing like too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but still they grew , defiantly , almost , not needing much from anybody . The laundry was quiet except for the murmuring of the fish tank and occasional trains passing . Ruby sat crosslegged on the ironing table , meditating on the rows of laundry wrapped in brown paper with numbered tickets in front . There was no ironing , no starching , no heat . No Daddy 's cigar puffing in her face , no Daddy telling her she 'd get piles from sitting up there . No customers bowing and winking , " No tickee , no shirtee . " The last train on the Long Island Rail Road 's Springfield line went by . People leaned their heads against the dark windows and had no idea that the storefront rattled and the whole house shook as they passed . After the train was gone , the only thing moving was the lonely sign at Shell Gas Station ; it turned round and round with the patience of nuns , a big yellow seashell that split the night . It was hours before people would gather at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the bus to bring them to the train to bring them to yet another day at work ; hours before the first shopkeepers would arrive , unlocking the gates that covered their windows , waiting for the first sale of the day ; hours before Ruby would put her shoes on , take a few coins from the register and go around the corner to Jack 's Candy Store to get her father 's newspaper so he could look for a story to tell his wife at dinner , a story that would make her look up from her plate and take notice of him once and for all . In the darkened laundry she blinked her eyes , which were worse than ever . At college , with all the books she could pile on her back and carry home , soon she could only see things that were very near  --  words on a page , food on a plate . If it was near enough to touch , to taste , she could see it . That was it . Graduation was over . On account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , but she did put on the rented cap and gown , satiny blue , over her regular black clothes and Converse All Stars and walked around campus with her mother , who told her to stand by the blooming azalea bush , and then sh e took pictures to show her friends at the factory . ( " Pretty , what a pretty daughter you have . Does she have a boyfriend ? I have a son , same age . Good boy . Study hard , smart in school . Save money too , not like my other boy , spend all his money on clothes . Is she fussy about boys ? She 's kind of tall . How did she get so tall ? Must be too much American food . Does she eat cheese ? " ) After they finished taking pictures Ruby and Bell went for tea and cake at Magda 's . It was empty that day ; everyone was standing in a muddy field , in their good shoes , no less , holding black umbrellas . Bell looked at the cakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts on top ? What about that one ? Oh , cranberry . Cranberry make my tongue feel funny . Do you come here a lot ? What time does it close ? " She did not say , " Is this where you are when I call you late at night and you 're not home ? " Even though she had n't lived so very far from the laundry , just one borough away , for God 's sake , it was rare that she would visit . She told herself it was the subway ride she could n't bear , and waiting on the platform for the train to take her closer and closer to Queens . Reading the same ads over and over gave her that closed-in feeling , and so she looked at the other people traveling to places they did n't want to go to either , driven by love or money or pain back to the places they would be happy never to see again . Once again Ruby found herself in the four rooms she had grown up in and all she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language she could n't even read , that hardly anyone could read . It did come with a translation , but she 'd lost it the first day she got it . At first it seemed important that she find it , as if it co uld explain , of all the places in the world , what the hell she was doing behind the laundry again . It was only partly that she did n't have money or a job or a house of her own . There was something else , something she could n't quite place that had pulled her away from mornings where she would reach out and touch the hair of the one sleeping next to her . This was how she figured which of her lovers would eat the plums that morning , drink the tea and slip her a dream , get on top and hold her down as if she were trying to get away . And there were irises on the nightstand , for crying out loud . Day after day , croissants and omelettes and pancakes with cream on top . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one could hold her down long enough to keep her from running . When she stopped running , there she was , back where she had started from . She hated the entire borough of Queens and particularly , the laundry and the people who lived behind it . Her hatred made the laundry and the people belong to her and her alone , and so her hatred was softened by a sense of ownership , like someone who kicks his dog and then gives it a biscuit because it is his dog to kick and to give a biscuit to . Even while she was hating it she could n't take her eyes from the walls and the ceilings and the television , and out of the corner of her eye she could see her mother and father living in separate rooms . She put her hand to her chest and wondered how she had ever left the house that was n't even a house but four rooms behind a laundry , how she had gone away to school and lived like a regular American girl .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
