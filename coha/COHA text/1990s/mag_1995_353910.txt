YOU CA N'T RATTLE DICK LUGAR BY bringing up nuclear throw weights or prewar Serbian history . But just broach the charisma issue and the presidential candidate is on the defensive . Pundits hint that Lugar is charismatically challenged , that his political persona is as flat as an Indiana cornfield , that he is , in short , too bland to be President . " Gee , " Dick Lugar says , " I know that people say I 'm far too low-key , even that "  --  and here a brief , sad smile  --  " I 'm dull . " <P> But in Albuquerque , New Mexico , recently , a different Dick Lugar was on display . Here was Richard Green Lugar  --  Eagle Scout , Rhodes Scholar , jogger , farmer , grandfather  --  and Republican sex symbol . When the four-term Indiana Senator strode into a cocktail party at the National Federation of Republican Women conference wearing a broad smile and a blue suit , a hundred ladies were all atwitter . A Colorado woman in sequined denim sighed , " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida had a twinkle in her bifocals : " He 's even better-looking in person than he is on TV ! " A lady with a WOMEN FOR GRAMM button elbowed a woman in elephant earrings to get next to him . <P> Lugar downplays such tomfoolery . He 's a serious man who thinks seriously about serious issues . He ca n't help it if he comes across as the reincarnation of the perfect 1950s TV dad  --  good-looking and good-humored , Father Knows Best for the 1990s . ( In Indiana he is strongly supported by women 18 to 35 . ) At a time in the national political debate when all sides bemoan lack of civility , Lugar is civility itself . " I propose a new Republican commandment , " he frequently asserts . " Thou shalt not speak ill of other Americans . " And while he is philosophically conservative ( he voted with Ronald Reagan more than any other Senator ) , Lugar , in his quiet way , offers some of the boldest proposals  --  indeed the single most revolutionary one  --  of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech to the convention that is otherwise colorless  --  Lugar 's idea of an applause line is , " Let me say at the outset that a strong America is imperative "  --  he jolts his audience midway through . " I am advocating , " he declares , " nothing less than the ending of all income tax , the abolishing of the Internal Revenue Service , and the substitution of a national sales tax . " ( He draws cheers . ) Lugar wants to eliminate all personal and corporate income taxes , including estate and inheritance taxes , in favor of a 17% national sales tax on goods and services . To prevent the system from being too regressive , he would exempt certain foods and medicine and not tax the first $5,000 worth of purchases . " Every dollar you earn is yours , " he says . This is greeted with scattered clapping , but when a gray-haired matron hears him peg the sales tax at 17% , she exclaims , " Lordy ! "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
