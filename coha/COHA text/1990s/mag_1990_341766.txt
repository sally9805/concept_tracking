America 's amazing August charge into the desert of Saudi Arabia could have been a military disaster . The first troops to arrive were ill-equipped and vastly outnumbered by the Iraqi tank army poised in occupied Kuwait . Soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division were told to expect to go directly into combat , though they carried nothing more effective against tanks than puny Dragon rockets and risky-to-use TOW missiles . <P> " If Saddam Hussein had struck during those early days , " says Dave McCurdy , a member of the House Armed Services Committee , " our troops would have been slaughtered . " Since then , at least 40,000 American soldiers and Marines and almost a million tons of equipment have followed . But senior officers say they still need another month or two of rapid buildup to reach adequate defensive strength . Only last week , 22 days after Operation Desert Shield got under way , did the first M-1 tanks , which would be essential for fighting Iraqi armor , arrive at Saudi ports . <P> Fortunately the only battle in the gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a tough one . Despite the $2.5 trillion spent on defense over the past decade , the U.S. lacks enough cargo planes and ships to deliver its armed forces to trouble spots around the globe . Transport planes like the C- 141 Starlifter and C-5A Galaxy are still the workhorses of the Air Force , but they are aging , and their production lines have long been closed . The next-generation airlifter , the C-17 , has encountered repeated delays in nine years of development and is not yet in service . In the meantime , most of the troops and 25% of the supplies flying to Saudi Arabia are traveling on wide- body planes leased from commercial airlines . <P> Much of the Army 's heavy equipment , including hundreds of tanks and helicopters , will be delivered by sea  --  the biggest bottleneck . The Navy has only eight SL-7 fast-logistics ships specifically designed for such work , and two have already broken down at sea ; one is being towed across the Atlantic . In a pinch like this , the Navy is supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has ordered up 41 of them , but so far only 25 have got under way . The Navy last week was chartering 15 American and foreign cargo ships to pick up the slack . <P> Such difficulties have revived a debate over U.S. defense needs in the post- cold war world that had seemed all but settled . No longer faced with the threat of a Soviet onslaught in Europe , it appeared that America could safely spend far less on military might . Only two days before Iraqi armored units rolled into Kuwait , the House had slashed $24 billion from the Pentagon 's $307 billion proposed budget , eliminating such high-priced weapons as the B-2 Stealth bomber and mobile MX missile . The Senate was only slightly more restrained , chopping $18 billion . While disagreeing with some items on the congressional hit list , even Defense Secretary Dick Cheney agreed that some reductions were needed . He had just completed a strategic review and was about to propose cutting 10% from the Pentagon budget and 25% from its manpower over the next five years .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
