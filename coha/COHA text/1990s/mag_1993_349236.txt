For years , cable-TV operators and telephone companies have behaved like jealous rivals  --  spreading gossip about each other 's weaknesses , whining to regulators about monopolistic bullying and watching with suspicion any attempt by one to poach on the other 's territory . The sniping has grown even shriller in recent months as it became clear that the two industries were on a collision course in their separate efforts to build the so-called electronic super-highway  --  that futuristic information pipeline over which people will soon order up everything from the latest Hollywood movies to the hottest new video games . <P> So it came as somewhat of a surprise when two of the biggest players  --  Time Warner , the nation 's second largest cable operator , and U S West , the fifth $ largest telephone company  --  announced last week that they were becoming digital partners . In a deal that sent television- , telecommunications- and entertainment-industry analysts scrambling back to their spreadsheets , the two companies announced a $2.5 billion strategic alliance in which U S West will supply technological savvy ( and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time Warner Entertainment , one of the world 's largest collections of entertainment copyrights , including the film and TV properties of Warner Bros. , HBO and Lorimar . ( Time Warner 's music and publishing operations , which include this magazine , are not part of Time Warner Entertainment and thus are excluded from the deal . ) <P> The marriage of two such powerful partners is certain to accelerate the conversion of modern cable TV into the two-way , interactive system that will allow consumers to order movies , browse through store merchandise , send pictures of the kids to Grandma , make phone calls and request a wide variety of information services  --  all by pushing buttons on their TV remote controls . Time Warner officials now say it will take five years  --  not 10 , as previously estimated  --  for these new services to be rolled out to the company 's 7.1 million cable subscribers . <P> The deal is likely to reshape business alliances in both industries .

Meanwhile , the deal could shatter whatever solidarity still exists among the so-called Baby Bells  --  the seven regional phone companies that were created by the breakup of AT &T; in 1984 . Until now , each has enjoyed a monopoly on local telephone service in its own region ; long-distance phone companies had to pay a hefty fee to , say , BellSouth , in order to connect to a phone customer in Atlanta . But through its new alliance , U S West will , in theory , be able to provide local phone service to Time Warner cable subscribers outside the Western states , threatening to grab a share of the long-distance connect charges that account for a quarter of the Baby Bells ' revenues and half their profits .
