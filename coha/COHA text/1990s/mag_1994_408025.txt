IT 'S THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL , AND YOUR child 's back on the school bus again . As he slips into a seat and the bus lumbers off , what parent would n't have a few qualms ? " How safe are those things , really ? " you ask yourself . Let 's start with the reassuring news . According to Transport Canada 's 1989 Background Paper on School Bus Occupant Protection in Canada , schoolbuses are a surprisingly safe mode of transportation . Between 1982/83 and 1985/86 , for example , six children were killed while riding a schoolbus , while another 60 sustained " major injuries . That 's an average of 1.5 deaths and 15 major injuries a year , for some 36,000 buses  --  and while we 'd all like the figures to be even lower , they compare favourably with injury statistics for motor vehicles . In fact , Transport Canada estimates that during this same period , automobile occupants were " 16 times more likely than school bus occupants to be injured in road accidents per passenger - kilometre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations govern schoolbus safety standards , from vehicle specifications and equipment to driver licensing . In 1980 , new federal standards improved bus safety by requiring increased body joint strength ( so the bus can withstand greater impact ) ; improved window retention and emergency exits ; better fuel system integrity ( to minimize fuel leaks in a collision ) ; and improved occupant protection . And here we get to the Seat Belt Question . After spending years diligently buckling our children in and out of car seats , booster seats , and lap belts , it seems bizarre to many parents that schoolbuses in most jurisdictions remain " seat belt free . " " should n't our kids be buckling up ? Maybe not  --  at least not with the current design of buses . In 1984 , Transport Canada crash - tested schoolbuses , to measure the effect of seat belts . Surprisingly , the belted crash dummies came out worse on several counts : they sustained " more severe head and lower chest accelerations " and " more severe rearward neck extensions " than their unrestrained counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them with more concentrated , intense force . There are other problems with seat belts . To be effective , they must be worn and fitted properly . Who 's going to check that the children have their belts tightened ? Schoolbuses may seat three young children , or two older ones , to a seat . Seats fittedwith three sets of belts will be uncomfortable for larger passengers . Drivers , understandably , are concerned about liability . Is it their responsibility to ensure kids wear their belts ? And what if they do n't , and there 's an accident ? A metal buckle at the end of a long belt could make a dangerous projectile . Because of all these concerns , government standards have focused instead on making the seats themselves as safe as possible . New design features attempt to " compartmentalize " passengers by " containing students between high - backed , heavily padded , closely spaced seats . " Reviews of recent accidents seem to show that these measures are quite effective . Do we breathe a collective sigh of relief ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're riding in the bus . It 's getting on and off that can be dangerous . And while some types of equipment  --  like the " stop arms " that are required in some provinces to remind motorists to stop for the bus - may help , the bottom line is the safety awareness of both drivers and students . That 's why Gwen Rosenberg , owner - operator of Brockville ( Ontario ) City Bus Lines for the past 50 years , is so proud of her bus safety program . " I started the program because safety is my number one concern , " she says . We assemble the children in the gym , two or three grades at a time . The children listen to an informal talk geared to that particular age group , and the discussion is followed by a video presentation : either Sammy the Safety Bear Goes to School or , for the older kids , The Death Zone , each followed by a question period " After the video , the kids are taken onto a bus where they can try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in a mock emergency evacuation , " says Rosenberg , " and the younger students get a certificate .
