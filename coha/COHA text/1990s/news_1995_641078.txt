<p> CHAD Edwards leaped high for the rebound as an opponent 's shot clanked off the rim . As soon as he landed , Edwards rifled a long pass to Rodney Billups streaking down the floor . <p> Billups in full stride pulled in the pass and dribbled down the left side of the lane . At full-speed , he shoveled the ball under a defender 's outstretched arms to Ahmad Nelms running down the other side of the lane . <p> Nelms immediately whipped the ball behind his back to Noah Jefferson streaking down the middle of the lane . Uncontested , Jefferson finger-rolled the ball into the basket for an easy score . <p> " Good pass . Good pass . Good pass . Nice shot , " coach Horace Kearney yelled , his gravelly voice punctuating each stage of the play . <p> The entire sequence took less time than you spent reading about it . <p> But that 's not surprising , considering that the players are four of the best basketball players in the state . What is surprising , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> KEARNEY walked through the gym door at Skyland Recreation Center and into the buoyant bedlam only kids can create . Their voices seemed to multiply as shouts bounced off the gym 's scuffed brown and white walls . The ghosts of players past hovered throughout the gym in the bittersweet smell of sweat . <p> Kearney , 47 , moved on the court with the easy grace of an athlete . He wore his work clothes : green sweat pants , battered white Converse high-tops and an orange T-shirt with the legend " Skyland Basketball . " Between the lettering , it carried a graphic of a curved string of basketballs that grow increasingly larger . It looked like a horn of plenty . <p> Designed by the center 's supervisor , Harry Hollings , it is the perfect logo for the Skyland Recreation Center . The center squats next to a park in the 3300 block of Holly Street . <p> Community activists fought to get the center built in the early 1960s , and since then it has been an incubator for the best basketball talent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school stars such as Jamal Coleman , Johnnie Reese and Chauncey Billups . <p> Chauncey , Rodney 's older brother , is the best high school player ever in Colorado . He has been picked three times as high school player of the year . This season will end his career at George Washington High School , where he has led the team to two straight state championships . All the major college basketball powers have tried to recruit the 6-feet 2-inch point guard , but he remains uncommitted . <p> Another star on those teams was Fred Edmonds , who is now playing at the University of Colorado at Boulder . He also developed his talents on the Skyland floor . <p> At center court , Kearney lifted the silver-colored whistle that hung around his neck . Two quick blasts slapped the gym silent . " Sixth-graders over here . Everybody else out of the gym . <p> " Everybody have a seat around the round table , " he said , and the youngsters flopped down around the center circle . <p> " I have some disturbing news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing news is ? The disturbing news is that Centaurus lost . So guess what ? That puts us in a tie for first . " <p> Skyland and 12 other teams from around the metro area make up the Stapleton Recreation Center 's sixth-grade league . Centaurus in early December handed Skyland its only loss . <p> But the loss did n't change Kearney 's mind about his team . " This team is , I think , probably going to be my best group of kids ever . " <p> But they still have to be developed . <p> " We have to start refining our game a little for the stretch run , " he told the round table . " If you 're not playing in a game , I do n't want you to come up and say , ' Kearney , put me in . Kearney , can I go in ? ' You 're not going to ask your coach in high school or college to put you in the game . Do n't beg . In the meantime , this is where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't fool around , work . <p> " One more thing , " Kearney said as he walked down and stood right at the basket . " All you little Magic Johnsons , forget the pass when you get here . We do n't need passes . We need buckets . I know the passes look pretty , but we want the bucket . It 's simple : He who puts the ball through the hoop the most times wins the game . " <p> He pauses for effect , and then starts the drills with his standard line : " Let 's hit the wall , and no clowning around . " <p> He knows , of course , clowning is part of being a sixth-grader . To keep them focused , he uses several drills each practice . Most of them simulate game situations and often include competition . <p> " We try to teach the kids good , solid , basic , sound techniques while they are young . Then , by the time we turn them over to the high school coaches , they have less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next step - college . " <p> " We have parents who will bring their kids from all over to play here because we have a reputation of having good solid teams in whatever sport , " Kearney said . <p> Skyland 's basketball program starts with third-graders . Third- , fourth- and fifth-graders play on a team coached by Tony Wells and Bill Johnson . ( Wells also runs the nationally respected Skyland girls ' track team . ) Kearney coaches the sixth- and eight-grade teams . The seventh-grade coach is Eric Carroll . <p> Tariq Abdul-Hamig serves as the center 's science teacher . The science ? Shooting a basketball . <p> Abdul-Hamig , who served as a Marine in the Vietnam War , also coaches tennis . He has turned out a steady stream of national-caliber tennis players . Tall , broad and imposing , Abdul-Hamig is n't quiet about his demand that kids show respect and discipline . <p> " I do n't care about race , " Abdul-Hamig said . " I do n't care about social or economic status . If a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll help them . ... What I do is install in them the love of striving for excellence . " <p> ' YOU 'D laugh if I broke some of the old scoring books out , " Kearney said as a smile played across a face that is saved from looking stern by the twinkle in his eyes . He sat with a visitor in the small office behind the reception area at Skyland . He leaned back in his chair as he continued to talk about Chauncey Billups and Edmonds . <p> " Two points here , maybe four points there . When ' Smooth ' and Edmonds get to bragging sometimes , I go bring the books out and say , ' Oh , see what they were like back then . ' And then we really have a laugh . " <p> Kearney saves the scorebooks from all his games . The numbers tell the history of the more than 300 basketball games he has coached at Skyland since he hired on in December 1974 . <p> The old scorebooks record all the coaches ' efforts in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not show their success or failure . <p> " We look at success around here as how many kids can come through our program and go to college , " Kearney said . <p> When the National Collegiate Athletic Association enacted Proposition 48 , the coaches and the center 's director recognized their program needed a new focus . Prop 48 , as it is called , sets the score high school seniors must reach on college entrance exams to play varsity sports . An athlete who scores below that level can not play as a freshman and loses a year of eligibility unless he attends a junior college . <p> " We started our educational program because many of our kids were getting college scholarships but their grades were n't good enough , so they ended up having to go to junior college , " said Skyland supervisor Hollings , well-known as a former University of Denver basketball great . <p> Sherdyne Cornish , a teacher at George Washington , heads the center 's educational effort , the Academic Skills Program . She tutors students three hours a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started for the athletes , other students also have taken advantage of it . Now , they outnumber the athletes in Cornish 's program , Hollings said . <p> Skyland players must maintain a C average . A single F on a report card means the loss of eligibility , but the center lines them up with a tutor . A player with a D is given three weeks to raise the grade . Failure to do so means no team basketball . <p> Twice each season coaches give their players a progress report to be completed by their teachers and returned to the coaches . The form asks about academic performance , as well as behavior and attitude . <p> Anita White 's son Kenny plays on the sixth-grade team , and she likes the academic requirements . <p> " His school work has n't gone down at all in middle school because he knows he ca n't play if his grades fall , " she said . <p> Her nephew , Herman White , played for Kearney last year on the eighth-grade team . This year he carries a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he plays basketball and football . <p> " He helped us with our grades , " Herman White said of Kearney . " He helped us to keep eligible . ... He always had us going in the right direction . " <p> " Going in the right direction " could serve as legend on Skyland 's basketball T-shirts . <p> " The biggest problem I see is the gangs , " Hollings said . " That 's the reason why we really try to get kids involved in athletics . Athletics , to me , anyway , is the best out . <p> " If the kids get involved in athletics , No.1 , it is going to take care of their spare time , and No.2 , they have to maintain a C average to play so that means they are going to do a little bit in school . " <p> Hollings knows Skyland helps kids who need direction . <p> " The kids we are saving are those borderline kids , " he said . " Those hard-core gang members , we ca n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of here as fast as they come in . All they are going to do is recruit the kids that are in here . But those who could go either way , you can reach them . " <p> Failure means more than losing a game . <p> " Some of the kids that came to our program are now dead , " Kearney said . " You ask in your mind , ' How did he get caught up in that ? ' Or you ask , ' Was there something I could have said to the parents or to him that would have prevented his death ? ' You just ca n't be 100 percent successful . " <p> NEIGHBORS shook their heads in humorous disbelief as they watched the two young friends tramp through the snow on their way to play basketball at Cole Junior High School . <p> Kearney was 8 then , and his friend Hollings was 10 . <p> " Harry is the one who got me off into basketball , " Kearney said . " When we were little , we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cole to play . They used to laugh at us , but it paid off . We got scholarships to college . " <p> Hollings chuckled when reminded of those snowy practices with the boy he first met when they attended Mitchell Elementary School . <p> " We grow up within four blocks of each other , " he said . " We 're more like brothers than friends . Both of us grew up in an environment that probably was a little worse than the one the kids here at the center are in . That gives us an idea of where they are coming from , " Hollings said . <p> Kearney 's worst time came in junior high school . <p> " My mother died when I was in the eighth grade , " he said . " It was pretty tough but I fought through it . " <p> He had people there to help . His father was still alive . And there was Hollings ' mother , who was a friend of Kearney 's mother . <p> " If he needed to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to stay , he would come over to our place , " Hollings said . <p> And Ed Calloway Sr. and Donnie Wilson were there . They were schoolteachers who volunteered their off-duty time to help kids through athletics . Calloway later became a legendary basketball coach at Manual High School . <p> Kearney and Hollings starred in basketball at Manual , before Calloway coached there . <p> Hollings accepted a basketball scholarship at DU where he became one the nation 's top scorers . He still holds a trunk full of DU records . <p> Kearney was a sophomore then , but also left Manual and moved to Houston . He returned for his senior year and played point guard on the 1966 Manual team that went undefeated . Many people still consider that state championship team the best ever in Colorado . <p> The championship was special for Kearney because of a vow he made when he was a sophomore and Manual lost a state berth in a playoff game with East High School . <p> " I was in the stands watching the game . After looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locker room , I vowed to myself that I would wear Stanely Reynolds number when I got up to be a senior and win state wearing it . " <p> Reynolds , one of the Big Eight 's top basketball referees , was Manual 's starting point guard that year . His number was 53 , and Kearney wore it through the undefeated championship season . <p> " Now , whenever we see each other , I say , ' Hi , No.53 . ' And he goes , ' How ya doing No.53 . " ' <p> Kearney set his sights on a Navy career during his senior year , but his father talked him into going to college . He received 18 scholarship offers . He picked DU , rejoining Hollings . <p> Hollings described Kearney as a Robert Pack-type point guard . At 5-foot-10 , Kearney was excellent at driving the lane and could finish two-handed dunks with authority . <p> Kearney turned down chances to play professional ball here and in Europe when he left DU . He worked in Denver for a while before moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Denver and , in December 1974 , joined Hollings at Skyland . <p> " I first started coaching because what I wanted to do was give something back to the community , " Kearney said . <p> That Kearney is a successful coach does n't surprise Tony Sandoval , the longtime director of the Salvation Army 's Red Shield Center . <p> " He was a clean kid . Very clean , " Sandoval said . " He never got in trouble . He was always playing basketball , of course . He was a very outgoing type . <p> " I did n't foresee him working with kids , but I knew he would be a success . If you 're around kids as much as I am , you can really pick out the ones who will be successful . " <p> ANGELA Williams , 23 , stood beside the hardwood basketball court and watched as Kearney put the sixth-graders through one of their twice-weekly practices . It is a familiar spot for her . <p> " I used to always come in here and sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been watching since I was 5 , and Kearney and the guys always tried to get me to play . I finally got up enough nerve to play with them when I was 13 . " <p> She played on the boys ' team because at that time there was n't a girls ' league . <p> " Kearney can develop you as a player . I did n't have any skill when I started . They used to laugh at me . I shot the ball in the wrong basket against Montbello , " Williams said . <p> But Kearney did n't give up on her . He helped her develop quickly enough that as a GW freshman she played second-string varsity . <p> " I thought that was pretty good , " she said . " I went back to Kearney that summer following my freshman year . He and a guy named Bobby Williams got me good enough that I started varsity all the way through my sophomore year to my senior year . " <p> Kearney attended all her high school games except those that conflicted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated in December from the University of Texas at El Paso with a degree in journalism . She went through college on a basketball scholarship . <p> Now , she hopes to find a job that relates to her degree . But she also wants to have time to coach girls . <p> Carl Gardner already has a job that allows him to coach . He works at King Soopers and helps Kearney coach the eighth-graders . <p> " I played for Kearney , " Gardner said . " He cut me from the sixth-grade team . I left the gym crying so hard that he took me back on the team . " <p> Gardner also grew up near the center , which he called his safe haven . He moved to California and played basketball at a high school in a white suburb . <p> " With what I learned at Skyland , I was a big deal at that school , " Gardner said with a laugh . <p> This is Gardner 's first year as a coach , but Kearney gives him an almost equal voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get into game-day strategy , but he is another Skyland kid who became a Skyland adult . He works one-on-one with kids on some weekends and during his breaks from school . <p> White was an 8-year-old when he joined Skyland 's boys ' track team 20 years ago . Kearney coached the team . <p> White is a Ph.D . candidate in petroleum engineering at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro , N.M . <p> " I am away at school now , but I stay in contact with him , " White said . " He is not only your coach . He is your friend , too . " <p> IN the first seconds of the game , Skyland 's sixth-graders were out of synch . They controlled the tip-off but lost the ball when a player got mixed up and threw it toward the wrong basket . The ball went out of bounds . Sacred Heart in-bounded the ball and scored an uncontested layup . That set the tone for the first quarter . <p> Sacred Heart , the visitors , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give-and-go plays . Skyland looked slow and confused , and the first quarter ended with Sacred Heart leading 11-5 . <p> But it appeared the two coaches were watching a different game . <p> The visitors ' coach shouted angrily when his players made a mistake despite their overall good showing . During timeouts , he bellowed instructions and criticism at the players as they stood next to him . <p> Kearney takes a different approach . <p> Take , for example , this exchange that took place at the start of a game against Golden . A Golden player grabbed the tip-off and dribbled across center court . <p> Kearney yelled at his players to quickly set up their man-to-man defense . <p> But the Golden player drove around his defender and scored an easy layup . <p> Kearney stood up as the ball glanced off the backboard and into the basket in front of the Skyland bench . <p> " Whose man was that ? " he asked . <p> Noah Jefferson ran over to the front of the bench and said , " Mine , coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I went for the wrong hand , coach . " <p> ' OK . You 've got to slide in front of him . OK , you made a mistake . Now , get down there and do something good . " <p> Kearney has taught kids how to play basketball five evenings a week for 20 seasons . He also , for 20 seasons , has coached one or two sixth-grade games a week and an eighth-grade game on Saturdays . Most years he has mixed in two or three tournaments for each team . During the summer he puts on separate basketball clinics for elementary and middle school students . He also coaches a team of high school girls in a summer basketball league . The last two summers , he coached a baseball team in the Colorado Rockies youth league . <p> In the fall , he is offensive coordinator for the Pirates , a heavyweight football team that plays in the Police Athletic League . <p> That translates into a lot of kids and a lot of games , and the Golden game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night , Kearney stood on the edge of the court in Stapleton 's gym . He watched his players walk across the highly glossed floor that reflected the gym 's bright lights . The players , dressed in gold-colored uniforms , seemed to float to center court , carried above it by their potential and their dreams . <p> Just as the referee tossed the ball for the opening tip-off , Kearney quietly said , more to himself than to anyone else , " These games are really thrilling .
