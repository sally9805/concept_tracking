All week the heat has been killing . Foolish to walk the distance to the credit union even so early in the morning , imagining you can beat the worst of it . Think of the walk back , the pavement baking , not a tree for blocks . Foolish  --  Kenneth word . Do n't be foolish , Marilyn , take the Volvo . <p> This , as so often now , was her cue . The tiny , greased gear of her willfulness downshifted away from him , revving at the barest stroke of his control . Or his contempt . She was n't free to do the sensible thing  --  drive the air-conditioned car out of the cool garage to the credit union two miles away . She had to fight . Fight what ? <p> Anyway , it was good to walk . A recent article she had clipped made the point : walking was as good , even for cardiovascular , as jogging . Better , really , less threat to the joints . Kenneth was a runner he did n't like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen corkboard : Jogging Benefits Questioned . Not that Kenneth bothered to read the clippings she put up , though he could be annoyed by the sight of grocery coupons pinned there . " What are you wasting time clipping coupons for ? " he would say , walking out the back door to the garage . That shrug of disdain as he passed by . <p> Get to the credit union by eight when it opens , home by ninethirty , before the real heat of the day : this was her plan . She was n't due at the bookstore until afternoon . But already the day 's new heat was adding itself to the surplus still standing from yesterday . The night had left it all to simmer . <p> At the credit union , she pulled on the big glass door . It did n't budge . Her eye went to a white rectangle on the glass , above the handle : Weekdays 9 a.m. - 4:30 p.m . An added judgment , another cluck of contempt . Foolish , not to check the hours . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting on the low retaining wall in the shade , apparently having made the same mistake . He held a check and a green deposit slip in a meaty hand . He smiled at her in a way she recognized was harmless . How could you tell that about strangers ? Could you ? Marilyn trusted her instinct on things like this . Strange , how she bristled at Kenneth , but she still trusted the world for no good reason . <p> " Plenty of room , " the man said . He patted the low wall where he sat , and looked away , toward the state capitol and its immense greensward . She joined him on the retaining wall , ducking out of the sun . <p> She was annoyed by the hour wait  --  waste of time . Said so . Was n't this something new , the nine o'clock opening hour ? Were these temporary summer hours ? Should n't the credit union have sent out notices of any change ? " And in this heat , " she added . She expected him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than she , dressed in shorts and tee , stomach lazing over his waistband veered away from the communion of resentment . " I 'm on vacation , " he said easily , gazing off . " Might as well wait . " <p> Marilyn felt oddly annoyed , as if this fat stranger 's contentment subtly betrayed her . Foolish to be impatient . She wished she had n't settled in next to him , but it made no sense to walk back home ( plus the question of facing Kenneth ) , and this was the only shaded place to sit . <p> A woman in cutoffs , her skimpy yellow hair raked high in a painful-looking ponytail , hurried to the door in flip-flops , her child trailing behind her . She took in the sign , sighed , squinted in the direction of the flower box . No room . Her feet smacked the steps as she rushed back to her car , the child 's face impassive as a loan officer at her side . <p> Several others came by , mostly businessmen in suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweating figures frowning theatrically at their watches . Each time the plot of discovery and disap pointment looked stagier . Always , they walked off , got in their closed cars , drove away . People were becoming cartoons . Only she and the fat man sat there , waiting it out by the retaining wall , electric-blue lobelia rising from the flower boxes behind them . <p> The sharp edges of her annoyance melted , as she sat there regarding other people 's irritation . What predictable animals we are . She was going to point this out to the heavy man sitting peacefully to her right . But her observation would seem to him , she sensed , mean-spirited . He would n't like it . How did she know this  --  that he would be allergic to  --  to what ? Irony ? The basic unkindness of reading people , observing them ? He would not like judging people . That was it , he was n't a judger . He was  --  she had n't the slightest idea . But how interesting , anyway , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know these things about people . It 's the way you size up anyone , quick brush strokes of assessment you hardly know you 're making . It 's how we make our way through the day , down the street , she supposed . Glancing and judging , feinting to the left , dodging to the right . <p> She asked what he did for a living . <p> " I work for the Consolidated Bureaus , " he said . <p> What was that ? <p> A smile , sad smile : " I 'm a nasty bill collector " <p> Was it a hard job ? <p> " Well , only eight to ten percent of the bills sent to me ever get collected . Ever . Believe it . And of all the people I talk to  --  it 's a phone job  --  only five percent show any willingness to work with me on the problem . Can you believe that ? " He shook his head in mild wonder . <p> " Do they admit they owe the money ? " Marilyn asked . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " And ? " <p> " They could care less . " <p> " l suppose it makes you pretty cynical , " Marilyn said . God , what a hopeless job . <p> " You do n't trust anybody , " he said richly . But his voice gave him away , no edge to it . He was a great unflexed wad of trust . Was n't cynical , was n't bruised . He was intact . Rare sight . <p> She should not believe , however , the people on Oprah and 20/20 who told outlandish tales about bill collectors . The part about threats . " There are rules and laws , we ca n't do any of that stuff , " he said , repelled . The very idea he would menace anyone . He shifted slightly , a shiver of disgust . <p> Imagine being married to such a man . That sweet disgust at his own supposed power , rippling from the center of his soft pudding self  --  it was reliable , good . Something reassuring about disgust , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was contempt she had to contend with from Kenneth , not just the grit of his practiced will sparking against her worn-out compliance . At first ( thirty-six years !  --  their daughter was a mother twice already ) his abruptness had struck her as certainty . Impatient , yes . But the good kind of impatient-eager , ambitious , hungry . Men should be hungry . The growl of love and work , lean and hungry . She used to think that way-men are , women are . Everybody did . <p> She had been proud , secretly , to recognize that hunger in Kenneth , willing to admit that 's what she wanted . A twilight boat ride around the harbor , sponsored by their two Catholic colleges , spring , 1959 . Holding a glass of shrimp-colored punch , feeling bold , though she did nothing illicit . Thinking , calculating about him  --  that was illicit . She shrugged off , in an instant , the domesticated male virtues so prized in Father Sullivan 's Attributes of Catholic Marriage class . " Does he give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest rang out to his roomful of putative virgins . A nun , still wearing the Renaissance habit of the Order , sat at the back of the room grading papers , a sardonic eyebrow raised occasionally like a mordant punctuation mark to the old priest 's blather . The sins he had in mind were corny , middle-aged fantasies . He warned them about wife-swapping , for God 's sake . <p> The truth was , Kenneth had given her a champagne feeling , though not of well-being . Something grainier , like the dry sandiness of real champagne hitting the roof of your mouth . Even the faint sneer on Kenneth 's face had not scared her off . Had there been a sneer , even then ? She had looked up at his smooth face as he said something  --  wharf  --  something funny , something a bit unkind , a circle of people around him , crewcuts and candy-colored sweater sets . Whatever he said , it gave her the chance to tilt her face up to him , a kiss-me angle , laughing , admiring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water smoothly , then there was a shift as it turned . Her punch sloshed out of the glass , her hands got sticky . " Better watch that , " he said , smiling . Had noticed her . They were married the weekend after graduation , to no one 's surprise . They had become one of their campuses ' solid " couples " since their sophomore year . Pre-law and el ed . " Great planning , Ken , " an uncle whacked him on the back at the wedding , " she 'll get you through law school . " <p> Which Marilyn had , four years of second grade at Compton Elementary , using birth control without a qualm . None of their business , Kenneth said . He led them , with amazing nonchalance , away from the crafted certainties of their parochial background . He had no crisis of faith . It was n't spiritual , not even intellectual . He simply saw that life was elsewhere . He began growing his hair long , not crazy long , just curling over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to protest the draft . But they threw nothing , not rocks , not blood . They did not get arrested . He was Law Review , clerked for a state supreme court justice . Good firm , some teaching . Then the children , just two , a girl , then a boy . <p> By the time the children were in school , Marilyn did n't want to go back to teaching , cramming down a damp sandwich in the staff room choked with smoke , the pent-up aura of captives in the corridors , mayhem roaring from the lunchroom . Motherhood spoiled her . It was orderly  --  to her surprise . Days alone , doing little things , one after another . Reading books to the children , their small fingers pointing : Train , elephant ! Giraffe , giraffe , giraffe ! <p> She opened a bookstore with the mother of another boy in her son 's Montessori class . Children 's books and educational games . Now the place , Charlotte 's Web , was hers . She 'd bought out her partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good . Kenneth was impressed . She had been approached about opening a second store in a mall , books , interactive multimedia products , a whole area devoted to hands-on computers . The computer stations for the new store reminded her of the hi-fi booths of her high-school years , where you could go and listen to a record to see if you wanted to buy it . Sit in the little confessionbox-size glass booth , headset clamped on like earmuffs , melting into Johnny Mathis . <p> She stared off at the green shimmer of the capitol grounds across the avenue from the credit union . Was it Johnny Mathis who had sung " Moon River " ? Audrey Hepburn was dead . Marilyn had cried , actually sobbed , alone , looking at the pictures in People magazine . My era . <p> " I was sitting here before you arrived , " the bill collector said , as if they had been carrying on a conversation  --  had they ? had she missed something ?  --  " and I was watching that man on the mower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how he runs that thing . " <p> Marilyn looked across at the figure on the mower . <p> I 've been watching him really close  --  no hand levers , nothing with his feet . I ca n't figure it out . He just sits on it , and it goes on its own . " Fascinated by the likelihood of magic at work , voice rippling with awe . " Do you see anything ? " <p> " No , I do n't , " Marilyn said . " He just seems to go . " <p> " That 's what I 'm thinking , " the man said . <p> This thought seemed to connect him to many other thoughts . There is absolutely no point , for example , he said , in attempting to collect a bill during the full moon : people are nuts during the full moon . Ditto during the twelve-year period when he managed a skating rink : he always hired extra security on full-moon nights . The kids were nuts then , too . Possessed . More murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More everything . <p> He expressed no irritation at the feckless and sometimes evil ways of the world . Apparently he lived in a state of astonishment . <p> From the full moon to astrology . He was a Taurus . Again the amazement of it all : most of his family were Gemini or Cancer-he had no idea why he was a Taurus . An unbidden mystery boring out of the core of his identity . There was meaning in all this . Believe it . <p> He also wondered why  --  as a Capitol Patrol car went by  --  there were city police and capitol police . Was n't that a waste of money , an overlap ? Marilyn mentioned the existence of the university police , another doubling of duty . Maybe there was a value in having this extra protection in sensitive areas ? He thought that over , agreed . " There are lots of chemicals sitting around at the university , " he said . " Things can blow up . " <p> " The university , " he repeated , as if pondering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know well in the last year . Was n't it incredible , the labyrinth of corridors at University Hospital , the confusion of the place for the non-university person thrust suddenly into that maze ? Take himself . He 'd gone there every day for months and months . Never figured the place out . Pause . " My brother was a patient there . " <p> They were turning a dark corner , she sensed . <p> The brother was big in astrology , Tarot , all that . He had come home from California for a family visit , had read their father 's cards . He told his brother that the father would be dead before Christmas . But it was himself who was gone before Christmas . Just six months ago . " He read his own cards , " the bill collector said , something like reverence in his voice . " The one thing you can not do is read your own cards . But you can read your own fate in another person 's cards . You do n't even know it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than he wanted to know , too . He stayed away from the cards now . <p> He turned abruptly from the occult , steered them toward his amazing four-year-old . This boy liked his cooking better than his wife 's . Why ? Because it was spicier . Imagine : a four-year-old who loves spicy food , really spicy , like an adult . Incredible , but true . <p> So many amazing facts . Flowers can grow out of sheer rock , you saw that a lot along Lake Superior where he , the wife , and the boy were going for the week , as soon as he deposited his check . Or the oddity of sundogs , and the fact that a significant percentage of the population does not believe we ever landed on the moon . Some pretty interesting arguments , you know ? His brother had a book on it . Also , he and his brother had once seen a funnel cloud twirling along 61 North . The amazing thing ? It looked just the way you always heard they looked : absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touching down , and then , for no reason , up and off again . He leaned back against the flower boxes . Weather was really weird . <p> Not to mention the host of unpaid bills all about us , the carelessness of people . " They say , ' Fuck you , ' just llke that , and slam the phone down , " he said , marveling , not insulted . <p> Then there 's the big one , Big D. The sudden disappearance of blood relatives , their unbelievable dematerialization . You keep seeing people who look just like them . Or rather , you start seeing people who look just like them , the backs of heads . You never noticed that before , not till he passed away , was gone . Then he seemed to be everywhere . " My brother was younger than me , " he said , " but he goes first . They say , ' Expect the unexpected . ' It 's easy to forget that . " Blue lobelia appeared to sprout from his shoulders where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating up . The humidity felt intentional , vicious , needling away at the air . It would be another heavy day to live through . <p> The bill collector was n't looking at Marilyn . He just gazed out , kept talking , seeing things . Galena , Illinois , used to be located on the banks of the Mississippi River , but no longer is . You see , a river is not a straight line between banks . It 's a whole system , and you do n't know where it starts or stops , what space it really takes up . They make a big deal about finding the source of the Mississippi . That 's dumb . The Indians laughed at that . There is n't really a source . It 's a big muddle up there . They just choose this stream or that , call it " the source . " You do n't know . What you see is not what you got . Nor are you necessarily safe from earthquakes just because you live in the Midwest . Remember that little town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , not a berry . Raisins are really former grapes , shriveled up  --  but he bet she knew that one already . <p> The bill collector 's voice wheeled through the heat , his marvels believable and meaningless at once , lovely harmlessnesses making the world work , gears in a great engine carrying us over the rough patches . The grass across the avenue on the capitol greensward had been watered earlier in the morning from jets buried in the ground . Now the green gave off a low weather system , a minute fog just above itself , tiny rainbows evaporating by the minute as the heat burned them into the day . <p> The man on the riding mower worked the grass like a tidy quarter section of alfalfa , without lever or foot pedal , hands visible on the steering wheel , but no sign of where the energy came from . Something at the knee ? Marilyn 's eyes shut a quick instant against the disloyal thought . It was too far to see now , anyway . Who knows ? <p> A gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner . Kenneth coming to get her . He pulled up near the sidewalk , the tires making the watery sound of tires slowing on dry pavement . He leaned across the seat toward the passenger window so she could see him beckoning . His face was filmy behind the gleam of the rolled-up window . And now you see darkly , but then face w face . But when , when do you see someone face to face ? Not in this life . Was he smiling ?  --  she thought he was smiling . A good smile . Concern there . She could make out a hand , gesturing . He wanted her to be out of the heat . Oh , and safe . He worries . Always has . Sees trouble . It 's what he thinks imagination is for  --  worrying . Remember the first time ? " I 'll always protect you "  --  the little patch of movie dialogue , the champagne of well-being , the two of them meeting the length of their pure bodies for the first time , crazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I blanked out on the neon sign . Star Mote . Looking for trouble , the sweet , safe kind , a month before the wedding . I 'll always protect you . <p> Soon , the big glass door will open . But not yet . Kenneth must wait , just a sec , honey . She must stay here in the shade , the lobelia gushing over the cinder blocks . The fat stranger keeps talking , listing all the unlikely things that happen , that just are . She does n't move . She will go to the Volvo in a moment , explain it all . But for now , this extra instant , she stays put , here in the killing heat . She wants to look straight ahead at nothing for another minute , wants to keep listening to the bill collector , who , still in mourning , is describing the world as the wonder it must be . <p> <p> By PATRICIA HAMPL <p>                    @
