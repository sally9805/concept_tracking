The River <p> I 'll admit I picked Ecuador for its symbolic possibilities . I wanted a place where things were reliable : twelve hours of darkness , twelve hours of light . It was the end of the old year , two weeks before my thirty-third birthday , the age my Catholic friend Tony said all things would be revealed to me . Thirty-two 's highlights included three busted friendships , two bogus photography assignments , and a lover turned stalker . I was n't holding my breath . <p> Balance , I thought . New Year 's Eve at the equator . I called every magazine I 'd ever shot for until somebody paid me to go . <p> My guide 's name was Renato , and he was Catholic , too , sweet and serious , a broken-in Pittsburgh Pirates cap on his head , fresh out of guide school , and looking for plants to identify , rare butterflies , tropical birds . <p> First Renato took me to Mount Cayambe , a hairsbreadth short of nineteen thousand feet above sea level , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice caps and snow . <p> " This is the highest point on earth along the equator , " Renato said , " and the only place in the world where the latitude and the temperature reach zero degrees simultaneously . " <p> I framed Cayambe in my camera and snapped the shutter . Renato and I were going to get along fine . <p> Renato said he would take me to the north coast to see the remains of the ancient culture of Agua Blanca , to the Isla de la Plata to see the blue-footed boobies , to the cloud forests near Mindo to see the Atta ants by the hundreds of thousands , each one carrying a piece of a leaf over its head like a parasol . <p> I told him I wanted to lay my eyes on the Amazon Basin , wanted to feel her dark waters underneath me , figured she might have something to tell me that I needed to know . <p> " The jungle is a magic place , " Renato said , " like a temple . We will waste the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ca n't be too soon , " I said . " Not for me . " <p> " Going straight from your America to the jungle , " he said , " is like going from the brightest sunlight into the darkest cave . If you do n't take time to adjust your vision , it does n't matter what the cave holds for you , you will never be able to see . " <p> The rivers had been my place once , Colorado Plateau rivers that tumbled through the Sawatch and the San Juan mountains , that carved through deserts of slickrock and sand . But I hung up my oar blades over a year before , moved myself to a city next to an ocean , saying , Water is water , as I drove toward the coast . I traded in my life jacket for halogen sensor lights and an electric garage door opener , told myself that one life story was as good as the next . <p> I thought if I went to enough art museums and unrated movies , I 'd stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day has brought a foot of snow down from the highest peaks and I 'm lying in my sleeping bag beside it , listening to the boulders roll . <p> I 'd heard , too , that city men were different , that I might find one there who read books and cooked with spices and did n't save all his passion for class-five rapids and narrows and chutes . What I found when I got there was the same man with different excuses , enough rancor in him to bring me to my knees . <p> I 'd sworn off the whole species for a while after that , at least till I knew how to pick one better . When I went to Ecuador , I had n't had anything resembling a date in six months . <p> I had an idea in my head about going home for the first time to the biggest river system of them all , more massive than all the Colorado Plateau rivers I 'd been on at high-water put together and then some , a river as thick with life as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce . I wanted to remember what it was like to float down something that would n't try to swallow me . I wanted to see if after a yearlong flirtation with tidal pools and breakers , Big Mama River would take me back in . <p> " I will take you first , " Renato said , " to the river of riches , Aguarico , which flows into the Napo , which picks up the Curaray , and then becomes the Amazon that you see on the maps . But you must understand it is all the Amazon , in the same way that every part of the cow is beef . " <p> " I do understand , " I said . " I told you I know about rivers . " <p> " I will take you to the Lagarto , " he said , " to Imuya , the place of the howler monkeys . " He fingered the bill of his ball cap . " I will take you , " he said , " to the Filet Mignon . " <p> But first we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez , where we ate ceviche for lunch and dinner and slept in windowless rooms above the Spondylous Bar . We drank pitchers of Caipirina , made from vodka , sugar , and lemon , listened to the music of Eros Ramazotti and Franco De Vida on old vinyl disks . Renato taught me how to dance salsa , cumbia , and ballinato , and when the music allowed it , which was n't often , I taught him how to country swing . <p> The bar was run by three Colombians-Alberto , Abel , and Jimez-three of Peter Pan 's lost boys who danced all night with the local girls and swam in the ocean all day . I was the first tourist in the bar since the end of October , and they went out of their way to show their appreciation , to make me feel at home . <p> " Woodstock , " Abel , who knew no English , said , pulling another battered album from behind the counter . " Eric Clapton , Crosby , Stills &; Nash . " He pronounced each syllable like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " Steppenwolf , the Byrds . " Jimez traded me my belt buckle for his switchblade . I was the only one Alberto had permission to dance with other than his wife . <p> " There are 3,800 vertebrates in Ecuador , " Renato said , after our third pitcher of Caipirina , " 1,55o birds , 40o reptiles , 2,500 fish , over a million insect species , 25 , ooo varieties of vascular plants . " <p> " Biodiversity , " I said . " Do you know that word ? " <p> " Of course , " he said , and frowned a little . He always said of course when the answer was no . <p> The next day we went by boat to the Isla de la Plata to see the nests of the blue- and red-footed boobies , the flight pattern of the frigate and tropic birds , and a crab called Sally Lightfoot , who made her ghostly way across the beach 's rocky dividers and ran across the surface of the water like Jesus when the tide came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " pretty and smart . Why do you come to Ecuador without . . . someone . " <p> " How I ca n't get that right , " I said , " is almost uncanny . " I saw the frown crease his brow . " Do you know that word ? " <p> " Of course , " he said . <p> We watched the sea urchins wave their spiny selves back and forth in a tidal pool . <p> " In the Amazon , " Renato said , " there is a tiny catfish called a candiru that will swim right into a man 's penis , and lodge itself there by erecting sharp spines . " <p> " And you are telling me this . " <p> " To amuse you , " he said , " to give you something to wish on all those bad men . " He held out a picture of a dark-haired woman holding a child . " Anyway , " he said , " it amuses my wife . " <p> " She 's lovely " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the picture . " So I can swim in the river , then , worry-free . " <p> " Yes , " he said . " Except for the piranha. . . and the six hundred volts of electric eel . ' <p> " You wo n't scare me off the Amazon , " I said , " so do n't even try . " <p> " I want to go there even more than you do , " he said . " But you must n't think it is all pretty birds and lily pads . There are things that will hurt you there , like here , " he said , and a stingray jumped from the water as if in service of his words . <p> " Like everywhere , " I said . " It is n't paradise : ' <p> " That 's where you 're wrong , " Renato said . " It is paradise . " He shook his head . " Is this what they tell you in your America , " he said , " that paradise is a place without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carmita has something very special for you to eat . " <p> " Steak ? " I said , because I knew that was his favorite . <p> " Only in your country , " he said , " do they eat steak near the ocean . This is better than steak . You wait and see : ' <p> We were back from our boat trip , sitting on the porch of the town 's only restaurant , watching Alberto and Abel run into the water with inflatable rafts and ride the small waves back onto the beach , their skin glistening with salt water , their hair slicked smooth and black . They tumbled together like porpoises , like harbor seals , laughing like creatures born in the sea . <p> " They are amphibious , those boys , " I said to Renato . " Do you know that word ? " <p> " Of course , " he said . <p> " Like the grand cayman , " I said , and snapped my arms together like jaws . <p> " Amphibious ; ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for later . <p> The sun hovered on the horizon , unsure whether or not to set . Abel ran up the beach and made his hands into a megaphone ; " Blood , Sweat &; Tears , " he called out , " Procol Harum . " <p> I gave him the thumbs up . <p> " In my America , " I told Renato , " there is more light in the summer than there is in winter . The days are shorter now than they are in June . " <p> He squinted his eyes first at me and then at the sunset . " I think , " he said , " that this is not possible . " <p> " No , " I said , " it is . In Alaska , in fact , there is a town called Point Barrow that is so close to the North Pole that the sun goes down one day in November and it does n't rise again until February 1st . " <p> " You have seen this place ? " he said . <p> I shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is so . " <p> " I do know , " I said , " because it happens where I live , too , just not as dramatically . In the summer , our days are fifteen hours . In the winter , they are only eight or nine . " <p> " No , " he said , shaking his head , frowning , " It is not as you say . " <p> " It is n't something I made up , " I said . " There are reasons for it . . . theories . " <p> " I do not know these theories , " he said . <p> " Then you have to take my word for it , " I told him , " until you go and see for yourself . " <p> Carmita 's husband came to the table and set a plate in front of us covered with something that looked a lot like the creature from Little Shop of Horrors . A crusty brown body with no head and a dozen gray spongy legs , all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said proudly . " You must have cajones to catch them . Do you know this word cajones ? " <p> " Oh yes , " I said . <p> " It is mucho dangerous , " he said . " The percebes live in the place where all day long the ocean pounds into the rock . " He slapped his left hand against his right palm , hard . <p> When he 'd gone back to the kitchen , I picked the thing off the plate by its largest claw , let the body and the other claws dangle . <p> " This is a test , " I said , " to see if I 'm ready for the Amazon . " Renato smiled . " It is not a test , " he said . " It is a delicacy . " <p> " Okay , " I said , " then you take the first bite . " <p> On our last morning in Puerto Lopez , I woke up to find the balcony next to the Spondylous covered with ier-mache heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-haired , some brown , some male , some female , some pink-skinned , some brown-skinned , some mustachioed , some with glasses ; a whole town full of people cut off at the necks and stuck on wooden pegs nailed to the balcony 's rail . <p> Renato came outside to find me in the street taking pictures . <p> " On New Year 's Eve , " Renato said , " Ecuadorians burn life-size puppets in the street . . loved ones who have died , failed politicians , sports heroes who have let us down . " <p> The biggest pig I 'd ever seen in person was making his way toward us on the street . <p> " It is not a happy new year , like it is in your America , " Renato said . " On New Year 's Eve , we are crying . On January ist we are happy again . " <p> The pig walked right up to me , rubbed its bristly hair against my bare leg . <p> " We will be in Quito on New Year 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned , even George Bush , even Lorena Bobbitt . ' He scratched the pig behind the ears , and it made a noise like a cat purring . <p> " Perhaps , " he said , " you should make a puppet or two of your own . " <p> On the way back to Quito , we stopped first at Agua Blanca , where excavation had begun on the ruins of a culture that thrived in 500 A.D. and whose people are remembered first , Renato said , for trying to become more beautiful by deforming their skulls and removing their teeth . <p> From a boy on the street , I bought a necklace of tiny clay human figures , half of them pregnant , the rest of them men , turned on . <p> Then we went to Mindo , and got the van stuck in the cloud forest mud along the side of the road . While Renato dug with the shovel , I walked two miles to town , drank a cerveza with the local boys while the bartender ran around trying to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , the bar crowd pulled us out with an ox so thin , his rib cage looked like a weapon . That night we stayed in the Hostelria El Bijou for a dollar per person . The rooms had mosquito netting , and not much else . <p> I was watching the biggest spider I 'd ever seen in my life systematically devour giant mosquitoes by candlelight when Renato knocked on my door . <p> " How 's your netting ? " he said . <p> " Absolutely nothing bigger than a small dog will get through , " I said , sticking my head through one of the bigger holes to smile at him . <p> " Mine 's no better , " he said , " or I 'd trade . Did you hear them say there is no water ? " " To drink ? " I said . <p> " To drink , to flush , to wash your hands . " He started to close the door . " I 'm sorry about this , Lucy " he said . " We should be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine . " <p> " But I 'm getting extra credit for this , " I said , " are n't I ? " <p> " Two days in Quito , " he said , " and the Amazon is yours . " <p> In Quito he took me to the Church of the Basilica , where all the gargoyles were water creatures : turtles , iguanas , dolphins , and snakes . <p> " No percebes , " I said , pointing to the decorated buttresses . <p> " As you can see , the church has not been completed , " he said . " They obviously have n't gotten to the percebes spire yet : ' <p> Inside , the altar was decorated with coral and sea stars and mother of pearl . The bells pealed in loud , rapid halftones , a gentle waterfall reaching the sea . <p> " For the people of my country , " Renato said , " water is everything : love , life , religion . . . even God . " <p> " It is like that for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that a metaphor . " <p> " Of course , " said Renato , " and water is the most abundant metaphor on earth . " <p> Outside my window in downtown Quito , a hundred thousand people were burning puppets in the street . Renato had gone home at ten p.m. to be with his family . It was the first time I 'd been alone in nearly a week . <p> " Happy New Year , " I said when Tony answered . <p> " Where the hell are you this time ? " he said . <p> " You have to guess , " I said , " but I 'll give you good hints . " <p> Tony and I had been friends for years , lovers one brief weekend in the middle of them . He was a triathlete , and he read poetry ; to my friends , I called him the most beautiful man in the world . <p> " Australia , " he said , after two hints ; " Thailand , " he said after a third . <p> He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met him ; his sobriety day the same as my birthday : January 8th . He told me once that New Year 's Eve was the most difficult day on his calendar . I called him each year , from wherever I was . <p> Ecuador was his fifth guess ; the clue : " Here it 's the equinox , every single day . " <p> He said , " Lucy , I want you to stop in Ann Arbor and see me on your way home . We 've never been together when we 're both single . We ought to do it this time , see what we 've got . " <p> I felt the last lonely six months change in my head from an eternity to an instant . I counted all the ways Tony was different from the others . <p> " It 's your day , angel , and mine , too , " he said . " I want to show you my house , want you to meet my great new dog . Let 's lavish a little affection on each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you say ? " <p> The distance hummed in the line between us . " Did you say ravish ? " I said . <p> " Yeah , " Tony said , laughing his easy laugh . " That , too . " <p> " I 'm going to the Amazon in the morning " I said . " I might not be able to change my plane . " <p> " Just try , " he said . " I can feel it this time , Lucy , it might just be our year . <p> I walked out into the streets , where heaps of half-burned puppets and garbage smoldered . It was only a few minutes after twelve , but the city was deserted . All the Ecuadorians had gone home to have a midnight feast with their families . The only people left on the street were the foreigners , the homeless , and me . <p> An old woman in rags handed me a shot of something that tasted like rotten peaches and made my head spin right after it went down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Across the flame I saw another woman sobbing , holding her sides . <p> I went back inside and called the airlines . It cost six hundred dollars to make the change . <p> Renato and I raced down the Rio Aguarico all day in a speed boat to get to a camp called Zancudo-mosquito in Spanishthat doubled as a border base for the Ecuadorian army . The Peruvian army was stationed on the opposite bank , not a hundred yards downstream . <p> " When we are not at war with Peru , " Renato said , " we play football with them on Sunday . But now we are at war , so you may hear gunfire in the night . " <p> He was walking me to my cabin , making sure I could find the bathroom in the dark . <p> " We have an informal agreement with the Peruvians not to aim at the tourist cabins , " he said , " but I would n't sleep in the window bunk , even so . " <p> When the shots came loud and close and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sprung awake so fast I nearly hanged myself in my mosquito net . I hit the floor and crawled under my bed , pulling the netting down with me . There were five or six more rounds of gunfire ; then the night went silent again . <p> The next morning we took a canoe with an outboard motor farther down the Aguarico and made a hard left turn up the Lagarto River , which was smaller and clear and the color of weak coffee . Everything else , from the banks of the river to the top of the canopy , was a rich and relentless green . Jungle sounds were all around us , the wild music of lunatic birds . <p> " Today we go to Imuya camp , " Renato said . " Imuya means place of the howler monkeys in the language of the people who have always lived here . " <p> " Will we see them ? " I said . <p> " We will see all manner of monkeys today , " Renato said , " spider , woolly , titi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one ever sees the howler monkeys . But when they call , you can hear them from five miles away . " <p> We saw a flash of pink just under the surface of the water , and then again just above . <p> " Pink-bellied river dolphins , " Renato said and shut the motor off . " You can swim with them if you want . " <p> One dolphin surfaced and rolled over slowly . The skin on his back was brown tinged with pink , the same color as the boys from the Spondylous Bar . <p> I slipped over the side of the boat and into the water . <p> " They are shy , you know , " he said . " It wo n't be like . . . ' <p> " Flipper , " I said . <p> " Yes , " he said , laughing , " that 's right . " <p> The water was warm and turned my skin chocolate . The dolphins made big arcs , keeping their eyes on me from some distance away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder . <p> " Stay away from the edges , " he said . " There are cayman , fer-delance , water moccasins. . . did I tell you about the candiru ? " <p> " Yes , " I said , " and do n't tell me again . " <p> We walked the two-mile boardwalk across the floating rain forest to Lake Imuya carrying our gear , our water , our food . The jungle around us was thick and green and brimming with life sounds , teeming with them . Every time we took a step off the boardwalk , I thought , I am killing at least a thousand different species at one time . <p> When we got to the lake , two Siona Indians , Rojillio and Lorenzo , were waiting in a rough-hewn canoe , hand-carved from a single tropical tree . Renato puffed out his chest , carried his load a little higher . <p> " You will take my picture with Rojillio , " he said , and I did . " He is a wise man , " Renato said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Renato sat in the very front of the canoe , then Lorenzo with a paddle , then me . Rojillio sat in the very back , holding the big paddle he used to steer . Rojillio spoke in a language that was not quite Spanish . Lorenzo grinned , started to laugh . <p> " He says the last few days they have seen a grand cayman near here , " Renato said . " Thirteen feet long . He says she may have babies , He says we must n't make her mad . " <p> Rojillio made a noise in his throat three times , a low guttural croaking like a frog . Lorenzo giggled again , but soft this time , like a breeze . <p> " That is the noise ; " Renato said , " of the baby cayman . " <p> Rojillio made the sound again , did n't even get to the third croak when the big cayman 's head popped up above the surface of the water . <p> " There , " Lorenzo said , his first English word spoken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a couple of shots . She was coming toward us slowly , toward the front of the canoe , not making even a ripple in the water , her eye fixed , it seemed , only on Renato . <p> She came closer and closer , till I had to back off from my zoom to get anything but her eye in the shot . <p> I backed it off as far as it would go , realized in that split second that the lens distance had met reality , dropped my camera to my chest just in time to see the cayman rear up and out of the water , propelled by the muscle that was her tail like nothing I 'd ever seen before and silent . Her two front legs and eight or nine feet of her thirteen-foot body were in the front of the canoe , and she was snapping her three-foot-long jaws hard at Renato . <p> Rojillio barked out a command that in any language could only have been " Do n't fall into the water , " and Renato made a move around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow not in it , prettier than a wide receiver with the goal line in his sights . <p> The cayman stretched her neck at Lorenzo and Renato , who were now more or less both in my lap , and we all high-sided to keep the boat from tipping toward the cayman , till she got tired of the balancing act and slipped back down into the water . <p> Her head stayed above it , though , her one eye fixed on me this time , so close I could have scratched her head without extending my elbow . <p> For several minutes we floated that way in the dead silence of Imuya 's high noon . Then Lorenzo took his paddle and put it in the water as smooth as a spoon in fresh whipped cream , and pushed us , just slightly , away from the cayman . <p> We were twenty yards past her when Lorenzo and Rojillio exploded into laugher . Renato smiled , but I could see he was still shaking bad . <p> " In guide school , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Later that day I took Renato 's photo with his head inside the jaws of a skeletal cayman , the camp 's biggest trophy , nowhere near the size of the one that had jumped in our boat . <p> " I keep thinking , " Renato said , " of my wife , my son , my mother , how they would be feeling right now if things had gone the other way . " <p> He scraped a speck of dirt off one of the teeth of the cayman with his nail . I stared off the dock down into the dark water , then up into the thick canopy of green above . A tree frog dropped from a branch onto my upturned neck , and I brushed it away without so much as a squeal . <p> " It must be strange for you , as well " he said , " to think that no one would be grieving . " <p> " It 's not quite as bad as all that , " I said . " I do have friends . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone is unnatural . Look around you . " He motioned to the trees above us , the lake below .

" Is the entire animal community at your beck and call ? " <p> " No , " he said , " I am at theirs . " <p> " Besides , " I said , " finding a mate is no problem ; finding a good one is where I go wrong . I guess I 'm a little fussier than a scarlet macaw . <p> " And why do you think she is not fussy ; " he said , " just because she knows how to choose better than you . " <p> Something big crashed in the water , and Renato flinched more than he wanted to . <p> " Why have n't you been paying attention ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why have n't your rivers taught you how to live ? " <p> I thought about the rivers I 'd left behind in my America , remembered their golden mornings , the delicate surprise of a midsummer frost . I remembered how from above the desert , rivers gleamed like emerald necklaces , the only green for hundreds of miles of driest buttes and steepest mesas , of broken rocks and blowing sand . I remembered thinking that if the Amazon were flat and green , it would have no way to hurt me . I had forgotten the first lesson I ever learned on the river : the place that makes you vulnerable is the place that makes you strong . <p> Just then we heard a sound like the wind through a culvert on the coldest day of an inner-city winter , though the temperature in Imuya could n't have been much under a hundred degrees . It was the most hollow , the saddest , the loneliest sound I 'd ever heard . <p> Renato motioned with his head to the rope ladder , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound was louder up there , but the trees were n't moving . Even the top of the canopy was still as the first breath of dawn . <p> " It is the howler monkeys , " Renato said , " calling from four , maybe five miles up river . " <p> " It 's the wind , " I said . " An animal could never make that sound . " <p> " It is the monkeys , " he said , " and they are no bigger than wellfed parrots . " He held his hands together to indicate their size . He said , " I told you the jungle is a magical place . " <p> " How do you know it is not the wind , " I said , " if no one ever sees the monkeys ? " <p> " It is like your three months of night in Alaska , " he said .

Nor was he at baggage claim , nor in the parking lot , nor in his office , nor on his cellular phone . <p> After two hours I called my friend Henry in Chicago because he was in the next time zone and that was as close to human contact as I was going to get after midnight . <p> " You 've come all the way today from a different hemisphere , " he said .

" <p> In the car on the way to the airport , Tony said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around at any moment " <p> I looked out the window at the frozen trees , the branches heavy with icicles ready to snap . <p> " I would probably do the same thing you are doing ; ' he said . " Of course later I 'd feel like a total jerk . " <p> Lesson #1 <p> " Monarch butterflies , " Renato had said on our first day in Imuya , " make blue jays throw up . That is how monarch butterflies keep from being eaten . But over the years , by a process known as Batesian Mimicry , several other butterfly species have learned how to color themselves to look like the monarch every time a blue jay comes around . <p> " The problem arises , " Renato said , " when a blue jay 's first experience is with an impostor butterfly . If the blue jay does n't throw up that first time , he will spend the rest of his life not knowing which are the safe butterflies and which are the ones that will make him sick . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again de-iced the plane . <p> " Whoever the hell he was , " a voice said above me , " I 'd bet my front teeth he was n't worth it . " She was small and black and sexy , stuffing her bag in the overhead bin above me and pulling her skirt down , adjusting her thirty or forty gold rings . <p> " Ecuador , " she said , eyeing the tag on my carry-on . " Now there 's a place I 've always wanted to go . " <p> " I just got back , " I said . <p> " And the guy , " she said . " Was he in Ecuador ? " <p> " No , " I said , " Ann Arbor . " <p> " Well , " she said , " if you 'll excuse the expression , then fuck that shit . " <p> She settled in next to me , stuck out her hand . " My name 's Charisma . " she said . " What 's yours ? " <p> " Lucy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , let me ask you something , Lucy O'Rourke , do you know where I 'm going tonight ? " <p> " Oakland , I guess , " I said , " if you 're on the right plane . " <p> " That 's right , " she said . " That 's where my ex lives . . my first ex . . . God knows where the second one is . but the first one called me up last week and said , Charisma .... you just fly yourself out here and bring an empty suitcase cause we 're going shopping : That , my girl , is what to look for in a man . " <p> A boy of eighteen or nineteen paused in the aisle beside us , held up his ticket , shrugged , said to Charisma , " I think you 're in my seat . " <p> " Another pick of the litter , " she said , and then to the boy , " This is a great big plane , darlin , I know you can find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting his weight from seatward to backward , then he moved on . <p> Charisma said she was a writer , and a painter , and she ran an antique store her third husband bought her , and she also sang on weekends in a Detroit club , blues and a little jazz , though I could n't tell which thing she did for pay . <p> " Do you write novels ? " I said . <p> " Novels , lord no , " she said . " I ca n't even stay married . " She pulled out a nail file , scissors , polish , decals of tiny gold stars . <p> " Now you tell me all about Ecuador or the man in Ann Arbor , " she said , " whichever you need to talk about more . " <p> When I got home there was a phone message from Steven , a carpenter turned massage therapist and tantra expert I 'd met back in the summer , when I 'd sat in Oakland 's Cafe Roma drinking my first macchiattos and looking for friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman who he said was so uptight she would n't talk about her bowel movements . Going to India for two years , he said , had forever changed his life . <p> He said that if Capricorns would only embrace their goatish nature , they could be the most successful people on earth . He said Mercury was coming out of retrograde soon , and then everybody 's problems would be solved . <p> I had n't heard from Steven since that day , but he had remembered my birthday all that time , had called to see if he could take me out . I looked at the pile of bills and the empty refrigerator , took a shower , and called him back . <p> He took me out for sushi , said that because it was raw and because it was art , it was food in its purest form . I drank enough sake to choke down even the flying fish eggs , even the shrimp heads . He said there was no bad karma with sake as long as you drank it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sides of my couch , he gave me a coupon book for five free massages . He told me about his family , his Mormon roots , the years he spent on the Big Island , how he and his second wife took sex to such an art form that sometimes the neighbors came by to watch . <p> Then he said , " I think I 'd like to give you a big birthday kiss . " <p> " That would be nice , " I said . <p> When we were finished , he said , " That was a little bigger than I anticipated . " <p> " Oh , " I said , " I 'm sorry . " <p> Then he said , " Tell me something , Lucy , have you ever thought about you and me having sex ? " <p> " No , " I said , because I had n't , and I did n't tell him the rest of it , that I had n't thought of him at all since that day at Cafe Roma when we met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think about it now . " <p> I fingered the coupon book and tried to imagine it ; I thought about his Hawaiian neighbors , how I did n't even know what tantra was . <p> " Well , " I said , " It 's been a lovely evening .. . and I feel like we 're becoming friends , and everybody says that 's the place sex should come from ... " His eyes would n't let mine wander . He nodded like he hoped there was more . " I do have a kind of a passion for men who can build things , " I said , " and I know you can , though you do n't anymore . " <p> " But I could . . . , " he said , " if we were together and there was something you wanted . " <p> " So I guess , " I said , " it might be nice , it being my birthday and all . " <p> Steven lifted his hand off the place it had fallen , between our knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " And what do you think , then , " I finally said , " about you and I getting together . " <p> " Well , frankly , " he said , drawing a big cleansing breath , " I just do n't think you are spiritually advanced enough for me . " <p> Lesson #2 <p> On the second day in Imuya , we saw all the hummingbirds : the green-tailed golden throat , the fawn-breasted brilliant , the amethyst-throated sun angel , the spangled coquette . <p> " The spangled coquette , " Renato had said , " got its name because the males of the species are pugnacious and territorial and they wo n't let the females get close to the flowers to drink the nectar they need in order to live . So the female has learned to go into a false heat , a false blush of her mating colors . When the male hummingbird sees her , he becomes very generous , he lets the female eat whatever she wants . When she has stuffed herself sufficiently , the female hummingbird turns dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my birthday I broke down and picked up a copy of the Bay Guardian just to look , I said , through the personal ads . After spending the better part of the night reading them , I settled on a man named Mitchell Wagner whose ad was benign and funny , focusing mostly on his six-year-old son . <p> We made a date for the following Friday-Mitchell , me , and Willy , dinner at his house , trout with lemon and parsley , broccoli , potatoes , and German chocolate cake for dessert . <p> I negotiated the six-year-old well , I thought , watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs with him , and played teepee under the table until my back was sore . <p> Mitchell fired one question after another at me : what was the best and the worst thing about me , what was the character of the last three men I dated , where did I expect to be living in five years , and in ten . <p> In between questions he talked about his ex-wife , her addictions , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , taken Willy with him , got ready for the police or the FBI to find him , for the investigation that never came . <p> " She did n't even call my friends to see what had happened , " he said , " not even my mother : ' He moved his hand around Willy 's head in giant circles . " I mean , does that sound like natural motherhood to you ? " <p> " No , " I said , though I knew nothing about motherhood , natural or otherwise . <p> " You would n't ever pull a stunt like that , " he said , " would you ? " and his eyes got narrow like he was expecting me to lie . <p> " No , " I said , " I ca n't imagine . " <p> " You know , " he said , when I told him it was time I should be leaving , " I was going to say this to your answering machine , but after some reconsideration , I think I 'll say it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm of the couch . <p> " Never before , " he said , " have I spent three hours with anyone who took less of an interest in me . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said , " It was all I could do to .. " - keep up with the questions , is what I was going to say , but then he had his hands around my neck in something I at first believed was strangulation , and only later , when his tongue went down my throat , understood to be a kiss . <p> " I 'm having a hard time , " I said , backing to the door , grabbing my purse as I moved down the landing , " keeping up with the turns this evening has taken . " I moved my eyes back and forth between Mitchell and Willy . " Thanks for dinner , " I said . <p> Willy made tiny fists at me inside his too-big pajamas , and said a soft " Bye-bye . " <p> Lesson #3 <p> " The loudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third day , " is known as the screaming pehah . ' <p> He stuck two fingers in his mouth and made a sound indistinguishable from a wolf whistle on a construction site . A few seconds later , the bird answered back , almost as loud . <p> " The screaming pehah is an interesting bird , " Renato said , " because he spends over seventy-five percent of his life looking for a mate . " <p> " Not like anybody else we know , " I said . Either Renato did n't hear me or he decided not to smile . <p> " And the reason he has to scream so loud , " he said , " is because he is just a plain bird , small and brown .. . and living in this jungle with so many beautiful birds-blue and yellow parrots , rubythroated hummingbirds , scarlet macaws-he knows he is made superior only by his scream . " <p> The phone rang at two a.m. , and it was Mitchell Wagner . <p> " I ca n't stop thinking about you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half whisper . " In one night you 've changed everything I 'd come to believe about women . <p> " I do n't know what to say , " I said . <p> " Say you 'll see me again , " he said . " Say you 'll come for dinner tomorrow . " <p> " No , " I said , " never , " and hung up the phone . <p> Long before daylight , the phone rang again . <p> " Darling , " the voice said , " this here 's Charisma . I was just calling to see if you 're feeling as beautiful as you are today . " <p> " Yes , " I said , " thank you , Charisma . I think maybe today I am . " <p> " There are two basic kinds of birds in the jungle , " Renato had said on our last day in Imuya , " the ones who eat fruit and the ones who eat bugs . " <p> " You make it sound so simple , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both my hands so I 'd listen . " The ones who eat fruit have more time to sing . " <p> On the 747 from Quito to Miami , I 'd been amazed by the graceful curve of the South American continent , by the way the biggest waves shimmered before they crashed on the impossibly long virgin shore . In the beginning , Renato had said , all of the world was America . <p> I stayed awake until the sky started to lighten . Even in Point Barrow the sun would be rising soon . I fell into sleep and dreamed about taking my life back to the river . For the rest of the morning , the howler monkeys cried in my dreams . <p>
