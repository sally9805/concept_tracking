At the time , there was no way of knowing the significance of the final leg of the torch run at the opening ceremony for the Atlanta Olympics . It was simply nice that the leg began with Atlanta native and former Olympic boxer Evander Holyfield running in the tunnel beneath the stadium , with his own smile as a beacon , and ended with the lighting of the torch by Muhammad Ali . <P> There was also no way of knowing what would transpire on Nov. 9 in Las Vegas . Holyfield , 34 , and thought to be on the ropes of his career , vanquished W.B.A . champion Mike Tyson to become the only heavyweight besides Ali to win a title three separate times . By beating the supposedly invincible Tyson with an 11th-round TKO , Holyfield dealt a resounding blow to Don King 's gangstas of boxing , not to mention the bookmakers who were happy to take sucker bets on the 7-1 underdog . " I got caught in something strange , " said Tyson . <P> Or something wonderful , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice the sweet science , Holyfield had won only two of his past four fights , and the Nevada State Athletic Commission was so worried about a heart irregularity that it would not sanction the fight unless he received clearance from the Mayo Clinic . " Nobody thought I could win , " Holyfield said last Friday during a swing through New York City . " Their judgments were not based on our talents , though , but on our images . It was the monster with hate in his heart versus a man who was always talking about God . But the Bible tells us to have no fear , and I did n't . Besides , I 've known Mike since I was 17 . He 's not so bad . " <P> In retrospect , there are a number of reasons why Holyfield was able to humble the bully . He has the ability to take a punch , and as a longtime student of Tyson , he knew he could push him around and tire him out . Holyfield trained much harder than Tyson did . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figurative corner was his new wife , Dr. Janice Itson , an internist from Chicago whom he met several years ago at a revival meeting . Midway between the Olympics and the fight , Holyfield asked her to marry him  --  and to help take care of his finances as well as his six children by four different women . Not only did she restore order to his Atlanta household , but she also gave her husband a new sense of well-being . " I never could 've beaten Tyson without Janice , " he says . <P> Holyfield will never achieve the popularity of Ali or Tyson or even George Foreman , in part because goodness does n't sell as well as brashness or menace or comedy . But there should be a place in the heavyweight pantheon for a champion who travels without an entourage , for a man who truly cares about others . Asked if he would like to train boxers , Holyfield recalled a painful experience he had while coaching the Holyfield Team , a group of amateur boxers . " I was working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the opponent was in tears . Turns out he was crushed because I was his hero , and now his hero was in the opposite corner . I decided I could n't hurt another person that way . "
