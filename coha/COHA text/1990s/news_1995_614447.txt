<p> Like thousands of other Atlanta residents , Georgia Tech freshman Randy Rhoads came to this Panhandle resort for a weekend of sun , sand and fun . <p> He had grown up swimming in the rough waters off Nags Head , N.C. , on family vacations , but on May 19 he drowned in a powerful rip current in the Gulf of Mexico . <p> Rhoads is one of 15 victims claimed by the Gulf here in the past 18 months , a grim tally that has sent a shock wave through national lifesaving circles . <p> The city has taken steps to improve beach safety , but officials from a national lifeguard association say Panama City Beach should do more to protect swimmers . Among their concerns : <p> &gt; There are only four public lifeguards , all stationed at the city 's single public beach . Most of the 11 miles of beach within the city limits is privately owned . <p> &gt; Lifeguards are not required to be trained in making surf rescues , even though most victims drown in rough seas . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private beaches is left to property owners , who are not required to hire lifeguards . Signs are required to warn of unguarded beaches . <p> &gt; Most of the 100 private lifeguards work for companies whose main purpose is to make money renting beach gear to tourists . At least one guard is required to do nothing but watch the surf , but other , unauthorized workers apparently have worked as lifeguards . <p> &gt; Last year Daniel Jenkins , one such worker , drowned trying to make a rescue . Witnesses said he was walking the beach with a lifesaving buoy and whistle . He had no lifeguard training . <p> &gt; Many visitors are from rural areas with little access to swimming pools or lessons and are unfamiliar with ocean currents . Some ignore posted warnings . <p> Citywide lifeguards too costly ? <p> " Their system is a blueprint for how not to provide public safety , " said Chris Brewster , a California lifeguard and chairman of the certification committee of the U.S. Lifesaving Association , a nonprofit group . " It 's a wholly inadequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 , California 's publicly guarded beaches affiliated with his group had 142 million visitors and five drownings , while Panama City Beach had 2.5 million visitors and five drownings . In 1994 , the city had 3 million visitors and 10 drownings . <p> In Daytona Beach and Volusia County , there were 8 million visitors in 1994 an d two drownings . Volusia has 250 public lifeguards on 43 miles of beaches . <p> But Panama City Beach has n't always led the list : From 1990 to 1992 , it had only three drownings . In 1989 , however , there were 11 . The numbers seem to be higher in years with frequent stormy weather and rough surf . <p> City officials are familiar with Brewster 's criticisms : He came to town in January - at his group 's expense - to discuss the issues . So far , they 've been unwilling to adopt his chief suggestion of hiring more public lifeguards . <p> " There has been talk of citywide lifeguards , but it 's fairly expensive , " said City Manager Richard Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year would cost about $ 1.8 million . Our general fund budget is $ 4.8 million a year . " <p> Jackson said there are also questions about whether the city should provide lifeguards on private property . A recent court decision ruled that the city has no duty to do so unless it declares the beach a designated public swimming area . Some Florida cities do provide guards on beaches fronting private property . <p> Arrest for failure to leave surf <p> Panama City Beach has taken several steps to improve beach safety , Jackson said , including tightening its regulation of private lifeguards . Officials are upgrading a system of colored flags that warn visitors of dangerous conditions and are working with the Red Cross to start a surf rescue training course for lifeguards . They hope to increase public awareness with brochures and advertisements . <p> City leaders also recently gave police the authority to arrest people who refuse to leave the surf during dangerous conditions . There have been cases of drunken swimmers returning to the water repeatedly after warnings . <p> As for criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to further its own being , " Jackson said . <p> Brewster , who is chief of lifeguards for the city of San Diego , is stunned by the situation in Panama City Beach . <p> After his meeting in January , he held a press conference citing the city 's " callous disregard for the persons using its beaches - happy to take their money but unwilling to provide them with reasonable levels of safety . " <p> The city responded with a letter warning him against making defamatory statements . <p> Panama City Beach 's lifeguard system is not unique . While most communities on Florida 's Atlantic coast - including Daytona Beach , Fort Lauderdale and Miami - hire and train their own lifeguards , several Panhandle communities , including Destin and Okaloosa County , leave lifeguarding to private property owners . <p> Those owners hire guards from companies that also rent beach gear . The companies often pay tens of thousands of dollars to hotels and condominiums for the right to be on the beach . <p> Safety vs. profit <p> Said James Struzinski of Sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my lifeguards in the surf , but I know with the competition so intense , some companies might be tempted to choose a person who is a better salesman than lifeguard . " <p> Okaloosa County has had three drownings in the past 30 months . The county attracts smaller , and generally older , crowds than Panama City Beach . <p> Another issue is training . Panama City Beach requires that lifeguards be trained by the YMCA or Red Cross , both known for outstanding pool-based water safety programs . Neither offers surf rescue courses . <p> Brewster says such training is essential , and most coastal cities with lifeguard services have developed their own programs . <p> " It takes very special skills and a particularly strong swimmer to lifeguard in the surf , " he said . " You must break through the waves to get to the victim , then get him in through breaking surf . " <p> Panama City Beach officials are working with the Red Cross to start such a program and may soon require it of lifeguards . <p> Did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training is needed . The Tech students arrived on Friday , May 19 , and headed straight to the beach . It was about 5:15 p.m. - shortly after a nearby lifeguard had closed his stand . <p> " We saw the red flag meaning dangerous currents , but we did n't know what it meant , " said Marc McGrath , one of Rhoads ' fraternity brothers . " We thought it was a flag the condo flew , not a warning . " <p> McGrath said a lifeguard later told him that a sign explaining the flag system had been taken down for the night . <p> Rhoads , 18 , a high school athlete and strong swimmer , ventured into the choppy surf with several friends . He had not been drinking , they said . They swam to an offshore sandbar and were pulled out to sea by a strong rip current . <p> " They tried to swim back to the sandbar , " McGrath said . " All of them made it but Randy . They kept looking for him but could n't find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is struggling to cope with the death of a son who made straight A 's , was a National Merit Scholarship finalist and had just begun fulfilling his lifelong dream of going to Georgia Tech to become a civil engineer . <p> " It 's an incomprehensible loss , " said his father , R. Douglas Rhoads , a retired FBI agent who is now a captain with the Albemarle County police . " I 'm at a loss to say what I hope would come out of his death . If you had a street corner with 15 deaths , you 'd have the public screaming that something be done . It 's apparent that what 's in place there is n't working . " <p> Brewster agrees . <p> " If I 'm from Georgia going down to the beach for the weekend with my kids , I would n't want to bring one of them home dead , " he said . " While public education and warning flags are valuable , I 've never seen a flag rescue a drowning person . " Most of Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panama City Beach has only four public lifeguards , leaving most of its beaches to private businesses , which are not required to hire guards .
