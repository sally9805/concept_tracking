Will Smith has covered all grounds in the entertainment industry-and with great success !

He 's gone from a Grammy Award-winning rapper to one of the hottest actors in Hollywood // Will Smith has seamlessly moved from being a successful rapper to star of NBC 's hit " Fresh Prince of Bel-Air " to quickly becoming a No. 1 big screen , box-office draw with his performance in the mega hit film Independence Day . Smith , now 28 , first made headlines almost a decade ago when he was part of the hit-making rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince . Eleven years ago , Smith and friend Jeff Townes formed the rap duo D. J. Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince . As The Fresh Prince , Smith dropped witty , good-humored rhymes , while Townes , known as D. J. Jazzy Jeff , deejayed . The two recorded six albums and garnered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trouble , Rock the House , Nightmare on My Street , I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson , and Boom ! Shake the Room . They carved their mark in the music industry when , in 1988 , they became the first rap duo or group to win a Grammy Award . The duo won for the song , Parents Just Do n't Understand . And , in 1991 , they won a second Grammy Award in the same category for the tune Summertime . Then Smith was bitten by the acting bug . He joined the cast of the sitcom " Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , " where , for six years , he humored audiences with his unique brand of humor on the NBC show . The fun-loving comedian disarmed both Black and White audiences with that special gift of humor . He always managed to come across to audiences as nice and genuine . His rap partner , Jazzy Jeff , also was a regular on the sitcom . Photograph Smith was Marine fighter pilot Steven Hiller in the 1996 box office hit Independence Day .

Photograph At the age of 17 , Smith found great success as a rapper , the Fresh Prince , He , along with rap partner Jeff Townes , known as Jazzy Jeff , became the rap duo D.J . Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince . In 1988 , they became the first rap group to receive a Grammy Award . Photograph Eight years ago Smith made his television debut on the popular TV comedy " The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , which also starred Janet Hubert-Whitten and James Avery . Later , Hubert-Whitten was replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid .

Later , Hubert-Whitten was replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid . // Smith said his father was the person who gave him the advice that has made his move from rap to television and movies easier . " What my father always made very clear to me is just do one thing well , just make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you do one thing well , everything else will come from that . I started off rapping , and I did it as a hobby . And that 's when you really get good at something . When you enjoy what you do , you 're gon na get good at it . And I just really concentrated on it , and I focused on it and the television show came from that and I worked really hard . " And now , he has conquered the big screen , winning over a whole new set of fans . But his move to the big screen was very methodical . While still doing " Fresh Prince , " Smith performed in the 1992 movie Where the Day Takes You and Made In America in 1993 . But it was his stunning performance the same year in the movie Six Degrees of Separation which won him rave reviews . The versatile actor portrayed Paul Poitier , a gay con artist masquerading as legendary actor Sidney Poitier 's son . He also teamed with fellow comic Martin Lawrence to play Det @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law enforcement official in Bad Boys . That movie turned out to be a major hit for the two . Then , last summer , came the biggest hit of recent years . Independence Day pulled in a record $306. 1 million in 1996 , and it was the No. 1 box office grosser of the year . When asked why they chose to cast Smith as one of the three male leads ( Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman are the others ) , producers said they wanted a Black actor and one with the kind of universal appeal that Smith had demonstrated . As Steven Hiller , a Marine fighter pilot undertaking the dangerous mission of going into an alien spacecraft to prevent it from destroying planet Earth , Smith showed his comic and dramatic side . Besides good reviews , Smith garnered another , quite unexpected benefit from that movie . He 's become a sex symbol for many female fans . And , for him , that 's been a double-edged sword . For example , he recently told Movieline : " I was in Manhattan making Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and started mouthing over and over , Oh my God . Oh , my God , ' then crashed into another car . Now , she gets out of her car , but she does n't say , Oh , I crashed into the back of a car ! ' She runs over to me and asks for my autograph . That 's when I thought : This is real different . Then , I was at the Virgin Megastore in Manhattan and this girl came up to me , pulled her shirt up and asked me to sign her breasts with a Sharpie . I mean , she 's standing there in the middle of the store with her breasts hanging out , and I 'm like , Listen , those are really nice breasts , but this is really an inappropriate time and place . ' In another store , this toothless 80-yearold lady came up to me , grabbed my face and tried to kiss me right on the lips . I said , Now , ma'am , if I walked up to you , grabbed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cops would give me a Rodney King and take me right to jail . ' And she was like , Oh , stop being mean . Just give me a kiss . ' I mean , geriatric tongue kisses are pretty much out , in my book . " Photograph 4 Smith won critical acclaim as the gay con artist Paul Poitier in the 1993 film Six Degrees of Separation , which also starred Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing . Photograph In 1995 , Smith starred opposite comedian-actor Martin Lawrence in the smash action flick Bad Boys . // Smith also pointed out that another downside of the phenome nal success of Independence Day has been that some buffed guys see him and immediately want to see how good a fighter he is . All the years he was just the Fresh Prince , he said , " I was nonthreatening . So nobody wanted to fight me , but then I buffed up for Independence Day , came on a little cocky , and suddenly people want to knock me down . " One of the roles he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychopathic killer in Just Cause . Blair Underwood got the nod for that movie which also featured Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw . But now , Smith has moved to the top of the list when scripts are sent out . And not just to Black actors . He recently wrapped up his science-fiction , action comedy , Men in Black , where he will star opposite Tommy Lee Jones . He was n't too keen on doing back-to-back movies featuring aliens . But legendary Hollywood producer Steven Spielberg convinced him that the film would be very different from Independence Day . Benny Medina , one of the producers of " Fresh Prince , " was quoted in the Chicago Tribune as saying that he envisioned Smith being a big movie success even before a single episode of the hit sitcom was shot . " Movies were something he said he wanted to do the first time we talked to him , " he said . " Within the next couple of days , he had to do an audition , and he picked up this lousy script and read life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network brass and everyone . Afterward , I realized I had just sat through one of those moments that people always talk about having . Once he was in front of the camera , he still had the ability to completely capture your attention and really hold it .

" That 's why TV actors pop on film screens , especially TV comics . Tom Hanks , Jim Carrey , Robin Williams . What happens is , from doing TV comedy , you work so hard to maximize every single individual second , then when you get to do a movie , you have all the time you need . What ? You mean I can try 15 or 20 different options ? ' You got ta love that ! The energy seems to come through from that training . " And for Smith , the training is paying off handsomely . He is getting swamped with scripts now . And , of course , the expectations have increased as well . Some movie industry observers are waiting to see if Smith 's next big release , Men in Black , will bring in as much money as Independence Day . He knows the long-standing axiom in Hollywood is " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very unaffected . He 's already seen the highs and lows of success . He was rich by 18 and nearly bankrupt by 19 . Smith , a divorced , single father of a 4-yearold son who bears his same name , has been dating actress Jada Pinkett , a woman he affectionately calls " Miss Jada , " for the last couple of years . So , Smith figures he 's ready for whatever his current fling with success will bring . <p>
