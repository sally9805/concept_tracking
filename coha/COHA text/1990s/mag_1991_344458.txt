The name Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has about it the deep sonority of history . Unfortunately , it is history  --  or virtually so . Last week members of the Soviet parliament batted around suggested titles for the disintegrating union . Among the candidate monikers are the Union of Sovereign Soviet States ( a Gorbachev favorite ) , the Euroasian Economic Community and the Commonwealth of Sovereign States of Europe and Asia . One cynic even suggested the Club of Crippled Nations . <P> The problem with the Soviet Union is that each of its many incompatible parts may be slighted by a name that failed to take specific national identities into account . The solution reached by Pakistan ( an initial from each of its eight component regions ) would be ideal  --  except for the fact that there are 12 republics to deal with . The acronyms are hardly euphonious or politic . Turgutmakbak , for example , simply turns the new confederation into gobbledygook . Using syllables from some of the republics would be just as untenable . For example , the Belokazakirghuzbek Russukra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states of Tadzhikistan , Turkmenistan , Moldavia , Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan . And what would the country 's inhabitants be called ? Bruskis ? <P> The demise of the initials U.S.S.R. will mean that one classic Beatles tune will become archaic . But initials are tricky things . The Soviets ( or ex- Soviets , as the case may be ) should be careful not to name their country the Basically United Sovereign Territories .
