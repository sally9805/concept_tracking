I went to professor Pine for help twice in my life , once as a child and once as an adult . The first time , I was eleven and had fallen into an inexplicable depression . This happened in the spring of 1967 , seemingly overnight , and for no reason . Any happiness in me just flew away , like birds up and out of a tree . <p> Until then I had been a normal , healthy child . My parents had never damaged me in any way . They had given me a dusty , simple childhood on the flatlands of Saskatchewan . I had two best friends  --  large , unselfish girls who were already gearing up for adolescence , sometimes laughing until they collapsed . I had a dog named Chest , who late at night brought me half-alive things in his teeth  --  bats with human faces , fluttering birds , speckled , choking mice . <p> My parents could n't help noticing my sadness . They looked at me as if they were afraid of me . Sometimes at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt compelled to reassure them . But when I tried to say that I was all right , my voice would crack and I would feel my face distorting , caving in . I would close my eyes then , and cry . <p> One night my parents came into my bedroom and sat down on my bed . " Honey , " my father said , " your mother and I have been thinking about you a lot lately . We were thinking that maybe you would consider talking to somebody  --  you know , a therapist  --  about what is the matter . " My father was an earnest , cheerful man , a geologist with a brush cut and a big heart . I could n't imagine that a therapist would solve my problems , but my father looked hopeful , his large hand tracing a ruffle around my bedspread . <p> Three days later we were standing outside an office on the fourth floor of the Humanities Building . My appointment was not with a true therapist but rather with a professor of child psychology at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a voice called from behind the door in a bit of a singsong , " Come in you , come in you . " Of course he was expecting us , but this still seemed odd , as if he knew us very well or as if my father and I were both little children  --  or elves . The man sitting behind the desk when we entered was wearing a denim shirt , his blond hair slicked back like a rodent 's . He looked surprised  --  a look that turned out to be permanent . He did n't stand up , just waved at us . From a cage in the corner three birds squawked . My father approached the desk and stuck out his hand . " Peter Bergen , " my father said . <p> " Professor Roland Boland Pine , " the man said , and then looked at me . " Hello , girlie . " <p> Despite this , my father left me alone with him . Perhaps he just thought , as I did , that Professor Pine talked like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond as if to other children . I sat in a black leather chair . The professor and I just stared at each other for a while . I did n't know what to say , and he was n't speaking either . It was easy to stare at him . As if I were staring at an animal , I felt no embarrassment . <p> " Well , " he said at last , " your name is Margit ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " How are you today , Margit ? " <p> " I 'm okay . " <p> " Do you feel okay ? " <p> " Yes . I feel okay . " <p> " Do you go to school , Margit ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Do you like your teacher ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " Do you hate him ? " <p> " It 's a her . " <p> " Do you hate her ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Why are you here , Margit ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything at home okay ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Do you love your father ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Do you love your mother ? " A long tic broke on his face , from the outer corner of his left eye all the way down to his neck . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Is she a lumpy mother ? <p> " Pardon me ? " <p> " Pardon me , Margit . I meant does your mother love you ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Does she love your father " <p> I paused . " Yes . " <p> " And does he love her ? " <p> " I guess so . " <p> " Margit , what is the matter ? " <p> " Nothing . I just do n't see why we 're talking about my parents so much . " <p> " Why do n't they love each other ? " <p> " They do  --  I said they do . " <p> " Why ca n't you talk about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " <p> " You can tell me the truth . Do they hurt each other ? Lots of girls ' parents hurt each other . " <p> " No , they do n't . " <p> " Is one of them having an affair , maybe ? " <p> I did n't say anything . " Maybe ? " he repeated . <p> " Maybe , " I said . <p> " Which one , Margit ? Which one of the baby faces ? " <p> I stared at him . Another tic passed over his face . " Pardon me , Margit . I meant which one of your parents is having the affair ? " <p> " My dad . But I do n't think he 's actually having it . I just heard him tell my mom a few months ago that he was considering it . " <p> " And do you think he is ? " <p> " I do n't know . A few weeks ago I picked up the phone and a woman was talking to my dad . She told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that would make a difference . " <p> " How difficult for you . How sad for the girlie-whirl . " Another tic , like a fault line shifting . " Margit , may I tell you something from my own childhood ? " <p> This worried me , but I said yes . <p> " When I was young , I loved my mother . She was a real lumper . Then one day , kerpow , she was dead . " He held his forefinger to his head as if it were the barrel of a gun and stared at me for a few seconds without speaking . " It was n't actually her , you see , but a woman of about her age who happened to be walking toward me on the sidewalk . A man came running and shot her . I was so devastated that I fell right on top of her . I did n't care if he shot me , too . I was only ten at the time , and my mother 's death could have scarred me for life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got from that moment to this one  --  how I got from there to here , to sitting behind this desk now , talking to you ? " <p> I shook my head . " How ? " <p> " I rose above the situation . Literally I did . I felt my mind lift slightly out of my body , and I stared down at myself leaning over the bleeding woman . I said to myself , very calmly , there is little Roland from New Orleans , the little erky-terk , realizing that someday his mother will die . " <p> He was looking at me so intently , and his birds were flapping in their cage with such fervor , that I felt I had to say something . " Wow , " I said . <p> " I suggest you try it , Margit . For every situation there is a proper distance . Growing up is just a matter of gaining perspective . Sometimes you just need to jump up for a moment , a foot above the earth . And sometimes you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin slats , footholds , from here to the sun , Margit , for the baby faces to step on . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " Slatland , flatland , mapland . " <p> " Pardon me ? " <p> " Pardon me , Margit . I know so many languages that sometimes I say words out of place . " <p> At the end of the session I asked him when I should return . He told me that another visit would n't be necessary , that usually his therapy worked the first time . <p> I did n't in fact understand what he had said to me , but his theory seemed to help anyway , as if it were a medication that worked whether you understood it or not . That very evening I was having dinner with my parents . It started as the usual dinner  --  me staring at my plate , my parents staring at me as if I were about to break in two . But about halfway through the meal I started feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift slightly out of myself . I looked down at our tiny family . I saw my father from above , the deep map of his face . I understood in an instant that of course he was having an affair , and that he was torn between my mother and this other , distant woman . I saw my beautiful mother from above , and I could see how she must hate this other woman , yet sympathize as well , because this other woman was very ill . I understood how complicated it was to be an adult , and how haunting , and how lovely . I longed to be back in my body then , to be breathing and eating , straining toward maturity . And when I returned , one split second later , I hugged my parents , one after the other , with a spontaneity that a depressed person could never muster . <p> In the twenty years that passed between my first visit to Professor Pine and my second , from 1967 to 1987 , I remained in the same city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then from the University of Saskatchewan , with a degree in biology . As an adult , I worked as a soil consultant , traveling around the province to small satellite towns in a flatbed truck that I could sleep in , if necessary , on warm nights . <p> Bouts of the depression did return , but they never overwhelmed me . Perhaps my life was not the most rigorous testing ground for Professor Pine 's technique , because my life was relatively free of tragedy . Most of my depression erupted out of nowhere . I 'd be in the fields in the midst of a bright day , and a dreariness would mysteriously descend . I 'd sink into it for a few minutes , but the lift would always come . I would take a step up , or two or three , and recognize how good life in fact was . From above , my job appeared to me excellent and strange . There I was , under a blazing sun , kneeling in a yellow expanse , weighing samples of earth . And later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt for traces of nitrogen and phosphorus , the gleam of potash . <p> One night , in the middle of the year 1985 , I made the mistake of describing this technique to my fiance , Rezvan Balescu , the Romanian liar . We had known each other for only two months at this point , but we were already engaged . We were standing on a small balcony outside our apartment . He was smoking , wearing pajamas under a down-filled jacket , and he was in the midst of one of his tirades on North America , which he loved and hated . " This place is so strange to me , so childish . You have so many problems that are not real , and you are so careful and serious about them . People discuss their feelings as if they were great works of art or literature that need to be analyzed and examined and passed on and on . In my country people love or they hate . They know that a human being is mysterious , and they live with that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eat , that 's a problem . If you have no leg , that 's a problem . If you are unhappy , that is not a problem to talk about . " <p> " I think it is , " I said . <p> " Exactly . That is because you are an American . For you , big things are small , and small things are big . " Rezvan was always making these large declarations on America in a loud voice from our balcony . <p> " I bet you one million in money , " Rezvan said as he blew out smoke , " that the number of hours Americans spend per week in these  --  what do you call them ?  --  therapy offices is exactly the same number of hours Romanians spend in line for bread . And for what ? Nothing . To make their problems bigger . They talk about them all day so at night they are even bigger . " <p> " I do n't agree . The reason why people talk about their problems is to get over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapist once and he was very helpful . " <p> " You ? " He lifted an eyebrow , took a drag . <p> " Yes , when I was eleven . " <p> " Eleven ? What could be the problem at eleven ? " <p> " I was just sad . My parents were getting divorced , and I guess I could tell that my dad was about to leave . " <p> " But is n't that the correct emotion-sadness when a father leaves ? Can a therapist do anything to bring your father home ? " <p> " No , but he gave me a way to deal with it . " <p> " And what is that way ? I would like to know . " <p> " Well , just a way to separate from the situation . " <p> " How do you separate from your own life ? " <p> " Well , you rise above it . You gain some objectivity and perspective . " <p> " But is this proper If you have a real problem , should you rise above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child feels sad . This seems right to me . This rising above , that is the problem . In fact , that is the problem of America . I can not tell my family back home that if they are hungry or cold , they should just rise above it . I can not say , ' Do n't worry , go to the movies , go shop , here is ten dollars in money , go buy some candy . Rise above your situation . " <p> " That 's not what I mean . I mean you literally rise above it . Your mind hovers over your body , and you understand the situation from a higher perspective . " I knew that if he pushed me far enough , this would end up sounding insane . <p> " So this is what your man , your eleven-year-old therapist , teaches you : to separate your mind from your body , to become unhinged . This does not teach you to solve the problem ; this teaches you to be a crazy person . " <p> But already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of the roof . There she is , I thought , Margit Bergen , twenty-nine years old , in love with Rezvan of Romania , a defector who escaped political hardship to arrive first in a refugee camp in Austria and a year later in Regina , Saskatchewan , where he now stands on a balcony in the moonlight , hassling her about America , as if she contained all of it inside her . <p> I had met Rezvan in my father 's lab at the university . Rezvan was a geologist , like my father . Technically , for grant reasons , he was a graduate student , but my father considered him a peer , because Rezvan had already worked for years as a geologist for the Romanian government . <p> Originally he had been a supporter of Ceausescu . In fact , his father , Andrei , had been a friend of Ceausescu 's right up until the time Andrei died , in 1985 . Rezvan , by his own account , stood by his father 's deathbed as he died and held his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , because Rezvan had by then ceased to be loyal to Ceausescu . <p> In the two years that Rezvan and I lived together , I would often rise from sleep to find him hunched over his desk , the arm of his lamp reaching over him . He wrote long letters into the night , some in English and some in Romanian . The English ones , he said , were to various government officials , asking for help in getting his family over to Canada . The ones in Romanian were to his family , an assortment of aunts and uncles and cousins . He wrote quickly , as in a fever , and if I crept up on him and touched his back , he would jump and turn over his letters immediately before looking up at me in astonishment . At the time , I thought this was simply an old habit of fear , left over from living for so long in a police state . <p> Sometimes he said he could not forgive his country for keeping his family captive . He told what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended with some cartoonish , undignified death for Ceausescu : his head in a toilet , his body flattened by a steamroller . Other times he spoke about his country with such longing  --  the wet mist of Transylvania , the dark tunnels beneath the streets of his town , the bookstores lined with propaganda that opened into small , dusty rooms in back filled with real books . <p> In this same way Rezvan loved and hated America . He would rant about it from the balcony , but then we would return to our bed and sit side by side , our backs to the wall , and watch the local and then the national news , where almost every night somebody would criticize the Prime Minister , Brian Mulroney . Rezvan could never get over this : men appearing on television to insult their leader night after night , and never getting pulled off the air . Sometimes we would turn to the news from the United States , which we received through a cable channel from Detroit . This was a real treat for Rezvan during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to me one night . <p> " Reagan ? You do n't like Reagan . " <p> " I know , but look at him now . " They were showing a clip of Reagan waving . His face did look kind . His eyes were veering off , looking skyward . He looked like somebody 's benevolent , faintly crazy grandfather . <p> " All day long people insult him and he does n't kill any of them . " <p> Rezvan sometimes skipped work and came with me to the fields . He 'd ride in the back of the truck , standing up , so that his head was above the cab , the wind pouring over him . He wanted to know all the details of my job . He became better than I was at some things . He could spot poor field drainage from far away . He loved to point out the signs of it  --  the mint , the rushes , the wire grass , the willows . <p> For lunch we stopped in the towns along the way at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were run by Ukrainian women . Each one adored Rezvan . He would kiss their hands and speak in his strange accent  --  part British , part Romanian  --  and they would serve him free platefuls of food , one after another , hovering over him as if he were a long-lost son from the old country . <p> One afternoon , while we were driving back to the city from a little town called Yellow Grass , I fell asleep at the wheel . I woke up after the crash to see Rezvan crumpled against the passenger door . I felt myself rising then , far above the car , far above even the treeline . From there I watched myself crawl out of the wreck and drag Rezvan out onto the grassy shoulder . And then , instead of watching my own body run down the long charcoal highway , I stayed above Rezvan . I watched the trees bow in the wind toward his body , listening for his heartbeat . <p> Later that night , when I entered his hospital room for the first time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , though . " In my country , " he said , " you could work for Ceausescu . He has been trying to do this to me for years . " I started apologizing then , over and over . Rezvan just motioned me toward the bed , and then put his arms around me . " It 's okay , it 's okay , " he said . " Do n't cry . This is America . This is what is supposed to happen . I will sue you , and your insurance will give us money , and we will go on a trip . To California , a vacation . I am so happy . " <p> I wiped my eyes and looked at him . His head was cocked to the side . A thin white bandage was wrapped around his forehead , and blood was still matted in the black curls of his hair . One side of his face was torn apart . His leg was suspended in a sling . Still , he looked at me incredulously , wondering how I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the next few months he had a cane , which he loved . He liked to point at things with it . The scars settled into faint but permanent tracks down the left side of his face . He liked that , too . We saw the movie Scarface over and over again . When he discarded the cane , he still walked with a slight limp , which gave his gait an easy rocking motion that seemed strangely to suit him . He never once blamed me ; I do n't think it ever crossed his mind . <p> Rezvan and I stayed engaged for two years . He seemed to think of engagement as an alternative to marriage rather than as a lead-up to it . I did n't mind , actually . I just wanted to be with him . Life with Rezvan had a sort of gloss to it always . He passed quickly from emotion to emotion , from sadness to gratitude to arrogance , but he never fell into depression , ever . <p> Perhaps because I was so happy with Rezvan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs . But , oddly enough , the signs indicating that a man is in love with another woman are often similar to the signs of an immigrant in a new country , his heart torn in two . He wrote long letters home ; he hesitated to talk about the future ; during lonely nights he seemed to be murmuring as he fell asleep , but not to me . <p> Nearly a year passed before I even noticed anything , or admitted to myself that I noticed anything . Then one day Rezvan received a phone call at four in the morning . I did n't understand a word of it , since it was in Romanian , but in my half sleep I could hear him mutter the word rila again and again , sometimes insistently . And when he hung up , after about an hour and a half , he just sat there in the living room like a paralyzed man , the light slowly rising across his body . I asked him , " Rezvan , what does rila mean ? " He told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . <p> Two days later , as I walked up our driveway in my housecoat , the mail in my hand , I glanced through the letters and noticed a thick letter from Rilia Balescu . Rila was Rilia , a person , a relative . When I walked in the door , Rezvan was standing in his striped pajamas drinking coffee , smoking , scratching his head . As I handed him the letter , I tried to read his face , but saw nothing . So I said , " Who is Rilia ? " <p> " She is my sister , my baby sister . Gavrilia . " <p> Does an extra beat pass before one tells a lie ? This is what I had always believed , but Rezvan answered immediately . Perhaps he had been waiting for the question . <p> " I did n't know you had a sister . " <p> " I do n't like to talk about her . We disowned each other long ago . She follows Ceausescu still ; she has pictures of him and his son on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to bring her over , but she is stubborn . She would rather go to the Black Sea and vacation with her boys than come here and live with me . " <p> " So why have you never told me about her ? " <p> " Because it is not wise to speak aloud the one thing you want more than anything . You know that . " <p> " No , I do n't know that . " <p> " It 's true . Romanians have a word for it : ghinion . It means do n't speak aloud what you want most . Otherwise it will not happen . You must have a word for this in English ? " <p> " Jinx . " <p> " Okay . I did not tell you about my sister because of jinx . " <p> " Why did you tell me her name meant ' well-lit ' ? <p> " Pardon ? " <p> " The other day I asked you , and you said that ' Rilia ' was the word for ' well-lit . ' " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' well-lit . ' Rilia is my sister . " He smiled and kissed my face . " We will have to work on your accent . " <p> Over the next month we settled into a routine . When Rezvan finished writing his letters in the night , he padded down the driveway , set the letters in the mailbox , and lifted the tiny , stiff red flag so that our mailman would stop in the morning . And then , after Rezvan was asleep , I would rise out of bed and go to the mailbox myself , pick out the ones to Rilia , and slip them into the pocket of my housecoat . I did the same thing with the letters she sent him . I collected those in the morning . <p> At first it did n't feel like a strategy . But I was desperate to know if Rilia really was his sister or his wife  --  as if her handwriting would tell me . Rezvan left for work an hour before I did , and I opened the letter then . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , cross-referencing . Some of her passages were blacked out by censors . I found many names , but mostly two , Gheorghe and Florian , again and again . Gheorghe and Florian , Gheorghe and Florian , Gheorghe and Florian . I began to realize , very slowly , that these were probably their children . <p> On one of these mornings my mother showed up at my door to drop off a skirt she had sewed for me . " Good , " she said , bustling in , " you 're home . I wanted to drop this off . " Already , as she said this , she was rapidly moving through the rooms of our apartment . My mother liked to do this , to catch me off guard and check all my rooms immediately for anything I might hide if given the time . " What is this ? " she said , reaching the bedroom , where all the pages were strewn across the bed . <p> " Oh , that 's just some stuff I 'm reading for Rezvan . Proofreading . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so now you proofread in Romanian ? " <p> I smiled weakly . She did n't pry , but for once I wished she would . What I wanted to do was tell her that this was my life spread across the bed , thin as paper , written in a language I could not understand , dotted with four names  --  Rezvan , Gavrilia , Gheorghe , Florian  --  but never my own . I wanted to ask her how she felt when my father was having an affair . And I wanted to ask what happened to the other woman . My father never married her , even after he and my mother split . Where had she drifted off to ? Did she ever lose her breasts ? Did she get well again ? Was she happy somewhere now ? <p> I did n't tell my mother anything , but when she left that day , she gestured toward the bedroom . " You know that you can find people at the university who will translate that for you . " <p> I nodded , and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need them translated Maybe you already know what they say ! " She ducked her face under , so that she could look at my face . " It 'll be okay , " she said , " either way . " <p> I stockpiled the letters for two months . I did n't intend to be malicious ; I was just sitting on them until I could figure out what to do . Every night as I drove home from the fields , I thought , I will tell Rezvan tonight ; I will say I know everything and I am leaving . But when dinner came , I could hardly speak . It was as if I were eleven all over again . <p> Even Rezvan was getting depressed . He said that his letters were turning out to be all in vain . Perhaps , he said , he would quit writing them altogether . One night he said , " Nothing gets through those bastards . Perhaps I will never see Rilia again . " Then he limped to the sink , rocking back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me and said , " Why would they want to keep us apart , anyway ? " His head was tilted to the side , and he looked like a child . He stared at me as if he really expected me to answer . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " I do n't know about that scuff . " <p> But of course I did . At the other end , across the ocean , men in uniforms were collecting letters and censoring them , blacking out whatever threatened them , and at this end I in my housecoat was doing the same thing . <p> I tried to rise above the situation , but that strategy did n't work at all . I was increasingly distressed at what I saw . I 'd fly up and look down . There she is , I 'd say , Margit Bergen of Saskatchewan . Who would have thought she 'd grow up so crooked , crouched on her bed , obstructing love , hoarding it , tearing it apart with her own hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of myself as an open-minded person , able to step into another 's shoes . But I could not picture this Rilia . Her face , and the faces of her children , were blank for me . I hoped that this inability , or unwillingness , to imagine another 's face was not hatred , but I was deeply ashamed that it might be . <p> Finally , one windy night in November , as I cut into a roast , I said , " Rezvan , is Rilia your wife " <p> " What do you know of Rilia ? Has she called ? Has she sent a letter ? " <p> " No , not at all . I was just wondering . " <p> " Tell me what you know . " <p> " I do n't know anything . I was just asking . " <p> " Have you spoken to her on he phone ? " <p> " No , I have not . " I enunciated this very clearly . " Is she your wife , Rezvan ? " <p> " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will marry you to prove this .

" <p> The next morning I put the letters in a bag and drove straight to the administrative offices at the university . A woman disappeared and reappeared with a list of professors who could translate Romanian for me . I had my choice of four . I glanced down the list and there , at number three , was Professor Roland Pine . <p> I found him in the same office . He had aged well , his hair now ash instead of blond , a few extra lines across his face . When he stood up to greet me , I saw that I had grown to be about half a foot taller than he was . His tic was still there , flashing across his face every fifteen seconds or so . As I shook his hand , I marveled that it had continued like this since the last time I 'd seen him , keeping time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margit Bergen . I came to you once as a child .

" <p> " Just childhood depression , I guess . My parents were splitting up . <p> He squinted at me , and turned his face slightly to the side . " Oh , yes , " he said . " That 's right . Of course . Little Margit . You were such a girlie-whirl . So sad . What did you become ? " <p> " You mean in my life ? " <p> " In your life . What did you become ' " <p> " A soil consultant .

Just think : little Roland and little Margit , he professor and the soil consultant , back again , sitting in a warm office surrounded by bird-people .

" <p> I did n't say anything . <p> " Are you being a dirty-girlie ? " He smiled  --  and then a tic , as forked as lightning . <p> I sighed and looked over at his birds , who were cawing loudly . One was green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the letters fluttering in Professor Pine 's hand . <p> " Fine , Professor Pine . If you do n't want to read them , I 'll take them to somebody else . " I reached for the letters . <p> He pulled them back , toward his chest . " Okay , okay , girlie , " he said . " You are so stubborn , Margit . " <p> He read softly , in a lilting voice , as if he were reading me a bedtime story . " Rilia says , Remember how tiny Florian was at his birth ? Now he is forty-five kilos , the same as his brother . Rilia says , Remember the Black Sea , it is as blue as the first time we went to it . Rilia says that Rezvan must be lying when he says there is so much food that sometimes he tosses rotten fruit from the window . " <p> I interrupted . " Do you think they are married ? " <p> " Well , they are both Balescus . " <p> " They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leafed through the letters again . " But here she calls him darling . Darling , barling , starling . " <p> He looked up then . " Oh , no , " he said , " do n't cry . Please do n't cry . " He jumped up , came around the side of the desk , and crouched beside my chair . He looked up at me . His face was close , and the next tic was like slow motion . I saw the path that it followed , curving and winding like a river down his face . <p> He sat back on the edge of his desk . " It 's going to be okay , " he said . " We just have to figure out what the girlie wants . If you want Rezvan , the liar face , you can have him . Is that what you want ! " <p> " No , I do n't think so . I mean , I do , but I ca n't . He has kids and everything . " <p> " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Not really , " I said . <p> " Margit , you need some perspective . " <p> " Perspective ? " <p> " You know "  --  he rolled his eyes upward  --  " Slatland . " Slatland  --  I remembered that that was what he 'd called it , the drifting up and looking down . <p> " I 've tried Slatland . It did n't work , " I said . " Slatland always works . Just close your eyes , all right , girlie ? " <p> I started to stand up . " Thanks for your help , Professor Pine . I really have to go now . " But then I felt it , the lift , and my mind started rising , until the caws of Mortalhead and Eagerheart and Quickeye were far below me . I could see the yellow fields surrounding my town , and then even those went out of focus . I hurtled faster and faster until I finally stopped , what seemed like minutes later . <p> So this is Slatland , I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America , large and jagged , flanked by oceans . Its face was beautiful  --  craggy , broken , lined with rivers . I found my part of the continent , a flat gold rectangle in the upper middle . I saw what my daily life looked like from this distance : my truck beetling through the prairies , dust rising off its wheels the way desire must rise , thousands of fragments of stone lifting off the earth . And when the truck stopped and I stepped out into the bright , empty fields , my loneliness looked extreme . I could almost see it , my longing and desire for Rezvan rising out of me the way a tree rises out of its trunk . I perceived , in an instant , exactly what I should do to keep him . I saw how simple it all would be , just to keep collecting the letters every morning , one by one , in order that what was between Rezvan and his wife would die slowly and easily and naturally , and what was between him and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been able to climb down then , to drop out of Slatland at that moment , everything would have remained simple , and probably Rezvan and I would still be together . But Slatland seemed to have a will of its own . It would not let me go until I looked down to my right . If I was willing to see the simplicity , the purity , of my own desire , then I also had to see the entire landscape  --  the way desire rises from every corner and intersects , creates a wilderness over the earth . <p> I stood on Slatland a long time before I looked down to my right . There it was , Eastern Europe , floating above the Mediterranean . I traced with my finger the outline of Romania . I squinted , down through the mist and mountains , down through the thick moss of trees , until I found her . She stood in a long line of people , her forty-five-kilo children hanging on her skirts . She bent to them and broke for them some bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her and watched . Even so , I might still have been able to return to my own life , my own province , unchanged if she had n't turned her face upward right then , as if she had felt some rain , and looked directly at me . <p> This all happened very fast , in a blink of my eyes . When I opened them , Professor Pine was sitting on his desk , watching me . " You 're a real erky-terk , " he said , with a tic so extreme that it looked like it might swallow his face . He walked me to the door and handed me the letters , which later that night I would give to Rezvan . We would be standing on the balcony in the semidarkness of the moon , and I would be surprised at how easily they passed through my hands , as easily as water . <p> The birds shrieked . " Birdmen ! " Professor Pine said . " Sometimes I feel like saluting them , " he said to me . He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he went up on his tiptoes and kissed me good-bye . <p>
