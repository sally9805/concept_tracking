Elusive Galaxy It was with great interest that I read Susan French 's article " Deep-Sky Hunting in Hercules " ( July issue , page 98 ) , in which she mentioned the little-known galaxy IC 4617 midway between M13 and NGC 6207 . I 've been going after this elusive object since I first learned of it from the late Walter Scott Houston ( S &T:; July 1993 , page 110 ) . However , I disagree with French 's suggestion that IC 4617 calls for at least an 18-inch telescope . I 've suspected it in my 12V2-inch Newtonian and can definitely see it with my 16-inch . It lies among a few very faint stars , so you have to look hard . Always make sure the telescope 's optics are cleaned to a pristine state when seeking such difficult objects . A little dirt does n't affect light transmission very much , but it can indeed cut down contrast . I miss the wonderful challenges Houston presented in his Deep-Sky Wonders column , and it 's good to see an author with a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , VA 23464 kent@exis.net Sky Country In 1959 when we moved to Oklahoma , my wife exclaimed , " There 's so much sky ! " It 's a fact I came to appreciate as the years went on , and I began to develop a love affair with that vast expanse of sky . I had been interested in astronomy as a boy , but now it seemed the opportunities for enjoying it were greater . It surprised us that sometimes , especially on crisp fall nights , we could see the northern lights . This was back in a time when rural living meant rural and before everyone had mercury security lamps . We were within city limits , but you would n't know it by today 's urban standards . I soon developed a habit of stepping out on the porch before going to bed . If it was a clear night ( and in that state , when was n't it ? ) I would watch until I saw a meteor , then turn in . This never seemed to take more than a minute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our feeling of closeness to the heavens was amplified by an experience during the mid-1960s . My wife woke me up one night and simply said , " Fred . Come and look at this ! " As it was about four in the morning , I barely managed to open one eye , but I noticed a flickering on the walls of the room . This could only mean a grass fire ! But in that case Judy would have expressed alarm , and what I heard instead was pure wonderment . We went out onto the driveway and were overwhelmed by the celestial display . This was n't a meteor shower - it was a meteor storm . We stood there transfixed by a sight few ever get to witness . Up the street a milkman was making his quiet deliveries . In fact , we were impressed by how quiet everything was . There was no sound from above , just the orderly smashing of seemingly millions of tiny meteoroids against the Earth 's atmospheric shield . The analogy of snowflakes hitting a car 's windshield at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I began to be aware that it was the windshield that was hitting the snowflakes : in other words , it was we who were hurtling through space . However much one encounters the idea in textbooks , this was a rare and perfect opportunity to experience it ! In recent years we have tried to reconstruct the circumstances of this remarkable event . We believe Judy was up comforting our three-year-old daughter who had a bad dream . The timing was remarkable . With the help of a friend , we now believe we saw the Leonid storm of November 1966 , when experts estimated a rate of 150,000 meteors an hour over the western United States . FRED FISHER 1318 Ridgecrest Circle Denton , TX 76205-5424 The Universe 's Ultimate End " The Future of the Universe " ( August issue , page 32 ) was the most memorable examination of that topic since I read Isaac Asimov 's science fiction short story " The Last Question " when I was a boy . I frequently see articles about the history of the universe , but apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big crunch , the universe 's future is rarely discussed . Congratulations on finding a topic so infrequently written about that most of the article feels entirely new . STEVE SCHONBERGER 16651 NE 48th Court Redmond , WA 98052 **30;571;TOOLONG The article by Fred C. Adams and Gregory Laughlin on the future of the universe compelled me to write my first letter to Sky &; Telescope . To be honest , I found the article both fascinating and disturbing . I guess I always felt that the universe would somehow end with a bang - a final blaze of glory . I find it sad to think it might all end in darkness , like a puff of smoke in the wind . RICHARD TYSON 2347 Steward Ave . Westbury , NY 11590 rltys@msn.com Insurance Against Asteroids Charles Rubin is on target when he points out the dangers of overinsuring against impacts from near-Earth objects ( NEOs ) in " The Hazard of Avoiding Hazards " ( August issue , page 10 ) . In considering options for planetary defense , we must balance cost ( including lost-opportunity costs ) against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why the NASA studies of the impact hazard ( the 1992 Spaceguard Report and the 1995 Shoemaker Committee Report ) focused on the most immediate issue : discovering all the larger NEOs ( those with diameters greater than 1 kilometer ) and identifying any that pose a threat of impact . No plan for defense makes sense without this crucial first step . Several studies , including an economic analysis in Fortune magazine , have estimated the level of expenditure that might be reasonable to " insure the Earth " against the most catastrophic impacts . Here is a simplified order-of-magnitude version . We estimate that an impact that could lead to 1 billion human casualties occurs roughly once per million years , which is equivalent to 1,000 deaths per year . Various economic analyses suggest that the value of saving a human life for purposes of hazard mitigation is between $10,000 and $1 million . ( This value can also be estimated as the lost lifetime earnings resulting from an accidental death . ) From these actuarial arguments , the maximum level of insurance is the dollar level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million and $1 billion per year . How does this dollar range compare with what is being spent , or proposed to be spent , for defense against NEOs ? The Spaceguard Report recommended a search program that would cost $10 million per year . The Shoemaker Committee reduced this to $6 million per year , on the assumption of free access to the 1-meter telescopes of the U.S. Air Force GEODSS network . For fiscal year 1999 NASA expects to invest $3 million through its new NEO Program Office , and the Air Force is also devoting some of its resources to NEO searches . For perspective , to achieve the objective of finding all the NEOs larger than 1 km in the next decade , we must increase the productivity of the search system by a factor of 10 over the 1997 discovery rate . I conclude from the above arguments that it would be prudent and appropriate to spend at least $10 million per year on NEO searches , as the first step in planetary defense . Quite probably an expenditure as great as $100 million could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multibillion-dollar program . Gerrit Verschuur ( June issue , page 26 ) justifies greater planetary defense expenditures in part because he believes the hazard itself is 10 times greater than is estimated by most asteroid experts . But expenditures of $10 million to $100 million per year , focusing on asteroid searches and technology development , can be justified with even a conservative model for the impact hazard .

By the nature of what I do for a living I 'm privileged to see green flashes fairly often . I have yet to see them on three consecutive days , but once I did see two on the same day .

On this occasion the sunlight turned very green just as the limb disappeared , but my passengers were otherwise engaged , as she had just accepted his marriage proposal . Nevertheless , after we had climbed a few hundred feet they were able to watch the last bit of Sun set again , producing yet another green flash - their first and my second of the day .

Belmont , MA 02478 Naming an Unnamed Wonder Alan Whitman 's article on dark nebulae ( August issue , page 114 ) caught my attention . In his opening paragraphs Whitman refers to the very large , striking dark nebula that crosses the Milky Way just north of Deneb . He calls this feature the Funnel Cloud . For perhaps 40 years I 've referred to this nebula as the Cygnus Bar , but its recognition and observational history extend back much further . My perusal of the literature suggests that it received the earliest written mention of any dark nebula excluding the Great Rift and the Coalsack in Crux . As far as I have been able to ascertain , the first observer to publish an account of this object was the French astronomer Le Gentil in 1755 . Le Gentil chronicled a number of bright nebulae in his various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to include it as well . His account of its appearance reads as if it were written today : The second nebula is at the tip of the tail of Cygnus ; it appears to be of a different nature from all the nebulae that have been observed up to now and from the Milky Way , across which it lies , making almost a right angle with it . It is a large cloud , broader at one end than the other ; the small end faces the south-east . The cloud is about 6 degrees distant from the tail of Cygnus ; it seems opaque and very dark . As Whitman mentioned , in spite of its long-standing recognition and unlike so many other celestial wonders , this prominent object seems never to have received an enduring popular name . Is any reader aware of a name by which it was known during the l9th century ? JOHN BORTLE 39 Gold Rd . Stormville , NY 12582 <p>
