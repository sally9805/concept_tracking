<p> Believe it or not , the latest high-fashion food is an ancient bean  --  the fava . Whether still raw in a furry pod that looks like a string bean on steroids , or shelled and lightly cooked , or even dried , favas are definitely in . And yes , this is the legume so eerily extolled by the mostly carnivorous Hannibal Lector in the film " Silence of the Lambs . " <p> Well , chefs do say favas go well with roasted meats . And now the silky smoothness of fresh pureed favas and the chewy crunch of the whole bean are cropping up in all the best places : Chic cookbooks , where favas are treated like an essential ingredient , and all the hot urban restaurants . <p> " Suddenly everybody 's talking about fava beans , " says Pierre Mattia , co-owner of Coppi 's Vigorelli in Washington , who remembers munching on the sweet young harbingers of spring when he was growing up in Italy . <p> " Us trendy chefs are always looking for something new and different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer who 's become a fan of fresh favas . " I love the look of them , their buttery taste and texture . " <p> So restaurant-goers around town this spring have seen the likes of : <p> * Whole wheat noodles with baby artichokes , fresh fava beans and pancetta ( at Obelisk , in Dupont Circle ) <p> * A timbale of fresh fava bean puree and brown basmati rice , served with wild mushrooms and fiddlehead ferns ( at Rupperts , in the Pennsylvania Quarter ) <p> * Baked rockfish flavored with citrus and cumin atop sauteed fava beans and fennel with basil ( at the Morrison-Clark Inn , near Logan Circle ) <p> * Pureed fava beans , pecorino cheese , mint and olive oil setting off a skirt steak with cremini mushrooms , garlic and parsley ( at Coppi 's Vigorelli , in Cleveland Park ) <p> * Seared honey-glazed quail with a ragout of fava beans , morels and fresh corn ( at Ridgewells in Bethesda ) <p> Fava devotee Peter Pastan , the owner/chef at Obelisk , started serving them 10 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecorino cheese . His customers were n't ready . " They had that this- **39;1338;TOOLONG look in their eyes when you put the salad down in front of them , " he recalls . <p> B &B; Washington 's Caterer executive Michael Pietras remembers that nobody much liked the fava beans at feasts a Lebanese friend of his staged in the mid- ' 80s . " At the time they were much too different for many Americans , " he says . " But now you ca n't go into a restaurant without fava beans somewhere on the menu . " <p> Well , maybe not everywhere  --  like , for example , the average local supermarket  --  but favas are de rigueur in upscale restaurants that emphasize or borrow from Italian , Middle Eastern or vegetarian cuisines . Especially in spring or early summer . <p> Like asparagus , fava beans mark the beginning of spring , as they always have in the Mediterranean part of the world . In Italy , March 19 , St. Joseph 's Day , is the day to look for them  --  Saint Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasantry from starving . And as Americans find ways to grow European seasonal delicacies on this side of the ocean , fresh favas have become available from May through October . <p> A legume , favas are a distant cousin to the garden green bean . Shelled like limas from a pod , favas must also be separated from a waxy skin surrounding each individual bean  --  unless they are really young , when they can be eaten raw . The older the beans , the thicker and tougher the waxy skin , and the ( slightly ) more bitter the taste . Frozen and canned favas are available all year long but ca n't compete with the fresh bean  --  especially the small , young , sweet , pale green bean of early spring . <p> Favas are a very old food  --  one thought to have been eaten in Biblical times as well as in ancient Egypt and China . Pythagoras knew about them . According to Carol Field 's " Celebrating Italy , " ( William Morrow , 1990 ) , the ancient Greeks used them in funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked them and served them as a sacred dish at funeral banquets . <p> Philadelphia super-chef Susanna Foo grew up with favas as a child in China and Taiwan , where she watched her mother buy them on daily trips to the market . ( There , she recalls , you could buy them already cleaned  --  and her mother did ) . The family cook prepared them quickly in a little chicken broth with a little oil and garlic and Chinese pickled greens . " If you cook them only a couple of minutes , they stay sweet and the color wo n't change , " says Foo . Fried dried favas were also popular as a snack , like peanuts . " We could get them all year round at the candy store , " she recalls . <p> Middle Easterners and Italians have made the bean their own , serving them raw in salads , with rice or pastas , in soups , on their own sauteed with onion , garlic and lemon , in purees . <p> Pointing to the active spice trade between Persia and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author Najmieh Batmanglij claims Persians used favas before Italians . As a child in Tehran , she ate Baqala-Pokhteh ( favas boiled with vinegar and water and then sprinkled with angelica powder ) as a snack after school . Home cooked at her house , favas also were sold by street vendors all over the country . They were also part of everyday cooking , sometimes in soups , sometimes in rice dishes with fresh dill weed , saffron , cumin , cinnamon and cardamom . Indeed , Batmanglij thinks it was the Iranian immigrant community who popularized favas when they came to America after the revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979 . <p> Maybe , but it 's probably the Italian affection for the beans that has spurred the current fava frenzy . To Francesco Ricchi , co-founder of I Ricchi in Washington and now chef at Cesco in Bethesda , favas remind him of his childhood near Florence . Ricchi recalls evening sorties into neighboring farmers ' fields , where he and his friends would furtively pick and eat the beans . " It was a treat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now featuring a fava bean puree with dandelion lettuce on his menu as well as lettuce leaves stuffed with ricotta cheese and vegetables in a fava bean sauce . <p> These days favas have become so entrenched that the recipes do n't even have to be fancy . Pureed favas are virtually standard fare on local caterers ' menus . David Keener , executive chef at Ridgewells , particularly likes the look and taste of pureed favas . " People really go for them  --  with olive oil and basil , or goat cheese and rosemary , or mint and tarragon , " he says . " Or sometimes with peas for a sweet bright green puree with fresh herbs and Boursin . It 's a different twist , not the same old mashed potatoes . " <p> So how did a bean become an overnight sensation ? <p> For one thing they taste good . They 're a beautiful green , too . " They have a really rich flavor , " says the Hawaii- and Portland , Ore. - based Paul Wenner , author of this year 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " And they 're high in fiber , potassium and vitamin C. " <p> For another , fava beans are exot ic . Their yearly reappearance is evocative of ancient times and faraway places . If we 're fava fans , that makes us a little exotic too . <p> It also helps that favas are expensive  --  what stylish food is n't ? Last week , they cost $ 3.49 a pound at Sutton Place Gourmet , $ 2.95 at Dean &; Deluca and $ 1.99 at Fresh Fields . But prices vary according to availability . This week , for example , Sutton Place , which had been purchasing favas from California , dropped its prices to $ 1.19 per pound after a crop came in from the Carolinas . <p> Favas are also elusive . They 're hard to find even at the start of their season , and become more so as the heat travels up the Atlantic coast  --  which only adds to their desirability . All this is an incredible nuisance for the home cook without access to fancy produce purveyors  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good places to start . ( Like a lot of trendy things , favas are a little easier to find in the New York area : the Fresh Fields/Whole Foods chain sells more there ; and author/restaurateur Peck has found them in her local supermarket in Connecticut . ) <p> There is , natch , a down side to featuring favas on a restaurant menu . For one thing , their unique taste  --  some describe it as slightly bitter , others as metallic  --  is unfamiliar to Americans , and some people shy away from them . " There was a time when I thought putting favas on a plate was an absolute risk  --  and I certainly think we 've moved beyond that , " says Cashion 's Eat Place chef Ann Cashion , who 's been featuring them seasonally since the restaurant opened two years ago . <p> This year , Cashion tried an experiment and served roast duck with pureed favas without identifying them on the menu . " People could n't figure out what the dish was , which said a lot to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . Instead , it was kind of a jolt to people . They did eat and enjoy them , but I did n't get ' oh my god , I 've never had fresh favas before . These are so delicious . ' " <p> A second problem has to do with preparation time : favas are very labor intensive . First the beans have to be removed from their pods , and then from a second individual inner skin , which traditionally is done with a knife . " It probably takes four or five hours for us to clean a case , " says Obelisk 's Pastan . " It 's a real pain . " <p> Another way to remove the inner shells is to blanch the individual beans , once they 've been removed from the pod . In that scenario , they are dropped into boiling water briefly , then plunged into ice water , and the skins slip off more easily . Once blanched , however , they go bad quickly . " It 's better to peel them , " says Susan McCreight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start getting yellow after blanching  --  and really slimy . " <p> And that disillusions some chefs , no matter how crazy they are about favas . But faced with fava fatigue , resourceful chefs have an alternative  --  they can always move on to the next trend . <p> Greggory Hill , executive chef at Gabriel in Dupont Circle , finally gave up on favas even though they were a crucial part of the relish ( roasted corn and mangoes with fava beans and truffle oil ) he made to accompany the restaurant 's pan-seared cilantro-jalapen o crab cakes . The labor involved in preparing them was one of the factors . Now he 's looking ahead . He 's substituted black barley for favas in the corn-mango relish . And he 's tinkering with other black legumes and grains  --  black garbanzos , black quinoa  --  in the hope of anticipating ( or creating ) the next trend . <p> Watch this space . <p> ORECCHIETTE AND FAVA BEAN SUMMER SALAD <p> ( 6 servings ) <p> From Yann Henrotte , corporate chef at B &B; Washington 's Caterers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oil for pasta-cooking water <p> 3 cups fresh orecchiette pasta <p> 1 1/2 pounds small or medium fresh fava beans in the pod <p> 8 cloves garlic , peeled <p> 10 ounces fresh spinach <p> 1/4 cup olive oil <p> 1 cup sun-dried tomatoes <p> 1/4 bunch fresh basil ( about 1/2 cup leaves loosely packed ) <p> 1 red bell pepper , stemmed , seeded and cut in julienne <p> 1/4 pound feta cheese , cubed <p> Freshly ground black pepper to taste <p> Fresh lemon juice to taste ( optional ) <p> Bring a medium-sized pot of water to a boil .
