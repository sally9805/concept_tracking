<p> Anthrax test success a breakthrough in battle to decontaminate biological weapons <p> The Clinton administration 's tense standoff with Saddam Hussein over United Nations inspections of suspected Iraqi weapons plants has underscored a terrible U.S. fear : Iraq has developed a massive biological warfare capability  --  and U.N . inspectors , despite a massive effort , have not been able to find or contain it . <p> But while political talks continue , American scientists have quietly proceeded with efforts to neutralize the threat of biological weapons by developing agents that could be used to combat deadly biological agents of war . <p> Researchers recently announced test results for a new decontaminant against anthrax and other significant biological warfare agents . Dr. James R. Baker Jr. , and his colleagues at the University of Michigan have found that their new product , known as BCTP , safely and effectively destroys a number of the most dangerous bacteria and viruses . In addition , a second team at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , has produced a new decontaminating foam that 's as nontoxic as hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think about killing viruses and bacteria and may help to reduce the terror and the threat of biological warfare , experts say . <p> Iraq has been dealing in the science of death for a long time . Anthrax , aflatoxin , botulism , gas gangrene and camelpox , among others , are agents Iraqi scientists are known to have developed . If the United States goes to war with Iraq soon , it will be over Iraq 's germ collection , not over Kuwaiti oil , defense experts predict . <p> Any soldiers who might go to Iraq have been vaccinated against anthrax , widely considered the most potent and dangerous biological weapon . But no vaccination offers complete protection . An aerosol bomb could deliver anthrax in quantities great enough to override any immunity , and could thoroughly contaminate equipment with almost indestructible anthrax spores . American officials also say that the Russians have developed vaccine-resistant anthrax strains ; it 's quite possible Iraq has as well . <p> So what does the U.S. Army have to decontaminate its tanks and guns and soldiers ? <p> Chlorine bleach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's toxic to people and animals as well as bacteria ; it rusts machines ; it denatures proteins ; and you need a lot of water to deliver it . And soaking guns and tanks in chlorine is n't the way the Army wants to handle its weapons . <p> Consequently , modern science has been seeking to produce an agent with bleach 's decontaminating power that could be spread on guns , poured onto clothes , sprayed into eyes and nostrils , rubbed into wounds and consumed . <p> At a recent meeting of the American Society for Microbiology , the Michigan researchers announced they had tested such a substance  --  BCTP  --  on live animals . Over a four-hour period , the fatty , bland solution  --  which you can drink like a milkshake or rub on your skin like sunscreen  --  killed up to 99.4 percent of anthrax bacteria in a test tube , the researchers said . That 's about the same effectiveness as concentrated bleach . In addition , Baker and his colleagues reported that rats fed BCTP actually gained weight . <p> BCTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , a Defense Department agency that funds unconventional research . Made from common materials  --  water , soybean oil , detergent and the solvent tri-n-butyl phosphate  --  it separates and dilutes the deadly agent , in much the same way dishwashing liquid breaks apart grease . The fatty lipids not only destroy the live anthrax bacteria , they also appear to " persuade " anthrax spores to open and begin to germinate , a process that allows more bacteria to grow . Then , like a Trojan horse , BCTP moves in for the kill . <p> " Spores are bioactive , " explained Baker , the director of the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan , who directed the project . " They are n't immutable rocks . If you can rehydrate them , you make them vulnerable again . " <p> And BCTP does n't work only against anthrax ; it is also effective against at least five other types of bacteria , including bacillus cereus , a close and usually harmless relative of bacillus anthracis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereus with anthrax to produce a vaccine-resistant anthrax that kills by bursting red blood cells , according to Paul J. Jackson of Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico . <p> In an experiment at the University of Michigan , rats that had wounds deliberately infected with bacillus cereus began to heal when BCTP was rubbed into the injury . Only 20 percent of the rodents treated with BCTP died , as opposed to 80 percent of the untreated infected animals . <p> BCTP also appears to work against so-called " envelope viruses , " whose living material is wrapped in a protein coating , including influenza , Ebola , smallpox and HIV . In less than half an hour , BCTP destroys the viral envelope and disorganizes the contents . <p> " If you disrupt the envelope , the virus is n't viable , " Baker said . <p> Dr. D. Craig Wright , chief research scientist at Novavax , first developed BCTP to combat the AIDS virus . He also discovered that sperm can be inactivated by BCTP . Wright is so convinced of the product 's safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contraceptive and hopes to start human clinical trials in the first quarter of 1999 . It could be available for use within two years , depending on regulatory reviews . <p> While effective in the laboratory , BCTP has never been tested as an environmental decontaminant  --  that is , sprayed on surfaces like a field or floor . But Wright expects such tests to begin soon . <p> Meanwhile , researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque have developed another product , a foam-based agent , that effectively decontaminates large areas as well as clothing and equipment . Formulated quite differently from BCTP , the Sandia foam works according to similar principles  --  denaturing viral envelopes and coaxing bacterial spores into germination . But unlike BCTP , you ca n't drink it or drop it in your eyes , said Dr. Maher Tadros , the foam 's developer . <p> Sandia researchers say their product , which has yet to be named , kills anthrax spores in less than four hours , which is faster than bleach . When sprayed on surfaces , the foam spreads quickly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But Tadros insists : " There is no competition . The more of these decontaminating agents we have , the better . " <p> Both products work on surfaces  --  skin , weapons , the floor of a school or subway . They kill bacteria or viruses before the diseases are introduced into the body . " Either the viral membrane is susceptible or it 's not , " Wright said . " If it 's susceptible , the organism ca n't change the membrane , because you 've just killed it . " <p> Once a person is infected , however , it 's difficult to know whether these new agents could do any good , although it 's possible that drinking BCTP could kill any disease agents introduced into the body through contaminated food , specialists say . University of Michigan experiments with mice demonstrate that BCTP kills the flu virus in living animals . But it ca n't be introduced intravenously : BCTP disrupts red blood cells as readily as it does viruses . <p> Dr. Shaun Jones , DARPA 's Project Director for Unconventional Pathogen Countermeasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is optimistic about BCTP 's promise as a wide-ranging decontaminant . <p> " I want to be as rigorous as possible , " Jones said . " I do n't want to portray this as a magic bullet or a panacea , but I think it will be a very powerful tool .
