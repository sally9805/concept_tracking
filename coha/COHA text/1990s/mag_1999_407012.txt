Doug Swisher 's radical method seems all backward // If you 've played baseball , you will become a power flycaster quicker . This is an indisputable truth , according to Doug Swisher . Swisher might be best known for his writings on trout and entomology with Carl Richards , but he is also one of the nation 's top flycasters , and for the past dozen or so years , he 's run a camp huddled back near the mangroves in Naples , Fla. ( 941-793-7438 ) . Swisher and his staff are at the opposite end of the spectrum from the traditional " hold a book tucked under your arm " school of flycasting . " I 'll tell anyone who 's ever thrown a ball to continue that arm-follows-wrist motion when they 're casting , " says Swisher . " Once a person gets his arm moving , the next thing is the arm/wrist snap . That 's the power application , no matter what anybody else says . " , The curriculum at Swisher School puts the emphasis on yet another heretical direction : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rear power application , so Swisher recommends perfecting a good backcast before even starting to worry about the forward cast . On these pages , you 'll learn the why and how of making an expert backcast . And for good measure , we 've thrown in some of the special workouts Doug Swisher has devised to develop and strengthen muscle memory for casting . Swisher brings physics as well as baseball into his theory . He notes that at the start of a backcast , the combination of acceleration , the friction of the line coming off the water and the weight of the line causes the rod to " load " ( bend ) . This bend effectively shortens the rod , from , say , 9 feet to about 81/2 feet . If you do not raise the pivot point of the rod ( your wrist ) to compensate for the " shorter " rod , your fly line can not travel in a straight path backward . At best , that means a loss of power on the backcast , which means a loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the line starts traveling at an angle to the rest of the line , and a wide , sloppy loop is formed , which drains off still more energy . The point is to keep the fly line traveling in as straight a path as possible on both the backcast and the forward cast in order to develop and conserve the energy the rod is creating . // Backcast // Backcast-Shoot Exercise // Horizontal Exercise Wrist-Strengthening Exercise I Wrist-Strengthening Exercise II // <p>
