Last March , a man who was driving a snowmobile over the frozen surface of Montana 's Holter Reservoir plunged through the ice . Seconds later , a friend who was hurrying to help also broke through . Rushing back to shore , two ice fishermen found a rope with a few Styrofoam buoys attached and , as the ice creaked beneath their boots , ran to where the men had disappeared . They managed to haul the second victim , John Baker , back onto the ice , and proceeded to crawl toward the shore , dragging him with the rope . But when they were still 200 yards out , the ice collapsed under their combined weight . As the three fell into the water , the rescuers felt Baker , who was already weakened by hypothermia , slip through their grasp . Fighting now to save their own lives , the men hauled themselves back onto the ice shelf and managed to crawl to safety . This tragedy occurred in the same part of the reservoir where my brother and I had taken our sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain drawn to the faces of lakes stilled by winter , this made me wonder if it was worth the risk to ever venture onto the ice again . Every year lives are lost to thin ice . In Minnesota alone , more than 130 people have died in ice accidents in the past eighteen years , and the Great Lakes claim fishermen every winter . Many of these tragedies could have been averted if the anglers had taken a few precautions . Before anyone steps onto frozen water , other steps should be taken : First , you should pick up the phone before you pack your auger . Fire departments , sheriff 's offices , fish and game agencies , and sporting goods stores usually know the conditions of ice on local bodies of water . They can tell you where inlet currents or springs form weak areas that may not be apparent on the surface . Lakes do n't freeze at the same rate . One may be safe to walk on by Christmas , but another , which holds growths of foxtail or lilies that decompose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might not freeze solid for another month . Even the activities of fish can produce weak ice . Schools of carp can create thin spots by circulating water with their fins . Ice is generally considered to be safe to walk upon if it is 4 inches thick , to snowmobile on at 5 inches , and to drive on in a car or small pickup at 8 inches . But these are general guidelines for new ice , which is much stronger and more elastic than ice that is refrozen , or has been formed from snow freezing or water bubbling up through cracks in old ice . Spring ice that has been honeycombed by the rays of the sun is notoriously unstable no matter how thick it is . The ice on Holter Reservoir , which was rotted through by the spring thaw , was 5 inches thick where it gave way to the weight of the two men last March . Although ice is difficult to judge by appearance , black , clear ice is generally thinner than whitish ice that is peppered with air bubbles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be judged by observing the cracks that have formed in it . After ice is covered by snow , it 's a good idea to carry a spud bar or heavy walking stick to tamp in front of you as you proceed . Changes in sound indicate that the ice has changed , and that should be taken as a warning . Thin ice has a resonating tone . Rotted spring ice creaks and sounds spongy underfoot . Safe ice makes a solid dull thump when tamped . Depressions in the snow may indicate areas where water is circulating nearer the surface and should be avoided . Pressure ridges , which occur where expanding panes of ice press together , create weak seams that can occasionally open , leaving narrow alleys of water that can be hidden by a cover of snow . A fisheries biologist I know fell into one of these seams and kept himself from going under by wedging his elbows onto the pressure ridges . He was able to extricate himself with little difficulty , but most who crack through will find themselves in a life or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords no handhold and often collapses under the weight of their arms . When I was a boy I fell through the ice on a strip mine pit in Ohio . Although the water was only waist deep , I could not grip the ice to haul myself up . Panicking , I grabbed for the sheath knife strapped to my hip and used its point to chip out a series of fingerholds . In retrospect , I know that the knife , which I carried only for show , might have saved my life . Better than a knife , if a bit more cumbersome to carry , is a pair of sawed-off broomstick handles tipped with sharpened nails and connected to each other with a length of string . With them , you can walk your way back onto the ice hand over hand . Remember to turn around and face the direction you came from before trying to get back onto the ice ; that is where it is likely to be thicker . If the ice does break away , keep kicking forward until you reach a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on top of the ice , do n't attempt to stand . Roll or crawl toward safer ice , keeping your weight dispersed over a wide area . This advice applies equally to would-be rescuers . The very worst thing a person can do upon seeing someone fall through the ice is rush toward the victim to embrace a similar fate , as John Baker did last year at Holter Reservoir . Instead , approach cautiously by crawling forward , then toss a rope with a life preserver ( it 's always wise to wear one when ice fishing ) , buoy , or stick attached toward the victim . In a pinch , branches from the shoreline or even jumper cables from a car trunk can be thrown or extended to someone who is in trouble . Anyone who falls through the ice will quickly develop hypothermia and has at most 30 minutes to function before falling comatose . If you are fortunate enough to climb onto the safety of the ice , but are alone and far from help , build a fire the moment you reach shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , override any objections they might have to your help . My brother , who is an emergency room physician , stresses that people suffering from hypothermia often become confused and may think and actually feel as if they are all right . They are not . Get them dry and warmed up at the nearest heated shanty or in a car with the heater roaring . If you are close to a home , help them into a bathtub of warm water ( 110 degrees is the ideal ) . Victims who have nearly drowned or been in the water for a long time may need CPR . It 's critical that they be treated gingerly . If possible , attend to their needs while they are lying down . Once the body 's core temperature falls below 90 degrees , the victim may go into cardiac arrest , which can be precipitated by rough handling , such as trying to hoist someone to his feet . One further word of caution applies to the elderly . The National Institute on Aging estimates that within a year of their accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bad falls die of complications following surgery . Women who suffer from osteoporosis are particularly suseptible to hip fractures , and probably should refrain from venturing onto the ice . Stubborn oldtimers can buy cane icepicks at surgical stores . When used in conjunction with ice creepers strapped to the boots , they greatly increase stability . Keep in mind that you do n't have to fall through the ice to be counted as its victim . ICE-FISHING CHECKLIST 1 . Insulated clothing . Snowmobile suits can trap air and slow down heat loss in case of immersion . Those with inflatable flotation elements are the best choice . 2 . A 50-foot nylon rope wrapped around a bleach bottle . This takes up little space and can be thrown to a victim who has broken through the ice . 3 . A pair of broom handles cut short and tipped with sharpened nails . These will grip the ice and greatly increase your chances of hauling yourself back on top . Keep them in a jacket pocket , attached to each other with a length of string . 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * When I asked an officer of Montana 's Department of Health for recommendations for driving on ice , he said , " My rule of thumb is to stay off the damned ice . " That is advice I have taken to heart , but for those who are devoted motorists , these tips may help save your life . * Unbuckle your safety belt and roll down the car windows before driving on ice . If your car cracks through , water pressure wo n't permit you to escape otherwise . * Hold the side doors open as you drive . The doors will catch on the ice should the wheels break through and stop or delay the car from sinking . * Parking a vehicle in one spot tends to weaken the surrounding ice . Move from time to time to allow the ice to resume its normal position . * Try to avoid parking cars close together , driving in tandem , or following well-worn routes to ice-fishing hotspots where the surface may be weakened by excessive pressure . * Drive slowly except on ice covering very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " action caused by cars may crack the ice if the vehicle is moving at a " critical speed " ( see table ) . ( Table omitted ) Your driving speed should be either faster or slower than the critical velocity , preferably slower . * Never drive on the ice at night . <p>                     @x Winfield , West Virginia July 26 , 1959 <p> Lark <p> I move his chair into the yard under the tree and then Nonie carries him out . The tree is getting all full of seeds and the pods hang down . Soon enough the seeds will fly through the air and Nonie will have hay fever and want all the windows shut to keep the white puffs out . Termite will want to be outside in the chair all the time then , and he 'll go on and on at me if I try to keep him indoors so I can do the ironing or clean up the dishes . Sun or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially . " OK , you 're out , " Nonie will say , and he starts his sounds , quiet and satisfied , before she even puts him down . She has on her white uniform to go to work at Charlie 's and she holds Termite out from her a ways , not to get her stockings run with his long toenails or her skirt stained with his fingers because he always has jam on them after breakfast . <p> " There 's Termite . " Nonie puts him in the chair with his legs under him like he always sits . Anybody else 's legs would go to sleep , all day like that . " You keep an eye on him , Lark , " Nonie tells me , " and give him some lemonade when it gets warmer . You can put the radio in the kitchen window . That way he can hear it from out here too . " Nonie straightens Termite . " Get him one of those cleaner-bag ribbons from inside . I got to go , Charlie will have my ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Termite blares too then , trying to sound like the horn . " Elise is here , " Nonie says . " Do n't forget to wash the dishes , and wipe off his hands . " She 's already walking off across the grass , but Termite is outside so he does n't mind her going . Elise waves at me from inside her Ford . She 's a little shape in the shine of glare on the window , then the gravel crunches and they 're moving off fast , like they 're going somewhere important . " Termite , " I say to him , and he says it back to me . He always gets the notes right , without saying the words . His sounds are like a one-toned song , and the day is still and flat . It 's seven in the morning and here and there a little bit of air moves , in pieces , like a tease , like things are getting full so slow no one notices . On the kitchen wall we have one of those glass vials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's going to storm . The water is all the way to the top and it 's like a test now to wait and see if the thing works , or if it 's so cheap it 's already broken . " Termite , " I tell him , " I 'll fix the radio . Do n't worry . " He 's got to have something to listen to . He moves his fingers the way he does , with his hands up and all his fingers pointing , then curving , each in a separate motion , fast or careful . He never looks at his fingers but I always think he hears or knows something through them , like he does it for some reason . Charlie says he 's just spastic , that 's a spastic motion ; Nonie says he 's fidgety , with whatever he has that he ca n't put to anything . His fingers never stop moving unless we give him something to hold , then he holds on so tight we have to pry whatever it is away from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he holds something his fingers rest . He does n't always want to keep hearing things . <p> My nightgown is so thin I should n't be standing out here , though it 's not like it matters . Houses on both sides of the alley have seen about everything of one another from their secondfloor windows . No one drives back here but the people who live here , who park their cars in the gravel driveways that run off the alley . We do n't have a car , but the others do , and the Tuccis have three-two that run and one that does n't . It 's early summer and the alley has a berm of plush grass straight up the center . All us kids-Joey and Solly and Zeke and me-walked the grass barefoot in summer , back and forth to one another 's houses . I pulled Termite in the wagon and the wheels fit perfectly in the narrow tire tracks of the alley . Nick Tucci still calls his boys thugs , proud they 're quick and tough . He credits Nonie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were small . <p> Today is Sunday . Nick Tucci will run his push mower along the berm of the alley , to keep the weeds down . He does it after dusk , when he gets home from weekend overtime at the factory and he 's had supper and beer , and the grass smells like one sharp green thread sliced open . I bring Termite out . He loves the sound of that mower and he listens for it , once all the way down , once back . He makes a low murmur like r ' s strung together , and he has to listen hard over the sounds of other things , electric fans in windows , radio sounds , and he sits still and I give him my sandals to hold . He looks to the side like he does , his hands fit into my shoes . Hiseyes stay still , and he hears . If I stand behind his chair I can feel the blade of the mower too ; I feel it roll and turn way down low in me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as a year . Sundays I do n't walk up Kanawha Hill to Main Street to Barker Secretarial . I 'm nearly through second semester , Typing and Basic Skills , but I 'm First of Class and Miss Barker lets me sit in on Steno with the second-year girls . Miss Barker is not young . She 's a never-married lady who lives in her dead father 's house and took over the school for him when he died of a heart attack about ten years ago . The school is up above the Five &amp; Ten , on the second floor of the long building with the long red sign that says in gold letters murphy 's five and ten cent store . It 's a really old sign , Nonie says , it was there when she and my mother were growing up , but the store was both floors then . Now Barker Secretarial has filled the big upstairs room with lines of Formica-topped desks , each with a pullout shelf where we keep our typing books ( Look to the right , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have to be on time because the drills are timed and we turn on our machines all at once ; there 's a ratchety click and a rumble , like the whole room surges , then it hums . The typewriters hum one note : it 's a note Termite could do , but what would he do with the sound of us typing . We all work at one speed for practice drills . We 're like a chorus and the clacking of the keys sounds measured , all together . Then at personal best we go for speed and all the rates are different . The machines explode with noise , running over themselves . Up near the big windows , for half the room , there 's a lowered fake ceiling with long fluorescent lights . The tops of the windows disappear in that ceiling and I hate it and I sit in the back . Barker Secretarial stopped with the ceiling halfway when they realized they did n't have the money for air-conditioning , and they brought in big fans that roll on wheels like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans going and we all have to wear scarves to keep our hair from flying around . With the noise and the motion I can think I 'm high up , moving fast above the town and the trees and the river and the bridges , and as long as I 'm typing I wo n't crash . <p> I tell Termite , " It 's not going to rain yet . He 'll still mow the alley . There 's not going to be stars though . It 's going to be hot and white , and the white sky will go gray . Then really late we might have that big storm they talk about . " <p> Big storm they talk about , Termite says back to me , in sounds like my words . <p> " That 's right , " I tell him . " But you 'll have to watch from the window . Do n't think you 're going to sit out here in the rain with lightning flashing all around you . " <p> He does n't say anything to that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rain , real hard rain , not like the summer rain we let him sit out in sometimes . He likes motion . He likes things on his skin . He 's alive all over that way . Nonie says I put thoughts in his head , he might not be thinking anything . Maybe he does n't have to think , I tell her . Just do n't you be thinking a lot of things about him that are n't true , she 'll say . <p> But no one can tell what 's true about him . <p> Termite was pretty when he was a baby . People would coo over him when we walked him in the big carriage . His forehead was real broad and he had blond curls and those blue eyes that move more than normal , like he 's watching something we do n't see . He was so small for his age that Nonie called him a mite , then Termite , because even then he moved his fingers , feeling the air . I think he 's in himself like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Termite came . Nonie is his guardian and his aunt , but I 'm his sister . In a way he 's more mine than anyone else 's . He 'll be mine for longer , is what Nonie says . Nonie is n't old but she always says to me about when she 'll be gone . She looks so strong , like a block or a rectangle , strong in her shoulders and her back and her wide hips , even in her legs and their blue veins that she covers up with her stockings . Your mother did n't bring him , is what Nonie told me , someone brought him for her . Not his father . Nonie says Termite 's father was only married to my mother for a year . He was a baby , Nonie says , twenty-one when my mother was nearly thirty , and those bastards left him over there in Korea . No one even got his body back and they had to have the service around a flag that was folded up . Nonie says it was wrong and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Termite got here because Nonie sent me away that week to church camp . I was nine and had my birthday at camp , and when I came home Termite was here . He was nearly a year old but he could n't sit up by himself , and Nonie had him a baby bed and clothes and a high chair with cushions and straps , and she had papers that were signed . She never got a birth certificate though , so we count the day he came his birthday , but I make him a birthday whenever it suits me . <p> " Today could be a birthday , " I tell him . " One with a blue cake , yellow inside , and a lemon taste . You like that kind , with whipped cream in the center , to celebrate the storm coming , and Nick Tucci will get some with his ice tea tonight , and I 'll help you put the candles in . You come inside with me while I mix it and you can hold the radio . You can turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OK . I can almost answer for him . But I do n't . And he does n't , because he does n't want to come inside . I can feel him holding still ; he wants to sit here . He puts his hand up to his face , to his forehead , as though he 's holding one of the strips of blue plastic Nonie calls ribbons : that 's what he wants . " There 's no wind , Termite , no air at all , " I tell him . He blows with his lips , short sighs . <p> So I move his chair back from the alley a bit and I go inside and get the ribbon , a strip of a blue plastic dry-cleaner bag about four inches wide and two feet long . It 's too small to get tangled and anyway we watch him ; I take it out to him and wrap it around his hand twice and he holds it with his fingers curled , up to his forehead . " I 'll get dressed and clean up the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the cake you 're going to have to come inside , OK ? " <p> He casts his eyes sideways at me . That means he agrees , but he 's thinking about the blue , that strip of space he can move . <p> " You ring the bell if you want anything , " I say . <p> The bell on his chair was my idea ; it 's really a bell for a hotel desk , flat , and he can press the knob with his wrist . That bell was mounted on a piece of metal with holes , maybe so no one would steal it once upon a time , or so it would n't get misplaced . A lot of years ago , I sewed it to the arm of Termite 's chair with thick linen cord . His bell has a high , nice sound , not a bad sound . He presses it twice if he has to go to the bathroom , or a lot if something is wrong , or sometimes just once , now and then in the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell him , " I 'm going back in . " <p> Back in , back in , back in . I hear him as I walk away , and now he 'll be silent as a breather , quiet as long as I let him be . <p> I stand at the kitchen sink where I can see him , put the stopper in the sink , run the water as hot as it can get . The smell of the heat comes up at my face . The dishes sink into suds , and I watch Termite . His chair is turned a little to the side , and I can see him blowing on the ribbon , blowing and blowing it , not too fast . The little bit of air that stirs in the yard catches the length of that scrap and moves it . Termite likes the blue of the plastic and he likes to see through it . He blows it out from his face and he watches it move , and it barely touches him , and he blows it away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till you take it away from him . In my dreams he does it for days , for years , like he 's keeping time , like he 's a clock or a watch . I draw him that way , fast , with pencil in my notebook . Head up like he holds himself then , wrist raised , moving blue with his breath . <p> People who see him from their second-story windows see a boy in a chair across the alley . They know his name and who he is . They know Noreen and how she 's worked at Charlie Fitzgibbon 's all these years , running the restaurant with Charlie while Gladdy Fitzgibbon owns it all and parcels out the money . How Nonie is raising kids alone that are n't hers because Charlie has never told his mother to shove it , never walked off and made himself some other work and gone ahead and married a twice-divorced woman with a daughter and another kid who ca n't walk and does n't talk . <p> Nonie is like my mother . When she introduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Lark . " <p> Nonie would be raising us anyway , whether Charlie ever did the right thing or not . And I do n't know if she even wants him to , anymore . It 's just Nonie should own part of that restaurant , hard as she works . Charlie does the cooking and runs the kitchen , and Nonie does everything else , always has , ever since she came back here when she left the second husband . She came back and there was Charlie right where she 'd left him , living with his mother and going to Mass , and they fell right back into their old ways , and Gladdy fell into hers . Except the Fitzgibbons had just about nothing after the Depression . When Nonie came back , they 'd barely held on to their house and the business . They would have lost the restaurant if Nonie had n't saved it for them , <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>                    @
