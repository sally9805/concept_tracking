<p> PUEBLO - It 's sauce day . A white apron wrapped high on his waist , Jo Jo Concialdi is throwing " a little of this , a little of that " into pots simmering on the stove of the Branch Inn on South Union Avenue . <p> Nothing is measured . Nothing written down . As a boy , he learned to cook by watching his mother in this kitchen . His recipes will never be recorded or even repeated out loud . <p> Joseph A. Concialdi , known to everyone in town as Jo Jo , is going to the grave with his recipes . And his secrets . <p> Concialdi lives by omerta , the Mafia code of silence . He will die by omerta . <p> He 's a mobster , presumed to be retired . Concialdi is Pueblo 's , and maybe Colorado 's , last Mafia don . <p> The man who ran the town by corrupting Pueblo 's police department 25 years ago now cooks in the afternoon for the dinner crowd and watches the bar for his daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has passed . Traditional organized crime is now more legend than reality . In the age of the Bloods and the Crips , the mob is n't much of a bogeyman . Gangland killings are seen on movie screens , not newscasts . <p> But what Concialdi knows could hang a lot of judges , politicians and cops . Or so he says . <p> " I could tell you some stories , " says Concialdi . " These crooked politicians and judges , they all hang together like a bunch of grapes . The cops know some stuff , but not everything . " <p> At 71 , Concialdi is only five pounds heavier than the 145 he weighed when he was a star cornerback at Central High School . He 's proud of that , proud of his family , proud of his heritage . <p> Political correctness is not a big concern in Pueblo . The word " Wop " is commonly used in polite company , as is " Bojon " for people of Slavic origin . <p> " Hey , I do n't mind the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Concialdi says . <p> A Sicilian knows the rules . Omerta . <p> But much of Jo Jo 's story was told for him , in court . <p> Concialdi bribed cops to " lose " traffic tickets and was accused of procuring illegal abortions . He rigged entrance and promotional tests for city cops . He claims he could have made a phone call most places in Colorado and gotten a problem - say with the parole board or a city councilman - fixed . <p> He did n't always pay his taxes , and he failed to tell the grand jury the truth on a number of occasions . <p> Thirty years ago , Union Avenue was really " humming , " as Jo Jo says . " It was fun . There was a lot going on . The women . The gambling . Everyone was moving around this part of Colorado . " <p> U.S. steel was king in those days . Pueblo brimmed with 6,000 steelworkers . <p> Concialdi brokered services . You had trouble , he could fix it - for a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with a kid and a traffic ticket . <p> In April 1971 , 17-year-old Ronald Carreon got a speeding ticket . He 'd heard that Concialdi could fix it , so he went to Jo Jo at the Branch Inn and paid him $ 65 . Later , he was told the price of a fix had risen to $ 350 . Carreon called his family from the tavern . His dad drove over and confronted Concialdi . <p> Jo Jo was convicted in 1973 of two felony charges on the ticket-fixing beef and found guilty of perjury before the grand jury . <p> Meanwhile , Concialdi triggered a backlash against himself by trying to kick-start an investigation of some cops who were hassling him . He returned stolen police records he 'd been given illegally by the cops to their chief , who turned around and ordered a new investigation of Jo Jo . Later , the lid came off Jo Jo 's biggest scam when two more cops turned on him and his cousin , Mary Ann Wurster . The officers testified that Concialdi and Wurster had rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jo Jo , who guaranteed them a good score . In return , the cops would owe him . <p> Wurster was the linchpin . A secretary at the civil service commission , she graded - and altered - the police tests at Jo Jo 's behest . <p> Patrolman John Rusick turned on the cousins . He told the grand jury he paid Jo Jo $ 500 to rig his entrance test in 1969 . Rusick finished No. 1 . His admission triggered a department-wide investigation . Both Concialdi and Wurster eventually went to prison for the caper . <p> Sgt. John Koncilja , a cop who played a major role in short-circuiting Jo Jo 's career , remembers Judge Thomas Phelps saying to Wurster when he sentenced her , " You have done more damage to the American way of life in your tenure at the civil service commission than the Communist Party had done in 40 years . " <p> Rusick , who saved himself from prosecution by testifying , resigned from the police department . A wave of other officers retired or took medical leaves after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says former District Attorney Joe Losavio , who counts Concialdi 's three-year residence in a Canon City prison as a major victory in his career . " Some very young guys retired . " <p> Though Concialdi is seen by much of Pueblo as a sort of a harmless throwback , Losavio and Koncilja have a different view . The two men spent the early ' 70s chasing Jo Jo . <p> " When you have a corrupt police department , you have chaos , " says Losavio . " This investigation restored the integrity of the police . " <p> Sitting in the Irish Pub , a downtown Pueblo watering hole for politicians , reporters and off-duty law officers , old friends Koncilja and Losavio smoke cigars and tell some of their Jo Jo stories . Dressed in Armani , just out of his Lexus , Losavio is a trial attorney from central casting . Koncilja , burly in leather and jeans , looks with his silver hair the way a Boston pol should . <p> Twenty years later , they can laugh , a little . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long-lasting repercussions . <p> " I was a victim of the test scam , " says Koncilja . " Every time I tried for promotion , I could n't score . " <p> Jo Jo wo n't cop to that , but he knows Koncilja well . " Yeah . We used to call him the Eternal Corporal , " he says . " He just was n't one of our guys . He never advanced . " <p> That said , Jo Jo , looking remarkably innocent , adds , " Those were fun times . " <p> Koncilja agrees with his old opponent . " Actually that time , when I was on the ( Colorado Organized Crime ) Strike Force investigating Jo Jo and others , was really happy , " he says . " I think we did good work . " <p> They shut Jo Jo down , no question . <p> Though Jo Jo spent a lot of time in front of grand juries , he was n't always guilty as accused . In June 1973 , he was implicated in a gambling raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene L. " Checkers " Smaldone , among others . <p> Jo Jo claimed he was the victim of mistaken identity . <p> " Oh , boy , that one made me mad , " Concialdi says with the heat of unaccustomed innocence . " I knew I was n't there . I 'd remember if I was . But I could n't think where I was until Peg ( his late wife ) reminded me we were at a rosary for my cousin . " <p> The charges were dropped . <p> As for rigging the police tests , Concialdi did his time in the pen rather than take a sweet deal from Losavio . <p> " I would have cut him a hell of a deal , " says Losavio , now in private practice . " It would have been worth it to hear what Jo Jo knew . There was an enormous web of corruption around him , and we could have gotten even more if he 'd talked . <p> " We 'd heard for years that Jo Jo kept a ledger of every deal made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Losavio 's offer , then stepped into the hall with his attorney , Vasco Seavy , and formed his answer : " No . You tell that son of a bitch ' No . " ' <p> True to his form , Seavy repeated his client 's comments verbatim to Losavio and Jo Jo went to prison , though not right away . <p> Losavio regards the jailing of Concialdi as a triumph , but he knows how smart his old enemy is . <p> " I 'm still not sure that every tainted cop was taken out of the department , " says Losavio . " I 'm not sure that this corruption did n't extend far beyond the police , but he would n't tell us anything . " <p> No bumpkin , Concialdi had appeal after appeal filed by Seavy , who is still remembered for defending another client accused of murder by pointing out : " No one saw the bullet leave the gun . " <p> Motions were heard . Accusations were thrown out . Concialdi was in the courts for years fighting various charges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1975 . He came out in May 1978 . <p> It was n't exactly hard time . Jo Jo says he lived in the warden 's home . <p> " Even in jail , it 's who you know , " he says . <p> Jo Jo knows everyone . And everyone knows Jo Jo . The city liquor-licensing board even let him go back to work at the Branch Inn when he was still on parole . The testimony in support of Jo Jo took note of his " dignity " and his " essentially nonviolent " offenses . <p> John A. Salas , now a Pueblo insurance agent , was a reporter who covered Concialdi . " Pueblo is forgiving , " says Salas . " Jo Jo is a kind of legend . He 's looked on as a character . " <p> Even Pueblo Sheriff Dan Corsentino says , " I think he 's just aging gracefully in the restaurant . " <p> If you ask Koncilja , that may or may not be true . " Always keep an eye on these guys . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just making sure . " <p> Old enemies never quit watching each other . The tabs are still kept . <p> Jo Jo wants to know the news of Losavio and Koncilja . " Is Losavio still married to the blond ? How does Johnny look ? " <p> Jo Jo 's charm has served him well in the restaurant business , but sometimes not in court . <p> In 1972 , he was testifying before a grand jury on allegations of bribing police officers , ticket-fixing , burglary , receiving stolen property , gambling and procuring an illegal abortion . His attorney tried to shake two witnesses in the abortion case . <p> Neither woman had seen Concialdi for five years when they identified him in photos , but both picked him out , without hesitation . <p> " He has a magnetic personality that you remember , " said the first . <p> The other witness said she had no problem identifying him because " he was so friendly . " <p> Leopards and old dons do n't entirely change their spots . Jo Jo is still the consummate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bar . He loves women , sports , horses and jets . <p> His friends say he 's a little lonely . He spends a lot of time in the kitchen - you can see both the restaurant and bar from there . Cronies , cousins and customers come and go . He 's on the pay phone constantly . Peg has been dead for nearly five years . <p> Concialdi will not be leaving an organization behind . His son , a tennis pro , will not follow in his footsteps . <p> In crime , as in business , markets change . Loan sharking is n't what it used to be . Sexual mores changed and amateurs started cutting into the prostitution business . So much gambling is legal now that the underworld market is drying up . Drug running has always been considered declasse by traditional Mafia families . Nowadays the size of a computer chip carries more clout than the caliber of a gun . <p> Jo Jo 's a bit of a historian . He takes exception with Joanne Dodds , an author of Pueblo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district . <p> " She does n't know , " Jo Jo says , disgusted . " In that last book of hers she 's got the whores on Union Avenue waving their handkerchiefs to guys who got off trains during the war . That 's not right . I 've been around here since I was a kid . I had to come down here and sweep out this bar every morning for my brother Sab , since I was 13 . " <p> The 13-year-old figured out how to steal his big bother 's car , drive to the bar and then return it before Sabio got up in the morning . <p> Mrs. Concialdi spent a lot of time telling Jo Jo to stay away from bars and out of trouble . He did n't . On his block alone lived 13 bootleggers . <p> " You always knew when someone was ' cooking , " ' he says . " They 'd get an old rubber tire from the junkyard and burn it to cover the smell of the cooking mash . You knew someone 's auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He can describe the prostitutes and bootleggers as vividly as if he still waved to them every day , instead of to the shopkeepers in his gentrified neighborhood . He does n't mind the herb shops and the fancy florists and the chi-chi coffeehouses . <p> But sometimes he misses the wise guys and characters , the sports figures and cigar smokers . " We used to have more fun in the old days . You 'd see people around here all hours of the day and night , " he says . <p> Jo Jo is alone in the dark afternoon hours watching the O.J. Simpson trial on the bar 's television . <p> He 's willing to wait to see if O.J. is innocent . " That 's the American way . Innocent until proven guilty . But to hit a woman , I du n no . That 's just not a man . " <p> The precise translation of omerta is " to act like a man . "
