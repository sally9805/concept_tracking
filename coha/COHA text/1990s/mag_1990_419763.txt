PAIN RELIEF Where to go to get the best treatment available <p> One out of every seven of us can expect to battle arthritis in our lifetime . That means that one in seven of us will be looking for the best arthritis care we can find . The question is : To find the best , where should we look ? <p> The answer is : It depends . Arthritis comes in many forms and degrees . The best treatment for routine problems may be found in a few simple visits to your family physician or rheumatologist . Not-so-routine problems may demand a trip to a highly specialized center . <p> One thing is certain : You can be guaranteed the best care possible by contacting one of the arthritis centers designated to receive research funds from the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ( NIAMS ) . A number of outstanding centers and clinics across the United States compete for these funds . Those chosen represent the paradigm of state-of-the-art care and treatment , says Julia Freeman , Ph.D. , NIAMS centers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must demonstrate the deepest commitment to most , if not all , of the following components : <p> Basic and clinical research : To qualify to become a NIAMS center , medical research must be of the highest quality . " When laboratory investigators work side-by-side with clinicians , knowledge can be rapidly translated into new treatments , " says John B. Winfield , M.D. , director of the University of North Carolina 's arthritis center . <p> That can be of particular benefit to patients with difficult or serious conditions who may find treatments or diagnostic procedures here that are unavailable elsewhere . Past studies that NIAMS supported determined the cause of Lyme disease and of gout , which in turn led to the development of effective treatments for those diseases . <p> Experts from multiple disciplines : One leading arthritis expert calls it one-stop shopping  --  and he 's not talking about your local shopping mall . " The growing trend is to locate rheumatology , orthopedics and rehabilitation under the same roof , " says Roland Moskowitz , M.D. , director of the arthritis division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment , you no longer need to make 10 visits to 10 different experts . ' Then one physician , usually a rheumatologist , can synthesize all this expertise and design an individualized program . <p> Specialists who treat " nothing but " : There 's a lot to be said for seeing a doctor who 's a leading expert in your particular ailment . While NIAMS centers generally treat all forms of arthritis , they tend to superspecialize in two or more areas . These departments perpetuate their expert status by attracting future leaders in the field . <p> Innovative education for physicians : Education programs address questions like : How can we convince students training to be general practitioners that rheumatology would be a valuable elective ? And how can we help family doctors become more knowledgeable about rheumatology ? One program trains patients to be teachers in order to help medical-school students fine-tune their examination savvy . <p> After a typical arthritis examination , the patient evaluates the student 's performance . Doctors-to-be learn what to look for , how to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthritis treatment often requires that you , the patient , make changes in your approach to everyday activities . The more willing and able you are to share in the responsibility , the more lasting relief you 're likely to find . <p> One innovative program that promotes self-reliance is " Educize " at the Northwestern University Multipurpose Arthritis Center , in Chicago . " The session starts with a specially designed exercise class featuring light-impact aerobic dance routines , " explains Frank R. Schmid , M.D. , practicing physician and former rheumatology chief at Northwestern University Medical School . " What follows is a discussion period , where the class members and instructor share problem-solving strategies . Ultimately , patients learn to develop their own insights about the management of their disease . " <p> Improved services for patients : Health-service staffs look at patterns of how patients use various services . One of their goals is to provide better service at lower cost . WHEN TO GO TO A NIAMS CENTER <p> Because early diagnosis and treatment can head off permanent damage to joints and tissues , the NIAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease . <p> But because of their expertise and comprehensiveness , NIAMS centers tend to see mostly the most difficult and complex cases of arthritis . " Patients with difficult diagnoses or who demand complex treatments ought to be referred to a large center capable of providing multidisciplinary care , " says Dr. Moscowitz . " If you need a total hip replacement , for example , you do n't want to go to a place that does one a month . You want a surgeon who does them every day . " <p> That may mean you have to travel . The initial visit can take anywhere from half a day to several weeks . ( Biopsies and x-rays , for example , may require a stay of several days . ) Once you receive diagnosis and a treatment program is set , you may return home , where your primary physician can follow through with your treatment . <p> In addition to the NIAMS centers , there are excellent regional university centers , medical-school rheumatology divisions and non-university major clinics across the country that may be more convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician before you travel any distance . ROUTINE TREATMENT CLOSER TO HOME <p> Not all situations warrant the cost of travel , hotel stay and time off from work that a visit to a far-away large center incurs . Such a trip is only necessary in unusually difficult cases . If your condition is routine , there 's probably no need to travel farther than your family doctor 's office . <p> Many arthritic conditions fall in between routine and serious . ( One example would be rhemnatoid arthritis that does n't respond to standard therapy with anti-inflammatory analgesics like naproxen and ibuprofen . ) At that point , your family doctor may refer you to a board-certified rheumatologist . ( If he does n't , you may want to ask him about it . ) <p> In addition to medical school and three years of internal medicine , rheumatologists spend at least two years focusing specifically on diseases that affect the musculoskeletal system . It 's their job to keep up on the latest innovations in arthritis treatment . It 's quite common for a rheumatologist to design a treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there are many excellent rheumatologists , " there are also some physicians who are giving arthritis treatments that are not approved by the mainstream , " warns Naomi F. Rothfield , M.D. , chief , division of rheumatic diseases , University of Connecticut Health Center , in Farmington . <p> The Arthritis Foundation , a nonprofit , volunteer organization that works closely with NIAMS , may also help you locate physicians who specialize in treating arthritis .
