My Life I Did Myself : A talk by Elvia Alvarado . <p> Born and raised in rural Honduras , Elvia Alvarado has worked for over twenty years in Honduran women 's and peasants ' organizations . She prefers to be referred to as companera Elvia , which translates to " partner in struggle . " Alvarado is a founding member of FEHMUC , the Honduran Federation of Campesina Women , established in 1977 to create rural women 's cooperatives . Since its founding , FEHMUC has gained worldwide fame as an organizational model for grassroots women 's organizations . Alvarado is currently the head of International Relations for the Union of Rural Workers in Honduras . <p> Honduras is the poorest country in Central America , with the top 10% of the population receiving 50% of the net income , and the bottom 20% receiving 30% . Starting in 1980 , presidents Reagan and Bush considered Honduras crucial to maintaining U.S. control in Central America . It thus became the object of massive U.S. military aid . The availability of these funds led to wide-spread military corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , for the first time in Honduran history , human rights abuses - including disappearances , assassinations , secret detention centers and cemeteries , and the torture of prisoners - became common ( Global Exchange , fact sheet on Alvarado ) . <p> In her book , Do n't be Afraid Gringo : A Honduran Woman Speaks from the Heart , Alvarado tells the story of her growing awareness of women 's rights and the rights of the campesino peasants , along with her subsequent struggles as an activist and union organizer . Her work has also been featured in the PBS documentary Elvia and The Fight for Land and Liberty . As Alvarado became aware of the need to acquire land in order to fight the campesinos ' poverty , she helped organize marches , hunger strikes , and land occupations . By 1986 she had become one of the campesinos ' national spokespersons ( Global Exchange , fact sheet on Alvarado ) . As a result of her activities , Alvarado has received death threats and has been jailed and tortured several times by the Honduran military . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be Afraid Gringo is still not available in Spanish . <p> In the 1990 's , the U.S. changed its policy in Honduras from military control to an emphasis on privatization . In response to U.S. pressure , the Honduran government passed a law that promotes only individual land ownership . This law negates an earlier law that allowed campesino cooperatives some access to little-used land . Financial support for small farmers ' agencies has also been greatly reduced . ( Global Exchange fact sheet ) . <p> In the face of this new danger , Elvia Alvarado went on tour in the United States in fall 1993 to promote awareness of the campesinos ' struggle , both in terms of their history and of the struggle that lies before them . The following talk is a compilation of an interview that Alvarado gave at the University of Virginia Women 's Center in Charlottesville , Virginia on November 11 , 1993 and a talk and discussion at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Charlottesville , Virginia on November 10 . <p> I feel so much emotion to have the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the people of North America , because they do n't realize the suffering that we experience in Honduras and in all of Central America . <p> In my work I motivate the peasant women in Honduras . My work started from my own initiative and my own necessities as a woman . My name is Elvia Alvarado . I am a 54-year-old woman of Hikake Indian background . I am a single mother without a husband , and the mother of six children - four daughters and two sons . I am not a person who was formally educated . I repeated first and second grade six times and did n't finish primary school . <p> I am a campesina ( peasant ) woman . A campesina is a woman who lives far away from the cities , who lives in the rural areas . We live in the mountains , in the little abandoned hamlets . In the circle of poverty in which we live in Honduras we are the class that is least appreciated . We do n't live with any kind of standard of living . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't have work . The work we do have is manual work , it is very heavy . Even within the ( male ) campesino sector , the campesina woman has no rights . We work with the husband as he works the land , and then we come back and do the household duties . The campesina woman in Honduras is completely marginalized in society - marginalized from her home through her husband , and from the system in which she lives . <p> I sacrificed a lot to raise my children and had a lot of problem as a woman in my life . I was used a lot by men . They would just lay the children in me and then leave me alone without helping to raise them . Because of this , I had a bad image of men . My life I did myself . <p> My mother was very poor . She was abandoned with seven children . My dad worked on the land - he would sow corn and rice in rented lands . He did not have land himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were very small . Then my mom began to make tortillas and she would send us to the market to sell them . We would sell these tortillas to buy other things to eat . <p> My mother suffered a lot to raise us . We led a life of sacrifice and despair . During my childhood , I was a little girl without even a toy . In first grade I went to school with torn clothes , with patches on my clothes . If we could find work , than we as kids worked so we could else out a living . I was a very looked-down-upon child . Because of her poverty , even my mother looked down on us . She was not able to give us care ; she just gave us work . I was eighteen years old before I put on my first pair of shoes . <p> I had my fist child at fifteen . From that age on I was a mother with the responsibility of raising my child . I raised my child alone and I kept working , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I was pretty and I had another child . I was very naive ; I believed that men thought a lot of us , appreciated us . That was not true . Because when I became pregnant , they just looked down on me , and then they would run out on my life . I met another man , and I had four daughters with him . That is how I have six children . <p> Like me , the campesino women usually have a lot of children . The women of Honduras are not educated about having children , but they have as many kids as they can , to excess . So campesinos in Honduras need a lot more education . <p> But we look at the contraception pills that are sent from the U.S. as something that is imposed upon us . Because we think of Honduras as a country for us . It is a right of women to have children . The problem is not that we have children , the problem is that we do n't have territory . The territory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the North American transnational companies . When the United States built air force bases in Honduras there were campesino settlements there before . The campesinos were removed from those lands in order to build the North American air bases . The land that the North American companies have , those were our lands . We have enough land for children to be born , and for them to be raised with enough . So we think , " Why do they send me these contraceptives ? So they can invade our lands ? " <p> Before I was married , to make money to live , I had to leave my children alone at the house . I left the smallest children with the older children . My kids were alone and they cried . Sometimes I felt my children with my mother , and she watched them for me . During this time I worked in houses as a domestic servant . I earned very little . It was only enough for my mother to buy just a little bit of food for the children . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I worked very hard and I only earned 15 lempiras a month ( the equivalent of 2 U.S. dollars ) . <p> When I married , I do n't work outside of the house ; I just worked inside the house . I did the work in the house , like grinding corn , cleaning the house , washing laundry . While living with the man who was the father of my four daughters , I started thinking that I was not living well with my husband . He was a very angry man and very jealous . He drank . He hit me ; he did not let me leave the house . He was the one who decided about the house , even about my person . Even when I did n't feel like doing anything he demanded that I do things . My life was a sacrifice . <p> I thought , and I said to myself , " I am a woman , a suffering woman . " I asked my neighbors if they were in as much trouble as I was . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day I heard on the radio that women were organizing themselves through the Catholic church . Also the church was giving out beans , rice , and corn . So I went to the Catholic church to seek the council of the priest . The priest told me to find other women so we could organize ourselves . I invited the women to organize with me in housewives ' clubs . We went to the priest and he received us , he gave us talks . That is when I realized that I should n't be so enslaved . I was woman with my rights , my dignity , and I should be respected . That is when I began to work for the women 's movement , and also for men as well . <p> Like many other Hondurans , I have often gone to jail for the struggle . I have been a prisoner four times . For me to go to prison now is like going home ; I am used to the way they treat me . The last time they really messed me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They tortured me - they tied me at my hands and feet , they hung me , they hit me , and they filled the cell with water to my waist . They did n't give me anything to eat or drink . The cell was as dark as if it were at night during the daytime , and they tied many times to rape me . <p> I suffered a lot . I have scars where they tortured me , holes that they made with knives in my legs . They wanted to kill me . They accused me of being a terrorist and a communist . They said that I was subversive , that I was a guerilla , that I had campesinos armed in the mountains . They threatened that if I continued my struggle with the campesinos they were going to kill me . I experienced some horrible moments of desperation . But this did not lessen my morale . I felt more courage to continue the struggle . I said to myself : " This is the struggle , this is my social commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others I am going to give it . " I had this is my head and it helped me a lot . <p> I was at the point of dying . My daughters were looking for me in all the police posts , and they denied the fact that I was in jail . But in Honduras there are also people with good hearts . There are lawyers in Honduras who helped me to regain my freedom . Because it is not true what the government accused me of . To demand land , to say that we have no health care , we have no education , that does not mean you are a communist . That is to reclaim your rights as citizens . <p> The liberal party in Honduras recognized this right when it placed the first Agrarian Reform Law on the books in 1975 . This law allowed campesinos to take over land that was being used marginally . That law was nullified by the Agricultural Modernization Law of 1991 , which was passed by the current government . This law prohibits campesinos to occupy under-utilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is against the majority of the people of Honduras - we the rural peoples . This Agricultural Modernization Law more or less assassinated the Honduran peasant movement , because now we do n't have access to recover lands . We do n't have assistance or aid from the government in anyform . The campesinos are not professional . We ca n't ask for work from the government . So we need to reclaim the land in order to work . We , the illiterate campesinos , how are we going to live if the government has cut off all access to the land ? <p> There is no source of work in Honduras now , and people are despairing as they try to find work . That is why there is so much immigration toward the United States . People should not be heading to the United States . The Honduran should remain in his country to fight against the injustice that the government has done in taking away his land . We should all be fighting together against this black circle of poverty . <p> Before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the 1975 Agrarian Reform Law . That law was on the books , but it was not enforced , so we were able to pressure the government to enforce the law . If the government denied us the land then we , with all our bravery , with all our force , would simply go onto the land . The women that were organized in cooperatives , we just took the land along with the men , and we began to work the land and to plant corn . <p> Through the struggle , the lucha , we have acquired land , but it is the worst land in Honduras - land in the mountains , land not sufficient for producing . It is not that the government wants to give us this land . It has cost us life and life-blood , it has meant sacrifice and suffering . I still do n't have any land , but we have a bit of land that we managed to get working as a peasant group together - we work that land collectively . <p> The best land in Honduras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruit , U.S. Fruit , and the Rosario Mining company . Standard Fruit and U.S. Fruit grow bananas for export . Honduran cattle ranchers also own much of the best land . They grow grass on it to fatten cattle that they export to other countries . While these companies make millions of dollars in these businesses we grow poorer every day . There are also U.S. and Honduran lumbering companies that exploit the forest with the support of the government . This exploitation of the forest affects the environment ; it dries up the rivers and the streams . We who live in the countryside are without water to cultivate or drink . <p> When we recovered our land we did not do it just for the sake of doing it , we did it because the poverty , the crushing poverty , obligated us to take the lands . The majority of the population in Honduras are illiterate campesinos . We do n't have education , we do n't have anywhere to live , we do n't have health care , and we do n't have land to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land so we can work , so we can halfway live . There were many children who were malnourished . While the cattle were very fat the children were dying of malnutrition . The necessity of our lives made us take the land to work it . And we have the right to take our hand . Why should n't we ? If the North American companies are able to grab the land , why ca n't we , who are Hondurans , grab the land ? <p> In Honduras , women as well as men work the land that they recover . Women plant beans and yucca , and sow corn . When I worked with the Catholic church we were trained to give talks to other women , and we also carried out a lot of other activities . The church got hold of milk products for us and we learned how to make nutritious food for our kids . We also learned to plant greens in little gardens in the back patios of our houses to fight the malnutrition of our children . <p> It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initially , the women 's groups had a lot of support from the Catholic church . But when the people began to organize and ask for land , to demand land - since you know there is economic power in land - the government did n't like that any more . The government do as well . You ca n't work any more with the campesinos ; it is prohibited to give them support . " That is when we remained alone without any support . So we formed a federation of campesina women . <p> When I first began my work the men were completely negative . They did not want to organize . They said : " What the hell are we going to do in this kind of organization ? " They did not feel that it was important . Then the Law of Agraria Reform was passed , and we organized to get the land to work . <p> Our organization is a national organization that focuses on education . Education in different forms . Education to organize , to promote , to cultivate the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not like university classes . Our organization is political , but in a social sense , it does not have anything to do with the political parties in Honduras . There is no discrimination . Anyone who wants to join can join . There are whites , there are blacks , all colors . Catholics , protestants , everyone . We are all people of God . <p> We have about thirty percent of the campesinos organized at this time , but there are still more than half who are not organized . We know that it is a difficult struggle , but it is not impossible . Now the campesino who is organized is someone who is transformed . At least he knows what an organization is , he knows how we are going to continue our work . They say now that it was a great idea to organize . <p> With the new Clinton government we have more hope then ever in our work , because we feel Clinton is more open than past U.S. presidents . We hope that Clinton will have better policies , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We feel already that the killings and the persecution have gone down in our country , because the former U.S. governments were heavily involved with the goings-on in Honduras . They - Bush particularly - imposed policies that favored the rich and not the poor . <p> The North American troops in Honduras are still there , but they are not active now . I hope that Clinton removes the North American troops from Honduras because we have our own Honduran military to take care of our country . There is no reason for North American troops to be in Honduras . We are not fighting against anybody . We want peace , we want work , we want the things we need for all Hondurans - health , education , housing . We do not want war . Nor do we want another country from outside to provoke an internal war in Honduras - such as happened with Nicaragua . Nicaragua did not want war , but Reagan and Bush provoked war . And even if Nicaragua did have fights inside , better to leave them to find their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody should have been messing around with the internal war of Nicaragua . They have their own authority , their own government , their own military . It is the same in Salvador - there was also a war provoked there . <p> The people of Central America do not want war . Because it is us , the poor , who die in these wars . The rich provoke the war , and then they leave the front . They stay in other countries , and watch the war they provoked in their own country . Over there , they can watch and see what opportunities have been left by the war . <p> They say that there is communism . They say , " Look , there are guerrillas inside that country . " That is just a defaming campaign of the rich . That is just to stick in everyone 's head that there is communism . But that is not true , there is not communism . Is it communism to say that we are hungry , that someone does not have health , that we lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should give us jobs ? No , that is not communism . To say that someone does not have housing , those are rights that we have as people . To demand from my government that we are able to get the things we need to live , that is not communism . I do n't believe that communism exists . I believe that there are powerful interests - social , economic , and political - from the big countries . That is what those big countries do so that people inside the other countries feel fear . <p> The wars that the U.S. provokes are not the only problem . Another problem is the kinds of development programs that the U.S. sponsors in Honduras . U.S. AID , for instance , is the right arm of the U.S. government , and it is exploiting the country of Honduras . It has the fame of being U.S. AID , and it does projects and programs in Honduras , but they are just mirages . Even the Peace Corps does not work with us , the peasants in Honduras . It only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government . But with the campesinos , no . We have no support from the Peace Corps . <p> In order to make progress , then , we must strengthen our own organizations . Only as organized women can we reclaim our rights . The men as well need to be organized to reclaim their rights as citizens . Honduran women , however , have a special dynamism because they have to confront their abuses both as a people and as women . We Honduran woman do n't have fear that they are going to stick us in jail , that they are going to rape us - we are not afraid of that . We are brave . As women we have the courage to say what we as Hondurans need . <p> I ask the North American people that , just as with the Honduran people , you protest to your government the injustices that it commits . You as North Americans have the duty and the right to protest against your government because you put it into power . Here in the United States there are injustices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also I have seen churches in this country that have lines of people waiting for food and places to sleep , and the last time I was here I saw women with signs in the street asking for work . There is another thing that should not exist in this country - racism . We the Indians , with the whites and the blacks , we are the same people . Why should there be this difference ? We are all citizens , born with the right to live . We are all people of God . <p> So I invite North American women to not just lose yourself in work , but to think a minute about other people . I ask North American women to not just look to yourselves , but also to look outside of yourself toward the work that needs to be done and to think about what is it that others need as well . So all of us - Latin American women , Central American women , North American women - we are going to fight together to change the world , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ask this of North American women because you are powerful , you have power . Be not afraid women . <p> Many people contributed to the final form of this article .
