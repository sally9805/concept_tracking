Section : On Political Books As told to Woodward and Bernstein A Note From Charles Peters : <p> A few months ago , a reporter for Brill 's Content , in the midst of interviewing me about another matter , mentioned how delighted she had been by a recent Monthly piece by Art Levine . Unfortunately , the reporter did not express that admiration in her magazine . This has been Art 's fate . His fans have never gone public . The only exception is a 1983 article by Laurence Zuckerman in the Columbia Journalism Review , which , in a sidebar , completely reprinted Art 's brilliant and very funny sendup of the Monthly ( originally published in the magazine in 1979 ) . Otherwise Art is our most unfamous alumnus . He deserves better . If you doubt me , read the parody of The Final Days that follows . Its take on Bob Woodward , as you will see , has been adopted by many writers , all of whom neglected to acknowledge that Art was first to point out Woodward 's tendency  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on bigshot sources who are treated with kid gloves in return . The most obvious sources were Nixon 's White House counsel J. Fred Buzhardt and his chief of staff Alexander Haig . They were less than totally innocent Nixonians , but from The Final Days , you would have thought they deserved canonization . So enjoy and remember to mention Art . <p> FOLLOWING THE CRITICAL AND COMMERCIAL success of our book The Final Days , our publishers have prevailed on us to bring out a new edition of our early work on Adolf Hitler 's downfall , first published in 1947 . Here , in embryo form , are the journalistic techniques that were later brought to fruition in The Final Days . Our ability to penetrate the innermost workings of the Third Reich should provide valuable insights for those interested in our methodology . <p> In the course of reconstructing events , we interviewed 586 Nazis and checked every detail with at least two sources . We divided this massive undertaking into several areas of inquiry , including : Adolf Hitler ; the Reichschancellery staff ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutwaffe ; the Nazi Party ; Hitler 's personal physicians ; and the public record  --  statements by Nazi leaders , newspaper articles , memoirs , and official documents of the Third Reich . <p> From these and other areas of inquiry , we drew up a list of several hundred persons to be interviewed . Some spent many hours with us and volunteered information freely . Several of the principals met with each other to refresh their memories on these important events . Many supplied us with notes , memos , letters , and diaries , which were of immeasurable benefit . We made it clear that we would check all facts with other participants . <p> All interviewees were assured that their identities would remain forever secret . We vowed to go to our graves with the names of our sources locked within our hearts . Without this rigid security , we would never have been able to get an honest picture of the last days of the Third Reich . Traditional history , with its cumbersome reliance on footnotes and attributed statements , is too often marred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for posterity . We have avoided those pitfalls here . The results speak for themselves . <p> Bob Woodward <p> Carl Bernstein <p> This was an extraordinary mission . Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering and Heinrich Himmler , the Gestapo chief , settled in for the two-hour train trip to Berchtesgaden . The two sensitive and brilliant aides were leaving behind a hot , sunny Munich . It was Sept. 15 , 1943 . Ahead of them lay the mountains and lakes of western Germany and Austria . The sun poured in at a 47-degree angle through the windows . For most of the travelers , the trip was an occasion for relaxation , a brief respite from the war . Yet these two public servants were not in a holiday mood . <p> Goering and Himmler had heard rumors that the Fuhrer was anti-Semitic . It was all hearsay , innuendo , but still , the two men were troubled . <p> They had reached an inescapable conclusion : They must go to Berchtesgaden , confront the Fuhrer with these allegations , and ask him to put all doubts to rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amiable , flamboyant Goering mused about his own attitudes towards the Jewish people . He tapped his engraved swastika ring on the armrest as he recalled his lifelong admiration for the Jews . A plump , avuncular man with a fondness for expensive paintings , Goering had many Jewish friends from his days as a World War I air force hero . He kept up his contacts after he joined the National Socialist German Worker 's Party ( " Nazi 's " ) in the 1920 's . The Jews , Goering thought , were bright , hard-working , patriotic . <p> Goering was well-equipped to judge the finer qualities of man . As president of the Reichstag , then as air minister and founder of the Gestapo , Goering had impressed associates with his willingness to work long hours and his insider 's knowledge of the bureaucracy . He was tough , shrewd , and loyal . Goering was an aesthete and an elegant dresser . With his lacquered fingernails and green velvet capes , he cut an impressive figure at the Reichschancellery . <p> As the pastoral scene outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflective mood . " You know , Heinrich , " Goering said , twirling his 3-foot gold baton , " lately I sure miss having my close Jewish friends around to talk to . There used to be so many of them , and now I ca n't seem to get them on the phone any more . Where have they gone ? " <p> " Beats me , Hermann , " Himmler answered . He tugged absent-mindedly on his lapels with their provocative death's-head insignia . A fly hovered 2 inches above the window sill . Goering moved over to crush it , but Himmler reached out instinctively to grab his hand . " Do n't do that , Herman ! " Himmler exclaimed . " All life is sacred , down to the lowliest animal in God 's creation " The two men lapsed into silence for 72 seconds . Finally , Goering asked , " Have you heard anything about these so-called concentration camps ? " <p> Not really , Himmler said . Rumors here and there , but nothing solid , no firm evidence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goering said , that was a good idea . <p> The train pulled into the Berchtesgaden station at 5:22 p.m. , sending clouds of steam 18 feet into the air . The two men got off the train and looked for the chauffeured automobiles which would take them to the Berghof , the Fuhrer 's mountain retreat . They were nervous and tense as they contemplated their upcoming meeting with Adolf Hitler . <p> When they arrived at the chalet , the two men were led through a living room that was 60 feet long and 50 feet wide , with Italian paintings and Gobelin tapestries hanging on the walls . The soft-spoken Martin Bormann , often called the conscience of the Reichschancellery , greeted them in the anteroom outside Hitler 's office . He was reading a travel guide to Argentina when they came in . <p> " I 'm so glad you could come here , " Bormann said , adjusting his argyle socks . The Fuhrer , Bormann said , had been withdrawn and uncommunicative , making decisions in isolation . He had been in this mood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt he did n't really know the Fuhrer . His decisions were unpredictable : one day , silence , the next day , they invaded Russia . it was eerie . <p> Goering and Himmler were finally led into Hitler 's office . The Fuhrer was seated at his desk , drinking a Lowenbrau . He looked pale and exhausted . He had not been sleeping well . tie had been troubled by the defeat at Stalingrad , the Allied landing in Italy , the fall of Africa . Events were closing in on him . <p> The exchanged brief pleasantries . Churchill was an " asshole , " Mussolini " that fat wop . " Hitler rambled on about nothing , making little sense . <p> Then they got to the point . There had been some talk that the Fuhrer was anti-Semitic . They themselves did n't believe the charges , they made clear , but it was important for the sake of the country that Hitler lay the rumors to rest . The image of anti-Semitism was hampering foreign policy . Himmler and Goering finally wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipate future ones , answer them all . Had Hitler played any role in mistreating Jews ? <p> Absolutely not , Hitler said . <p> " Excuse me for a moment , " the Fuhrer said , picking up a bright red phone on his desk . " Hello , Ilse ? Bormann tells me what a good job you 've been doing . The way you 've handled it has been very skillful . " <p> Hitler turned back to face his confused assistants . " You know , " he remarked , " Hess just did n't have his head screwed on right " <p> " The Jews , Mein Fuhrer , what 's happened to all the Jews ? " Goering asked . " There used to be so many of them . " <p> " I 'm dying to find out , " Hitler said , winking broadly . " Get it ? " He collapsed with laughter , then composed himself . <p> Himmler was skeptical , but he did n't press the point with Hitler . The Fuhrer glanced at a picture of his dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Poles , too , " he added . He paused for a long moment . " But it would be wrong " Himmler and Goering were beset with fresh doubts . But they were committed to serve , and they would do their best . The biggest problem here , Goering thought , is credibility . The Fuhrer 's team could pull through , but it would not lie easy . <p> Himmler was disturbed . The Fuhrer was not being very cooperative in dispelling any lingering doubts . Finally , he asked point blank : " Mein Fuhrer , what are your true feelings about the Jewish people ? " <p> Hitler exploded . " I do n't give a shit how you do it , just get rid of them . That 's the plan . " The two men greeted these remarks with a disappointed silence . There was not much room for maneuvering here . It could be a problem . They kept their concerns to themselves , however . They did not wish to add to the Fuhrer 's burdens . Standing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh insights into your views on the Jewish people " The three men shook hands , and Himmler and Goering simultaneously realized how little they really knew the Fuhrer , even after all these years . <p> Privately , the two men were troubled by the meeting . They walked quickly down the hall and strode 29 yards into an empty office . They sat across from each other in two leather chairs , and sorted out their feelings . The two Nazi leaders realized that the Fuhrer was probably thinking out loud  --  trying out outrageous alternatives as a way of reaching decisions . It was part of the process . They had heard him do it before . <p> Himmler noted that all people , even dictators , said things they do n't mean . " Which one of us is without sin ? " Himmler asked . Goering nodded solemnly . Furthermore , Himmler added , the Fuhrer 's approach to the Jewish question had to be understood in the context of Hitler 's global plans for the security of the Third Reich . Nothing was black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . They would stand by the Fuhrer . <p> Drawing on their reserves of inner strength , they summoned up the courage to walk out of the office with big smiles on their faces . The foreign press still had questions , they learned . Goebbels would relay their answers . Was the Fuhrer an anti-Semite ? No , Himmler said , Hitler was not an anti-Semite . " The problem is behind us , " Goering added . " We 're definitely out of the woods . " <p> The Russian troops had reached the outskirts of Berlin . It was April 21 , 1945 . The skies were overcast . Goering and Himmler met secretly in the fashionable conference room of the Reichschancellery bunker . They had just learned of a signed memo linking Hitler to concentration camps . " We 've found the smoking Luger , " Himmler told Goering , his voice calm and emotionless . " It 's the ball game " No anti-Semite should continue to lead the German people , they agreed . <p> Himmler and Goering were shocked by the new evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never once imagining that he was capable of such depravity . They had pledged their lives to him , and he had betrayed them . More in sorrow than in anger , they decided that Himmler should arrange to meet the Fuhrer one last time . <p> Hitler seemed preoccupied . He was sitting on a brown leather couch in a small 12-by-9-foot room with a gun pointed at his head . Now and then there were the occasional dulled reverberations of artillery shells overhead . <p> Himmler looked at the pathetic figure before him with a mixture of loathing and contempt . He had always despised anti-Semites , and although he had never personally met any , he had heard that they were without a smattering of human decency . It was , he realized now , all too true . <p> Yet now Hitler acted as if he were reaching out to Himmler for forgiveness , some sign of absolution . Himmler was reminded once again of the enormous distance between them . " I 'm sorry I did n't tell you about the concentration camps , Heinrich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know that you are completely innocent , and I only hope that you have an opportunity to vindicate yourself in a court of law or , failing that , in any contemporary histories produced by journalists after my downfall " He lowered his eyes . " Will you ever forgive me ? " he pleaded . <p> " I accept your apologies , Mein Fuhrer , " Himmler responded . He thought to himself that the world will never know the full truth . " Himmler the monster , " the Allies would probably call him . It was a shame , but he would bear up under the burden . He had wanted a Third Reich devoted to civil liberties and racial equality , but his efforts apparently had no impact on Hitler 's policies . Now he would be called a war criminal by closed-minded critics . He sighed with stoic resignation . <p> Suddenly , Himmler flashed with anger . " How could you lie to us all these years ? You know how strongly I feel about religious freedom and the sacredness of human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do if I were to trick good people like yourself into devoting themselves to the national interest , " Hitler said , glancing at his Timex . " If you knew my real thoughts about the Jewish people , I 'm sure you would have left the country in the 1930 's " " You 're damn right , Hitler , " he shot back . " And I would have joined the Allies and brought you to justice , too . " <p> Himmler got up to leave . " I 'm going to convert to Judaism the first chance I get , as a small symbol of atonement for your immoral atrocities , which you implemented without my knowledge " Then he walked out , never once looking back at his nation 's leader . <p> The end was near , he realized , and as he strolled along the corridors he pondered his own role . He was , perhaps , not without guilt . He had made prolonged concealment possible . He had unwittingly helped keep things going . Of course , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't known what was going on . But there had been hints and signs everywhere , all along the way . He should have known , goddammit . He hit his fists together in exasperation . <p> Still , he had n't known of any specific piece of evidence . Until they had uncovered the death-camp memo . There it was , in black and white . Proof . The gossips in the Reichschancellery had been asking the same question for over two years : What did the Fuhrer know and when did he know it ? <p> Now Himmler knew . Somehow , it did n't make him feel much better . He went to his office to write a letter of resignation on a yellow legal pad . <p> By Art Levine <p>
