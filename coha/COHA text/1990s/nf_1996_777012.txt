Just In Time // Submitted by Dan Clark // One night at 11:30 , an older African-American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm . Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride . Soaking wet , she decided to flag down the next car . A young white man stopped to help her  --  generally unheard of in the deep South during those conflict-filled 1960s . The man took her to safety , helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab . She seemed to be a big hurry ! She wrote down his address , thanked him and rode away . // Seven days went by and a knock came on the man 's door . to his surprise , a giant combination console color TV and stereo record player were delivered to his home . // A special note was attached . The note read : // Dear Mr. James : // Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night . The rain drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came along . Because of you , I was able to make it to my dying husband 's bedside just before he passed away . God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others . // Sincerely , // Mrs. Nat King Cole // 1996 Dan Clark . All rights reserved .
