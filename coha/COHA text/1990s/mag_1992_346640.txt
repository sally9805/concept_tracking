There are n't many absolute rulers around these days , on thrones or in executive suites , but S.I . ( " Si " ) Newhouse Jr . comes close . Newhouse , 64 , who controls the magazines-and-books principality of his family 's $11 billion media empire , is accountable to no stockholders , keeps his own counsel and makes his own moves . When he is unhappy with the way things are going at one of his holdings , he is noted for acting stealthily , swiftly and at times brutally to make changes  --  as editors at Vogue and Self magazines , among others , have learned to their sorrow . <P> What Newhouse has been unhappy about lately is the New Yorker magazine , which he bought for $168 million in 1985 . In 1987 he touched off a staff insurrection when he ousted William Shawn , the 79-year-old icon who had ruled the legendary magazine for 35 years , to bring in his own editor , Robert Gottlieb , former president of Knopf publishers ( another Newhouse enterprise ) . But the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost at least $10 million last year , a significant sum even to Newhouse . Circulation , which had been boosted to 632,000 at considerable cost , is slipping . Advertising tumbled 18.5% in 1991 , although it is improving slightly now . More fundamentally , the New Yorker has not shaken off its aura of an elegant but musty institution , disdainful of topicality , given to sometimes self- indulgently long and arcane articles . <P> And so , Newhouse moved again , in an editorial blitz that caused a sensation in the media world when it was revealed last week . He forced Gottlieb , 61 , to resign in order to make way for the most unlikely editor the New Yorker has ever had : Tina Brown , 38 , who arrived in the U.S. from her native Britain in 1984 and promptly transformed Newhouse 's Vanity Fair from a faltering revival into the " hot book " of the magazine trade . <P> Creating a shrewd editorial mix of celebrity profiles , newsy features and provocative photos ( most notoriously , last year 's cover photo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Vanity Fair high profits and nearly 1 million readers . At the same time , she made herself a figure to reckon with on the Manhattan scene : good-looking , Oxford-educated , a sometime playwright , married to Harold Evans , former editor of the Times of London and now head of Random House ( yes , another Newhouse jewel ) . <P> Newhouse arranged Gottlieb 's departure more gracefully than he had past firings : he gave Gottlieb a rich settlement and allowed him to step down under cover of a plausible ( and largely true ) statement citing " conceptual differences that ( ( Si and I ) ) have been unable to resolve . " But there was no mistaking the boldness of Newhouse 's double gamble . Besides matching Brown with the New Yorker , he entrusted Vanity Fair to Graydon Carter , 42 , former editor of the weekly New York Observer and a founding editor of Spy magazine , who professed himself to be " modestly confident and modestly terrified . " <P> There was also no mistaking the feverish , often mordant speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker . When Brown announced her departure to a devoted Vanity Fair staff , she dissolved in tears ; but as she prepared to travel the three blocks to the New Yorker offices to meet her new editing cadre , she fretted privately , " They 're going to hate me . " She did what she could to reassure them , pledging that " the New Yorker will not be Vanity Fair . "
