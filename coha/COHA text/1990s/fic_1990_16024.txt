EXT . DESERT VALLEY - DAY The high desert  --  absolutely silent  --  a vast , hard landscape stretching away to distant mountains . The silence is broken by hoof-beats . PAN TO ESTABLISH : EXT . EDGAR 'S PLACE - DAY It 's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big , ramshackle barn . EDGAR DEEMS ( 60s ) , a weathered desert rat of a hermit , is walking his donkey around in circles . Now , rattling toward them down an endless dirt road , comes an old , sun-bleached Buick towing a trailer full of sheep . The car stops and out leans OLD FRED ( 70s ) wearing a sweatstained fedora . The two friends nod . &nbsp; OLD FREDHow 's she doing ? &nbsp; EDGARShe wants to lay down . I 'm a little worried . Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots . &nbsp; OLD FREDWell , I brung her something I know she likes . &nbsp; EDGARDamn , Fred , you ca n't give away all those . &nbsp; OLD FREDForget it . I got vegetables coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low on . &nbsp; EDGARGod damn coyotes . . . &nbsp; OLD FREDYou 'd think so . . . but there 's no sign of them either . &nbsp; EDGARMaybe just one big , fat , happy one .  --  3  --  The men chuckle at that .

Look what Fred brought you . &nbsp; OLD FREDWe playing cards tonight ? &nbsp; EDGARI think I 'm gon na be sitting up with her . &nbsp; OLD FREDI 'd do the same . Well , catch you Thursday . &nbsp; EDGAR ( mimes taking a drink of whisky ) You bet . I 'll bring the ammunition . The men smile , and Old Fred drives off . &nbsp; EDGAR ( to Donkey ) Let 's get you out of the sun for a spell . You been eating too much of that rabbit brush . Go on , admit it . . . CLOSE-UP of the donkey 's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads her to the barn . He ushers her inside , shuts the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : &nbsp; EDGARI 'll get you some fresh water . But , suddenly , we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying . Edgar turns , concerned . Now we hear an odd sound . Distant thunder ? The wind ? The donkey gets more and more frantic . The barn shudders violently . Frightened birds explode from the eaves . Dust puffs from every old seam . Edgar stares in amazement . Then another sound  --  the donkey starts screeching in wild panic . Edgar races back to the barn , flinging open the doors .  --  4  --  INT . EDGAR 'S BARN - DAY Dust swirls through the air . Hanging tools sway eerily . But  --  the barn is empty . No donkey  --  no other possible exit . Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench . He staggers back and covers his nose with a handkerchief . &nbsp; EDGARHoly Moses . . . ! He raises his arms above the door frame . When he lowers them he 's holding an old Winchester rifle . He races outside , looking everywhere , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Section Details EXT . CLIFFS - DAWN The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000 feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau . At the top of the cliffs , silhouetted against the dawn , a lone cow- boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise . As we MOVE IN , we realize he 's actually peeing over the cliff . This is VALENTINE McKEE ( 25 ) . Smart and good looking , Val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly . He coasts through life , following the path of least resistance  --  which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization . But lately he 's beginning to wonder why he has n't accomplished more in his 25 years . As a few sleepy cows gaze at him , sleepy , bare-chested Val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck . A hand-painted sign on the door reads : " V &amp; E  --  All Type 's of Job 's . " Indeed , the pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag . Val raps on the side of the truck . &nbsp; VAL ( softly ) Good morning , Mr. Bassett , this is your wake-up call . Please move that fat ass of yours . No response from the sleeping bag . Val stares at the cows chewing their cud  --  and perks up as he gets an idea . He gently steps onto the truck 's bumper , then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can , rocking the truck violently .  --  5  --  &nbsp; VALSTAMPEDE ! EARL , GET OUT OF THE WAY ! The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it , tumbling out of the pickup . While Val laughs uproariously , EARL BASSET ( 43 ) claws his way out of the bag , looks around wildly , and finds himself staring at three motionless cows . &nbsp; EARLYou dumb shit . Earl is a good-ol ' boy who has lived his life just like Val , drifting from job to job . He knows why he has n't accomplished much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the last thing the younger man wants is advice . &nbsp; EARLYou know , I was in a stampede once . . . &nbsp; VAL/EARL ( in unison ) . . . three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon . . . Earl stops . Val grins  --  he 's heard the story a dozen times . &nbsp; VALHow many cows are required for a stampede , Earl ? Is it like three or more ? Is there a minimum speed ? &nbsp; EARLI wish a stampede on your ass . The men begin a silent ritual : Earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette , but only finds his old Zippo lighter . Meanwhile , Val digs in his pockets , coming up with cigarettes , but no lighter . Typical of these two , each guy always has half of what he needs . Eventually they sort it out , trading the necessary implements . Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on the tailgate . But it 's cold . &nbsp; EARLNo breakfast ? &nbsp; VALI did it yesterday . Franks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall ) No. . . it was eggs . I did eggs . &nbsp; VALHell you did . It 's your turn . Earl raises his fist . This is The Challenge , and it instantly triggers the partners ' conflict-resolution technique . They solve all disputes using the children 's game of " scissors , rock , paper . " Earl raises his fist in response . The game is played swiftly and silently  --  one , two , three . On three , Val mimes " paper " ( open hand ) . Earl mimes " scissors " ( two extended fingers ) . Scissors cuts paper . Val has lost . He shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank . &nbsp; VALWell , when I 'm your age I 'll probably forget what I eat , too . EXT . DESERT - FENCE - DAY Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated , and seemingly endless , barbed wire fence . A few bored cows watch them . Earl 's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his thick glove . &nbsp; EARLOw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? ! &nbsp; VALShow me one . I 'll ask him . &nbsp; EARLI keep thinking , if we were but half serious about money , we should quit being hired hands and . . . &nbsp; VAL ( mock serious ) Handymen , Earl . We 're handymen . &nbsp; EARLYeah , yeah , we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment . Val gestures to the vastness around them . &nbsp; VALAnd give up all this personal freedom ? I do n't know . . .  --  7  --  Section Details INT/EXT . TRUCK - JEEP TRAIL - DAY Val struggles to maneuver the truck down a tortuous , rocky , almost impassable trail . It takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel , shifts , rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route . Earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast , a raw hot dog right out of the package . &nbsp; VALGoddamn jeep trail gets worse every year . &nbsp; EARL ( shrugs ) Had a lot of rain . Earl pulls a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one bar left . Val glances at it  --  and raises his fist : The Challenge . One , two , three . Earl loses . He frowns and sticks the half-opened bar in Val 's grinning mouth . Then : &nbsp; EARL ( pointing ahead ) You 're gon na get us hung up . &nbsp; VALDo not talk to the driver . THWONK ! The truck lurches to a stop , its frame caught on a big rock . Val glares at Earl . EXT . DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY The pick-up turns from the rocky jeep-trail onto a graded dirt road . &nbsp; VAL ( V.O. ) Ah , freeway . What are we doing today ? INT . PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat . &nbsp; EARLIt 's garbage day .  --  8  --  &nbsp; VAL ( grimaces ) Oh , man . Already ?

Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; EARLNestor 's out of town tomorrow . We do n't dig today . We do n't get paid today . Damn it , Valentine , you never plan ahead . You never take the long view . Hell , here it is Monday and I 'm already working on Wednesday . ( squints dubiously at his schedule ) It is Monday , right ? But Val is peering at the desert up ahead . Off the road a ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and , beside it , a lone figure waving to flag them down . &nbsp; VALWho the hell 's that ? That 's not what 's his name . . . the grad student ? &nbsp; EARLNah , he graduated . Must be the new one . &nbsp; VALThe new one ! That 's supposed to be a girl . Earl braces himself , knowing what Val will do . Val swerves the truck wildly off the road , barreling across the desert . &nbsp; VAL ( almost praying ) You will have long blonde hair , big green eyes , nice full breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quit . And legs , legs that go all the way up ! Earl shakes his head , mildly bemused as they slide to a stop in a cloud of dust .  --  9  --  EXT . DESERT - RHONDA 'S TRUCK - DAY Val looks out hopefully . The dust clears . He sees her  --  RHONDA LeBECK , ( 25 ) . Val 's eyes do an expert vertical scan : She 's not his type . Screwdriver in one hand , disassembled seismograph in the other , she stares at him through tilted glasses , her nose smeared with white zinc oxide to protect from sunburn . Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology field equipment . She shakes Val 's hand firmly . &nbsp; RHONDA ( brightly ) Hi , I 'm Rhonda . Rhonda LeBeck . I 'm up here for the semester . . . &nbsp; EARLYeah , geography . &nbsp; VALGeology . &nbsp; RHONDAYeah , actually seismology. . . earthquakes . And you have to be Val and Earl , right ? I 've heard a lot about you . &nbsp; EARLWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question for you . Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that ? &nbsp; VALAround here ? Why would they ? &nbsp; RHONDAWell , I 'm supposed to monitor these seismographs . You know , they measure vibrations . . . &nbsp; VALYeah , vibrations in the ground .  --  10  --  &nbsp; RHONDAYeah , well , I 've been getting some really strange readings . I mean , the school has had these machines up here three years and they 've never recorded any reading like this . &nbsp; EARLWell , we 'll ask around . Let you know if we hear of anything . &nbsp; RHONDAThanks . God , I hope they 're not screwed up . I might have to bag the whole semester . Anyway , sorry to bother you . &nbsp; EARLNo problem . Nice meeting you . Hope you get it sorted out . Val tips his hat to her . Rhonda watches as they drive off , mildly amused by these two local boys . She turns back to her truck . Catching her reflection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got a white nose . INT . PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye . &nbsp; EARLYou know , if you wanted , we could take a look at those seismographs for her . &nbsp; VALWhat the hell do we know about seismographs ? &nbsp; EARLNothing . But it sure might be a slick way of getting to know her . &nbsp; VALWhy ? &nbsp; EARLGoddamnit , Valentine , you wo n't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours top to bottom . . . &nbsp; VALWell , sure .  --  11  --  &nbsp; EARL . . . And is dumber than my hind end . Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter . . . Val flips down the truck 's sunvisor . Taped to it are snapshots of nearly identical blonde bimbos .

" Make my skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance . &nbsp; EARLI thought you called it your pecker . Look , do n't make the mistake I made . Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968 , and where 'd it get me ? Here with you . Val rolls his eyes  --  " Give me a break . " Section Details EXT . PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY The pick-up rattles toward a tiny , utterly isolated high desert hamlet  --  a few houses and mobile homes fighting for shade in the vast landscape . Its most prominent feature is an aging wood-frame water tower , near the center of town . As they turn off the dirt road onto a paved road , a sign PANS into view  --  " PERFECTION  --  Pop . 14 . " EXT . CHANG 'S STORE - DAY Val and Earl head past the water tower for Walter 's General Store , Perfection 's main gossip stop and only business . The store 's sign , in English and Chinese reads : " Groceries , Haircuts , Post Office , Town Hall , VIDEOS ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blazer . Just then they spot MELVIN , the town 's surly teen-aged pain-in-the-ass , mindlessly bouncing a basketball off of parked cars . As he nears their truck : &nbsp; EARLMelvin , touch that truck and die .  --  12  --  &nbsp; MELVINOh , man , I 'm really shaking . But he steers clear of their truck . INT . CHANG 'S STORE - DAY Inside , the energetic Chinese owner , WALTER CHANG , presides over his all-purpose establishment : part general store , part barber shop , part saloon . A TV behind the counter plays a documentary on the food chain , or a pest control commercial on garden slugs . At the bar are BURT and HEATHER GUMMER . A pair of no-nonsense survivalists , they are nevertheless a nice enough couple who 've settled in Perfection to await the coming apocalypse . Burt shoves a box of cartridges across to Walter . &nbsp; BURTYeah , Walter , they 're hollow points , but they 're not Hydra-Shok hollow points . That 's what I ordered and that 's what I want . &nbsp; WALTERExcuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the box .

The way you worry , you 're gon na have a heart attack before you get to survive World War Three . Heather and Walter laugh . Burt smiles patiently . Just then the compressor in Pham 's ice cream freezer comes on . It 's a loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal . &nbsp; WALTERHey guys , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He starts toward the freezer , but Earl heads him off . &nbsp; EARLCatch it later , Walter . Got ta schedule to keep . &nbsp; VALRight . We plan ahead . That way we do n't do anything right now . Earl explained it to me . As they turn to go , Val does a take , amazed , as he spots a decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter  --  with a $29.95 price tag . &nbsp; VALHey , Walter , what the hell is this ? &nbsp; BURTA beauty , is n't it ? We bought three of them for the rec room . &nbsp; VAL ( whispers to Walter ) We sell ' em to you for three bucks a piece ! &nbsp; WALTER ( deadpan ) And I appreciate it . &nbsp; VAL ( playfully ) You do n't get it , Walter .

Mired in dried mud and weeds , tires flat , it now provides welcome shade as the men plop down on an old abandoned sofa to sip water from a gallon plastic bottle . NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up in his old Cadillac , surveying the job with approval . &nbsp; NESTORLooks good , fellas . You do a professional job . Lemme have that bill .

Terrified Val and Earl scramble away . But the wall holds together . And then , strangely , all is quiet . The tentacle lays dead still . Eventually , the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer , still panting , exhausted , jumpy . &nbsp; EARLStupid son of a bitch . . . knocked itself cold .

Val , digging excitedly with Rhonda 's shovel , is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature 's tail . The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered , in king-sized bas-relief . &nbsp; EARL ( hushed ) This is one big mother ! &nbsp; VALSo this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime ? She nods , stepping down to study the creature . The body is stream-lined , cigar-shaped , about five feet in diameter at its thickest . It 's covered with dozens of short , rear-pointing , retractable spikes . Rhonda gingerly jiggles one . It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger . The neighboring spikes ripple in unison like a wave moving across the creature . &nbsp; RHONDAIt must push itself along with these . All of them pushing at once . That 's how it can move so fast . I mean this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder I could n't . . . A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence . She springs down into the ditch to get her backpack , pulling out her seismograph printouts .

Val and Earl shut right up . Earl edges up a fencepost . Val sidles up onto a rock during : &nbsp; EARLThree more ? Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts , pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs , comparing different ones . &nbsp; RHONDAYeah , man , look . I 've got seismographs all over the valley . If you compare the different readings , there have to be three of them left . Here 's one at two o'clock yesterday , but here 's another one three miles away at the same time . So that 's two .

Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground . Almost instantly the creature roars up , grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles , nearly hooking Val 's hand . Val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety . &nbsp; VALSon of a bitch ! &nbsp; EARLSon of a goddamned bitch ! Been waiting there all this time . How the hell 's it even know we 're still here ? &nbsp; VALIt 's been listening to us . It 's got no eyes , right ? And it sure as hell ca n't smell anything underground .

But in mere seconds : &nbsp; RHONDA ( pointing ) LOOK OUT !  --  64  --  Behind Val the creature is advancing again , Val scrambles around , grabs Rhonda under the arms and pulls . She wriggles wildly to get out of her wire enmeshed pants . Tentacles snake out ! Rhonda pulls free ! She and Val tumble backward .

He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at Earl who shrugs like , " Hey , what 'd I do ? " Val looks back at Rhonda to find her staring at him . They both look away , embarrassed . Val nods to Walter who is holding up a new pair of jeans for Rhonda.  --  65  --  Walter starts to toss the jeans , then catches himself .

Its tentacles snake out and slither around Walter 's body , horrid hooks shredding his clothes , anchoring themselves in his flesh , holding him fast . One tentacle is the bloodied stump we 've seen before . The creature starts to back down into the jagged hole , dragging screaming Walter with it . Val , Earl , Rhonda , and Miguel dive over to grab Walter 's arms , but are no match for the monster . It shakes and spins Walter like some gigantic dog , effortlessly throwing them off .

Val stares at him , incredulous . &nbsp; VALHow the hell long it take you to change a tire ? &nbsp; EARL ( sighs ) Just about too damn long . Bolt pattern 's probably wrong anyway . &nbsp; VALWe need another plan . Suddenly , down in the store , Walter 's CB radio squawks loudly . &nbsp; BURT ( V. O. ) Yo , Walter , Burt here . Come back . The building shudders as the creatures again smash through the floor inside , looking for the source of the noise . Val , Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof . INT .

INT . BURT &amp; HEATHER 'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den , Burt 's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-Apocalypse living .

She switches on the case cleaner . It HUMS loudly as it vibrates . She steps over to join Burt at the CB . INT . CHANG 'S STORE - DAY The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor . TILT UP to see out the window some distance away , a couple of old oil drums on their sides rock gently as the creature streaks past beneath them , making a bee-line for Burt 's . EXT . CHANG 'S STORE - ROOF - DAY Miguel points frantically at the trash cans . &nbsp; MIGUELOh man , they 're going , man ! I think they 're going for Burt !  --  71  --  Val talks a little louder into the mic . &nbsp; VALBurt ! Get out of your basement ! ! Take your radio ! You and Heather get up on your roof !

Jesus Christ ! Get out of your basement ! The things ! They 're under the ground ! They 're huge . Much bigger than we thought ! They 're coming after you guys They 're coming right now ! Hearing that warning , Burt and Heather go into a well-honed drill . They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at basement windows . Burt scans with the binoculars . He sees nothing . He glances at Heather . She shrugs . Nobody coming . &nbsp; BURT ( into CB ) We do n't see anything , Val . Now what the hell are you talking about ? Over . Val is frantic . How do you explain these things ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They . . . they can dig like a son of a bitch . . . Big monsters under the ground , Burt ! Now get the hell out ! Hurry ! Burt and Heather exchange looks . Has Val gone nuts ? Then they hear a low RUMBLE , growing louder and louder .  --  72  --  Tools on a peg-board rack hanging over the work bench start to shake ; the decorative cow skulls on the wall rattle ; the overhead lights sway  --  and then  --  everything stops . Dead silence , except for the humming of the case cleaner . THEN THE WALL MOVES , bulging in slightly ! The tool-rack pops loose and clatters to the floor . The wall is pushed again ; the cinder blocks crack . The cow skulls fall . Burt and Heather level their rifles and  --  A huge creature pushes right through the wall ! Fully half its bulbous , spiked body writhes into the center of the room , great multi-part jaws drooling open , tentacles lashing out . EXT .

The men perk up ; they know what it is  --  distant gunfire . INT . BURT &amp; HEATHER 'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away . Some shots ricochet off the creature 's bony beak , but others do damage , gloppy blood spurting from a half dozen wounds . The creature pulls back a little . The couple keeps firing until magazines are empty . The creature lunges forward again . Muddy , gravelly drool foams out of its mouth . PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we have n't seen until now  --  a wall covered with guns  --  hand guns , long guns , riot guns , flare guns , antique guns , military guns , elephant guns . Burt grabs an HK-91 assault rifle , slams in two magazines , bottoms taped end to end , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off his feet . Heather pumps out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun , severing the tentacle . Burt is on his feet in an instant . He expertly flops his double magazine over , loading the full one taped upside-down to it , and opens fire again . Heather grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins him . They lay down massive fire , virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and smoke . Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the room . The guns are empty . THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING ! They back down the wall , desperately grabbing weapons one after another : a lever-action , a magnum handgun , even a flare gun  --  73  --  which Heather fires right into the creature 's mouth . Shrieking in pain , the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING TOWARD THEM ! Burt and Heather are now cornered . Burt smashes open a fancy glass case holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun . He slams in two gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter . He fires . The concussion literally shakes the building . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets tear monster holes in the monster . Great gouts of curdled blood spew from it  --  Burt hit an artery or something . The beast convulses grotesquely , then collapses , deflating like a beached whale , GASPING noisily for a while before it finally dies . Burt and Heather stagger together and hug each other fervently . They stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror . Burt suddenly shouts vehemently : &nbsp; BURTBroke into the wrong goddamn rec room , did n't you , you BASTARD ! Section Details EXT . CHANG 'S STORE - ROOF - DAY Val , Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some sign that their friends are alive . Suddenly : &nbsp; BURT ( V.O. filter ) We killed it ! You got that ?

EXT . BURT &amp; HEATHER 'S HOUSE - ROOF - DAY Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof . Burt spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house . &nbsp; BURT ( into CB ) One second , Val .  --  75  --  He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots  --  two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains . But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt . The bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view . Heather shakes her head . &nbsp; HEATHERYou 're not getting the penetration , even with the elephant gun . &nbsp; BURTDamn ! ( into CB ) Val , we ca n't get them . Never figured on having to shoot through dirt ! Best goddamn bullet stop there is . Come back . EXT . CHANG 'S STORE - ROOF - DAY The men are disappointed .

Tell me this : can you get to your truck ? &nbsp; BURT ( V.O. ) No problem . &nbsp; EARLGood . You 've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail . So , here 's the plan : You and Heather go for help . Get to the mountains . . . But Rhonda interrupts , pointing urgently from the water tower . &nbsp; RHONDAHey , guys ! Look ! One of them 's back . He 's up to something . Val , Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look down where she 's pointing  --  A creature is running its tentacles along the building 's foundation . It 's a strange , more studied movement than we 've seen before . We recognize this one , too . Its the one with the oozing severed stump of a tentacle.  --  76  --  &nbsp; VALHey , look , it 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; VAL ( to Rhonda ) What 's it doing ? &nbsp; RHONDAWhy do you all keep asking me ? They all stare nervously down as the creature feels its way along the wall , until it reaches a corner . Then it submerges , tentacles zipping into the earth . Nothing happens for a moment . Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple of feet ! Clapboard siding splits . A warped window shatters . ( We do n't see the creatures , only the effect of their shoving from below ) . The men nearly lose their balance . Then the corner sinks back down . &nbsp; EARLWhat the hell was that all about ? &nbsp; BURT ( V.O. ) Breaker there , Earl . What do you want us to do ? Come back ? &nbsp; EARL ( into CB ) Hang on , Burt . This bastard is trying something new . EXT . NANCY 'S HOUSE - DAY Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof . They do n't make a sound . They 're startled when the house suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth roof . A window shatters . We hear beams POP and CRACK , dishes CRASH off shelves . The front screen door swings open . Up on the roof , Mindy slips .

Rhonda chimes in from the water tower . &nbsp; RHONDAYeah , they 're confused . They can feel our vibrations , but they ca n't find us . &nbsp; EARL ( worried ) Maybe . . . But it looks to me like they 're coming up with a plan . . . EXT . NESTOR 'S TRAILER - ROOF - DAY Now the creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic as the creature lifts the trailer up slowly . A few of the old tires on the roof start to slide off , thudding to the ground one after another and  --  WHAM ! The trailer suddenly bucks upward , hit from below as though by a pile driver ! Again and again the unseen creature slams into the frail structure . We hear it underneath , snorting and huffing . The trailer is knocked right off its foundation ! It slides crazily this way and that , getting more and more battered . Finally it tips over ! Nestor sails off the roof , landing heavily near an big earth mover 's tire , three feet thick . It 's his only hope . He scrambles up onto it , like a man onto a life raft , lying there for a moment , panting . The next instant he 's grabbed ! GONE ! Yanked right through the center of the tire ! We hear his SCREAM as we DOLLY along the ground , heading toward the storage shed where Melvin is . All we can see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNDERGROUND !

One corner lifts up , beams splintering . The roof tilts like the deck of a storm-tossed ship . The front porch collapses . From now on the monster shakes and rams the building almost constantly . Hanging on tight , the men peer over the edge . &nbsp; EARLWe do n't have a hell of a lot of time here . Meanwhile , Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical : &nbsp; RHONDALook , the situation has n't changed . We still have to get to solid rock .

We need a decoy . &nbsp; EARLHey , Melvin , you wan na make a buck ? &nbsp; MELVINFuck you ! Miguel grabs Earl and points down at a little garden tractor in a jumble of Walter 's equipment and tools near the side of the store . &nbsp; MIGUELHey , how about the tractor , Walter 's little tractor ? Start him up . Let him go by itself . Let those things chase it all over if they like that noise . &nbsp; EARL ( nodding ) Not bad . ( to Val ) What do you think ? The store takes a heavy hit .

The semi trailer shakes and shudders , slowly sinking . The people huddle together in sheer panic . Val and Earl grab the nearest of Burt and Heather 's guns and fire wildly , hopelessly , down at the dirt . Ricochets whine into the distance . Burt grimly digs in an overloaded knapsack for one of his pipe bombs . He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the fuse , looking for a target . &nbsp; BURTHungry ? ! Eat this ! ! He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into the semi trailer . &nbsp; BURTKeep your heads down ! KABOOM ! The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain from the creatures . The semi trailer instantly stops shaking . The creatures have stopped digging . All is quiet .

As Burt readies another bomb , he pauses to hand bug-eyed Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun . &nbsp; BURTHere , kid . This 'll make'em think twice . Melvin 's eyes bug out further . Burt lights his bomb . &nbsp; BURTHeads down ! ! He hurls the bomb . Wait . Wait . WHOOOM ! Again we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her feet before the rocks stop falling .

CRANE UP with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like soldiers out of a trench  --  they charge across no-man's-land . Melvin runs like a demon . He tries to shoot at the first thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over  --  empty . &nbsp; MELVINBurt , you bastard ! ! Enraged , he doubles his speed , trying to overtake Burt . Mindy ca n't keep up . Nancy tries to pull her along .

The effect is instantly sobering . Burt swiftly grabs one of his remaining bombs and holds it ready . But they 're in no immediate danger . &nbsp; EARLSo. . . now what ? &nbsp; RHONDACould we make it to the mountains ? &nbsp; VAL ( gestures to Burt 's bombs ) No way . We 'd need fifty of those things . The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val , Earl , and Rhonda . After a moment : &nbsp; EARLWell. . . that 's it .
