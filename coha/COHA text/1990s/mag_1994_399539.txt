First he got involved with a neighbor in his new apartment complex only to learn she was already attached : Her husband suddenly appeared . Next he reconnoitered a nearby beach touted by a colleague as the place he 'd met his wife only to find " 200 guys in black Speedos " : It had become a gay hangout . Then he showed up for lunch with a dating-service-matched bookstore clerk only to find himself breaking bread with a militant vegetarian inclined to Scientology : " She was out there , " he says . Why is a nice guy like Tim Carlsen , who moved from San Francisco to Seattle last summer to take an investment banking job , putting himself through all this ? Simply because this hard-charging , 33-year-old Dubuque , Iowa native has decided he wants to tie the knot and start a family ASAP  --  as most of his friends are doing . All he needs is the woman . Trouble is , because of his travel-intensive , 60-hour-a-week work schedule  --  20 hours more than the average American  --  Carlsen still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is braving the perilous ' 90s dating scene by launching a no-nonsense plan to find a mate . Already , Carlsen has spent $7,600 in search of Ms. Right , including joining a $1,000-a-year dating service . He 's ready to shell out another $40,000 for a ring , a wedding and a tropical honeymoon even if that puts a big dent in his anticipated $60,000-to-$120,000 bonus . " I do n't want to be one of those 45-year-old fathers pushing a stroller , " insists the practical Carlsen . He hopes to have three or four children . " By the time my kids are in college , I 'd be ancient . They would n't be able to relate to me . I realized I 'd better get going if I 'm going to do this kid thing . " Carlsen may feel a bit lonesome , but according to the U.S. Census Bureau , he has plenty of company . Largely because so many men in their twenties are now career building in a downsized job market , the number of never-married men in Carlsen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 3.3 million . ( Never-married women in that group have quintupled , to 2.1 million . ) Today , nearly 30% of men ages 30 to 34 have never married and , like Carlsen , they 're not necessarily happy about it . Women may complain that convincing the Y-chromosome crowd to abandon their carefree single life is as tough as getting Jerry Seinfeld to give up cereal , but Carlsen begs to differ . " Some of my married friends say : ' Wow , you 're single . You have a fun car a leased $460-a-month ' 94 Ford Explorer and a cool job , ' " he says . " And I 'm thinking , Sure . They 're married and have these cute kids . These guys have everything I want . " Economics is the major reason so many men are postponing marriage . In 1992 the average 30-to-34-year-old man with a bachelor 's degree and a full-time job earned less annually than in 1975 , after adjusting for inflation : $42,169 vs. $42,449 . Meanwhile , the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 18 remains roughly the same  --  about $80,000 . Says Sharyn Wolf , a New York City psychotherapist and author of Guerrilla Dating Tactics ( Plume , $10.95 ) : " A woman waits to have the right feeling about the right man . But for a man , marriage is more of a timing issue . He tends to feel he needs to be financially stable first . " Carlsen agrees : " I 've passed on two totally doable relationships because my cash position was n't there . " In his devil-may-care twenties , he managed to spend every dollar he earned . Plus , he racked up $22,000 in credit-card debt that he finally paid off in 1992 . As a result , Carlsen 's net worth is now a slim $24,000 , and he rents a white-box $540-a-month studio apartment . But his fortunes seem poised for change . He expects his current $60,000 salary as an investment banker for a Canadian banking firm to be boosted by a $60,000-to-$120,000 bonus in the fall . And Carlsen thinks he 'll be earning in the mid-six figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlsen 's earlier priorities , says Tracy Wilson , a 32-year-old Chicago video producer who dated him from 1982 to 1987 , were to " work , make money and indulge himself . " The oldest of five children of a real estate agent father and a then-homemaker mother , Carlsen was a self-described golden child and a star pitcher who led his Dubuque high school baseball team to a state championship . His parents ' marriage , however , grew increasingly stormy as their finances got shakier . One consequence was that Carlsen had to pay for his 1985 University of Iowa B.S. in finance by managing a campus bar and restaurant and borrowing $14,000 ; today he still owes $7,000 in student loans . His parents separated in 1990 and divorced this year . Carlsen insists that his parents ' difficulties have n't made him shy away from commitments . But since graduating nine years ago , he has bounced around in four cities , holding nine different jobs , including office-equipment salesman in Dallas , mortgage broker in Chicago and financial adviser in San Francisco  --  each position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one . " I wanted to look at the financial world from different angles , " he says . Now researching environmental and technology firms for a new Seattle branch of a Canadian investment bank , Carlsen thinks his job-hopping days are over . " I could stay here for 20 years , " he says enthusiastically . " It 's great to have a hand in funding companies that clean up rivers and protect kids . " Surrounded by college friends who settled in Chicago and , later , in San Francisco , the energetic Carlsen had no problem getting dates after breaking up with Wilson in 1987 . But it was n't until late 1990 that he met his next serious girlfriend , a " very cute " woman seven years his junior who was working in a Bay Area restaurant . The relationship sputtered out last year . " She thought I was a workaholic , " he explains regretfully . Comments Sue Grant , 31 , the older of Carlsen 's two sisters who is a high school gym teacher in Pleasanton , Calif. : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamorous type of girl he could take care of . " Nowadays , Carlsen describes his ideal wife as " my best friend and the most independent person I can find . I want to be able to sit on the sidelines , cheering her on . " While he admits that looks matter to him , he adds that " it 's more important she be athletic , outdoorsy and have a very positive outlook . " With good looks , a handsome income and excellent prospects , Carlsen is hardly the guy you 'd expect to have trouble getting a date . Even statistics rue on his side : Seattle has 92 single men for every 100 single women . But Brian Krueger , co-author of Beyond Putting the Toilet Seat Down ( Armchair Press , $6.95 ) , calls the grunge capital one of the worst cities for dating in the nation : " People there , " he says , " tend to be negative about relationships , unreceptive to small talk and lacking in a sense of humor . " Carlsen has found the city trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  is scary enough in the age of AIDS , but bars makes him queasy anyway . " Even though I 'm aggressive workwise , I think it 's incredibly rude to go up to a complete stranger in a bar and ask for her number . I just ca n't do it . " Nor has his $100-a-month health club , where he works out three times a week , proved fertile ground . " It 's awkward . All these dudes are out to impress , and the women are defensive . " What about the booming business of personal ads ( about $50 for a one-week ad in the Seattle Weekly ) ? " Never ! There is no screening . That 's Fatal Attraction stuff . " And the ' 90s version of a village square  --  computer chat lines like CompuServe , the one Rush Limbaugh used to link up with his new wife  --  does n't appeal to him either . " I 'm too busy to stare at a computer screen , " he says . One Saturday night last October , Carlsen realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a date in two months . I 'd been working most of the day . And I was alone in my apartment watching ESPN , " he recalls ruefully . " I suddenly thought , I 'll be doing this when I 'm 40 . " So when an employee of the Bellevue , Wash . office of the 60-branch Matchmaker International ( MMI ) struck up a conversation with him a few months later , he was hooked . " She said there are a lot of women out there like me , professional , working a lot and hating bars , " he says . Even the $1,000 fee for a year 's membership did n't faze him  --  especially after salespeople showed him a binder full of endorsement letters from married former clients . Unfortunately for Carlsen , such dating services generally have only minimal success making matches . Aaron Ahuvia , a University of Michigan marketing professor , estimates that little more than one in every 15 clients of the nation 's 2,500 dating services wind up marrying people they meet through services . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service clients are women , only about 40% of MMI 's 1,000 Seattle-area clients are  --  a fact that he says MMI did not make clear . MMI manager Brendan Mann says Carlsen did n't ask about the male/female ratio . So far , Carlsen has liked only two of the eight MMI-arranged lunch dates well enough to call them back . The six fizzles included a 22-year-old recent college grad who told him he was too old for her ; a 39-year-old " fingernail artist " with an 18-year-old son , and that zealous vegetarian . " I 'm serious , " he fumes , " and they 're giving me these goofballs . " Responds Mann , who rejected Carlsen 's request for a $500 refund but agreed to provide extra matches : " Tim is very picky . " Still , Carlsen credits the MMI experience for motivating him to chat up strangers . He has since snagged dates by striking up acquaintances with women at the grocery store , the Seattle/Tacoma airport and a local Thai restaurant and then exchanging business cards . These days , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy show ( cost : about $75 ) . Even when women initiate the date , traditionalist Carlsen insists on paying . This new $450-a-month expense does n't bother Carlsen , since he needs only about two-thirds of his anticipated gross pay for day-to-day expenses . In fact , now that he 's making serious dough , he 's eager to spend it more wisely . If his bonus is big enough , he plans to shuck his noisy apartment , which overlooks roaring Highway I-5 , and buy a home  --  hoping to cut taxes in the process . He 's wavering between a $300,000 house on Mercer Island , an affluent community east of Seattle " with a good school system " or a $200,000 condo " that I can rent out when I get married and buy a house . " Carlsen plans to boost his meager savings too . He has only $12,000 in an Individual Retirement Account , which is invested in the aggressive mutual fund Fidelity Stock Selector ( 12-month return to June 24 : 4.8% ) , $7,000 in the balanced fund Fidelity Asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . He aims to pile up $200,000 in savings by age 40 and then put aside $10,000 to $20,000 a year so that he will have $120,000 in annual investment income by age 60 , when he hopes to retire . To accomplish this , Carlsen plans to start making maximum use of the simplified employee pension ( SEP ) plan this year that his employer recently introduced , which lets him contribute and deduct from his taxes as much as $22,500 a year , tax deferred , in whatever investment he chooses . What 's more , he hopes to help his mom , LaVonne , through her upcoming retirement from a food sales job and offer some financial support to his four siblings . " That 's what big brothers are for , " he says . But Carlsen does n't let those weighty concerns distract him . There are potential wives to be met  --  perhaps during the scuba-diving week 's vacation in Cancun planned next month ( about $1,400 ) . Despite the past year 's setbacks , he continues to be optimistic about his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to happen , " says Carlsen with a grin . " She 's out there ! " THE ADVICE Dump the dating service . Instead of paying to arrange awkward dates with strangers , says Larry Mauksch , a couples therapist at the University of Washington , Carlsen might consider joining a bicycling club or volunteering to work with community groups that teach sports to kids . Such activities would increase his chances of getting to know women who share his values and interests . Bonus : They 're inexpensive . Hold off buying a house until you find a mate . A $160,000 mortgage on a $200,000 condo would cost about $19,000 a year in mortgage interest and property tax and would save only $4,700 in income tax , calculates Susan Nelson , a local financial planner . But if Carlsen waits to buy until he and his intended can pool their income and afford , say , a $240,000 mortgage on a $300,000 house , they could then save $7,000 in taxes . Get moving on that savings impulse . Nelson recommends Carlsen earmark $16,000 for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( recent yield : 3.3% ; 800-435-4000 ) and begin a fund for a house down payment . Then , if he starts contributing $22,500 to his SEP annually and his retirement funds grow at 12% a year  --  possible if he invests in aggressive stock funds such as Warburg Pincus Growth &; Income ( no load ; 12-month return to June 24 : 11.2% ; 800-257-5614 )  --  he could have $253,500 in his SEP and IRA by age 40 . But he must also invest $18,000 outside the plan every year between ages 40 and 60 to reach his goal of $120,000 in annual income in today 's dollars . Trim that wedding plan . Nelson says Carlsen should budget just $10,000 for the engagement ring , honeymoon and wedding . Traditionally , the bride 's family picks up the wedding tab . If the couple pay their own way , observes Mauksch , then his bride should share costs . Carlson agreed with Nelson 's advice about saving and about delaying buying a house . He plans to continue meeting the dates that MMI 's manager finds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service again . " It was an experiment that did n't work , " he says . As for other ways to meet women , " I 'm hoping this article will solve my problems , " he says , only half-jokingly . " I 'll take it from there .
