<p> Other than the fact that he killed himself , the last day of Billy Glover 's life was one of his best . <p> That bright fall morning he was his usual warm self , joking with his parents , Joan and Bill . He aced his high school exams . He treated himself to a horseback ride . <p> There were a few wrinkles . The horse threw Billy , and a casual girlfriend dumped him . His best friend had to work and was unable to go to a football game they had planned to attend . And Billy left the lights on in his van , so the battery died . <p> But those would seem minor snarls in the life of a healthy teenager . And he was healthy . Billy Glover was an imposing 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds , but not athletic . Lazy , but not lethargic . He liked sports but was not particularly competitive . He played several instruments , including trombone in the Roswell High School marching band , but had no interest in taking music lessons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even managed one chapter of a science fiction novel . He was a whiz at computers . <p> Billy yearned for a serious girlfriend and more friends . But those are staples in any 16-year-old 's wish book . <p> Nothing , and nobody , warned Joan and Bill that on Nov. 15 , 1985 , their jocular , handsome son would sit down next to the coffee table in their living room , pen a short apology , point a .22-magnum pistol at his temple and die . <p> Billy 's explanation : " Dear Mom and Dad , <p> Please do n't think this has anything to do with you . I 'm just fed up . Simply that . Do n't blame yourselves for what I 'm about to do . <p> Love , Billy " <p> They blamed themselves anyhow . Bill , CEO of a computer company , blamed himself for working such long hours . And for owning the pistol that he thought was there to protect his family . He also wondered if he should have insisted that Billy stick with organized sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Joan blamed herself for not sensing Billy 's pain ; the two of them , after all , were so close . And she blamed herself for not asking the " right " question two weeks before he died , the day she and Billy sat down together and watched an after-school TV special on suicide . <p> " You 'd never do that , would you Billy ? " she had said , more command than question . <p> " Mom , I would never do that , " Billy reassured her . <p> " I should have asked , ' What do you do when you have thoughts of ending your life ? ' " <p> She 's had 12 long years to come up with the " right " question . <p> The couple was at a business dinner that November Friday night . They were enjoying a jazz session at the Buckhead restaurant when , suddenly , Joan experienced something she 's never endured before or since . She had , for lack of a better description , a " sneezing fit . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> What happened next might be called a parent 's worst nightmare  --  except most parents could never bear to dream such an awful thing . <p> The Glovers unlocked the front door of their Roswell home and found Billy , the son they had adopted at age 3 months , the funny , bright , musical kid who taught them about unconditional love and laughed at their jokes . Their only child was lying in a crimson puddle . <p> Bill tried CPR , while Joan dialed 911 . But Billy already was dead . <p> The next hours were inside that ghastly bubble that true grief blows . They are hours when you still expect , somehow , to emerge unscathed . They are sleepwalking , sedated , shock-absorbed hours . They are not real . <p> But life is , and it goes on . Friends cut away the damaged carpet . Bill lost 40 pounds in the next 30 days . Joan would report to work at her husband 's office , only to spend most of the day lying on the floor right next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends and family avoided the subject of suicide . Whenever the Glovers would bring up Billy , " a sort of gray look " would appear on most faces , Bill says . " A lot of people leave your life . They simply ca n't handle it . And that 's loss on top of loss . " <p> The Glovers stopped laughing . <p> " I had been a CEO for 22 years , " Bill says . " I had been an Army first sergeant . I thought I was tough and smart , and that life could n't hand me a problem that I could n't quickly dispatch . " <p> He believed support groups were for sissies . But he also , instinctively , knew that what he calls " civilians "  --  those whose lives have been untouched by suicides  --  had no answers for him . So , three weeks after his son 's death , the desperate and grieving Glovers heard about Atlanta 's Link Counseling Center and went to a support group recommended to them . They arrived early , Bill says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out in the church parking lot and introduced himself to two other couples who also were early . All six parents were at the meeting for the first time . All had lost sons either age 16 or 17 . All the boys had died within a 15-day period . All were buried within a 50-foot circle in the same cemetery . Finally , here were the people who knew how they felt . <p> " Through that fog of grief , what I realized was that these were my brothers and sisters , " Bill says . " Together we helped each other survive . " <p> Even now , 12 years later , Bill is a facilitator at SOS ( Survivors of Suicide ) meetings , and both Glovers volunteer at Link . They tell their story whenever they can , speaking honestly to help others . And they are confident they have helped . Suicidal teens have talked to them , perhaps recognizing a sincerity born of knowledge . <p> In their stylishly-appointed town house , the Glovers sit side by side , confederates and survivors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both can quote Billy 's last note by heart . Both still cry when they recount the details of his last day . <p> But their friend Iris Bolton at the Link had told them early on to look for " gifts " that would come from the tragedy . And they have found them . <p> Joan decided five years ago to pursue acting , her childhood passion . " I 've always been a comic , and Billy was my best audience . " Now she appears in TV ads , on billboards and in films . She knows Billy would approve . <p> Bill says he is more tolerant now , more open . He is still a CEO , but a far different kind . One day a velvety black butterfly attached itself to his car hood , and Bill stood watching , hand outstretched . The butterfly walked up his palm and stayed there 10 minutes . <p> " When you are involved in a suicide , you ca n't help but feel foul about yourself . I felt as if this pure little creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Billy 's death , neither of the Glovers can tolerate pettiness . The worst already had happened . Joan 's mastectomy and Bill 's business bankruptcy  --  both soon after their child 's death  --  seemed minor obstacles . ( Bill believes the bankruptcy was a direct result of the suicide . His bid for venture capital failed ; business associates told him later there was a fear " I was going perfectly flaky . " ) <p> The greatest gift , the Glovers agree , is the ability to share with others the warning signs of suicide . <p> " A few days after Billy died , I was worrying about what to do with his music , " Bill says , eyes brimming . " He had a vast number of CDs . " <p> Bill went to his son 's room . The music was gone . Billy already had given away his prized collection . In 1985 , Bill and Joan Glover lost their son to suicide.Today , both parents volunteer at Atlanta 's Link Counseling Center and tell their story in hopes of helping others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
