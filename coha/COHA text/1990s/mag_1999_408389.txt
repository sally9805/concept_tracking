During totalhealth 's conversation ( on page 22 ) with Leigh Taylor-Young the health concern involving the ingredients commonly used in commercial cosmetics was discussed . totalhealth wanted the readers to have more information and asked writer Wendy Block , who specializes in the personal care products field to discuss the subject with Jeffrey Light , president of Jason Natural , manufacturer of an extensive line of natural personal care products primarily distributed through health food stores . // Wendy Block : Jeffrey , it 's exciting that more and more people now choose organics and other foods and supplements from health food stores because they know how important these are for their health . But not many people seem to understand that what they put on their skin , hair , nails and their teeth can also affect their health profoundly . Why do so few people buy their personal care products at health food stores ? Jeffrey Light : About five out of every 100 people who shop at health food stores also buy personal care products there . It 's entirely possible that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know there is a difference . It 's up to the health food stores to help-to open customers ' eyes and ears , so they understand the value difference . It 's up to the sales staff to answer questions about price or ingredients , to encourage consumers to experiment with products they 've never tried before . WB : Let 's compare health food store personal care products to those in the mass market . Natural personal care products-in general  --  contain as many healthy ingredients as possible and as close as possible to no ingredients that can cause problems . JL : The first thing you notice about health food store personal care products is that most manufacturers do n't use FD &C; colors because those are petroleum by-products . The health food industry does not support mineral oil , paraffin waxes , petroleum , and in most cases animal by-products in the products , they sell in health food stores . WB : FD &C; stands for food , drug , and cosmetic , as classified by the Food and Drug Administration or FDA . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean natural vegetable and animal ; it tends to mean natural vegetable . People do n't like to have animals killed for the beautification of a human being . It 's just a sensitivity . WB : What 's the problem with petroleum ? JL : It 's more ofa circumstance . Right after World War II , synthetics became prominent . You can make almost anything using petroleum as a base . Coal tar was also synthesized , to make FD &C; colors for makeup as well as dandruff , psoriasis and eczema treatments . Some ofthese treatments have been found to cause cancer . Mineral oil , also from petroleum , which parents used to give children for stomach problems , was found to absorb vitamins back through the intestines and flush them out of the body . The history of synthesized products , whether used topically or taken internally , has been problematic . Most people who shop in health food stores would rather not have products synthesized from petroleum . WB : My understanding is that the natural cosmetics industry is regulated similarly to the mass market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmetics is one of the few areas left with very little regulation , almost none . So it 's very important to know your manufacturer . WB : To trust the manufacturer . Or if consumers are n't yet familiar with manufacturers , they need to be able to trust the personal care sales staff at their health food store to recommend quality brands . JL : Health food stores pride themselves on their ability to communicate and help the consumer . And health food store magazines such as totalhealth can help when they run articles informing consumers about seasonal skin care and solving topical problems including antiaging . Anti-aging nutrients such as vitamin C  --  which also moisturizes-pycnogenol and grape seed extract lead the movement . WB : Because of their antioxidant qualities . Do nutrients that act as antioxidants in supplement form , have the same properties when they 're included in crimes ? JL : Vitamin C scavenges free radicals in both forms . There 's a lot of research proving that when someone applies Vitamin C crime before going out into the sun , it helps protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hinder the formation of free radicals . WB : How does the delivery system work for topical products ? JL : Why are there 50 different manufacturers producing vitamin C products ? There are maybe 50 different ways to explain moisturization and the synergistic benefits of combining different raw materials . There 's one concept of applying an antioxidant topically , but 50 different ideas for combining it with various ingredients . What kind of base do you use ? Do you put vitamin C in water and apply it to the skin ? We do n't think that 's smart . WB : That 's because C is water soluble and it ca n't stay active . JL : The minute vitamin C hits water , internally or externally , it starts to degrade . It does n't have a long active life . That 's why vitamin C goes right through your body . Your body ca n't store it . Our philosophy is moisturization because every day as we age the cells that used to protect us from free radical formation-anti-aging-or used to provide moisture , start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us every day . Add those days up , year after year . We 're going from plums to raisins ; particularly people who spend a lot of time in the sun their skin ages much more quickly . We mix active raw materials into bases that provide long-term benefits and last a long time . Our hyper-C serum is a microemulsion of oils and water . Twenty-four to 48 hours after applying it , one still feels the moisturization . WB : Now that you mention sunscreens and the sun , let 's talk about some differences between health food store sunscreens and mass market products . I know many natural sunscreens do n't use PABA and do use titanium dioxide and zinc oxide . JL : Health food store sunscreens do n't use PABA , ( or para-aminobenzoic acid ) an acid found in vitamin B complex , because PABA has been found by dermatologists to cause photosensitivity sensitivity to light . Titanium dioxide and micronized zinc oxide are used as natural sunscreens , but they would n't be in commercial brands because they 're more expensive . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Health food store sunscreens use natural fragrances ; the mass market uses synthetics . WB : One more sunscreen issue . In the past few years new information about the benefits of sunscreen and the dangers of our atmosphere have led experts to recommend that people wear sunscreen all year long . JL : The world is changing . Many people have more free time , and they enjoy spending that time outside . You need to wear sunscreen every day , even though the only sunlight exposure you get could be from driving on a long trip or from working in a windowed office building with the sun rising or setting . Whether it 's an SPF 8 , a 10 , a 12 or a 15 , some sunscreen is better than none . If you have a convertible or you 're vacationing , make sure you have some coverage and wear a hat . Since skin cancer develops over a 20-year period , the old days of lying in the sun and getting burned are history . WB : You mentioned people with sensitive skin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food store personal care products that are significantly different from more commerical brands . Is the mass market paying attention to the natural personal care industry ? JL : What 's happening now is that large mass marketers are realizing that the public wants to better understand what it 's buying . There 's an opportunity for the health food marketplace to benefit from this growing awareness . WB : The opportunity to provide top quality , nourishing products and develop a long-term satisfied customer base . JL : Yes . But alongside the professionally produced personal care lines , when consumers shop in health food stores they 'll see a number of " loving hands " and " old time , grandma 's formulation " products made by individuals in their homes . These are items you 'd expect to find at a quaint gift store . I hope people will understand the difference between these and the leading companies in the health food industry whose manufacturing facilities turn out products as sophisticated as Estee Lauder and Revlon . Customers need to repsect both . WB : But its 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal top department store brands in quality and benefits . JL : Products can produce the same benefits but the philosophies are different on what road to take to get there . WB : You 're talking about using vegetable oils brimmining with live , active ingredients as opposed to petroleum by-priducts , which are essentially dead ? JL : Yes . Mineral oil , a fossil fuel , has been around for millions of years under the ground . No vitamins , no absorbable minerals . There 's no nutritional value to a petroleum by-products . But a moisturizer that contains herbs , botanicals , essential oils , and flowers-all these things are alive . They provide active benefits . Furthermore , when people buy personal care products at their health food store , they can learn what sorts of binders and fillers ar eused , whether the product contains animal or vegetable ingredients . Customers have a right to know these things . JL : Mass market cremes can be made stable . They last 20 years because mineral oil does n't go rancid as vegetable oils do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make , forever . Mineral oil is crystal white like water no matter where you buy it in the world . For vegetable oils , we use rice bran and vitamin E , or sunflower or safflower or soy oil . Depending on what region of this country or Canada or Mexico it 's grown in , what time of year and how rich the soil , the vegetable oils are different colors . Sometimes they 're crystal white , sometimes golden yellow . When you put that into a creme , you wind up with a color that varies . Sometimes people worry because one day a health food store creme is crystal white and one day it 's ecru . Contrast that with products a woman sees walking through a Bath &; Body Works or a Body Shop , where everything appears beautful and natural . Everything is a beautiful color that matches a bathroom or kitchen in their house . Cremes , cleansers and shampoos in a health food store are not presented by color walls . The packaging is not as slick , because in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle , not the bottle itself . We do n't use synthetic FD &C; coal tar colors ; we use natural colors that fade over time . So most of the product in the health food store are in opaque bottles to protect the product 's natural color . WB : Many health food store person care products are expiration dated for several years . JL : Just like milk . All Jason products are dated for three years . All companies that are stand-up manufacturers will expiration date their products , so customers will know how long the cosmetics are good for . Some manufacturers choose not to use preservatives . It 's up to responsible health food store salespeople to reiterate that once these cosmetics are opened , they be stored in the refrigerator , also like milk . WB : One of the issues you 've touched on throughout our conversation is ingredient and product prices . The implication is that natural personal care products cost more than their mass market counterparts . JL : I mentioned the issue of cost , because people refer to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal care category , I think you 'll find most products cost between $5-$30 in health food stores . In department stores , when you get into fine cremes , they start at $40 and go up to $125 or $150 . When people shop at department stores , they expect to pay more . But I do n't think there 's that much difference in the quality of a $125 department store product compared to a $30 health food store product . The packaging is probably a lot different , but I think you 're probably looking at big companies that put a lot of money into advertising and promotion , but not necessarily into the ingredients . That 's marketing . Salons are not cheaper , either . Target or K-mart or Price Club have inexpensive products . It has to do with consumer education . The adventure that awaits people who explore the personal care area is that they could find products that are popularly priced and that have the benefits they 're looking for , at competitive prices . WB : Thank you Jeffrey . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
