Times Square may be in the midst of a makeover , but on Broadway change comes slowly . A year after Rent was supposed to have revolutionized the Broadway musical , the Great White Way scarcely seems to have noticed . Nearly all this season 's big musicals are arriving , as usual , in the last two frantic weeks before the Tony Award nominations . And far from showcasing a new generation of downtown talents , like Rent 's Jonathan Larson or Bring in ' Da Noise , Bring in ' Da Funk 's Savion Glover , this season could pass for a Friars Club reunion of old Broadway tunesmiths , with Cy Coleman ( Sweet Charity ) , John Kander and Fred Ebb ( Cabaret ) , Maury Yeston ( Nine ) and Leslie Bricusse ( Stop the World  --  I Want to Get Off ) all back on the boards . <P> It even looked as if this season would bring another of those old-fashioned megabudget bombs of Broadway legend . What else could one expect from a $10 million musical called Titanic , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar catastrophe , after some well-publicized technical problems ( the ship had a bit of trouble sinking ) during previews ? <P> But Titanic , it turns out , is no disaster , just an uninspired shipboard melodrama with watery songs , predictable musings about the hubris of the enterprise , and a surfeit of cliched characters . They include the ship 's craven owner , who keeps urging the captain to increase the speed ; aristocrats like the John Jacob Astors and the Isidor Strauses , who drown with dignity ; and some tiresomely idealistic Irish immigrants in steerage . What director Richard Jones and scenic designer Stewart Laing have accomplished , however , is an imaginative , even haunting , stage rendering of the sinking : the stage tilts ominously ; faces of the doomed passengers appear at portholes like apparitions . Titanic 's Broadway voyage will almost surely have a quick end , but its creators , like the shipbuilders , at least dreamed big . <P> Steel Pier , by contrast , has been carried to Broadway by far more favorable winds . It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , thanks to the hit revival of their 1975 show , Chicago  --  and a premise that seems made to order for the team and for talented choreographer Susan Stroman : a 1930s dance marathon in Atlantic City . The show is cannily mounted , bouncy and often tuneful , professional all the way . Yet it 's still a disappointment . <P> One problem is David Thompson 's book , with its tired cocktail of characters left over from They Shoot Horses , Do n't They ? , and an odd Twilight Zone chaser . Karen Ziemba combines Broadway pizazz with shy-girl vulnerability as a contestant who partners a stunt pilot ( Daniel McDonald ) but is secretly married to the marathon 's slimy emcee ( Gregory Harrison ) . The mix of nostalgia , cynicism and period artifice , however , keeps us at arm 's length from the material ( beware of any show in which one character calls another " Flyboy " ) . The ersatz- ' 30s numbers are pleasant but forgettable , although Debra Monk , as a marathon veteran , puts across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , Steel Pier just seems tinny .
