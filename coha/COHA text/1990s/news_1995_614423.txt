<p> That window-shaking , ba-boom ba-boom thundering from cars all Freaknik weekend sounds like the ching-ching of a cash register to Atlanta rap duo Tag Team . They 've made quite a living off of that ruckus . Big homes in Buckhead . Luxury sedans parked out front . <p> All thanks to the heavyweight champion of ba-boom ( or bass ) music , " Whoomp ! There It Is . " <p> But if following up the biggest single in the history of rap music - 5.5 million sold - is causing them any distress , they 're trying hard not to show it . <p> There 's not a bead of sweat in sight . <p> In a small , nondescript studio off Cobb Parkway , Tag Team members Steve " Rollin ' " Gibson and Cecil " DC " Glenn sit back as owner-engineer Don McKinzie scans a disc for a particular groove . Glenn 's stocky build has melted in the cushy sofa facing an overhead television , which plays the video for " Creep " by local R &B/rap; trio TLC . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both the MTV and BET circles . But as was also the case with TLC , a lot of people are hedging their bets that Tag Team is too gimmicky , too attached to one particular persona , to have legs the second time around . <p> " They ( TLC ) came back like nobody expected them to , " Glenn remarks , about the trio 's double-platinum " Crazysexycool " album . A knowing smirk stretches across his face . " They just put together some good music , got back out there , and slammed ! " <p> Gibson , seated behind the production board , chimes in with his usual " Mmmm hmmm . " Again , with a knowing confidence . <p> This is the last day of studio work for the duo 's second album , " Audio Entertainment , " a Bellmark Records release due in stores in May . ( The release date is not firm yet , but the first single " Funkey Situation , " is expected in stores May 5 . ) The album includes gritty hip- hop ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Let the Music Play " ) and the mindless party anthems you expect from the duo that created the 1993 equivalent of " Take Me Out to the Ballgame . " <p> The new album hints at a range that people do n't expect from " a regular bass group , " Glenn offers . " Our whole thing is getting people to know Tag Team music . And with Tag Team music you do n't know what you 're going to get . Because we just make songs . Whether it is hip-hop , bass , R &B,; music is universal . And we have a wide range . <p> " Our whole thing is positive , " adds Glenn , clearly the more talkative of the two . ( He 's the one who booms " Party Peopllllle " at the beginning of " Whoomp ! " ) " Not goody-goody . Not angels . Just not all the tripping , not all the hard core . " <p> " We respect people , " Gibson says to sum it up . " If you categorize us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . If you do n't wan na have no fun , you ai n't trying to be positive , then you need to just go on . We 'll just roll on , do our thing . " <p> Gibson and Glenn have lots of practice fending off criticism . Being considered a bass group is often like wearing a scarlet letter in the music industry - at least outside the South , where bass music originated and enjoys its best sales . <p> " I think bass music is making some inroads , " says Havelock Nelson , rap columnist for Billboard magazine . " And it 's definitely selling a lot of records . But it 's still , also , definitely regional . " <p> Nelson had just returned from a " Bassfest " in Orlando , which he says " got boring , quick . Bass is fun , escapist music that 's good for the moment . At a party or on the block or whatever . But it does n't hold the interest as long as some of the better hip-hop . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choice for those creeping past Underground Atlanta on a summer afternoon , usually comes from one-hit wonders . Most of them appear on low-budget , independent labels . And if they have a video to accompany their one hit , it 's almost certain to have some near-nude women in it with their backs to the camera . Thanks , in part , to the pornographic pioneer of bass , Luther " 2 Live Crew " Campbell . <p> " Let 's just put the stigma of booty-shaking music aside for a minute , " Glenn says . " Most people in this game concentrate on that single . That one hit . And that 's just because a lot of albums that come from these groups from the Southeast are n't solid . The production 's not solid . The way it 's mixed is not solid . And people would just rather listen to the single . And that 's the way it 's been for a long time . " <p> Tag Team fell right into step with that pattern , completing the debut album " Whoomp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To me , it was a disaster , " says Gibson of the platinum-selling album ) . The duo spent the past three months focusing on " Audio Entertainment . " <p> " I think Tag Team goes beyond tthe bass realm , " adds Nelson , who 's heardc the album . " They are grounded in hip-hop , so they bring that to the table . They have more textural and lyrical depth . They are definitely the darlings for those who like that kinder and gentler , fun and not threatening music . But hard-core hip-hop heads are definitely not checking for this ( upcoming ) record . " <p> " Our peers are real critical , " says Glenn . " We 're doing a lot of this stuff for our peers . I mean , we 're doing this for the fans to make money and all , but we really want our peers to know that we ai n't no joke . " <p> Which is an obvious concern . Tag Team is the first rap group to be embraced by the epitome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record " Whoomp ! There It Went " for the children 's album " Mickey Un-Rapped . " <p> In the " accept no crossover " world of hip-hop , that smelled like a sellout . <p> " When Disney came to us we were like , ' Hell no ! ' everybody 's going to say ' Hammer , ' " said Glenn , referring to the crossover rapper Hammer . " Everybody 's going to say , ' Damn they sold out . ' When we did the ' Addams Family ' ( the " Addams Family Values " soundtrack ) it was the same thing . ( The single for the May 12 movie about a piglet ) ' Gordy , ' same thing . <p> " But we really have n't caught heat for doing those things like you would think we would catch heat , " he adds . " I think people see that it 's all about hustling . Whether you are on the streets or in an office building you got ta take an opportunity , make the best of it , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all those twisted people that have something to say , success is the best revenge , " Glenn says . " We sold 5.5 million singles last time , but we 're out to sell 5.5 million albums now . <p> " I wish it was albums , " Glenn adds . " Albums without samples . Oh boy !
