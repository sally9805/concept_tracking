<p> The Buffalo Bills are aging . The stars that took them to four consecutive Super Bowls are retired or close to it . <p> The Pittsburgh Steelers lost players to free agency and entered this season without their top three cornerbacks from last year . And the Kansas City Chiefs began 1997 with nine new starters . <p> Yet all are winning , a combined 18-9 , because they have coaches who can carry them when players ca n't : Marv Levy in Buffalo , Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh and Marty Schottenheimer in Kansas City . <p> Yes , in the NFL , coach is the most important position  --  as long as a team gets the right one . Many do n't , which is why there were 11 new head coaches in the NFL this season . <p> " There will always be changes in personnel , but once you get a good coach , he 's a constant , " says John Butler , the Bills'general manager , who has worked with Levy for 11 seasons and admires Cowher and Schottenheimer . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let their players know who 's boss , and they never make excuses . They may lose players , but they carry on . " <p> Take Levy . Last season at this time , his Bills were 6-3 , now they 're 5-4 . <p> Yet their quarterbacks are Todd Collins and Alex Van Pelt , who entered the season with a combined 16 NFL appearances and four starts ( all by Collins ) in two seasons . The center is Dusty Zeigler , who had two token appearances as a rookie last year . <p> They replace Kelly ( 159 games , 159 starts ) and center Kent Hull ( 170 games , 169 starts ) , the unsung star of the Bills ' Super Bowl teams . <p> But there 's the one constant : Levy . <p> Of the 11 new coaches this season , eight had previous NFL experience . <p> Yet two of the three most successful , Steve Mariucci of the San Francisco 49ers ( 8-1 ) and Jim Fassel of the New York Giants ( 6-3 ) , are first-time coaches . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6-3 ) , is the one recycled celebrity coach to succeed . He 's actually a game ahead of the New England Patriots , the team he took to the Super Bowl last year while the Jets were 1-15 . <p> Mariucci is unusual because most new coaches do n't take over winning teams . <p> He 's also only 42 , head coach for a year at Cal but never more than a quarterbacks coach in the NFL . And he is coaching a team that has won five Super Bowls since 1981 and won 10 games or more every season for the last 14 . <p> The pressure of that situation showed when Steve Young had a concussion and Jerry Rice was lost with a knee injury in an opening-game loss in Tampa . The next week , Mariucci seemed unsure about his quarterback situation , finally sitting out Young and playing rookie Jim Druckenmiller , with just a month as a 49er , in St. Louis . <p> San Francisco 's transition period was eased by a light schedule that has resulted in an eight-game winning streak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's weakest division . That allowed the 49ers time to develop Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes as a tandem to replace Rice , and the Niners scored 30 points or more for five consecutive games . <p> It also gave Mariucci time to accustom himself to a veteran team  --  and for the players and assistant coaches to get used to him . And it allowed Mariucci a grace period  --  at 8-1 , how much criticism can be leveled at him ? <p> His real test wo n't come until the playoffs . <p> Fassel came up the conventional way . He was offensive coordinator in Arizona last season after stints with the Giants , Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders as a quarterback coach . <p> He came into an ideal situation . Dan Reeves was fired after winning only 11 games in two seasons and for criticizing general manager George Young and the rest of the front office for leaving him out of personnel decisions . <p> They did the opposite with Fassel , allowing him to draft players he wanted 1-2 , taking wide receiver Ike Hilliard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both were hurt  --  Hilliard is gone for the season with a neck injury . <p> But the team has won five in a row after starting 1-3 and is in first place in the NFC East , a game ahead of the Washington Redskinsand two games ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys . <p> Just as important , they 're 3-0 in the division , a key factor in tiebreakers . <p> Mariucci and Fassel are the rule , not the exception . <p> Most of the league 's successful coaches are in their first NFL head-coaching job : Cowher , the Green Bay Packers ' Mike Holmgren , the Jacksonville Jaguars ' Tom Coughlin , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ' Tony Dungy , the Minnesota Vikings ' Dennis Green , the Carolina Panthers ' Dom Capers and the Eagles ' Ray Rhodes . <p> Why are the new guys more successful than retreads Mike Ditka in New Orleans , Dick Vermeil in St. Louis or Dan Reeves in Atlanta ( all 2-7 ) ? In large part , because they 're more flexible . <p> " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage that a guy who 's been successful elsewhere does , " says Dungy , who in his second season seems almost sure to coach Tampa Bay to its first winning record in 16 years . <p> Dungy is 42 , still young for a head coach . But he seems to have been around forever  --  he was Pittsburgh 's defensive coordinator at 28 under Chuck Noll . He was also under considerable pressure because , by 30 , he was being mentioned as a head-coaching candidate , specifically as a prospect to become the NFL 's first black head coach . <p> " I did n't really take all that seriously , " he says . " I certainly would n't have been the same coach then that I am now . And after Art Shell got the Raiders job ( in 1989 ) , the racial thing cooled off . I think a lot of owners said ' OK , now we have one . There 's less pressure . ' " <p> Dungy , one of three black coaches now , is an example of blending influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco and coached under Noll , a four-time Super Bowl winner in Pittsburgh . From there he worked for Schottenheimer in Kansas City and Green in Minnesota before getting the job in Tampa last year after Jimmy Johnson and Steve Spurrier turned it down . <p> " I can honestly say the extra experience made me more ready , " he says . " I know how Chuck Noll did things , I use some things that I got from Marty and Denny . I know how all of them dealt with things when they went good or bad and I apply that here . " <p> Fassel is five years older than Dungy . He was a head coach at the University of Utah . <p> He 's installed it in New York , but he has also been flexible . He knows that without center Brian Williams , Hilliard and running backs Rodney Hampton and Barber , he 's best off relying on his defense , particularly with an inexperienced quarterback , second-year man Danny Kanell . <p> But the constant is the way he deals with players and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback controversy  --  something Parcells did not do across the Hudson River  --  by making it clear that as long as the team was winning with Kanell , he would remain the quarterback over Dave Brown , who started the last three years and was hurt against Dallas . <p> At 72 , Levy is the oldest man ever to coach in the NFL . He was let go by Kansas City after the 1982 season just as he was straightening out a team that had lost for a decade . The Chiefs did n't get turned around until seven years and two coaches later , when Schottenheimer arrived . <p> Schottenheimer has n't had a losing year in 12 full seasons with the Chiefs and the Browns before them . <p> Maybe , someday , he 'll replace Levy as the grandfather of all coaches . <p> " We know we 're going to change personnel each year , and we know we 'll go through good periods and bad , " Butler says . " But the players know one thing  --  they 'll do it the Marv Levy @ @ @
