<p> SANTA FE - Conceptual art is hard to do well . <p> There is the simple fact the artist must be adroit with the chosen material . Right there , many fail - their conceptual-art installations sink in amateurism . <p> But if the artist is skilled at it , there are still other challenges . If the concept is too simple - using illuminated and burned-out light bulbs as a metaphor for human life , for instance - then the concept becomes a cliche and a victim of its own obviousness . <p> On the other hand , it 's easy to put too much intellect into the work . The artist winds up relying on viewers to put together the meaning as if arranging the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle . This can be effective , but it can also leave the viewer thinking the art is just a footnote to the artist 's statement . <p> Features 31 artists <p> These things come to mind while viewing " Longing and Belonging : From the Faraway Nearby , " the ambitious exhibition here that features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The show , organized by the nonprofit Site Santa Fe organization to make this city an important contemporary-art mecca , is at two locations simultaneously through Oct. 8 . One is the Museum of Fine Arts ; the other the Site Santa Fe warehouse just outside downtown . <p> And there is nothing amateurish about it - not when you have artists of the caliber of Bruce Naumann , Jenny Holzer , Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramovic participating . <p> Still , that does n't mean problems do n't come up - artists trying to be too simple or , paradoxically , too complex . Overall , however , I found the show an invigorating success . <p> I understand the allure of simplicity - it can be as profound as a spare image in a haiku . But it can also be too easy . The strings of lights I mentioned above belong to Felix Gonzalez-Torres ' " Untitled ( America ) . " A Cuban-born New York artist whose installations deal with the impact of AIDS , he has one here that suffers from superficial symbolism . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and Amsterdam - constructed the very simple " Knife Ladder , " which is just what it says it is . As a metaphor for the dangers inherent in growth , it makes sense . But I looked for a couple of seconds , said " Got it , " and strolled on . It failed to move me . <p> Two others hit the mark <p> Simple work also needs to be allusive , and that is difficult for artists to achieve . Two here do it beautifully , however - Valeska Soares , a New York-based Brazilian , and Kapoor , the India-born sculptor and painter who lives in London . <p> Kapoor has two different works in this exhibit - one at each site . <p> While different , both are strong . <p> His " Oblivion , " at the warehouse , consists of three huge blocks of quarried limestone arranged in an arc reminiscent of Stonehenge . He has sculpted holes in the center of each one , also smoothing out or chipping away the surface around each hole . <p> Silent but suggestive <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just for that and no more . But there is more . Those holes suggest eardrums . While minimalist , the work suggests the presence of humanity in the same way the noise in a seashell reminds us of the ocean . Yet it is absolutely silent . <p> Kapoor asks us to listen to art as well as to just look at - that to be moved by it takes effort to imagine it doing things it ca n't physically do . ( It also helps that these big stones are like giant stereo speakers , ready to blast music . Rock music , I presume . ) <p> At the Museum of Fine Arts , Kapoor gets an entire room for his " Untitled , " a painting on the wall - or perhaps a painted wall - that has a mysterious , sculptural effect . You ca n't get close enough to tell if it 's protruding from the wall or recessed into it . Crimson in color with a ball-like center , it can also be seen as alluding to the ear . But it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activate sound <p> Soares ' room-size " Sinners " places , on the warehouse 's concrete floor , rows of narrow metal benches coated with layers of thick , white wax . The soft indentations look as if they were made by the knees of the devout . Motion detectors sense the presence of viewers and prompt an audio system to play heartbeatlike noises - the rapidity and loudness depend on the type of movement . <p> I like this piece because , besides its quieting effect , it is about the physical - rather than spiritual - power of prayer . Those indentations seem so soft to the touch , like skin . Art , too , can be physically comforting when it chooses . Here 's one that succeeds . <p> Since I found the best of the more intellectually complex installations wonderfully rewarding and thoughtful , I 'd rather not dwell on those with shortcomings . But there are some that get lost in their ideas , such as the contributions by Lorna Simpson , Chie Matsui , Carlos Capelan and Allison Rossiter . <p> But one really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmore , a Canada-based Native American artist . Traveling from Canada to Santa Fe , the artist collected souvenir mugs to smash - she has built the ceramic bits and pieces into a wall mosaic at the museum . And she also collected soil along the way , to cast and fire into new , more rugged-looking mugs . <p> There are 168 of them - one for each victim of the Oklahoma City bombing . They have been placed atop pedestal-like metal stakes , meant as a memorial . This is the first artwork I 've seen about that infamous act . But it 's a cold and impersonal one - all wrapped up in the artist 's attempt to find objects to symbolize her attitudes about the way we view the land and earthen materials . What 's missing is a sense of loss . She 's conceptualized the horror of the loss of life right out of the piece . <p> On the other hand , there are two artists whose conceptual work about violence does have a punch . One , strangely enough , is funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video artist Pierrick Sorin . Getting a room to himself at the warehouse , he creates a subversive , insistent and annoying image about a foreigner 's attitude to the U.S. It 's free of all the **27;1218;TOOLONG attitudes that are so often a part of Southwest art . He sees our great country as a place to get shot ! <p> Short vignettes <p> Three short vignettes run simultaneously on a large screen - in the central one , a tourist with a video camera gets shot and falls all over the place like a silent-movie comedian taking a pratfall . Or like David Byrne in the wacky music video for " Once in a Lifetime . " <p> On one side we see what appears to be a gun-sight 's target ; on the other , the view from the victim 's fallen camera . The whole installation is noisy and hypernervous . Leave it to the French to come up with such a jaundiced view of our society . <p> You may not even realize Jenny Holzer 's " Lustmord Benches " comprise one of the artworks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word-artist 's wood benches are in the museum 's courtyard , which you do n't enter until you 're ready to leave . A lot of people just sit on them , as they fit in so well with the surroundings . <p> But those who read them will recoil in horror . They have messages like " With you inside me comes the knowledge of my death " and " the color of her when she is inside out is enough to make me kill her . " <p> Holzer says a German magazine reported these vile phrases as having been written on Bosnian war victims . I hope she had some corroborative evidence before using it as the basis for her art - sometimes propaganda gets passed off as truth in war . <p> Like looking away <p> But her work draws a parallel that 's hard to deny - overlooking the " horror " of these benches because we want to sit on them is a form of looking away from the suffering of others . Maybe it 's an unintentional act , but it 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is an imperfect place . <p> " Longing and Belonging : From the Faraway Nearby " is on display through Oct. 8 at two Santa Fe locations , Site Santa Fe warehouse at 1606 Paseo de Peralta and Museum of Fine Arts , 107 W.
