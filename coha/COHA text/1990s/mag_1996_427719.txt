Section : News you can use Colleges in droves want high school seniors to apply early  --  and to agree to come if admitted <p> For decades , high school seniors had the option of applying to college early . Some colleges offered " early action , " while a larger number offered " early decision . " In both cases , students would submit an application to their first-choice school in November and the school would render a verdict by mid-December . But the programs differed significantly : Early action was nonbinding . Early decision required the student to attend the school if accepted . <p> Only those who knew in their hearts where they wanted to spend their undergraduate years took the early-decision path . But in the fall of 1995 , Princeton and Yale abandoned early action for early decision and Stanford instituted early decision . The moves by these blue-ribbon bellwethers turned an option exercised by relatively few into an obsession pursued by tens of thousands . " There 's this fever , this feeding frenzy which just gets bigger and bigger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrenceville School in New Jersey . <p> This new obsessiveness has pushed the college search process back into the junior and sometimes even into the sophomore year , when many students are far from ready to think seriously about college . It also is changing the admission equation at many colleges , affecting not only those applying early but many who take the conventional route . Counselors tell of strong candidates who followed the regular timetable  --  applying in December or January  --  and who were rejected because the college had taken weaker applicants from the same school who applied early . As word gets around , it feeds the frenzy , producing more early applications the following year . <p> An estimated 100,000 high school seniors are believed to have applied under early decision this year . Pennsylvania 's Swarthmore College experienced a 39 percent increase in its early pool ; Yale 's went up 15 percent . Driving these increases is the belief that the early birds are likelier to get the acceptance letters , which will be arriving in many households this week . <p> Although most colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data suggest otherwise . Last year at Princeton , which took almost half of its class from those who applied early , the acceptance rate was 38 percent for the early pool and 8 percent for the regular pool . The University of Pennsylvania is admitting 43 percent from this year 's early pool , almost 20 percent more than it typically takes from its regular pool . <p> Rare candor . Penn and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore are among the few schools that acknowledge that applying early enhances admission prospects . In a September letter to high school counselors , Robert Massa , Hopkins 's dean of enrollment , wrote : " Early decision is less selective ( we admit slightly over half of our ED candidates vs. 36 percent of the regular pool ) . " <p> Equally important , the SAT scores of those admitted early at Hopkins average 10 to 15 points lower than those admitted from the regular pool . At Penn , too , the academic profile of those admitted early tends to be slightly weaker than those admitted from the regular pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students who are equally qualified will have a harder time getting in through regular admission because that pool is more competitive . <p> Many high school counselors fear that so many students are entranced by the odds offered by early decision that not enough are making a considered choice . " Kids see this whole process as a game , and they see early decision as helping them win , " says Ralph Donnell , chair of the guidance department at Clarkstown South High School in West Nyack , N.Y . " But many kids are being hurt . " <p> The harm can take several forms . In the worst case , a student can end up attending a school he or she dislikes . Stephen Singer , director of college placement at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx , N.Y. , believes that a disproportionate share of students unhappy with their college choice applied early . One such student is Maya O'Neil of Portland , Ore. , an 18-year-old freshman at Smith College in Massachusetts . She decided to attend after spending a half day there during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pretty buildings and a charismatic tour guide , " she recalls . O'Neil , unhappy with Smith 's liberal arts emphasis , plans to switch to a technical college . <p> At some institutions , early decision also can lead to a reduction in outright aid . The admission director of a liberal arts college in the Midwest admits , " I am going to be pretty tempted to give you a larger loan or gap you award an aid package that falls short of meeting documented need if I 've already got you under contract . " <p> Duke freshman Jessica Bell believes that happened to her . With a sister already in college , Bell expected that Duke would offer a combination of grants , loans and work-study . As it turned out , her aid package contained only loans and work-study . While Duke denies treating early-decision admits differently , the 18-year-old Milwaukee resident is convinced that if a school has " a student who is not sure of where he or she wants to go , they are going to offer them more . " Guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to apply under early decision . <p> Positive side . For students who truly know where they want to go , however , early decision offers a chance to bring the search to a quick close . Quinn Baker , an 18-year-old high school senior in Highland Park , Texas , visited 11 schools before applying early to Wake Forest . Now admitted , Baker has " one less thing to worry about in my senior year . " <p> But students like Baker , argue many counselors , are better served by the nonbinding early-action option still offered at schools such as Harvard and Georgetown . It lets them apply elsewhere even after being accepted early , giving them time to ponder their decision before the May 1 commitment date set by colleges . <p> By contrast , say most counselors , early decision primarily benefits the colleges . It helps top schools lock up students whom they might otherwise lose to competitors in the April decision scramble . At the same time , it allows schools slightly lower on the academic food chain that may be having difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Some of these schools are even offering financial incentives . Ohio Wesleyan , for example , is providing $4,000 grants to those admitted early . <p> All signs indicate that the mania is likely to continue unabated as more and more schools , including a growing number of public institutions , such as Salisbury State University in Maryland , adopt early-decision programs . The only way to break the momentum is for schools to make clear by their admissions decisions that applying early has no advantages . But in an era when competition for students has never been fiercer , the likelihood of schools moving in that direction is slim  --  or none . DECIPHERING THE TERMS <p> Early this , early that .
