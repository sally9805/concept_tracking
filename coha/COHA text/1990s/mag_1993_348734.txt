IN THE 1980S CHINA 'S REFORMIST LEADERSHIP TRIED to keep top posts in the ruling Communist Party separate from those of the government . That campaign reversed a tradition established by no less a figure than Mao Zedong , who served simultaneously as party chief and head of state from 1954 to 1959 . Now the pendulum seems headed back toward the direction of double dipping  --  and a reconsolidation of official power in party hands . <P> At the close of the 17-day National People 's Congress now under way , Jiang Zemin , 67 , the current party general secretary , is scheduled to become the fifth President of the People 's Republic . Some observers expect that example to spread down the ranks . Coincidentally , when Jiang takes over from retiring Yang Shangkun , 86 , it will mark the first postrevolutionary Chinese government without a single prominent veteran of the famed 1934-35 Long March led by Mao . The passage of time has made that separation at last irreversible .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
