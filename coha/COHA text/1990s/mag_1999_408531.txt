PHILIPS FLAT TV/MONITOR Photograph PHILIPS FLAT TV/MONITOR // Large-format computer monitors mark what could finally be the true convergence between traditional home electronics and the personal computer . You 've probably seen the commercial . Three Gen-Xers move into an apartment about the size of a shoebox , with only an old sofa for furniture . But , according to the accompanying jingle , things are getting better all the time . Why ? Because they happen to have a Philips Flat TV/Monitor , like the one you see pictured on this page . We 're not sure what the message is in that commercial , except that , if you buy a Philips Flat TV/Monitor , you 'll only be able to afford to live in a shoebox . Yes , you 'll shell out plenty if you want a giant monitor for your computer . These things are extravagantly expensive-a whopping $15,000 for the Philips model . Price aside , though , the Philips Flat TV/Monitor and other 42-in. gas-plasma displays like it can handle just about any source you throw at them-computer output , standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two primary markets for super-size monitors-businesses that are looking for just the right display for the boardroom , and individuals who simply insist on having the latest and greatest for their home system , regardless of the price . If you fit one of these categories you 're going to have to choose from two broad groups of large-format monitors : gas - plasma- based units and monitors based on a more traditional picture tube . To help you , we checked out two plasma displays-the Sony Flat Panel Monitor and the Runco Plasma Wall unit . We also looked at three large-format monitors with traditional picture tubes . They are the Princeton AF3.OHD 32-in. all-format monitor , the Mitsubishi XC-2935C 29-in. color monitor and the NEC X 37-in. multimedia monitor . The Plasma Advantage Of the two technologies , gas plasma produces a noticeably superior image . In fact , the word " incredible " comes to mind . You might not notice a big difference when viewing a television program or playing Solitaire on your computer because of the limitations of the output devices . However , strap one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DVD-ROM drive and your jaw is likely to drop to the floor . How can a near-perfect picture be produced in a display only 6 in. deep ? It 's all in the plasma . A gasplasma display is made up of many thousands of pixels . Each one of those pixels is further broken down into three subpixels-one each for red , green and blue ( a k a RGB ) . Advanced electronics are used to produce a specific reaction in the gas plasma , which in turn produces a reaction in the phosphors of each subpixel . The technology is so precise that each pixel is capable of producing any one of over 16 million colors . And of course , the end result is that you get to see movies like you 've never seen them before . One low point , though , is that gas-plasma displays have a hard time with shadow detail , or very dark shades of gray . On the other hand , gas-plasma displays can produce greater contrasts than their CRT counterparts . As for computer output , there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution of 852 x 480 pixels-not bad , but somewhat less than the 1024 x 768 you may be used to from your 17-in. or 20-in. monitor . The Sony unit does have a built-in scan converter , so you can set your video output to higher resolutions . However , you lose some image quality in the translation . Ready For The Future Both the Sony and Runco gasplasma displays can handle any video source now available and Photograph RUNCO PLASMA WALL // any video source likel to become available in the next few years . They have connectors for your computer , plus connectors for anything that might be coming off your home theater system , plus connectors for HDTV input when that format finally reaches the mass market . You might consider your purchase of a gas-plasma display an investment in the future . But by the time you actually need an HDTV-capable display , chances are prices will be drastically lower . Photograph NEC X Photograph MITSUBISHI XC-2935C // Of the traditional displays we looked at , only the Princeton is ready for HDTV . Both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options , such as your computer 's SVGA output and your home theater 's S-Video output . All-In-One Is n't Always Easy Sure , it 's nice to have a display that accepts every imaginable output . However , this apparent convenience brings with it a little extra work at the other end . Most people are used to turning on their personal computers and receiving instant gratification . Ditto with TV . On the other hand , if you have more than one input plugged into your display , you need to cycle through them using the remote every time to get the one you want . The more devices you plug in , the more options you have to consider . This may not seem like a big deal . However , you also have to deal with the issue of aspect ratio . Aspect ratio is the width of a display divided by the height of the display . For example , traditional televisions and computer monitors use an aspect ratio of 1.33 . In other words , the width of the display is 1.33 times its height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.77 , meaning that the display is 1.77 times wider than it is high . All of the gas-plasma displays , as well as the Princeton monitor , provide you with controls to adjust the aspect ratio to match the input . If you have a variety of sources with different optimal aspect ratios , you may find it trouble-some switching this setting again and again . Even when you find the right setting , you may not be thrilled with the results . For example , when you hook your computer up to a gas-plasma display ( whose wide screen was designed with HDTV in mind ) , you 'll have black bars running down each side of the screen because the image simply is n't wide enough to cover the whole area . You can try fiddling with the aspect ratio , but there will always be sacrifices . For example , you can adjust the aspect ratio so your computer image fills the whole screen . But then everything will appear squished . If you choose full-screen , unsquished , the top and bottom of the image are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to image quality , you really ca n't go wrong with any of these monitors . All of these look great , though as a technology , gas plasma produces a better result . And , there are n't many remarkable feature differences among them . All come with handheld remote controls . This is very useful , since you 're not likely to position a monitor of this size within arm 's reach . And all come with onscreen controls so extensive that you should probably avoid fiddling with most of them until you 've really settled in . Common controls include color , tint , contrast and aspect ratio . Others vary from model to model and may include color temperature , chroma and moire clear level . The Sony onscreen display also includes a screen that verifies that the internal temperature of the monitor is okay and that the internal fan is working properly . An interesting feature on the Mitsubishi : The remote includes a degauss button . If your goal is to beef up your computer system now and be ready for HDTV later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton monitor . The image quality of the traditional monitors we looked at is about the best you 'll find in any display that 's based on a traditional picture tube . As mentioned earlier , with gas plasma , you 're limited to 852 x 480 resolution . The Princeton , even with its big screen , is limited to 1024 x 768 . And finally , both the NEC and Mitsubishi offer a full 1600 x 1200 resolution . While the Princeton has built-in speakers , you 're pretty much buying it for ty much display for the display only . Feeling The Power We 'll admit it . Size really does matter . Even if you had to drive only five blocks to work , you 'd rather do it in a Ferrari than a Yugo , right ? The same holds true for monitors . We 'd have a tough time convincing anyone that my computer actually needs a monitor like this-especially the keepers of corporate budgets . But once you get hold of a display this big , it 's hard to let go . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most practical . It can fit in the same space as many televi Photograph PRINCETON AMOND Photograph SONY FLAT PANEL MONITOR // sions and really does n't require that much more space than a 21-in. monitor . At 32 in. and 37 in. respectively , the Princeton and NEC monitors are proportionally larger . However , they 're both about 23 in. deep . The two gas-plasma displays are both about 41 in. by 25 in. , but the Runco is only 3.75 in. deep , compared to the Sony 's 6 in . False feelings of superiority aside , though , what these monitors really give you is flexibility-the ability to do more . Take family computing , for instance . There are lots of computer projects that a family might like to do together . However , even with a 20-in. monitor , considered big for the computer market , it 's kind of tough to get the whole family huddled around the computer . No more . Buy one of these monitors , throw in an infrared keyboard that you can pass from person to person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also delight in these jumbo screens . It 's been shown that the bigger the display , the more difficult it is to play a video game : The objects move faster because they must travel further in the same period of time . For the video-adrenaline junkie , that translates to more excitement and more challenge . Even if your computing is confined to surfing the Web and fiddling with your financial software , these monitors make for an improved user experience . For one thing , because of their size , you need a wide-open space for your monitor and your desk . That in itself makes for a more desirable work atmosphere . And although we know of no studies to support this idea , we would n't be surprised if the extra distance required between you and the monitor due to its size is a good thing for your eyes . If you already have a large monitor , you probably wo n't have to worry about adding extra video RAM . The amount of VRAM you need is determined by the desired resolution and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VRAM that came with your AGP video card is plenty to run any of these at its highest resolution . If you 're considering any of these giant monitors , which one you select depends partly on simple physics . How much room do you have behind your computer ? And how much weight will your work surface support ? Although the gasplasma displays take up the most room , they 're also the lightest . The Runco weighs in at about 86 pounds , while the Sony tips the scale at just over a hundred . The traditional CRTs start at 116 pounds for the Mitsubishi , move up to 143 pounds for the Princeton and max out at a whopping 240 pounds for the NEC . These CRTs may be big and bright , but not everyone wants such a large addition to their home . Gas-plasma monitors are the priciest and require the most wall space , but they 're also lighter and have bigger display areas . Both the Runco and Sony produce the same superior image . Deciding between the two is going to come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote you like better , which has the more intuitive onscreen controls-that sort of thing . If we had to pick , though , it would be the Sony . Of the traditional models , the Princeton , with its HDTV connectors and built-in speakers , is really the most versatile . However , it 's very heavy and at 32 in. , you might have trouble finding a spot for it . The NEC is an excellent monitor , but it 's even bigger and heavier than the Princeton . For the average home user , the Mitsubishi might be the ideal choice . It 's plenty big , but still small enough to fit on a large desk without causing the desk 's legs to buckle . // Sources // The key to a successful purchase is planning . What do you need from a technical standpoint ? In other words , what are you going to plug into this thing and do you have a clue how to do it ? And what are your limitations from a physical standpoint ? Do you have an empty wall ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best bet is to bring this article to your favorite computer store and ask to see each of the models mentioned . One thing 's for sure . There 's a largeformat monitor that 's just right for you-and once you see the big picture , there ai n't no going back . <p>
