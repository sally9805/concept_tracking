HALOGEN LAMPS HAVE LONG BEEN HOT DECORATOR ITEMS . VERY HOT-THEY 'VE STARTED HUNDREDS OF HOUSE FIRES . IF YOU 'RE STILL USING ONE , MAYBE IT 'S TIME TO SAY LIGHTS 0UT . <p> In the late spring of 1947 , Tennessee Williams left New York and took a small beachfront bungalow on Cape Cod , where he put the finishing touches on his new play , A Streetcar Named Desire . As it happened , he spent much of that time at the Cape in the dark , or near-dark , because the electricity in his cabin failed , obliging him to live by candlelight . This circumstance is noteworthy because Williams carried on and the work he created introduced the world to Miss Blanche DuBois , who was not only one of modern drama 's great tragic figures but certainly its most eloquent authority on the subject of lighting . It will be recollected that Blanche , an unwelcome guest in the home of her sister and brother-in-law , the brutish Stanley Kowalski , was so offended by the raw nature of her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two-bedroom French Quarter fiat . She bought a paper lantern . " I ca n't stand a naked lightbulb , " she declared , " any more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action . " Thus did Miss DuBois of Belle Reve gracefully ( and economically ) address an interior design problem that is nearly as old as humankind : the harsh glare of direct lighting . <p> Although Blanche 's paper lantern plainly annoyed Mr. Kowalski and his associates , who kept tipping it down during the play , some other , earlier caveman perfectly understood the wish to attenuate glare . Five hundred thousand or so years ago , a forward-thinking hominid ( probably Peking Man ) solved the glare problem caused by his direct lighting system ( the open fire in his cave ) by inventing the torch . Holding a flaming stick above his head , he bounced light off the ceiling of his cave , bathing his dwelling in a soft , embracing glow  --  the first indirect lighting . <p> Over time , improvements were made , but the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they remained the same . The Middle Ages saw the development of the brazier ( the metal pan atop a torch that holds the flaming material , a la Lady Liberty ) ; gaslight was introduced in the late 18th century ; and in x879 Thomas Edison invented the electric incandescent lamp  --  the familiar electric lightbulb that has illuminated our time . Edison 's lightbulb , as Williams illustrated in Streetcar , suffers the inherent handicap of direct-light glare , and Blanche 's lamp-shade solution , while reducing glare , has the inescapable effect of dimming the light . But at least with Edison 's lightbulb , mankind had finally achieved the happy state of safe , flame-free illumination . <p> And then along came the halogen . <p> The halogen is a technical twist on Edison 's incandescent bulb , an engineering miracle that produced a bulb that is small , lasts forever and throws off light in greater amounts than that created by an incandescent bulb . Perhaps not since the torch first lit up the caves of Choukoutien has a new lighting type been so enthusiastically embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotta light , for cheap , " explains Michael Siminovitch , project head of the Lighting Lab at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley , California . And perhaps not since the torch has a lighting device posed such a household hazard . " They 're a tremendous light , they 're effective lights , but they 're very dangerous , " says John O'Brien , a fire marshal for the New York City Bureau of Fire Investigation . <p> O'Brien is the man whose job it was in January 1997 to pick his way through the smoldering heap that had been the Lincoln Towers home of the iconic jazz vibraphonist Lionel Hampton , and to deduce the cause of one of the most spectacular Manhattan high-rise fires in recent memory . " It was up in that high tower , looking down into Avery Fisher Hall , " O'Brien recalls . " Completely gutted . There was steam rising - a lot of times you 'll see steam coming out of a radiator ; the building does n't know there was a fire . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Hampton 's bedroom , the wall had failed . All of his vibraphones were completely destroyed . Completely . And the medals that were bestowed on him by presidents  --  presidents ! And I was walking through the scene , digging them out of the rubble . And the very next day , he was going to Washington to get another award , and he had no clothing . He had this one xylophone , and all that was left of it was keys on the floor , and some of them were contorted and bent , partially melted . You know , this was a very intense fire . " O'Brien and his colleagues traced the blaze to a halogen lamp in Hampton 's bedroom that had tipped over , igniting a bedspread . <p> The Hampton fire , occurring as it did in the neighborhood the national television networks , drew a lot of attention , but it was not the first halogen disaster to strike a famous residence . In November 1992 , Charles , the Prince of Wales , was driving along a highway west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific fire several miles distant , which turned out to be the burning of Windsor Castle . By the time the fire was extinguished 15 hours later ( after a drenching by almost 2 million gallons of water ) , the great castle , whose construction was begun by William the Conqueror , had lost a chapel , two rooms and its famous St. George 's banqueting Hall . Investigators determined that the fire was started by a halogen lamp in the private chapel , which ignited a nearby curtain . <p> The trouble with halogens is the very thing that makes them such a great light : They give off so much light only because they get so hot . A piece of paper will burst into flame when subjected to a temperature of 450 degrees ( F. ) , wood will combust at 375 to 510 degrees , and cotton at 511 degrees ; the surface of a heated halogen bulb ( as anyone who 's touched one can attest ) reaches 1,000 degrees at the surface , and can get even hotter , depending on the wattage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials began tracking halogen fires and to issue warnings about the lights . The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 's latest tally is rather alarming : Since 1992 there have been 232 fires and 12 deaths , and that 's just tracking one type of halogen fixture , the floor lamp . College administrators from Harvard to the University of North Texas have banned halogen lamps from campus dormitories . A New York State official warned the public off halogens by calling them " open fires in our homes . " <p> The halogen came into the world benignly enough when , in the early 1950s , engineers at the General Electric Lighting World Headquarters in Cleveland were trying to figure a way to build a tiny , powerful new light that could fit inside the wingtips of supersonic jets . At first , they tried powering up conventional incandescent bulbs , which quickly burned out . Eventually , the researchers hit upon the idea of the halogen , which was actually a reworking of the incandescent bulb . <p> Edison 's bulb works by passing electrical power through a metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off light . A bulb goes out when the filament breaks , which is what happens when it overheats or wears down . The G.E . engineers found that by filling the bulbs with a reactive element , or halogen , the resultant gas combined with the burned-off particles of the tungsten filament and carried them back to the bulb 's core , thus replenishing the filament even as the bulb burned . It was a weird , and fortuitous , chemical ecology that made a dream lightbulb , a self-renewing device that burned hotter and longer , and gave off a remarkably bright white light . <p> That was 1954 . The new halogen light proved perfect for the ultrathin wings of SSTs ( supersonic transports ) , and G.E . began to look for other applications for the light . They installed halogens at a Cleveland high school football field , and in 1958 , the company began selling halogens commercially . The lights found an eager market in such places as movie and television studios , and today hardly a studio lamp can be found that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry McGowan put it , the halogen is " a great little technology . " <p> And that was its reputation for most of 30 years . By the late 1970s , however , European interior designers began to use the halogen for home lighting , and the trend caught on in America soon thereafter . The early halogen home lamps tended to be high-end decorator items , such as the Tizio , priced at $200 or more , but market forces took over , Asian manufacturers got into the game , and by the mid ' 90s , a high-powered household halogen lamp could be had for less than $20 at any Home Depot . <p> Suddenly , it seemed that hardly a home lacked a halogen , and the halogen that is in the most homes and offices is a lamp called the torchiere . With more than 4o million of them out there , it is the Typhoid Mary of lighting . <p> This amazingly popular floor lamp might have been more aptly named L'Arson , but torchiere ( suggesting , as it does , a torch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base at the bottom and a bowl cradling a light at the top . This design is what gives the lamp its principal charm , which is indirect lighting . The upward-facing bowl bounces light off the ceiling , and because it is a halogen light , one lamp can light up a room without glare . It is extremely portable , and with mass production and mass marketing , extremely affordable . " It was a magic combination of elements : indirect , low-cost , lots of light , highly portable , " says Michael Siminovich of Lawrence Berkeley Labs . But the halogen torchiere is fire on a stick . <p> General Electric created and manufactures halogen bulbs , but not the fixtures that hold them , and G.E . ' s McGowan says that from the start , G.E . recognized the potential danger from halogens and encouraged lamp manufacturers to hide the hot bulb with a protective glass covering . This precaution was followed nearly uniformly for more than 3o years , McGowan says , adding that it was only more recently with the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started hearing complaints about fires and other problems . " <p> How does an unsafe halogen cause fires and other problems ? Let us count the ways . McGowan notes that halogens contain pressurized gas , so if the lamp is damaged , that pressure forces the parts to fly around . In other words , the thing can explode . When John O'Brien of the New York Bureau of Fire Investigation first encountered a halogen bulb , he was in the military . " I found out early in the ' 70s that if you touch the bulb , the oils from your skin will adhere to the bulb surface , and what happens is because of the intense heat , the heat concentrates around the oils of the fingers and bursts the bulb , " O'Brien says . ' When they heat up , they explode . They 've gone the width and length of rooms and burned people and started fires . " <p> It quickly becomes apparent that torchieres , with their open bowls , present a multitude of incendiary possibilities . The brushing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ) is probably the most common cause of fire , but the variations are limitless . A student at Texas A &; M University started a dorm fire by trying to dry his clothes over his halogen torchiere . Toddlers have been known to toss stuffed toys or socks into the lamp 's bowl ( which does present a certain beanbag-toss allure ) . But most halogen fires result from the most mundane , even innocent , heedlessness . Inspector George Hannigan , an investigator for the Greenwich , Connecticut , Fire Department , recalls investigating one fire caused by a designer halogen that was used to illuminate the artwork in someone 's home  --  which , as it turns out , is not an uncommon use of the light . " The halogen was in a floor fixture , which was nothing more than a metal can with three feet on it , " Hannigan says . " It was set on carpeting on the floor next to the arm of the couch . And the cleaning lady had left a rag there , and the daughter came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do her homework . When she came down , the living room was on fire . " <p> Last summer , during a seminar at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia , Inspector Hannigan conducted an experiment with a halogen lamp just to see for himself what the thing could do , a sort of fireguy 's road test . " I took a T-shirt that was beyond damp , it was downright wet , " he says , " and I brought that in contact with a 300-watt torchiere lamp with a halogen bulb . It ignited in 30 seconds . That might give you some idea of the magnitude of the heat that 's produced . And that was a 3oo-watt light . You can get them up to 1,000 watts . " <p> The impulse to personally test the incendiary qualities of a halogen is apparently neither uncommon among people with halogen-fire experience , nor particular to those in the firefighting profession . For example , Pat Buckley , the fashionable society figure , recently found herself probing the ignition potential of a halogen lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , I do n't know , $49.95 , or something like that , and I shone it on some paper 16 inches away , " she recalls . " And inside of 20 minutes , the paper was crisp . And inside of 25 minutes , it was aflame . " <p> What excited Mrs. Buckley 's interest in halogens were the events of a November morning last year , when the gardener at the Buckleys ' Stamford , Connecticut , home noticed that the windows of the stucco house were blowing out of their frames , pushed by a raging fire . The family happened to be in New York , where Mrs. Buckley was preparing for a party , but a member of the staff who stayed behind had apparently left a halogen lamp on in a sitting room , its intense light trained on a newspaper . Within 15 minutes , the entire room was on fire , Mrs. Buckley recounts . " We 'd had a power outage the night before , and he had forgotten to reset the alarm system . And bingo . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> By late spring , Chez Buckley was fully renewed and in order , but the fire 's impact lingers . " Everything 's repainted , " she says , " but you have that eerie , terrible smoke smell . And it will be here for the rest of my life . I rush about with a great deal of Lysol spray . " <p> It is probably safe to number Mrs. Buckley among those who consider halogen lamps unsafe at any speed . But those charged with proving such matters have not always been able to agree on the extent of the halogen threat . In 1996 , as reports about halogen-related fires began to accumulate , the Underwriters Laboratories issued a public warning urging consumers to replace their 500 watt halogens with 3oo-watt bulbs . Consumers Union , however , declared that was n't precaution enough after conducting tests with a 300-watt bulb and finding that it set a cotton comforter ablaze after just a few minutes . UL issued a bulletin to manufacturers saying they would only endorse lamps using 3oo-watt bulbs , and only if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered with a declaration that such precautions were still insufficient ; they discovered that a 3oo-watt halogen equipped with a glass cover burned a hole in cheesecloth . <p> In February 1997 , UL again revised its standards , saying that it would lend its seal only to halogens that did not light cheesecloth after direct contact for seven hours . That may reassure purchasers of the very latest , very safest halogens ( especially if they have cheesecloth comforters ) , but the array of charges and changing standards has been , to say the least , confounding not only to consumers , but to manufacturers as well . <p> When the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission decided a few years ago that action was needed on the matter of halogen safety , it contacted the Catalina Lighting Inc. , a Miami-based lamp manufacturer that so dominates the halogen market , it serves as a sort of one-company industry association . Dean Rappaport , Catalina 's chief of operations , says his company has sold millions of halogens , and yet he was n't aware of any significant problems with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconvinced that there is a halogen emergency . " In the last ten years , there were 40 million halogen torchieres built for U.S. consumption , and there have been 250 fires over those ten years , " he says . ' " We all feel bad about those 25 degrees , but the numbers are negligible . " <p> Rappaport insists that halogen torchieres are perfectly safe , as long as they are accorded the same care one would show for a stove or a toaster oven . In an acknowledgment that most people do not categorize lamps with ovens , the company recognized the need to do more to ensure safety . So , Catalina devised and distributed ( without cost to consumers ) a one-size-fits-all metal grid that fastens over the bulb and prevents fires  --  absolutely , positively , guaranteed . Almost . " Now , if you had some kind of crazy flammable material making up your curtain , it might still cause a problem , " Rappaport allows . ' " We could only do our best . " <p> Catalina says it 's developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective grid but a thermal protector , a device that turns off the lamp when it gets too hot . And others are attempting to provide safer halogen-quality lighting as well . <p> Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory not long ago introduced a Compact Fluorescent torchiere that creates more light than a halogen torchiere but is six times as efficient . And , because it is a fluorescent , the bulb does n't get hot ( about 100 degrees F at its surface ) . The Berkeley Lab and Stanford University ran a successful halogen-exchange program , handing out free Compact Fluorescent torchieres to every student who turned in his or her halogen . Berkeley researcher , Michael Siminovich , insists that the students love their new lamps , and perhaps they do , but a fluorescent light ? Do n't students consider harsh , bleachy fluorescents dorky ? " That 's technically correct , " Siminovich says , hastening to add , " but the new ones are technically superior . " <p> Several companies are , or plan to start , producing torchieres using the new fluorescent technology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plans to introduce a Compact Fluorescent torchiere in the fall . The quality , says G.E . ' s McGowan , is fully the equal of a halogen . So good , in fact , that he boldly declares : " No question about it , 100-percent guaranteed , you can look good under fluorescent lighting . " <p> No doubt the new lamps will one day become de rigueur , but until then , there are still millions of halogens out there , many of them manufactured before the latest standards were announced . The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has the power to enforce the tough standards on makers of new lamps , but what about those manufactured before 1977 " I 'm not sure how we would go after them , " allows the commission 's Ken Giles . <p> Giles notes that at the commission 's urgent prompting , the lamp manufacturing industry has made protective wire grates available , without charge , to all halogen torchiere lamp owners through a number of retail merchandisers . " You have to downsize to a 3oo-watt bulb and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and then you may then use your halogen light safely . " <p> Or , maybe not . New York State Fire Administrator James Burns has noted that there is still the problem of halogen lamp 's tip-over potential . " Our tests showed that it required only x7 ounces of force " to topple a torchiere , Burns said , and he urges consumers with halogen torchieres to bolt the lamp to the floor . Even with a powered down , glass-encased , metal-grated , bolted-down torchiere , the New York Halogen Torchiere Safety Fact Sheet urges extreme caution that stops just short of a zero-tolerance halogen policy . " We urgently call upon families , friends and neighbors , as well as religious leaders and family counselors to help everyone fully understand how dangerous halogen lamps are , " the report implores . <p> Some may yet have to learn that message the hard way . One of the oddest sites on the Web , a milieu of exotica , is a page called The Cult of the Lamp , whose pages are devoted to a certain deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Arielle , is a shrine to the halogen torchiere . While the site offers a page providing visitors with news of the latest scary development , it cheerfully invites admirers of the baneful appliance to submit photographs of themselves and their loved ones posing with their lamps . And they do . The curious will find photographs of Arielle and her husband ( boyfriend ? ) , the barefooted Shawn , and Mickie and Matt Gelyen posing in Halloween garb next to their halogen , and Becky and Jimi in poses with both of their torchieres , including the one they sawed off so it works on a night table . <p> It is impossible to gauge the breadth of this nonchalance toward danger , but college students at the universities where halogen lamps have been banned have been known to stash them in their closets and to bring them out for use when the coast is clear . And , astonishingly , some people continue to drape material over the light , for mood . <p> " I 've been in apartments where people have taken shawls or kerchiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , " says Fire Marshal O'Brien of the New York Bureau of Fire Investigation . And the likeliest effect of fabric on a 1,000-degree surface ? " Oh , you could expect a very hot time , " says O'Brien . <p> Not the kind of time that may have appealed to the belle of Belle Reve , but to that sort that ends in smoldering mementos and narrow escapes , if one is lucky . And then comes the abiding aroma of Lysol spray  --  a culmination even less welcome than a rude gesture , or a vulgar remark . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Peter J. Boyer <p>
