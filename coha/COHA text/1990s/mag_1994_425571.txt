<p> Getting the most from your workout means bringing more than just your muscles into play  --  and boosting your brain power just might mean getting physical . <p> " PRETEND YOUR ARMS ARE MEAT HOOKS . " <p> What ? <p> " Pretend your arms are meat hooks , " my workout partner repeats . I 've got 110 pounds of iron suspended in front of me , my muscles are screaming for mercy , and this guy wants me to make believe I 'm the bad guy in Peter Pan ? <p> " You 're cheating  --  you 're using your forearm muscles to pull the lat bar down , " he says . <p> Oh . <p> " If you think of your arms as hooks , that 'll keep your wrists straight and you 'll use your back muscles instead . " <p> He 's right . With this little mind game , I 'm able to relax my arms and let the muscles of my back pull the bar down to my chest . The effort goes where I want it to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workout . <p> Unbeknownst to me , I 've just engaged in a tactic called imagery , using the creative powers of my mind to enhance my exercise routine . <p> More and more , researchers are beginning to take notice of the role that the mind plays in exercise  --  as well as the role that exercise plays in enhancing the mind . Getting the most from your workout , it seems , means bringing more than just your muscles into play . <p> In fact , there are plenty of ways to engage your brain at the same time you engage your body . Simple mind games , motivation tactics and relaxation techniques can help a guy stick to , and get more from , his workout . <p> And no , we 're not going to get all weird and New Agey on you  --  no stuffing crystals down your jockstrap , no pyramid hats . The techniques that follow are simple and effective , designed for the average guy who simply wants to get the most that he can from exercise . The Mind/Body Connection <p> RESEARCHERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainpower and creativity . " For some people , the creative thinking that occurs during and after exercise is quite pronounced , " says Kenneth Callen , M.D. , an associate professor of psychiatry at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland . In one study , Joan Gondola , Ph.D. , of Baruch College of the City University of New York found that students who participated in aerobic fitness and dance classes were able to think of more uses for an ordinary object , such as a pencil , than those who did n't participate in aerobics . <p> Why the increase in original ideas during exercise ? Some experts believe that exercise increases oxygen flow to the brain . " As you become aerobically trained , the body becomes more efficient at transporting and utilizing oxygen , " says Robert Dustman , Ph.D. , a researcher at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salt Lake City . Other researchers speculate that exercise triggers the release of hormones that enhance creativity . Some even theorize that aerobic exercise may suppress activity in the left hemisphere of the brain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right hemisphere , which regulates intuition and creativity . <p> All this is great news , but what does that mean to our biceps and our waistlines ? Plenty . In fact , creativity and imagination can work wonders on your workout  --  if you know how to use them right . Drive yourself with distraction . One of the most effective mental techniques available to athletes  --  and the rest of us  --  is a strategy called dissociation . It 's essentially a form of controlled daydreaming , consciously directing your mind away from the task at hand and on to more pleasant thoughts . The result is a more enjoyable workout , a less boring workout  --  in short , a workout that you 'll look forward to instead of dreading . Researchers at Smith College studied the effects of dissociation on exercise in women . Student subjects cycled for 15 minutes while their heart rates were monitored . Some were asked to concentrate strictly on their exertion levels during the exercise ; others were asked to try to remember the names of every teacher they 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both groups , those who were busy conjuring up schoolmarms of yore rated their level of exertion as significantly less than their self-focusing peers did . And while these test subjects were women , researchers say that dissociation tactics work as well in men . Exercise your mind first . The technique is called visualization . When you imagine yourself exercising before you actually begin working out , you get tangible , muscle-building benefits as well as better performance . In one study , subjects were asked to use three different mental strategies to prepare for a grip-strength test . One strategy consisted of psyching themselves up by getting mad or pumped up . Another was visualizing themselves squeezing the grip-strength meter as hard as they could . The third was counting backward out loud from 20 . Those who visualized themselves squeezing the meter did far better on the test than those who prepared by using the other methods . <p> There 's evidence that this type of mental preparation may have some direct impact on the nerves , effectively " priming " the muscles needed for a specific task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biceps of test subjects who simply envisioned flexing the muscles , says Diana McNab , M.Ed. , an assistant professor of sports psychology at Seton Hall University . ( Some exercise therapists use this imagery tactic on patients recovering from surgery . Even though they ca n't , say , perform a situp , if they imagine themselves performing one , they 'll get a slight muscular contraction that will encourage recovery . ) <p> Give yourself an imaginary helping hand . Any psychological ploy to make your task seem easier than it is can improve performance . In his Winning Guide to Sports Endurance , triathlete Scott Tinley notes that seven-time World Professional Marathon Swimming champion Paul Asmuth sometimes imagined he had something attached to his head that was pulling him through the water . This kind of positive thinking can help anyone perform better . For example , McNab recommends that a way to squeeze out a few more crunches in a routine exercise plan is to envision a string connecting your navel to your spine . As you curl up , imagine that string pulling down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That image will help you get a fuller contraction , " she says . ( Picture the string around your waist and pulling you as you run or cycle uphill . ) <p> Help comes in different forms for different people , of course . If you need some inspiration to complete that 3-mile run , turn your last laps around the high-school track into the final stretch of the Boston Marathon , the crowd cheering as you close in fast on the leader . <p> It may also help to ease up once in a while . " You do n't have to be in a competitive mood all the time , " says sports psychologist Michael Sachs , Ph.D. , an associate professor of physical education at Temple University . " Remember to relax and enjoy your workout . " Focus on form . Sometimes it 's hard to let your mind go , especially when it starts to wander toward things you do n't want to think about your mortgage payments , for example , or that weasel in promotions who keeps claiming credit for your ideas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind away from your exertion level , so think positively and focus it instead on your form . Some examples from Tinley : Keep your stride long , turn your pedals in a circle , pull all the way through with your swimming stroke , make your bench press slow and even . " You 'll find those niggling doubts and fears melting away as you concentrate on the mechanics of your efforts , " he says . Live in a dream world . If you still doubt that subconscious thought and performance are linked , we have news for you . In a study of master track and field athletes , researchers in Arkansas and Oregon found that those who dreamed about competition , particularly those who dreamed of success , tended to report faster personal times for some events . Even if you 're not a competitive athlete , go to bed with exercise on your mind , and you may just sleep your way to a better workout . The Body/Mind Connection <p> JUST GETTING TO THE GYM IS MORE than half the battle . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your attention , skipping a workout is often the easiest thing to do . What you need is a dose of motivation . <p> But here 's a secret : Motivation is inextricably bound with self-esteem . To keep on coming back to the gym , you 've got to put value you 're accomplishing  --  that is , taking care of yourself . A study last year from Texas Tech University rated the self-esteem levels of 31 people with sports- or job-related injuries whose rehabilitation included physical therapy . Researchers found that those who ranked low in self-esteem were the same people who skipped or canceled the most therapy appointments . <p> On the other hand , regular exercise has been shown to build self-esteem and fight depression , possibly by speeding more oxygen to the brain . " You get more circulation to the brain , so you 're more likely to have normal recall instead of getting bogged down in unpleasant memories , " explains Robert S. Brown , Sr. , M.D. , Ph.D. , clinical professor of psychiatric medicine at the University of Virginia . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial in getting you to work out . Well , do n't fear . Here are some simple mental tricks that can improve your outlook  --  and your exercise habits . <p> Get S.M.A.R.T . The key to maintaining any fitness regimen is to set reasonable goals for yourself . If you start out with the objective to get in the best shape of your life in six weeks , guess what , fella  --  you 're not going to make it . Focus your goals on performance rather than winning and frame them in positive terms . Sachs recommends you use the acronym S.M.A.R.T . and set goals that are : <p> Specific : You want to set a certain pace , run for a certain period of time , lift a set amount of weight  --  some-thing you can determine that you 've accomplished . <p> Measurable : You should be able to show proof of your progress , be it with a watch or set of weight plates . <p> Attainable : A goal that a sensible workout program should put within your reach  --  not so difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're bored . <p> Realistic : Before you decide where you want to go , make sure you 've made a reasonable assessment of where you are . If you know you can only get to the gym three times a week , be sure your goal is attainable with that level of exercise . <p> Time-bound : Set a specific time frame for reaching your goal . Get creative in monitoring your progress . Most any book on exercise you pick up will tell you to keep a log as a motivation tool . If you 're the diary-writing sort , fine . If not , try some more-creative tactics . Let 's say you 're planning on running 3 miles a day three times a week . Get a map of your state , draw a line across it , and trace 9 miles along the line for each week you meet your goal . You should make it across the widest part of New Jersey in less than eight weeks . Before long , you 'll be on your way to navigating the whole country . Bank on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each day after you finish , toss a penny or a nickel ( or more if you 're so inclined ) into a jar or bowl . As weeks go by , you 'll see ever-increasing evidence of the progress you 've already made . Take some affirmative action . Affirmations have nothing to do with joining a religious cult or contacting your inner child . They 're simple phrases or words you can repeat to yourself whenever you feel a funk coming on . Thinking about skipping today 's workout ? The minute the thought crosses your mind , simply say to yourself , " Stop . " Take a deep breath . Now refocus your thoughts in a positive light : " I 'm on the road to fitness . I want to stay there . " Remember you 'll feel better if you exercise . In one study , researchers asked subjects suffering from depression to memorize a list of words such as " pretty " and " ugly . " Then 90 minutes later , they asked the subjects to recall all the words . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same depressed folks participated in an aerobics class , the memorization drill was repeated . This time , there was a significant upsurge in the number of positive terms recalled . Take up a demanding sport . In a study conducted by Dr. Brown , student athletes at the University of Virginia were given mood evaluation tests at the beginning and end of their sport seasons . Re-suit : Those who participated in high-energy sports such as basketball and wrestling showed a greater improvement in mood than those who participated in low-intensity sports such as golf . <p> But even challenging sports can get old if they 're all you do . If you want the psychological lift that exercise can deliver , do n't get stuck in a rut . On one level , this means if you do n't enjoy biking , do n't bike . Take up racquetball , swimming , weight training , whatever . Look for a sport that fulfills your emotional needs as well as your physical ones . On another level , it also means breaking up even the sports you do like with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of change  --  different workouts not only challenge different muscles , but they may stimulate different parts of the brain . The Body/Stress Connection <p> HIGH-TENSION LIVING HAS been linked to everything from cardiovascular diseases to immune dysfunction . Yet exercise seems to keep some of these problems at bay . A study done with the Honolulu Heart Program has found , for example , that among older men who lead active lifestyles , the incidence of stroke was about one third of that for inactive men . <p> Why exactly do men find stress relief from exercise ? One theory suggests that exercise triggers the release of brain chemicals , such as endorphins , that have a positive effect on mood . <p> In a study at Ohio State University , students who participated in aerobics three times a week not only improved their fitness , but also significantly lowered their test anxiety levels in less than two months . In another study , researchers in Kansas found that men who jogged at least 20 minutes a day three times a week were less anxious and expressed less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good , not only for your mind , but for your body as well . Ask any member of the Buffalo Bills about how too much stress can affect athletic performance . After he 's finished wiping the floor with you , he 'll probably tell you that when your mind is stressed out , your body is prone to making mistakes . This is not something you want , especially if you 're going to be bench-pressing your weight this afternoon . Take your meditation . Meditating for as little as 20 minutes twice a day can be remarkably effective in improving general well-being , according to some experts . It can also help you get more from your workout , since a relaxed body performs better than a tense one . If you 're not one for meditation , three-time Ironman World Series champion Tinley recommends a practical alternative . Before , say , a session of weight training , find a spot where you can be alone , close your eyes briefly and see yourself moving through the exercise . " The idea is to calm yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motions , maintaining your form and exhaling with each repetition . Hop on the table . Athletes in every sport , from three-time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond to horsehoe pitcher George Bush , rely on massage , notes Tinley . Anyone who trains regularly subjects muscle and mind to substantial strain . Physically , massage reduces muscle tightness , aids circulation and relieves soreness . Mentally , the soothing salve of massage eases tension  --  and where a soothed mind leads , rigid muscles often follow . <p> " On the massage table , you learn how it feels to be relaxed , " says Bob McAtee , a Colorado Springs massage therapist who works extensively with athletes . " If you carry that feeling of relaxation over into training  --  remember what it 's like for your shoulders to be relaxed , your legs to be relaxed  --  you 're much more likely to perform better . " <p> No time to book the services of a massage therapist ? Self-massage can be a valuable addition to your training routine  --  and you can reap the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says McAtee . Some pointers for the neophyte : First , use large , vigorous strokes along the length of the entire muscle . Large strokes might include rolling , kneading or long , gliding strokes . To help circulation , direct these strokes toward the heart . Follow these with smaller strokes , working across the grain of the muscle to help separate and relax the muscle fibers . If you encounter pain , leave it be . " There 's good pain and there 's bad pain . Massage can relieve good pain , such as muscle soreness . But bad pain means you 're working too deeply , or working on something that should n't be massaged . If it 's painful , stop , " advises McAtee . Stretch your mind as well as your body . " Every athlete performs better when relaxed , " says Bob Anderson , a runner and cyclist and author of the book Stretching . And , he says , incorporating regular stretching sessions into your training routine is one of the most effective ways tO teach your mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to relax physically and mentally during your stretches . Unfortunately , most of us who do bother with stretching rush through it briefly before breaking into a jog or jumping on the bike , If you ca n't fit a relaxed stretching session into your daily routine , pick a relaxed time during your day to stretch  --  say , right before Home Improvement . As long as you stretch slowly and gently and remember to focus on the feel of the stretch , you can do this any time without warming up first , says Anderson . Here are a few quick tips to remember : Slow and steady . Never bounce , and never stretch to the point where you feel pain . Avoid stretches that use your body weight to stretch a muscle  --  the old standard toe touch , for example . Throwing your body weight behind a stretch may force you to go beyond your natural limit , and presto , you 're injured . Hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds to allow time for the body to relax . Do n't buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerciser ? You can still blow off stress with a brisk 20-minute walk , says David Roth , Ph.D. , associate professor of psychology at the University of Alabama in Birmingham . " The one-shot exercise session does appear to have antianxiety effects , " he says . That 's not to say that an occasional walk is a substitute for a regular exercise program . Expect the relaxing effects of that walk to last about an hour . <p> PHOTOS : A man jogging and stretching on a mountain . <p> By Stephen Perrine <p> WINNING THE MIND GAME 5 mental strategies to give you the edge  --  in the gym , on the field , at the office PROLONG YOUR WORKOUT . When you 're in the middle of a run , bike ride or rowing exercise and you feel like hanging it up , take a deep breath and blow out hard and loud . This mind-clearing technique is known in competitive circles as the " explosive exhale . " It allows you to " blow out all your demons , " says Amby Burfoot , former Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TALLER . For better posture , imagine there 's a string attached to the top of your head , pulling you toward the sky . This mental trick is used a great deal by runners , bicyclists and weight lifters , but it works in everyday life , too  --  not a bad idea for the man who wants to look impressive walking into that big business meeting . DO N'T BLOW YOUR LEAD . To keep yourself from making a mistake at a key moment in any sport , be it tennis , golf , baseball or horseshoes , break the game down into its smallest components . When your mind is locked on the mechanics of racket angle , body position and trajectory , the pressure ca n't get to you . PERFECT YOUR FORM . Olympic marathoner Frank Shorter imagines his legs are bike wheels . The result is a smooth , steady pace and champion-ship-caliber form . In the gym , imagine the barbell you 're working with is sliding on a track . This keeps your mind on proper form , and will keep you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur As he used to place a note under the umpire 's chair that said " Move your feet . " Little reminders like that can keep us from forgetting the fundamentals when the pressure 's on  --  whether it 's on the tennis court or in the big meeting . <p> DO N'T LOSE YOUR BALANCE Cross-training for real life  --  how to bridge the gap between work and working out <p> Balance . It 's the catch phrase of the 1990s , a term that applies to a lot of things  --  career excellence and family responsibility , strong mind and healthy body . We all want it . We just need to know how to find it . <p> One way is to treat your off-hours as differently from your work hours as possible . " We need to think of exercise as a kind of cross-training for modern life , " says Diana McNab , M.Ed. , an assistant professor of sports psychology at Seton Hall University . " People are working longer and harder for less money . We need to use exercise to balance out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work revolves around ideas , presentations and creative thinking , you need to balance out all that free-form thinking with a little structure . Look for focused , goal-oriented types of exercise : timed runs , exercise machines with set tasks or levels of difficulty , competitive sports , or weight-lifting programs with specific goals . <p> On the other hand , if you 're a bottom-line , hard-facts-and-figures type , there 's probably not a lot of creative interaction in your workday , so when you get to the gym , you need to break free . McNab recommends group activities like running , in-line skating or aerobics classes , working out with a friend or personal trainer , or engaging in noncompetitive sports like kayaking or rock climbing . " Anything that 's fun , playful and social will help balance out your day , " she says . <p>
