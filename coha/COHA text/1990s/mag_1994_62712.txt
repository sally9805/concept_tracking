CALLER ? CALLER ? Can you turn down your radio ? // Good . Now , can you hang up that phone ? // Good . Now , I 've got something to say . I quit . I ca n't go on . I 've had to fill four hours of airtime a day , five days a week , talking about sports . This station fills 24 hours a day , seven days a week , talking about sports . We have beaten every issue into hotel-ashtray sand , yet we will talk about this stuff again next week . If one more person asks me if I think Tonya Harding did it , I am going to get his address , drive calmly to his house and remove his larynx with a ball retriever . // Do n't you sec ? It is all bullspit . I do n't know any more than you . I have the newspaper in front of me , same as you . A lot of the people in my line of work were second-string punt-coverage guys and country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credentialed to the International Darts Festival . You ask me , " Do you think Tonya Harding did it ? " And , just once , I would like to say , " I do n't have a clue . I 'm not within a toll call of a clue on that . I 've never spoken to Tonya Harding or even overhauled a transmission with her . You might as well ask me if I know any really great lunch spots in Gdansk . " But just the same , I give you 13 minutes of prattle . Hey , I 've got four hours to fill here . // The truth is , America is getting a B.S. degree in sports , and the b.s. part is spilling in through your car radio and out from under your big-screen TV . A nation that was once full of doers is now a nation full of dialers. // Three years ago there were a fistful of all-sports radio stations in the U.S. Now there are 78 . There were only a few sports-roundtable TV shows . Now nearly every big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It has gotten this sick : You can even participate in a live call-in sports show while you are on an airplane. // And passengers on the left side of the cabin will notice the Grand Can  --  I 'm on the air ? The Phillies suck ! // " We have become a land of b.s. and sound bites , " says CBS basketball analyst Billy Packer . " It 's all diarrhea of the mouth . " // This sports talk is doing bad things . Take three sportswriter friends of mine . Ordinarily you could spray WD-40 on their appetizers and they would n't arch an eyebrow . Yet whenever they appeared on a roundtable segment of ESPN 's NFL Prime Monday last fall , they all became Morton Downey Jr. , yelling , sneering and calling people names . What matters is not the most-considered opinion . What matters is the loudest opinion . Or , better yet , the last opinion before the beer ad. // On the Information Superhighway the only sure way to keep from winding up as roadkill is to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New McCarthyism . The Everybody Here in the Studio Is Cool and Everybody Else Is a Jerk school of broadcasting . // " It has distorted all of the things that we should be getting out of sports , " says Penn State football coach Joe Paterno . " Nobody ever wins a game anymore ; somebody else blew it . " // And it does n't matter who gets ripped , as long us somebody gets ripped . A talk-show host friend of mine calls me up every once in a while and says , " Give me something to rip him with today . " // " Something to rip who with ? " // " Whoever . " // Do you really think you 're getting inside stuff from guys like us ? Four years ago in Tuscaloosa , Ala. , some radio talk-show hosts crawled all over Alabama football coach Bill Curry , insisting that Auburn had whipped his butt in recruiting . Before long , discontented Alabama alumni , further incensed by what they were hearing on the radio , finally got Curry fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national championship . // In many cases the stations with sports talk shows also own the rights to broadcast the games of local teams , which means the stations could lose big bucks if Joe Talkshowhost makes Charlie Generalmanager angry . At one Los Angeles radio station this memo was distributed to on-air talent : " A reminder to be ' friendly ' to our local teams , especially our flagships . There should be no bad-mouthing of these teams and if a caller or guest instigates such talk ... our talk-show hosts ... should carefully change the subject or move on to something else . " // But forget the hosts for a minute . Have you ever met any of the callers ? Most of these guys spend their days holding down couch springs . Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino says they 're " basically frustrated at home , ca n't get a date , do n't do well at their jobs and are basically at the nadir of their lives . " In other words , if things got any worse for them , they would host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new policy , " Packer says . " When I 'm on a show and I get asked about a player I have n't seen yet , I just say , ' Sorry , I really do n't have the background to answer that question . " " // Sounds like a movement . Now I have to get all the other hosts and all their guests and all the callers to agree . Then I would really be doing something to clean up the air .
