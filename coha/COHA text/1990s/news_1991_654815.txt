<p> ' NEW Jack City " paints a grim portrait of drugs and violence in the inner city , and violence has erupted outside a few theaters where the film opened . Did the film inspire those acts of violence ? The film 's director , Mario Van Peebles , says no . Rev. Leon Kelly , a Pentecostal minister in Denver who works with gang kids , agrees . <p> Mr. Kelly 's work has taken him to the theater to watch the same films " his kids " see , and to interpret the movies through their eyes . Still , Kelly , like many others , has reservations about the film and what it conveys to young people . <p> The son of the famous and talented black director , Melvin Van Peebles , Mario Van Peebles was a film and TV actor and television director before making his cinematic directorial debut with " New Jack City . " It is an ambitious film , a message-oriented action picture meant to entertain and to instruct - surreptitiously . It is a gangster film with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of better things , are seen to betray their community . The heroes are black , white , and Asian-American - symbolizing the solidarity needed among the races to overcome drug abuse and violence . <p> The many disturbing acts of violence in the picture mirror real life . Mr. Van Peebles based his film on a true story , toning down certain events because the reality would have been too gruesome for the vast majority of viewers . The subject matter itself is volatile territory . But Van Peebles 's message is clear : Crack kills . Those who live by it , die for it - harming everyone around them . <p> Reached by telephone , Van Peebles said he has been surprised and saddened by the negative publicity his film has received from the press by people who have not seen the film . " It 's been a sacrificial lamb . Of all the movies to do that to ! Kids will sit and watch the body count go up in ' Total Recall ' and I challenge anyone to tell me the socially redeeming aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate to <p> Van Peebles says he set out to create factual entertainment the kids from the gangs would relate to . " I know these kids . I used to work in a drug treatment center . If they see a soft , sanitized version of this world , they will immediately discount it as inauthentic ... I deliberately set out to do a piece of entertainment that would reach the boys and girls who were in danger of going into that world . The film is a tough film , but it 's accurate . Kids have told me this is the kind of film that makes drug dealers uncomfortable . As ( rap artist and the film 's star ) Ice-T points out , in ' New Jack City ' anyone who smokes crack dies . Anyone who deals crack dies . Anyone who touches crack dies . " <p> Van Peebles went to a lot of trouble to underscore his central message with important secondary messages . Like its genre predecessors of the 1930s , " New Jack City " shows the rise and fall of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Nino Brown starts out with a unified organization of loyal followers - all of whom are either cold-blooded killers or equally remorseless exploiters of their own people . One by one they die , taken out by their rivals or by Nino himself , until he is left alone . <p> But unlike most gangster movies , old or recent , " New Jack City " shows the havoc wreaked on the innocent by the guilty . " It is the first gangster picture ever to show what gangsters do to ordinary people , " the director points out . " When you watch " The Godfather , " he ( Brando ) is such a romantic guy . You do n't see him breaking legs , you do n't see how he lives by violence . " <p> Running right through the film are biblical references and undercurrents reenforcing the antidrug messages . Gang members repeat over and over " Am I my brother 's keeper ? " They always reply " Yes , I am . " But they betray their brothers and sisters . As Ice-T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst kind of brother . He wo n't sell it to his sister , he wo n't sell it to his mother , but he 'll sell it to his boys on the street . " <p> Religious references <p> " Yes , there are a lot of religious undertones in the film , " says Van Peebles . " I can get away with that because the movie has that authenticity . It 's actually a very preachy movie ... I ca n't say I was brought up religiously , but the biggest thing in my life is that all religions have at their core , ' Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . " ' <p> Van Peebles thoroughly deglamorizes drug consumption . When we see people smoking crack or stoned on it , it 's always a hideous sight - no romanticization of the drug high here . Nino 's operation is hell on earth , says Van Peebles . " The Crack house is Dante 's Inferno - the circle of the damned . " <p> One of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the races . The hero-cops ( Van Peebles plays one of them ) are black , white , and Asian-American . They have their differences and their prejudices , but despite all the street-bully antagonisms , they must work together to survive and to overcome . <p> " I am half black and half white , " says Van Peebles . " One of the good things about that fact is that I ca n't hate anybody . The world is my brother and my sister . " He felt it was important to include a white character who cares . " A lot of people feel the inner cities have been allowed to have the influx of drugs running rampant . That stuff is stopable . " So , when a young addict named Pookie is murdered , a white cop ( Judd Nelson ) says " Crack is n't a black thing or a white thing , it 's a death thing . " <p> A death thing it might be , but crack is big business . When we ask children to say no to drugs , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Looking for alternatives <p> " The only ray of hope I can see is education , " says Van Peebles . " You ca n't sell drugs , that 's not a viable alternative . But one problem is , these kids look up to the white white-collar criminals like those involved in the savings and loan scandals and see that they are n't going to jail . These guys have money , they have education , and look what they 're doing . They wo n't go to jail because they have powerful friends . Nino Brown does n't have such powerful friends . So , yes , the movie is an indictment of Nino Brown , but it 's also an indictment of the system that created him . Uzis are n't made in Harlem . Poppy fields do n't grow in Harlem . How do you think all these drugs got here ? " <p> " There is no excuse for selling poison to anyone , " Van Peebles continues . " And there 's no excuse for violence at a soccer match , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Understanding the sociological conditions of violence does not mean excusing it . <p> Still , with his good intentions , lively cinematic style , and honesty , has Van Peebles inadvertently contributed to the problem of violence in the inner city by depicting it on screen ? The problem may lie with the very nature of the cinematic image . <p> The influence of images <p> Children and young teens do not necessarily " read " images the way adults do . Movies have a peculiar power over their viewers and may be " read " on many levels . And the cinematic image can be said to be a two-edged sword . Images that might not disturb one viewer may well disturb another . The thing being exposed and excoriated on film may still be misinterpreted by some viewers whose personal experiences inform their perception of what happens on screen . <p> Many of the youths Kelly counsels are exposed to dreadful violence and sophisticated weapons every day . Bombarded by violence , violent images attract them in film . Because some of these kids have trouble distinguishing between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message the filmmakers intend for them to receive . <p> The positive message may be lost behind the images of power , money , sex , and violence . " A number of my kids who saw it , mainly ( the ) Bloods ( gang ) , really identified with it , " Kelly says . " They look at Nino Brown as a high-class high roller . " <p> " I looked at the reactions of some of the kids who were there , " he continues . " They were infatuated with the money , the violence , and the girls . The glamour part of it seemed to have overridden any other type of message . The thing is , I see many movies , particularly those that draw the kids and I know how they are influenced . " <p> Still , how can one tell this story without an honest portrayal of the violence ? " Everything that was portrayed on that screen was a reality , " Kelly admits . " The girl who shot a man in the head with no remorse - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did express doubts about a key device in the film . A policeman would never take a reformed crack addict and expose him to the drug environment again as Scotty does Pookie - even to infiltrate a drug ring . <p> " In order to kick cocaine you can not go back into that environment . So , to me the movie ( at that point ) shows people they ca n't really quit . " <p> " My thing , " says Kelly , " is using a film like this to show these kids some of the reality ( of gang life ) . You ca n't trust anybody in the drug business . In this type of a game there are no winners ... I would focus on the negative parts when talking to the kids about the movie . ( Drug dealing ) is dog-eat-dog . You will not win . Just as you went up , you will come down . I think if a group of people see " New Jack City " and if it was used as a discussion piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But just for a kid to go see it , it would be left up to that kid which way he was going to receive it . <p> " I have to give Van Peebles credit , " Kelly adds thoughtfully . " I can really praise him , for trying to get out the message . And I know that no matter what you try to do and how you do it there 's going to be criticism . "
