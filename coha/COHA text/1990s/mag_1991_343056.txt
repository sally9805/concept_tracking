Even before the trial began , the atmosphere in courtroom No. 01 of the Beijing Intermediate People 's Court was foreboding . Black curtains were drawn across the windows , and most seats were filled with men in uniforms . Only two women in the third row , clearly apprehensive , looked out of place . <P> At 8:30 a.m. the lights suddenly brightened , and Chen Ziming , 38 , one of China 's leading dissidents , was led in . Stepping into the dock , he looked up at the gallery  --  and into the eyes of his mother and his sister . It had been more than a year since they had seen him . For the next five hours , prosecutors harangued Chen as a counter-revolutionary who had financed the 1989 student rebellion in Tiananmen Square . Despite his 40-min. rebuttal , the trial moved inexorably to its verdict : guilty , with a sentence of 13 years in prison . <P> For the preceding four weeks , Chinese courts had been churning through 29 similar trials with remarkable , if cruel , efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wang Juntao , 32 , an editor at the Beijing Social and Economic Research Institute , a private think tank headed by Chen . But those among the defendants who showed signs of repentance were treated " leniently " and given lighter sentences . Student leader Wang Dan , the most wanted student after the Tiananmen massacre , drew only four years because he recanted and " exposed others "  --  among them Chen Ziming , as prosecutors claimed at last week 's trial . <P> U.S. officials expressed dismay at the sentences for Chen and Wang , which were the longest meted out . Senior officials had been working on the cases since last November . Said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler : " The speed of the verdicts , the limited opportunity afforded the defendants to prepare a defense and the inability of independent observers to attend the trials inevitably raises questions of justice , fairness and due process . " <P> Chen and his family had little chance against the court . Despite his weakened condition from an attempt to delay the trial with a hunger strike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family and friends refuse to give up hope . They contend that improving domestic conditions and international pressure may yet help him . Says his sister : " We believe he is not guilty . We believe that history and people in the end will understand him and recognize this fact . " In the meantime , the democratic ideals for which Chen sacrificed his freedom seem more remote than ever .
