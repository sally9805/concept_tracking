<p> Like his counterparts in 49 other states , E. Norris Tolson is eagerly awaiting a windfall from Washington . As North Carolina 's recently appointed secretary of transportation , Tolson can soon expect to get his hands on more than $ 700 million a year from the new highway and mass transit legislation that Congress passed on Friday . <p> By far , the largest chunk of the more than $ 200 billion in the six-year reauthorization bill will be spent on the nation 's highway system . But spent for what ? The answer to that question may not be known for years , but here and in other state capitals across the country , the surge of new federal money is likely to set off renewed debate over how much should be spent expanding the highway system to relieve congestion and propel economic development , and how much should go to preserving what is already in place . <p> To a large extent , it will be state officials like Tolson who will make those decisions . For while the highway measure has numerous well-publicized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional parlance  --  there is far more money at stake in other categories in the bill that allow state officials wide latitude in deciding how to spend it . <p> The debate over expansion versus preservation of the highway system has become more intense since the virtual completion of the Interstate Highway System , the focus of federal transportation policy since the 1950s . To critics of state transportation departments such as the Surface Transportation Policy Project , a Washington-based advocacy group , in the past states have been too willing to widen roads and build new ones at the expense of maintenance and preservation . <p> " For the last 40 years , we have been engaged in building the Interstate System and the National Highway System which consists of the Interstate highways and other designated primary roads , " said Hank Dittmar , the organization 's executive director . " It is an enormous investment and to fail to maintain that system is criminal . You 're essentially throwing away your capital . " <p> Dittmar contends that a hefty portion of projected highway construction spending will only encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were n't building the roads that generate the sprawl , would you need to build the roads to serve the sprawl , " he said . <p> Tolson agrees that there is " an element of truth " to the sprawl argument but says in high-growth areas such as the high-tech Research Triangle around Raleigh , Durham and Chapel Hill , the traffic " is going to go there anyway . You either accommodate it or you strangle your city with traffic and air pollution . " <p> Like most state officials , he also sees economic growth  --  which means building roads , sewers and other parts of the physical infrastructure  --  as an imperative . " A lot of what you do in new construction is related to economic development , " Tolson said . " As industry moves out from the urbanized areas , you 've got to build the infrastructure to take care of it or encourage it . " <p> According to the most recent figures available from the Federal Highway Administration , the instinct to widen and build may be diminishing . <p> Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual report on the condition of the nation 's surface transportation system , the share of federal and state spending on road and bridge projects that expanded the system dropped from 49 to 41 percent . During the same period , the share of capital expenditures to preserve the system increased from 45 to 50 percent . The remainder of the spending was for other measures such as safety improvements . <p> In the same report , the FHA also said that the condition of the nation 's highway system has remained stable or improved slightly . <p> But there is no guarantee that these trends will continue when higher levels of federal transportation funds under the new legislation begin to flow to the states . Strong local political and economic pressures always have encouraged road building in the country as an engine of economic growth , and soon there will be even more federal dollars available to pursue that goal . The funding formula that the federal government uses to help the states meet their highway needs is also an incentive to take on large capital improvements . <p> Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay to maintain the highway system , leaving that obligation to the states . But the federal government does offer $ 4 of its money for every $ 1 in state funds that go for " capital projects . " These do not necessarily have to involve widening existing roads or building new ones , but in practice that is often what happens . In effect , the federal financing system encourages states to spend the maximum on capital projects in order to receive the maximum in federal matching funds . <p> " Most states ' gas tax revenues go into two large buckets  --  one for maintenance and a second bucket to match the federal aid money , " said David T. Hartgen , professor of transportation studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte . " When I wiggle in front of your nose $ 4 for every $ 1 in one bucket and zero dollars for what comes out of the other bucket , it does n't take a PhD in transportation finance to understand what you 're going to do . You 're going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . " <p> The money in the $ 4 bucket comes from the 18-cent federal gasoline tax , much of which is returned to the states according to a formula set by Congress . In the revised formula in the new highway legislation , so-called " donor states " such as North Carolina  --  which have been sending more in gas tax receipts to Washington than they 've gotten back in federal grants  --  are among the big winners . North Carolina will get more than a 50 percent increase in highway funds . <p> No one disputes the need for road-widening and new highway construction in many parts of the country , especially in high-growth states such as North Carolina . In 1989 , the state legislature here embarked on an ambitious building program by creating a special Highway Trust Fund with a portion of its state gasoline tax revenue . The fund , along with matching federal money , was to be used to build " loop roads " around seven cities , widen two-lane highways to four lanes and pave unpaved rural roads . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of North Carolina 's highway spending went for maintenance , one of the highest ratios in the country . But by 1996 , the maintenance share had shrunk to 24 percent , still more than many other states but a precipitous shift in priorities . <p> " As the capital focus diverts funds from maintenance , the overall quality of the existing system declines , " Hartgen warned in a report last December . " At some point , the decline accelerates , so that it becomes impossible to maintain the system at current levels or improve it without great cost . " <p> In another report for the state auditor 's office issued last week , KPMG Peat Marwick LLP reached a similar conclusion . While North Carolina is spending more than ever to maintain its highway system , the report said , " when adjusted for inflation and system growth , maintenance funds have not increased to meet these additional demands . " <p> It is not difficult to understand the attraction of road building to highway engineers , contractors and their local civic boosters . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolson . " That 's what everybody gets excited about . " <p> " What 's driving this is the visibility of those projects , " said Hartgen . " Every community in the state believes it has a worthy project either for capacity needs or for urban development . They believe a four-lane road will bail them out of whatever economic situation they find themselves in . " <p> Even when doubts occur about the wisdom of a highway project , the allure of the money  --  state funds usually matched four-to-one by the federal government  --  can be irresistible . <p> " In Winston-Salem , the loop road was not particularly popular even among city council members , " said Nat Mund , director of governmental relations for the Conservation Council of North Carolina . " However , the idea of being left out of the money that was coming was unpalatable . " <p> In his brief tenure heading the transportation department , Tolson has received high marks from Mund and leaders of other environmental and conservation groups . He had been the state 's commerce secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( D ) turned to Tolson for help with the troubled Transportation Department , where three Transportation Board members had been forced to resign amid conflict-of-interest allegations . <p> Tolson estimates the highway maintenance backlog is about $ 170 million and he has asked the legislature for additional funding to begin closing the gap . North Carolina plans " a huge amount of new construction " with its share of the new federal transportation funds , he said , but in the longer term also recognizes that there is a limit to road building and a need to focus more on mass transportation in and between its major cities . <p> " We know that 15 or 20 years from now  --  and some of our cities are already in this situation  --  urbanized North Carolina will not be able to continue to move traffic around safely with just more lanes on the highways , " he said . " You ca n't do it . "
