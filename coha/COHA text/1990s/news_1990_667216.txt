<p> Computer ratings for the 193 Division I-A and I-AA football teams were devised by Jeff Sagarin , a 1970 MIT mathematics graduate . <p> The number to the left of each team is its rank among the teams . The rating to the right is a numerical measure of the team 's strength . A hypothetical victory margin is determined by comparing the rating of the two teams after adding three points to the home team . <p> Schedule strength is the average of the ratings of only the Division I-A and I-AA games played . <p> A diminishing returns principle exists to prevent teams from building up ratings by running up large victory margins against weak teams . Instead , it rewards teams that do well against good opponents . <p> Team 194 represents games that Div . I-A and I-AA teams have played against Div . II , III and/or NAIA opponents . Div . I-A and I-AA teams are collectively 72-22 against unrated opponents this season . Through Sunday . <p> - This information plus NFL and NBA ratings are available on-line from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schedule No .
