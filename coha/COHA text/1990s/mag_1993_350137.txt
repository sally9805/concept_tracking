Jeffrey Grossholz has pulled up stakes 36 times during his career , but in 1989 he came to Waxahachie , Texas , to stay . While the 50-year-old structural engineer had helped build plenty of shopping malls and bridges in his time , they seemed like nothing when he first heard of the superconducting supercollider ( SSC ) . Recalls Grossholz : " I said , ' This is it . ' It was a helluva project , something we could all have been proud of , something we could have passed on to our kids . " <P> Now Grossholz is in shock , as are thousands of other engineers , construction workers , scientists  --  and most of Texas . With $2 billion already spent and the project 20% complete , the world 's largest and most sophisticated scientific instrument , a particle accelerator designed to probe the innermost secrets of the universe , was canceled last week by a 282-to-143 vote in the House of Representatives . Said Ohio Democrat Eric Fingerhut : " This was a project that we could n't afford . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The SSC 's supporters were appalled . " It 's disheartening that a large number of fairly intelligent people could do such a dumb thing , " lamented Nobel- prizewinning physicist Leon Lederman . His frustration is understandable . Since the 1930s , physicists have been using accelerators to smash atoms together and analyze the debris , with an impressive result : the discovery that matter in all its complex forms seems to be made up of just a few simple particles operating under a handful of basic forces . But this so-called Standard Model is a puzzle that 's not quite complete , and finding the last pieces would take something like the SSC . The 10,000 superconducting magnets in the collider 's planned 54-mile underground oval tunnel were going to accelerate protons to nearly the speed of light , then crash them together with unprecedented power . <P> Pleading for the SSC before Congress , researchers like Lederman used the Ultimate Quest argument ; others spoke of retaining America 's leadership in science and technology , or of the jobs SSC would generate , or of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nonetheless , the project 's super price tag  --  originally estimated at $5 billion but up to $11 billion at last count  --  was a perpetual and powerful counterargument . Specialists in other fields of science , and even different areas of physics , resented such largesse being heaped on a relatively small number of researchers at a time of national belt tightening . <P> It 's tempting to call the SSC 's demise the end of big science , but it would be more accurate to describe it as the end of big , bloated , bungled science . The original budget turned out to have omitted several crucial items that surfaced only after Congress approved the project . The superconducting magnets had to be designed a second time after the first try failed . And in June , Energy Department investigators reported that employees were living it up at SSC 's Dallas headquarters , freely spending taxpayers ' money on liquor , lavish parties and office decor ( $56,000 went for potted plants ) .
