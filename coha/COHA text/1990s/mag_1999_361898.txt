Republicans regularly bludgeon Reno for rejecting LaBella 's call for an independent counsel to follow the trail of alleged campaign violations into President Clinton 's inner circle . Next week LaBella returns to Washington in triumph . FBI director Louis Freeh is staging an invitation-only ceremony at which he intends to bestow upon LaBella a " Director 's Award for Excellence . " <P> Some at Justice and on the Hill regard Freeh 's move as a taunt at Reno , who 's resented by senior FBI executives as too solicitous of the White House .

Bush Administration . " Freeh is widely seen by the Democrats as grandstanding and being far too political for that job , " says a congressional Democratic staff member . But Freeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just giving an award to Chuck LaBella , a person he admires , for a job well done , " says an aide .
