<p> I grew up in Chicago in a Chinese-American family and , like most Americans , we sat down each year to a Thanksgiving dinner of roasted turkey . That 's where the similarities to the traditional American Thanksgiving meal began and ended , though . <p> A newcomer from South China , my mother did n't understand the historical and cultural implications of Thanksgiving . But this was a food holiday and that was something the whole family did understand . So my mother assembled a Chinese-American version of the very American bird with its bread stuffing and trimmings . I have sinced learned that many of my fellow Chinese-Americans enjoyed similar versions of Mother 's turkey . <p> To start with , to my mother the turkey was like something from outer space . She had never seen birds so big  --  big enough to feed an entire village . Our turkey was usually stuffed with glutinous rice mixed with sausage , which Chinese cooks usually used for chicken . Most often the turkey was steamed first , then roasted briefly to make the skin crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Chinese method of steaming the large bird ensured that the turkey stayed moist , unlike the usual American-style product . <p> My mother used a large enamel turkey roaster to steam the bird . In China , because only restaurants had ovens , we would have fried the turkey after the steaming to give the color and crispness . In America , we made the most of our oven . Many Chinese-Americans still do n't have ovens , possibly because Chinese delicatessens routinely will roast your turkey , just the way they offer roasted ducks . <p> My mother always got the smallest turkey possible . I always wonder if it was because of our small oven or the tiny refrigerator that we had . Or perhaps she could n't stand to have turkey leftovers for weeks on end . <p> But we loved those leftovers . My mother was a master at making a daily feast of the them . The carcass would be carefully stripped of every morsel of meat that could be used in soup , sometimes with slivers of pressed bean curd added for texture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soup both color and texture . It was a refreshing and delightful soup . <p> I also loved leftover turkey meat that my mother would stir-fry with oyster sauce and onions . Formerly bland turkey meat came alive in this quick smoky stir-fry , which we ate with plain steamed rice . A delicate savory steamed egg custard with chopped turkey meat also appeared on our post-Thanksgiving table . The quivering , barely set custard was a lovely contrast to the coarse turkey ( which was lightened considerably ) . <p> However , my favorite was always her stir-fried turkey with tasty black beans . Here , she made a delicious sauce with pungent fermented black beans , bursting with garlic and ginger aromas that turned the mild turkey into a flavorful dish . Because the Chinese abhor dried-out meat , the leftover turkey was always added at the last moment to keep it succulent in the sauce . Although the tastes were familiar , for me the dishes were exotic because of the turkey . And any leftover rice stuffing was simply stir-fried into crispy bits , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese-American creations that made the best of what was left . <p> My mother even managed to deliciously recycle the turkey bones in a comforting Shee Fan , a delectable rice porridge that I remember to this day . In fact , I love to cook turkey so that I have the carcass with its unique flavor . It makes the week after Thanksgiving worth the year-long wait . <p> TURKEY-ICEBERG <p> LETTUCE SOUP <p> ( 4 servings ) <p> This quick and easy recipe was used by my mother to start the post-Thanksgiving meal . The ingredients were easily available and inexpensive .
