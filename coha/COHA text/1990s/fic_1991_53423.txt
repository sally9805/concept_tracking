IT MIGHT BE OUT of the run of things to buy a house made out of a church , though nothing you 'd call exceptional . It would have been smarter to rent perhaps , but Brian had had enough of apartments , and this was really the only house in the small New England town for sale . When he pondered his recent dry spell with the writing , he thought it was due , well , possibly due to the feeling of rank impermanence that pervaded his soul  --  his spirit , whatever . He did not much believe in his soul . He 'd begun to feel he was passing through ... Passing through what ? And that , of course , he was leaving unanswered . <p> So he summoned his wife of eleven years , who was thoroughly sick of apartment living and had gone for a long sojourn with her mother . They had seemed of late somewhat less than married , and this perhaps was her reason for leaving . Now catching the lively note in his voice , she decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't minded his hours of writing . When he was at it , wherever his thoughts , she felt included , felt vaguely needed . It was the hours he gazed into space  --  and these were becoming a generous portion of every day  --  that locked her out . Wiped her out , she wanted to say . As if he were back in those distant parts he 'd traveled in before they met . <p> They converged on the house from different directions , she . from Connecticut , he from New York . They arrived at almost the very same time on a fairish day the end of June . <p> " Have you already bought it ? " Her name was Alice . <p> " Of course not , " he said . " I would n't do that before you 'd seen it . " <p> " That 's nice , " she said . She was small and blond and softly featured , with the sort of face a man could summon and come to wonder why he had . Her eyes were blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't see a blessed thing . And when they were in , she saw no more than she wanted to see , unless requested to see some more . <p> " You said on the phone it 's Anglican . My mother was one before she married , but Daddy did n't believe in it . " She was a sweetly diligent woman on the brink of forty  --  Brian was older , forty-eight  --  but she gave the impression of indolence , for she had the knack of appearing freshly bathed and anointed , however vigorous her day . <p> It still looked very much like a church , the cruciform shape of it intact . The modest belfry was bereft of its bell , but they could n't see that from where they stood . The painters had done it all in green  --  a secular green , which they labeled " fern " and which blended nicely with all the spruce-and added shutters and painted them brick . <p> " I 'd like the shutters better white . Why would they sell a church ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . " The realtor , a Mr. Turnbull , says that over the years the congregation moved away and those that were left could n't keep it up . They drive to a bigger church somewhere . They like to get in their cars and go . Have Sunday dinner out of town . The village is really pretty small . " <p> " How small ? " said Alice . <p> " I did n't ask . Because I 'm not opening a grocery store . But look around . " Alice would always go into statistics . " Turnbull says the residents are very keen on keeping it small . I thought that was what we wanted , " he said . <p> And the church was small , as churches go . The tiny narthex was now a foyer . The nave of course was the living room , soaring thirty-five feet or so , with dark crossbeams in the vaulted roof and hanging lights and pointed windows . The old stained glass had been removed . A strip of carpet , crimson as some exotic bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors gleamed dark on either side . " The original flooring , according to Turnbull . All heartwood , according to him . Dry rot or something claimed the rest , so they tore it down and built it back , oh , sixty years or so ago . Before the Depression hit , he said . So everything is up to snuff . The carpet will have to go , of course . " <p> " It 's a little red but not too bad . What have they done with the pews ? " she asked . <p> " Well , one of them is in the foyer . I expect they sold the rest for cash . Are n't they always looking for cash ? " <p> " Is there such a thing as a churchyard sale ? " She was feeling glad . She squinted up at the vaulted top . " How do we get the cobwebs down ? " <p> He was feeling rather good himself . There was nothing said , but they separately knew , and together knew , that this was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to various parts of the world , in the main remote , looking for things to seed his mind and harvest if they took root and grew . He had strained so long to catch so much that his eyes were losing their power to see what was useful to him and what was not . He felt like a child in blindman 's bluff who is scarfed and twirled till he 's lost his way .... He had married her roots and her way of seeing just so much . Marriage had turned the trick for him . For a while ... till he found he wanted more . Till he longed to try his eyes again . He had failed to keep her from finding out . Though he never saw them , he felt her tears . " Cobwebs ? " he said . " Who 'd ever see ' em ? If it 's guests you mean , the carpet will strike them blind and deaf . " <p> The transepts had both been turned into bedrooms with doors to cut them off from the nave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the rear on the left a door led into the breakfast room-kitchen and one on the right to a bedroom , a nursery , a storage room , whatever you wanted , the realtor had said . Both were narrow and looked out over the garden plot . <p> Nestled between these rooms was his study , a tiny room but with space enough for his desk he saw . With a generous window , newly cut , it too looked over the little garden . The same red carpet covered the floor . High on the wall a square-cut pane of colored glass let in a vivid reddish light . <p> " I 'm not sure about that light , " he said . <p> " Nonsense , " she said , her voice with a lilt . " Your books are inclined to be gloomy , you know . This will probably lighten them up . " <p> " It 's news to me you think they 're gloomy . " <p> She waved her hand . " Gloomy in spots was all I meant . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She did not want to go into that . " Let 's take it , " she said . " I like it a lot . And it 's such a bargain . " She looked around with a little smile . " It will be a challenge , do n't you think ? Living in a church . We shall have to turn from our wicked ways . " <p> He laughed at that . " Let 's not , " he said . He slanted his eyes at the carpet below . " This rug will have to go , " he said . " Here and in there . " <p> " You mean the color . I guess you 're right . " <p> But when they were all moved in that August , and he brought the carpet up again , she flatly stated she wanted to wait . " Till we can afford what we really want . When you finish the book and get your advance .... Let 's not rush in where angels would n't fear to tread . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Her pointless humor left him cold . " It 's a house ... a house . A house is a house is a house . " <p> " Still ... , " she said but did n't finish . <p> He had been surprised that she seemed to like the house a lot . He had thought he would have to push it a bit . He was happy at first with a kind of boyish anticipation . He was glad to be away from the city . He had put off writing until he was settled . They took long walks in the afternoons through woods and fields . She bought a book at the local store that helped her to name the flowers they found . She filled the house with bunches of them . " They keep the eye from the rafters , " she said . <p> He used to be good with a hammer and saw and found he had not forgotten his skill . He built her boxes for white petunias and pink begonias and shelves to hold them to the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen walls . They were both surprised to find her domestic . She purchased berries from roadside trucks and put them up into jars she bought . And while she worked she hummed a tune he could n't recall having heard before . It was always the same , a stately measure . She hummed it as if she were thinking the words . Sometimes he could see them in her eyes as she raised a glass of preserves to the light . But he did not know or ask the words . <p> The garden in back had gone to ruin . He spent long hours in setting it straight , hacking away at the honeysuckle that choked the herbs and the morning glories that stitched together the hollyhocks , which must , he supposed , have reseeded themselves . There were some splendid laurel shrubs that he spent a week in shaping well and rangy lilacs past their prime that he pruned and nourished for next year 's bloom . He found an unexpected treasure : a well-established asparagus bed . He assumed it had been there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be carefully plucked away . Honeysuckle had claimed the stalks and had to be scrupulously unwound . The apple trees looked promising but needed the proper spray , he guessed , whenever he got around to them . <p> It was in so hacking , unwinding , and pruning , with a kind of nervous , tight-lipped vigor , that he came upon the open graves not fifty feet beyond the house . There were holes , a dozen of them , which a careless hand had filled with soil . But the soil had settled , and now they were basins to hold the rain and mirror the sky and mirror his face as he leaned above them to tear the cover of vines away . He would hardly have known what he 'd come across if it had not been for the bits of granite , shards of headstones with remnants of chiseled dates and names . <p> He could not really account for his shock . He turned away and called to his wife , who was potting begonias . She came with her hands in garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've bought an abandoned graveyard , " he said . " I could throw the damn thing in Turnbull 's face ! " <p> She peered into one of the cavities . " Why ? " she said . " What did you expect ? People get buried around a church . " <p> " It does n't bother you in the least ? " <p> " Why should it ? " she asked . She would often parry his question with hers , a habit he had never liked . " I suppose they 're moved to another church . " She looked at him with serene and faintly humorous eyes . " Well , they could n't sell us the people , could they ? Is n't it better to move them away ? " <p> " I did n't bargain for any of this . " <p> She was following the line of low granite stones that formed the enclosure . And then she stopped . " Look , " she said , " here 's one that 's left . " She dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a man named Joseph Jones . 1868 to 1916 . " She read aloud : " Here lies the body of Joseph Jones . May he be cursed who moves my bones . ' " She looked up , wondering . " Well , that explains it  --  why he was n't moved . " <p> " God ! " he said . <p> He drove straight in and accosted Turnbull . <p> " You have me confused . What is your complaint ? " The matey , helpful manner was gone . " You ca n't have wanted the people left . There 's a law against it , anyway . If the boys were careless about filling the holes  --  I expect it rained and settled the dirt  --  I 'll send them out tomorrow some time and have the spots filled in and smoothed . " <p> " Are you aware that one is left ? " <p> " Well , yes , there 's one that could n't be moved . At least nobody wanted to do it . People are skittish about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . If it 's in a will they could n't care less. , but carved on a stone is something else . " <p> " So you 're just going to leave him buried there . " <p> " I 'm afraid that 's so . If you want to go into it legally ... I mean get the court 's permission to dig him . But then you 'll have to put him somewhere , and get permission for where you put him , and that 's the law . But the Church will probably have lots to say . <p> " Brian turned on his heel and left . <p> He left the cavities just as they were . Nobody arrived to fill them in . He had lost his taste for the garden , he found . The thought occurred that he worked in the garden , made boxes for plants , or went for walks because it kept him away from his study . When he understood this to be the case he took himself quite firmly in hand and walked the length of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crimson way , as if caught up in some kind of procession  --  and entered his study and sat at his desk , his back to the window as well as the garden , and quite deliberately took up his pen . <p> He became aware of a certain oppression . Something a little like childish dread . The feeling of being awash in sorrow and thinking it would have no end . It was very faint , like a distant echo . The room itself , though miniature , seemed unaccountably full of space . He forced himself to scan the wall to assure himself that the room was small . An interesting trick of the mind , he thought .... <p> Once when he traveled in India he had entered a tiny temple at dusk . The walls he could tell were painted with figures , but the light was too dim to tell what they were . He made his way to the center of the room and turned and turned as he strained to see , and suddenly the Walls receded . The figures seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . He had stumbled out and gone his way .... <p> But that was India , a different land . Whatever it was , you did n't take it back with you . You did n't let it into your house . <p> He forced his eyes to the paper now . The contact served to reassure him . But the crimson carpet was in his eyes , and just beyond lay a square of light like a splash of wine where the reddish glow from the pane in the wall was lying upon the carpet red . <p> He told his wife he was ripping the carpet up in his study . And he went about it with resolution , tossing the whole of it into the trash . There was mold on the underlying boards , so down on his hands and knees he scrubbed . He scrubbed them into a burnished gray and then surveyed them with satisfaction . Again he seated himself at his desk . The light from the pane on his bare wood floor was the splash of a different sort of wine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study wall he could hear his wife humming away at her usual song above the shrill of running water . <p> He got up and went to the kitchen door . She saw him and smiled and went on with her work . She was washing lettuce . " Alice , " he said , " what iS that song , the one you hum ? " <p> She looked surprised and thought for a moment . " Just now ? " she said . The afternoon sun was in her hair . <p> " Just now and always . " <p> She laughed a bit . " I guess it 's The Church 's One Foundation . ' I do n't always hum it . " <p> He heard her words with sharp distaste . " Yes , you do . Why do . you hum it ? " <p> " I 'm sure I hum some other hymns . " <p> " Why must you always hum a hymn ? You never did before we came . " <p> She looked at sea . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It drives me nuts . " <p> " Good Lord , " she said . " Imagine that .... I must have gotten it from my mother . I suppose it just comes naturally . Living in a church , all of that . " <p> " This is n't a church . It 's a house , " he said . He could n't stand the way she was giving in to the place . <p> He returned to his desk . But the sound of her hymn would not release him . Behind him a dozen open graves proclaimed his own mortality . <p> He went for a walk alone in the woods . The trail was a carpet of princess pine . It muffled his step and left him insubstantial as rain , as the resinous scent his foot released . Turning back , he sought his study , and grimly he began to write : Chapter Five of the book in progress months ago . It had to do with an expedition lost in the Alps . Once in Zermatt he had heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All the details he had finely imagined . It was the sort of thing he could do . The feel of the snow , the light on the peaks , the haunted nights , the savor of hope , the worm of despair . He forced himself to recapture the scene , recalling the winter month in Zermatt , the looming presence of the Matterhorn . <p> But his mind unaccountably drifted from it into a scene half a world away , one he had not thought of for years and even at the time had thought little about . He had been traveling for days in Burma and had heard of a festival on his route . In the midst of a famine they could celebrate ! Or perhaps because of the famine they could , treading their hunger into the ground . He had stationed himself by the main thoroughfare to watch the procession when , abruptly , a small woman dashed from the crowd and lifted to him a small brown baby . He was used to giving alms when accosted . Mechanically he had reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child while she put the fifty-cent piece away . Trying to conceal his awkwardness he took the baby into his arms , and at once she turned and dashed away . For an instant he was too stunned to move , but then he endeavored to follow her . She had lost herself in the milling crowd . His search was useless , he presently saw , and at last he looked at the child in his arms , a little boy  --  a few months old , it was hard to tell . The great brown eyes were old and trusting . He had never seen such trusting eyes . The lips were the shape of a tiny plum . But the arms that grasped his neck were frail , and the folded legs were a tangle of bones . He was swept along by the surging crowd till he saw an old and wizened man , a loincloth about his hips , who sat cross-legged with a heap of sticks . With corded hands extended as if to a feeble blaze , he was shielding the sticks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and drawn two dollar bills from his pocket . He handed the bills and the child to the man and , like the woman , passed into the crowd .... <p> Now sitting at his familiar desk with the splash of red on the floor before him , it seemed to him that he would weep . It seemed to him that his life had crested and fallen then , and why this was so he could not say . When years before he had lost himself in that alien throng , he had lost himself .... He was filled with grief that he and Alice had no child . He had never grieved for the lack before . In fact , he had counted it fortunate . It was clear to him now he deserved no child . <p> My God , he thought , it 's this damnable place . He got up and found his wife in the yard . She was saying good-bye to a Mrs. Hiller , who lived down the road . A wind had risen and was stirring the grass . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and walked away . The wind was whipping the ends of her scarf . Her short , spare figure , her rapid walk , for a moment put him in mind of someone  --  the woman who had lost herself in the crowd . Or was it himself , who like the woman had walked away ? <p> Alice turned with a welcoming smile . " Mrs. Hiller used to go to this church . " She pursed her lips . " This house , when it used to be a church . She says your study is right where the sanctuary used to be , where the altar was . The red pane of glass was above the altar . She says Father Damon , who was priest here for years , she says he was fond of telling them that every altar is the center of the earth . Is n't that nice ? 1 like it , do n't you ? " <p> He stared at her with incredulous eyes . How could she possibly think he would like it ? Was she wholly lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as totally clean as the rest of her always appeared to be . Was her innocent-seeming persistence a cloak for some resentment that festered within ? He began to fear that from the start he and his wife had been mismatched and that each could only wound the other . <p> That night she slept at peace beside him , stirring a little , smiling a little , while he lay awake and thought of the graves . He went to sleep as dawn was breaking . <p> At breakfast she said , " You know what I dreamt ? I dreamt that man , that Joseph Jones , who is still out there , came into our room and looked at us . And you know what he said ? He said , There is no giving in marriage in heaven . ' I think that 's in the Bible , is n't it ? " <p> " I would n't know . I 'm an unbeliever . " <p> " There 's really no such thing , " she said . <p> " A ghost . or an unbeliever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . " <p> " You guess ? " <p> " I guess . Brian , " she said , " you mix me up . Does it give you pleasure ? " <p> " I assure you I 'm not having fun . " <p> " Well , I 'm not having any fun either . " <p> They left it at that . <p> And yet she did seem to be having fun . She took up the garden where he 'd left it off and gossiped down the road with the neighbors and drank their cups and cups of tea . He went for walks in the woods without her . <p> But on these solitary walks a troubling thing began to occur . He would often hear the sound of a bell , very distant , very faint , a measured , mournful , tolling knell . He found himself walking in time to it . Whenever he paused in the bird-filled shade he noted the tolling would pause as well .... One day when Alice was down the road he got the ladder and mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the attic . From there he could see the door to the belfry . The hempen rope was hanging through . He pulled and it fell with a thud at his feet . A ladder was fastened against the wall . He tugged until he got it loose . Then he climbed and opened the small trap door . The bell was gone , as he knew it would be . Turnbull had said the bell was gone . <p> He did not mention the thing to Alice , but he broached the subject of taking up the living room carpet . <p> " You think so ? " she said , a little line between her eyes . " I thought we were going to wait for your money . " <p> " Look , " he said , " I 'll do all the work . I 'll scrub the boards and stain them to match the ones at the side , and then we can throw some cheap little rugs , two or three of them , around . It wo n't look bare , I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll get the whole thing carpeted . " <p> " Men are supposed to like red , " she said . " All the men I know like red . " <p> " Well , this particular shade of red seems to require a whacking chorus . " <p> " A hymn , " she said . <p> He did not reply . <p> He went to work with the stripping and scrubbing . It was strenuous work . He was on the attack . After two weeks he returned to his study and grimly settled down to write . Each word for him was an act of defiance . And after several hours of this , exhausted , he went for a walk through the town  --  he had given up the walks in the woods  --  then returned and read over what he had written . He was stunned . The delicacy of his touch was gone . He had written the stormy night at the inn . A coarseness pervaded the scene of love . Vulgarity was a better term . <p> I 'm fighting this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will ruin me . He stared at the square of light on the floor , which the afternoon sun gave the color of blood . He thought of the child with the trusting eyes he had bought in Burma for fifty cents and reckoned how old he would be today . Fifteen years and seven months  --  and fourteen days  --  and added to that his age at the time . If he 's still alive , which he doubtless is n't . The child I bought for fifty cents and turned and sold for a couple of bucks . And here I sit in the center of the earth ... with a corpse in my garden and a child who is dead because I sold him . And in a few years I too shall be dead , and what will have been the point of my life ? <p> He stood up and paced the tiny room , stepping over the square of : light , which seemed to shift and faintly to quiver . He felt aloof from the house and his wife . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing supper . But it was as if she were quite remote . He could not quite remember her face . <p> He recalled instead his brother 's face . A time he had taken his . brother fishing because his mother had said he must and how he had locked him up in a shed just before they reached the lake and how his brother had cried with fear . Each step of the way to the shore of the lake he had heard the sobs . He remembered the suck of the marshy earth and the faint whistle of water reeds and the cry of gulls between the sobs . He had caught a fish and then returned to let him out . The face was grimed with dirt and tears . " You can have my fish if you wo n't tell . " His brother had taken his fish in silence and then had thrown it into the lake .... And now the small face disappeared with a tiny click inside . his mind . He was left with a vague , insufferable pain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I simply can not handle it here . I 'm falling apart . " He sat and put his face in his hands . <p> For the first time she really seemed to hear him . She paused with a boning knife in her hand . " Oh , dear , " she said , her blue eyes budding with her dismay . Her hands were red from peeling beets . " Whatever you say , but I liked it here . " Already she placed it in the past . <p> He noted it and was grateful to her . " You 're different , " he said . " You do n't fight the place . " <p> She considered this . " You 're a writer , " she said . " You imagine things more . " <p> " I 've been a writer since I was ten and I never came up with stuff like this . " He was grateful she did not ask him what .

" <p> Distressed , she seemed to probe herself . <p> " Do put down that knife , " he said . <p> " Listen , " she said , " Mrs. Hiller said something . She said the church was never deconsecrated before it was sold . " She watched him hopefully . " I 'm not making this up . She said when a church stops being a church they have a ceremony of deconsecration . The bishop told Father Damon to do it , and he said he would but he did n't , she said . " <p> He stared at her . " Why did n't he ? " <p> " She does n't know . She thought it was maybe an oversight .... Brian , " she said , " let 's get it done .

There 's nothing there but everybody says there is . For maybe years and years they do , and so you do and you really feel ... " <p> " Alice , " he said , " I 'm not a child , and I do n't believe in any of this . " <p> " But all those people who came here did . " <p> " But they 're not here now . We 're here now and we do n't believe . So please put down that bloody knife . " He hated the tone he took with her . He wished she would n't stand for it . She always turned the other cheek . <p> Before they went to bed she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The following day at lunch she reported : " Mrs. Hiller says he has a church at Corinth .

" When she rose to take his plate away , she leaned and kissed the top of his head . He was the child she reassured . <p> Over her coffee and cake she yawned . " I dreamt about that man again . He 's rather nice but lots of beard . He just came in and looked at us and said , My stone is getting warm . ' I suppose he meant his tombstone . " <p> " Alice , " he said , " if you have a rendezvous with Jones , I really do n't care to hear of it . " <p> " You 're jealous , " she said . " That 's very nice .

And something about the past of the house ... " <p> " You 're sure it 's not the present of the house ? " He released her hand . " Because if it is n't , what are we going to Corinth for ?

He was picking golf balls out of the grass . When they appeared he straightened up . He proved to be short and slight of frame with a florid , somewhat freckled face and reddish hair in disarray . His eyes were small and made of steel . They seemed to dismiss whatever you thought , and yet they seemed to want to know . Alice decided she 'd never discuss her life with him , but he might be fun to picnic with . <p> " I 've warned them , " he said . " I 've returned the last they 'll ever get .

" He turned to them . <p> " Quite another matter , " said Brian and introduced himself and Alice . " If we could trouble you for a moment . " <p> " Of course , of course . Come in , come in . I was expecting a brace of parents . " He led them into a small bright office with bamboo blinds that sliced the sunlight into shreds , and on a stand beside his desk stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift , " he said and patted its head . " Some of the faithful are lovers of birds . and shoot them down whenever they can . " Next door someone was typing away at a reckless clip . He waved them into white cane chairs with flowered pads and sat himself behind the desk . He unrolled his sleeves and fastened the cuffs and looked at Brian with curious eyes . " Are you perhaps a member here ? I 'm a recent thing , and part of the flock keeps strolling in just when I think I 've counted them all . " <p> Brian waited . " I 'm not a member of any church . Nor do I believe in God , " he said . <p> Alice wished he would n't be so up front . <p> " I see , " said Damon . " A full-time thing ? Sundays and holidays off perhaps ? Most of my flock take Sundays off . And are you employed with anything else ? " <p> " I 'm a fiction writer . " <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes snapped . " Are you pretty good ? " <p> " I used to be , but not anymore . " <p> " And that , I suppose , is why you 're here . Perhaps you need a psychiatrist . A mental therapist , we call it now . I have a splendid , agnostic friend gets himself hypnotized once a month and then he produces all manner of art . He 's filled the courthouse walls with murals . " <p> Brian eyed him coldly . The typist was rollicking across the page . <p> Thoughtfully Damon stroked the mallard . " Well , I see you do n't fancy a mental therapist . So how can I be of service to you ? " <p> " We have bought a house that was once your church . " <p> " Ah  --  h  --  h , " said the priest , leaning back in his chair with a shrieking of springs . " I knew it would sell . A lovely location . Southern exposure . One of the transept windows is loose . It rattles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course needs tidying up . " <p> " The garden contains some open graves . And one that is still inhabited . " <p> " Pardon me , when you say open graves , ' it does suggest graverobbers at work  --  the bodies inside and sadly exposed . These bodies have been removed , of course , removed to consecrated ground . " <p> " This brings me , " said Brian , " to why I am here . I understand that you failed to deconsecrate the church before it became this home of mine . I ask you to correct the oversight . " <p> Damon got up and took a turn behind his desk and adjusted a blind . " Well , well , well . " The typist was rattling like one possessed . He walked to her door . " Cordelia , my dear , why do n't we give the machine a rest ? Find something that 's dry and water it . Or something that squeaks and give it some oil . " The typing ceased . He returned to his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . Someone has let the cat out of the bag . It was not , I may say , an oversight . " <p> " An act of disobedience , perhaps ? " <p> " Precisely that . Precisely that . " He smoothed his ruffled hair a bit , and then he raked it the other way . " And if I do n't come and put it to rights , you 'll tell the bishop on me , eh ? Just let me jot down his name and address . His telephone number may be of use . He 's in his office after ten but takes a nap from one to three . A touch of asthma . Advised to rest . " <p> " Oh , no , " said Alice , becoming alarmed . " We would n't do that . We truly would n't . " <p> " I like to arouse the bishop , " said Damon . " It gives him pleasure to be aroused . And then he forgives me ten times over . It makes us both feel closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think .... Just what is the problem you have ? " he said . " It ca n't be a theological one . <p> " Brian was ready . " It resonates . " <p> The steel-gray eyes grew wide at that . " A wonderful word ... it resonates . ' A fiction writer 's word , I 'm sure . I confess I do n't know what it means . " <p> Brian did not flinch . " It 's haunted , " he said . <p> " You mean that Joseph Jones out back ? " <p> " No , I do n't mean that . " And he looked at the wall . " It 's not a haunting . It 's more a judgment . And I do n't want to be judged . Not yet . I want to get on with what I do , be crabby about it , whatever it takes , snap at my good wife now and then , forget the things I need to forget , forget about having to measure up , forget the edge of the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be judged . " <p> " I see , " said Damon after a pause . " You do n't fancy being judged in the middle . Once a week perhaps on a Sunday , if you went to church , which of course you do n't , but if you did you could stomach that . But every day , all day , all night , you just would like to be left alone . " <p> " You seem to understand me , " said Brian . <p> " I do , " said Damon , " quite thoroughly . And yet I confess a small confusion . Who is it you think is judging you since , of course , you do n't believe in God ? " <p> " I can not answer that , " said Brian . <p> " It could hardly be better put , " said Damon . He turned to Alice . " And what about you , my dear ? " he said . <p> She looked abashed . <p> " Speak up , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " I do n't mind it there . " <p> " It ? You mean the holiness ? " <p> She nodded faintly . " But I want to keep my marriage safe . More than anything else I know . " <p> " And you think the holy endangers it ? " <p> She nodded again . " I guess that 's it . It 's the way he feels . <p> I guess that 's it . " She looked at Brian with tears in her eyes . <p> He took her hand . <p> " Let me ask you this : do you plan to live there the rest of your lives ? " <p> " Who knows ? " said Brian . <p> " We hope to , " said Alice . <p> Damon swiveled a bit , drumming the tips of his fingers together . " You 're making a big mistake , " he said . " You 've got a property that 's fully protected . As much as any place can be . Better than any insurance you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got the grace as long as you live there . And you want to give that protection up ? " <p> " I do , " said Brian , " with all my heart . " <p> Damon flipped a paper clip and caught it . " Well , then , you 've got it . Or , I should say , you have n't got it . Shall we leave right now ? Just give me a moment to find my book . Why do n't you wait in your car ? " he said . " I 'll be along in just a minute . " <p> They went outside and sat in the car . " I think he 's kind of cute , " said Alice . <p> " Cute ? " he said . " I 'd call him about as slick as they come . " <p> She looked concerned . " If that 's what he is  --  if that 's all he is , do you think he can do it ? " <p> " We 'll see , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Alice . <p> After some ten minutes or so they saw him sail from the side of the church . He was wearing a black cassock down to his heels and over his arm a long black cape  --  the hood of it swept the tips of the grass  --  and over the bush of his reddish locks a strange black hat like a sort of tam defiantly set with a black pompom . <p> " Here comes our exorcist , " said Brian . <p> " My goodness , " said Alice , " he 's going to do it right . " <p> He waved to them , jumped into a battered green Toyota , and sped away from them down the street . " Of course he knows the way , " said Alice . <p> He was already there when they arrived , paying his last respects to the graves . They saw that he had donned his cape . " Well , well , " he said , when he saw them approach , " I see what you mean . It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of that . But a little unconsecrated dirt will put the place to rights again . The bishop might even bear the expense . I ca n't commit him . He 's rather close . But in fact , he has a discretionary fund , which is fatter , I think , than he cares to tell . I 'll approach him when his asthma is right . " <p> He teetered on the clods of earth , and once he tripped on the honeysuckle and knocked his hat a little askew . But he righted himself and made his way to Joseph Jones . He stood for a time in silence before him . His head was bowed . <p> " Poor old bastard , " he said at last . He turned to Brian . " That 's a term of affection . He was a bastard . I looked him up . He 'd probably been shunted from pillar to post . He was captured by pirates and taken to sea , and now at the end he craves to remain in one peaceful spot till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've read his inscription . I honor his wish . Even the gravediggers honored his wish . " He sighed a little and crossed himself . " I grew to be very fond of Joseph . Because of him I did n't go through with deconsecration . I could n't leave him high and dry . Surrounded by possible godlessness . " He glanced at Brian from under his hat . <p> He cleared his throat . " Did you have a use for this spot of earth ? The site of a bramble bush perhaps ? Or one of those blooming althea things that never know when it 's time to quit ? " <p> Alice spoke up . " Oh , no , I think he should stay where he is . He gets in my dreams , but I do n't mind . " She hesitated . " Do you think you could deconsecrate , well , everything else , but leave his grave the way it is ? " <p> Damon nodded . " A brilliant solution , one I was going to suggest myself . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For it seems he has purchased the bones of Jones and what little ground they occupy . If he feels his fiction career will suffer ... I mean to say , he may want the whole thing totally sterile . He may be concerned that a few feet of holiness could spread . A heavy rain could redistribute the soil a bit . When he walks in the garden after that , in spots he might feel a twinge of judgment . However , " he said , setting his hat to rights , " I could indeed petition containment . " He sighed and looked again at the grave . " But He does n't , you know , always answer my prayers . " <p> " That will be satisfactory , " said Brian . " I 'm willing to compromise on that . " <p> " Splendid ! " said Damon . " And I in turn will commit you to nothing . No compact with the Divine , of course . I shall leave you totally outside the fold . " <p> " Thank you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , "  --  he turned to Alice  --  " do you wish to remain outside the fold ? " <p> " I wish to remain with my husband , " she said . <p> " A most courageous stand , " said Damon . " A course not every wife could choose . " <p> After that he turned and went round to the front . They followed him at a little distance . Clouds were massing overhead . At the door he shrugged out of his cape . He drew from the generous folds of his cassock a strip of black cloth that looked like a ribbon , with which he proceeded to yoke himself . He drew out a book whose covers were red . Then he removed his hat and turned . " You may join me , of course . I 'm just presuming you prefer to wait . " <p> " We do , " said Brian . He took Alice 's hand . <p> Damon opened the door and went inside . <p> " Do you think it 's going to work ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we think it will , it will . " <p> " That may be what it comes to , " he said . <p> A little wind blew up in the pines . A little thunder roared in the east . " I hope he gets through before it rains .... I feel so sorry for Joseph , " she said . " I just may cry . It 's all so sad . " In a moment she asked , " Do we tip him , Brian ? " <p> " Of course not , " he said . " It 's part of his job . And he should have done it before he left . " <p> " Still , he 's come such a lot of miles . " The drops at once began to fall . She cut and ran round to the back of the house . She returned with a bulging paper sack and stood with it while it spotted with rain . He did not want to know what it was . <p> " You think we might stand in the foyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in strings . " This is the very best suit I own . " <p> " No ! " he said . " It might put a crimp in his operation . I want him to do the whole damn place . Go sit in the car . " <p> But she would n't desert . She stood her ground . " I guess the graves are filling up . " <p> " Alice , you say the damnedest things . " <p> When Damon emerged at last , she pressed upon him the sodden bag . " This is a jar of my quince preserve . It was made while the house was ... the way you left it . " <p> Brian groaned within . <p> " Thank you , my dear . I shall eat it without the slightest qualm . " He took it and restored the hat to his head . <p> Brian gestured toward the house . " Is it clean ? " he asked . <p> " Clean ? " said Damon , enduring the rain . " Well , it 's open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his minions . You 're going to have to keep careful watch . " <p> Brian smiled . " You bet , " he said . " And thank you , sir . " <p> " I mean it , " said Damon . " Be on your guard . " And he tipped his hat , got into the car , waved to them once , and drove away . <p> " I wish he had n't said that , " said Alice . <p> " Nonsense , " said Brian . " He 's ribbing us . Come out of the rain . " <p> " I do n't think he was . " <p> He put his arms around her then . " Do n't tell me you believe in the devil . " <p> " Of course I do n't . But I think he does . " <p> They walked inside . The rain was clattering overhead as if the typist were on the roof . <p> " It does n't look any different , " she said . " But it feels so ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it 's safe ? " <p> <p> By HELEN NORRIS <p>
