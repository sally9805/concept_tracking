<p> Somewhere , deep within Mira Nair 's " The Perez Family " is a lovely little story waiting to be told . <p> And that 's only part of the disappointment with this engaging tale of love , hope , dreams and starting over . <p> The big problem with " The Perez Family , " a story about Cuban immigrants , is that the filmmakers decided to cast white actors in the major roles . By doing so , not only has the Samuel Goldwyn Co. robbed the film of its integrity , but the studio also has taken a giant step back to the days when white actors were painted brown and black to portray Africans in the Tarzan movies . The practice was racist then and it 's racist now . <p> And worst , Goldwyn 's marketing people make the incredible excuse that the reason whites were cast in the lead parts was because the studio wanted the movie to be less " ethnic " and more " mainstream " so it allegedly would appeal to a wider audience . <p> You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful " My Family " to know that Goldwyn , like the emperor , is wearing no clothes . <p> " The Perez Family " is based on the novel by Christine Bell . It tells the story of Juan Raul Perez ( Alfred Molina ) , a political prisoner in Castro 's Cuba who dreams of once again being with his wife , the aristocratic Carmela ( Anjelica Huston ) , who has immigrated to Miami with their daughter , Teresa ( Trini Alvarado ) . <p> Juan is released as part of Castro 's boatlift from Mariel to America of what the regime deemed to be " undesirables " mostly prostitutes , political prisoners and the elderly . <p> He meets the spirited Dottie ( Marisa Tomei ) on the boat trip to the United States and they embark on a mutual journey of survival . <p> Meanwhile , Carmela , anxiously awaiting her husband 's arrival , has become infatuated with a police officer , John Pirelli ( Chazz Palminteri ) . <p> But once in America , husband and wife remain separated through miscommunication and bad timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that she 's abandoned him . And Carmela 's hustler of a brother , who has a dislike for all boat people , does everything in his power to keep Juan and Carmela apart . <p> Dottie , herself a hustler and a survivor , convinces naturalization officials that she and Juan are married . This way , they 'll have an easier time of finding someone to sponsor them in the United States . She adds a " son " and a " father " and soon the newly formed Perez family has a home and jobs selling flowers on the boulevard . <p> At its heart , " The Perez Family " is a love story , romance that works out in the end for everyone . But getting there is like slogging through a sugar cane field during a storm in your bare feet : The pacing is tedious at times ; the dialogue strays . <p> Molina is touching as Juan , bringing a depth and soul to a tortured man . Palminteri is charming as the courting cop , and Huston is a coquettish matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad accent ( " you " comes out " jew " ) and an interpretation of Cuban culture that seems to originate with old Carmen Miranda movies . She is somewhat over the top with her stereotypical prances , and the crotch-grabbing should be offensive to all women Cuban or American . But through it all , she maintains her spirit and freshness . <p> Alvarado adds sweet support as Teresa and look for Celia Cruz , the queen of Afro-Cuban jazz , in a small role as an immigrant who befriends Dottie and Juan . <p> Nair ( " Mississippi Masala , " " Salaam Bombay ! " ) seems somewhat tentative in her direction of the screenplay by Robin Swicord , as though struggling with the subject matter . Where she excels is in delivering tender interplays between mother and daughter ( Carmela and Teresa ) and husband and wife . <p> There 's a great score by Alan Silvestri and some hot Latin sounds . Only problem : actors who do n't know a mambo from a polka . <p> " The Perez Family " is produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chiseled British actor Hugh Grant appeared on the scene , American women were beginning to feel a little Bruce Willised out . <p> " Four Weddings and a Funeral , " starring Grant , showed the return of a particular kind of romantic lead : the bashful , but charming gentleman . <p> Knowing a good thing when he sees it , writer-director Chris Monger has transplanted Grant 's Mr. Nice Guy to foggy Wales in 1917 . <p> Two English map makers drive into a sleepy village and rent a room at the town 's only inn . They 've come to measure Ffynnon Garw , a mountain much prized by the local community . <p> But the beloved landmark , which bears the same name as the town , does n't match up . It 's only 984 feet tall . So Reginald Anson ( Grant ) and his boss ( Ian McNeice ) inform the citizens their landmark is 16 feet too short . It 's only a hill , and so it ca n't appear on any official government map . <p> The proud townsfolk are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goat ( Colm Meaney ) , and the strait-laced Rev. Jones ( Kenneth Griffith ) , a plot is hatched : They will trap the unwitting Englishmen in town until they can find a way for their mountain to gain its place in history . <p> The villagers , whose names include descriptions of their jobs or personalities , pull out every stop to keep the guests around . Williams the Petroleum dismantles their engine . Thomas the Trains plays havoc with the railway schedules . <p> Finally , the conniving Morgan sends for Betty of Cardiff ( Tara Fitzgerald ) , a sexy country girl with a wicked gleam in her eye . <p> " The Englishman Who ... " is a sweet , but lightweight comedy from Miramax , reminiscent of British movies of the 1940s and ' 50s that were filled to the brim with well-meaning eccentrics . <p> This nostalgic , gentle look at a tight-knit mining town has a great cast and several very funny moments . But the sum of all these good parts just does n't add up to a memorable , must-see movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 99-minute feature , and the saccharin cuteness is a little too thick . <p> Grant is natural as the shy idealist who grows fond of his surroundings . But his stammering , befuddled Englishman is a carbon copy of his role in " Four Weddings . " And the blinking , wincing persona is so overdone at times , you begin to question its authenticity . <p> Fitzgerald is impressive as the vulnerable beauty who longs to leave her small , constricted life . And the film is brightened by the battle of wills between the pompous preacher and the promiscuous innkeeper who is so obsessed with sex he declares " maps are the undergarments of a country . " <p> It 's a nice turn from Meaney whose building a fine body of work alongside his roles in TV 's " Star Trek : The Next Generation " and " Deep Space Nine . " <p> The isolated Welsh town is well out of the line of fire of World War I , but the horrors of trench warfare are illustrated by a moving character named Johnny Shellshocked ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real love to this fable , passed down through his family from his grandfather . And his feel for the surroundings is presented by beautiful shots of the Welsh valleys and a dramatic torchlit procession along the hillside . <p> But no amount of great landscapes can completely balance the movie 's cloying quality and slight story line . <p> The movie is produced by Sarah Curtis . The executive producers are Sally Hibbin , Robert Jones , Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein.
