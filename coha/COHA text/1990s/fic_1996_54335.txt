Like most writers , Gordon Gross is two people . But unlike most writers , Gordon Grossis literally two people : husband and wife writing team Eve Gordon and Harold Gross . " Communion " is their first story sale . <p> They currently earn their living in the computer field as consultants and troubleshooters . Harold is a professional actor and Eve does stand-up comedy . They live in a New York City apartment too small for them , their two cats , and their collection of 2,000 books . <p> MON ( Middle Of Nowhere ) spins slowly on our view screen . After four and a half years together in Stardust , we are finally here . I glance at Glim , seated in the second navnet he had jury-rigged before we left Zehabus , watching the view screen . ( an odd word , jury-rigged ; as if anyone could " rig " a jury . ) <p> I feel the warm wisp of Glim 's Telen disturb my mental wandering . <p> And they said it could n't be done , is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my own . He continues to watch the view screen , solemn and straight-faced on the outside . All this time tripping over each other physically and mentally , and his humor still takes me by surprise . <p> I smile , the comers of my mouth resisting my attempt at seriousness . My eyes widen in a telepath 's shrug . <p> Who knew ? is my reply . <p> Glim tums his head slowly to look at me . We did . <p> Yes , we did , I think to myself , and here we are , still mentally sound . You ready to go in ? I ask . <p> He glances at the view screen again , t hen leans over and touches my cheek . Our minds slide together and intertwine with the caress . Let 's get it over with , he replies . I wonder , will we be able to enjoy the physical ease with each other that we 've become accustomed to on the voyage ? Or will the telepath taboos be too strong here ? ( Gods , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought that just holding hands could be so important ? Glim leans back in his chair , and our minds slide apart as two seas separated by a rising island . <p> " Stardust to MON , " I hail the controller . Glim 's daily voice exercises may not have improved the raspy quality of my voice , but they ensure that my vocal cords do not weaken and atrophy over long voyages . <p> " MON , Mooney here , " comes the answer . <p> " Request permission to land . " <p> " Do you have your Trans-immigration request ? " <p> I transmit our files to his system . <p> " Residence petition , Institute ratings , and immunology records seem in order , " Mooney 's voice comes over the corn after a few moments . " You are on manual approach . No fancy CyberNav equip here . " No questions as to why there are two of us in a one-person scout . Or why telepaths would arrive without the pomp and circumstance of a full cruiser-class cybership . Perhaps our reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I reply . " Give me the coords . " <p> The computer blinks as it receives the data and vectors . A course appears in a luminescent web superimposed over MON on the view screen . <p> " Coming in now , half blast . " I tell him . <p> " Confirmed . See you on the ground . " <p> The landing goes relatively smoothly ( read : I did n't blow us up ) ; after all , I was a navigator before my Great , if late , Discovery . We touch down a bit on the heavy side , though . Glim shoots a sidelong smile at me . <p> It 's been better than seven years since I 've had to land anything besides you , I say . And any respectable planet has at least rudimentary CyberNav . <p> Did I say anything ? <p> You were thinking it , Glim . <p> I just thought you were making sure I was awake . <p> I power down the control chairs ' gravity nets , and we make our way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diplomat training a warrior of his blood and rank receives holding him in good stead . I could use a shower and a change of clothes after my adequate yet less than delicate landing , but there is no time . I enter the code sequence into the remote panel to the left of the hatch ; the hatch slides open . <p> A tickle of cool Telen in my mind , and a breath of air from the planet washes over us ; the hair on the back of my neck prickles as if i am charged with electricity . Outside I see the ground crew pushing a wheeled ramp out of she Control Complex over the glassine landing surface to us . <p> I guess we wo n't have to jump , I say . <p> Be nice , is Glim 's response . We knew they were small . Remember , that 's why we came . <p> I know , I say , but small does n't always mean primitive . A beat . Do n't even think it , I say , looking up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud 's reflections in the complex windows , I reach out instinctively for Glim 's hand , but my fingers close on air . A glance in his direction ; his eyes hold a sad smile . I begin to brood over our emigration to this place and our quest for a place where we can openly acknowledge our relationship . Without censure . After four and a half years shut in the Stardust , I ca n't go back to hiding my feelings for Glim . But here we are in the middle of nowhere , the restrictions of the real world slamming back into place , and I must . At least until we know that we 'll be welcomed  --  as we are . <p> The ramp connects with the side of the Stardust with a thud bringing me back to real time . We descend , Glim one step in front of me , making up for some of our height difference . Five colonists have come out of the Complex and stand at the bottom of the ramp , waiting for us . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Stardust , real forward motion seems a luxury . At the bottom we face the welcoming party , three women , one man wearing an ceo-mask , and a Calcedom . The ground crew disappears back into the Complex . Unexpectedly , the Telen twists sharply in my mind and then withdraws . <p> " Well come , " says the youngest of the three women . Youth is relative , though . She is taller than I , but shorter than Glim , dark hair threaded with gray . " I 'm Madrin , Colony Regent and Telepist . " <p> " Well met , " responds Glim , bowing slightly , palms open at his side in the traditional telepath greeting , his trained voice buoying out in rich waves . " I am Glimmer , and this is Jude . " <p> " Well met . " I make a gravelly echo of Glim and mirror the distant handshake society has imposed on telepaths out of superstition and ignorance that we telepaths have adopted out of fear and habit . As if telepaths are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control others . As if we would ever want to . As if we could link up without a Monitor anyway . I feel the odd Telen again . It does not feel like it comes from those standing in front of us . I resist the impulse to look over my shoulder . <p> Madrin smiles widely , revealing straight , white , pointed teeth . Not fully human , I note to myself , at least part Cenavish . " We are happy to have you here , " she says . " We finally have enough telepaths for a proper jury . " <p> " Not that we have a crime problem , " says one of the other women , sharply . <p> " Of course , we do n't , " soothes the third . " But with six jurors , MON can file for full emerging planetary status now . " <p> " Our other telepaths , " says Madrin , a sweep of her arm taking in the four by her side . " This is Eileen , " she says , indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , gesturing toward the other woman , " and her twin Serba . " <p> A close look at the two women reveals Kin blood . Both share the peach-colored skin and translucent hair , robbed by age of its golden hue . They are dressed differently , Eileen in an elegant blue jump suit that would look better on a younger person , Serbs in a white shirt and drab olive pants . <p> " Twins , " I say , stunned . <p> Serbs smiles warmly . " Not something you see every day , " she says . <p> " No , " I respond . Perhaps , I think to myself , we will fit in here . <p> " And this is Homar , " says Madrin , nodding toward the Calcedorn . ( Never point at a Calcedorn , my mother always said . ) <p> " Eemonchdad , " he greets us , and bows slightly . He is taller than Glim , his robe only barely revealing his thin sharp form beneath . Most speculations are of exoskeletons . But few Calcedorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional eye-stalk and one rumored , though suspect , case of an articulated claw . What could we learn if he opens his mind ? <p> We obviously are n't alone here in our search for solitude and acceptance . <p> " Habnidad , " Glim and I say in unison , returning the bow . <p> Telepathy is a yoke I bear not lightly , he says . His mind voice is heavy and harsh , discomforting to feel . Underneath it , around it , behind it , I still feel the touch of the other like a cool draft beneath a door . <p> That is understandable , responds Glim . <p> " And the last of our telepaths is Eckart , " says Madrin , waving in the direction of the masked man in her party . His skin is a patchwork of light-colored blotches on a swarthy background . I do not recognize his race . <p> " How are you ? " he asks , the mask adding a congested quality to his voice . <p> " Fine , thank you , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> " Let us show you our colony , " says Madrin , gesturing off to a small transport . It is an old model ZPR , but I resist comment . We came to be out of the mainstream , I had better start accepting all that that decision implies . <p> " We would be honored , " bows Glim , ever the diplomat . <p> In the zipper , Elleen stands to the fore and stares at Glim who sits in the bucket of the craft with Madrin . I do n't blame her for staring . Glim is a perfect blend of his mixed blood . The Japanese is reflected in the cast of his dark eyes and in his long straight , blue-black hair . He has the height and the fine build of his Zehabi mother . And his skin is flawlessly Kin . <p> Elleen has difficulty sometimes resigning herself to our age and circumstance , says Serba , coming to stand next to me at a side port . Her mind voice is feather light , a bright trill in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being twins , she explains , makes it painful for us to be too far apart physically . Also we suffer from agapoma . Meaning we do not age normally , but at an accelerated rate . <p> I 'm sorry , I say . How old are you ? <p> Sixteen Kin Standard , she says . Going on thirty-two . And you ? <p> Thirty-one Earth Standard . <p> That would make us contemporaries , at least for a short time , she laughs crinkling her eyes , and then sensing my discomfort , We are thirty-four Earth Standard . A beat . Unlike Eileen , I accept our age . There is nothing I can do about it . Unfortunately for Elleen , however , intellectual age is not accelerated . She sometimes is quite juvenile . Another beat . I , on the other hand , am always juvenile . 1 find it is best to remain young at heart , especially when one 's heart is no longer young . <p> Are you full Kin then ? I ask . I had heard that . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <p> Such delicacy , she says . It 's true Monitors born to our race dwindle to the point of extinction . Few Kin can stand to mate with our own kind . <p> Then how ? I ask . <p> How did you and Glimmer share a scout for four and a half years ? she asks in riposte . I shrug , looking away from her and out the portal next to me , not yet wanting to broach that particular subject and possible rejection . <p> " Look , " says Serba aloud , pointing below the zipper . " There is the Pool . " <p> Beneath us , a body of water lies nest led in the countryside . Its silvery surface only slightly rippled by the children and adults playing around its edges . Two zippers equally as aged as this one rest in a cleared area . The window of the zipper reflects our faces over the picnic scenes below . Mine , basic black , straight horn Mohan , Earth 's first colony , next to Serba 's flawless peach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must , its color is lost in the darkness of my skin . Although I have the coloring and some Mohanish features  --  broad nose , wide lips , kinky hair  --  I am too thin to be considered attractive by Mohanish standards . I do not have the wide hips and big breasts so celebrated in our literature and media . Looking at Serba , I see my build could have come to me with the telepathy in the elusive blood of the Kin . I do not know . <p> " The ' Pool ' ? " <p> " It seems to be some sort of gateway to the Ellysians , " she says . <p> " Gateway ? I thought the Ellysians were either long dead or visitors long gone from MON . Were n't they only survived by a handful of artifacts , not even any buildings ? " I turn my head to look back at the Pool and see a flash of orange and black and white . Fluid for a moment . Then it 's gone . <p> " True . Personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply explorers , but that they now live a strictly spiritual existence . An existence we can contact through the Pool . " <p> " Oh please , " Eileen jumps in . " Do n't start that mystic Cranterism . The Pool simply induces some form of narcopathic response in telepaths . It 's probably what destroyed the Ellysians in the first place . " <p> Madrin intercedes as Serba blushes purple at her sister . " There is n't much for a telepath to do here , " she says , pointedly eyeing the twins , " except discuss some of our planet 's more interesting aspects . I hope that Glimmer and you will join us in such mental acrobatics . " <p> " Acrobatics of any sort would be welcome after so long traveling in a scout , " Glim chimes in , quickly ending the conversation with a well-placed banality that requires no response . <p> " Glim has had Diplomat training , " I offer Serbs after a bit and after Elleen settles back into her hungry stare . Damn Glim if he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she responds . " And you ? " <p> " No , I was a navigator before Discovery . " <p> " A navigator ? " <p> " I was twenty-two before the telepathy exhibited itself . " <p> " A PAT-Ey . They say the late ones are the strongest , " she says . I shrug my shoulders , suppressing a shudder at the old moniker . Post-Adolescent Telepathic Emergence . It was amazing how even telepaths can be so cruel in a school environment . I was a PAT-E cake , the men Beef PAT-Es . The teasing I took in the high school showers was preferable even when it became apparent that my breasts and hips would never achieve the Mohanish ideal . Children can be forgiven , but even the weakest Tel-child knows when they are hurting someone . " How did you meet Glimmer ? " <p> " At the beginning of my second year as a juror , " I say . " On Zehabus , Halbus II sector . It was a slander suit . It took forty-two days to decide the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredulously . <p> " The plaintiff was very . . . unlikable , " I explain . <p> " And you say Glimmer is the one who has Diplomat training ? " <p> " The trial proved to be a learning experience , " I reply . Most of my cases until that point had been violent crimes , ones where opinion and perception played an inconsequential role . <p> " So how did the two of you survive your voyage without killing each other ? " <p> I look away from her again . Glim is in deep conversation with Madrin . When I face Serba again , she is still watching me . <p> How is it possible for you and Eileen to be full Kin if your Monitors are extinct ? I try to head off the questions about Glim and me . Have you perfected disrupter fields ? <p> Diplomacy forgotten , she takes the direct route , she laughs . Our Monitors are rare , not extinct . And disrupters are not yet . . . effective for the Kin despite the hope that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is static . You would say , non-telepathic . A well-adjusted man , despite his handicap . A Monitor was n't necessary to protect roy parents during , uh , physical contact . <p> Oh . I can think of no other response . Monitors are an important part of most telepaths ' lives . They can dampen or amplify other telepaths ' abilities , weave together several telepaths ' abilities , or even break into a shielded mind , should it be necessary . <p> What does a race do if it can no longer touch ? As long as the sentient universe has been aware of the Kin , the race 's population , though extraordinarily long-lived , has been dwindling . Non-related Kin can barely stand in the same room together ; their aversion to physical contact with their own kind is legendary . <p> Telepaths of other races avoid physical contact with each other for more concrete reasons . Glim and I are the only case I know of where simple telepaths do n't go mad or into psychic shock when they meld without benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kin anytime soon , though . The " static " population makes up the majority of the universe ; for the time being , at least . What about the Calcedorn ? <p> Homar ? she asks . It may be Kin blood . At the look in my eyes , she crinkles her own and continues , Nor like that . Two or three centuries ago the Calcedorns were playing with genetic engineering . They asked for Kin samples . It could be that or their race could be starting to spontaneously produce its own telepaths . I have n't heard of any besides Homar though . <p> Eckart , she continues without any prompting from me , is actually from Earth . <p> Earth ? I echo , shocked . <p> It 's not impossible to get to Earth , Serba says , although the xenophobia does make it . . . trying . <p> " Trying ? " I say . <p> She smiles . Okay , dangerous for an alien . Although a Kin can pass . It 's clear that Eckart 's got Kin blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin discoloration as well as some other over-sensitivities to the environment . Bluntly , it 's not something he can easily hide on Earth . I suppose it was easier to leave than stay . <p> Is that why you and Eileen are , here ? <p> We are all misfits here of one sort or another . What about you and Glimmer ? What brings you to our backwater ? <p> The usual reasons , I say . <p> The usual reasons , my foot , she replies . Please , I may be a genetic abomination , but that does n't make me an idiot . The odds of two non-Tels surviving that long together on a scout are astronomical ; the odds of two telepaths doing it are incalculable . <p> I do not respond , but I can see the momentary glint of  --  what ? comprehension , disapproval , revulsion ? Then it is hidden . Serba appears to be an accomplished diplomat herself . <p> I turn to watch Madrin refereeing a match of mind wrestling between Glim and Eckart . Ah , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breathing deeply . I do n't like her sniffing at Glim like he 's a cake in a bakery . <p> Glim shouts out " Three five nine . " By the look on Eckart 's face I can guess that Glim had successfully gotten the number out from behind his shield . Madrin awards Glim the point . It brings back memories of training . <p> I was serving as Assistant Navigator on the VanderTol , a luxury goods frigate , the first year of my second three-year contract . Very soon after I made the Great Discovery ( " Captain , I think I 'm telepathic " ) , I was dropped at the Institute on Zehabus , not because it was the best , although it was , but because it was the next stop on the ship 's route . <p> I was officially Tested and officially Confirmed . My career as a navigator was legally terminated , my contract paid off by the Institute , and my life as a telepath begun . <p> The course work was straightforward . Learn to control your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts to yourself . Weeks of moot court . Memorize the rules . <p> Telepaths must spend no less than four , but no more than twenty years serving as jurors , travel time not included , in a Court certified by the Interplanetary Department of Justice . Of course , the alternative was permanent observation and control by the IDJ in a location convenient for them , generally in one of their detention centers . <p> Three months after Discovery , I was a juror . <p> The zipper , having left the Pool behind , flies over the main colony . It is a small one . Four buildings clustered around a village green are all that is visible from the zipper . <p> " Most of the colony is beneath the green , " Serba explains . <p> " Did n't they learn from Earth that people were n't meant to live underground ? " <p> " They do n't stay there , " she replies . " There are crops to be cared for and business to attend to , not to mention all the festivals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Farming ? " I ask . <p> " Yes , " she responds , " the fields are over there . The colony actually extends under the more delicate crops so that the radiated heat will protect them at night . " She points to the other side of the zipper . Through the window , I can make out the patchwork of distant fields and one above-ground building . " Livestock is kept on the other side of the fields . It cuts down on the smell . " <p> A small way from the main colony , perhaps a thirty-minute walk , is the Justice building , an elegant name for a simple one-story granite structure and the central body of authority on MON . From here , blocked only by a thin line of trees , I see the few above-ground colony structures and the beginning of the fields . The oh-so-mysterious Pool that sparked Elleen and Serbs is a shimmer in the distance . Further yet , and getting farther behind every moment , is what has been home for the last four plus years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building L feel just a hit exposed standing beside the zipper . Getting inside will be welcome . <p> We walk toward the oversized doors , oddly ornate in contrast with the plain facade . Eckart walks up to pace with me . " What do you think ? " <p> " They 're intriguing . " I momentarily halt my rush toward the safety of the building to study them more closely . " I recognize many of the symbols and stories , but not all . They 're very well carved . " Eckart smiles and starts inside the building , <p> " You just made his day . They were his project , " Madrin whispers to me as she passes into the building . I suppose being stuck inside so often gave Eckart time to pursue other talents . With a final appreciative glance I enter the sheltering waifs of the Justice building : <p> Inside of the structure in the back , there is bench seating for witnesses and spectators . At the front are the Judge 's and Jury 's boxes . Facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply wrought ; the structure seems cool without being cold . The piercing gaze of Lady Justice presides over the room from behind the judge 's box . <p> " You 'll be spending little of your time here , " starts Madrin , " but it is the center of MON Justice . We also house the Ellysian artifacts here  --  what few we have . More immediately , though , I am sure you wish to rest . Out this way are the Telepath cottages . " She starts out of the hall and leads us to a back door that is far less impressive than where we entered . <p> The clean air of MON wraps me again . For a moment the odd Telen tickles my mind . I turn to Glim but he is not sending to me , and no one else is being obvious about it . My shield may be a bit weak ; after all Glim and I did n't need to use shields all that much over the last four years . In the distance is a copse of orange-leafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the rest of the Tels allowing Glim and me a chance to absorb the scenery . <p> The housing for the telepaths is another twenty-minute walk beyond the Justice building just the other side of the trees . At present , there are six aboveground cottages , a powerful example of the separate but equal treatment that telepaths often receive at the hands of non-Tels . Each is positioned to afford privacy , but all within sight of each other . <p> Madrin goes with Glim , and Serbs escorts me to my cottage . Perhaps Serbs is not the only one who is unaware of our reputation . <p> Serbs , I send . <p> Yes ? <p> Why are the telepaths housed aboveground if the non-Tel population is housed below it ? I ask . <p> We would have little reason to come aboveground otherwise , she replies . Elleen was right in her statement that crime is no problem here . <p> Oh , I say , not convinced , but it 's a better party line than I 've heard in the past . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Zehabus would have called it crowded . The structure is made of a material that I am sure is not indigenous to MON , but is made to look like natural wood and mud . A cotton batting mattress in the bedroom on a platform bed , a small kitchen complete with foodporter , a bath area with a huge sunken bath , a living area with a small fireplace , a compact workspace with Plex-Link(R) . Not bad for a start-up colony . <p> Glim comes to me after Serbs leaves . <p> At least there 's indoor plumbing , I say . <p> You are incorrigible , he says , the feel of his Telen warming me . So little time apart and I have missed our contact already . <p> I was trained to expect technology , I remind him . <p> As I was raised to expect luxury , he replies . <p> Touche . <p> Did you see the Pool ? <p> Yes . Serba says she thinks it 's a gateway to the Ellysians . Elleen , however , disagrees . <p> I seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Serba says she thinks that they are the planet 's aborigines . <p> Interesting , says Glim . Then , Madrin says that the crew will off-load our belongings and revive Tikki from stasis . They should bring our things by later today . The thought of Tikki , my gen-cat , back underfoot brings a smile to my face . <p> Why do n't you get a shower in the meantime , Glim says . He knows me too well . <p> I 'll do that . <p> Come by when you 're done , he says . Perhaps I can give you reason for another one . <p> A bath , a real bath in real water , the first in too many years , is the first genuine straightforward pleasure for me on MON . I rub in lotion and let the air dry the excess moisture off me . The light floral scent of the lotion is unusual , most likely indigenous , definitely new , to me . Looking in the full-length mirror in the bathing area , I see that regular exercise has helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four years without sun has not lightened the color of my skin . The even ebony glistens darkly with oil and water in the slightly bluet light of MON 's unfamiliar sun . <p> There is a brightly colored cotton-like robe hanging in the closet of the sleeping area . I put it on when my skin is dry and walk barefoot toward Glim 's cottage . The ground is soft and slightly damp against the soles of my feet . The grass is a dark blue-green , and it 's dotted with small turquoise flowers . <p> Out under the sky , that cool whip of Telen flutters again . It seems to come from the direction of the main colony , but when I turn to look in that direction , the touch shifts . I concentrate , listening carefully , but I can discern no meaning just a slight pull , a caress , a whisper , a kiss . Either someone skilled is playing this game or I am losing my touch . Normally I can immediately sense direction from a touch . I close my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , try to resolve its meaning and direction . <p> While I am circling slowly , trying to get a fix on the mind touch , Glim comes up behind me . <p> Do you feel it ? I ask . <p> Yes . <p> Where is it coming from ? I ask , turning to face him . <p> He shrugs . <p> What is it saying ? Can you understand it ? <p> No , he says . <p> Do they have a Monitor here ? I ask . <p> No , he replies . According to Madrin , they have n't been able to afford that status . <p> Then what is it ? I ask . <p> Glim shakes his head . I do n't know . <p> What does it mean ? <p> I do n't know , Jude . That 's all I can say . He pounds that last thought into my mind with a bit more fervor than necessary . <p> Okay , I apologize . Sony . I reach down and pick one of the tiny blue flowers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up for Glim to smell . <p> Nice , he says , noncommittal . I can tell the unidentified Telen is irritating him . Young Monitors often play this sort of game , a sort of mental ventriloquism , before they mature and are trained . Maybe MaN has birthed its own Monitor . <p> If mental arts are not wholly welcome here , a child could learn to hide its gift for quite some time . This is t rue especially if the parents are aware and helping with the deceit . While such deceit is a crime , few can blame parents for not wanting to send their children away at so young an age . <p> Cueing from Glim 's tension , I decide to occupy him rather than pursue the source of the Telen . This place reminds me of Mohan , I say . Of course , Mohan has a lot more people . And they 're all dark . <p> Not to mention that they have CyberNav equipment , Glim chips in . <p> I was n't actually going to mention it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit , it is beautiful here . And they certainly went out of their way to provide telepaths with privacy . Glim nods . Do n't you like it ? <p> It 's different , he answers . <p> Different ? I say . <p> Kelgar is a desert planet , he reminds me . <p> I forgot . Ive never seen his home planet ; as much as I try , I can not picture an entire planet that is a desert . Only the very rich would choose to live on such a planet . Kelgar is so exclusive , so sparsely populated , that it does n't even have its own Court , but shares one of Zehabus ' . It is a constant source of teasing that he never learned how to swim . Maybe now I will have the time to make good on my threat to teach him . The Pool seems a perfect place to try . I , of course , will then have to get over my fear of stepping on living , green , slimy things in natural ponds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your cottage , I ask after a while . <p> The same as yours , he replies . <p> Is there a damper ? I ask . I did n't think to check my place . <p> Yes . And I see a little fire light up behind his eyes . The switch is by the bed . <p> Ooo , I say . Let 's go try it out . <p> Why is it that when we touch , we do not go insane except with pleasure , neither of us is subsumed by the personality of the other , and our minds like our bodies fit together with the ease of two puzzle pieces ? Why do n't the telepists know how to do this ? <p> It 's a good thing we had a ' lectro-Monitor or you would have deafened half the colony , I jibe Glim . Of course the scratches on his back and ass did n't appear quietly either . <p> It was certainly interesting to have room to move around in again .

But I better get back to my cottage before we get caught . Do n't want to risk alienating ourselves in the first few hours . <p> You do n't think they 'd buy the fact that you were just giving me a massage ? I send him a few choice images of what I can massage for him and how before he groans and begs exhaustion . Okay , you 're right , Jude . I just do n't want to lose what we had on the ship . I ca n't go back to hiding all the time . <p> Another evening like this and I do n't think we 'll have a choice . We really do have to remember we have neighbors now ! I slip out of our wet embrace and put on the robe . Glim turns off the damper field , and we are thrown into shadowy dusk as the field 's soft yellow glow fades .

" <p> " As if you did n't notice Elleen on the zipper . Or was that Elleen noticing your zipper ! You , with your archaic throwback fashions . " <p> " A bit territorial , are n't we ? Now why would I give up what we have for just some simple Kin-ship ? " <p> I fall back to the bed , laughing at his abysmal pun . It is difficult to get used to being around people again . The Stardust was a closed but complete society . A community of two . And we still have an infinite amount of space to explore in each other 's minds . <p> Serba understated the situation when she said there is n't a lot for a telepath to do on MON . It 's no wonder Eckart had time to work on his magnificent doors . Three days . I am unpacked , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not off ridding the planet of small game , is busy running under my feet . And the wild Telen never seems totally absent from my mind unless I 'm in a damping field . I can not otherwise shield against it . <p> It may be growing stronger , but it sends no message that I can decipher . Several times I have found myself walking toward the main colony , unthinkingly , and have stopped myself . The compulsion makes me nervous . <p> Glim seems similarly affected . Madrin says the others felt the same touch for a time after they first arrived and then less and less frequently until it disappeared altogether . Apparently this is the source of the controversy with the Pool . There are many documented phenomena that can cause false Telen , but none ever documented as consistently as this without a satisfactory explanation . Unfortunately , since MON really is in the middle of nowhere ( in a physical sense ) , the phenomenon has n't been vigorously pursued after the original , inconclusive , investigation dead-ended several years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his broadsword in the open area just beyond cottages . The only sounds are his occasional grunts and the elusive avian life of MON which Tikki keeps at bay . I need some distraction as well . Glim ca n't possibly occupy me all the time . Not that we have n't tried . While there have been some " contact " events at the Pool arranged by Serba , we have politely declined to join for the time being . Though it might give me an excuse to get Glim near an open body of water at least , I 'm not quite up to swimming lessons myself yet . <p> So far , no one has said anything to us about the time Glim and I spend together , and I assume that the damper keeps the full nature of our relationship solely between the two of us , but one never knows . It 's better not to push too far too soon . <p> Serba , I call out . <p> You rang , comes her reply . <p> What is there to do ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> Am not  --  echoes Elleen 's grating Telen . <p> Homar is molting and ca n't go out , and Eckart 's got a problem with the pollen . So we do n't have any contact plans . <p> You ca n't tell me that there 's nothing to do , I protest . <p> Harvest , she says . That 's it . <p> Can I help ? <p> You do n't have to , she says . <p> I want to . My belly-button has been over-contemplated . <p> What ? <p> Sorry . An old philosophy joke . I 'm bored . <p> Okay . I can call Madrin . Maybe , I 'll join you . <p> Thank you . <p> I put on a loose-fitting wearall and hoots while I wait for Serba . I rinse my mouth with water . I splash cold water on my face , and sit outside and let the sun dry it . <p> Madrin will send a zipper as soon as one is available . <p> Thank you , Serba . It just seems that there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bored on Stardust , but here . . . <p> You 'll adjust . Serba comes around the comer . " Do you mind if we talk ? " <p> " No . Something wrong ? " <p> " I just do n't want Eileen to overhear us . Another drawback to being twins is that it is very hard to close the other out of our thoughts when speaking telepathically . If we used the ' lectro-Mon she would feel the wall like a headache . This is the most . . . diplomatic way to handle it . " The smile while she simultaneously crosses her eyes is not convincing . <p> " Is there a problem between you two ? " <p> " Not between us really . I know you noticed her fascination with Glim as I did . Remember , I told you she is young in mind if not in body . I think your relationship with Glim has her a bit jealous . Even if she knows she could n't handle any physical contact . Somehow she thinks if you can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Trying to play dumb as a telepath requires infinitely more finesse than as a non-Tel . It is also incredibly foolish with your peers . " Is it that obvious ? " <p> " The facts are , but the explanation is n't . How do you two survive it ? I mean , with a Monitor it is usually doable , in a rather public sort of way for your species , but without . . . How do you protect each other ? " <p> " We do n't . We just let it happen . " <p> " You allow each other in completely ? Without any protection ? Without even a disrupter ? " <p> " Yes . " It is the truth between Glim and me . Absolutely no barriers when we are in contact . <p> " What . . . " <p> " What is it like ? " <p> " Well , yes . I mean , I know it 's none of my business , but . . . yes . " <p> I start to laugh and Tikki tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in the process . Soon she and I are one large mass of sentient protein . Out of breath , I finally pin Tikki by her shoulders and she playfully concedes defeat by throwing her paws out over her head . She opens her mouth and lolls her tongue out to one side . <p> " That felt so good . " <p> " Nothing like a good wrestle , " Serba stands up and gestures toward the Justice building . I let Tikki go , and walk with Serba , the gen-cat bounding in wide circles about us . " Where did you get such a wonderful gen-cat ? " <p> " She was a gift from my parents . I think they were worried I would be alone the rest of my life after I . . . after I was Discovered . It must have cost them a year 's salary . I guess they felt guilty for birthing me . " <p> " That 's awful . " <p> " I do n't mean it that way . I do n't blame them . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came with little choice . But I think they have their doubts . Anyway , that 's not what I meant . I meant it felt good to talk about Glim and me . And I do n't mind you asking . I have n't been able to talk to anyone about it ever . Before we left Zchabus , we were rather avoided . Even my best friends would n't talk about it . I think the Institute suggested the transfer to MON just to keep things calm . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So ? Oh , what 's it like ? It 's like , well , taking a warm bath that hugs back . It flows through you and fills you . It 's like you 've turned inside out and you 're both part of this incredible organism that 's both of us individually but also something wonderfully more . It 's . . . indescribable . Here , " I send her the imagery and emotion that flood me every time Glim and I make love . It is n't perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderment that Glim and I share , but it leaves Serba stunned and blushing . <p> " For something you ca n't share , you 've certainly ripped back the curtain . " <p> " So , what do you tell Eileen ? " <p> " The truth , as if I had a choice . I just hope she lets it go . What you and Glim have sounds . . . unmatchable . At least once you get past the concept of two Tels touching , especially in that way . I wonder what makes you two so different ? " <p> " I have no idea , I 'm only glad we are : " <p> The zipper pulls up and we board in silent camaraderie . Watching Serba 's back as she walks up the entry , I smile . <p> Outside , the sun is shining but the temperature is still pleasant in the shade . I sit down on the bench beside my front door . After a short time ( does n't anyone keep track of time on this planet ? ) , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking forward to being in the fields again today . The work is satisfying and , besides , there is n't a whole lot else to do . Especially since I need to leave Glim a little recovery time . <p> The few MONeans I 've met are pleasant but reserved around me . Whether it 's my newness or my Tel status that holds them at bay I can not yet say . No one is hostile though in thought or deed . Even a non-Tel can pick up strong emotions , observation being a large part of anyone 's ability to understand those around them . Tels just have the capacity to confirm and get detail . <p> Tikki comes trotting up from the field and insinuates herself between my feet . <p> A light breeze whistles over my cottage , and I hum along with it tunelessly . I take one step toward Glim 's cottage , and immediately trip over Tikki , who jumps on me , purring , as soon as I 'm on the ground . I wrestle her off me and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear open for the zipper as I go . The grass brushing against my boots as I walk and Tikki 's purr are all I allow to announce my approach and possible ambush . <p> When I am nearly all the way to Glim 's place , I can hear the cut of his broadsword through the air , his voice counting . I walk around his cottage and see him before he senses me and turns . He is covered with sweat , wearing only a pair of shorts . I smile . Tikki storms him , sword play being one of her favorite games , but he throws the sword down before she reaches him , Tikki goes and sits by the sword , attention divided between it and Glim . <p> I thought you were going to help with the harvest , he says , ignoring Tikki . <p> If the zipper ever comes . <p> Always so impatient , he says . <p> It comes from years of having to be someplace on schedule , I respond . You 're just used to letting everything take forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> I send him a mental raspberry . You 've only been a juror for five point two six years longer than I have ; Earth-standard at that . Your problem is you 've got too much money . <p> Not anymore , he reminds me . How he can be so  --  mild  --  about it still dumbfounds me . <p> Are you sure it was worth giving up ? I ask . <p> What we have together is worth any price , he responds , walking toward me . I only wish we could live without having to hide it out here on the edge of the universe . There are places I would love to share with you . <p> But any place I am with you is perfect . I smile up at him . <p> Glim cups my face in his hands for the first time since we 've landed without the numbing edges of a damper field around us , and time seems to shift and blur . I smell his sweat mingled with the MONean flowers in an impressionistic symphony . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lips to kiss him . . . the world explodes in an orange and black and white flash of light and the screaming and I see them floating in the black and orange - two of them , they must be the Ellysians , I think  --  long hair floating behind them , androgynous in form and Glim 's mind and mine embrace and I can feel the power in the joining grow and I feel the others , Serba and Eileen and Eckart and Homar , trying to separate us with their minds and flinching from the assault and I see MON through a black veil and  --  how can the spiritual bond between Glim and me be this strong ? What has happened ? Why has it not happened before ? How could I ever give this up ? How could anyone ask me to deny it ? .  --  then Tikki is between my feet and I am falling and Glim tries to hold me but Tikki is between us , he loses touch , and the bond is broken . <p> I fall on my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purring and robbing her face against my chin . The colors are gone . The screaming has stopped . <p> What in the living hell was that ? Serba demands . <p> I look up at Glim . He is staring at his hands . <p> The others are coming , I say . Are you all right ? <p> He looks up from his hands . Are you all right ? I ask again . <p> What happened ? he asks . His question sparkles in my mind with shock and wonder . <p> I shake my head . I do n't know . Are you okay ? <p> It was so powerful , he says . Like we were fusing into one  --  <p> Are you okay ? I shoot at him , worrying about personality subsumption . <p> Yes , he says , finally . Not subsumption . Mind sex . <p> I can see the others , the Calcedorn in the lead , coming around the comer of Glim 's cottage . Tikki settles down on my chest with her paws snuggled into my neck , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin . <p> " What happened ? " demands Serba , stopping several feet from me . The others stand a little way from her . No one moves to help me shake off Tikki . I wrestle Tikki off and slowly stand up . No one attempts to help me at all . <p> " What happened ? " Serba repeats . <p> " I do n't know , " I say . " Everything was black and orange , and they were floating . " <p> I turn toward the main colony and sense that Glim follows my gaze . <p> " The Ellysians , " she says . " You saw the Ellysians . But how could you see them here ? We 've only seen them at the Pool . " <p> " You never told me you 'd seen them before . " <p> " I did n't want to influence you . It Eileen and the scientists are right , and it is simply a ' narco-pathic response to elements unknown , ' I could influence your perceptions by giving you expectations . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body . Glim may be right . Although the term does n't describe the experience itself , " mind sex " is the best description the feeling left in its wake . " You could never have suggested what we just saw and felt . " <p> " Never , " Glim chimes in . His nipples are still hard from the experience , his body flushed . He sits down quickly , knees drawn up in an effort to hide his excitement . <p> Serba , however , is too intent on me to notice or care . " What did you see ? " Her level of passion is almost fanatical . <p> " I , we , saw two beings . I did n't get a sense of male or female . They had long hair of some sort that appeared to have motion or they were in some kind of nul-grav field . There were colors : black and orange . A sense of . . . of . . . welcome ? Is that what you would call it , Glim ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , but we share all our senses when we 're joined , uh , linked mentally . " <p> Glim is actually flustered . I have never seen him off balance before . <p> " Your ' link ' was most extraordinary , " Homar interjects . His molting must not be finished ; a fine trail of particles marks the path from his cottage . I find myself musing again over the nature of his physical being . " Is this what you two normally experience during your mating process ? " <p> Thus Homar brings Glim 's and my relationship to the table , albeit in a less than tactful manner . Glim , all sign of embarrassment gone , stands to confront Homar . " I do n't believe we have invited you into our hive . " <p> Homar goes rigid for a moment , the insult stunning him . " Actually , " he answers , calmly precise , " as you have already shared your feast , we are no longer strangers on the path to your hive . " <p> Glim finally bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then allow me to show you the proper entry . " <p> " You know my people 's customs well , Glimmer . But know , too , that what has happened here today is extraordinary ; so much so that it draws me out at a time when no other , certainly no other of an alien race , may expect to see me . That being said , let us end our sparring . I think we are both vulnerable at the present moment . " Homar gestures behind him , and Glim notices for the first time the trail of the airborne particles . <p> " Very well . " <p> " So you both saw the same things , " Eckart jumps in , promptly sneezing . " I 'm sorry , I ran out without my eco-mask . " <p> " Did n't we just clear your sinuses for you ? " I look at Eckart holding his palm over his nose . I begin to giggle . <p> " This is not something to laugh about ! " Eileen is darkly flushed with rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had no right to inflict . " <p> " Calm down , Eileen , " Serba cuts off her tirade with a command . " I 'm sure it was n't intentional , and I do n't think it caused any damage , however shocking it may have been . Your problem is you 're jealous . It 's time to grow up . Worry about the welfare of the jury for once . " <p> In the distance we hear a zipper closing in on us from the direction of the main colony . As it comes over the trees I can see Madrin 's strained face in the window . Please , all of you , I will be there in a moment . I think we need to talk , calmly , about whatever just happened . <p> Glim takes this time to re-don his shirt and sheathe his sword . Simple tasks give him a sense of order and stability . On the Stardust he would wash every day in precisely the same way . Glim uses ritual to channel his emotions and energy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the food porter in a different order , juice before caffe , toppings before toast . Nor would he remark if I set them out on the table in a haphazard manner . He would simply reorder each into its customary place , touching an item at a time , lips murmuring quietly . <p> I did n't find out until the end of the voyage that the order he imposed was an integral part of the Zehabi ritual of thanksgiving . And I only found out because I asked , not because he ever called me to task for my little game of disorder . <p> The zipper lands , and Madrin walks over , gravely concentrating on our jury . I feel slightly bewildered and guilty like an adolescent after she first learns to masturbate . <p> " I think , perhaps , we should all sit . Homar , " she notes the Calcedorn 's unprecedented public appearance with no outward sign of shock , " are you comfortable enough to stay with us ? Do you need anything in your present condition to remain here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I imagine this morning 's events overshadow even the occasion of my present exposure . " <p> We follow Madrin over to a copse of MON 's percasive orangish-leafed trees . We sit in a circle with Glim and me at opposite points of a diameter . Madrin settles on a large stone . We look for all the galaxy like a troop of campers about to hear a ghost story . " We had all heard the rumor , of course , that Jude and Glim were not only gifted telepaths , but also distinctive in their interaction with each other . But we were not warned of the effect this could have on the rest of our jury . " <p> " Madrin , " Glim answers , " this has never happened before . We do try to keep our physical contact within the constraints of a damping field , but we have touched , kissed , even been intimate on the rare occasion outside of it . In the past , neither we nor nearby telepaths have had this . . . reaction . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what caused it , " I say . " But it was unexpected . Glim and I were ambushed as much as the rest of you . " <p> " That being the case , I believe a certain amount of restraint would be prudent for now . Perhaps one of you is developing into a Monitor . For all our sakes , I think , for now , you two should cease all physical contact . " <p> As Madrin pronounces her verdict , I feel my dreams shred and float away on the wind . All reason for our self-imposed exodus , all hope for the freedom to build a new life is lost . I call to Tikki and run back into my cottage . Locking the door , I draw a near-scalding bath and sink into it crying . I hear knocking at the door and feel an occasional tentative Telen , but I ignore them all and sink into my tears and mist . <p> I wake to a tapping at the door . My eyes are swollen , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , I send , putting as much bite in my Telen as I can muster . <p> Never , comes the answer , warm and soothing in my mind . Glim . Jude . <p> I can not answer . <p> Jude , please , we need to talk . I roll over onto Tikki who makes an unenthusiastic pillow ; she mewls her complaint at me , then wriggles out and off the bed . <p> Jude , I know you 're a wake . We need to talk . Things are not as bad as you think they are . Much has happened since you . . . left . Dear Glim , always the diplomat , when he is n't slicing and dicing . <p> I put on my robe , my damned MONean robe , and go to the door . <p> " What ? " I can not continue in mind speak . It only reminds me of how close we can no longer be . I stare at the slab of wood separating us and wonder how I could even go on separated permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for . Maybe we should simply take off again in Stardust and cruise around until we die . For so long I never believed someone existed with whom I could share my life , from even before Discovery . How could lever survive happily without what Glim and I have shared ? <p> " May I come in ? " <p> For a moment I really consider just going back to bed alone and curling into a little ball . But this is Glim . Our shared history is powerful . The ostracism of not only our fellow jurors , but of all telepaths on Zehabus . The threats of the planer 's most prominent anti-Tel group , SCM , Society for Closed Minds or SCuM as the Tels think of them . Four and a half standard years locked together in a cell called Stardust . The dreams of the freedom to acknowledge , publicly , our feelings lot each other . <p> I owe him more than shutting him out , even now when those dreams are lost . With or without the dream , I love him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lead him into the kitchen , and we sit at the small table across from each other . My eyes are gritty and my teeth fuzzy . Neither of us speaks . <p> Glim looks concerned and worried . I want to hold him , and my thoughts come full circle to why we 're sitting here on opposite sides of the table rather than holding each other . Finally , " So , what has been decided for us now ? " And how can we fight it ? <p> " No , it 's our decision , yours and mine . Madrin and I discussed this , rather heatedly at times , for most of the night . I do n't think she realized how strongly this would affect us . The entire jury realizes , now , how much we share . But it 's possible that we pose some kind of danger or at the very least some serious distraction , if this happens again . So we compromised . " <p> " How ? " I ask , wondering what we have lost . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced ' lectro-Mon . " <p> " Enhanced how ? " <p> Glim opens his fist and reveals a disrupter . " I 've already installed one in my cottage . This is for yours . If you agree . " <p> " But we 've never disturbed anyone when we 're under a ' lectro-Mon . Why do we need the disrupter ? " I protest . <p> " It 's the least Madrin will accept . " Glim shrugs . Intellectually , I can understand the condition . Disrupter fields are effective , and most damping fields are installed in the bedroom where they are convenient to privacy and intimacy , if not limiting to spontaneity . <p> " What else ? " <p> " Madrin will communicate with the closest Institute to notify them that she wants Test us . She thinks that one or both of us may be developing into Monitors . She is confident that the Institute will transmit any materials she needs . <p> " I have some misgivings ; she may be trained as a telepist , " Glim says , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is qualified to Test us . I guess we 'll find out . I ca n't imagine that I 'm a Monitor , though ; if I gambled , my bet would be on you . " <p> " What else ? " More testing . I 've spent more years in a school environment than anywhere else . First as a child , then a navigator , then a juror , now this . When shall I be free of tests ? <p> " We work with the others on some experiments to learn more about the Ellysians . " Glim smiles and spreads his palms . " That 's the deal . " <p> " You love to negotiate , do n't you , " I say . " It 's a good thing that it 's one of your talents . " <p> " I enjoy it most when the goals are worthy . Now , how would you like to take advantage of some of my other talents ? " <p> With Glim 's gaze on me , I become aware of how rumpled I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . There 's no telling what life forms are thriving in there . " <p> " Ever the delicate flower , " Glim laughs . " Since you 've made it so enticing , why do n't you just meet me ' neath the ' lectro-Mon ? " <p> A slow grin gets the better of me . " Deal , but I 'm not responsible for the condition of your clothes if you 're not out of them by the time I get there . " <p> In the bathroom , I rinse my mouth and wash my face . I hear a click and snap as Glim inserts the disrupter into the ' lectro-Mon . Then the rustle of his clothing . My reflection stares back at me from the mirror , eyes puffy with purplish circles under them . The last time I looked this unrested was right before we left Zehabus when Glim and I received a matched set of death threats from SCUM . That was the moment that finalized our decision to come to MON . <p> Before I was Discovered , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many lows either . Life was an even journey . <p> After Discovery , the regularity of my existence was destroyed . After three months of training and therapy with multitudinous telepists , I was thrown into the most prestigious Court system this side of the galaxy , and trapped in the middle of a juridie melodrama . Murder , armed robbery , piracy , hate crimes . For the first time in my life I wondered about the depravity of sentient life . <p> Into this mind stepped Glim . Breeding from a long line of rich on Kelgar , he seemed to resonate in my mind even during the first case that we deliberated together . When we first broke taboo and **30;971;TOOLONG , the result was electric . Never before had I anything of any account to lose . But having such a thing now , especially one as taboo as our relationship , I can not help but fear losing it . And with that fear comes the knowledge that I will pay any price to keep it . <p> Maybe living alone together in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate out the possibility of sunlight , fresh air , and unconstricted movement , a diet of love seems all we could possibly need . <p> Glim is waiting for me when I get to the bedroom . The soft yellow glow of the ' lectro-Mon bathes him and the room around him with an ethereal light . His nearly hairless chest , solid and chiseled , seems to float above the edge of the covers . <p> I go to him , stiff from last night 's protest , but needing his warmth and encouragement . I pass through the field , slipping out of the robe , reaching out with my Telen , and . . . nothing . I fall in to his arms and feel my skin against his , his lips in my hair , his penis against my thigh , but I am trapped within my own mind , I can not embrace his . <p> Like this , making love is just jamming . <p> But it 's all we have left . <p> The justice building is cool inside its granite cocoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serba leads the way , Madrin separates Glim and me in the line , and Elleen picks up the rear . Serba stops at a carved door . The sign simply says ARCHIVES . Understated for the only collection of Ellysian artifacts in the known universe . <p> Once humans joined the galactic community , they ceased their " sticky fingers " approach to archeology . Few inhabitable worlds are void of the signs of prior civilization . Humans adopted the habit of other sentient explorers , they collect artifacts into archives and museums local to their site of discovery where such can be viewed in context . The more spectacular discoveries are connected by regular touring ships . <p> Scientists and others with interest in sites off the established tours can request an information dump to gain data on smaller or private sights . If the researcher requires first-hand observations ; however , he or she has three choices : book passage on one of the cyberfrigates on the appropriate trade route ( a long and time consuming option ) ; charter a transport to the desired location ( an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight expertise ) ; or take a personal scout ( the most exorbitant option for those who can survive on their own in space ) . <p> The system , such as it is , does not engender much contact with remote locations like MON . When taking on such great expense , one would like to gamer results somewhat in proportion to the outlay . <p> Serba opens the door , and we enter a dimly lit room . A sneeze draws my attention to Eckart who sits in front of a viewing screen . " Please , shut the door quickly . The pollen is rather thick today , " he says in a nasally apologetic way while reaching for his trademark mask on the table next to him . " I 'm doing some research for my next project  --  a statue for the center Green , " he says by way of polite dismissal as he returns to the viewer . <p> On the other side of the room are several small file containers and a single display case . Inside the case , highlighted in tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What could these possibly be ? " <p> Serba looks up with a misty-eyed reverence , " We do n't know . The theories range from farming handtools to pieces of larger machinery . They were all found near the banks of the Pool or within its historical shoreline . " <p> Each piece looks as if a giant hand has twisted it into a bizarre contortion . How would the Ellysians have used them ? Did they hold them in their hands ? Did Ellysians have hands ? Every edge is rounded , and each piece mottled in color . Were the artifacts damaged in some way by some unknown cataclysm  --  or were they constructed so ? Nothing about their shapes suggests the images Glim and I saw . <p> Glim 's voice breaks my concentration , " I wonder if the Ellysians were blasted out of existence ? All of these pieces look like the leftovers of a plasma-blast . " <p> Madrin fields the question . " That has been discussed among the academics . Unfortunately , geologists ca n't find any corroborating geologic data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as originally designed . The next most common theory is that they were dropped here from the sky by some kind of vehicle . Unless we actually contact the race , we may never really know . " <p> " How you expect to communicate with a dead race is beyond me , " snipes Elleen . <p> Serba ignores her . <p> " You 'd think with all the false Telen phenomena put together with the artifacts that we 'd generate more interest , " sniffs Eckart as he joins us after all . <p> " Who is going to shell out that much currency to come here ? " is Elleen 's response . <p> Eckart puts aside his mask and blows his nose . Serba clears her throat . <p> I return to examining the objects . Our faces reflect back at me and obscure my view until I readjust my position . Displays always seem to be built for taller people . <p> Even with the different angle , I discern nothing new . No residual energy or feelings that connect them to Glim 's and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glim 's shoulders droop a bit . He looks over at me , " Nothing . You ? " <p> " Nothing , " I say , shaking my head . " Sorry , Serba . These are n't responsible . Nor do they suggest any meaning or use . " <p> " I never really expected they would . I only hoped . Perhaps we 'll learn more from the experiments next week . You should have started your tests by then as well . " And perhaps the disrupters will no longer be necessary , she sends . I shrug . Hope seems far away , given Madrin 's position . She is , after all , a telepist ; her opinion carries the weight of the Interplanetary Department of Justice behind it . <p> The sky is flawless again today . We certainly picked the right season to emigrate . The other colonists , though , tell me MON will make up for it later with rain and eventually a vicious wint or . At that point we will move into the colony proper . But today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its surroundings with an almost rippleless skin . After today 's break , the Monitor testing will continue tomorrow along with the start of the new series of experiments to contact the Ellysians . Since this will involve , at the very , least , wading in to the Pool , Glim must be introduced m swimming . <p> I watch Glim make his way slowly through the shallows , with great trepidation . He looks back at me smiling like a child , but his eyes beg me to tell him , " It 's okay , you do n't have to learn how to swim . " I smile back at him like a tolerant mother . Glim would probably capitalize the " m " in that word for doing this to him . A curious invective Glim claims comes from an old Earth colony , but he can not be sure . <p> I only wish I could be going in with him , holding him up , rather than Serba with her thick blue neoprene gloves . Serba tells me she 's a superb swimmer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've given up swimming for so long in deference to his fears . As it is , I can only shout encouragement and blandishments as the lesson progresses . <p> A zipper lands nearby . Madrin exits and comes over to me . Why ca n't she just leave us alone ? " Are you feeling any better ? " When we left Madrin and the testing yesterday , I was nearly too tired to walk . <p> " I 'm still tired ; Glim 's stamina is better than mine . He 's been after me lately about going to sleep every night instead of spending time with him . " <p> " Interesting , " she says with a hint of distaste . " Do you mind if I watch with you ? " <p> I shrug . " You 'll have to throw one negative comment for at least every three , otherwise Glim will get too cocky about his progress . " As if we would ever have to worry about encouragement from Madrin , interrogator at large . <p> " I think I will remain silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . How are our tests progressing ? I want to ask . I almost do , but I am too angry at her for the silent wedge she 's driven between Glim and me . I wonder how much of her distrust of our relationship comes from her telepist training . How much from irrational fear ? How much from jealousy at our communion ? <p> A splash calls my attention back to the Pool . Serba takes Glim in over his head . He seems to be floating pretty well , if cautiously . She keeps moving away from him for longer periods while he gets his balance and breathing regulated . Soon he is actually paddling about . Except for the first public moments after our " mind sex " I have never seen Glim look awkward . I love him all the more for it . I long to touch him , but I know standing here , especially with Madrin right next to me , that I ca n't . . . <p> The Pool stretches out , silver and unruffled , before us . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the bottom . Two other zippers are on the other side of the water , and a separate group of people standing by the bank watches Glim 's progress . <p> Some children toss a ball back and forth by the bank . It is one of the dense balls used to play fryondy . They throw it harder and harder at each other , waiting to see who will give up first . The one closer to the Pool finally ducks . The ball sails out over the edge , clips Glimmer on the forehead and then sinks . For a brief moment I think he is going to come out of the Pool and chase the boys about , all in good fun . Instead I see his eyes roll and he goes limp , slipping below the surface . <p> Serba immediately starts to swim to where he went down . My heartbeat races ; the boys who were throwing the ball run away . <p> I start toward the Pool , but Madrin catches my arm . I react without thinking . Let go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong with our physical contact ; all of my anger , frustration , and fear pour through it . Her face pales , and she wrenches her hand from my arm . <p> " Can you sense him ? " she asks , her voice wavering . <p> Jump , commands the voice . <p> Serba resurfaces without Glim . I can not wait any longer . I run for the Pool . I pour all of my Telen into the Pool searching for any wisp that might be Glim . If anyone can find him , it 's me . I hear others diving in around me , but they search aimlessly . Blinded by the mirror of the water . <p> Glim 's mind touches me . I ca n't , he says to no one in particular . I ca n't . <p> Something breaks the surface of the Pool , and without thinking I dive into the Pool toward it . When I break the surface , the hair on the back of my neck and on my lower arms is prickling , and the air seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces in front of me , his forehead marred by an angry reddening bruise . Energy begins to fill me . The darkness intensifies , tinged with orange and white . <p> Can you touch the bottom ? he asks . <p> Just barely , I think . <p> He reaches out to hold onto my arm , and the energy intensifies tenfold , bubbling through my body until I feel like I 'll explode in a burst of white , black , and orange light . <p> The light breaks through the darkness over me , and looking up , I see in the black and brilliant orange two of them floating amid the miasmic colors . <p> The woman is beautiful , black hair , brown face . The others are here , she says , and I can sense them all ; children , adults , the chaperon , all of them who dove into the Pool , the weave of Telen from a world of minds shaping the conduit we are floating in . They are pure spirit . Come , join us , she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for you . <p> I ca n't swim , says Glim , grabbing harder onto my arm , and I realize that white light and black and orange continue to surround me and now ooze out to envelop Glim as well . I ca n't touch bottom anymore . <p> I ca n't swim , Glim repeats . I sweep him up in my arms and hold him , his arms going around my neck ; he is n't too heavy for me , which ca n't be right . <p> Do n't worry , I assure him , I 'll teach you how . <p> The more complete contact brings our minds together , and the meld is dizzying . Glim says , I 'm not sure . <p> Glim , I love you . I promise you , I 'll teach you how to swim . We 'll always be together . Like this  --  not separated by a disrupter or a telepist or anything . The color and light are all around us , and we begin to float up , into it , our physicality bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other reality , further away every moment . <p> I look up at the woman . Her hair is silver now , and her shape wavers as the current moves around her . She is glorious , but the welcome I felt only moments before is now colored with something sour . <p> Drop him , she says to me . <p> What ? is my response . I can not have heard her . I can feel the thought of my heart begin to thump in my chest . <p> I said , drop him . He 's weak like the others . Do n't tie yourself to such a one , she repeats . There 's no reason for you to waste yourself on a lowly warrior . There are many more worthy for your attention . <p> This is the Telen I have been hearing since our arrival . These are the Ellysians . The consequences rattle through my brain as we float , stunned by the light and beauty . <p> Jude , Glim 's Telen seems to emanate from my own mind , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't teach him ? The woman keeps beckoning . We float without effort toward her , Glim trailing behind clinging to my arm . Drop him ? No . Never . <p> No . <p> Resist , I say to Glim/me . <p> You ca n't resist , the Ellysian says . You 've already been altered . You ca n't survive in that dimension any longer . We 've been waiting for you . There are so many who want to see you . <p> Resist , I say . I can feel Glim joining with me to pull away from the Ellysian . The sinews of our minds weave together as one . Resist , we say . We start to slow . I look back toward the darkness where our world was only moments ago , the world where we worked together and sacrificed so much only to make a place for ourselves , a place that is tentative at best , but a place nonetheless . <p> The Ellysian speaks again , but I close my eyes to her , feeling Glim against me , embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , her ordering turning to pleading . <p> No , we say . We continue to pull away . The darkness becomes our focus . Together we push away from the woman . She starts to fade as the darkness envelops us even as the conduit attempts to close about us . Weight reasserts itself , and our flesh begins to bubble , searing away from the bone . Hideous pain , but our minds are still joined . <p> You will die , she blasts , and I can sense her need , the need of her race , their need for the strength of my Telen . We feel her pull at me , trying to seduce me into coming to them , the salving effect of the light countering the bum of the darkness . <p> We will stay together . Struggling back to the physical world in an explosion of pain , a searing blaze of energy , a joined sharing on into infinity . <p> You will die , she screams again as we drift farther . Look at what we offer you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better than the fate you are choosing . Our pain ripples back up through her as our limbs wither , and we now understand the twisted artifacts in the Justice building . <p> Not apart . The conduit pulls at us more desperately . <p> No , she howls , come back . <p> Together . We resist . <p> <p> <p> By Gordon Gross <p>
