Section : art books and videos <p> by Roxana Robinson 496 pp. , 6 1/2 x 9 1/2 photographs and illus. ; bibliog. , notes , index ; Edward Burlingame/Harper &; Row , Inc. , $25 . <p> Grace Glueck of the New York Times recently commented , " Though the artist herself is gone , the Georgia O'Keeffe industry is alive and well and generating money for her estate . " Roxana Robinson , who wrote the delightful novel Summer Light , had the support of O'Keeffe 's family for this lengthy version of her life and one can assume that it is the authorized legend . No artist has cultivated her own legend more assiduously than did O'Keeffe , yet one can still ask , " Who was Georgia O'Keeffe ? " <p> In all fairness , Robinson 's biography must be compared with Portrait of an Artist : A Biography of Georgia O'Keeffe , by Laurie Lisle . Lisle began writing her book in the late 1970s and it was released in 1980 ; the University of New Mexico Press issued an updated edition following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well-researched but not authorized by O'Keeffe , nor was it apparently welcomed by the artist ; but it has a bare-bones quality , a politesse about intimate matters , and a clarity that seem to harmonize with O'Keeffe 's stark style . In less than four hundred pages , Lisle covers the heredity and events of O'Keeffe 's life in detail . If somewhat dry in spots , Lisle can coin a succinct phrase , such as , " Georgia seemed to be willing herself to become extraordinary . " <p> Robinson 's approach , linear and anecdotal , is very close in structure to the earlier biography , repeating many of the same quotations and almost exactly the same incidents in words so similar they seem to echo Lisle 's book . For example , Lisle writes , " Not remembering and not feeling obligated to other women , O'Keeffe came to recent those who tried to appeal to her through feminism  --  and when feminist Gloria Steinem arrived in Abiquiu with a bouquet of red roses , O'Keeffe refused to see her . " Robinson 's version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steinem , the elegant doyenne of the women 's movement , appeared at the Abiquiu house with a bouquet of roses , O'Keeffe refused to see her . " <p> Robinson writes from the heart . She presents O'Keeffe as a woman beset by the obligations and disappointments of her life and determined to conquer them . In her portrait , we see an unhappy woman who was betrayed by her husband ( photographer Alfred Stieglitz ) , who had a serious psychoneurotic breakdown , and who climbed back to health through her art and willpower while remaining loyal to her marriage . Robinson 's tale is infiltrated with a feminist polemic that O'Keeffe might herself have well disparaged . The artist was fiercely ambitious and she intended to be taken as seriously as men  --  for her own sake , not for that of women 's rights . The point needs to be kept in mind while reading a number of passages , such as , " Each male artist whose work Georgia admired embodied a repressive psychological force by the very fact of his physical existence : if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarchal authority , by definition , prevented her from learning . " By contrast , Lisle has this to say : " O'Keeffe believed that she painted the way she did because , like any artist , she had an original way of seeing things , not because she was female . She felt that the psychological interpretations trivialized her work . " This is closer to the truth of O'Keeffe 's expressed opinion . <p> A revealing Freudian slip on Robinson 's part is her repeated use of " embody " or " embodiment , " words that seem to underscore her frank focus on the sexual aspects of the O'Keeffe myth . She refutes the suggestion that O'Keeffe had extramarital relations with women or with men . In particular , she attacks the rumor that there was a sexual liasion between O'Keeffe and Juan Hamilton , the artist 's companion-assistant during the last fourteen years of her life , although she believes O'Keeffe loved Hamilton and was totally subject to his influence long before she died . Robinson discusses many sides of the controversy surrounding the final days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Keeffe 's family following her death . <p> Both Lisle and Robinson give an honest picture of O'Keeffe 's imperial , erratic manners , as well as of her repeated acts of generosity . They establish her as a model of the self-actualizing woman . Robinson comes to grips with O'Keeffe 's ambivalent and changing relationships with other women and she does so with a penetration of the artist 's womanly nature . Robinson 's analysis creates of pitiful image of O'Keeffe 's old age  --  of her vulnerability . In place of the indomitable , lone figure on the desert , we find a woman whose security and solitude were buffered by others , all of whom suffered from her demands . Most of her retainers left , but not Hamilton . When O'Keeffe 's health declined to the point that she needed to be near her doctors , he moved her , his wife , and their children into large house in Santa Fe so that O'Keeffe could be cared for by her nurses  --  in privacy rather than at a nursing home . Despite the weakness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a woman larger than life , filled with a passion for art  --  the outlet through which she characteristically deflected her physical passions . <p> Neither Robinson nor Lisle deals with O'Keeffe 's art in a critical way , although they both describe the work sequentially with quotes from reviews and O'Keeffe 's statements about her paintings . Their preoccupation is with the woman herself . Roxana Robinson , however , brings her novelist 's insight to her subject . Putting aside the feminist-political message of this story , readers of Robinson 's book will encounter a full-bodied , hot-blooded O'Keeffe who has not been painted so vividly anywhere else , and that is a praiseworthy contribution to O'Keeffe-mania . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Mountain , New Mexico ( detail ) , by Georgia O'Keeffe , 1931 , oil , 30 x 36 .
