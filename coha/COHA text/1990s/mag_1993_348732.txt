TITLE : ANTIGONE IN NEW YORK <P> AUTHOR : JANUSZ GLOWACKI <P> WHERE : ARENA STAGE , WASHINGTON <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A Polish emigre wittily blends a classic theme with contemporary insight into immigrants and the homeless . <P> Life in communist Eastern Europe may have been hypocritical at best and brutal at worst , but it made its contribution to art . The ritual and melodrama of public existence , the need to express defiance in code , shaped a generation of visually imaginative , verbally polemic and metaphorically minded playwrights and directors . Many of them have enriched the U.S. stage as visitors or immigrants . None is funnier or a shrewder observer of his adopted homeland than Janusz Glowacki , a Pole whose 1987 Hunting Cockroaches poignantly and hilariously evoked the dilemma of the emigre artist  --  unable to interest audiences in stories about life back home and unable to trust his insights about the strange new world he inhabits now . <P> Glowacki proves just as witty , and far more acerbic , in a new play about two immigrants for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Richard Bauer ) and a depressive Russian drunk ( Ralph Cosham ) who are among the homeless living in New York City 's Tompkins Square Park . Set during an era of police raids against the squatters in 1989 , Antigone in New York takes its title from the Greek myth of a woman who defied political authority to give a fallen relative proper burial . <P> The slender plot centers on the two men 's attempts to retrieve a fallen comrade destined for potter 's field so they can inter him behind the bench they call home . The Antigone figure is the dead man 's lover , a deranged Puerto Rican ( Sheila Tousey ) who believes the shoulder pads of garments accumulate bad luck . Authority is personified by a fat , jolly black policeman ( Jeffery Thompson ) whose monologues gradually become more callous and sinister . The play owes at least as much to Beckett 's Waiting for Godot as it does to Sophocles , and it can be thoroughly enjoyed without knowledge of either . <P> The Russian is the sharper and better educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him cynical and morose . Linking a favorite painting to memories of living next door to a KGB interrogation facility , he says , " My father thought that in the 16th century Bosch had predicted our apartment in Leningrad , because he used music to drown out the screaming of the condemned . " The manic Pole gets just as many laughs with his inept lies , naked scheming and relentless self-pity . Recalling a newspaper story about a homeless woman who died with $25,000 on her person , he says , " Now there are crowds of people coming down here from upper Manhattan to roll us . Once I was rolled by a whole family . " <P> Such social criticism might sound implausible in the mouths of the unwashed , but Glowacki and the actors are entirely convincing . The second half drags a bit but has one stunning moment of irony . As the Puerto Rican woman sits embracing the rescued corpse , she recalls a moment of long-ago gallantry from the dead man  --  or someone she now believes was he  --  and asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ? " The answer is , all too easily . As the tramps have realized moments before , at the end of their odyssey they have taken the wrong body . The burial , like so many political rituals , is a false and pointless gesture .
