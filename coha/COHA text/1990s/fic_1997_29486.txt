Those of us born in the years of bounty after World War II knew we had a different outlook than earlier generations of Americans.Blinkered by need , they had come of age with narrower commitments -- to the glory of God , the glee of acquisition , or the mean little business of survival . But we took seriously the promise of the Declaration of Independence that the birthright of America was not merely life or liberty , but the pursuit of happiness . Personally , as a child , I always assumed that was the point of growing up . So I 'd feel better than I did then . Which leaves us with the awful doomed inquiry of our middle years , the harpy 's voice that whispers in dreams , at sunrise , at those unforeseen instants of drilling isolation : Is this as happy as I will ever be ? Do I have the right to just a little more ? Or is there nothing better I should hope for ?  --  MICHAEL FRAIN " The Survivor 's Guide , " September 7 , 1995 September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although this place is miles from water . The four high-rise towers hulk amid a hardened landscape of brick , of tar and pavement broken by weeds , of crushed Coke cups and candy wrappers , of fly-about newspaper pages . A silvery bedding of broken glass , the remnants of smashed bottles , glitters prettily -- one more false promise . It is a time of uncommon quiet . In the night , there are often sounds of life at the extreme : outcries and drunken yells , machines at volume . Sometimes gunfire . The day brings voices , children , the many standabouts , the species at large . Now the wind is up , whistling in the fence links and on the bricks . At the prospect of motion , the man walking this way looks up abruptly , but there is only a dog huddled in a gap between the buildings who , out of some animal instinct , has determined , across the distance of a hundred yards , to have no truck with him . A single used tire sits , inexplicably , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordell , is almost thirty-six years old . He still maintains some of his penitentiary build , buffed up , he 'd say , although he 's been out again four years now . He is dressed simply , black shirt and trousers . No gold . ' Do n't wear you no gold when you workin , ' he often advises the Unborns , the eight- and nine- and ten-year-old wannabes who trail after him , complimenting his appearance and offering to do him favors , when he arrives here most afternoons . ' Hardcore , ' they always goin , ' get you Co-Cola by Ko-rea ? ' like he do n't know they aimin to keep the change . This morning , Ordell Trent , gang name Hardcore , is alone . The building he approaches , the tallest of the four which comprise the Grace Street Projects , has come over the years to be called by everyone ' the I.V . Power , ' due supposedly to the Roman numerals , but most suspect the label originated with the familiar mockery of the residents practiced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Ivory Tower . The open structures -- windows , porches , connecting walkways -- are caged in mesh of heavy gauge . Formerly , from the gangways and balconies refuse was sometimes thrown , bricks were tossed down on enemies as in the Middle Ages , drunks and dopeheads stumbled to their death , and several persons were pushed . Around three or four windows you can see the ragged blackening marks of bygone fires and at street level , on the bricks , in rounded letters , the initials of Ordell 's gang have been inscribed in phosphorescent colors etched in black : " BSD . " Black Saints Disciples . His set -- the branch of the gang which Ordell heads -- the T-4 Rollers , is often celebrated , too , and some daring members of Gangster Outlaws , a rival organization , have also put their marks here , wallbanging , as it is known . Occasional messages of personal affirmation , quickly sprayed , appear now and then as well . " D'Ron Is Cool . " " Lucifer ! " Inside , Ordell nods to security , Chuck , he named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a concrete shelter with a small window of bulletproof glass . Chuck gettin half-a-one -- fifty dollars -- every month from Ordell , and Chuck , he like to love Hardcore , man , see him , Chuck damn well salute . In the entry , the sole illumination is from a Pepsi machine , with a heavy padlock . Every electrical fixture is gone , stolen to sell , or put out by some Saint who prefers to do business in the dark . Bare wires in twisted bunches snake from the walls . The atmosphere is sodden with the bitter reek of hallway filth and broken plumbing . The paint is old ; the pipes , exposed overhead , have grown rust stains and mold . The impression is of a bunker -- something built to survive the bomb . The floor is concrete , the walls are cinder block . **26;242;TOOLONG marked with gang signs : the Saints ' halo , the capped ' 4 ' which represents the T-4 Rollers , and names --  " D-town , " " Mike-o-Mite , " " Baby Face , " " Priest "  - -  written in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or paint with a cigarette lighter . The elevator , one of them , is working again today and Hardcore rides to 17 . The first five floors of this building are more or less deserted now , given up by folks who found even $38.50 a month too high a price for a life where beds had to be placed on the floors to avoid the gunfire , where the safest sleeping was in the bathtub . When he lets himself in , Hardcore hears the old woman 's husky breath , clotted by the deteriorations of living , emerging from one of the two back rooms he lets her have . Ordell has the two front rooms . Where he watches . From up here , he can see the entire operation . Sometimes the po-lice -- 'Tic-Tac , ' as the Saints call the Kindle County Municipal Police Force Tactical Unit -- the ones who wo n't accept Hardcore 's money and a few who do , sit down there and watch . They 're wondering , he knows . How come this nigger so cool , how come it freeze up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From here . He got all them tiny gangsters -- the youngest gang members -- 'peepers , ' as they 're called , rovin , scopin . Any po-lice , any rent-a-cop , any limp DEA , any them mothers truck into them towers , Hardcore gone know . On the street that cuts a perpendicular , there are two three-flats and some tiny gangsters down there on the steps each day , servicing the cars that pull up . They got rock , bottles , crank , sometime pills . Some Top Rank Gangsters , veterans in BSD , they-all slang a couple zones -- sell a couple ounces -- to they homies every week , be tight , all they need . Not Ordell . He got him houses and ladies , he got a Blazer and a slick BMW 755 , shit , he got his gold , but what be fat and all is this thang , what he got goin here -- 'DJs , ' so called , to mix the stuff , and ' scramblers , ' who get paid in drugs to make the connections , ' mules ' to carry it and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's stored , and his ' artillery , ' Honcho , Gorgo , and them , armed motherfuckers so nobody think they can move up on Ordell . Seventy-five people , sometime a hundred , and Hardcore watchin over : Go here , mother , go there , do n't get beat by no snitch , do n't deal with no narc , do n't mess with no rings or gold , see cash , man , do it ! That 's what he wants , somethin happenin , man , every day . Now , slightly past 6:00 , his beeper alerts , vibrating at his hip . Hardcore curses aloud when he inspects the readout : Nile . More whining . " Too late for that shit , " he notes to himself . At his voice , the old woman 's rasping breath briefly ceases . Perhaps she is awake now , listening , pressing at her grey hair , snuffling and clearing her throat in hopes he 'll leave . Here in the front room , there is nothing . Two chairs . Old newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early light . The rug was stolen long ago . This was her apartment , raised her children here , the boy in Rudyard , two boys , Ordell thinks , and some bitch , a silly pipehead selling what she can out on the street . In the pen , the boys come to Jesus and busted out , quit BSD . So Ordell 's set moved in here . The old woman was tough . ' You-all go on , shoot and kill me , do whatever you-all like , I ain movin out , this here 's my house , I ain givin my house to no bunch of silly-ass hoodlums . ' T-Roc , one of BSD 's two heads , Vice-Lord he called -- T-Roc told Hardcore straight up , ' Do just like she say , man , fade her . ' Hardcore , he put in work for his , done whatever for BSD , be a bar-none Saint and all , but he do n't fall to cappin no old lady . He decided leave her stay . ' And I ain gone have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither , ' she 'd said to Ordell . ' We ain doin nothin , ' he told her . ' Hmm , ' she said . Now she sleeps . Just then , 6:15 like they been sayin , he sees the ride , some shitbox Chevy a hundred years old , bend the corner on the street far below . Now , Ordell thinks , now we gone tear some shit up . He has field glasses but he can see well enough . Bug , just folding the flip-phone back into her jacket , approaches the car . Then she retreats a distance , as she 's supposed to do . The cell phone in his pocket makes a throaty sound . " Yo , " he answers . " ' T 's up , cuz ? " " Ten-two , " Lovinia says . They use radio code , mix it up , make them Tic-Tacs crazy . " Ten-two . " Means trouble . Need help . " You hear ? " she adds . That Lovinia . Do n't never have no respect . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see no damn 10-2 . " On the broad avenue , on Grace Street , there is nothing , cars , white folks driving by fast . Not even foot trade . " I ai n't seed nothin . You standin still , bitch , and you best be hittin the wall , man . " " Ain to see , not from where you is , and I ain talkin on this punk-ass telephone neither . Ten . Two . " She 's gone with that . Setup , he thinks , as he often thinks . Bug -- as Lovinia is known -- damn Bug be settin him up . Kan-el , T-Roc , one them , maybe them Goobers -- as the Saints call the Gangster Outlaws -- one them switched her somehow . He ponders Kan-el and T-Roc , Commandant and Vice-Lord of BSD . They on top , man , but they all the time trippin and shit , worryin is Hardcore on this power thang , man , he gone bust his whole set right out the gang or what ? And him running eight zones into the jail every week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booty he be gone for-ever . Set him up . " Mmm . " He grunts aloud at the thought of it . But he 's on his way . He has a 9-millimeter pistol stored behind the iron grating of the air return and he tucks it in his belt and lets his black silk shirt hang out of his trousers . In the elevator he continues rumbling with his angry thoughts , speaking to himself and wondering if he should have shouted out for Honcho , some of them . Scared , he thinks , scared is what he is and old enough to know it . All them youngsters always puttin down that shit , ' Cai n't no nigger fade me , ' shit like that , make him laugh . You always scared . Get used to it is all . Got ta be is got ta be . He has three sons . Dormane -- Hardball he called -- got two kids of his own , he inside , doing fifteen no-parole on some fool buy-bust , and Rakleed is on these streets , too , and the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of nothing . They mommas , each of them , behind Ordell 's back , told those boys the same . ' Do n't you be no dope peddler now , do n't you be slangin and hangin and bangin , I 'll be whompin you backside , you ain never gone be too big for me do you like that . ' That 's what they sayin . In his own time , Ordell gave each of these boys his answer : ' You got to be somebody . They 's bad shit here . With them bad coppers -- bad motherfuckers everywhere here . But , man , ' he said , ' man , this here what you-all's -- you with the people here , you giving them what these poor riggers need , some nickel 's worth of happiness white folks and all do n't want them havin . ' Walking from the IV Tower , the first stirrings of the day , music and voices , from some windows , wondering is he really gone get himself gauged , Hardcore thinks , as he often does , about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the concrete corner has parted , revealing a cheap core of pink foam . In a nearby play area , only one seesaw remains , and on that both seats were long ago shattered by some teen in a random outbreak of destructive will . A milky-eyed drunk is teetering down the block , slept it off somewhere and now looking for home . He has a tatty overcoat and his hat askew , a face of white whiskers , and when he sees Hardcore , he wants to move , get out the way , man , and his legs ca n't let him . Funny . Hardcore calls him " Man " as he passes by . They got they needs , he thinks , wishing he 'd told his boys that , too . ' Everybody on these streets , man , these motherfuckers out here is just completely crazy with what they need . This gal she need her check , and this momma be needin to hold her baby , and that old cat need his fix . ' Needing . He sometimes thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of what everybody needs . He crosses the boulevard , Grace Street , and starts down Lawrence , a block of ruined three-story apartment buildings , stout as battlements , with flat tarred roofs and limestone blocks placed decoratively amid the dark bricks and as a border above the doorways and at the cornices . The windows are gone in some , boarded up . A raised garden area of railroad ties sits under the windows of 338 , the dirt desert dry , even the weeds struggling to survive . " Yo , " Lovinia calls , emerging like a cat from one of her hiding places . This Lovinia , he thinks . God , look-it here at this scrawny bitch , motherfucker are you gone believe it ? With this fuzzball stocking cap dragged down over her whole damn head and this grey coat and twill pants . Do n't want nobody comin up on her to know she a bitch is what it is , figure they 'll shoot her ass or molest her ass or somethin . They better not try neither , she ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , but you bet she got it near here , under the mailbox , or in a hole in one them trees , you mess with her , she gone smoke you ass . Word up . T-Roc , he think Hardcore stone crazy using Bug , but she sharp . She strut up to the cars , she change her whole routine now , she sort of swingin it a lot . ' What you like , man ? ' Make them say . Anybody she take for Tic-Tac , narco , when they say ' Dope , ' she just go , ' Oh , man , I ain sellin dope , man , I got somethin sweeter ' n that , man , ' like she thinkin they was here to bone . Now she points to the white Nova at the curb , a hundred feet away . " I done told her , ' Lady , you in the wrong place . ' " " Lady ? What kind of motherfuckin lady ? " " Tol ' you now , 10-2 . He ain come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bug smiles then , toward the walk . Lovinia , just a kid and all -- fifteen -- she love to play . " Lady , " Hardcore repeats a few more times . Damn . He advances on the car . " Lady , this the wrong place for you . " Leaning into the darkness of the car , he catches some of her soapy smell and the humid sour scent of his own overheated breath . " You best get out here fast . " " Mr. Trent ? I 'm June Eddgar . " She extends her hand , and then laboriously leaves the car to stand in the bluish morning light . Old . She be fat , too , big and fat . Some kind of hippie or farmer or some such , and her thighs all mashed together in her jeans . She have a plain face and some long lightish brown kinda hair going to grey , kind of lopsided and knit together like it ai n't really combed . " I thought we could talk a minute . " " Lady , they ain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I thought -- I 'm Nile 's mother . " " Told him get hisself here . Did n't tell him send nobody 's momma . " " I thought it was better if I came . " " You better go . Thass all . They 's some powerful shit may go down here . Word , now . Go on . " He steps away , flitting his hand . " Look , I know them both . I think there 's a misunderstanding . " " Only misunderstandin is you stayin here stead of leavin out when I say go . Thass the only misunderstanding we got . " " I really think --  " " Lady , you gone get fucked up bad , you hear ? Now jump in you rusty-ass ride . " He throws a hand again in disgust and walks away . Lovinia has stepped toward the street , waving . " Gorgo , " she calls , signaling overhead . " Aw , fuck me , motherfuck , " Hardcore says . From the alley across the way , Gorgo has emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a mask on , a blue handkerchief across his face like he some cowboy motherfucker , but looks otherwise like he just goin home to momma , blue pack fixed on his back , red satin jacket , hat turned behind his ear , just a kid , if you do n't notice the gat -- the gun -- held low by his side . A 9 . Got his Tec-9 . The semiautomatic weapon , from its sheer weight , seems to drag behind as Gorgo rides . Bug keeps on waving , calling out as Gorgo rushes on , but he does n't see her . He never will , Hardcore knows . You can see Gorgo 's eyes at sixty feet now , popped out like some pipehead 's , only with him all it is is panic . I got ta do this , Gorgo 's thinking , got to do this , man . Hardcore knows . His whole self is shrunken down to a little pea of violent will , so there 's no room for anything to tell him no . The gun is tip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of it but the small silver o and the frightening black space within it , at the end of the muzzle . " Gorgo ! " she calls again , and Hardcore , who has already dropped to the pavement , catches the hem of her coat and drags at it . " Get yo fool self down , " he says , and she comes to him , easy as a leaf falling from a tree , just as the first shots bolt the air . Damn guns always be louder than you expect . The reports come at once , five or six volleys , a rampage of sound . Just that quick . Afterwards , it is the same as always , a moment of awful , cowering stillness -- the birds gone from the trees , radios knocked silent , folks in the adjoining buildings stretched out flat along the cold floors , desperate not to stir . Caught up , the pointed scent of gunpowder embitters a sudden breath of wind . A block off , in some silly act of jubilation and relief , Gorgo cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ribbon . Breathe , Ordell thinks , breathe now , nigger . He 's amped : his heart is hard with panic . You okay . He talks to himself . You not hurt , stay cool , stay movin . Then he sees the blood spread darkly on the sidewalk . He has been shot twice before , once when he was sixteen , that was some serious shit , sort of giving face to some dude , and the mother pulled out a .38 and boom , just like it was but a little more downtalk . Now he cool . He 's checked his body twice , felt everything . He damn well knowed he was gone get hisself popped and he did n't . But Lovinia has hold of her knee , and she is moaning . " Happenin , Bug ? " She 's crying . Tears well across her smooth face and curl in silvery traces about her mouth . " It hurt , Hardcore . Man , it hurt real bad . " " We gone help you , girlfriend . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , with her knee drawn up halfway . Her hands are covered with blood and it has turned most of the right leg of her twills brown ; this close , he can detect the strange animal smell of it . He is n't going to get her to move , he can see that . How 'd she go get shot in the damn leg of all places ? Ricochet , or some such . Dudes shot in the leg died , too . He 'd seen that . Severed femoral artery . Leg might be broke . There was no use shoutin out for any of his people , tiny gangsters or them . Soon as the guns rang out , they sprung . " That Gorgo . I 'm gone fuck that motherfucker up bad . " Gorgo is long gone -- between the buildings , up an alley , down one more gangway . Somewhere along , the Tec-9 went into the backpack . Now he 's just some skinny kid out on his ride . Up above , somewhere , a window screams as it 's opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I hope . " The woman 's voice carries clearly in the thin morning . " I hope you dead . Look at what you-all done . " " Call the ' mergency , bitch , " he shouts . " I already done that . Po-lice comin . They gone take yo sorry ass down to the jail where it belong , Hardcore . " At his name , he wheels and the window is slammed to , that fast , before he can see . Lovinia is still moaning . " Gone help you , homegirl , " he repeats . The white lady , he sees now , Nile 's momma , she layin there , too . They 's just blood , blood , all over her head . Half her brownish hair gone and she ai n't moving none . Smoked , he thinks . He 's seen dead before and knows it for sure . Bug is all gone to pieces . Some is like that . Them po-lices , Tic-Tacs , they done her like they do , took her , handcuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smacking them nightsticks in they palms , she be tight , like it do n't bother her none . But now she cryin like a baby , she like something what got broke . She was n't gon na hold . Nile neither . Specially Nile . His daddy gone be goin on now , in his shit . When them Tic-Tacs start in with questions , was n't nobody gone ride this beef . Gone be all fucked up . " Po-lice comin , " he tells Bug . He 's going to have to figure something . That damn woman know his name . Tic-Tac be knocking on his door . Call the attorney . Call Attorney Aires , he thinks . Gone have to look after hisself . How it always be . He stands . The white Nova is messed up . The windows , except the one which was open , are shot through , jagged pieces gone and the remainder a map of silver crazes ; the tires on the side that faced Gorgo 's onslaught are flattened , causing the car to list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a single bullet hole , the white paint burned grey about it . Damn him anyway , Hardcore thinks . Damn Nile , fuck everything up . " Best gim me that shit , girlfriend . You got trouble enough . " She opens her mouth , but cries out as she turns herself to reach . " Here ? " he asks and slips his finger quickly between her tooth and gum to pull out the little foil packet . Goddamn , what he gone catch from her mouth anyway ? " This here just some damn drive-by , " he tells her . " You hear ? Outlaws ridin down . Po-lice gone be askin . Thass what you say . Same as we done said . Just Goobers ridin down on you . " He touches her cheek . She was n't never gone stand up to Tic-Tac . " Posse out , " he says . Bye-bye . " P.O. , " she repeats . He hates it most when he has to run .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
