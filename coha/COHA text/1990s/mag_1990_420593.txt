Section : U.S. News The road to ' 92 <p> If you liked Washington 's last show , you 'll love the next one . The maneuverings of George Bush and the next Congress will be more politicized , less productive and more focused on penny ante policies than the one that just ended <p> George Bush laid down the law , or at least his latest version of it , during a surprise appearance at a senior staff meeting last week . The President grinned and declared breezily that , with the election finally over , it was time to stop bashing the Democrats and start governing again . " We 're going to go positive now , ' he announced . " We 're going to stop all this divisiveness inside the White House . ' <p> Easy for him to say . But as word spread through Washington about the President 's latest marching orders , there was new confusion about the administration 's direction and tone . Republican officials feared that Bush had failed to grasp the most elementary lessons of an election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine in the House and Republicans lost key sun-belt statehouses . " He seems to have lost his inner gyroscope , ' says a Bush adviser . <p> Not that the Democrats seem much better off . They promise a more aggressive agenda of social programs and tax changes . But the fact is that neither side has a strong , coherent program for the next Congress , which will soon enough be overwhelmed by the posturing of a presidential campaign . The likely outcome is an even worse dithering and stalemate than the last Congress produced , even as the country sinks into recession and a dangerous crisis in the Persian Gulf remains unresolved . <p> Bush has two big problems . First , his advisers say he ca n't decide whether to follow a strategy of confrontation or conciliation on domestic policy . His unwillingness to set a firm strategic course only makes worse the civil war in his own party ( see story , page 28 ) . And despite his decision last week to send as many as 150,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as 400,000 , his decisions about how to handle the campaign against Iraq 's Saddam Hussein are not likely to rally the national support he 'll need if he wants to go to war . One adviser says Bush believes the country will support him only if he appeals to pure patriotism . So he is focusing on maltreatment of U.S. hostages and the slow starvation of the U.S. Embassy staff by the Iraqis . Such a rationale may turn out to be shortsighted and simplistic when the tanks start to roll . <p> Domestic debates . Bush 's performance in the election is another cause for White House concern . He showed that he does not have the public support to enforce his will - even if he had the temperament to crack down on critics . The election results only worsened his problems . With a firmer grip on Congress , says Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , the Democrats plan to seize control of the domestic agenda . <p> The hottest debate will come over differing plans to stimulate the economy . Bush , once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats have n't yet settled on a plan . House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski is expected to introduce another surtax on millionaires early next year and to attempt to raise the top income-tax rate from 31 to 33 percent . Bush rejected both proposals this year , and his continued opposition will enable the Democrats to tag him as a protector of the rich . Democratic strategists also are preparing to hammer home that point by reintroducing Rostenkowski 's proposal to create a capital-gains tax break for the middle class . One version would be to exempt $100,000 in lifetime capital-gains income from taxation for families earning less than $100,000 a year . Democrats also will be pressing for legislation aimed at other key constituencies - requiring businesses to provide improved health benefits for the middle class providing long-term health care for the elderly and providing more federal assistance for child care , which appeals to mothers . <p> Key advisers to Bush , whose approval ratings have dropped about 20 points since the budget debacle , are divided on how to meet the Democratic challenge . Hawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Nicholas Brady and many House Republicans , want a tougher , adversarial relationship . Doves , organized around Budget Director Richard Darman and Bush pollster Robert Teeter , favor more of a let's-make-a-deal strategy because it allows Bush to portray himself as an effective leader . <p> What will emerge now is a counterpunching strategy in which Bush does not initiate confrontation with congressional Democrats but waits for them to submit their own proposals - then strikes back with a veto . Last week 's elections gave him enough support in Congress to have his vetoes sustained on most issues . And his political aides think this approach will help set the themes for the 1992 race and show that Democrats are taxers , spenders and liberals bent on meddling in citizens ' lives . Pollster Teeter says that despite the budget fiasco and Bush 's reversal on tax increases , voters by a 10-point margin rate Republicans as better able than Democrats to hold down taxes and spending . <p> Same old ideas . No matter what course Bush sets , most of his advisers agree with a batch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and told the President he needs to breathe new life into his administration . Some fear he will simply string together some warmed-over ideas from his first two years without a comprehensive unifying principle . Another worry , especially among conservatives who resent Bush 's abandonment of the no-new-taxes pledge , is that the deficit will worsen despite this year 's budget deal , and Bush will have to fight the same tax-and-spend battles in 1991 and 1992 without any guiding principles . <p> There are signs , however , that Bush is slowly moving toward what White House insiders call " an empowerment agenda . " It packages some old and new self-help initiatives under the theme that government should , as one adviser puts it , " get people to accept responsibility for themselves , and we have to give them the tools . ' Leading candidates for the agenda include proposals for tax-free savings accounts for health care and education and tax credits rather than grants to the states for child care . Inspired by the election results , Bush will also push for term limitations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school-choice initiative , the President will continue to seek programs allowing parents to pick their children 's schools . <p> Among the growing number of advisers who favor the empowerment agenda are Teeter , domestic-policy adviser Roger Porter , domestic-policy planner James Pinkerton and William Kristol , Vice President Dan Quayle 's chief of staff . This week Bush will announce creation of an Empowerment Task Force headed by Jack Kemp , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . The panel 's recommendations are expected to be a key part of Bush 's state-of-the-union address in January . <p> The Sununu factor . It is unlikely , however , that Bush can fully recover without beefing up his White House staff . Sununu not only controls domestic policy but , with the illness of Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater , is increasingly Bush 's main political strategist . Washington veterans insist that Sununu can not handle both jobs himself and point to the budget fiasco as proof . Sununu 's refusal to listen to advice has undermined crucial White House functions . Liaison with important constituency groups , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been badly weakened because Sununu and Darman cut those staffers out of key strategy sessions . The speech writers have been relegated to little more than word processors , leaving Bush 's oratory limp and boring . And the advance-planning staff has regularly embarrassed Bush by putting him in awkward positions , for instance , by allowing him to be filmed by TV crews while he failed to persuade a voter to back Texas GOP gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams . <p> While the President seems wedded to Sununu and Darman for now , advisers suggest that he may eventually shift Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner to a high-profile White House job . Ken Duberstein , former chief of staff at the Reagan White House , may return as a temporary counselor , and a new communications specialist might be hired . <p> Yet it is far from certain that Bush realizes the extent of his problems and his need for new ideas and new faces . Some aides are hoping for a further decline in his job-approval ratings to push him into decisive action . If anything can persuade Bush finally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is his instinct for self-preservation . <p> Picture : Fail to the chief . The President can not decide between confronting or compromising with feistier Democrats .
