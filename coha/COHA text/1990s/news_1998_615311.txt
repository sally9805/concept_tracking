<p> Mitch Reiner can remember 61 phone numbers , his Social Security number , his parents ' birthdays , his locker combination , his kid brother 's age ( sort of : " Twel-el-el-ve . Yeah , 12. " ) , his best and worst golf scores , the year Columbus sailed for the New World , and the price and product number of every single smoothie at Smoothie King . <p> OK , that 's because he works there . Still , that 's a lot of numbers to keep track of  --  especially for someone who just turned 16 . <p> " If you think about it , it 's really not much , because it 's everything you think about . All your friends , all the numbers you know , " says Mitch , a sophomore at Pope High School in Marietta . <p> Just think of what we use numbers for every day : phones , pagers , ZIP codes , bank accounts , security codes , TV channels , clothing sizes , airline flights , appointments , important dates . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you used to , mostly thanks to technology . We interact with machines instead of humans more than ever . Instead of bank tellers , we use ATMs ; instead of secretaries , we use voice mail . <p> No studies have been done on the number of numbers people have to memorize or the number of numbers a person can memorize . But anecdotal evidence overwhelmingly points to a greater dependence on numbers . <p> Arlethia Perry-Johnson , an assistant vice chancellor of the state Board of Regents , says her number memory load has increased noticeably in the last several years , partly because of work-related innovations such as Internet access and new software programs . <p> " It 's amazing , the tremendous amount of numbers we have to deal with now , " said Michael Epstein , a cognitive psychologist at Rider University in Lawrenceville , N.J. <p> People tend to move around more than they did decades ago . Plus , there are simply more people using the same 10 numerals . <p> " The number of people who are using systems requires that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As if you have to tell that to anybody in metro Atlanta , where beepers , cell phones and fax machines have spawned so precipitously that we have acquired not one , but two new telephone area codes in the past three years . Now we have to remember more numbers . . . so we can remember more numbers . <p> Then again , consider the possible alternatives . Had the father of 11th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci not sent him to an Arab math teacher when he was young , he would n't have introduced Arabic numerals to the Western world , and we might still be using the Roman numeral system in the year MCMXCVIII . Enough said , and apologies to the people who run the Super Bowl . 2 . Remember when the Atlanta phone book was a book , instead of a five-volume series ? Remember when you could count TV channels on your fingers , with some left over ? <p> If you can , your days of total recall are , um , numbered . Robin West , a psychology professor at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 and older have a much harder time than those under 40 remembering a string of 10 numbers . <p> Memory is fallible at any age , though . Christina Dicks does n't have her driver 's license yet , and the 15-year-old Roswell High sophomore can recite nearly 220 numbers , including 26 birthdays and anniversaries ( big family ) . But her brother 's work number eludes her . So she keeps a list of important numbers in her purse , in addition to her address book at home . <p> " I can know a number and then not talk to that person for a month and forget it , " Christina mused . <p> It 's funny , what we do and do n't remember . You probably do n't memorize your credit card numbers . You do n't need to , unless you habitually lose your wallet , and then you have bigger issues . <p> A lot of people seem to forget their own cell phone numbers . <p> " I know somebody else 's cell phone , but I do n't know my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident also does n't know the Social Security numbers of her three children , but she remembers her ex-husband 's . <p> Buckhead resident David Michaelson , 45 , is a serious baseball fan who has participated in rotisserie leagues for 10 years . He knows some pretty obscure statistics , such as the fact that Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby had the highest batting average in the National League for six consecutive years , 1920 to 1925 . He also can tell you the year of every car he 's ever owned , starting with a 1968 Ford Falcon . <p> But just ask him his license plate number . <p> " I could n't tell you , " he admitted . " I always have to go look . I mean , it 's on the back of my car . " 3 . The human memory is limitless . People can , and often do , remember numbers they no longer need , such as old street addresses and the phone number they had when they were 8 . <p> If memory had a " do not fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental attics with the number of calories in a Big Mac ( 530 ) or the number of times Elizabeth Taylor has been married ( somewhere between the number of Henry VIII 's wives and Shaquille O'Neal 's shoe size ) . <p> But the human memory actually is n't very good at remembering abstract concepts such as numbers . <p> " There 's a wide range of relatively arbitrary information that we have to deal with , " said William Glassman , a psychology professor at Ryerson Polytechnic University in Toronto . " The problem is that our memory is not well designed to deal with random pieces of information . Our memory is designed to deal with information in a context . " <p> A good memory trick is to give numbers a context by attaching a mental image . <p> " We can remember pictures better than intangible things . We can remember ' toy ' better than we can remember ' equilibrium , ' ' kangaroo ' better than ' vague , ' " said David Markoff , a memory improvement expert in Malibu , Calif. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was it ? Oh , yeah , " Memoryman . " <p> When Markoff is n't hawking his memory self-help courses or memorizing 50-digit numbers forward and backward , he 's promoting the action-packed " Memoryman " comic strip , in which Memoryman appears as a tights-clad superhero with ripped quads and the ability to memorize TV Guide . You may not find this as impressive as , say , leaping tall buildings in a single bound , but it 's an image you wo n't quickly forget . 4 . And that 's the whole point : to form visual associations with numbers . Even something as simple as noticing where numbers are on a telephone keypad or seeing a pattern in a number makes its memory more durable . <p> For example , Hornsby earned the highest ever National League batting average  --  .424  --  in 1924 , and Michaelson is quick to point out that the last two digits of both numbers are the same . <p> Perry-Johnson uses numbers significant to her when choosing access codes and passwords . <p> " I try to use things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You ca n't always choose the numbers you want , though . A popular trick for remembering random numbers involves using a mnemonic system to convert them into words or phrases , by substituting certain consonants for each numeral and then filling in whatever vowels are needed . According to this system , the number 31 translates into MT . Insert an A and you get the word mat . <p> Perhaps it would be easier to mentally coordinate 31 with Baskin-Robbins ' famed flavors . This system may seem cumbersome , but proponents assure it 's worthwhile , especially for longer strings of numbers . Probably the poorest way to learn numbers is rote memorization , or repeating something over and over . <p> " It 's a mistake to think that mnemonics is easier , " Epstein said . " The key is that it 's more effective . " <p> The length of a number also plays a role . Psychologists have theorized that the average person 's short-term memory can retain five to nine " chunks " of information without difficulty . <p> Initially , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security number , consider each number a memory chunk . After a while , the entire string itself becomes one chunk and you can rattle it off without effort . <p> Jon Keith of Ormond Beach , Fla. , who trains older people in memory improvement , suggests visualizing numbers in groups of threes and imagining funny or silly scenes to accompany each group . Why funny ? <p> " The last time you went on vacation and nothing happened ? It 's like a dream . The last time you were embarrassed in front of people ? You remember every detail , " explained Keith , who has dazzled TV talk show audiences by memorizing the names of every person in the studio . 5 . You could try to simplify the numbers in your life by choosing the same digits for all passwords and access codes , as some do . Should this sacred number ever fall into unscrupulous hands , however , you risk an empty checking account , charges for long-distance phone calls you never made , malicious e-mail sent in your name , general pandemonium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Year 2000 problem , which just goes to show that skimping on numbers is n't necessarily a good idea . <p> In the 1970s , computer programmers trying to conserve memory space decided to use only the last two digits of a year for dates . Under this system , a computer recognizes 1999 as 99 and 2000 as 00  --  which comes before , not after , 99 , thus throwing computers ' internal clocks for a wild loop . Companies worldwide are spending billions trying to fix the problem , and glitches are still expected . <p> As technology improves , the numbers in your life will increase . Cable companies say digital TV , which is just around the corner , will multiply channel capacity from dozens to hundreds . Phone companies are heading toward " number portability , " which will allow people to take their phone number wherever they go , thus eliminating the original meaning of area codes  --  and making 10-digit dialing the norm , not the exception . <p> Better work on your number recall  --  or buy a portable Rolodex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of the time . <p> You can count on it .
