<p> A BLT is as American as fireworks on the Fourth , but its origins may be lost in time . The Dictionary of American Food &; Drink lists " BLT " as part of the luncheonette counter lingo between waitress and short-order cook , but does n't shed light on where the first bits of B , L and T were sandwiched together , or by whom . <p> As murky as its source may be , it is nevertheless clear that bacon , lettuce and tomato are a hallowed combination that Americans hold dear . It would seem simple to pile together this cherished favorite , but there are some basic requirements that must be met to achieve BLT blastoff . <p> What 's important to the BLT 's success is the quality of the ingredients . Here are the basic building blocks of a classic BLT : <p> * Bread . The " perfect , " classic BLT starts with freshly made toast from firm white sandwich bread . <p> * Spread . Add a healthy slather of homemade mayonnaise to that toasted bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vine-ripened tomatoes that are lightly salted and more heavily peppered . <p> * Lettuce . Top with a hunk of chilled heart of iceberg lettuce . <p> * Bacon . Lay on a rasher of crisp , warm bacon . <p> Nothing more need be said , right ? Well . . . <p> OK , it may seem sacrilegious to tamper with the BLT , but the devilish side of a curious cook says , " Why not ? " Especially if  --  within the theme of uniting bacon , lettuce and tomato  --  you come up with a bundle of intriguing recipes as delicious and focused as the original . <p> We 'll start by taking a small step away from the traditional : A " contemporary " classic could be fashioned from whole-wheat toast , organic produce and nitrite-free bacon . ( For favorite varieties of bacon , lettuce and tomatoes , see sidebars , page XX ) . <p> A Hero BLT takes the sandwich a step farther , with marinated tomatoes and a few capers and olives . <p> A Shrimp Roll BLT stays focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using the Maine lobster roll for inspiration and embellishing it with a little  --  that 's right  --  bacon , lettuce and tomato . <p> But how creatively crazy can you get and remain credible ? The club sandwich ? Who knows whether the father of this sandwich saw it as an extension of the BLT ? But it certainly is , and a good one . Egg salad or crab salad sandwiched with bacon , lettuce and tomato make sense , too . Jalapeno chile mayonnaise on an otherwise straightforward BLT ? Yes . <p> Pasta BLT salad ? BLT Wrap ? Absolutely not . <p> We drummed up several recipes that make refreshing combinations of the classic trio . A few basil leaves in an otherwise straightforward sandwich add a pleasant accent of flavor . Substituting Italian pancetta for American bacon makes sense , too , especially when you trade sandwich bread for crusty Italian or French bread and garlic mayonnaise for plain . <p> Walking on what we consider the safe side of wild , we also offer two salads  --  one a INGREDIENTS : <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay leaves and/or several sprigs of thyme <p> * Salt to taste <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Pick over the beans for debris and small stones ; rinse , then place in a large pot . <p> Pour in cold water to cover by about 2 inches . Let soak overnight . <p> ( Or do a quick-soak : Bring to a boil , then simmer for a minute or two . Remove from the heat , cover and let stand for 1 hour . ) <p> Drain the beans , then cover with fresh water ( the water should again come about 2 inches above the beans ) . Add the bay leaves and/or thyme . <p> Bring to a boil , reduce heat , cover and cook at a low simmer for about 1 hour . Cooking time depends on the age of the beans ; start testing them at about 40 minutes . <p> Season with salt when they are almost tender . Remove the bay leaves and/or thyme . <p> Let the beans cool , then store in a covered container in the refrigerator for use throughout the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 calories , 15 g protein , 45 g carbohydrate , 1 g fat ( 0 g saturated ) , 0 mg cholesterol , 9 mg sodium , 12 g fiber . <p> . <p> WEEKEND RECIPE : BASIC SOAKED BULGUR WHEAT <p> This does n't necessarily have to be done on the weekend .

Not only does the bulgur absorb the oniony scent and flavor , but it is a very satisfying thing to do . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables rather than mixing them in  --  cucumbers and tomatoes can make tabbouleh too watery , especially if it sits for a while . <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> * 1 cup soaked bulgur wheat ( see recipe ) <p> * 1 bunch green onions , chopped <p> * 3 garlic cloves , chopped <p> * 1 1/2 cups chopped parsley <p> * 1 1/2 cups chopped mint <p> * 1/4 cup or so extra virgin olive oil <p> * Salt and black pepper to taste <p> * Juice of 2 lemons , or to taste <p> * Romaine lettuce leaves or blanched fresh ( or rinsed bottled ) grape leaves <p> * Wedges of ripe tomatoes <p> * Black Greek-style olives <p> * 1/2 cucumber , peeled , seeded and sliced <p> INSTRUCTIONS : Combine the bulgur and green onions in a bowl ; mix with your hands , squishing them together as if you were about 8 years old and making mud pies .
