<p> The prospect boggles the mind : the double murder trial of O.J. Simpson collapsing in mistrial and starting over again , as if the trial of the century had never happened . <p> Yet after a dramatic series of juror revelations and defense allegations about prosecutorial abuse this week , the unthinkable looms as highly possible , posing the most serious challenge yet to the integrity of the proceeding . <p> In a trial that has gyrated with surprises almost daily , this last week was like a spinning top . <p> " We 're on a timeline to disaster , " says University of Georgia law professor Ron Carlson . " It has all the ingredients for a mistrial to occur . " <p> Suggestions from excused juror Jeanette Harris that jurors may be discussing the case among themselves and that outsiders , including sheriffs ' deputies , are interacting with jurors in ways that could color their views , could add up to a fatal poisoning of the jury . <p> Late Thursday , sheriff 's deputy John Castro announced that Judge Lance Ito " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harris . <p> " Judge Ito has a terrible problem , " says famed Jackson , Wyo. , trial lawyer Gerry Spence . " One part of him is saying he has to look into these allegations . Another part says , ' If I look in , I know what I 'll find and I 'll have to mistry this case . ' He does n't want to look , but he has to look . " <p> In addition , the illness of three jurors Thursday that prompted Ito to postpone testimony until at least Tuesday highlights the possibility that the trial could run out of jurors . <p> Six of the 12 alternate jurors have already been pressed into service , shrinking the pool at a rate that could cause the number of regular jurors to dip below 12 - months before the trial is expected to end . <p> Both sides insist they do not want a mistrial , even if misconduct or illness depletes the jury . <p> " We will fight to the end , " defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> District Attorney Gil Garcetti also said he would never seek a mistrial because such a move by the prosecution would prevent a retrial . <p> While the defense could seek a mistrial without consequence , the Constitution , which bars exposing defendants to double jeopardy for the same crime , would kick in if the prosecution seeks a mistrial . <p> But Judge Lance Ito could declare a mistrial on his own and leave open the possibility of a new trial , if he deems the problems serious enough . <p> Whether the revelations thus far add up to " legal necessity " requiring a mistrial is open to hot debate . <p> Southwestern University law professor Robert Pugsley says the improprieties would have to be more serious - a juror being bribed , for example - to warrant mistrial . <p> " If the judge did so ( declared a mistrial ) without the consent of the defendant , " says Pugsley , " he would run the risk of it being declared ( by an appellate court ) that there was not legal necessity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> But others point to Ito 's daily admonition to jurors - telling them not to discuss the case amongst themselves - as a central element to the trial 's integrity , a tenet that may have been repeatedly violated if ex-juror Harris ' depiction is accurate . <p> Cochran 's allegations that the prosecutor and others are conspiring to follow and harass witnesses and dig up dirt on jurors because of an " obsession to win " are also weighty if true . In a legal system weighted from the start toward giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt , prosecutorial abuse can spoil a trial . <p> " We think Big Brother is doing more than watching in this case , " Cochran said at a news conference . <p> Garcetti , while not specifically denying the defense team 's charges , told reporters , " We are seeking the truth and we 're doing it in an ethical , professional and honorable way . " <p> Cochran also said he had never heard of continuing investigations of jurors once the jury was seated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion in court to get her husband Melvin to move out . <p> The motion alleged he " pushed and shoved me , " apparently contradicting her statement in a jury questionnaire that she had no experience with domestic abuse . <p> She is still married to Melvin , who denies the abuse charge . She said Thursday the earlier affidavit " did n't even cross my mind " when she filled out the jury questionnaire . <p> But Ito excused her from the jury because of the discrepancy . <p> The prospect of a second trial for the best-known celebrity murder defendant in American history poses daunting questions about picking a new jury and retrying a case that has riveted attention for months : <p>  --  Picking another jury . It was difficult enough for Ito to find jurors untainted by the massive pretrial publicity for the first trial . But for a possible second trial , large chunks of the populous have even more intimate knowledge of the strategy and evidence of both sides . Picking 12 impartial jurors could take months . <p> " Unless they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountain , everyone in the world knows all the principals in the case , " says jury consultant Sonya Hamlin . " You 'd have to use a totally different way of picking a jury . " <p> Instead of asking if prospective jurors have heard of the case , Hamlin says the inquiry would have to be whether they have the stamina to hear it again . <p>  --  Retrying the case . Even though the crime and the evidence are the same , experts say that every facet of a second trial would change - the behavior of the judge , the prosecution , the defense , even the media . <p> " No matter what has happened before , the second trial will be completely different from the first , " says L.A. defense lawyer Danny Davis . <p> And Davis should know ; he 's retried several cases , including the notorious McMartin preschool child molestation case . The first trial ended in 1990 in a hung jury on some charges . Defendant Raymond Buckey was acquitted in the second . <p> The biggest change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far shorter , far more efficient ; everybody better do it differently . " <p> The first McMartin trial took 3 1/2 years including preliminary proceedings ; the second , 3 1/2 months . <p> One key factor that could keep a Simpson retrial short : Simpson may run low on cash . The legal bill for Simpson 's " dream team " runs an estimated $ 20,000 a day . <p> Both sides would also learn from the first trial , discard witnesses and change strategies , says Hamlin . <p> " There 'll be none of the surprises in opening statements , because we know it all already , " she says . <p> The intense media spotlight also would fade , at least somewhat . <p> And even the judge , if he runs a second trial , may change his ways , Davis predicts . <p> " Ito ai n't going to be the same either the next time . He 'll quit pampering the lawyers and take better control . Maybe he 'll even get rid of the hourglasses . " <p> Contributing : Sally Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @
