Friendly skies ? Fiendish skies is more like it . As 1995 takes off , the U.S. airline industry is lumbering away from what looks like its fourth straight year of monumental losses . The red ink since 1990 totals almost $13 billion , reports the Air Transport Association , a Washington , D.C. industry trade group . Over the same time , more than 120,000 employees were laid off by the airlines . No wonder that for most travelers  --  whether on business trips or vacation  --  flying has turned into a 100-proof headache . You know the gripes : crowded cabins , aging aircraft , tasteless or nonexistent meals , abominable flight delays ( especially in winter ) and , now , increased safety worries , particularly about commuter aircraft . And we have n't even mentioned the frustration caused by the roller-coaster fare structures that Rube Goldberg could n't have dreamed up . Thankfully , though , there are preemptive moves you can make that will ensure smoother air travel . And if , despite your efforts , the best-laid plans still go awry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you overcome obstacles . We canvassed dozens of industry analysts , veteran fliers , consumer advocates and travel agents to find out how you can avoid problems and get the best possible airline deals . Here 's what you need to know : PLANNING AHEAD Work with a techno-travel pro . The value of a travel agent is directly related to experience and his or her facility with computer reservations systems ( CRSs ) . Such systems post 100,000 fare changes every day , as airlines try to balance the supply of seats against the demand for tickets by continually adjusting prices . CRS systems not only list hundreds of ever-changing fares and make your reservation but also provide access to up-to-the-minute travel-related databases . Wherever you 're headed , you can ask your agent for helpful printouts on , say , theater listings , health advisories , currency exchange , tourist attractions or English-language help lines in foreign countries . New service-oriented software programs like AccuSystem and Aero , developed by major travel companies and available only to travel agents , further streamline the process . Every time your agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your frequent-flier membership programs as well as all your travel preferences for seats , special meals , connecting airports and more . In addition , quality-control software , available through mega-agencies such as Carlson Wagonlit , American Express , Thomas Cook , USTravel and Rosenbluth , reviews your entire reservation after it has been created to continue searching for savings on the flights you 've booked . To nail the best possible fares , your agent is bound to be your best ally . The bigger the city you 're visiting and the more flexible you are about travel dates and connections , the more fare options you have . For example , from Chicago to San Francisco , there are literally hundreds of choices of carriers , times and fares , all of which have exacting rules , deadlines , restrictions  --  and fares that continually shift . To snare the least-limiting current fare on your own can require dozens of phone calls to several carriers ( though there are alternatives ; see the next section ) . However , your agent 's CRS display screen gives you instant access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount fares , check low-fare carriers first . Despite the advantages of working with a veteran agent , some consumers prefer to book flights and arrange for ticket delivery on their own . If you 're among them , the first step to a low fare is to check prices at a no-frills , upstart or niche carrier , such as Southwest , Reno Air , Kiwi or ValuJet . These feisty outfits now serve most major hubs in the U.S. in at least a limited way , and they 're the main reason air fares have been kept as low as they are for the past couple of years . For example , Kiwi 's basic unrestricted round-trip fare from New York City to Orlando is $138 , compared with a seven-day restricted fare of $306 or a $546 unrestricted fare on Delta . Once you 've got the ticket price quote from an upstart , call one of the seven majors . Many carriers , such as Northwest and American , offer competitive prices that match  --  and even sometimes beat  --  the no-frills fares . Also , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the West Coast , will be competitive on price as well . If you prefer to shop by computer instead of by phone , you can get access to the same information that agents see on CRS screens by going on-line . You can make all of your own arrangements , and then , by selecting an on-screen option , have the booking confirmed by a travel agent or an airline reservations clerk , who will mail the tickets to your home . To use these popular self-booking systems  --  Eaasy Sabre , Worldspan Travelshopper and the Official Airline Guide Electronic Edition  --  you will need a personal computer with a modem and a subscription to one of the on-line services , such as America Online , CompuServe or Prodigy ( about $10 a month for basic service , plus extra charges as applicable ) . The drawbacks : You wo n't be able to arrange for a seat assignment , nor can you print out your boarding pass , as travel agents can . Reserve a seat you like ... Travel and gate agents can call up " seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you the locations of engines ( such the noisy , tail-mounted ones ) , galleys , lavatories and spacious bulkheads , often favored by parents with small children or people with long legs . Exit rows also frequently provide extra legroom . Ask to Look at the diagrams , and then request a seat in a location you prefer . ... And the type of meal you want . Special meals , such as low sodium , vegetarian , kosher and the like , are offered by virtually all the airlines and must be reserved in advance . But even if you do n't order anything special , be warned : Many carriers are scaling back food service to snacks for flights shorter than 90 minutes . If you 're booked on a couple of connecting flights , you could end up flying as long as four hours ( counting delays ) with nothing but peanuts to munch . Solution : Pack your own food . " I always bring a CARE package of bottled water , fruit and bagels when I fly , " says veteran traveler Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm in Morristown , N.J. Plan an early departure . Early-morning flights offer the greatest rerouting flexibility if bad weather disrupts air traffic . Leaving before , say , 9 a.m. will also minimize your chance of falling into system-wide snarls that can compound , hour by hour throughout the day , if one or two key hubs , like Chicago or Denver , get socked in . Consider secondary airports , Although flying to Chicago 's Midway Airport instead of O'Hare , or to Orange County 's John Wayne instead of LAX , wo n't always reduce your aggravation or travel time , these less clogged airports can be more convenient . If you must connect , try to do so through the smaller markets or hubs  --  Cincinnati instead of Chicago , for instance , or Charlotte rather than going through Atlanta . CHECKING IN Arrive early . Thinner airline staffs often mean fatter lines at check-in . If you have your seat assignment , then you can check your bag with a skycap at the curb , bypassing the check-in counter entirely , and head straight for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even earlier if possible , advises Jeffrey Harrow , president of Travel One , a Mount Laurel , N.J. travel management firm . " If you 're there early , " he notes , " and there 's a problem , you may be able to catch a flight on another carrier . " If troubles arise , head for the phone . Canceled flight ? A three-hour delay because of " equipment problems " ? Do n't hang out at the gate . Immediately head for a pay phone to get rerouted by calling your travel agent 's hot line , the airline 's central 800 reservation number or its number at an airport in another city ( where phone lines may be blissfully free ) . Chances are , you 'll get rebooked quicker that way . " It 's usually a waste of time to wait at the gate area when it 's crowded and there 's a lot of commotion , " says Chris Chiames at the Air Transport Association . You will usually be rebooked on your original line 's next available flight . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use your ticket on another airline , which may have a timelier departure  --  sometimes it works . Also , when a really horrific delay occurs , the full-service airlines occasionally pay for a hotel room or a missed connection , but none of them will offer . You must make the request . Tag and secure your bags . In 1993 , Department of Transportation ( DOT ) surveys showed 5.6 lost bags per 1,000 passengers , down almost two bags since 1990 . One big reason : wider use of bar-coded tags and sophisticated luggage sorting systems that rely on laser-scan technology . Nonetheless , damaged , stolen and misrouted luggage is No. 2 on the DOT 's list of complaints ( flight delays top the list ) . To avoid snafus , always double-check luggage stickers or tags placed on your bags by skycaps or airline personnel , and make sure that your own luggage tag , complete with name , address and phone , is secure and visible . Although no luggage is tamperproof , you can protect your bags with a built-in combination lock or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that soft-sided baggage allows thieves to feel around for valuables like video cam eras . In any event , never pack anything you prize in bags you check , nor jewelry , cameras , electronics or medication . Carry valuables with you . And then do n't forget to mark your name and address on carry-on hags , in case you leave them on the plane . CHECKING OUT If baggage woes hit , move fast . Roughly 98% of all bags reported lost are eventually returned to their owners , usually within 24 hours . To get a swift recovery , report lost or damaged bags to the airline 's claims office immediately . If you must have special attire for , say , a social or business occasion and there 's little chance your bag will arrive in time , keep insisting you need help . The full-service airlines might give you immediate compensation . Demand satisfaction . If your problem or gripe is not satisfactorily handled by airport personnel , phone or write to the carrier 's consumer affairs department . " Airlines do listen to complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait a while for a response  --  a few weeks to a month . You may also want to address your complaint to the DOT 's Office of Consumer Affairs ( 400 Seventh St. S.W. , Washington , D.C. 20590 ; 207-366-2220 ) . Be specific about your beef and how you expect the airline to respond . " Basically , " says Norman Strickman , chief of the DOT 's consumer affairs division , " if you want compensation , ask for it . If you 're looking for something in particular , request that . " Enclose copies of tickets and any other relevant documentation , such as store receipts of lost or stolen items . Enlist reinforcements . If the airline 's response still does n't measure up , get your travel agent to press your case through the carrier 's sales department . Alternatively , you could opt for mediation . The American Society of Travel Agents has a consumer affairs division ( 703-739-2782 ) that mediates between its travel partners ( airlines , hotels and the like ) and its customers . And , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : $49 a year and up ; 800-82-4272 ) maintains a staff of mediators . Happy flying ! <p>
