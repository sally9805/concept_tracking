Timothy Waring was an apprentice , but , unlike most apprentices in the stories we hear about , during those long-ago days of the Revolution , he liked being an apprentice . He liked his kind master , old Mr. Fielding , the editor of the Fielding Gazette , in the town of Fielding in upper New York . He was proud that he had a part in getting out one of the comparatively few newspapers published in 1776 in the American colonies . <p> Being a bound boy meant that he had signed a contract to serve Mr. Fielding until his eighteenth birthday , but though that was six long years away , Timothy did n't mind . More than anything in the world , he wanted to be the editor of a newspaper , as his hero Benjamin Franklin had been , and nowhere could he learn his trade better than in the office where he was now an apprentice . Already he could set type and he could even run the presses . He was looking forward eagerly to the day when he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news for the paper . " What , Timmy ? A day off during the week ? A fine apprentice you are ! " <p> It was a hot afternoon in early July , and Mr. Fielding 's spectacles slipped farther and farther down his nose as he paused from setting type to stare down at his embarrassed helper . <p> " Oh-no , sir , not a day off , " said Timothy , twisting his leather apron in his hot hands . " I would n't have to leave until five , after the paper has gone to press . I can walk home in three hours and we 'll have a late supper . Then in the morning I 'll be up before dawn and back here in plenty of time to deliver the papers . You see , sir , now that John is away at the war , I 'm the eldest and it 's Mother 's birthday and I always have helped her celebrate it before .... " <p> Mr. Fielding nodded slowly as he looked down into the eager , freckled face . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a son willing to walk over fifteen miles of rough country road and back again in order to share his birthday supper . But Mr. Fielding 's son and wife had been lost at sea many years before as they were returning from a visit to England . He had lived alone since then , although Timothy had shared the big house with him five nights out of every week since the beginning of the boy 's apprenticeship . How much the master missed the shy , quiet boy when he left to spend Sunday on his widowed mother 's tiny farm he would not have admitted even to himself <p> " Well , yes , I 'll let you off this time , but do n't you be asking me favors like this too often . You may have my mare to ride and take good care of her . See to it that you are back promptly at seven in the morning . " At this point , Mr. Fielding reached into his pocket and laid a coin in Timmy 's hand . " You deserve it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . " <p> " Oh , sir- , " cried Timothy , struggling for words to express the gratitude that welled up within him . His regular wages must go to his mother each week for necessities , but now the coin would buy her a birthday gift . " I'll-I 'll always do the best I can for you , sir . " <p> " Well , see that you do , " said Mr. Fielding gruffly , though his gray eyes twinkled above the spectacles perched at the end of his nose . " And now run along with you . The paper wo n't be going to press at five o'clock this day . " <p> Timothy stopped short in the act of taking off his apron . " Do you think a post rider might still come tonight ? " <p> *That I do , " was the firm answer , " even though the Tories do say the whole scheme has fallen through . My bones may be old , but they 're seldom mistaken , and they tell me that the Declaration of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front page for the story , and I 'll hold the presses until midnight at least . It wo n't be my fault if my subscribers tomorrow do n't read the best piece of news they 've heard in a lifetime . " <p> The road stretched before Timothy , golden with sunlight , as he jogged along toward home . Nellie , the mare , seemed to understand that she was carrying him to some special celebration , for she cantered briskly along the yellow ribbon of road despite the dust and the heat . He had even forgotten the shiny new pair of scissors he had bought as a birthday gift for his mother . He was thinking again of what all the people in the thirteen colonies were thinking that day . Each colony had sent delegates to a convention to consider an important paper called the Declaration of Independence , and if they decided to sign , it meant that they declared the colonies free and independent of Great Britain . There were those who thought the delegates would never dare to affix their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treason by the mother country If the American Revolution failed , what would be their punishment ? <p> " It takes brave men , Nellie , to run a risk like that , " said Timothy . " Oh , I hope the post riders come tonight in time for Mr. Fielding to put the story in tomorrow 's paper . " <p> All week the town had waited anxiously for word from Philadelphia . There were no telegraph wires , radios , telephones , or TVs in those days to carry the news . Instead , messengers on swift horses rode from town to town . It was known throughout the colonies that as soon as a decision had been reached by the delegates in Philadelphia , post riders would be sent in every direction . The days dragged on , and the suspense had grown harder and harder to bear , as no messenger appeared . <p> And then Timothy forgot about the plight of the colonies in the warmth of his mother 's greeting . She had not expected him so early and she was delighted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nine-year-old brother , helped him rub down the horse , while Towser , the pup , barked joyfully at his heels , and then there was time for a swim in the creek before supper . It was quite a distance from the house , across the oat field , but still within hearing of the supper bell . When it rang after a half hour of cool splashing , the boys dressed hurriedly and picked their way carefully between the rows back to the house . <p> " I declare , " said Timothy sheepishly , as he sat down at the table , " if I did n't leave my shoes and socks down by the creek ! What do you think of that ? " <p> Tom and Jenny , his sister , laughed gleefully , for Tim 's forgetfulness of shoes and socks seemed to prove to them that he was still a country boy at heart . They had been feeling quite in awe of his new dignity as apprentice to the town 's editor , and now they were secretly pleased that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to mind . " Sit right down and eat your supper , Timmy . There will be plenty of time afterwards to fetch your shoes . " It was a merry meal , with fried chicken and hot biscuits and a birthday cake that Jenny had baked as a surprise . Timothy 's tongue was loosened at last , and Mr. Fielding would never have thought him to be the same quiet boy who worked for him . <p> " My apprenticeship will be over when I 'm eighteen , " he boasted as he spread a hot biscuit with raspberry jam , " and then Im going to be an editor . " <p> " You could n't ever be an editor at eighteen , " said Jenny in disbelief . <p> Benjamin Franklin was-when he was seventeen , " Timothy answered triumphantly . <p> " But , son , " his mother reminded him , " it takes a great deal of money to own your own paper . " <p> " Well , Benjamin Franklin did , and he did n't have much money to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , and he 's so good to me . I wish I could do something for him . " <p> After supper there was a letter from John , the soldier brother , to be read aloud , and then the conversation turned to the Declaration of Independence . Darkness came upon them almost before they realized it , as they sat together on the doorstep , talking of the hopes that beat high in the heart of every patriot . Only when they were ready for bed did Timothy remember his shoes . <p> " I do n't want you boys trampling on my oats in the dark , " said their mother . " You 'd better go around by the road and take a lantern with you . " <p> It was a good suggestion , for they could scarcely see their way in front of them , except for the tiny ray of light . The road was deserted and there was no sound , except those noises which one may always hear on summer nights-the rustling of trees , the occasional chirp of a drowsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings make as it flies through the darkness . The boys followed the ditch that ran alongside the road , holding their lantern low so that they might see when they reached the narrow footbridge that would carry them across to the lane that led to the creek . Then , just as they found it , the quiet was broken by a low groan . <p> " What 's that ? " asked Timothy , holding his lantern high above his head so that its rays might reach farther into the night . <p> The light revealed nothing , but another sound came from the direction of the deep gulch-a few words mumbled which they could not understand . Frightened though they were , neither thought of turning back . They retraced their steps , and by the light of their lantern , they found a horse that had fallen into the ditch with his rider pinned beneath him . <p> The next half hour was never very clear in their memory . Tom ran back for his mother and sister and the four of them succeeded in dragging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow they carried him to the house , and under the kindly care of Mrs. Waring , he revived . He did not seem to be seriously hurt , but he was certainly unable to continue his journey that night . <p> " But I must go on to Fielding , " the rider protested . He tried to rise , but fell back on the pillows . " I am a post rider- " <p> " From Philadelphia ? " asked Timothy . <p> The man nodded weakly . <p> " Tell me the news , and I shall ride with it at once to the editor of the Fielding Gazette . " <p> Thus it happened that Timothy and Nellie made the journey back to town that night . It was hard going , with neither the moon nor a star to guide them . By only the fair rays of his lantern , the boy kept the horse on the road . It was not the ride that every boy dreams of taking sometimea wild gallop for freedom or a swift , thrilling dash to a rescue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along an unseen road , with only the call of a whippoorwill and the fearsome screech of an owl for company . What a relief it would have been to put spurs to the mare ! But he remembered the fate of the post rider 's horse . Yes , it was a braver thing that Timothy Waring did that night in proceeding slowly and cautiously than if he had ridden at breakneck speed with a regiment of Redcoats behind him . <p> The one spot of light in the town was in the newspaper office , and old Mr. Fielding looked up in surprise when an excited , barefoot boy rushed in . <p> " It 's been signed , Mr. Fielding ! The Declaration of Independence has been signed ! " Without a word , the editor walked over to the type stand and began setting up the story as Timothy told it to him . And the next morning when the subscribers of the Gazette opened their papers , they read the news with rejoicing . <p> Timothy Waring read something else . To his great surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before in bringing the news to Fielding . Moreover , the item said that his master , as a token of the trust he placed in him , intended to make him his heir and-if when he was eighteen years old , he had served his apprenticeship well-his partner on the Gazette . <p> " Oh-Mr . Fielding-I-I thank you , " the boy stammered , flushing at the unexpected joy of the news and wriggling his toes with embarrassment . <p> " It 's about time you said , Thank you , " ' said Mr. Fielding gruffly , though he knew that Timothy had read the item only a moment before . Then the usual twinkle came back into his eyes as his gaze traveled downward . " Come onson . Let 's go down to the store . I think my new partner needs a new pair of shoes .
