<p> THE blind man moved with upraised hands through the slow-moving downtown traffic . Perhaps it was an innate instinct for survival which led the man shuffling past battered taxis without pause . Instead , he stopped at the window of a top-of-the-line Mercedes . He did not leave empty handed : The Kuwaiti couple inside passed out a few notes . <p> Gulf Arabs ' high-profile <p> The scene is repeated a thousand times each day in Cairo , the Arab world 's most populous city . Petty sellers and beggars , often only small children , weave in and out of the round-the-clock traffic , offering up their cheap wares and pitiful infirmities to the charity of the rich . <p> Since the Gulf crisis , more than 30,000 well-heeled Kuwaitis have taken up temporary residency here . Along with thousands of other Gulf Arabs , their high-profile presence has thrown into sharp relief the growing gap between the oil-rich Gulf Arabs and their poorer , more populous neighbors . <p> The manicured refugees are a common sight in the lobbies of Cairo 's five-star hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by their overweight and overdressed children , Filipino nanny in tow . <p> There are more than 14 million people living in Cairo , the acute shortage of apartments forcing at least a tenth of these to live in cemeteries . The economy is stagnant and unemployment is estimated at more than 25 percent . At the same time , child labor appears to be on the increase as families struggle to keep up with the rising costs of everything from food to schools . <p> Though residents are loathe to speak openly of their troubles , there are growing indications that life for the average , poor Egyptian is becoming almost intolerable . <p> " We 're living . Thanks be to God , we 're living , " says Hamdy , a middle-aged resident of Old Cairo , the densely-populated ancient quarter . " There were more opportunities before . Twenty years ago there was money , there were chances . <p> " But now , you ca n't get a man who has six or seven kids and can afford to keep them . Some have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send them to work . He has to do this more and more . " <p> As we spoke at a corner cafe , waif-like boys in worn pajamas and rubber shoes raced in and out of the busy intersection , leaping onto the tailgates of passing trucks . A broken sewer main had turned the crossing into a lake of fetid water . <p> From a few doors away came the din of a metalworking shop . One of the workers was an unkempt boy of no more than 12 years old . When asked about the boy 's employ , the overseer became irritated and claimed he was his own 16-year-old son . <p> During the Gulf war , President Bush spoke of a " new world order . " When Egypt sent more than 38,000 troops to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Storm , there was also talk of a new economic order . At issue was the lack of investment and aid from the ultra-rich Gulf states to poorer Arab countries like Egypt . <p> Egypt and Syria are to maintain troops in the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In return , the Gulf states are expected to greatly increase their financial support of those countries . <p> Finance ministers from the six Gulf states agreed April 22 to establish a lending fund for the development of Arab countries . Early reports say the fund will have an initial capital of $5 billion and will favor private sector , rather than governmental , development projects . Gulf states ' showcase fund <p> Initial reaction to the news was muted , with observers noting that the sum was not large when considering the billions already tranferred to the region in the past two decades . The fund was described as " a showcase " and " a means of leverage . " <p> " For a few days after the war they spoke about the need to address the issue of development as a basis of any security arrangement , " says an Arab academic . " But all the ideas about the redistribution of wealth have been dropped from their agenda very quickly . " <p> Of Cairo 's worsening poverty , he says : " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific wealth buried under some feudal societies . Other , very large and very old cultures have nothing . <p> " Cairo is the most important city in the Arab world and it is also once again its political center , its cultural forum . Part of the problem is management , profiteering , the absence of planning . But part of it is the fact that Arab funds to Egypt have been very small compared with its relative importance , " he says . <p> Cairo-based economists expect the coming year to bring even harder news for the already-pressed public . In recent days the Egyptian government has announced price increases of more than 20 percent for a wide range of goods including gasoline , public transport , and electricity . Further price rises are expected in the coming weeks . <p> The austerity measures are part of a tough series of reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund . For more than three years , Egypt has been negotiating a new agreement to reduce the country 's $35 billion foreign debt . <p> " Now even people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the owner of a ramshackle photo studio .

They gather rubbish and sort it , kids of nine or ten , " he says . <p> " The bosses are exploiting the fact that families need money . They give the kids little money . " <p> Muhammad estimated a day 's wage at five Egyptian pounds , less than $2 . Many , he says , work only for the food they receive . <p> The quality of peoples ' diets is also falling , as the price of meat and other basic foodstuffs rises beyond the reach of most people . The lack of public services is also creating widespread but unreported health problems , exacerbated by the already poor health of children and women . <p> On Friday market day in one part of Old Cairo , customers crush around crude wooden carts piled high with the refuse of nearby slaughter houses . <p> Amid a swarm of flies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several minutes before bringing down the price of a small goat 's head .
