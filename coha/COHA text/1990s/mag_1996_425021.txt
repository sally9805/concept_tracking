Marie wanted to die . She 'd been wanting to for most of her life , I think , and was n't it time ? She was asking me . She 'd been thinking about how to kill herself for months , years , especially the last few weeks . Now she knew how she would do it and was simply focusing on when . She was eighty and a couple of her teeth had recently fallen out , her stomach was swollen , food made her sick ; she was in pain all over , the worse pain she 'd ever had , she said , though every pain throughout her whole life was always the worst . Over the years , the hundreds of times she was sick , each time she was " deathly sick . " Each pain for decades had been " the most horrible pain " she 'd ever felt . You never knew . She 'd turn the least matter into melodrama , managing her life neurotically , even from the beginning , I 've come to believe , by pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she might as well just go on and get it over with , did n't I think so , too ? I told her that such a thing had to be up to her , no one else . But did n't I think she might as well ? What did she have to live for ? She had terrible noise in her ears and could n't hear , she 'd disconnected her phone , no one called anyway , she had no friends . She had lived for fifteen years as an almost total recluse , and other than a sister she hated and another son she had n't heard from in thirty years , there was only me . She could n't see her soap operas except as a blur , she was shaky , trembly , she got out of breath walking from her room to the front of the house , so before being too helpless , while she could still manage , was n't it time ? She had n't bathed or showered in a couple of years , I think : she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub . She sponged off , she said . But she was still able to go to the toilet on her own , she was still feeding herself , though lately only oatmeal , buttered bread , and a little yogurt ; anything else made her vomit . She was weak and getting weaker . " No , I 'm not going to the doctor , " she told me . " I know what he 'd do , he 'd put me in the hospital and I 'd be kept alive for no reason or left in a nursing home , and I do n't want that . I want to lay down right here in my own bed and go to sleep and not wake up . You do n't know how many times I 've prayed I would n't wake up . Every night I go to sleep praying , dear God , please , just let me die and not wake up . So I 'm going to do it . But I ca n't by myself . You 'll have to help me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills . Years before , she 'd saved a stash of pills for the purpose , but when she could n't afford new medicine one year , she 'd used the stash instead . Recently , though , she 'd gotten a prescription for one hundred Xanax , a sedative . I called in the order for her and picked up the pills from the drugstore an hour later , a regular brownish cylinder with a white cap . Marie said she was going to take them that night at about eleven or eleven-thirty , her usual bedtime , when it was quiet and peaceful . I did n't know whether she really would . She had talked suicide too often . But the pills would put her right to sleep , then all I 'd have to do was slip a bag over her head and wrap it airtight around her neck with a scarf . Not rubber bands . They might leave telltale lines . She showed me the small plastic trash bag and the blue silky scarf . She 'd already tried the bag on to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . A large bag would retain too much air and take longer . She 'd read that in a book from the Hemlock Society . She gave me the bag and scarf . " Now , you just go on about your business , " she said . " Tonight when I 'm ready I 'll call you . " I went to my room and tried to think . If this was for real , if this time she was actually going to do it , was there anything I needed to consider ? Feelings , emotions ? No . My feelings for Marie were fairly reconciled . I came into this world out of her body , or the physical me did , so there was that kind of blood bond , but I did n't like her as a person . I was ashamed of her as a mother . I would n't miss her . In a kind of gruesome test , I slipped the bag over my head for size and found that it barely covered my neck . I could see the scarf not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and the final act getting messy . Marie would struggle , even zonked on Xanax , and she would be clawing the thing to get free , to breathe . The Hemlock Society body said that this was common . I could see myself trying to hold her hands down or , frozen , just standing there , watching . If she scratched herself or I somehow bruised her , that might look bad to a coroner . It might look like murder . And to some degree it would be . The word hung in my mind . Murder . A vague image , the word itself had no resonance . But helping to end someone 's life , no matter how sick and sad and miserable , is helping to kill a human being . And in this instance , if it came about , I would be helping to kill my own mother . Could I do it ? More precisely , at the last moment would I ? I drove to town and got a box of slightly larger plastic bags . If it was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size , not too small . The last act should go smoothly , not with a struggle , not with my hands fighting hers , the meanness of that . I stopped at a liquor store and got a bottle of vodka . Might need some thing to fuzz the edges afterward . It would be my first drink in months . It was now about three in the afternoon . I tapped at her door and went in , a rare visit . I 'd been in her room perhaps three times in two years . She was sitting in her chair watching her daily soap operas . For the past two and a half years I 'd provided this place for her in my house , a room perhaps twenty by twenty feet , also a sort of efficiency setup with cooking facilities , a refrigerator , and an adjoining bath . In this one room she stayed alone and kept to herself . She never left the house . She 'd leave a list of the groceries and medicine she needed along with a signed check on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her Social Security was just enough to pay for what she wanted . She 'd show me her bank statement at the end of every month with only five or ten dollars left in her account . When we talked , it was usually when she was in the kitchen and I also happened to be there . But it would n't be a conversation . She might ask my opinion on the weather or some TV news item . Typically she 'd say , " Do you think it 's going to rain today ? " I 'd start to answer , " Well , no , I think  --  " and she 'd immediately interrupt to disagree : " That 's what the weatherman says but they do n't know . They said it was going to rain yesterday , there was n't a cloud in the sky . I do n't think they have any idea what the weather 's going to be . I was going to make a salad but I do n't want to , I just do n't have the interest . Nothing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was like slop , I had to throw it all out . The arthritis in my hand is so bad , I took four of those pain pills , they did n't help a bit , I do n't know what I 'm going to do . I was going to make some macaroni and cheese but I do n't even want that now . Those ratty kids next door were playing so loud , hollering and carrying on , I could n't hear myself think . I wish that family 'd move away , they 're nothing but white trash . I saw the woman out in her yard yesterday wearing shorts , with big ol ' fat legs , I 'd be ashamed ... " She would talk like that forever if I listened . For about a minute I 'd pretend to , then I 'd simply walk away . If she began with a good word , her next word would qualify it and she 'd end up carping . She did n't like herself or , worse , she hated herself , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room . " How " bout a visit ? " I said . She got up from her chair . " Here , sit down . " " That 's all right , " I said ; she only had the one chair . " No , no , you sit here , I need to move anyway . " She sat on the edge of her bed and I sat in the chair facing her . The room was dirty and cluttered . I 'd offered to vacuum her carpet , but she said the noise drove her crazy and she did n't want me moving things around in there . I told her she did n't have to hear the noise , she could wait in the living room , but she said it was too bothersome . " Just leave it . I 'll do it , " she said . And never did . The carpet was spotted and matted where she 'd spilled food . " Well , " I said , and that was all . " It 's going to be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was decided . It was time . She was sick and it was probably a consumptive heart condition , that 's what her father died of , and with that you do n't get better , you just get worse . She 'd read up on the symptoms in her medical book  --  it starts with a shortness of breath and your stomach , you ca n't keep food down . That 's what was happening to her . Then it affected your kidneys and liver , they turned to mush , and you became bedridden and could n't go to the bathroom or feed yourself  --  you could n't eat anything anyway  --  and you 'd just lie there in agony and finally die . So she was ready . " Now , one thing I want you to do , " she said , " I do n't want you to tell my sister , or at least wait till you 've gotten rid of all my stuff , " cause she 'll just be over here in a minute picking through all my clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything . Promise you wo n't tell her Or I do n't care , do what you want , but I 'm telling you , I know how she 'll do , you do n't know how selfish she is . " And so on about how her sister had always taken and not given and had plenty of money and could afford to buy a new car every year and everything else she wanted . No forgiveness . About my brother and me , she said that she wished she 'd made a home for us , that she knew she 'd messed us up , especially Billy , she knew he 'd been the most hurt , but that it was too late now , she could n't go back and change what happened , and she 'd already cried herself out ; she had n't cried tears now in years . She 'd made a mess of her own life too , but she could n't change that either . I 'd heard it all before , the regrets , the bad times . I kept hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . She did n't . I tried to remember some good moments we 'd had together , some things I could mention so we could end with easier feelings . I could n't think of one . She probably loved me the best she could , but if there was a time when I was small that she hugged me , that I felt the warmth of a mother 's embrace , I could n't remember that either . So I sat while she talked . She had lived a lifetime . But at the end of a life , after eighty years of awareness , hopes , desires , after only one chance at this world as we know it , should n't there be a final comprehension , a summing up , a point at least for having been ? You live , for what ? I wanted her to say what living had meant to her , but she was talking incidentals : her extra glasses , they were good prescription glasses someone could use , do n't throw those away . She had put a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nice clean gown . Should she wash her hair ? No , she did n't need to . I could donate her clothes to charity or just burn them , but do n't let her sister have any . She had already thrown away a bunch of junk and straightened the room all she could . Straightening tired her out . She said to tell Billy she was sorry but that she could n't go back and make things different , and me , well , I could handle this , could n't I ? I told her truthfully that I did n't know . But she knew , she said , because I was always able to handle whatever came along , I never let problems bother me , did I ? Well , problems are problems , I said . But she knew that I could help her die , that I would n't let it bother me . She was sorry she did n't stick with my father , but she just could n't . She wanted to have fun , and then her life became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . She married other men so she could have a home for us , but it never turned out , she never got what she wanted , which was just to be happy and for us kids to be happy , but she could n't help any of that now , she could n't go back . She was just sorry about this and that and so on . She spoke , as usual , remorsefully , self-pityingly , but not exactly bitterly . It was as if she recited it all by rote : things happened , she could have done differently , but it was n't always her fault either , and then it was always too late . After the fact , it was always too late . She voiced no new insight , no particular understanding . I felt depressed , and after about an hour I got up . I 'd be back later , I said , and we could talk more then . Well , do n't worry about me , she said , I 'll call you when I 'm ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to read . It was five o'clock and I began to feel it was going to be a long night . She would n't do it , or she would fake it . She was involving me in another one of her emotional dramas . I might have to call the EMS . She was only going to become more disoriented , more helpless . I should probably start thinking about placing her in a nursing home . At six-thirty she was at my door . " I ca n't think about it anymore , " she said , " I want to just go on and do it , is that all right with you ? " " If you 're ready . " " Well , I 'm ready , I keep sitting back there thinking about it . Now , you 've got the bag ? And the scarf  --  do n't forget the scarf . " " They 're right here . " " All right , let 's get it over with . " We walked through the kitchen . She was hobbling feebly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since this morning . I 'm afraid I 'll throw up . " " But should n't you have something on your stomach , to keep the pills down ? How about a little buttered toast ? " " I do n't know , not buttered , maybe just a piece of dry toast . " I put a slice of bread in the toaster and followed her into her room . She sat on the edge of the bed . " Now , here 's what I 'm going to take , " she said . A couple of pill bottles stood on her bedside table . " This one 's fifty Wygesic , they 're my pain pills , they might help . These are Xanax , the ones you got today , and I had some more . There 's a hundred and thirty-eight altogether . That ought to do it if I do n't get too drowsy and fall asleep before I can take them all . " " You 're going to take a hundred and thirty-eight pills ? " " If I can get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow enough water . I 've got a pitcherful over there , you 'll have to get that for me . " She was opening the pill bottles . I felt numb . " Wait a minute . " I brought the toast from the kitchen on a napkin . " Get this on your stomach first . " She forced herself to chew several bites slowly , sipping also at a glass of water . She ate about half the toast , then immediately poured a few pills into her hand and swallowed them with water . She took another handful and another , one after the other as if on automatic . She was concentrating solely on what she was doing and not looking beyond her hands . Then her glass was empty . " More water , more water " Almost panicky . I got the pitcher and filled her glass . " Hey , go slower , " I said . " Take your time . " " I do n't want to fall asleep before I get them down . " " It 's okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and downed several more pills . She took off her glasses and laid them on the table . " Do n't throw those away , they 're good prescriptions , somebody can use them . " She swallowed more pills . I was only sitting in front of her , watching . A terrible feeling came over me , a weight of darkness . Here was this old , lonely woman actually going to die , killing herself . This was the last moment she would ever know , a worthless , measly last moment in a dismal , cluttered room in central Texas . She would never again see the two squirrels in the tree outside her window . Or the sky , the sun , the rain . This earth , this great , beautiful earth around her would be no more . She was going to die and nothing would be all . I had no words for what I felt except pity . Poor old woman . " Marie , " I said , " let me hug you . " I stood and leaned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against hers . I think she sort of patted my arm . " I love you , " I said . " I love you , too . " I sat back in the chair . It was the first time I 'd hugged her in years , and even in those years a quick hug was a mere politeness . This time was almost the same . It had not been exactly awkward but neither had it felt natural . My words , I love you , had been what , perfunctory ? Hers to me had sounded the same . There had been no clutch of emotion . She immediately went back to taking her pills , hurriedly , several at a time , one swallow after another , downing them with water . I filled her glass three times . She never looked up . We did n't speak . Then she did . " Well , that 's it . " She had swallowed 138 Xanax and 20 or so Wygesic . She started to lie back on her pillow and stopped . " Turn your back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . The book said people lose their bowels when they 're going , and I do n't want to make a mess . " I turned my head . When I looked again , she was lying on her back , the end of a towel showed between her knees . She had folded her hands on her stomach . " Now I 'm going to count , " she said . " That 's what I do to put myself to sleep . I read that once and it works . I start at a hundred and count backwards . I never get to one . I can get to twenty , fifteen sometimes , then I 'm always asleep . " She closed her eyes and started counting in a normal voice , " Ninety-nine ... ninety-eight ... ninety-seven ... " She counted as if by seconds , steadily , correctly . By eighty-five , her count had slowed , and she was several seconds between numbers . After eighty , she said seventy-eight , paused at length , picked up the slipped seventy-nine , and continued with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At sixty-six , I thought she was asleep . She 'd stopped counting . Finally she managed to repeat sixty-six and that was it . She was breathing deeply and snoring intermittently with her mouth slightly open . It was seven o'clock and beginning to get dark outside . I closed the curtains . I felt inept not to have closed them earlier . Then I did n't know how long to wait or if I should wait at all . I watched Marie breathing . If I touched her or shook her , would it rouse her ? The Xanax might not have worked . She might suddenly wake . How long would it take before she was so absolutely doped there would be no chance of waking her ? I imagined the moment I started to put the bag over her head , she would open her eyes . I waited perhaps fifteen minutes , then went to my room for the bag and scarf and came back . She had not moved . Her mouth was still slightly open , and she was breathing the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lifted one of them and it fell back . I nudged her shoulder . No reaction . I called her name , then louder , and shook her . No response . I walked through the house to shut the blinds and lock the doors . I took the phone off the receiver . If anyone knocked or called , I would n't be home . Did I need to think of anything else ? I could n't think . The bag was not a difficulty . I lifted her head from the pillow and slipped the plastic over easily , in a single movement . I did it as gently as I could and felt no weight in her head at all . Her neck was limber , entirely relaxed . Lifting her head again , I overlapped the loose ends of the bag and wrapped the scarf evenly twice around . But not tightly . I felt an odd tenderness and sadness . Poor Marie , I thought , your whole life so damned unhappy . I felt sorry for her . I snugged at the scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood over her and watched the bag filling and being drawn back against the outlines of her face , and for a time there was nothing else . Her breathing appeared easy , but soon it was slightly harder and the bag was being sucked tighter at her mouth . Her hands started to lift and I stopped them . She did n't struggle , Her hands did n't resist mine and she did n't strain or move . There was no strength or force in her . She was only breathing harder and lying completely still . Then she quietly stopped breathing . I waited . In another moment , her chin ticked and she almost drew a half breath . That was all . The bag was collapsed and molded against her face . Her body had not convulsed or shuddered . There was no sudden absence in the room . It seemed only that she was no longer entirely present . She might have still been alive . I thought I felt a faint pulse at her wrist and under my palm on her chest the bare tremor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to be sure so I waited . Perhaps five minutes . She remained absolutely inert . I loosed the scarf and pulled the bag from her head . Marie Brett had died at 7:25 in the evening , April 19 , 1995 . The big news that day was the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City . I sat beside her another hour . The lines in her face were gone . It was a smoothed face and did n't look quite like the Marie I remembered . Her mouth was still ajar . She had been a dirt-poor country girl , her parents sharecroppers from Alabama who moved to Texas . She claimed she graduated from high school , I think maybe she got to the tenth grade . She was a big girl , five ten , a little hefty . Not a bad face , probably attractive . She had nice teeth , an appealing feature . Growing up , she 'd worked in the fields like a man . When she was seventeen , she met my father , who was twenty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was during the Depression . Marie would walk by the barbershop on her way home from school and flirt with Charlie , the shineboy . They went to the movies together and kissed . She 'd never had a boyfriend . Charlie had never had a girlfriend . He was shorter than Marie and an introvert , a repressed soul . She was more outgoing , a girl who wanted to have fun . So they got married , each having no other choice . Charlie 's mother had been domineering , and Marie was , too . She married Charlie , she said , to get away from home . She had my brother and me by the time she was nineteen . Charlie worked as a farmhand , at a service station , then at a slaughterhouse , and finally as a postal clerk , a better job than he 'd ever hoped to expect . It offered security , a steady income . They made a down payment on a $1,400 house and bought furniture on credit from a mail-order catalogue . When the war came along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were everywhere . It was an exciting time . The world might end tomorrow . That 's when Marie decided to join the war effort , so to speak . She left her husband and kids and went off to frolic with the soldiers . She became a waitress in small-town cafes . She married six times , well , seven , if you count the one she married twice , the one who regularly beat her . Billy and I lived mostly with grandparents . We would see Marie in the summers , or she would appear occasionally with small , meaningless presents and play like everybody was happy . It 's probably not possible , but I 've tried to understand Marie beyond my , personal resentments What kind of person was she ? The word " unfortunate " comes to mind . Not " tragic . " To rise to that level , you would think a person would need first to aspire to something worthwhile , and Marie 's most articulate aspiration was " just to be happy , that 's all I ever wanted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a matter of degree , not a permanent condition . Or she may have pretended to happiness because she knew it was nowhere , an impossibility for her , and by never finding it , she essentially confirmed her self-image that she did n't deserve to be happy . She did n't like herself , for whatever reason , and that predetermined every relationship , every single dead-end path she took . It may well have been that simple . She never understood herself , or , if she did , some truths were too hard to face . Marie began early on to live in a world of pretense . Maybe we all do . The void all around is so immense and we 're so tiny , if we 're scared , if we 're not gritty enough to stand against defeat , then maybe pretense is a way to survive . It 's also a way to get lost , and that 's what happened to Marie : she pretended , she rationalized , she assumed a protective lie and became lost in a life that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell it , most of her life was occupied with " getting a man . " " I always had to have a man , " she said . If she could attract a man , pet a man to want her , this had to mean that she had some value , did n't it ? On the other hand , by being so easy that any man could screw her and did  --  " screwing " is what she called it  --  did n't that really prove she was of the least value , a throwaway ? Being little more than a fuck is being little more than faceless . Not surprisingly , when a man married her , she was immediately contemptuous of him : no doubt in her mind any man who would marry the likes of her had to be worthless , too . Of course , she only married men whom she could dominate , my father first , then the others . I was present at times when she verbally abused three of them . And they took it . But Marie would also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said her third husband was an Air Force pilot . He was n't . He was an enlisted man . Her fourth husband worked in a paint and body shop , but she said he was going to inherit a fortune , that his parents owned thousands of acres of prime wheat land . They did n't . They farmed about two hundred acres , of which each of their five children might one day be allotted a portion . Marie said her sixth husband was a partner in a big construction firm . He was an employee . Her seventh , she said , was a doctor , he knew a lot of medical terms . He turned out to be a nurse 's aide . When Marie was no longer a waitress but a fry cook , she claimed to be a dietitian . She told each husband she 'd been married only once , to my father , and that he 'd died . She also told each husband she was a few years younger than she really was . Was she smart ? She never learned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been compulsive , but I believe that she was at least of average intelligence . She did n't read books , even trashy ones . Or I take that back . She read my novels and said she liked them but she wished I would write a happy book ; my stories were so sad . She had no idea what I was about . She read magazines , the Ladies ' Home Journal type , and the tabloids . She read five of those every week . She watched soap operas and game shows . She worked simple crossword puzzles and played solitaire . She never had a friend , never another woman as a friend , and men were never friends , only people she screwed . What kind of person is it who never , not once in her life , has a real friend ? She set out to befriend two nieces once , then abruptly and maliciously alienated them . She alienated her sister , her two sons , all her husbands , and in the end , at sixty-five , when her last husband died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she became a recluse . It was n't so much she did n't want to see people ; she did n't want people to see her . She hated seeing herself . In her last years her flesh was globs of shapeless clabbered fat . She was no longer five ten but about five seven and half-blind and deaf . She had no outside interests , no property , no money . One house she had after a divorce she simply lived in without making the mortgage payments until the bank foreclosed  --  and she could have made the monthly payment , it was less than rent . She had clear title to her last house and simply gave it away to a thirty-six-year-old Cuban who " promised to take care of her . " She also gave him $12,000 cash , the sum of her late husband 's life insurance , and signed over the title to her car . Why ? I think it was n't so much the man conned her as she very calculatingly tried to buy him . She could n't , and probably knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " get a man . " It was typically self-defeating and she was left with nothing , the one thing she must have felt she deserved . So she 'd finally come to the end . She did n't have a religious faith or a belief in God . She pretended she did , she talked a lot about praying , but what she said she really believed was in nothing beyond this life . When it was over , that was it , a complete stop . Now she was lying on her back in a casket position , her eyes closed , her hands folded on her stomach . She had dressed in a thin , velvety black robe . Black . She had chosen that color for her last moments . And her choice may have been determined from birth . It seemed to me Marie was probably born with an unfortunate mix of conflicting traits that gave her nature a negative cast . Unhappiness was her fix and she caused unhappiness . Marie had tried suicide several times before . A psychiatrist might say these attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some help a time or two , which maybe sounds self-righteous , but each time I received only a kind of scorn in return . It was as if she considered help an interference . At the same time an offered kindness might make her cry , and she 'd be grateful , but then she 'd immediately distrust the kindness  --  what was it for ? Her suicide attempts were in all likelihood added ways to pull others more deeply into her miasma of sorrow . Finally , if we can say it just so happens that some people are fated to live miserable lives , then Marie , perhaps , was one of those . I felt sorry for her . I felt pity for her . It 's almost certain she never knew what it was to love or be loved wholeheartedly . She said she never meant to leave us kids . But she did .

You do n't leave your kids with a hole in their heart . I pulled the towel from between her legs . It was not soiled . I stuffed it and the plastic bag and the scarf and the pill bottles under a wad in the trash . There was nothing else to clear away . She 'd been wanting to die for a long time . When she realized she was at a point where she might be hospitalized or put in a nursing home , I think that decided it for her . She knew then that others would see her , that she would be exposed and no longer able to hide . So she would make another fantasy escape , and in her mind , if she could count on me to do the hard part , her part was merely a matter of going to sleep . She 'd had nightmares all her life .

We talked of nothing in particular , joked . After hanging up , I realized I had laughed too loudly . I would need to control myself better . I mixed another drink . About 9:30 I called the police , said I did n't know if I should call them , but I thought my mother had died in her sleep .
