A FEW YEARS AGO , JAMES ELLROY picked up a copy of Libra , Don DeLillo 's 1988 fictional meditation on the assassination of John F. Kennedy . At the time , Ellroy was a writer with a growing cult reputation ; his crime novels , set in his native Los Angeles  --  The Black Dahlia , The Big Nowhere , L.A. Confidential  --  had shown up on paperback best-seller lists and inspired much chatter among mystery fans : here was a guy who had pushed the genre way , way past hardboiled , into the realm of the terminally scalded . Ellroy seemed set on a path toward at least a shot at the ambition he had brashly revealed to interviewers who began seeking him out : " I want to be known as the greatest crime novelist who ever lived ! " <P> But something about Libra unsettled Ellroy . It was too good . DeLillo 's imagined journeys into the minds of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby , among others , had an eerie density and plausibility that Ellroy admired and did not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he remembers , " I said , ' Now I can never write about that subject . ' " <P> This thought immediately proved intolerable . How could the greatest **25;2521;TOOLONG be denied the subject of the greatest crime ? The answer struck Ellroy as simple : he could n't and would n't . " I said , ' Wait a minute . I can write an epic in which the assassination is only one crime in a long series of crimes . I can write a novel of collusion about the unsung leg breakers of history . I can do a tabloid sewer crawl through the private nightmare of public policy . ' " <P> Hence , American Tabloid ( Knopf ; 576 pages ; $25 ) . One month after publication , the novel is in its fourth printing and is creeping up the best-seller lists . It has attracted favorable , though sometimes nervous , reviews , understandably so . Recommending a book like American Tabloid  --  and there is no other book quite like American Tabloid-is most safely done to close friends , whose tastes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence ? What is their position on over-the-top sleaze and the reduction of nearly all human conduct to the narrow , insistent lust of self-interest ? Pushing such stuff to total strangers could get a person arrested . <P> If so , bring in the stenographer for a full confession . At a time when storytelling has largely been ceded to film-makers  --  when Pulp Fiction causes more chatter than pulp fiction  --  American Tabloid is a big , boisterous , rude and shameless reminder of why reading can be so engrossing and so much fun . The secret , of course , is language . When it is used well-which in Ellroy 's case means being pared down to taut , telegraphic sentences , subject-verb-blooey ! - one word is worth a thousand pictures . <P> The mayhem begins in 1958 , unfolding through the eyes and deeds of three men in their early 40s who have not yet learned that they are out-and-out psychopaths . Pete Bondurant is a former Los Angeles County deputy sheriff who now works for Howard Hughes ; Pete 's duties include overseeing the staffing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political smears , plus procuring drugs for and keeping process servers away from his billionaire boss . One day Teamsters head Jimmy Hoffa , who is being hounded by the Senate 's McClellan committee and chief counsel Robert Kennedy , calls to offer Pete $10,000 to kill a man in Miami .
