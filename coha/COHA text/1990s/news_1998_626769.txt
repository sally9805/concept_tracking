<p> After two decades of consideration , the Metropolitan Transit Authority will break ground Monday on the most ambitious construction project in its history . <p> Over the next five years , Metro will methodically - and messily - tear up and rebuild most of downtown Houston 's major streets . <p> When the project is done , the streets will be concrete instead of asphalt . They will have fewer traffic lanes and wider sidewalks , and they will be lined with trees , benches , covered bus stops and information kiosks . <p> Metro is promising to be as careful as possible in diverting traffic for construction - promising signs , traffic police , communication with building owners and motorist updates on its Web site . <p> At least two northbound and two southbound major streets , such as Smith/Louisiana and Milam/Travis , will be unobstructed at all times . <p> Metro also is facing the prospect of considerably higher construction costs than it anticipated . So far , most bids by private contractors have come in about 10 percent higher than expected , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished product will be worth the expense and the trouble , officials said . <p> " Downtown will get a whole new feel . We have all these pieces of architecture downtown , but if you look at the street , it 's rather unbecoming , " said Robert Eury , president of Central Houston Inc . <p> " When you really start looking around , the streets are in amazingly poor shape , " he said . <p> Still , it is fair to wonder why a regional transit authority - which normally runs buses - is giving its principal member city such a large gift - $ 177 million in federal and local transit funds going toward street repair . <p> City of Humble officials , who have filed a lawsuit to withdraw from Metro , have wondered more than once . <p> The Federal Transit Administration , in fact , was not originally fond of the idea , saying it benefited cars more than public transportation . <p> Nor was Metro 's board of directors happy when the idea was first floated by the public works director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1979 lunch speech , Jimmie Schindewolf suggested that since Metro buses chew up the streets , maybe Metro ought to chip in some cash toward their repair . <p> The downtown fix-up was formalized in 1983 after a rail plan was defeated by voters . It was dropped in the late 1980s and then picked up by former Mayor Bob Lanier when rail was canceled again in 1992 . <p> Now the project finally will commence , even as two of Metro 's newest board members voice concerns that would lead to more delays . <p> " Most of us feel like it 's been five lifetimes , " Eury said . <p> After some convincing , the FTA will help fund the project - but only those traffic lanes dedicated to bus use . Normally , this would be a single right-hand lane , but Metro has argued that its buses use two lanes , since they often pass each other through downtown . <p> The FTA also will help fund landscaping and other sidewalk improvements on the right side of the street . But it wo n't give money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . <p> The Houston Downtown Management District is doing that through a special assessment on downtown property . <p> Metro 's local sales tax will support paving the left-hand lanes , and the city of Houston will pay for utility work beneath the streets . <p> In all , $ 215.5 million worth of improvements are going into downtown and midtown Houston . The FTA is paying 32 percent , Metro is paying 50 percent , the city of Houston is paying 16 percent and the Downtown District is paying 2 percent . <p> Approximately 34 miles of streets will be rebuilt , along with the storm drainage beneath much of them . <p> Here is the basic concept : <p> Metro buses destroy city streets . Downtown is not only a destination for many buses ( one-third of downtown workers ride Metro ) , but a major transfer point for nondowntown riders . <p> In Metro 's $ 1 billion " Regional Bus Plan , " which replaced the rail plan killed in 1992 , it made sense to make downtown more bus and pedestrian friendly . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus shelters and kiosks and still leave room for walking . And studies show downtown 's one-way streets have excess traffic capacity . Therefore , some streets can lose a lane so the sidewalks can be wider . <p> In the process of rebuilding , the whole streetscape may as well look inviting to help revitalize downtown . It will have landscaping , better lighting , new traffic signals , newspaper vending racks and sidewalk seating . <p> More than 70 intersections will have brick-style crosswalks . Many sidewalks will have the same material . <p> In a somewhat novel design , storm water wo n't drain by the curb , which makes for a wet leap to get on a bus . Instead , the street will slant in slightly to a trench drain in the middle of the street . <p> Pedestrians also will get splashed less by passing buses , Metro officials said . <p> Other than the FTA funding issue , several issues have cropped up : <p> An April 1996 federal court ban against Metro 's affirmative action program stalled the street program for nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to any transit authority that did n't have affirmative action , even if it was due to a court order . It did not relent until severely pressured . <p> In the absence of affirmative action , which set minority subcontracting goals on all winning bidders , Metro 's minority board members have been concerned that enough of the work goes to minority firms . So , last year , Metro divided the planned 25 downtown construction contracts into 57 contracts , each of which will be bid separately . <p> This was done so that smaller minority firms could have a chance to win smaller pieces - some as small as $ 500,000 - since they generally do n't have the bonding ( insurance ) capacity to bid for larger contracts . <p> Additionally , all 57 winning bidders will be expected to subcontract 35 percent of their work to a Metro-approved , color-blind list of small businesses . <p> Even with those steps , new board member Ira Scott last month said he wanted a postponement in the award of contracts . He wondered why " 57 contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look into the matter . <p> While Metro staff says multiple contracts might increase administrative costs and traffic woes , that could be the least of Metro 's problems . <p> The two-year court delay has put Metro 's project squarely in the middle of Houston 's latest building boom , and alarmingly few companies are bothering to bid on the Metro jobs , said Metro assistant general manager Dan Penaloza . <p> Metro had to rebid its first downtown contract recently when only one company made an offer and it was much higher than anticipated . So far , the average has been three bidders per job , rather than the six typical for a street job two years ago . <p> Prices are running 5 percent to 10 percent higher than Metro estimated , Penaloza said . If the trend continues , the project may have to be scaled back , he said . <p> Paving contractor Charles Beyer , past president of the Houston Contractors Association , said the building boom was playing into several other factors that Metro should have anticipated . <p> Downtown street work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of old railroad tracks , abandoned gas lines and other surprises can be waiting beneath the road surface . <p> Also , he said , plenty of attorneys work downtown and will be walking through the construction zones where they might trip and sue . That 's how contractors think , he said . <p> With other work available in the suburbs , " we all like to do the easy job before the hard job , " Beyer said . <p> Beyer 's group successfully sued Metro over its 21 percent affirmative action program . So now , in response , Metro has forced upon contractors the much larger 35 percent " race neutral " small business set-aside . <p> That 's a big chunk of a job to give away , Beyer said , leading to a " why bother " attitude when other work is available , he said . <p> Overlapping with Metro 's plans is a new concept pushed by some private backers called Cotswold . It would create more parking on many streets on the north side of downtown , near the new baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and security , sparking a retail and streetscape renaissance in the area . <p> Parts of the Cotswold concept directly interfere with Metro 's long-standing plans , to which Metro is obligated by contract with the FTA . These include head-in parking on the same space Metro wants to operate buses . <p> As the months go by , not much has been heard from the owner of the downtown streets - City Hall . Presumably , the city might wish to suggest a compromise or other action before Metro gets too much further into its project . <p> The centerpiece of Metro 's plan is turning Main Street into a grand avenue , through both downtown and midtown . As such , it originally was one of the first streets in the schedule of work . <p> Now it has been postponed to several years later in the project , since Metro is studying a light rail line down Main Street to the Astrodome area . <p> It would n't make sense to construct Main Street and then tear it up if plans change , Penaloza said . The extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost about $ 12 million , he said , but Metro can not spend the money yet because it would " prejudice " a federal cost-effectiveness study of rail in the corridor . <p> Property owners want Main Street improved as soon as possible , Eury said . They want it so bad , he said , that they are studying a special taxing district to raise part of the $ 12 million themselves . <p> Metro will be labeling all of its work with large signs that say , " Downtown Turnaround . " The groundbreaking ceremony will be at 11 a.m . Monday in a parking lot at 1200 San Jacinto . <p> Contracts that have been awarded in April and May , with some work to start this week , are the following : <p> MEB Engineering will construct San Jacinto from Walker to Leeland for $ 5.6 million - 12 percent higher than Metro had estimated . <p> Jerdon Enterprise will construct St. Joseph Parkway ( formerly Calhoun ) from Jackson to San Jacinto for $ 3.8 million . It will continue from San Jacinto to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in two to help small bidders , but Jerdon won them both for 9 percent and 11 percent more than Metro anticipated . <p> Texas Sterling Construction will build Louisiana from West Gray to Spur 527 for $ 7.4 million - actually 10 percent lower than Metro expected . <p> Metro promises never to work on adjacent streets and generally to keep half of each street open as it is under construction . <p> Officials say they 've tried hard to make sure every utility that wants to work beneath the streets will have done so before final paving . Taxpayers are especially incensed when a freshly paved road gets torn up for new fiber optic cables , sewers or whatever , Penaloza said . <p> Penaloza said he will even try to see if the city will agree to a digging ban for a set time after the new streets are done . <p> Meanwhile , let the dirt fly , officials said . Metro 's Web site - **26;770;TOOLONG - will contain updates . <p> " It 's not going to be pleasant . There 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , " Penaloza said . <p> " The final product will be worth it . " <p> <p> <p>
