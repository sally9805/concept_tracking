Even though the Pitiful Dallas Mavericks are one of the richest sources of comedy material in town , rivaled only by the Dallas Cowboys ' Leon Lett , stand-up comics at The Comedy House tend to steer clear of Maverick jokes , mainly because they never know when one of the club 's proprietors , 6 ' 8 " , 240-pound Mav forward Randy White , might be in the audience . But elsewhere in Dallas , everyone is a comedian when the conversation turns to the Mavs. // How are the Mavericks like a man with four twenty-dollar bills ? Neither one of them can break a hundred . // But the Mavs themselves are a humorless bunch these days , and not just because three home court losses last week extended their losing streak to 15 games and left them with a sorry 1-18 record . Losing , the Mavericks can handle . After all , they were 11-71 in 1992-93 , dangerously close to the NBA standard for ineptitude , the 9-73 mark of the ' 72-73 Philadelphia 76ers . No , the main reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the relationship between their first-year coach , Quinn Buckner , and the players has been even uglier than their record . // Before the season was even a month old , the Mavs were rebelling against what one player called Buckner 's " reign of terror . " The three most important Mavericks  --  rookie forward Jamal Mashburn and guards Jimmy Jackson , who is in his second season , and 11-year veteran Derek Harper  --  were the most demonstrative in their criticism , lashing out publicly at Buckner for everything from his erratic substitution patterns and his structured half-court offense to what they considered his harsh treatment of the players . Harper , the ultimate good soldier during a career spent entirely with the Mavs , went so far as to openly express his anger at Buckner during a game on Nov. 16 . When a visitor to the Dallas locker room last week innocently asked Harper , " How 's life ? " some of his frustration came tumbling out . " Life is O.K. ; it 's my job that stinks right now , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never thought I 'd enjoy a year less than I did last year , but this has been so much worse . " // A much-needed team meeting in early December brought about a slight thaw in relations between Buckner and his team , although the Mavericks ' locker room is still about as warm and cheery as a prison cell . The players ' feelings about Buckner have n't changed , but they are at least making an effort to keep their displeasure to themselves . Mashburn , known for his quick first step , used it to dash right out of Reunion Arena last week before reporters could reach him after a 106-101 loss to the Miami Heat , and Harper could muster only a halfhearted attempt to put a positive spin on the state of his relationship with Buckner . " We 're not getting engaged , " he said . " We do n't have to love each other to do our jobs . " Some vote of confidence . // Have you heard about the remake of the movie Twelve Angry Men ? It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Buckner and his players is especially surprising because as a young former NBA player  --  still only 39 , he was a key member of the Boston Celtics ' ' 84 championship team  --  Buckner 's greatest attribute was expected to be his ability to command the respect and affection of the troops . Instead , he has seemed more intent on being the Mighty Quinn , running the team with an iron hand reminiscent of his college coach , Indiana 's Bob Knight . Although Buckner says he has n't so much as spoken with Knight recently , he has shown the same disturbing need for total control . " Make one mistake , " says Mashburn , " and be ready to grab some bench . " In a 124-91 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Dec. 1 , Buckner called a timeout 24 seconds into the game . // " I ca n't be Coach Knight in any way , shape or form , and I 'm not trying to be , " says Buckner . " I can only be me . All I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm concerned with my players ' state of mind , but I 'm not going to let some complaining or criticism sway me from doing what I think needs to be done . Over time , the players will see that I 'm not inflexible . I 'm willing to listen and willing to learn . " // After he was hired last March , Buckner brought in veteran player-personnel guru Stu Inman , an architect of the Portland Trail Blazers ' success in the 1970s , as a consultant . That move was n't exactly a compliment to the Mavs ' incumbent brain trust of Norm Sonju , the chief operating officer and general manager , and Rick Sund , the vice-president of basketball operations . Soon , owner Donald Carter  --  known to be loyal to his employees , perhaps to a fault  --  might finally decide he is paying an awfully large contingent for such meager results . // But the players ' unhappiness is the most pressing issue . Even the always optimistic Sonju admits , " It concerned us that the players felt they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to go to the media . " After a game against the Utah Jazz on Nov. 13 , Jackson angrily yelled at Buckner about substitution patterns , and when Mashburn was yanked early in the first quarter from a game against the Trail Blazers on Nov. 21 , he fumed . " I asked him why I was coming out , " Mashburn says , " and he did n't say much . If he 's trying to send me a message , he 's got to tell me . Let me in on it too . " There was a Dale Carnegie seminar last week in the lobby of the hotel in which Mashburn lives , and young Mash  --  who , despite his difficulties , leads the Mavs in scoring with 19.5 points per game  --  would have undoubtedly been happy to invite his new coach over for a few tips on winning friends and influencing people . // Mashburn also has doubts about Buckner 's X 's and O 's , particularly the Mavs ' triangle offense , which , like Knight 's scheme at Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 6 ' 8 " Mashburn feels the structure inhibits his talents , particularly his ability to slash through almost any defense . " We 've got to be aggressive , " he says . " We ca n't be like robots . " // Given Mashburn 's state of mind , the arrival of his college coach , Kentucky 's Rick Pitino , in Dallas last week made for a bit of intrigue , but Pitino quickly quashed any thoughts that he was brought in to try to facilitate a Mashburn-Buckner d ? tente or perhaps even to discuss replacing Buckner himself . " The timing is just coincidental , " he said after watching his former All-America score just two points in a 125-93 thrashing by the Seattle SuperSonics on Thursday . " I planned this trip to visit Jamal two months ago . " // Buckner attributes some of the differences he has had with Mashburn and Jackson to their youth . " Sometimes when everything has been handed to you before you 've even played , it comes as a shock to learn you have to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since leaving Kentucky , Mashburn has gotten used to the sort of star treatment that comes with being the fourth pick of the draft and the recipient of a reported seven-year , $32 million contract . The kind of dilemma Mashburn deals with these days is whether or not to trade in the red Ferrari , received as part of his $5 million Fila shoe deal , for a red Mercedes because he ca n't drive a stick . // But the tension between Buckner and the veteran Harper ca n't be explained away as easily . It began during the preseason when Buckner handed Harper 's starting spot to Fat Lever . While Lever has played in only 35 games during the last three seasons because of various knee ailments , Harper has been the Mavs ' cornerstone , starting all but 57 of the team 's 594 games since midway through the ' 85-86 season ( he missed 51 of those with injuries ) . Taking a starting job from Harper , the Mav captain and one of the most popular players in franchise history , was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harper started the season opener , but hostilities resumed when Buckner yanked him against the New York Knicks on Nov. 16 only 3:47 into the contest . During a timeout moments later , a steaming Harper sat in open defiance of Buckner at the end of the bench while the rest of the team huddled around the coach . When Buckner reinserted him three minutes later , Harper cursed audibly as he passed the scorer 's table and kicked a resin bottle onto the floor . " There 's too many games being played with me , man , " Harper said later . // Buckner handled that flare-up the way he has handled all the incidents  --  with a tight-lipped air of superiority . His pet answer to most inquiries about the turmoil on his team is that he does n't discuss " internal matters , " of which the Mavs seem to have more than the CIA . // How many Mavs does it take to screw in a light bulb ? No one knows . Buckner says it 's an internal matter . // But now Buckner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the controversies have been humbling , and for someone who has been accused of thinking he knows it all , he has actively sought advice from outside the organization . " Sometimes the players may misconstrue the toughness I show as a lack of openness , " he says . " I care about these guys , and I 'm confident they 'll see that . " // It appears that Buckner will have the opportunity to reverse his bad start . Carter made it a point to drop by the locker room after the Miami loss to declare his " 100 percent support " for his rookie coach . But Buckner will have to show that the softening he has shown recently is n't just temporary . He also would be wise to push for a trade of Harper , for several reasons . The franchise owes it to Harper not to make him suffer through another horrible season . But more than that , Buckner has already made a miscalculation by not realizing that the highly respected Harper could have been his greatest ally in dealing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to keep Harper around as a constant reminder of that blunder and of the bad first impression he made with the players . // As woeful as things have been for the Mavericks , all of Dallas remembers that Cowboy coach Jimmy Johnson was 1-15 and the object of similar scorn in his first year in town but won the Super Bowl three years later . No one is counting on such a quick and dramatic reversal from Buckner and the Mavs . At week 's end it seemed enough of a challenge simply for Buckner to keep from coming true one joke currently making the rounds . // What do Quinn Buckner and Jimmy Johnson have in common ? They both won only one game their first year .
