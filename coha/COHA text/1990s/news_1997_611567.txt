<p> When Gloria Chan first told her parents she was going to study journalism , there were angry shouts , tears and dire warnings . Her father told how her grandfather had died at the hands of China 's Communists , although he never explained the events . Finally , they disavowed her choice , saying : " If anything happens , do n't blame us ! " <p> But Chan was stubborn . " They said it 's dangerous , " she said . " But it 's my interest , so I did n't listen to them . " She graduated in May from the Chinese University here , and landed a temporary reporter 's job at Apple Daily , Hong Kong 's colorful and vibrant newspaper known for its in-your-face attitude and independent editorial voice . <p> Chan , 21 , now works on the most sensitive of all the beats , assigned to the political desk and reporting on the activities of the local Democratic Party . <p> She admits she is worried  --  not about family pressures , but possible pressure from China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 1 and where an authoritarian Communist Party government takes a dim view of Hong Kong 's Western-style brand of press freedom . <p> " I get worried , but I do n't want myself to think that I 'm worried , " she said . " Maybe I 'm lying to myself . If I 'm worried , then what I 'm doing is meaningless . If I 'm optimistic , then I can force myself to work more energetically . <p> " Some of my friends think I 'm crazy being a journalist , " she added . " Just like my parents . They think maybe I can be a journalist , but not now . They think this is the most dangerous time . " <p> With the Hong Kong handover less than a week away , many journalists and others are worried that the territory 's vaunted press freedom may become the first casualty as China 's jittery leadership attempts to assert its control . <p> Hong Kong 's media have traditionally been among the freest and most lively in Asia . Past British colonial governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media outlets , but these were virtually never used . <p> Many journalists , like Chan , say they too are wondering whether they one day will be faced with the question of whether staying in the profession is worth the risk . <p> Some already may have quit . Firm numbers are difficult to find , but Carol Lai , a freelance writer who chairs the Hong Kong Journalists Association , said , " Many have left their jobs without telling us the real reason . " <p> Others are perhaps being eased out . Lai said some Chinese-language newspapers apparently have decided to clear out anti-China columnists , but always under the guise of a general newspaper redesign or an overall staff reduction . <p> " Around 100 days prior to the handover , many newspapers began to clean up their op-ed pages , " Lai said . " Many outspoken China critics had their columns spiked . They would just say they were going to reallocate the space . " <p> In such an atmosphere , some feel there is no real security in the job or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when the topic may be considered sensitive or off-limits by Hong Kong 's next rulers . " Sooner or later , I may have difficulty finding a job , " said Liu Kin-ming of the Hong Kong Economic Times . " If it comes to a point where I can no longer do my job , I 'll switch to another profession . I 'll find another battlefield . " <p> Some newcomers to journalism say they are sticking strictly to what might be considered " nonsensitive " areas  --  like feature writing or business news  --  to avoid possible conflicts with China . <p> Catherine Cheung , 22 , another May journalism graduate , now works as a financial reporter for the local television station Wharf Cable . " The problem of political censorship is not very serious because of the nature of the news , " she said . <p> Her mother had been worried about her work as 1997 approached , Cheung said , but " now she knows I work on the business desk . She 's not worried now . " <p> But other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that Chinese sensitivities extend to many areas beyond politics . Four years ago , for example , Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang was arrested in China and sentenced to 12 years in prison for disclosing " state secrets " in his newspaper , Ming Pao Daily News . The " secrets " consisted of changes in China 's interest rates and gold sales . He was released from prison this year . <p> The Basic Law , the document covering all aspects of Hong Kong life under the coming Chinese rule , explicitly protects the territory 's news media . Article 27 states : " Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech , of the press and of publication . " <p> But there is another provision , Article 23 , that journalists , lawyers and pro-democracy politicians find more ominous . It deals with national security , and states that the incoming government " shall enact on its own laws to prohibit any act of treason , secession , sedition , subversion against the Central People 's Government , or theft of state secrets , " among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government officials have tried to reassure local journalists that press freedom will be maintained , their statements often have been mixed with veiled threats and hints of restrictions to come . <p> For example , Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last year in an interview that reporters " can put forward criticism , but not rumors or lies or personal attacks on the Chinese leaders . " <p> Tung Chee-hwa , the conservative shipping tycoon chosen to run Hong Kong for China , has said he favors making it a crime to advocate independence for Taiwan or Tibet . <p> " What if you or I write an article criticizing Chinese Premier Li Peng 's economic policies ? Is that a personal attack ? " asked Liu of the Economic Times . <p> The Chinese government is not always subtle in dealing with what it considers an unfriendly press . When Jimmy Lai , the flamboyant owner of Apple Daily , wrote a column calling Li Peng a " son of a turtle 's egg with zero IQ , " he soon found his Giordano clothing store outlet shut down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was allowed to reopen . <p> Media analysts and journalists say the financial pressures on media owners  --  many of whom have huge and diversified interests in China  --  provide far more effective tools of censorship than targeting individual reporters . " If a media organization would like to develop its business in China , it might more readily compromise its editorial stand here , " said Daisy Li , a journalist with Ming Pao and a former chair of the journalists association . <p> One of the biggest concerns here among journalists , pro-democracy politicians and others is that the media already may be censoring themselves , with reporters and editors anticipating what Beijing 's leaders want to hear , and taming or tailoring their coverage to fit . The Chinese-language press here is accused of having lost its teeth and its nerve when it comes to running stories that China 's leaders might deem critical . <p> But if self-censorship is a problem , there is widespread disagreement about who is to blame . <p> Some pro-China politicians blame the reporters . Allen Lee , chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Chinese-appointed replacement , told a press conference , " I do n't see any indication from C.H. Tung 's office or from Chinese officials that they want to curb press freedom . " <p> Turning to the local Hong Kong reporters in the room , Lee said , " If you want to engage in self-censorship , that 's your problem . That 's unacceptable to me . And if you do it yourself , that 's your problem . We 're not going to make laws on that . " <p> But reporters say the problem starts higher up , with editors setting the tone in newsrooms for the types of stories they want , and owners giving the overall direction . <p> Many reporters agreed , however , that they have the primary responsibility for standing up for free expression in Hong Kong , even if that means personal sacrifice . <p> " I 'm not totally pessimistic , " said Carol Lai of the journalists ' association . " We know we 'll have lots of local laws made by the provisional legislature that will affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fight for our rights . Nobody can do it for us . As long as we are prepared for the challenges ahead , I think we 'll push through it . "
