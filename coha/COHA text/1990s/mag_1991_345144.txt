Until last week Dallas had the increasingly rare distinction of being a two- newspaper town . The rivalry between the Morning News ( daily circ. 406,800 ) and the Times Herald ( 200,700 ) was a spirited one . But the old-fashioned newspaper war finally had a casualty . The 112-year-old Times Herald said last week it would cease publication and sell its assets for $55 million to A.H . Belo , the parent company of the Morning News . The Times Herald publisher , John Buzzetta , said he decided to shut down the paper after approaching more than 100 potential investors during the past year and finding no takers . The rival papers were equivalent in size as recently as the 1970s , but the weak Texas economy of the ' 80s eroded the strength of the afternoon paper .
