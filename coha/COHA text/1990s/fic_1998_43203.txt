Bill 's mother had worried a lot at housecleaning time about where to put the spare folding couch-until Bill heard about it . <p> " Out in the shed , where we have our clubroom , " he decided promptly . <p> " But you have a cot there already , " she said , laughing . " And even you ca n't sit but one place at a time . " <p> *Well , it would be handy when the boys come in . <p> This rainy October night the boys were in , and the spare couch groaned now and then under its capacity load . Bill shared a place on the cot with Slim , since he did n't take up much room , but Nick and Tim , Andy and Cupe sprawled dejectedly against the cushions opposite . <p> " No , " Nick sighed . " Without any coach or any money backing , and with a new principal who makes you do funny things like get up before the whole assembly to apologize for your wrong-doings and who 's probably never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team . " <p> " While there 's life , there 's hope , " Slim quoted cheerfully . " And we six have life enough . " " We have , but the Boosters ' Club of Junior High has been absolutely dead for two years . One seasons defeat and they just evaporated . " <p> " Cock-a-doodle-doo ! " came a defiant crowing , and a small bantam rooster stuck his head out from under Bill 's cot . <p> " He thought you said rooster , ' " Bill apologized . " Get back under there , Brutus ! Yes , sir ! Right in your box . Now stay there and keep still or Mother 'll have you in a chicken pie tomorrow noon . <p> " Chicken pie ! That in a chicken pie ? " Cupe jeered . " Why , he has n't enough meat on him for a-a swallow . " <p> " Not as much as you , Cupe , " Bill admitted , " but some ways he 's better'n you . For instance , this rooster 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow just in time . <p> " Cock-a-doodle-doo ! " came again , muffled by the couch cover . <p> " See ? He knows every time I say rooster . ' He has more intelligence than- " " Oh , yes , yes , " Tim put in impatiently . " Of course , Brutus has intelligence , but that is n't what we have to decide about tonight . Are we or are we not going to get together a football team ? " <p> " Are ! " came several voices emphatically . " But how can we finance it ? " Andy asked practically . " The old Boosters ' Club used to have dues , so they could furnish uniforms and get tickets printed and things . " <p> " We 'll just start a new Boosters ' Club ourselves , " said Slim . He had been thoughtfully plucking at the corner of the lumpy cushion , where a sharp feather-quill had recently surprised him . With a final tug , he extracted the offender and began blowing at it . It was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . <p> " We can be the nucleus- " <p> " The which ? " asked Andy . <p> " The er-center of a club whose object shall be to encourage Junior High athletics , especially football . As the new Boosters- " <p> At this explosive word , the feather soared high and away to the other side of the room , where it continued to be upheld by the puffs of the four boys there reclining . This same word was also too much for Brutus . He stuck his head out once more and flapped his wings preparatory to his challenging crow . <p> " He 's just wondering again whether you were speaking to him or not , " Bill explained , muzzling the club mascot . Brutus meekly flicked his lower eyelids over beady eyes and made funny noises in his throat before forcibly retiring . <p> " He gives me an idea , " Slim said thoughtfully , following the feather with his eye . " Why ca n't Brutus be our football mascot ? He rhymes so nicely . The rooster is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sing-songed Tim . <p> " He crows just like he useter , " Andy suggested brightly . <p> But Slim held up his hand in horror . " I do n't like that ' useter . ' What more do you want ? Here , let me finish it : <p> The rooster is a booster . <p> He crows at early morn . <p> He crows just as he useter <p> In the days ere we were born ! <p> " Is n't that ' ere ' in the last line poetic enough to make up for the ' useter ' ? " asked Bill . <p> Slim muttered it over to himself and decided that it was . " Really that sounds pretty good . We 'd better have a second verse , too . " <p> " Oh , we 're the roosting boosters ? " suggested Cupe timidly . He was n't much on poetry . <p> " Wrong ! If we 're roosting all the time we ca n't boost much , " interjected Slim . <p> " Oh , we 're the rooster boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cupe . <p> " We crow from morn till night , " was Tim 's next offering . <p> The next two lines came slowly but the boys were well-satisfied when they were done . Bill had to rouse himself to a semi-reclining position and direct Andy 's search over his old desk for pencil and paper to write it down with . Then they repeated it in unison , twice , three times , and with much gusto : <p> " The rooster is a booster . <p> He crows at early morn . <p> He crows just as he useter <p> In the days ere we were born . <p> Oh , we 're the Rooster-Boosters , <p> We crow from morn till night ! <p> You just watch us Roosters <p> Boost everything in sight ! " <p> " It just sings itself . " Slim cried delightedly . " Ca n't you see them and hear them as we come loping into the field in our spanking new uniforms ? The bleachers will start chanting . The rooster is a booster , ' and somebody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll win the game , sure as anything . " <p> " But I 'm not so sure about the uniforms , " Tim said skeptically . " I do n't believe I can scare up so much as a spiked shoe , myself If there 's only us six in the club- " <p> " Six ? Huh ! There 'll be nearer six hundred , " Bill said largely . " I 've an idea for getting members ! " He sat bolt upright , just in time for the muchharassed feather to land directly in the curve that lay between his nose and his upper lip . <p> " Achoo ! " The feather took to the air again under the force of a huge sneeze , and everybody doubled in merriment . <p> " There , then ! " Andy came over and patted his shoulder consolingly . " Got the dust all off your brains ? Now tell us the idea . " <p> " I will not , " Bill replied . " It may not work , anyhow . " He snatched at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plume-upward , in his lapel . " You 'll see tomorrow <p> " Is it decided then ? How many are going out for football ? " Andy asked . Slim , flushing , raised his hand with the rest . " I guess I 'm not heavy enough , but- " <p> " But you 're quick as a cat , " Andy said generously . <p> " And you 'll have lots of time to eat between now and then . I 'll show you how , " was Cupe 's promise . <p> The next day , Bill arrived at the school grounds early . Under his coat was a slight bulge . Conspicuous in his lapel was the red feather from the evening before . He walked with a strut and muttered half-aloud a little doggerel verse . Almost at once he was accosted by Big Red Evans . <p> " Hmm ! I see your friend Brutus is shedding something . " <p> " Oh , that little feather ? Had n't you heard ? That 's the insignia of the new Rooster-Boosters Club . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged . " Gee ! I wish I had one . " <p> " Maybe I could get you one , but they cost a quarter . I was going to say , " Bill went on quickly , " it 's a nickel more for honorary membership . " <p> " That 's the kind I want . " <p> " Do you promise to uphold athletics ? " Red nodded , so Bill disappeared around a corner , plucked a feather from under his coat , and returned to fasten the insignia ceremoniously to the lapel of the new Rooster-Booster . <p> Red went his way and Bill began stalking back and forth once more . Soon Nick and Andy came tearing up . " Say , where do we get in on this ? Red Evans is sporting around with a feather , saying he 's a Rooster-Booster . " <p> " Is he ? " <p> " He is . When do we get ours ? " " They cost a quarter , " Bill remarked . Nick 's face fell , and Andy 's was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four lone pennies . <p> Aw , Bill- " <p> " I was going to say , " Bill went on , " that you , being charter members present at the organization meeting , need n't pay for your insignia-only do n't tell anybody . " <p> " Where is it , quick ? " Nick urged . " I have to report early for whispering yesterday . " Bill 's hand fumbled under his coat and emerged with two long reddish feathers . <p> Andy was a little horrified . " Say , do n't let Slim see you doing that . " <p> Bill just grinned and patted the bulge . <p> Word spread swiftly that the Boosters ' Club had been revived , and Bill was surrounded with eager , questioning schoolmates . Some had money on their persons , so they were able to pay for membership for themselves and whichever of their friends pleaded hardest . Others asked Bill to trust them , and were informed that he could carry no charge accounts , but if they brought back money when they went home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few stood at one side , jeering the project . <p> " When we get home , we 'll go out in the chickenyard and pluck tail feathers off our rooster and then we 'll belong to the Boosters . " <p> Bill stopped and eyed the speaker scornfully . " I guess you 're just the kind of a guy the last Boosters ' Club had in it . Maybe you , too , will fade away , just like the last club did . " <p> " Hear , hear ! " cried the boys , who ran off the offender . <p> " Here come the girls , " announced a bystander . <p> " Going to form a BiddiesBoosters , Sally ? " <p> Sally was not . " I 'm not the henny , " she answered witheringly . " Can we join the Roosters , Bill ? We have n't much money , but we 'll give you a bake-sale tomorrow . Wo n't we , girls ? Total proceeds . " <p> The girls agreed . " Every week , every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us each one of those adorable rooster feathers this minute . " <p> The matter needed pondering , but Bill was blushing under the unaccustomed feminine attention , and besides the warning bell was due . He began quickly doling feathers from the seemingly unlimited supply under his coat . <p> Rrrr-ing ! came the warning bell , and the pupils of Junior High scattered their several ways like ants beneath a suddenly overturned stone . Only Bill remained . He remained because Slim was confronting him , fire in his eye , knots working in his lean fists . " I 'm no fighter , Bill , but I ca n't stand any more <p> of this . I 'd have lit into-I 'd have lit- " " You 'd have alighted on me ? " Bill suggested helpfully . <p> " Well , anyway , I would have , sooner'n this , except I couldn't't believe my eyes . It 's been fine , your keeping Brutus when he 's really the mascot of the whole gang . Have n't any of us minded . But I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom at a loss for words , but this time his tongue got ahead of his thought . <p> " Demoralized ? " asked Bill solemnly . <p> " De-feathered , " finished Slim , fiercely . " Give him to me ! " <p> Bill was enjoying himself He laughed and threw one strong arm across Slim 's shoulder and , carefully guarding the bulge under his own coat , guided him through the great door into the main corridor . No one was in sight . It was almost time for the tardy bell . <p> Slim had never been tardy in his life . He gulped once or twice . They were passing the open door of the principal 's office when he stopped short and made a swift dive for Bill 's bulge . <p> Bill warded him off . The skirmish led them over the threshold into the office . Miss Slater , the secretary , had just finished the morning dusting and turned on the electric fan . She quickly looked up and uttered a horrified " Boys ! " <p> The boys did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet had feathers . Bill was intent on prolonging Slim 's unfounded distress . <p> The tardy bell rang . Slim made one last frantic effort , pulled aside Bill 's coat , and ripped completely open ... not Brutus ... but the old cushion from which Bill had drawn , one by one , the feather insignia of the new Boosters . <p> Miss Slater screamed and jumped onto a chair at the sight of what followed . The janitor , seeing the dun-colored cloud pouring into the corridor and thinking it was smoke , turned in a fire alarm and ran for an extinguisher . Before he arrived , things were in a pretty bad way in the office . Feathers cockily adorned the portraits of each of the new principal 's predecessors . The bust of Caesar carried a feather collar . Dusty feathers fluttered hither and yon , settled a moment , then bounced on again . <p> After the janitor arrived , things were n't much better . The fire extinguisher chemicals did n't smell good and the feathers continued to dance and the janitor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boys could hear the tramp of orderly feet going down the stairs , and out the side exits . From the corner of his eye , Slim could see the boys and girls lining up outside , waiting orders either to march down the hill or return to the school . To them it was just another fire drill , and they probably were wondering if they 'd cleared the building in the required three minutes . To him , it was unutterable disgrace , and he did n't believe they 'd ever clear the building . Feathers , feathers <p> Simultaneously he and Bill and Miss Slater and the janitor sneezed . Slim discovered he felt a draft . They all felt one , in fact , even the feathers . He tiptoed over to Miss Slater 's desk and gently turned off the electric fan . Things became quieter . The feathers settled daintily here and there . The janitor breathed a sigh of relief . Miss Slater began powdering her nose . <p> " Well , well ! " The principal 's voice boomed from the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Bill stooped and began rapidly cramming moist feathers into the cushion . " Just a few-feathers , sir . " <p> " The insignia of the new Boosters ' Club , you see , " Slim explained with shaking voice , as he , too , knelt to gather feathers . <p> " I ... see . " Even if they had been looking , the boys could n't have told whether it was a frown or a grin that passed over Mr. Harris ' face , so quickly did he mask it . " There are feathers clear to the second floor , not to mention those the students are wearing . I suppose you know the penalty for such an ... offense ? " <p> The boys nodded mutely , avoiding each other 's eyes . Slim wished he could turn into an angleworm and crawl into a hole in the ground . Bill wished he had all the feathers in the world and could fly to some far haven where schools had never been invented . <p> " Very well , " the principal said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , down the corridor to their respective rooms . Slim had never known the world to be so dark . The hands of the clock trudged slowly , then leaped swiftly toward the hour for the penalty . Oh , he could never stand before the whole school ! Then suddenly an idea came to him . He really wanted a football team , did n't he , even if the board of education could n't afford a coach ? Well , here was his chance to advertise the Rooster-Boosters . Could he do it ? He must ! <p> At the appointed hour , the Junior High School met for assembly . Slim and Bill were seated like prisoners at the bar on a sort of mourners ' bench near the stage . Mr. Harris made a few announcements , then signaled to Bill that his moment had come . <p> Bill arose and walked to the center of the stage . He , too , had had an idea . His voice was clear and dignified . <p> " Mr. Harris and fellow schoolmates , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am sorry that this-er disturbance occurred in just the way it did , but I rejoice that it gives me an opportunity to express my appreciation of your support of the new school organization known as the Rooster-Boosters Club and to tell you that there are still a few feathers left , and when they are gone , there is yet Brutus remaining and he would , in a shortage of insignia , furnish feathers from his own-his own- " <p> " Self , " Slim whispered , and Bill smiled his thanks as he went on without pausing for breath . <p> " Brutus would be glad to furnish feathers from his own self and I can not urge upon you too strongly the importance of joining this organization and making of our Junior High one of the greatest , the grandest , the footballiest schools this side of the- " <p> " Appalachian Mountains , " Slim whispered . He had planned to say something like that himself <p> " Appalachian Mountains , yes , this side of the Rocky Mountains , this side of the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm for oratory , rapped for order from the assemblage and indicated to Bill that his speech was over . It was Slim 's turn . <p> Slim started his advance over the acres of stage and found himself at last in the center , with dozens of pairs of merry eyes upon him . He had been as amazed at Bill 's speech as Bill himself had been , but now he must carry on . <p> " Friends-and Mr. Harris . " Oh , that was a bad beginning ! " I mean Mr. Harris-and friends . Er-just all friends . " He smiled blandly upon the new principal , then upon the school . " I was complicated in the complication of the morning and I wish to extend my-er apologies and also add to what my accomplice has already said regarding your backing of the Rooster-Boosters Club . I hope you all join , who have not already joined . We want your money , your interest , and your prayers , that we may some day soon all chant together the chant of the chanticleer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He crows at early morn . <p> He crows just as he useter <p> In the days ere we were born . Oh , we 're the Rooster-Boosters . We crow from morn till night ! <p> You just watch us Roosters <p> Boost everything in sight ! " <p> " Would you like to learn it ? Mr. Harris , may we say it in unison ? " Slim asked . <p> But already , led by Big Red Evans , the school was on its feet and the vociferous chant had become a reality . " The rooster is a booster- " <p> After history class , Bill found Slim hiding in the cloakroom . <p> " You old scoundrel , you ! What 'd you skip out for ? You did n't hear a word that Mr. Harris said afterwards , did you ? " <p> " No . What 'd he say ? " Slim was scared . " What did he say ? " <p> " Why , he said he hoped the Boosters Club would have the wholehearted support of the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach our skill practice if enough boys tried out for the team . D' you know who he is ? He 's the Jim Harris . " <p> " Not the Jim Harris ? " <p> " The very same . Remember reading how he hurt his back a couple of years ago ? It 's better , but he did n't dare take a college coaching job for fear he 'd forget himself some fine day and run out into the line and get really smashed up . So now he 's ours . And- " <p> " We 're the Rooster-Boosters- " Shoulder to shoulder , the boys marched down the hall to join their feathered friends , to chant their song , and to engage in splendid talk of the football team-to-be . <p>
