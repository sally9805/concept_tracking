Built on magnificent simplicity , the company has grown so vast and complex that Sam Walton would barely recognize it . CEO David Glass sees a bright future in food retailing ; Wall Street has its doubts . // SITTING BEHIND his scuffed desk in the shabby little office that once belonged to Sam Walton , Wal-Mart CEO David Glass comes across as defensive and occasionally inscrutable . In the four years since Wal-Mart 's founder died of bone cancer , Glass has invested billions of borrowed dollars in businesses that have earned relatively low returns . Yes , Wal-Mart 's sales have more than doubled to nearly $100 billion-an unmatched feat in the annals of the FORTUNE 500but what 's the payback ? Declining profit margins , for one thing-and in case you did n't notice that trend , " the little deal in the fourth quarter " sounded an alarm . The little deal ? Glass is referring to Wal-Mart 's first earnings dropoff in the 100 quarters since Sam Walton peddled a piece of his wealth to the public in 1970 . This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounting to small-town America-yet WalMart today , No. 4 on the FORTUNE 500 , is diversified , unpredictable , and very difficult to manage . Its core business appears mature ; its chain of Sam 's Club stores is flagging ; and its future , says the CEO , lies in food retailing , a brutally competitive arena . Maybe David Glass is brilliant . What almost killed Sears and Kmart , after all , was their managements ' resistance to change . But Wal-Mart 's disciples are losing faith in the company . Investors have knocked down Wal-Mart 's market value by $7.7 billion since the day Sam died . Walton had built it from nothing to $59.3 billion . Even longtime fans of WalMart say the stores are n't run as well as they used to be . And key executives , particularly Sam 's favorites , are leaving . The big shocker came at the end of March when Bill Fields , Glass 's heir apparent , told his boss he was quitting to become CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment . Fields headed Wal-Mart 's main operations and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hometown boy born and bred in Bentonville , Arkansas , Fields was hired by Sam fresh out of the University of Arkansas 24 years ago , became a sort of surrogate son , and was generally considered to be Wal-Mart 's star manager in operations and merchandising . What would Sam say about the direction his company has taken ? Says Fields : " Sam would probably change his opinion from day to day . I 'm not sure I know what he 'd think of WalMart today . And if I knew , I probably would n't say . But it 's a great question , the best question I 've heard . " Helen Walton , Sam 's widow , does n't want to speculate either . " I have no idea , " she says-though surely she 's wondered . Helen , 76 , owns 38% of Wal-Mart stock , in a trust with her four children . Even at today 's prices , the shares are worth about $20 billion . Perhaps it does n't really matter what Sam would think . Times have changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good , buried behind the Wal-Mart home office . What matters right now is whether David Glass can bring back the magic . Can he get Wal-Mart 's stock going up again ? Glass bristles at the skeptics : " Wall Street does n't understand , " he says . " They have an unbelievably short-term approach . All they care about is what happens this quarter . " Glass adds , " Their view is not going to cause us to reposition the company from our long-term strategy . " Photograph DOES GLASS REFLECT SAM ? Glass , former CFO and a logistics geniusjust the person , perhaps , to oversee a major expansion . But he lacks the strange charisma of Mr. Sam , the great showmanmerchant . Photograph VOTING WITH THEIR FEET ? Bill Fields , once the heir apparent to Glass , in March became the latest in a string of top aides to leave . // Wal-Mart 's everyday low stock price , though , is a very big deal . The stock , after all , is the fuel that has made this company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Sam Walton is history 's most successful retailer . An extraordinary combination of cornpone preacher , showman , and merchant , Walton believed that every one of his employees should think like a partner . Before everyone else started doing it , he called his workers " associates " and gave them stock . By sharing data like per store profits and turnover , he encouraged each employee at Wal-Mart , from the cashiers to the controllers , to understand the fundamentals of the business . When David Glass explains to Wal-Mart 's 675,000 associates or any other investors that Wal-Mart is still a high-growth company , he is aided by neither his performance record nor his demeanor . Glass is a dry and dispassionate man , not unlike fellow small-town Midwesterner Bob Dole . He is stoic , and plainly uncharismatic . This CEO is 60 , but he looks older , with a craggy face , kinky gray hair , and eyebrows that peak in arches , making him appear stern . People like and respect Glass , but few find him inspirational . The chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a good choice for CEO when Sam Walton , at 69 , tapped him to take over in 1988 . Glass , along with Wal-Mart 's current vice chairman , Don Soderquist , had pestered Walton relentlessly in the Seventies to invest in advanced distribution and merchandise-tracking systems . Wal-Mart would need the technology , Glass argued , to handle enormous sales volumes as the stores spread beyond their traditional base in the South and Midwest . Turns out , Glass was a logistics genius . Wal-Mart 's incomparable systems are a secret of its success-the unadvertised contributor to the stock 's 46.8% average annual return during the decade before Sam 's death . While Sam Walton was a " just do it " type of leader-he recruited disciples and fans by demonstrating how well Wal-Mart serves its customers and its workers-Glass is a " just you wait " kind of boss . His message : Be patient , please . He plans to make Wal-Mart America 's largest grocer . How ? By saturating America with " supercenters , " emporiums that combine a supermarket and general-merchandise store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy his blessing . In the late 1980s , Wal-Mart built a few combination stores that it called " hypermarts , " but they 've proved too big , and they do n't work . They failed . Nevertheless , Wal-Mart tasted delicious opportunity in food retailing ; the U.S. grocery trade is three times bigger than the discount-store industry . When Wal-Mart takes one of its discount stores , with maybe $25 million in annual revenues , and tacks on a supermarket , sales more than double . Sam lived to see Wal-Mart open only a few supercenters . But right after he died , Glass cranked up the spending , and in four years has expanded to 260 stores . They bring in about $13 billion in annual revenues . Glass says he intends to add more than 100 supercenters each year . It 's a risky bet . First , selling food is a lower-profit business than peddling fishing gear , footwear , and other inedible fare . " Hey , we were in a low-margin business before food , " Glass counters . Second , competition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's markets of choice . Here , even little-guy grocers belong to networks and cooperatives that give them buying clout . Says Thomas Haggai , CEO of IGA supermarkets , a group of independent food marketers : " Wal-Mart has done a sort of Sherman 's march through Dixie . They 've come right through the heart of IGA . But I do n't feel they 're any tougher to compete with than Kroger and some other chains . " THIS IS A HIGH-PRICED food fight . Glass has lifted Wal-Mart 's long-term debt from $1.7 billion in 1992 to $8.5 billion , and he 's using that money mainly to build supercenters , construct high-tech food-distribution centers , and buy land for supercenter expansion . Mr. Glass builds his dream house : He has acquired thousands of acres , envisioning supercenters on the sites . " We 're laying the pipes to be successful in the food business , " he says . As he does this , he 's closing hundreds of conventional Wal-Marts : 330 are shuttered . A few simply did n't make money . But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its supercenters down the road . Wal-Mart leases about half of its abandoned stores . // Since Walton died on April 5 , 1992 , the company 's stock has lost its fizz . // At the 1990 shareholders meeting , Walton predicted that in the year 2000 , Wal-Mart would generate $96 billion in revenues in its discount stores alone . Not even close . Last year the discount stores generated $53.2 billion in sales . Remarkably , the number of conventional Wal-Mart discount stores is , as of this year , declining . Today the markets Wal-Mart is invading are in metro areas , mainly on the West Coast and in the Northeast . Costs tend to be high there . Limiting expansion , too , are neighborhood advocates who want to keep WalMart out . Did you hear about the scuffle over Wal-Mart 's plan to open a store in the back yard of America 's founding father ? Preservationists in Fredericksburg , Virginia , recently won round No. 1 . Says Al Norman , who publishes Sprawl-Busters Alert , a retail newsletter : " The combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage since Lisa Marie and Michael Jackson . " If Sam pulled an Elvis-you know , returned from the dead-he 'd be all shook up by these strange happenings . But Glass insists that Sam 's favorite business is n't " mature . " He says , " There absolutely is a place for the Wal-Mart discount store today , but we figure that if you need to make a store bigger , you might as well make it a supercenter . " He adds , " Our big growth opportunity is supercenters . " Even if Glass 's audacious strategy is correct , Wal-Mart has a serious problem . " They have one legitimate growth vehicle-supercenters-and two big , slow-growing businesses , " says NatWest Securities retail analyst Robert Buchanan . The traditional discount stores bring in more than half of Wal-Mart 's revenues and three-quarters of its profits , so investors should wish this segment were healthier . Another drag on WalMart 's stock is its second-biggest business , the $20-billion-a-year Sam 's Club division . Sam 's Club is Wal-Mart 's version of those no-frills depots that sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-business owners , pay $25 a year to buy at cut-rate prices . Sam himself had high hopes for the enterprise , but shortly after he died the growth of the entire club market decelerated . Glass says , " As an industry , all of us lost our way . We tried to do things to distinguish ourselves from each other . Fresh meat , fresh bakeries . We added costs and confused our members . " Rather than retrench , Glass gunned it and went for market share . In 1994 , Wal-Mart bought Pace Membership Warehouses-99 stores-from Kmart . Pace was a lousy business . Many of the outlets were in poor locations , and needed refurbishing desperately . " Pace was a losing proposition at the time , " Glass admits . " But it 's the tuition you pay to get the education you need to get where you want to be . " SO WHERE is Sam 's now ? " No man 's land , " says Kurt Barnard , a consultant who has studied Wal-Mart for 30 years . Barnard , who publishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wal-Mart but says , " The wholesaleclub category has matured , topped out . Wal-Mart is writhing and wriggling . " Sam 's Clubs " main rival is PriceCostco . This company is a better operator , with sales per store of around $76 million . Sam 's registers about $45 million in its stores , which tend to be roughly the same square footage . Is Glass still glad he is a member of this club industry ? " Absolutely , " says the boss . He says Wal-Mart will revive Sam 's by focusing on business customers and by cutting expenses , but some investors think he should cut his ties instead . Regarding a spinoff of Sam 's , Glass says , " it 's the people on Wall Street that that appeals to . I do n't believe the club business will be a negative going forward . " All this follows 34 years of almost incomprehensible growth ; and it raises the question : Is Wal-Mart becoming one of those Titanics of the FORTUNE 500 ? Part of the answer lies overseas . No major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart restaurateurs , has really cracked the international puzzle big time . The reason is that the keys to success at home-economies of scale , buying power , and reputation-are difficult to export . WalMart 's 277 stores outside the U.S. generate only 4% of corporate revenues . The international division has never earned a dime . It 's supposed to this year . Against the tide , Glass has steered Wal-Mart into Canada , Mexico , Brazil , Argentina , and a few places in Asia . " It sounds like we 're going a little of everywhere , " says Glass . " We are . " It 's been rough sailing . Wal-Mart had a joint venture with a Thai conglomerate to enter China , but that collapsed in March ; the company is looking for a new partner . Photograph HITTING THE WALL This shuttered store in Hearne , Texas , is one of 330 the company has closed , mostly to make way for " supercenters. " // DISCOUNTING HISTORY This proposal for a mock-colonial edifice near George Washington 's childhood home was rejected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one crucial matter . Some people also believe that the company 's sharp execution , which once cut scores of competitors to ribbons , is slipping . Could it be that Glass 's passion-his cool fever-to reinvent the corporation is making Wal-Mart mediocre in many areas and a master in few ? Some say yes , Wal-Mart is losing focus . Listen to Michael Gade , who heads the retail practice at The Associates , a financial services firm in Dallas : " Wal-Mart has the critical mass and great technology to win , but things are happening at the store level that I have n't seen before . I see problems with out-of-stock merchandise . I 'm amazed to see greeters at the front door talking to other employees instead of to customers , and floors that are n't beautifully waxed and clean as they were just a year ago .

' I 'm a little scared , because I own a lot of shares of Wal-Mart . My kids own the stock too . " Says former Wal-Mart executive Thomas Jefferson , who lives in Arkansas and has a home in Southern California : " They 're going to bust their butts to keep the stores nicelooking around Bentonville , but when you go away from here , you see deteriorating Wal-Marts and sloppy housekeeping . " Jefferson , 77 , knew Sam Walton for more than 40 years , and just before he retired in 1985 , he served as executive vice president and Sam 's personal assistant . Jefferson shops the stores about twice a week . In his estimation , " Sam would raise hell . " Glass responds : " I see problems from time to time . Often you have customers who 'll come in , pick up a garment " - he raises his arm- " and drop it on the floor . " Who picks up the blouse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered just a few years ago , many associates are new and not yet " WalMartized . " Glass says , " If someone asked me , " How do you run a $100 billion corporation ? ' I 'd tell them , " I do n't have a clue . " We run this business a store at a time . If we do that , the bigness does n't affect you . " To monitor Wal-Mart 's spirit as well as the stores , the CEO and his top officers do as Sam required . They board WalMart 's prop planes in Bentonville each week and spend a few days wandering the outlets . Glass says he does n't find morale to be a problem . " Our associates are just more determined . They have the sense we 've got to do things better . " He concedes , though , " The longer this goes on that there 's no movement in the stock , the more it will worry our associates in our stores . " To move the stock , Glass is insisting that Wal-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-teens every year . " That means you have to layer on $15 billion in sales , " he says . " That 's the size of a pretty good retail company . " Photograph DAVID GLASS 'S DREAM HOUSE You could buy a fishing rod , a tackle box , and waders or change your mind and just buy a frozen fish . // At the same time , there 's the brain drain . Glass was caught off guard by Fields 's decision to quit Wal-Mart ; he says he tried to persuade him to stay . Not everyone liked Fields , who was tough and mercurial . But , says Wesley Wright , a 20-year company man who left last fall , " Nobody loved and understood Wal-Mart the way Bill Fields did . " The feeling around Bentonville is , if Fields , who was closest of all to Sam Walton , can quit , anyone can . He insists his departure-imagine , to go to work for another old codger , Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone-is no reflection on Wal-Mart 's prospects . " I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure does point to Wal-Mart 's problem in acquiring and keeping great talent . Fields earned $590,000 a year , according to Wal-Mart 's most recent proxy , to run a $68 billion business , and Wal-Mart does n't give the usual bonuses . At Blockbuster , which had revenues of about $3.3 billion , Fields is expected to earn lots more-how much , he wo n't say . Fields insists money was n't the issue . But for sure , Wal-Mart 's cheap stock price eased the pain of leaving options on the table in Bentonville . FIELDS 'S ARCHRIVAL , Sam 's Club President Dean Sanders , quit last fall , so Wal-Mart 's two most likely CEO candidates are gone . Thus , Wal-Mart 's future rests more than ever in the hands of David Glass . Retirement rumors have swirled , mainly because Glass , a baseball fanatic , is chairman of the Kansas City Royals . Many people have wondered just which game Glass prefers to play . A few months ago , when he registered with the SEC to sell some Wal-Mart stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanking , or ( b ) Glass is going to buy the team . None of the above , he says .

" A little adversity tends to crank up competitive people , and I 've always been competitive . " Behind that shabby wooden desk , inside Sam 's old office , the chief executive does indeed appear entrenched . As he ends his second interview for this article , he volunteers : " There 's a funny story about this desk . It was bought by Sam 's brother Bud Walton for $50 at a garage sale in Bentonville . " Glass was given the desk 20 years ago when he joined Wal-Mart . He continues , " Everybody else who had the desk before me got fired . I 've kept the desk . And I have n't been fired yet .
