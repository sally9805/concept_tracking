txt 400 Managing IS and Technology Investments projects had bypassed the normal justification process used in the organisation . Grindley ( 1991 ) summed up the mistrust of conventional justification methods in two insights from his survey : 1 83% of IT directors admit that the cost/benefit analyses supporting IT investment proposals are a fiction . 2 Quote from a CEO : " It 's like there is a spontaneous conspiracy to exaggerate the benefits " . Many others would agree , no doubt ! Many of the better papers on this subject are included in a book edited by Leslie Willcocks ( 1994 ) , entitled Information Management ? The Evaluation of Information Systems Investments . The approach described here forms one of the chapters of that book , but the authors recognise there is considerable merit in many of the other methods proposed . A " technology " investment can not strictly give a return on investment unless it replaces an older technology and carries out the same functions more efficiently . Most " technology " investments are justified on the back of applications . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of the need , the justification should be based on systems that will use that capacity and the benefits they will provide . However , it is often difficult to associate all " infrastructure " type investments with the subsequent benefits of using applications , even where sophisticated capital cost recovery accounting techniques are used . The arguments below will assume that reasonable cost allocations of shared resources can be arrived at ? reasonable in the sense that : 1 unused capacity is not " free " ? there is at least an opportunity cost of using it for another application , 2 each application need justify only the incremental capacity it requires , not the next capacity increment that has to be purchased , 3 where the technology is dedicated to an application the full cost is attributed to the application . Another point of evaluation logic which is peculiar perhaps to IS/IT investments is the way in which particular costs and benefits should be treated . Most accounting evaluation practices are conservative , expecting the worst and mistrusting the best . Raw IT costs have been reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is difficult for accounting procedures to accept when evaluating systems with 5- , 8- or 10-year lives . This changing reality of running costs of systems over time must be allowed for where shared resources are used . It is important to take a realistic ( even marginal ) view of the costs rather than a theoretical one . Equally frequently , the full costs of " development " are not included . Evaluating IS/IT Investments 401 Normally the IT department and procurement costs for hardware and software are estimated in some detail , but costs incurred by business departments in specifying , testing and implementing the system are rarely included adequately . On the other side of the coin , identifying and quantifying the benefits of any system can be a difficult , even impossible , task , as suggested above . In the book Information Economics , Parker and Benson , with Trainor ( 1988 ) assess in detail the ways in which information and systems benefits accrue and how they can be quantified to help in justifying investments . They consider three main types of application : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the main driving force , to improve efficiency . 2 Complementary : improving productivity and employee effectiveness by enabling work to be performed in new ways . 3 Innovative : intended to obtain or sustain competitive edge by changing trading practice , creating new markets etc . They then identify the ways in which applications should be justified , and define five basic techniques for evaluating benefits : 1 The traditional cost/benefit analysis , which allows for efficiency improvements in organisational processes from automation , e.g. preparing invoices and transmitting them electronically to customers via electronic data interchange ( EDI ) . 2 The " value linking " , which estimates the improvement in business performance , not just savings made , e.g. more accurate billing of customers or the ability to satisfy more customer orders from stock . 3 The " value acceleration " , which considers time dependency of benefits and costs in other departments of system improvements , e.g. being able to prepare invoices one day earlier , or giving sales data to buyers earlier , giving them more time to negotiate with suppliers . This implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , not where the system is actually implemented . 4 The " value restructuring " , which considers the productivity resulting from organisational change and change of job roles , e.g. information intensive tasks such as forecasting and planning can often only be improved by a combination of better systems and a change in organisational responsibilities . 5 The " innovation evaluation " attempts to evaluate the value to the business of new business or new business practices levered from IS/IT , e.g. the launch of a home banking service may change the company image and attract new types of customers . Summarising the ideas , it is suggested that costs and benefits should be appraised in both business and IS/IT " domains " in assessing any project . The above categories of benefit evaluation are suggested to be related to their application types and the portfolio classification , as shown in Figure 10.1 . By analysing costs and benefits using these techniques , the overall " economics " of an application can be assessed . The ideas are certainly more creative in interpreting information 's long-term value than traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quantify and express in financial terms as many of the costs and benefits as possible , it is not essential to convert all " intangibles " to financial figures . It is simply not possible to express all of the benefits of " systems " in quantitative terms , and it serves no useful purpose to develop spurious calculations to quantify the unquantifiable . If a new system will improve staff morale because at last the company has seen fit to invest in improving office functions and modernising the environment , how can that increase be expressed financially even after the event , let alone before it has happened ? However , as will be seen later , it is important to determine in advance how any intended benefit Evaluating IS/IT Investments 403 will be measured . In this case a staff survey would be an appropriate measuring instrument . What is more important is to use the appropriate basis for judgement of applications based on the role they are expected to fulfil in the business . The portfolio approach can offer help in making such judgements . The rationale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of the matrix is different , therefore the evaluation process should be different . The arguments used to justify a prototype expert system to model customer buying behaviour are not the same as those used to justify a rewrite of the general accounting system . Equally , response to a competitor 's action and a decision to integrate applications via a database require different approaches to evaluation . The risks of failure in the various segments are different . This can be allowed for by asking for a higher predicted rate of return where the risk is higher , although this may in turn merely lead to creative accounting for the benefits ! It is perhaps better to analyse the inherent nature of the risks and take appropriate action to deal with them , as far as possible , as will be outlined later . The portfolio approach suggests that : ? Quantified justification of applications is easier in the key operational and support quadrants , where all aspects of the application will be better known or can be determined , risks are lower and the rate of change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to produce one type of application to the exclusion of others . This argument is particularly strong where a scarce resource approach has been adopted , and pure financial return on investment decides whether projects go ahead and also the priorities . ? The way in which applications are planned and managed by the organisation will also affect the way in which they are justified ? whether they are cross-functional applications integral to achieving business objectives or systems intended to make major local economies . Figure 10.2 highlights some of the key points to be considered in the evaluation of applications in each segment . Support Applications The main argument for such systems is improving efficiency , which should be possible to quantify and convert into a financial argument for investment . Additional arguments may revolve around system and technology obsolescence and improving staff morale , and these may be 404 Managing IS and Technology Investments difficult to quantify . If the application development requires the use of scarce ( central ) resources , then in this segment it is reasonable to expect potential benefits to be estimated before resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the benefits achievable . Again , if the application is contending with others for the limited resource , then a support application must show a good economic return for the allocation of a scarce resource . If , however , the project can be carried out within the user department 's control then it is reasonable that , since the budget or funding is under local control , the " go /no go " decision is made by local user management . The IS/IT investment is an alternative use of funds to other investments locally and is not competing with alternative use of scarce IS/IT resources . Hopefully , user management will expect the case to be argued in predominantly financial terms , but if not that is their responsibility . In summary , assuming a scarce resource strategy is being adopted " centrally " for all support applications , then any allocation of that Evaluating IS/IT Investments 405 resource should be argued on economic , return on investment , grounds primarily . At the same time , some discretion can , without great risk , be left to local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce resource/free market in this segment will depend on how centralised or decentralised the organisation is overall . Key Operational Applications While as far as possible all costs and benefits of a new development/ **25;37;TOOLONG to a key operational system should be converted to a financial evaluation , this may not allow for all the arguments involved . For support systems it was suggested that benefits should be estimated before any resource is allocated or costs determined . This is inappropriate for key operational applications , where financial benefits are not the only driving force , and also the most economic solution may not be the most effective . This is the area for strict " feasibility study " to find the best solution from a range of alternatives , each with differing costs , benefits and risks . The business may suffer a serious disadvantage if a system falls behind the business needs . It also might be worth spending more to achieve an integrated solution , which meets a range of needs more effectively and upon which new strategic applications can be built . The relationship of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be included in the evaluation . Normally this will increase the cost and the " intangible " benefits . Some of those benefits will be able to be related to critical success factors ( CSFs ) , which by inference will , if achieved , lead to achievement of business objectives ( and vice versa if they are not ! ) . An argument often used here is " what will happen to the business if we do not invest in improving key operational systems ? " and therefore " can we afford the risk of not doing it ? " . Perhaps the term " critical failure factor " is more appropriate when considering the possible disadvantages of not investing . The strategy that works best for key operational systems is monopoly , which implies a central control and vetting of all applications and enhancements . This enables a standard checklist of questions to be considered in the evaluation of any new project . Factors that are important ( other than economic return ) from either a business or IS/IT perspective can be allowed for and , if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions based on only economic expediency rather than business benefits , although it may mean that a particular application may cost more in the short term . In conclusion , it should be stressed that for key operational systems 406 Managing IS and Technology Investments the business unit management should be the final arbiter . It is their business that will suffer by lack of investment and they should ( provided they can afford to pay ) be allocated the necessary resource to meet such systems needs , for whatever reason they feel the case is justified . Strategic Applications The fact that an application is deemed strategic implies that it is seen as important , even essential , in achieving future business objectives and strategies . Obviously , it is important to cost the investment and , where possible , put figures to the potential benefits , even if the latter are only orders of magnitude , not estimates suitable for a discounted cash flow calculation . However , the main reasons for proceeding are likely to remain " intangible " ? expressed as the CSFs that the application addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix is central planning , whereby IS/IT opportunities and threats are being considered along with the business issues and strategies . Hence , an application will get the " go/no go " decision based on whether it is relevant to the business objectives and strategy and likely to deliver benefits in those terms , not as a system in its own right . Whether this will actually happen is partly a question of luck ( that the target does not move ) , partly of judgement ( the quality of business acumen of senior managers ) , and partly good management of the application , as and when it is developed . The key issue is whether the management team , steering group or whatever body makes such decisions is unified in endorsing the project and that the " organisation " deems the investment worth while . The critical factor is then resourcing the task sufficiently to achieve the objectives in the optimum time scale . This may need repeated senior management intervention to ensure that both user and IT resources are made available . The budget for such investments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reside with the steering group to ensure that progress and resourcing are centrally monitored as well as planned . High Potential Applications The very essence of high potential projects is that the benefits are unknown . The objective in part is to identify the benefits potentially available . It is the R &D; segment of the matrix , and should be justified on the same basis as any other R &D; and preferably from a general R &D; budget rather than IS/IT central funds . In practice , where the money comes from ? R &D; budget or IS/IT or user budgets ? is important but Setting Priorities for Applications 407 not critical . What does matter is not pouring money down the seemingly bottomless pit that R &D; can become , if not properly monitored . The idea of " product champions " to be responsible for such projects , given a budget against agreed general terms of reference , to deliver results or otherwise , is the most effective way of initiating and managing the high potential stage in application life cycles . So , whatever the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " has control over the budget , and is accountable for its use . The word evaluation is what the high potential box is really about ? nothing should stay in it for too long or have too much money spent on it . When initial allocations are used up , further sums have to be rejustified , not just allocated in the vague hope of eventual success . This approach fits the leading edge and free market strategies that the box needs . However , it should be obvious that those responsible for ensuring that central planning works for strategic applications must be aware of what is being evaluated in the high potential segment , and by whom and to what purpose . The above approaches to application justification in the various segments may lack the precision ideally required . But this is no more than is true of other aspects of research and development , advertising , reorganisation , building new plant or facilities , taking on new staff or training people . IS/IT investments should be considered just as objectively and just as subjectively as other business investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the expected contribution required . SETTING PRIORITIES FOR APPLICATIONS As mentioned earlier , the mechanisms used to decide whether or not applications go ahead should also be used to set priorities across applications when all can not be done in parallel . Some priorities are logical ? project B can not proceed before project A has built the database , for example ? but many more are independent of each other . It is important to introduce some consistent , rational approach to priority setting if any strategy is to be implemented successfully . Short-term business pressures will change , projects will not proceed as planned , resources will not be available as expected , new opportunities and requirements will emerge . Each of these can change the priorities and unless a consistent rationale is employed , the short-term issues will override the strategy . In that short term , resources are limited and must be used to maximum effect . The main constraint is normally skilled IS labour , often in particular skill areas . 410 Managing IS and Technology Investments strate some , if as yet unclear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously contributing . Support systems should show little strategic contribution , otherwise they are more important , and key operational applications should relate to at least some CSFs . Setting priorities among key operational systems is more problematic than support or strategic , where the basic rationale is clearer . The arguments for ( i.e. benefits of ) key operational systems will essentially comprise : ? economic ? critical success factors ? risk to current business ? infrastructure improvement Each of these issues must be given some form of relative weighting to decide an order of preference before looking at resource constraints . In each case the cost/resources used by the project should be matched against its importance in each of the four categories to establish overall priorities . Economic benefits are straightforward , and business objectives can be included via CSFs . The IS/IT view of " infrastructure " implies implementing coherent architectures , increasing skills , improving the resilience or flexibility of systems etc . Risk to current business could be assessed by describing " what risks are run if the project does not go ahead " . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impact on the business , probability of occurrence and an assessment of when the risk might arise . Applications scoring highly in all four categories are obviously higher in priority than those scoring highly in one , two or three categories , and those at each level in the ranking using fewer resources get priority . It is a subjective method , but it does allow for the strategic , financial , user and IS/IT perspectives to be included . Buss ( 1983 ) makes an important observation concerning , as he says , the " misconception " that " a steering committee can decide the priorities " . In general , he suggests , politics may interfere , representation in discussion will be unbalanced and the only common ground will end up as economics ! He says the best way to set priorities is to make them the product of a formal planning process at corporate or business unit level . The mechanisms to be employed can be agreed by a steering group but it should not be implemented as a meeting based process . Hochstrasser ( 1990 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects or the priority setting process will remain arbitrary and chaotic . High potential applications are difficult to prioritise and will tend to be Setting Priorities for Applications 411 driven somewhat in the reverse of strategic applications ? what resource is available to do it and then which application might best employ that resource ? If , as suggested earlier , high potential applications are " individually " driven , a keen champion normally exists ; it is the secondary resources that are the problem . While it sounds wrong to suggest that " he who shouts the loudest " or " has the most influence " will obtain priority in this segment , it may be the best way to allow priorities to be set because : ? the results will depend not just on the value of the idea , but also on the force with which it is pursued ? setting objective priorities on scanty evidence is not very reliable anyway If the idea potentially impacts many CSFs , it clearly stands out from others and should be elevated above the general scramble for R &D; type resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not considered as being in competition for IS/IT funds , but are funded from R &D; general budgets . But , of course , they may compete for certain key skills or resources . The remaining task is to set priorities across the segments of the portfolio to decide how much resource to devote to the different types of applications . This is not simple since the rationale for investment in each is different , as shown above . However , the approach recommended for key operational applications can be extended out of the key operational domain . The problem is that strategic applications will score heavily on CSFs , whereas support applications will score heavily on " economics " . Management must decide the weighting they wish to attribute to each type of benefit and then rank the systems . The relative weighting given to each will depend on a number of factors , a few of which are listed in Table 10.1 . In general , the greater trust the management have in their own judgement relative to the need to be reassured by figures , and the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems , the greater the weighting placed on the CSFs etc. , relative to financial aspects . In a way , this is a sign of maturity of the organisation and how it plans and manages IS/IT . It also tends to reflect on the strength of the company within its industry . The stronger the position , the fewer IS/IT investments are expected ( like other investments ) to prove an economic case in advance . If the overall plan is developed and maintained in a priority sequence that reflects the ratio of benefits to be achieved ( adjusted for risk ) to limiting resource consumed , then it helps both in short- and long-term planning decisions because : ? Resources can be reallocated where necessary from lower to higher priority applications on a rational basis , with the agreement of users . ? Appropriate resourcing levels for the future can be set , and action taken to obtain the right type of resources to meet the demands , expressed as a consensus view of the benefits available . It is quite possible then to produce a " planning system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to date . It is important to " report " the current plan to all involved to aid understanding of the reasons for the ranking of any particular user 's project . Mystery or uncertainty are far more destructive of strategies than the discussion and reconciliation of real problems . Again , the above arguments may lack the precision ideally required for setting priorities . Much subjective judgement is inevitably involved , but rules for the various factors involved can be established sensibly , Benefit Management 413 rather than each priority decision effectively being made on a different set of criteria . BENEFIT MANAGEMENT In both the evaluation of projects and setting priorities , one aspect must not be ignored ? " after the event " . Some form of review ( not a witchhunt ! ) must be carried out on a high percentage of projects to identify whether ( i ) they were carried out as well as possible and ( ii ) whether the benefits claimed ( and possibly different benefits ) were achieved or not . One of the factors that differentiates successful from less successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thorough survey ( Brunel University/Kobler Unit , 1987 ) , is the management resolve to evaluate IS/IT investments before and after they occurred . There is no point in any sophisticated system of investment evaluation and priority setting unless the " system " is examined in terms of whether or not it delivers the business improvements required . While for evaluation purposes pre-investment appraisal and post-implementation review are obviously important , they are insufficient actions in terms of ensuring that the benefits required are delivered . The realisation of the benefits will depend upon changes to business activities associated with the new information system . A survey of approaches to managing IS/IT benefits in 60 major organisations ( Ward , Taylor and Bond , 1995 ) reveals that only 10% of them had any defined process as a basis for management action to deliver the benefits on which investments are justified . Only 26% of the companies always reviewed projects after completion to determine whether benefits were delivered ? a finding in line with earlier surveys . In the same survey , 76% of organisations believed there was significant scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As with previous surveys , most respondents believed that their organisation 's investment appraisal processes were not appropriate for the types of investment being undertaken , and 45% admitted overstating the benefits to gain approval , in the full and certain knowledge that no evaluation would be made after implementation ! What is also clear from the literature and the survey is that it is becoming increasingly difficult , given the types of systems being implemented , to predict all of the benefits that can be delivered in advance . Nearly 90% of the survey respondents expressed this view . That increases the importance of having a process that actively addresses the management of benefits throughout the investment 's life . In particular , any post-implementation review should focus not only on what has 414 Managing IS and Technology Investments happened in terms of delivered benefits , but should also consider what further benefits could now be gained . The survey described here was carried out as part of an extended research programme in conjunction with major UK organisations to develop improved approaches to ensuring IS/IT benefit realisation . Key aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work are described below . They attempt to address issues raised by some of the obvious conclusions from this and other surveys , i.e. : 1 Very few organisations have a benefits management approach to complement their systems development , project management and investment appraisal approaches . In most cases , all that exists is some set of techniques to examine potential benefits , sufficient for an investment justification to be produced and perhaps a review process after the project is complete to determine whether or not benefits were achieved . It does seem odd that so much attention is paid to ways of justifying investments , when so little effort is apparently expended on ensuring that the benefits expected are realised . 2 Many organisations ( 86% ) are appointing business project managers to improve the business relevance and delivery of systems . Among their other responsibilities , it would seem that probably the most important should be the identification and delivery of the benefits of the investment . However , in most organisations they are offered little guidance ? barely a checklist ? on what this responsibility involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BENEFITS MANAGEMENT A major IS/IT development will consist of a large number of activities in business areas and the IT function . Any particular development will also rely upon an ongoing set of activities , which provide the " infrastructure " upon which the new system is built and will rely for successful operation . That is not just a technology infrastructure but also a business infrastructure , which is capable of defining its information and processing needs and using the systems successfully . In essence , therefore , any major IS/IT development will consist of the mix of activities shown in Figure 10.4 . The percentages overlaid on the diagram are from the previously mentioned survey . The initial figure is the number of organisations that have a " methodology " and that in parentheses is the percentage of the total survey who think it is effective in delivering successful systems . 416 Managing IS and Technology Investments appropriate way to agreed quality and performance requirements . As such , it will require an infrastructure that enables this to occur for every project . ? Project management methodology ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resources associated with a project to deliver the system to agreed times and costs . As mentioned above , most organisations recognise that this is a shared responsibility between business and IT management , but it is the business that suffers the real consequences of poor project management . ? Investment appraisal methodologies are part of the infrastructure since they will be the determinant of whether , or which , investments are made , and hence the plan of developments . This is somewhat simplistic , but Figure 10.4 does show that , given the set of activities that needs to be managed successfully in combination , one " process " rarely present is defined here as : ? Benefit management : the process of organising and managing business activities such that potential benefits can be identified and the necessary changes are made to deliver those benefits . The activities could be particular to a development ( such as organisational changes or new customer related activities ) or more general ( e.g. training staff in the use of personal computers ) . The ability to achieve benefits from one investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what benefits IS/IT can or can not deliver and how they can be obtained . Based on the different objectives and rationale for the applications in each segment of the application portfolio , it can be seen that the mix of activities and their criticality to success will vary . Strategic applications imply that significant business changes will need to be made in association with the new system to create the desired advantage . Equally , understanding and defining the benefits required will need considerably more innovative thinking than , say , buying a new accounting package . Figure 10.5 summarises the generic sources of benefit for the different segments in the matrix . These align closely to the " information economics " concepts shown in Figure 10.1 . Given that the purpose of any IS/IT investment is to deliver improvements to business and /or organisational performance , it would seem logical that the primary process , around which the others should revolve , is the benefit management process . Currently it would appear that either the investment appraisal or systems development process is the one at the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new view . The Benefits Management Process 417 In considering the activities required to manage the delivery of benefits , it has been assumed that the IT based system is delivered to specification . However , as the benefits management process proceeds it may cause revision to the specification , but once more it is assumed that effective change control processes can deal with this . The other related set of activities are organisational changes of many types that have to be made to deliver the benefits . The benefits management process should be the driving mechanism for these change activities . How to bring them about in detail is addressed in the wealth of change management and organisational development literature . The model proposed here for benefits management processes draws heavily on total quality management approaches and the work on IT benefits management in the NHS . The five steps in the iterative process are described in outline in the following subsections ( see Figure 10.6 ) . Each stage is considered in overview from the viewpoint of the business management roles and responsibilities . 418 Managing IS and Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for embarking on the application development . Based on the outcome of the strategic planning processes , the business rationale for a new or improved system is identified : the nature of the types of target benefits will depend on whether the system is strategic , key operational or support , as described earlier . If the nature of the benefits and /or how to obtain them is unclear then the system should be put through the R &D; process implied by the high potential segment until they are known . Hence , the whole benefit management process does not really apply to the high potential segment , except that it is a way in which the benefits can be identified or assessed in terms of how best to achieve them . Identifying the target benefits implies an iterative process of discussing what the system objectives are and the business performance improvements that the system should deliver . In the NHS , a checklist of potential benefits that might be available has been developed to assist this assessment . This allows managers to consider a wider range of potential improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time from a blank sheet and creating a list from scratch . The list of benefits required must be agreed by the managers whose activities are affected by the system . Each of the benefits should be tested against the " benefit drivers " in the organisation ? i.e. the business The Benefits Management Process 419 objectives and CSFs ? to ensure that they are relevant and desired by the management . At the same time , potential " disbenefits " of the system should be considered , i.e. what adverse impacts on the business or organisation it could have . These may be deemed unacceptable , hence the objectives or scope of the system should be revised or actions put in hand to ensure that these disbenefits are avoided . No one wants nasty surprises at the end of the implementation . So , as far as it is possible , these should be anticipated at the start of the development process . All business performance improvements are measurable , and hence so are all of the benefits delivered by information systems . Some can be measured directly in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation , decrease in product rejects due to quality control data , reduction in stock levels through a warehouse control system . Many of these can also be converted easily into financial values ; where this can be done , it should be done , to enable an economic appraisal to be made . In other cases the measurement may be less direct . Better timing and control of deliveries should lead to more satisfied customers , which in turn may lead to increased sales or at least avoiding lost sales due to delivery problems . The level of customer satisfaction will need to be measured and some estimate made of the business benefits of improved delivery . These quantified benefits may not , however , be suitable to undergo rigorous discounted cash flow calculations . In essence , every target benefit should be expressed in terms that can , in due course , be measured , even if the measure will be subjective , e.g. customer or staff opinion . These measurable improvements will be reviewed in Stage 4 of the process . As an example , Frito-Lay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hand-held computers . The prototype system showed that this saved about 3 ? 4 hours of administrative effort each week . The sales managers were asked to decide what that time saving could deliver as a benefit . It was agreed that each sales/delivery person should be able to increase their sales by between 3% and 10% per week , given the increased selling time available and their different customer mixes . This became one of the target benefits to be delivered by the system , and after implementation this was measured . An average of 6% , over and above general market growth , was achieved . The final part of this stage is the determination of where in the business ( or even in trading partners ) the benefits should occur , and hence who in the organisation should be responsible for their delivery . This is a logic often overlooked in bringing in new systems , but " ownership " of the benefits and clear allocation of responsibility for delivery is vital to success . This is easy to identify if the system is 420 Managing IS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is more difficult when the system crosses functions , and especially when reorganisation and rationalisation of tasks across functions are essential to the delivery of benefits . Responsibility may have to be shared , but then this must be made explicit . In all cases , it is essential that a manager is made accountable for the delivery of each of the intended benefits . Any benefits lacking such ownership are removed from the list ! In most organisations , given that the investment could be costed etc. , an investment proposal would be put forward at this point , but that should not happen until after Stage 2 . Stage 2 : Planning Benefits Realisation Having identified and allocated responsibility for benefits to individuals ( or perhaps teams ) , it is their task to consider the stakeholders affecting delivery of each benefit and the changes and tasks needed to ensure delivery . The purpose is to understand those organisational ( and possibly customer or supplier ) factors that will affect the organisation 's ability to achieve the required improvements . The first task is to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is often seen simplistically as whoever is paying for it and the IT specialists ! In reality , anyone affected by the system or the process of development is a stakeholder and the view they take of the investment may influence the outcome . The term " enabling benefits " is used to describe the " what 's in it for me ? " problem of IS/IT investments . Often projects fail because of the lack of cooperation of parties who were not considered material to the system 's success . " Enabling benefits " are those that the project may have to deliver to individuals or groups to engage their active cooperation in delivering the real business improvements required . Alternatively , the analysis will enable stakeholder views , which may cause potential negative effects , to be identified and dealt with through other actions . This is very closely aligned with Hochstrasser 's ( 1990 ) concept of " inhibitors " . The other reason for the analysis of stakeholder interests is to consider aspects of business change outwith the particular project , and the possible implications in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reorganisation and possible changes in key stakeholders may have a significant impact . The whole process of assessment here is to obtain ownership and buy-in of relevant individuals and groups , and to identify organisational factors that will enable or disable the achievement of the benefits , or otherwise significantly affect the outcome . They should also identify resources , costs and risks associated with The Benefits Management Process 421 making the necessary changes , and develop a plan for the delivery of the benefit , which is agreed by the key stakeholders involved and affected . If no such plan for the necessary changes required to realise the benefit can be produced , the intended benefit should be removed from the list . It will be necessary to establish interim targets and measures to monitor progress towards ultimate achievement of the target just like any good plan ! Only when this has been completed for all of the required benefits should funding for the IS/ IT investment be sought . The main purpose at this stage of the process is to increase the likelihood of delivering what is claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any plan , the next stage is to carry it out and adjust it as necessary , as issues arise affecting its achievement . Monitoring progress against the activities and deliverables of this plan is just as important as for the IS/IT development plan , and the two plans interact . It will be necessary to replan , and issues may arise that prevent the delivery of some or even all of the benefits . It is the business project manager 's responsibility to decide what action to take in terms of reviewing the scope and specification of the system or its business justification . It may be that during this stage further benefits are identified , and again the business project managers should decide on appropriate action to plan for the benefit or defer it until Stage 5 . Stage 4 : Evaluating and Reviewing Results Once the IT based system and the benefits realisation plan have been implemented , there must be a formal review of what was and was not achieved . This evaluation has two purposes : 1 to maximise the benefits of the particular project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should involve all of the key stakeholders and focus on what was achieved , what has not ( or not yet ) been achieved and why , and identify further action needed to achieve it , if possible . The reasons for lack of achievement may be due to problems in any of the earlier stages , hence they may have to be revisited to correct the situation . There is also another aspect of this review , which is to identify if any unexpected benefits have actually been achieved and , if so , how they came about . This again may prove valuable input to the first stage of the process in future projects . 422 Managing IS and Technology Investments It is worth repeating that any post-implementation review should not become a " witchhunt " ; it must be an objective process with future improvements in mind , not a way of placing blame for past failures . If it is seen as a negative process , honest appraisal and a constructive critique of what has happened become impossible and the whole process falls into disrepute or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the IT quality and project management issues surrounding the application development , again with a view to sharing knowledge and experience for the benefit of future systems . That is often in place in organisations but it tends to be held behind the closed doors of the IT department . This review is a business review aimed at maximising the benefits gained from the particular system and for all future IS/IT investments . Stage 5 : Potential for Further Benefits Much of the research referred to earlier has shown that it is often impossible to identify all of the benefits of a system in advance . Further benefits often become apparent only when the system has been running for some time and the associated business changes have been made . If , as has been suggested , more benefits are actually identifiable after the event than before it , where there is no review process then these will never be identified . Therefore , having reviewed what has happened , it is equally important to consider what further improvement could now be possible as a result of implementing the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to stage 1 and involving the original stakeholders and any others who may be able to contribute . The process is to identify possible further improvements to feed into the first stage of a new iteration of the process . If this is not done , many opportunities may be missed . If maximum value is to be gained from the overall investment in IT , benefit identification should be a continuing process , from which IS/IT projects are defined . Often in the past the project was defined first then benefits were " created " in order to justify the cost . IS/IT planning should be driven by the delivery of a benefit stream , which improves business performance at the optimum manageable rate . BENEFIT MANAGEMENT : SUMMARY In the 1970s it became clear that the activities involved in the IT aspects of IS development could be brought together into a coherent structure to improve the reliability and quality and reduce the costs of the process . Risk Management 423 Only in the early 1990s have many organisations come to realise that a similar structured framework is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits . Few organisations have any process in place that resembles in total or contains all of the elements described above . Most organisations now recognise that to get " value for money from IT " , they must actively manage the value component as well as the costs . Understanding of the full range of issues involved in achieving the benefits is incomplete . No framework is yet available that will fit the needs of all types of applications , the wide variety of benefits they can deliver or the different circumstances within which they must be achieved . The process described here , including many more detailed tools and techniques involved in each stage , has been used to evaluate what actually happened on a number of major projects in large companies . Some of these were trying actively to manage the benefits , others were not . Using the process model it was possible to diagnose why some projects were successful in delivering benefits and others were not . In the assessment it was also possible to show how the less successful could be addressed with remedial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most cases more extensive benefits than had been previously identified were uncovered . RISK MANAGEMENT As part of the appraisal of investment viability , it is essential to assess the potential risks . Firstly , it is worth considering why systems projects fail , and who is responsible for the failure , according to its reason for occurring . The diagram in Figure 10.7 is adapted from extensive research into the reasons for information systems failure by Lyytinen and Hirschheim ( 1987 ) . Failure can occur in five domains , which , from the inside outwards , are : 1 Technical failure : this is clearly the domain of IT , who are responsible for the technical quality of the system and the technology it uses . Technical failure is now usually the easiest and often the cheapest to overcome . 2 Data failure : this is a shared responsibility between IT and the users ? who input the data . Obviously , good data design , processing integrity and sound data management practice are the IT responsibility , but not everything can be legislated for and the effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user domain . 3 User failure : while blame for the user misunderstanding the system or being ineptly advised or trained may accrue to the IS/IT professionals , the primary responsibility for using the system appropriately and to its maximum capability must rest with the user management . Many systems become less effectively used over time as staff change and training investment is insufficient . 4 Organisational failure : systems maybe satisfactory in meeting particular functional needs but may fail because they do not satisfy the organisation overall , its operations and their interrelationships . For example , a budgetary control system specified for and by accountants at the centre may fail to meet the needs of line managers to plan and control different types of business expenditure . Responsibility here clearly lies outside the IS/IT domain , and must be shared by users and senior management for not aligning systems to organisational needs . The Lyytinen and Hirschheim analysis considers only these four domains , but a fifth and potentially more serious area of failure exists ; coping effectively with this will become more critical as the IS/IT investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business environment : the systems are or become inappropriate to the market requirements due to changing business practice instigated by others , or by not supporting a changing business strategy adequately or simply by not coping with the Risk Assessment and Management 425 volume and speed of business process needs economically . The responsibility for this is essentially senior management 's , although without active user and IT input they can not be expected to identify the problems , but they must underwrite action to correct them . The front page of Computing on 6th October 1988 carried the headline , " Catalogue King Looks Up Cost of TP Shortfall " and went on to describe how Great Universal Stores estimated that they had lost ? 133 million of sales because " its computer systems are out-of-date " . With modern on-line integrated systems " there is no doubt that we could have done an extra 5% on our current sales " , to quote a director . The systems had clearly failed to meet the needs of a rapidly changing mail-order business environment , although they had a 45% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , Ewusi-Mensah and Przasnyski ( 1994 ) conclude that economic and technical factors were not major factors in contributing to management decisions to abandon projects before completion . Most were abandoned due to organisational factors such as loss of management commitment and political and interpersonal conflicts , i.e. these are serious areas of potential risk in a project . Interestingly , for the majority of projects they studied , of which 40% were considered " strategic " and 60% were " urgent " , 85% were not seen as high risk at the start and 64% were expected to deliver considerable benefits . The riskiness of IS/ IT has been brought back into focus in recent years in the UK , with the well-publicised failure of a number of large projects , such as those in the Stock Exchange ( TAURUS ) , the London Ambulance Service and the Performing Rights Society . Risk assessment and management is therefore of critical importance for many investments . RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT In essence , this part of the chapter is to address a problem that the earlier parts of the chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to bring structure and certainty to the process of information systems developments , they are often still inherently risky adventures at times . Much has been written about how to assess the risks involved , usually from a technical or IT viewpoint , but the approach described here focuses on the risks of not achieving the benefits . While technical risks obviously affect this , there are many other risk factors within the power of management to avoid or deal with . The whole point in assessing risks is to understand them , such that the development scope or process can 426 Managing IS and Technology Investments be changed to avoid them or action taken during the process to deal with them . The risks of each development need to be assessed in order to improve the chances of success , but management need to understand the relative risks of all of the developments in the portfolio in order to set sensible priorities , as mentioned earlier . This means comparing the risks of strategic , key operational and support applications in a consistent way . ( High potential systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to minimise the consequences of the risk in business and financial terms . ) By reviewing a number of approaches to risk assessment , a synthesised approach can be produced , which enables a common set of risks to be considered for every project but whereby the potential impact of the risk is of different severity for strategic , key operational or support systems . A detailed scoring system and action checklist have been developed by the author ( Ward , 1993 ) , based on an MBA project thesis by Bentley ( 1991 ) . It is beyond the scope of this chapter to explain that method in detail but the principles are important . In considering how the benefits arise in the different segments of the application portfolio , they are summarised as follows : 1 Strategic systems : the benefits are the result of innovation and change in the conduct of business to gain a competitive edge . This normally requires restructuring of some business processes and/or changing the relationships with trading partners , and implies some uncertainty about the business implications of the system . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business processes more effectively overall , and normally result from rationalisation , integration or reorganisation of existing processes . The main objective is to avoid business disadvantages . While the business issues are probably well understood , risks often arise due to the complexity of the system and its links to other existing systems . 3 Support systems : the benefits come mainly from carrying out business tasks more efficiently by removing them , or by automation to reduce the cost of carrying them out . The business functions involved are normally stable and well understood , and there is also a wide range of packaged software available to use . The risks arise from knowing how to implement such software effectively and so gain the available benefits . High potential projects do not actually deliver finished , operational systems and hence real benefits , and are dealt with as " high risk " by treating them as R &D; projects . Therefore , they are not considered in more detail here . By limiting the budget for the high potential stage of Risk Assessment and Management 427 any development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity available or deciding to invest heavily in a " loser " ? these are difficult to allow for in a structured risk assessment . In considering the factors that affect the delivery of the required benefits of any IS/IT project , three are obviously key to its success : 1 Time : when the business needs it 2 Quality : a system that does what it should 3 Cost : that was worth incurring In an ideal world all three should be achieved ? a perfect system , when needed , at the optimum cost . However , being realistic , it is difficult to achieve all three on any IS/IT project . The evidence from the past is that in many IS/IT projects none of the three is achieved ! That is mainly due to the risks being misunderstood and partly due to not understanding which of the three variables ? time , quality or cost ? was critical to the particular system 's success . The criticality of each will vary in the different segments of the application portfolio . If perfection in all three is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most critical , otherwise the window of opportunity may be lost and associated business changes become infeasible or difficult : cost is less critical to overall success . That is not to say that cost should be ignored ! In the other two segments , quality is most critical for key operational systems to avoid them failing the business and cost is most critical in support systems , if economic benefits are to be maximised ( see Figure 10.8 ) . The approach outlined here weights the risk factors differently in the three segments , in order to accommodate the different impacts they are likely to have on overall success . From the research , risk categories and factors have been determined , which ? either individually or in combination ? have to be dealt with in order to minimise the chances of : ? not achieving the desired benefits ? not achieving the necessary timing ? using more resources than needed The effects of the latter two will not only reduce the net benefits of the particular application , but will also reduce the ability to gain the total benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risk Categories , Factors and Potential Impact A search of the literature identified a number of major risk factor categories and within these a list of specific factors that can be demonstrated to reduce the likely success of IS/IT projects . There is 428 Managing IS and Technology Investments considerable agreement on what those factors are , and they are described below . The potential impact of the factors can then be considered against the key success factors for the different types of applications ? strategic , key operational and support ? based on the effect they have on the balance of the time , quality and cost parameters . A simple impact assessment approach can be used , which attempts to describe the impact if the factor is not satisfactorily addressed : ? H ( high risk ) : the project is unlikely to succeed unless action is taken to deal with the risk before the project starts . ? M ( medium risk ) : contingencies need to be considered in case the risk leads to project problems . ? L ( low risk ) : should have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining the appropriate commitment and involvement of senior management , ensuring that the project team includes the right 430 Managing IS and Technology Investments mix of business and technical skills , and ensuring that the communication between business users and system deliverers is effective . Weaknesses in any of these areas can cause misunderstandings at the earliest stages of projects , which lead to major problems later . As can be seen from Table 10.2 , each factor has a different potential impact , especially the first two . Senior management involvement in strategic projects is essential , but can lead to confusion and unnecessary interference in support projects . Project Size It is almost self-evident that large projects are more difficult to manage than small ones , and since large projects are normally expected to deliver large benefits the consequences of failure are far more significant . Size can be best expressed as the number of total person-years work required , but the problem is compounded by both the number of different individuals involved and the elapsed time taken ? more things change over a longer time period , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects will depend on the organisation . Control of the Project Control of the project is a set of factors describing how rigidly the time , quality and cost aspects of the project are to be controlled in terms of milestones , standards , methodology , budgets and change management processes . To succeed with strategic projects requires a degree of flexibility in how things are done in order to achieve early delivery of the system , whereas for key operational systems quality should not be compromised for expediency . Support systems deliver mainly economic benefits , so managing expenditure is important but timing of delivery is less critical ? economic benefits are always available . Complexity Again , it is obvious that the more complex the problem the more difficult it is to ensure a good solution . Complexity can arise in both the business and the technology , and this is usually compounded by the number of different business functions that need the new system and the number of other systems with which it must be integrated or interface . As with the other categories , the potential impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment , achieving simplicity of systems functions will lead to low cost solutions . In the other two Allocating or Charging Out Costs 431 segments , complexity will exist and must be accommodated in the timing and method of quality control . Novelty This concerns both the amount of business change needed to obtain the benefits and the novelty of the technical solution proposed . If both apply , the risks become very high but in many cases , other than support systems , change or technical novelty are an essential ingredient if the benefits are to be obtained . Stability of Requirements Again , the more certain the future is , the easier it is to ensure that the system will deliver the benefits . By careful definition of the project scope , certainty can be increased by tackling more stable areas and leaving others for later . However , other aspects of the business may be changing which could have a direct or indirect effect on the system . These need to be considered . The brief overview above is intended to summarise the risk factors and categories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pages , as would explaining the questionnaire and the particular scoring system that can be used to operationalise it . The impact assessment is summarised in Table 10.2 . It is based on the literature research , modified to map onto the matrix , by consideration of the nature of each type of application development . This approach is relevant to most IS/IT projects , although some , because of their uniqueness or sheer size , incur additional risks . Griffiths and Willcocks ( 1994 ) have reviewed such projects and compared relative success and failure in terms of the risks involved . ALLOCATING OR CHARGING OUT COSTS Before completing this chapter on managing IS/IT investments , it is worth considering how what is often seen as an administrative or accounting procedure can influence the selection and management of those investments . Figure 10.4 includes " infrastructure " activities and " IT/business relationship " processes . One of these processes is the means by which IT costs are allocated or charged to the business areas . l low this process is used and perceived can have an impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how business users are made accountable for their development and operational costs . 432 Managing IS and Technology Investments Few aspects of IS/IT management have attracted as much academic attention or user dissatisfaction as so-called " chargeback systems " ? ways of either allocating IT costs to users or charging them for services used . Why is this rather irritating aspect of IS/IT management , which should perhaps be a minor accounting issue , of any importance in strategic management ? Because what may appear as charge-out to the accountant and IT department is seen as a pricing mechanism by the user . If the charge is a crude overall cost reallocation of a relatively arbitrary nature , which the user can neither influence nor control , he or she will probably ignore it . Otherwise the charging system can significantly affect the implementation of strategy , as decisions are made on the price of systems and services prevailing at the time of the decision . What must be remembered is that such charge-out systems are really transfer pricing systems for the buying and selling of IT products and services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group is set up as a profit centre , or even a separate company , then the charge to users is obviously a real price . The merits of such an acceptance of the pricing mechanism are strongly argued by Allen ( 1987 ) in terms of the benefits accruing when information service groups are made to " pay their way " . He argues that when IT is managed as a profit centre , it will provide a " better service because it is rewarded for successfully responding to the users " and " users determine their own budgets " . Many of the organisations who outsource IT argue that if the users have to pay " real money " for services , they will be more accountable and demand a good service , although given there is no choice of suppliers , this logic is a little weak . It must of course follow that : ? users can select the most appropriate supplier ( internal or external ) ? the IT supplying department can refuse " unprofitable " work This arrangement is close to the definitions of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit centre approach is not appropriate where the IT department is technologically backward or poorly managed , because the users will choose outside suppliers in preference for most needs , and the IT department will not improve . If a free market strategy is appropriate then so perhaps is a profit-centre approach , but it could be seen as the need for effective charging and user accountability determining the strategy , not the reverse . Deardon ( 1987 ) argues that making IT a profit centre is the first step on its inevitable journey to oblivion . Charging out/pricing of development costs is relatively straightforward since the majority of IT costs are labour hours plus capital expenditure . Either a market or internal labour recovery rate can be used . The total Allocating or Charging Out Costs 433 project development cost can be identified relatively easily and performance against targets reviewed , either against a fixed " contract " cost or original estimate . Whether any over/under run is attributed to the IT " supplier " or to the user " customer " is largely academic , but may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problematic as a result of changing economic factors and usage of resources over an extended period . The CIMA Management Accounting Guideline No. 4 , Charging for Computer Services , recognises that : " The problems of calculating a transfer price for computer services are complicated by the specialised nature of the services , their independence from the saleable end products of most businesses and the difficulty of matching the demand for computer services with their supply in the short and medium term . " Many charging systems for computer services are complex in design to address these problems , producing elegant accounting solutions but often ignoring the fact that transfer pricing is a matter of business policy , to enable overall business , not just IT and accounting , objectives to be met . Most writers on this subject describe some or all of the objectives that Olsen and Ives ( 1982 ) list for charge-out systems : ? to provide the basic accounting functions of cost recovery ? to maximise IS benefits ? to ensure equitable resource allocation among users ? to regulate demand for scarce resources ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance ? to make users accountable for resources consumed A study carried out by Bergeron ( 1986 ) showed that if users are to be held accountable for meeting their IT budget , they must be involved in its preparation and they must be charged in proportion to the services they use . In order for this to happen , the charges to users have to be understandable to the users . If they are difficult to understand , they will not be used . These findings are similar to those of Olsen and Ives , and apply to both project development and systems operational charges . Earl ( 1989 ) goes further , suggesting that the charges should be based on things the user can see and influence , e.g. the number of transactions , screens viewed etc. 434 Managing IS and Technology Investments Returning to the objectives listed above , no charging mechanism will meet all of the objectives , so it is important that the objectives for charging for IT services are specifically stated and understood by everyone . The least contentious objective is the first ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case IT can be treated like any indirect function and its costs allocated on some sensible , if rather arbitrary , basis to " direct " departments to satisfy management accounting requirements . Of the other objectives , three ? 3 , 4 and 5 ? are essentially about " planning " or regulating supply or demand , and it would seem that using the charging system is no substitute for putting effective IS and IT planning mechanisms in place . Equally , using charging as a way of maximising IS benefits is difficult to understand , in that it can only affect how costs are dealt with . However , as has been said earlier , few organisations have processes for managing the benefits of IS/IT investments , hence the undue focus on the costs of IT . The remaining two objectives ? 6 and 7 ? are about accountability and performance measurement , both of which should be important in ensuring that resources are used effectively . It is to satisfy these objectives that most chargeback systems are actually designed . McKinnon and Kallman ( 1987 ) argue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maturity of IS and its management in the organisation . They use the support-key operational-high potential-strategic rationale of an increasingly important application portfolio to demonstrate the need for increasing sophistication of charging/pricing mechanism . They argue that prices and the pricing mechanism should be clearly aligned with IS/IT policy , either encouraging use or trying to control it , and either encouraging freedom of user choice or directly influencing priorities . Irrespective of the detailed methods used , pricing is , and must be employed as , an instrument of strategy . Taking this rationale further , Earl ( 1989 ) argues that the charge-out systems should reflect the role of IS/IT as a component of the business . He argues that IT is normally seen in one of three roles : 1 A service centre , whereby users are not charged in any way for IT resource consumption . 2 A cost centre , whereby users are charged with costs representing the resources consumed such that IT costs are " recovered " from the other functions . 3 A profit centre , whereby the IT function charges a price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than recover their total costs . As has been said earlier , this implies a free market strategy , hence the price will depend as much on what the customer will pay as on the costs of the services ? " market pricing " . Where IT is treated as a cost centre , the charging method can either be based on average costs ? i.e. charging the total cost of the resource ( e.g. network ) to the users in proportion to the use each makes of it ? or standard costs , where resources are charged as they are used , the cost being calculated in advance based on estimated usage . The latter method , while administratively more cumbersome , at least means that the users can relate activity to costs incurred . Also , efficiency and volume variances are not hidden , and this encourages more careful use of the resource and better forecasting ? avoiding wasted capacity , enabling more accurate sizing of resources and more timely procurement of extra capacity . Earl considers the implications of the charging methods resulting from these three fundamentally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the context of the application portfolio . These implications are summarised in Table 10.3 . Although none of the approaches is ideal in any situation , it can be seen that , if used sensibly , the methods of charging can address the issues associated with key operational , support and high potential applications ? i.e. charging methods should not cause inappropriate behaviour . However , Earl recognises that none of the charging methods is suitable for strategic applications and he believes a fourth approach is needed ? the hybrid ( see Table 10.3 ) . Here , the way in which charges are made for a particular application will be determined by the nature of that application on the basis of ensuring that the intended benefits are obtained . This can cause problems in accounting terms , but the flexibility is essential if innovative , cross-functional , change driven systems are to be developed . The focus is on benefit achievement , not costs incurred ; in many organisations the charging system creates Summary 437 discussion about " who pays " , not " who benefits " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to bring together the application portfolio , the role of the IT resource and the method of charging . It also includes the generic strategies that relate reasonably logically to the bases for charging , again meaning that the behaviour required will be encouraged by the charging method . Like many things about IS/IT management , there are clear cause and effect relationships . Charging policy becomes a pricing policy in the eyes of the user , and inappropriate charging methods will lead to inappropriate use of resources to deliver the wrong set of applications . There are no simple answers , and Table 10.4 suggests that a set of policies may be necessary ? adopting different charging methods according to the type of application . Given that there is a need to manage strategically to get an increased business contribution from IS/IT investments , it is probably obvious that one policy instrument that can be used to enable that strategy is the pricing of the IT resources . It is , however , a very unpredictable instrument if used carelessly , and it may be best not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the potential effect of the charging system is to nullify or even counteract the strategy . SUMMARY The purpose of all investments in IS/IT is to deliver improvements in aspects of organisations ' activities . Some may be in response to legislative or regulatory requirements , and must be done to avoid breaching laws or regulations . Most , however , are discretionary ? the money could always be spent on other things ? and IS/IT investments compete for the funds available and , perhaps more significantly , the time and priorities of people in the organisation . If the benefits are to be delivered , the commitment of resources and skills over an extended period is required . Most of the literature in the field focuses on " appraisal " , not " management " . IS/IT investments are inherently risky , many fail to deliver the intended benefits ? some because the benefits were never achievable , others because the risks were not identified or understood and many because the development was inadequately managed . This cha pter has attempted to describe an overall , balanced approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delivering the available benefits . IS/I'I ' investments are becoming more and more complex in terms of the way in which they impact an organisation 's performance . Gaining 438 Managing IS and Technology Investments the benefits from IS/IT is demanding more changes in business practices , and even in organisational roles and structures . It is often the changes associated with the implementation of an application that deliver business improvements . This chapter has dealt with application investments , rather than infrastructure investments , which are considered in Chapter 12 . Applications are the means by which infrastructure investments can deliver benefits , other than lower IT costs . Applications , therefore , must explicitly or implicitly justify the costs of infrastructure through the benefits they deliver . Since the applications make different contributions to a business , as described by the applications portfolio , they need to be appraised in different ways . This is well understood but , as yet , methods of investment appraisal do not adequately reflect this complexity and the subtleties involved . The approach described here offers some practical guidance to the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also enables a number of key factors affecting IS/IT investment success to be dealt with in a structured and coherent way . Priority setting , while allowing for logical precedence of development and key resource availability , should be based on the same principles as investment appraisal to maximise the benefit stream from the plan . Obviously , the delivery of the ideal benefit stream will be affected by the risks of the individual projects . Therefore , the risk assessment process should be driven by the affect of the risks on delivering benefits , based on the nature of the benefits . Most of this is well known , if not always practised successfully . However , what is barely practised at all , given survey results , is the proactive management of the benefit delivery itself . Relatively new ideas , albeit applied common sense in many cases , have been described , which address this apparently widespread weakness in many organisations . The importance of post-implementation reviews is also emphasised as the means by which organisations can learn from experience , both good and bad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strategic planning is mainly in selecting the right things to do , but poor implementation , which fails to deliver the benefits of these " right things " , can easily negate the value of planning . The last part of the chapter introduced a different aspect of IS/IT " financial management " , which may seem peripheral to the main themes . Charge-out methods are part of the environment that can seriously influence the selection and justification of applications . These methods are instruments of policy which should reflect the strategic intent of the organisation and thus enable the benefits of strategic planning to be realised . In many organisations , poorly designed or inappropriate charge-out methods can constrain or even contradict the References 439 strategic intent . The methods should allow for the different contributions that IS/IT investments can make and encourage the most beneficial use of resources . An attempt has been made to show how this can be done . Chapter 11 describes different approaches to the actual development process for IS/IT applications within the overall framework of investment management . Chapter 12 considers the supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of managing infrastructure investment . 11 Managing Application Development INTRODUCTION The overall strategy for managing the application portfolio and some of the key strategies arising from it , namely organisation , information and investment management , have been considered in the previous four chapters . The focus for this chapter is the strategy for managing applications as development projects and operational systems , from the establishment of requirements to successful long-term use in the business . What is needed from an IT supply perspective is a coordinated series of responses covering application development as well as portfolio management , justification and benefit management , organisation etc . Objectives and principles for application development are derived from the business goals , which focus on competitive , customer , product development and delivery , and financial factors , and may include targets for responsiveness , flexibility and staff effectiveness . A sample set of application development objectives and principles is shown in Table 11.1 . A set such as this derived from interpreting the business strategy and IS demand would then form the basis of the application management strategy . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target benefits , represents the firm current and future demand to be satisfied by development activity . An application management framework , set up to meet business needs , is illustrated in Figure 11.1 . It contains : ? Clear objectives and principles for application development and management , which will meet the current demand and provide a 442 Managing Application Development ? Deliver cost effective applications with sustainable value to the business . ? Provide a faster development process , in order to keep up with the business-driven demand for new or revised applications . ? Build less prescriptive and more flexible applications , which are supportive of change , in line with more fluid business needs . At the same time , attempt to build applications that are insulated as far as possible from business change and technology change . ? Establish a style for application development that matches the business style . For example , if the business is evolving an open networked style , then it is likely that development methods suitable to a distributed networked technical environment will follow suit . ? Enable a wide span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fully in application development , and confirm or establish good working relationships with the user community . ? Support team working , or dispersed work groups , especially if there are business initiatives to redesign some business processes . ? Improve the productivity and effectiveness of business processes and people , including the IS/IT processes and people . ? Enable more participation in customer contact processes by more people . ? Enable more informed decision making . ? Increase the value delivered by legacy applications , at reduced cost . Also ensure that the practices that have made the legacy such a millstone are avoided for the future , remembering that once an application is implemented , it too becomes part of the heritage . ? Maximise reuse of existing application material , and at the same time minimise duplication where it could lead to waste of resources or inconsistency in business information or processes . ? Exploit to the fullest the useful potential in current technology and established tools . ? Enable improved access to information in operational , external and " warehouse " information stores , and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , ensure consistency in use of information . development environment that will match the business strategy for a protracted period . ? A cohesive and balanced framework for the development or acquisition of all types of systems , incorporating appropriate methods , tools and mechanisms for their development , management and maintenance , and support for the introduction of new technologies . ? A migration path of infrastructure projects for implementation of new methods and tools , including training , education and provision of support . ? A set of policies , standards and guidelines to cover the full scope of application development and support . The range that these would cover is shown in Table 11.2 . The migration path to equip the business with a satisfactory application management environment will inevitably be dependent on the degree and complexity of change needed , the costs and benefits , and any expected resistance . However , the primary driver will be the business needs , and these may need to be satisfied in parallel with significant changes in how application management is conducted . Several critical challenges may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed portfolio , there should theoretically be no applications backlog ? at least not in the form of a " user wish list " . There will be applications in the target portfolio with a lower priority than others , although with a prospective benefit to the business , linked to current business requirements . They may be developed before the portfolio is revised , if their business case is sound . When the portfolio is revised , in response to changes in the business strategy or new priorities , any remaining undeveloped applications may stay in the portfolio , with a priority that matches the changed circumstances , or may disappear , if their potential value has gone . Users ' expectations need to be well managed in this circumstance . 444 Managing Application Development ? Effective guidelines that help to equip the business with the right balance of rigour and flexibility in development methods and procedures to deliver cost effective solutions appropriate to the business need . ? Clear roles and responsibilities for all participants in the development process , for each approach adopted . These would include such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sponsor , project manager etc . ? Policies , standards and working procedures for development , maintenance , management , audit ( covering the process and products of development ) , change control , education , self-training and " help " facilities etc . ? Tools and mechanisms to ensure consistent application of methods , tools and management practices according to specified selection algorithms . ? Support for new skill areas , to make the methods and tools effective . ? Guidelines and practices to cover project management , quality management and measurement , configuration management , change management and demand management . Quality of Software Development and the Maintenance Burden In most installations maintenance of legacy applications uses up a disproportionate part of the IS budget , and this proportion must be reduced . This is partly because many legacy applications were not well structured when they were developed , and did not use structured approaches or have the benefit of productivity aids . They are likely to have lurched through a history of evolution to keep them abreast of changing business needs , becoming less adept at doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start with , are likely to be poorly documented after several years ' use . The legacy represents a very large investment , and usually contains some very critical key operational applications , so it is a core task of application management to keep these applications in a satisfactory state , while minimising maintenance expenditure , and also to exploit their unused potential to the fullest , if that adds needed value to the business . IS Development Process The development processes may be as creaky as any of the business processes , and , like them , becoming ever more inappropriate for the ways in which the business is operating and changing . They may need to become much more flexible , by adapting a broader set of approaches and tools to support personal , team , workgroup and corporate application development . They may need to move much closer to the business Introduction 445 community , so that business requirements can be met in a more natural and effective way than through the rigid formality of a strict systems development life cycle ( SDLC ) , and so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may be a good case for redesigning the development processes , their tools , methods , training and quality management , and extending the population of developers much more widely across the business , in terms of both professional and user developers . This would become the subject of an infrastructure project , perhaps preceded by some high potential work to pilot a new process , tools and development approaches . Transition This involves managing the transition from traditional mainframe development to effective development practices in distributed client/ server environments . Even without a redesign of the overall development processes , there is likely to be a gradual evolution taking place . If this is to be undertaken , there are further transitions accompanying this ? for tools , from third generation languages to tools that support graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) and object orientation ; and for methodologies , from the SDLC or other traditional approaches to ones suitable for development of client/server applications . Other aspects of such a transition include an increase in end user development , and a shift in the role of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentor and guide , and a provider of the information architecture and information resource management . The survey of key information systems management issues discussed in Chapter 3 pointed out a number of issues relating to application development , which were of concern to IS managers in 1987 . Table 11.3 lists these , and gives the ranking , out of the 23 issues surveyed . There were several issues concerning software development , as shown in the table , but they were not in the top third . By contrast , in the survey reported in 1994 by Galliers , Merali and Spearing , the " quality of software development " was ranked higher by IS managers , and higher still by non-IS managers . Table 11.4 shows its ranking as viewed by both groups . The survey also differentiated between the importance of the issue and how problematic it is . It also asked managers to consider it as it affected them at the date of the survey ( 1992 ) , and looking forward five years to 1997 . As the results show , IS managers believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less of a problem in the late 1990s . From this it might be deduced that they believe that the problem can be brought under control . Non-IS managers , on the other hand , think that in 1997 it will still be the most problematical issue , and only dropping three positions in importance . Perhaps this is in recognition of the fact that users will increasingly be responsible for developing and managing their own applications . Other issues considered , relating to application development , were : ? " Managing end-user computing " : this is not ranked in 1992 , and appears in a low position in the 1997 view of importance , especially by non-IS managers ? not surprisingly . It is placed about the middle of the " problematical " ranking by IS managers , and somewhat lower by the other group . ? " Decision support systems " : this jumps up the " importance " list in the view of both sets of managers , and remains about the same , viewed as problematical . DETERMINING THE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH Once the portfolio has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each entry defined , then development or acquisition can proceed . It may be undertaken by IS developers , users or jointly . Application management controls covering benefit management , inDetermining the Development Approach 447 vestment appraisal , project management , quality management , change control , configuration management and so on are applied in different ways , depending on the portfolio category and the chosen development approach . This may be formal , as in a full SDLC methodology , or relatively informal , incorporating rapid development methods and prototyping . The approach may incorporate a bought-in proprietary methodology , such as SSADM , or one that has been purpose-built in-house . In selecting the right development approach and tools , portfolio management principles are useful , as they are for so many other aspects of IS/IT management . In an organisation where applications are distributed around the portfolio model , it is likely that a variety of application development approaches are needed , to be put to use by different groups of people in the organisation , delivering products built to suit their end use . Broadly applied selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio categories are : ? Traditional systems development life cycle methods or bought-in highly integrated applications packages , such as MRPII , for key operational systems . ? Advanced database technology , embedded in a sophisticated development and information delivery environment , for strategic systems . ? Rapid development user-orientated tools for building high potential systems . ? Packaged proprietary software products for support systems . The richness of the menu of available development approaches must reflect the diverse needs of the portfolio , tempered by any underlying constraints . These will include economic considerations , technical limitations , and availability and accessibility of suitable ingredients ? organisational capability , skills and resources . With the benefit of an IS strategy , defining the business IS demand over several years , albeit with decreasing certainty over the longer term , an organisation can plan and justify its long-term development infrastructure with considerably more certainty than if it was only aware of short-term needs . The resulting development plan needs to take into account infrastructure projects for the progressive implementation of new methods and tools , in parallel with increasing capability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches on the basis of the application portfolio matrix gives a good provisional decision , which may then have to he varied when other criteria are considered . The four categories 448 Managing Application Development of the portfolio are now addressed from the point of view of selecting the most appropriate development approach . Consideration is also given to the relevance and use of software packages , functional complexity and the development skills needed in each category . Investment appraisal , priority setting , benefit management and risk management were discussed in the previous chapter . Factors relating to the technology strategy underpinning applications , such as capacity , disaster recovery and risk of failure are addressed in Chapter 12 . Collectively , these encompass most aspects of application management that need to be covered . STRATEGIC SYSTEMS These are vital to the future success of the business , and arise out of its business strategy . They are usually linked to specific business initiatives and are often critical to the attainment of competitive advantage . Traditional non-automated development methods are not appropriate here , as they tend to be slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user to define precise and detailed requirements . For strategic systems , speed and flexibility are essential , and effectiveness is more important than efficiency , especially when the goal is gaining and sustaining competitive advantage . The " window of opportunity " may be short-lived or uncertain . They are best achieved through a close partnership between business users ( preferably senior managers who understand the emerging business needs ) and very experienced IS/IT business analysts , to ensure that the business needs are analysed and met in the most effective way . This is doubly important when the system has an external linkage and is delivering benefits to both participants . There is often a need to develop further increments , along with extensions to the business initiatives , and it is vital that the logical analysis can be revisited easily and quickly . Typically , the system is not automating an existing business process , but evolving or creating one . It may form an add-on to a key operational system , providing a linking system to the external participant . Data Sources and Dependence on Other Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in strategic systems , whether the information is part of the product itself , or provided or exchanged in order to boost delivered value or customer satisfaction . Strategic systems frequently use data from various existing underlying source systems . The data in the strategic application will often need to be vertically integrated with these underlying systems , Strategic Systems 449 and may take data from outside sources as well . An example of this comes from the financial institutions , where relatively few banks are able to offer comprehensive cash management facilities to their customers , and these customers have frequently been lured away for some products by building societies , brokers , mutual funds and insurance companies . In winning them back , the difficulty lies in taking data from all of the underlying different product systems , which are account orientated , linking all of the accounts together by individual customer , then managing the customers ' accounts accordingly . The underlying product systems have evolved in a piecemeal fashion with relatively little control or thought towards the total view of , or relationship with , the customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operational ( and even support ) systems have been developed or redeveloped to use common integrated data architectures . Equally , these systems may rely on interfaces with existing key operational systems to follow through the processing of data to achieve the full business potential . For example , car hire and hotel reservations facilities are built on top of existing airline reservation systems , as are new products now offered through automatic teller machines ( ATMs ) , such as cash deposits , bill payments and financial transfer transactions . For these to be successful , there is a need for a very solid and firm architecture to the underlying system . If these are in any way weak , then building new strategic applications on top will inevitably expose these weaknesses , and could well cause the new strategic systems to collapse . Few organisations have developed successful strategic systems without first having established coherent and stable application and data architectures for key operational systems . Development Approach and Functional Complexity To create effective new applications , easy access to relevant information is very important , and often best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? associated with a sophisticated data dictionary , based on a corporate model of the business . Another approach may be to apply object orientation and develop a set of key objects , stored as reusable modules in a repository . Some objects may be created by " shrink wrapping " software modules taken from key operational systems . Both relational and object databases containing the principal elements of the corporate model give the necessary flexibility in terms of viewing , manipulating and accessing information . A scenario may serve to illustrate the point . When contact is made between a company and one of its customers , which may be by telephone , face to face or linked by a computer 450 Managing Application Development terminal , it is a great advantage if all of the information about that customer and his dealings with the business can be made available at the point and time of contact so that the customer can be treated as a known individual . This might include a sales and maintenance history for several different types of products , location information , financial status , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , it is also important to have access to pertinent internal information at the same time ? stock availability , schedules for delivery or service etc . Whether the purpose of the contact is to place an order , ask a question or make a complaint , the aim is to improve the value of the dialogue , to the satisfaction of the customer , and essentially to gain competitive advantage . This scenario would entail accessing information about people organisations , locations , products/services , money , scheduled work , stock , distribution and probably more . In order to provide that breadth of information , the level of internal integration must be high , and the information probably based on a business-wide model . It may be stored in relational or object databases . As this demonstrates , strategic systems are often linked to key operational systems , at the external interfaces of the business , exchanging information or sometimes delivering a service or product in their own right . Others may provide the interfaces to improve internal integration . Another category of strategic systems is the executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This type of system needs to be developed quickly , and relies on gaining access to up-to-date information from internal sources or perhaps from external databases . It is then usually packaged so as to deliver its message in a clear , even dramatic , fashion , sophisticated colour graphics being a favourite medium . There are a few good proprietary boardroom system builders available , although several major companies have developed their own and claim very satisfactory results with them . Strategic systems are likely to be complex or will become complex as functions are added incrementally . For example , developing a marketing database from external and internal data , or a " just-in-time " manufacturing system are innovative and quite complex in business and technical terms , if they are new applications to the industry sector . They require considerable business and IS skills for their development and implementation , and both are not entirely within the control of the organisation to effect . They are also required to be developed quickly , and the application may have to be " generated " many times as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user needs and building objects and applications . Speed , flexibility and complexity all lead to problems of controlling the development and then achieving effective maintenance . Strategic Systems 451 New technical and management skills may have to be developed . Continuity in terms of system team members will be critical to keeping that knowledge in an environment that will not encourage accurate documentation , adherence to standards or the best in quality control processes . Those standards should not be ignored , but business expediency will have to overrule technical idealism in many cases , especially if adherence could extend the development time and perhaps miss the business opportunities . The potential implications of this approach should be understood , and some appropriate , if not ideal , development control process put in place . The risk is that problems will occur later that can not easily be rectified . This need would also argue for the use of application generators or computer-assisted systems engineering ( CASE ) tools , where the initial analysis and design can be performed using automated tools , which would then produce code which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly developed and enable changes to be identified and implemented rapidly . The benefits will come from both rapid iterative design and rapid generation of the code ; perhaps two types of generator will be needed . The speed of development of the application is considerably more important than its efficiency of operation . Eventually these applications will probably turn into regular key operational applications , when they may need to be redeveloped in order to make them more efficient in their operation . Even while they are still strategic , some elements of the system can be reimplemented in more efficient code , to meet required performance criteria . Design Characteristics The best design for the majority of strategic systems is probably a well-researched , analysed and structured core , encapsulating the essential business processes and information entities , surrounded by flexible user-driven modules . Alternatively , using object orientation , the basis is the corporate model , and a set of well-designed and scoped objects , linked in an application , fronted with a GUI . Interconnectability , rather than tight integration , may be another goal here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while protecting the installed base of key operational and support systems . Required Skills Due to the nature of these systems , they will be more effectively developed by a small , dedicated project team focusing on delivering business functionality rather than subcontracting any aspect of the project to people whose time is shared with other applications . The team will have to consist of members who have between them high technical ability and considerable business knowledge and expertise . It is vital that the business users fully understand what the system does and , as far as possible , how it does it . As these systems are taking the enterprise into new areas , there will often be a need for new business process or operational skills as well as technology skills . For example , in the use of databases for marketing , advanced statistical analysis techniques would be required . A customer ordering system may require new ways of dealing with customers , e.g. tele-selling . In the area of computer integrated manufacturing , there will be significant changes in the type of machine tools required and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that these business skills are developed . High Potential Systems 453 Software Packages It is unlikely that there will be any software packages available for this type of application . It is difficult to envisage how significant advantage could accrue from a piece of generally available software , unless the business adds considerable value to the package , for example by considerable enhancement , a new use of the package or by changing business practice in an innovative way . In these cases , the process converts the package to a unique application of the package and , as such , it must be supported as if it were tailor-made . Alternatively , a short-lived advantage could accrue from being the first user of a new package ? but success could be very quickly and easily copied , and it could be too high a risk to be the first user of an externally supplied package , which would normally be tried out in the high potential area . Fundamentally , sustained advantage comes from the uniqueness of the application , which others can not easily replicate or improve upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed strategic to the business , and a package could fit the requirement : for example , if the organisation is trying to catch up with competitors or a strategic objective is a major cost reduction , or the business is being severely rationalised , all of which are situations where " preventing disadvantage " is really the target of the strategic system . The principal characteristics of these applications are summarised in Figure 11.2 . HIGH POTENTIAL SYSTEMS These sit in the " R &D"; category , where new technology can be tried out to ascertain its potential for the organisation , or where partially formed user ideas can be prototyped . In this case , it is advantageous to be able to explore the potential of an innovative business idea . An example might be trying out a desktop work flow tool within an evolving redesigned business process . The need is for independent , rapid , low-cost development , which can be abandoned without wasting scarce resources , since risk is high , success far from certain and cost control essential . If proved to be of value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other examples might be : ? A contained pilot using object orientation to create an executive information system ( EIS ) . ? The use of new technology , such as concurrent processing , within a distributed business process , to reduce cycle time . 454 Managing Application Development ? Piloting comprehensive application generator software for producing a prototype of a new application . ? Use of tools new to the business , such as knowledge-based technology , computer-aided design ( CAD ) or advanced management support software , as potential solutions to application requirements . Speed and access to sophisticated development facilities are more important than detailed definition and efficiency , since at this stage user requirements can not be precise or detailed . Integration and data management are rarely considered here , although they may well form essential elements in any emerging target strategic or key operational products following the R &D; process . Systems in this quadrant may be developed by a user or by a user and an IT professional jointly analysing and developing the application . They are often associated with the information resource management ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without jeopardising current systems and can monitor the effectiveness of experimentation . These systems may start as single-user PC developments , which prove themselves as worthy candidates for more widespread use , and thus have to be redeveloped within another portfolio quadrant with the broader production environment in mind . As has been said before , these R &D; type activities should be separated from mainstream systems , to enable them to be evaluated on their merits . The main objective is to evaluate the business potential of applying any technology , but in some cases the potential may not only be where the initial use of a new technology is tried . This may mean splitting the prototyping objectives into those that are application specific and those that are of more general interest . This would be the case , for instance , in the first use of an expert system or new communications technology . Even if an initial attempt fails , the technology should not be rejected totally . Equally , the potential of the technology should not be explored in abstract without some application in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clear terms of reference or objectives should be established at the start , but they may need to be consciously ( and overtly ) modified as knowledge is acquired . There is , of course , a danger that users become so enthusiastic about a prototype that it gets adopted along with all its drawbacks ! Conversely , another great danger is to give the evaluation of new technology solely to technologists . They often have preconceived prejudices , or develop an enthusiasm for the technology without any focus on its business value . A business " product champion " is the best approach to its management , supported by appropriate technical skills . Key Operational Systems 455 Required Skills Often the organisation will have to acquire or develop new technological skills to develop the applications and support the process of evaluation . Some may have to be acquired through the vendor or outside experts . The key to success will be the knowledge transfer that should occur during the evaluation phase . The organisation should avoid future dependency on technical skills only available outside . If this proves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the business case for its deployment is overwhelming . Even then , the development of a suitable capable internal resource must be pursued urgently . While high potential applications need to be evaluated in association with a particular technology , it may be that more than one option exists for evaluation . It can be advisable to carry out parallel , competing R &D; projects focused on one business application , especially if the potential benefits appear very high , if speed is of the essence and/or competitors are carrying out similar evaluations . However , in this case the eventual decision criteria must be clearly spelled out or the process will only leave more uncertainty at the end than there was at the start . Evaluation of new technology is considered again in Chapter 12 . The principal characteristics of these applications are summarised in Figure 11.3 . KEY OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS These are critical to sustaining the current business , and if they fail the business may suffer competitive disadvantage . They are generally the " workhorse " systems , automating the main operational processes of the business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and need to be well-designed , efficient and robust , with a long cost-effective life . Since they often need to be integrated with other primary business process systems , they benefit from adhering to global data management standards , and from complying with an emerging long-term systems and data architecture . They can often be met by well-built application packages or third-party developed software , but this often constrains them from effective integration , resource sharing and data management . Nevertheless , this is frequently the preferred option for a number of reasons . Development resources may not be available , or the record of in-house development may be unsatisfactory , or time may be too short . When developed in-house , they are usually produced using traditional project management and SDLC methods , increasingly automated with CASE tools . Old systems that are showing the debilitating effects of age and years of maintenance could well be candidates for re-engineering or retrofitting . If the organisation has decided to integrate its existing applications and newly acquired applications within an integration strategy , then a major element of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corporate repository , and the subsequent linking of the applications into this . Application Packages The key operational applications of the enterprise will tend to be specific to its particular industry and even to the particular way in which the firm conducts its business . While packages may be available , there will be fewer than for the support systems and they will tend to be more industry specific . For example , there are only a few systems available for retail banking , point-of-sale retailing , hotel reservations or industry specific manufacturing requirements planning etc . Since integration is a vital issue in key operational systems , the data structures and functions provided by the package should be consistent with the information and application architecture defined by the strategy . If they are not , the Key Operational Systems 457 package should be rejected . Alternatively , a particular core package , e.g. an MRPII package , may be used to provide that core architecture , and other , probably smaller , applications may be designed to integrate with the package architecture . Therefore , it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often bringing in a package is the best way of achieving integration of application requirements among the various departments , who would otherwise attempt to satisfy their own needs without regard to the effects on others . " Making the package work " can often override localised objectives , although if badly managed it could become a target for every department to engineer its failure ! Unlike support type packages , however , a key operational package will probably need considerable IS professional support to ensure that integration and effective operation are achieved . Functional Complexity Key operational applications will tend to be functionally complex , have integrated interfaces and dependencies and will need to satisfy requirements with minimum compromise of the user 's main needs . Even where a package is selected , it may have to be customised , despite the risks involved ? and this will require a thorough technical understanding of how the package works as well as what it does . For example , there are two main suppliers of airline reservation systems in the world , but each airline that has purchased one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the agent or the individual making a booking , as though it is specific to that airline . Whether a system is developed or a package modified , an accurate specification of what it does and how it does it will have to be established . A structured logical model of the system must be developed to enable the application to be engineered accurately . That model , documented or . simulated via software engineering tools , plus supporting data dictionaries etc. must be maintained and updated whenever the system changes . Strict change control procedures must be introduced to prevent errors being introduced , which may only manifest themselves in downstream systems . Skills Because this type of system will require ongoing modification in order to avoid falling behind the business needs , there will need to be a high level of technical support skills available for both emergency action and changes . If a package is used it can present considerable difficulties to the organisation when new releases of the underlying application package need to he implemented , i.e. changes may have to be made 458 Managing Application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the complexity and criticality of these systems , it is important that knowledge of the system is not allowed to decay in periods of low rates of change , and control procedures should not be overridden for expediency . For many of these systems , a dedicated support team is required after implementation , consisting of both users and IS professionals . It is important to develop skills related to the specific system , not just employ generalists to correct and amend the system when available . Releases of new versions of the system moved into operation must be carefully controlled and checked after introduction . The principal characteristics of these applications are summarised in Figure 11.4 . SUPPORT SYSTEMS These are invariably found in organisations that have computerised applications , since they largely consist of the legally necessary financial systems , and payroll and personnel records systems . They have a value to the business , but are not critical to its success . If they need replacing or acquiring , the most appropriate solution is to buy in sound standard proprietary packages that meet the business requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interference " . Very rarely can an organisation justify the allocation of valuable skills and resources to developing support systems for themselves . The resources required to implement a package for key operational or support environments are frequently underestimated . Requirements still need to be carefully analysed and documented , and the search and evaluation process undertaken must be linked to the justification , prioritisation and benefit management processes . Even if no tailoring of the package is necessary , there are often interfaces to be built to existing systems , either directly , point-to-point or via an integration framework , and there may be considerable work needed to acquire the system and tailor package parameters , undertake user awareness and training programmes , develop adequate testing material and implement the system . An allowance may also be needed for vendor management relating to supply and service activities . Software Packages Because of the nature of the applications , there are typically many software packages available on the open market to carry them out . Therefore , it should be incumbent on both the user and the IS organisation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these requirements . Even if the " databases " in the packages are not ideally suited to the organisation 's information architecture , integration of data is often less critical than the ability to transfer data . Meeting the task requirement in the overall most efficient way is essential to success , therefore packages should not be ruled out just because they can not be integrated . The user needs are paramount in the final choice , but the IS veto of certain options must be allowed if they can not provide support for the required technical environment , otherwise overhead cost build-up will offset the direct efficiency benefits . Equally , it is best to adopt a low risk or conservative approach , only selecting packages with a well-established base of customers , rather than be the first user of a new package , however good its apparent features . A package selection checklist can easily be drawn up to help users to define requirements and decide on options . 460 Managing Application Development Functional Complexity Although many support systems provide relatively simple local task orientated solutions to specific problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to be computerised in any organisation , often have become very complex or have many interfaces with other systems . However , because these systems have been in existence for a long time , the complexity of the functions and interactions should be well understood . The application systems that can be bought " off the shelf " as packages will contain , usually , the full range of functions to be expected from the application . It is quite unusual for additional functionality to support user requirements needing to be added into the packages before implementation . In fact , modifying a package is a route to problems and high costs . Compromising some needs to the facilities of the package is usually feasible and , since the application is not critical , often desirable . Skills As this type of system is an ideal candidate for an application package , it is not usually necessary to have particularly high levels of technical skills for implementation . Neither is it requisite that a considerable business analytical skill is available , because the functionality required by the business is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are particular skills required that are associated with the problems of implementation of packages . It is necessary to be able to identify those aspects of the business that the package would not support and which require either additional functions around the package , modification of related systems or modification to existing business practices . This may require considerable care by the systems implementors , both technical and users , to ensure that these aspects are not overlooked , and hence benefits foregone or costs increased . Disinvestment These systems , because they are not critical to success , are candidates for disinvestment . There may well be good arguments for subcontracting this kind of system operation to a third party . In Britain , for example , there are a number of third-party suppliers of payroll systems , either to run in-house or on a bureau . Because of the constantly changing tax legislation , this particular type of application becomes very expensive for an organisation to maintain , and outside suppliers provide the benefits of economies of scale , provided the package is extensively used .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
