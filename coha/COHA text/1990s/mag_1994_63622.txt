Sam 's Grand Slam // With a 2-7 record after Sunday 's loss to the Bears , Buc coach Sam Wyche is well on his way to a fourth consecutive double-digit losing season , an unprecedented accomplishment for an NFL coach . ( Seattle 's Tom Flores , with a 3-6 record , is going for four straight , too , but that streak includes his 1987 season at the helm of the Raiders , after which he took a four-year hiatus from coaching . ) Here are the other coaches with three straight seasons of 10 or more losses : // Coach , Team // Years // What Happened Next // Joe Bugel , Cardinals // 1990-92 // Was told he had to win nine games in ' 93 to save his job . Cards went 7-9 , and he was fired . // Dan Henning , Chargers // 1989-91 // Fired after ' 91 season . Later fired as offensive coordinator of Lions . Now coaching at Boston College . // John McKay , Buccaneers // 1976-78 // Went 10-6 in 1979 and took Bucs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' 80 and ' 84 , and 14 in ' 83. // Ray Perkins , Buccaneers // 1987-89 // Went on a six-game losing skid in ' 90 , inspiring JERK THE PERK T-shirts . Was fired on Dec. 3 , thus avoiding ignominious fourth straight double-digit disaster . // Is the Pack Back ? // Packer coach Mike Holmgren was dealt a stunning blow in February when defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes , one of the NFL 's brightest young assistants , resigned and went back to work for the 49ers in San Francisco , where he had coached for 11 years before joining Holmgren in Green Bay in 1992 . Holmgren had every reason to be concerned . In only two seasons Rhodes  --  with considerable help from All-World defensive end Reggie White  --  had hoisted the Packers from 23rd in the NFL in defense to a No. 2 ranking . // An ex-NFL defensive back in his early 40 's , Rhodes related well to the Packer players , hanging out with them after practice , playing dominoes in the locker room . Who could ever fill his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the antithesis of Rhodes  --  a 62-year-old man with 40 years of coaching experience who had never played in the NFL . If Holmgren worried about how his defense would respond to Shurmur , he should n't have . The Packer D is rolling right along . " He 's a father figure , " says strong safety LeRoy Butler . " He does n't want us to give an inch to the opposing team , and he 's never satisfied . You can win a lot of games with that attitude . " // After Sunday 's 38-30 victory over the Lions in Milwaukee , Green Bay is No. 3 in the NFL on defense . The transition to Shurmur has been seamless because he has adapted himself to the Packers , using the terminology introduced by Rhodes rather than forcing his own system on the Packers . // " Fritz coaches the best team defense I 've ever been around , " says Pro Bowl defensive end Sean Jones , who became a star playing for Buddy Ryan in Houston before coming to Green Bay in the off-season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in certain positions , but Fritz makes stars out of the entire defense . If you execute his system , you 'll be O.K. " // Says Shurmur , " Defense in this league is team  --  we and us . Starting with our leader , Reggie , nobody is reaching in , we 're all trying to pour in . Everybody has put his ego in his back pocket . " // Still , even though the 5-4 Packers may be executing as a team , superstars ca n't help but emerge . White , slimmed down by 10 pounds and pain-free because of off-season surgery to remove bone chips in his ankle , is having one of the best seasons of his 10-year career . And Jones has shone , too . He pulverized Lion quarterback Scott Mitchell in the second quarter , knocking him to the ground  --  and out of the game . Mitchell broke his right ( non-throwing ) hand . // Another emerging star is the underrated Bryce Paup , who 's having a Pro Bowl season at outside linebacker . He returned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter . It was Paup 's third interception in two games . And the Packer defense held Barry Sanders , the NFL 's leading rusher , who had been averaging 129 yards per game , to a mere 47 yards and no TDs . // With a comfortable 31-7 lead at half-time and backup quarterback Dave Krieg at the helm for the Lions , the Packers then relaxed a little too much , allowing Krieg to throw for 273 yards in the second half . That cost Green Bay the No. 1 ranking in team defense it had held after eight games . // " A win is a win , " Paup said after the game . " It 's nice to be Number 1 in defense , but that does n't always get you into the playoffs . Winning does . " // Bigger tests await , however . After a meeting with the New York Jets at Lambeau Field this week , the Packers face three straight tough road games  --  in Buffalo on Nov. 20 , in Dallas on Thanksgiving Day and in Detroit on Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , " says Butler . " But we do n't have to worry about anybody . They have to worry about us , especially defensively . " // Out with the New // The injury to Scott Mitchell 's right hand has put his season on ice for a while , and that may prove to be a blessing for the Lions . Detroit went to great and almost laughable lengths over the past 10 weeks to make the $11 million free-agent quarterback look good  --  everything from installing the shotgun and simplifying the play-calling to testing his vision and fitting him with contacts . But according to some NFC Central coaches , what Mitchell really needs is better coaching to correct his horrendous mechanics . Instead of wasting all that time on Mitchell , they say , Lion coach Wayne Fontes should have just bitten the bullet , admitted that Mitchell needed more seasoning and given the starting job to backup Dave Krieg. // Coming off the bench for Mitchell late in the first quarter of Sunday 's loss to Green Bay , the 36-year-old Krieg was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Krieg has n't been a full-time starter since the 1992 season in Kansas City , he displayed the kind of poise that only comes with experience as he directed the Lions to a 23-point second-half comeback that fell just short on the final drive . Krieg was such a confident field general that when the Lions called timeout with 54 seconds remaining , he never went to the sideline for any input . His 273 passing yards in the second half , even if they did come against a lackadaisical Packer defense , are still a Detroit team record for a single half . // " The difference between the two quarterbacks was night and day , " said Lion left tackle Lomas Brown after the game . " Dave 's experience is the difference . He was directing us like an offensive coach on the field . You should 've heard us in the huddle : ' Yeah , we can do this ... we can come back . ' If we had n't made crucial mistakes in the first half Mitchell threw two interceptions , we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lion coaching staff that most of the Detroit players had no idea that Krieg was capable of such heroics . " That 's the amazing thing , " Brown says . " Dave gets two to five snaps with the first string in practice during the week . The rest of the time he 's showing the defense the look of the other quarterback . We really did n't know he could do something like this . He just has n't been given the opportunity . " // Mitchell may be the quarterback of the future , but for now , the 4-5 Lions are probably better off with Krieg at the helm as they try to navigate their way to a playoff berth . // A Very Mild Curry // Tampa Bay 's coaches are so disappointed by the play of defensive end Eric Curry that they sat him down on Sunday , starting Karl Wilson in his place in the Bucs ' 20-6 loss to the Bears . It now looks as if Curry , the sixth pick overall in the 1993 draft , may be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broderick Thomas in ' 89 , Keith McCants in ' 90 and Charles McRae in ' 91 ) . // Curry got off to a promising start in his rookie year , getting five sacks in his first 10 games , but then he sprained his left ankle and missed the rest of the season . So far this year he has n't exactly been the comeback kid . Curry has one sack and 11 tackles in the Bucs ' nine games . He failed to make a single tackle in three games , including Sunday 's , in which he shared time with Wilson , and had only one in three others . // Curry has made a shambles of defensive coordinator Floyd Peters 's 4-2-5 scheme , which relies heavily on pressuring the quarterback . In addition to Curry 's ineffectiveness , defensive tackle Santana Dotson , who was the NFC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1992 , has just one sack and 15 tackles . After Sunday 's loss the Bucs had only eight sacks , which puts them 27th overall in the NFL in that category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , for one thing , they 're questioning his toughness . " When you 're young , the world is your oyster ; everything is happy , and you 're playing good football , " Peters says . " Then all of a sudden , pow , you get hurt . Now you think , This is no fun . Unfortunately , young man , you 're an adult now , and they 're paying you to play in the NFL . You 've got to put on those boots and go shovel a certain amount of  --   --  . " // Even some of Curry 's teammates are questioning his heart . " As my friends and I used to say back home , ' We do n't want to be like the Tin Man , ' " says linebacker Hardy Nickerson . " That Wizard of Oz character had a heart , but he did n't know it . Curry wo n't know it until he decides to let it all hang out on the field and starts studying hard . " Nickerson says that he has gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked the Bucs ' coaches if they would let him play on the defensive line . // " Curry has unlimited potential  --  great size 6 ' 5 " , 270 pounds , phenomenal quickness  --  he could dominate like a Bruce Smith , and he does n't realize it or he does n't know if he wants it , " says Nickerson . " I 've talked to him , and he just gives me an ' O.K. , yeah , yeah , yeah ' kind of answer . It can be turned around . This is not at a point of no return . But either he gets productive , or he 's going to get tired of having his coattail tugged . " // Can the Bears Hold On ? // If you are looking for one key statistic to get a handle on the Bears , try turnovers . According to Geep Chryst , an assistant coach and statistical guru for the Bears , from the time Dave Wannstedt took over as coach in 1993 through Sunday 's 20-6 win over Tampa Bay , the Bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2-3 when they have an equal number and 2-10 when they have more turnovers than their opponents . // Going into Sunday 's game against the Bucs , the Bears were in a two-loss tailspin that featured an alarming rash of turnovers  --  four in their 21-16 setback in Detroit on Oct. 23 , and five in their 33-6 drubbing by Green Bay on Oct. 31 . In the six games before that deluge , Chicago had turned the ball over only five times and was 4-2. // In an effort to stop the avalanche , Wannstedt benched quarterback Erik Kramer for the Buc game in favor of backup Steve Walsh , who had committed only one turnover in his three previous starts . In practice the Bear coaching staff also made it a point to emphasize holding on to the football  --  instructing the defenders to tug at the ball every chance they got and continually shouting " High and tight ! " to ballcarriers . The moves paid off , as the Bears turned the ball over only once on Sunday . // According to Chryst , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injuries to left tackle Andy Heck and . fullback Merril Hoge . " Going into the season , a number of us on the coaching staff joked that with eight new starters on offense , we had more new faces than most high school teams have , " Christ says . " Losing Andy Heck and Merril Hoge has had as much impact on turnovers as the quarterback has . Football is a game of teamwork ; it 's important for all 11 people to come together . Turnovers are prevented when you work together as a unit . " // This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF.
