For those travelers who want to follow their palates around the U.S. this summer , the most delectable roads lead to New York City . Says who ? None less than the country 's leading restaurant critics who participated in MONEY 'S second ranking of the greatest eating-out cities . San Francisco claims the No. 2 spot and Los Angeles is No. 3 . As a service to both business and pleasure travelers , MONEY decided to update our 1990 rankings of the leading restaurant towns in America and offer a guide to today 's top tables . Back then , we saw a surge of cost-be-damned creativity , particularly in the top cities , that seemed too hot not to be cooled by the first ill wind to blow through the economy . Sure enough , the ' 90s roared in , ravaging the restaurant landscape with a prolonged recession . But lately , after a couple of miserable years , the table trade has begun to revive with more energy and imagination than ever . In the process , the leading food cities were gripped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose busy lives constantly sharpen their appetite for restaurant meals , are demanding it . The second trend is what critics call casualization . The setting of the finest food service  --  the tradition  --  steeped formal establishment with headwaiter , captains and extensive menu selection  --  finally fell like a gustatory Bastille . And up rose the bistro , with staff in work shirts and butcher 's aprons , a tight list of offerings and a far friendlier tab . To see how these trends have altered our list of the 15 best eating-out cities , we ranked them once again . The most telling changes : * New York ( No. 2 last time ) has reasserted itself as America 's reigning restaurant town , unseating MONEY 's previous No. 1 city , Los Angeles . What 's more , San Francisco has pushed past its old rival , L.A. , to take over the second slot . * Washington , D.C. , while remaining No. 5 , has improved so dramatically that it joins the elite circle of top cities  --  New York , San Francisco , Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans ( No. 6 , up from No. 8 ) , Miami ( No. 7 , up from No. 11 ) and Houston ( No. 10 , up from No. 13 ) have taken the biggest leaps forward in MONEY 's ranking . Dallas ( No. 15 , down from No. 10 ) and Minneapolis ( off the list , vs . No. 12 last time ) have suffered the steepest drops as they got crowded out by more ambitious competitors . One of the upstarts , Phoenix ( No. 12 ) , makes the lineup for the first time . MONEY 's ranking of the 15 top cities appears on pages 122 and 123 , along with recommended restaurants for a variety of occasions . As in 1990 , the selection and order of the 15 cities are based on quality and variety of food available , local standards of service , and price . To pass responsible judgment on the cities and their restaurants , MONEY turned to the most informed sources available . With the help of Nancy Harmon Jenkins , a respected food writer-editor and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled a roundtable meeting of eight leading restaurant critics . Then we recruited critics in the 15 top cities to pick the best restaurants in their respective towns . Finally , we interviewed 22 experts on the national scene from leading chefs to restaurant consultants who travel and eat out extensively . Then we did some eating of our own . And finally we arrived at our evaluation . The winners : NO 1 : NEW YORK What always made this city the emperor of eating out was its sheer depth and variety . Among its 12,000 full-service restaurants and 25,000 takeouts , you could find more French , Italian , Chinese , seafood , steak places  --  the list never stops  --  than anywhere else . What MONEY found in 1990 was the wrong numbers at the bottom of the tabs plus " rampant mediocrity . " Not anymore . " The city was at the cutting edge of the recession , " recalls Danny Meyer , proprietor of the popular and highly rated Union Square Cafe . Diners began staying home by the thousands . " Since then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by working to please all customers , not just the favored few . The latest Zagat survey , which polls diners in 35 cities and publishes the results in its familiar red volumes , chronicles the turnaround . In 1992 the surest sign of restaurant vitality surged in New York : 145 noteworthy openings vs. only 45 closings . A year earlier the score had been 110 openings vs. 57 closings . What 's more , the average cost per meal actually fell 2.7% in the year . Tim Zagat , co-publisher of the survey with his wife Nina , found " higher food quality , friendlier service and even larger portions than in the ' 80s . " Best advice for the visitor to this dizzying feast is to savor the variety that no city on earth can match . " New York 's greatest strength is in French cuisine , " says Vogue 's food critic Jeffrey Steingarten . So while such traditional haute cuisine temples as Lutece and La Cote Basque have lost some of their following , they still are worth the trip , and reservations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The top three recommendations of MONEY 's New York critic , David Rosengarten , are a fine sample of what real depth has to offer : Vong ( East-West trendy : warm sauteed duck fois gras with mango and ginger sauce ) ; Aureole ( American/ French : scallop sandwich with citrus sauce ) ; and Gotham Bar &; Grill ( nouvelle American : towering seafood salad ) . NO. 2 : SAN FRANCISCO Yes , it 's the reigning queen of Chinese cookery , more so than ever since a tide of Hong Kong people and money flooded in since the mid- ' 80s . But San Francisco is so much more  --  the home of the Great American Foodie , the customer so demanding that restaurateurs there are a restless lot . " It 's where overeducated , overqualified people go to live well , " says New York food consultant Clark Wolf . " It 's where I go for ideas . " While San Francisco 's top tier is relatively thin , it offers in abundance what most larger cities lack : a solid-gold center comprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous , luscious food . Six-month-old LuLu , which our San Francisco critic Patricia Unterman nominates as a best bargain , is a case in point . Try anything from LuLu 's wood-fired rotisserie ( the rosemary-scented roast chicken with warm potato and winter lettuce salad , for instance ) , and you 'll get the point . It hardly matters that LuLu 's menu  --  but not its pulsing , town-meeting atmosphere  --  mimicks the Zuni Cafe , a 13-year veteran of the San Francisco scene and perhaps the town 's most beloved restaurant . Even when you venture to this city 's tonier tables , you 're likely to receive a warm and professional welcome . Stars , for instance , gives off some of the most positive vibes of any world-class restaurant . By the way , if you have trouble choosing from Stars ' lengthy menu , go for the grilled double pork chop : It raises the category of chop to a new top . NO. 3 : LOS ANGELES What made the City of Angels MONEY 's restaurant heaven three years ago was a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New York , who brought a classical order to a roiling ocean of immigration from Latin America and Asia . What precipitated its stumble was the near depression in Southern California 's economy , which not only killed some of the area 's brightest restaurant start-ups but knocked the daring out of the chefs who remained . The result : Instead of innovation , " we 're getting a lot of copycat restaurants here lately , " says Ruth Reichl , food editor and chief restaurant critic of the Los Angeles Times and soon-to-be chief restaurant critic at the New York Times . What remains can still easily dazzle an Easterner or Midwesterner who thinks his or her town is a shining redoubt of Asian eateries . " L.A. is still first in Far Eastern ethnic restaurants , " says Reichl . That begins with Japanese , where L.A. reigns supreme , and includes Thai , Chinese , Korean and Vietnamese . Where else will you find anything quite like Matsuhisa , a Japanese-Peruvian spot that has drawn top billing in the local Zagat Guide for four years running ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , where a sushi feast of the rarest ingredients can run as high as $350 per person ? If you dote on French and Italian classics , however , you may not be satisfied eating in the handful of first-rate places in L.A. ( " You can hardly get a great European meal there , " says Jeffrey Steingarten ) . But who ever said that this city was into tradition anyway ? Go instead for **25;289;TOOLONG at Campanile or Californian/French at Rockenwagner 's or Patina . In fact , Clark Wolf says that Patina , under Chef Joachim Splichal , is the best restaurant in America . Other critics agree with him . So try the roast lamb and eggplant sandwich and anything with potatoes ; then judge for yourself . NO 4 : CHICAGO If lithe L.A. ties down the salady end of the U.S. food scene , brawny Chicago speaks up for the steak and the stew . Some of the best such fare is at Euro-ethnic spots : Lutnia ( Polish ) , Bohemian Crystal ( Czech ) and Kenessey 's Wine Cellar ( Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer and more ambitious places , led impressively by the 31 restaurants owned and run by Richard Melman , who is considered by leading critics as the unrivaled genius among American restaurateurs . His flagship : nouvelle French Ambria , followed by such dizzyingly varied dazzlers as Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba ! ( Spanish ) , Papagus ( Greek ) and Maggiano 's ( Italian ) . Topolobampo serves " simply the best Mexican food in the U.S. , " says restaurant consultant Michael Whiteman . And Charlie Trotter 's French-accented American cuisine is " worth getting on a plane for , " say Whiteman , who lives 800 miles away in New York City . NO 5 : WASHINGTON , D.C. Could the Democrats be the party of the foodies ? Just as the nation 's capital took its first leap to serious eating out during the Kennedy Administration , it is taking another , far more ambitious one under Bill Clinton . The ferment is palpable : At least two dozen major new restaurants made their debut last year . Among the veterans , Jean-Louis ' French and Galileo 's northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both on MONEY 's top-restaurant list for the second time . The hottest spot : Red Sage , an extravagant outpost of southwestern food where you might have to wait a month for a table . Latest charmer : the French-accented Citronelle , one of three offshoots of Los Angeles ' Citrus . Telephone a week ahead , even for a midweek booking . It does n't help that Attorney General Janet Reno dined at Citronelle with Barbra Streisand recently . NOS. 6 TO 16 : THE REIGNING REGIONALS New Orleans ( No. 6 ) is making a heroic comeback , indicated by its rise from No. 8 in 1990 . It has n't yet regained its former glory as one of the country 's great eating-out towns . However , its Cajun and Creole cuisines are being updated , lightened and opened to Asian and European influences at such standouts as Emeril 's , Mike 's on the Avenue and Bacco , the latest entry of Ella Brennan 's clan the reigning American restaurant dynasty . Miami ( No. 7 ) has made an even more impressive move from No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking , this city has become a second home to many moneyed young New Yorkers , particularly in the fashion game . Even Madonna has bought a house there . As everywhere , food follows money . Aside from great Cuban fare , fish  --  snapper , pompano , wahoo , spiny lobster  --  is the local pride . At the top end , Brasserie Le Coze is the Miami outpost of New York City 's seafood star , Le Bernardin ; at the bargain end , Big Fish , open only for lunch , offers a real Miami scene : dockhands , downtown lawyers , politicos all digging into the sea fare . Seattle ( No. 8 ) and Boston ( No. 9 ) both have dropped two slots since our earlier ranking . Seattle 's slippage was a technical one : Miami and New Orleans , both hot , just stormed past it . " In Seattle , " says New York Times food critic Bryan Miller , " the quality of materials is so high  --  oysters , salmon , wild mushrooms , berries  --  that in minimally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , however , is suffering the fate of the long recession : notable restaurants closing and nothing coming in to take their place . Among the other cities on our list  --  Houston ( No. 10 ) , Philadelphia ( 11 ) , Phoenix ( 12 ) , Atlanta ( 13 ) , Santa Fe ( 14 ) and Dallas ( 15 )  --  a consensus of our food-critic sources nominated Atlanta as the one most likely to advance in the ranking over the coming years . Meanwhile , a few outsiders are panting to get aboard . In the lead : Honolulu . In fact , if we had counted the state as a whole , such leading critics as Suzanne Hamlin , John Mariani and Mimi Sheraton would happily have placed Hawaii well within MONEY 's fabulous 15 . WHERE THE CRITICS LIKE TO EAT Name 1 ) the finest restaurant in America and 2 ) your personal favorite . When asked by MONEY , here 's how 19 critics and other food experts answered : * New York 's Le Cirque won , with six votes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people watching is excellent . Among he regulars : Jacqueline Onassis , Donald Trump and Henry Kissinger . * Chez Panisse in Berkeley , Calif. came in second : two votes for best , three for favorite . Chef-owner Alice Waters , a founding mother of California cuisine , ranks among the most influential cooks in America today . * Patina in Los Angeles and Jean-Louis in Washington tied for best with two votes each . One each went to Topolobampo in Chicago , Aureole and Lutece in New York , the Ivy in Los Angeles , Galatoire 's in New Orleans , Cafe Annie 's in Houston and Matsuhisa in Los Angeles . * Union Square Cafe in New York , with three votes , tied Le Cirque for the title of favorite ( five critics did n't name one ) . A vote each went to Stars and Zuni in San Francisco , Emeril 's in New Orleans , Citrus in L.A. and the Inn at Little Washington in rural Virginia . <p>                 @ @ @ @
