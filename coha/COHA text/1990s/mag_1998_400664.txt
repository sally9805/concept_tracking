Tune up your senses and turn of the lights for a wild walk on the dark side . // Admit it . You 've lain awake in your tent in the pitch-black darkness , listening to the disembodied howling , cooing , and mournful wailing of night creatures , and gotten that gun-metal taste of fear in your mouth . I know I have and was happy to learn that my fear is n't out of the ordinary . " It 's a perfectly reasonable reaction , " says naturalist Peter Rice , who leads nocturnal hikes in Southern California 's Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area . Reasonable , sure , but it gets in the way of one of the best spectacles in the natural world , the wildlife nightlife . While we humans are safely ensconced in our tents and sleeping bags , the darkness beyond camp is alive with the goings-on of all sorts of mammals , reptiles , amphibians , birds , and insects . Not being nocturnal by nature , we miss one heck of a show . The first step toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fear ) is understanding what 's out there . After 15 years of working nights , Rice has found that a little familiarity can go a long way . " Knowing the area and what kinds of animals live there is really important , " he says . Because these are naturally nocturnal creatures , they 're highly sensitive to their surroundings and can high-tail it before you even know they 're around-unless you calm your nerves and learn how to become part of their landscape . Start by jettisoning the term " night hiking " from your vocabulary , because nothing disrupts nighttime rhythms like a pair of lugged soles thumping along a trail . Learn how to prowl gently and quietly . If the trail is smooth and the evening warm , wear campshoes or go barefoot . Stay low and move slowly to avoid branches that snag clothing , leaves that rustle and gravel scrunching underfoot . The primary strategy for blending in after dark , though , is to stay put . That means you 'll have to pick a prime vantage point before the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but before it gets dark , check the area for animal sign . With some practice and patience , tracks , scat , gnawed leaves and branches , burrows , dens , caves , nests , and game trails are easy to spot . When you find fresh sign , scope out a safe place at least 40 feet away-behind a bush or boulder or tree , perhaps , or maybe in a gully . That 's where you 'll watch from and listen . // Yogi ? Fido ? // After dusk , head back to your viewing spot . Bring mosquito netting ( avoid insect repellent because animals can smell it ) and a sleeping pad to sit on . Wear dark or natural colors , and for best results , rub yourself with a fragrant plant to disguise the human scent that will keep creatures away . Balsam , sagebrush , and honeysuckle are good natural deodorizers . Once you 've settled in , patience is vital and for many people , difficult . That 's because we 've had our psychic clocks subliminally set by the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a half-hour Seinfeld rerun without channel surfing . So how can you expect to sit still , alone , and at night , for 2 hours in the backcountry ? By tuning into the senses you rarely use in your 9-to-5 world . Vision : First , turn off your headlamp and put away the night-vision scope , insists Rice . Most human eyes operate quite well in the dark , although they take time to adapt to it . " You need 15 minutes for the pupils to open up , and another 45 minutes to develop your night vision . After that , you 'd be amazed at how much you can see . In fact , people can see about as well as cats . " Next , cover the lens of your lamp with a piece of red plastic . You 'll still have enough light to walk or write by , and you 'll be able to spot animals without startling them . Most nocturnal creatures eyes are full of light-sensitive rods that enable them to see in dim light , but lack color-sensitive cones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give away their position bv reflecting light from their eyes back at you . You can identify many critters by the color of their eyeshine . Tiny , glowing , red-orange dots on a tree trunk might belong to a moth , while larger , fiery-white eyes could be a coyote . In bodies of water , opalescent green gives away bullfrogs . ( For other examples , see " Guess Who ? " page 44 . ) Movement is another clue . Big and little brown bats , both found throughout most of North America , have surprisingly different flight paths . The flick of a tail is another sure sign of an animal lurking nearby . Hearing : For many animals , the ears take over when the sun goes down . Owls , for example , can hunt in complete darkness thanks to two unique adaptations : a dish-shaped feather arrangement that funnels sound to their ears , and asymmetrical ear slits-one is higher on their heads than the other-that help them zoom in on a sound , such as a scurrying mouse . You can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On your next daylight hike , pause , close your eyes , and try to separate each sound . Imagine its source . Rice advises taking a hint from mule deer . Cup your hands behind your ears with your thumbs pointing up and elbows out to mimic the shape of deer ears . This technique is said to improve hearing as much as 10-fold . It comes in handy when trying to identify the plaintive wail of a screech owl or the spooky , wheezing hiss of a badger . Smell : Unlikely as it may seem , there are a few ways to sharpen your sense of smell . The simplest is to wet the underside of your nose . The theory is that vapor molecules attach themselves to moisture particles , which is why smells are more perceptible on moist nights , Rice explains . You can also get your nose near the ground , where the night wind picks up most scents . In other words , act like a bloodhound . Identifying animals by smell is a challenge . Other than skunks , animal scents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otter , and deer have been described as slightly musky , while beaver , raccoon , bear , and muskrat are simply more musky . Even the odors of water snakes and garter snakes have been compared to skunks . Basically , if you catch a whiff of something musky , look around at the habitat and see if you can spot more clues like tracks or scat . Once you perfect the art of reading the night , you 'll be amazed at how much you " see " in the darkness . You 'll also rest easier , comforted by the knowledge that you can now identify all those sounds that used to weaken your bladder and trigger the impulse to make a mad dash for the car .
