The author presents the perspective of a superintendent who has contracted with AASA for curriculum audits in two school districts . Suggestions for school districts implementing audit recommendations are offered . Specific steps are outlined , including conducting a feasibility analysis ; assigning responsibilities for planning , and establishing budgetary guidelines . <p> One of the best assessment tools available to local school boards and school administrators is the Curriculum Audit , a program that was developed by Dr. Fenwick English in cooperation with the American Association of School Administrators . The Curriculum Audit approach to evaluating local schools has some unique advantages that are not characteristic of most other assessment procedures . <p> First , the audit is conducted by a team of educators who are highly capable and who have a wealth of experiences . The quality of the auditors not only assures valid observations but it also establishes a firm climate of credibility among staff , board members , and the community at large . <p> Second , the audit is conducted by educators who have little , if any , previous knowledge about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education program eliminates biases and results in recommendations that are based on factual information and professional judgements . In my experience with the Curriculum Audit in two school districts , the audits have been conducted without even a hint of political or staff pressure . <p> Finally , the audit report is limited to what needs to be fixed rather than how to fix it . The responsibility for planning and implementing the recommendations of the audit , therefore , rests with local school personnel and their policy and support groups . Implicit in the Curriculum Audit process is the principle of local accountability for both process and results . Outside consultants identify needs and make general recommendations for improvement ; the schools evaluate the recommendations , then plan and implement improvement strategies for those recommendations they judge to have merit . Purpose <p> The purpose of this paper is to present some suggestions that might be useful to school districts as they strive to implement recommendations which result from a formal Curriculum Audit . The suggestions that follow are based on my experience with Curriculum Audits in two North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved all schools and all grade levels , and the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools in 1991 , which involved the high schools , grades 9-12 . Emphasis will be placed on discussing implementation practices that proved to be effective in the two districts . The nature and types of the audit recommendations and the extent to which the recommendations have been implemented in the Winston-SalemlForsyth County Schools are also presented to illustrate , in part , that recommendations from the audit are both reasonable and attainable . Recommended Principles and Procedures for implementing Audit Recommendations <p> The principles and procedures for implementing audit recommendations that follow will not differ greatly from principles and procedures that should be applied in implementing most sets of recommendations in elementary and secondary education . They are basic , nevertheless , and if ignored , or even compromised , little positive change will occur as a result of the Curriculum Audit . Involvement <p> As previously mentioned , the responsibility for appraising the schools and making improvement recommendations rests with external consultants ; the responsibility for implementing the recommendations rests with local school personnel and their support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leaders in both the Durham County Schools and Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools depended heavily on subcommittees that were composed of parents , students , teachers , administrators , and business representatives . Each subcommittee was charged with the task of reacting to a particular audit issue that was identified by the external audit team . <p> The reactions generally assisted in determining the feasibility of recommendations , the basic steps that should be followed in implementing the recommendations , and the urgency or priority rating that should be assigned to the recommendations . The role of subcommittees in the implementation process was to react to recommendations , suggest general improvement steps or strategies , and indicate urgency of the identified issue or problem . The subcommittees were not charged with developing detailed plans or implementing strategies which should , without question , be assigned to professional educators . <p> Subcommittees were formed after the audit teams identified issues and made recommendations . For each major issue , a subcommittee was appointed . Identified issues and recommendations will most likely have some commonality from district to district , but unique issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations for high schools in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County , for example , were different from those for high schools in Durham County . Determining Feasibility of Implementing Recommendations <p> A critical step in implementing the recommendations of a Curriculum Audit centers around conducting a feasibility analysis . This basically includes the process of determining whether the implementation would be profitable in terms of cost , time , and results . Although members of the external audit team are authorities on educational problems , they are not always fully aware of local barriers and conditions . To illustrate when local school personnel should question recommendations of external auditors , consider the recommendation that Winston-Salem/Forsyth County high school teachers should construct currently available end-ofcourse test banks . The implementation of this recommendation in this particular school system was impractical , if not impossible . The recommendation was ill advised because the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools lacked the leadership , the trained personnel , and the funds to implement the recommendation . This particular task would have been far more appropriate for the state or region where talents , as well as financial resources , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation from the external audit team , provides appropriate guidelines , and suggests general strategies , planning and implementation responsibilities should be assigned to staff . Members of the subcommittee and others should be used as resources . The components of the staff 's plan would include formulating goals and objectives , selecting strategies , assigning task responsibilities and timelines , designing evaluation procedures , and developing a cost-effective budget . Budgets and Evaluations <p> We have learned through experience that the two weakest components in an improvement plan are the failure to budget enough funds to bring about desired change and the failure to design an evaluation for determining whether the audit outcomes recommended by the audit team were achieved . When funds are needed to implement a recommendation , money should be provided or the implementation project should be delayed until funds become available . Staff should not be held accountable for results unless they are provided with the resources to implement a project effectively . Furthermore , no comprehensive improvement plan should be approved and implemented without a well-conceived evaluation design . The design should provide for monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining whether established project goals are attained . Thorough knowledge of the impact that the implementation of an audit makes on a school district must be a major goal of school districts considering a Curriculum Audit . Implementation Track Record <p> Because of commitments of school boards , staffs , and community members , the majority of the recommendations made by the Curriculum Audit teams were implemented in the Durham County Schools and Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools . A few of the recommendations that did not meet a school district 's implementation feasibility criteria were not included in the implementation plans . <p> Recommendations for improvement made by the visiting audit team from the high schools in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County centered around : The high school tracking/leveling system ; Reduction in course offerings ; Curriculum monitoring ; Curriculum guides ; Compliance with the regulations of special education ; Teacher input on budget development in conjunction with site-based management ; Use of the career center ; Equity analysis of the " Adopt-A-School program ; " and Refinement and revisions of job descriptions to eliminate duplication and establish an accountability system . Summary <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools have had in implementing the recommendations made through the use of the Curriculum Audit can be attributed primarily to six factors : First , and most important , there was a strong commitment on the part of the boards of education and the superintendent to conduct an audit ; The feasibility of implementing the audit team 's recommendations was established ; Comprehensive plans were developed to implement each recommendation ; Resources were allotted to carry out plans ) Improvement project efforts were evaluated ; and , Successes in implementing recommendations were recognized and celebrated . <p> By LARRY D.
