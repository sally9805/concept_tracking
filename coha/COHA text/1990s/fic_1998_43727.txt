You Wo n't Take Me Alive ! ( Without at Least Ten Percent of the Box Office Gross ) <p> ROMANCE writer 's two-year flight from justice ended in a style befitting one of her novels this week , when law enforcement agents knocked on her door at a low-budget motel just outside Los Angeles . Rather than surrender without a struggle , Barbara Joslyn stabbed herself in the chest . " As Federal agents closed in on her ... Ms. Joslyn barricaded herself in her cramped motel room and shouted that she " would not be taken alive . " " - The New York Times , May 5 , 1997 . " Let me through , I 'm from the SFWA . " As soon as the hard-eyed , big- shouldered young cop - standing intimidatingly with folded arms on the crowd side of the yellow police tape - heard those words , he gave me a deferential nod , lifted up the plastic ribbon , and ushered me under . Even this rookie plainly knew who had saved the asses of his buddies in countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiors did too . Once on the far side of the barrier , walkie-talkies crackling practically in my ears , I found myself in the middle of a barely controlled mob . Plainclothes detectives , armored SWAT snipers , squat HAZMAT robots , reporters , priests , psychologists , editors , agents , publicists , film directors - the usual mix of do-gooders and vultures you always find at this kind of tragic scene . Using perceptions and intuitions honed from dozens of equally chaotic past confrontations , I zeroed in on the guy most likely in charge : a smartly coiffed City Hall type wearing a suit that probably cost as much as I made in a month . I waved my open wallet , credentials showing , under his nose . " Dorsey Kazin , SFWA Griefcom . Whadda we got here ? " Maybe it was the sight of the understatedly famous silver rocket next to my name in gold-leaf , maybe it was the calm assurance in my voice . Maybe it was the chance to dump this whole mess in somebody else 's lap . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapsed faster than the Wizards of the Coast publishing program , and he spilled his fears into my tender ear like a kid telling his mother what he did that day in second grade . " Am I glad to see you , Mr. Kazin ! Ruben Spinelost here , assistant to Mayor Whiffle . " I tendered the guy a perfunctory shake . " Afraid I 'm in a little over my head in this dustup . Never dealt with one of these new-fangled hostage-based contract negotiations before . " I cut him off . " Get used to it , Rube , this new tactic 's all the rage - and I do mean rage . Brief me quick now , before our gun-toting Gernsbackian decides to lay a few of his more violent cards on the table-or maybe his hostage 's ear . " Spinelost consulted a paper . " Well , the writer involved is someone named Theodolite Sangborn . He 's published - " " Not necessary . I got everything I need to know about him along those lines out of his SFWA file . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from his formative childhood traumas down to how he deducted his mistress 's hotel room as a convention expense on his last 1040 . Not to mention his entire miserable midlist genre career . What I need from you is some idea of the kinds of demands he 's making , and who he 's got in there . " Spinelost used his cheat notes to answer the last question first . " He 's holding his editor , a woman named Sherri Drysack . Ex-editor , I should say . Apparently she made the mistake of deciding to pay him a visit in person to offer her condolences- " " On Bollix Books dropping Sangbom like a squirming roach when his last novel stiffed . What a damn fool ! Did n't she know her presence would be like holding a lit match to a powder-keg ? " " Obviously not . I believe she 's , um , fresh out of Bennington . Fine school , of course , but .... Anyway , now Sangborn is using the leverage represented by her peril to demand a new three-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softcover editions . Oh yes , he also wants Leapsgerb Studios to option his last book for a cool million . " I cursed eloquently . " These Heinlein wannabes with their delusions of canonical stature make me sick . They should consider themselves lucky to get a Whelan cover , like Sangborn did on his Interstellar UPS . never mind options and kick-in clauses . And it always falls to Griefcom to hand them a reality check . " Spinelost coughed politely . " Speaking of checks .... " " Do n't get your boxers in a twist over nothing Rube . Assuming I can bring this whole debacle to a safe conclusion mutally agreeable to all parties , the city will be fully compensated for any extraordinary expenses - as long as no charges are pressed against our author , of course . Whichever publisher picks up Sangborn will cut a check to the municipality tomorrow-and probably make a nice little donation to the FOP . It 's standard industry practice now . They just write it off as a line item on the author 's royalty statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days - " Just then a bullet zipped by over our heads like something out of Harrison 's Deathworld . Spinelost and the other suits fell to the ground , while the rest of us hardened campaigners just groaned cynically at the requisite touch of melodrama . From the innocent-looking suburban house where Sangborn was holed up came a shouted threat . " Hey , people ! I want to see some goddamn action here , maybe a cover proof or a multi-city book- tour itinerary , and fast ! Or Little Miss Blue Pencil is going to have a new buttonhole in her Donna Karan jacket ! " I patted my coat pocket to make sure my cell-phone and palmtop with speed-dialer attachment were there , then grabbed a loud-hailer from a gape-mouthed social-worker . " Sangborn ! It 's Dorsey Kazin ! I 'm coming in for some face time . Do n't shoot anymore , or these guys will put you on the remainder table faster than you can say Robert James Waller ! " Silence for a moment , before Sangbom answered . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ! " Handing back the hailer , I marched forward , the mob of officials falling aside respectfully to let me through . The time spent crossing that inevitable empty and unnaturally silent street to the writer 's house is always unnerving , no matter how often you 've done it before . Sure , you figure they 're not gon na do anything crazy at this point , with a solution to their problems so close , but you never know for certain . I still broke out into a sweat when I remembered how my onetime partner , Alyx Jorus , had gone permanently out of print , drilled through the heart as she approached a writer involved in that hellacious work- for-hire Star Wars novelizations snafu . There are some cases I would n't touch with a ten-lightyear pole . As I crossed to Sangborn 's bungalow , I tried to reassure myself by thinking of all my peers who were even now successfully and routinely doing my same job across this nation of belligerent , mad-dog writers . Those various Griefcom professionals from all the sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , the romance writers , the western writers , the horror writers , the screen- and teleplay writers , even PEN - they all stood invisibly shoulder-to-shoulder with me as I strode up to Sangborn 's door . So bolstering was my ghostly crew that when I got there I was able to knock with confidence , call my name , then enter . A disheveled Sangbom sat on the couch in the darkened livingroom , semi-automatic rifle loosely gripped . ( SFWA sold armaments through the Forum now , and had coffers overflowing with cash . His hair was as messy as a sheaf of manuscript pages dropped in a wastebasket , his face was stubbled , and he was sweating like one of Fabio 's fans getting an autograph . Perched insouciantly on the edge of a coffee-table , Sherri Drysack was , by contrast , cool as one of Anne Rice 's vampires . Tucking long hair behind one perfect ear , she said , " It 's about time you got here , Kazin . My Dayrunner 's showing two appointments and a meeting later this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get these negotiations moving , or are we still in like the Stone Age ? " " Sangborn did n't kipnap you , did he ? You 're in collusion with him . " " Duh , Earth to Kazin , Earth to Kazin : wake up and smell your double-latte ! Of course I 'm in this with him . I was planning to jump ship at Bollix all the while , and Sangborn is my meal-ticket out . " I looked at the pitiful hulk on the couch . Shoeless , his hands shaking , his eyes redder than Mars before Robinson got his mitts on it , he looked the most unlikely prospect for success I had ever seen . " You must have an ace in the hole . What is it ? " Drysack whipped a manuscript out of her briefcase . " Thought you 'd never ask , Razin . Here 's three chapters and an outline for an openended series that 's going to take the sf world by storm . Sangborn 's going to make Niven and Pournelle look like Hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers from her and started reading . After a while , I let out a genuine whistle of astonishment . " Looks like the real thing . A postmodern space opera based on an amalgam of Wuthering Heights and lane Eyre . Did n't think the old hack had it in him . " Drysack moved to sit beside her property , draping a possessive arm around his shoulder . She slitheringly crossed one Victoria 's Secret-sheathed leg over the other . Sangbom let out a plaintive mew like a Hurkle . " Oh , Theo 's far from washed up . He has a lot of good years left in him . All he needs is some tender loving care from the right editor - and of course some fat residuals on any TV series based on the Bronteverse . " I dug out my cell phone and palmtop and summoned up a list of publishers in a screen window . Having picked a likely candidate , I mated the speed-dialer and phone . While the connection was being made , I moved to one of the windows , pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cops . As they began to move in , I saw one of the figures in the crowd answer his own ringing cell-phone . " Loomis Harmonica here . Is that you , Kazin ? " " Damn right . And I 'm sitting on the hottest concept to hit sf since Asimov read Gibbon . Is the publisher of Mary Kay Books interested ? " " You bet your bottom Imperial credit we are . Put Dtysack right on . " I passed the phone to the eager lady editor , then walked across the room to a shelf of liquor bottles . I poured myself an undiluted vodka , and knocked back half of it . Hell of a way to earn a paycheck . But when the Muse calls , you got ta answer . Especially if she 's packing heat .
