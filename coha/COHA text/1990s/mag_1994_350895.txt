In an indirect way , Phillip Reisterer and Tom Kwidzinski have been working hard to pass Bill Clinton 's health-care plan . The two Chicago men were campaigning last week for Dan Rostenkowski in the Democratic primary next Tuesday in the state 's Fifth Congressional District . At one house , a portly woman in a Chicago Bears sweatshirt answered the door . " You 'll read some stuff in the papers , " said Kwidzinski . " Keep an open mind . Rostenkowski brings a lot to Chicago . " She nodded . Upstairs a door opened , and her father , who will be casting an absentee ballot because of some amputated toes , bellowed his loyalty : " Rostenkowski ! " <P> It is a cry to warm Bill Clinton 's heart . The House Ways and Means Committee chairman helped pass the President 's budget bill and could be a locomotive force behind the health-care plan . His role is so important that last week Clinton joined the ranks of Chicagoans such as Reisterer and Kwidzinski , paying an enthusiastic morning visit in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its price . Presidents normally hate to take sides in primaries . And Attorney General Janet Reno answered with only a curt yes when asked whether she had an opinion about the propriety of Clinton stumping for a man under investigation by a U.S. Attorney for allegedly embezzling $22,000 from the House post office and hiring no-show employees  --  the " stuff in the papers . " If it were not for the investigation , Rostenkowski , an 18-term winner , would not need the President 's help in the first place . <P> Still , Clinton went . He seems genuinely to like Rostenkowski . And the President realizes that to prevent Democratic defections on health care , he must establish that he is a man who pays his debts . In the days following the Chicago trip , the Hill took notice . Said a House Democratic leadership source : " It says a lot about Clinton , and it will help him up here , that this is a guy who goes to bat for his friends . " <P> Clinton may also have the satisfaction of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of Rostenkowski . He will probably capture his traditional working-class base , people who well remember the billions of dollars ' worth of jobs he has brought Chicago . The battle is for the remaining souls : the disenchanted middle class and the indignant liberals put off by the investigation . A Chicago Tribune poll taken before Clinton 's visit gave Rostenkowski 24% , but 35% were undecided . Nipping at Rostenkowski 's heels is state senator John Cullerton . <P> Even if the old pol does lose the election , he would not step down until January . But he might still be the lamest of ducks , trying to use 36 years ' worth of connections and favors to have his way one last time . Rostenkowski seems game , whatever happens . Of the health plan , he says , " I think we 're going to produce a bill by September . " He adds : " I 'd rather go out with a bill on the floor and lose it than just bag it . " Spoken like a man who knows how to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
