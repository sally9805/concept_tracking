<p> Luke Cresswell leaned forward , his lithe hands resting on his knees , eyes peering across the top of a butcher-block table while a member of his crew beat out a rhythm with a knife and a meat cleaver . Mr. Cresswell shook his head . Not quite right . He suggested they try contrasting the sharp smacks with the rasp of the blades scraping across the hard wood . <p> " You know : give me a wham , wham , wham , swoosh , wham , wham , wham , swoosh , " he said , cocking his head and listening intently . <p> " Lovely , " he declared , and quickly moved on to the next performer , a young man in a chef 's hat preparing to bang on pots with a wooden spoon . Nearby , workers were laying out a buffet of onions , carrots , cabbage and squash that would soon be rhythmically julienned by the " Stomp " performers . <p> " Stomp , " a mixture of dance , percussion and visual comedy , has been playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two national touring companies , a European company , several television commercials , an Oscar-nominated short film and numerous imitators . Now it had taken over the industrial-looking kitchen at Elks Lodge 878 on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst , Queens . <p> Mr. Cresswell and his partner , Steve McNicholas , the British creators of " Stomp , " were overseeing the filming of a still-unnamed " Stomp " television special that is to be shown on HBO in December , characterized , as are all " Stomp " productions , by the way music is drawn from everyday objects . <p> " Stomp " began as a troupe of eight buskers ( four percussionists , three actors and one dancer ) working the angles on street corners and at festivals all over Europe . Gradually , it evolved into a series of routines that could be performed by interchangeable touring companies , about half-British and half-American , with a smattering of performers from other countries . <p> " It began as a group ; then it became a show , " Mr. McNicholas said . " Now , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Requests for appearances arrive daily . ( While shooting at the Elks Lodge , the performers received a fax asking " Stomp " to appear at the inauguration of Indonesia 's cellular phone network , which they declined . ) Corporations ask them to perform at stockholder meetings and company galas . ( " We tend not to do corporates , because you do n't have any real control , " Mr. McNicholas said . ) Magazines want them to do photo spreads . ( Several " Stomp " performers , including Mr. Cresswell , were to be photographed for a women 's magazine doing a feature on foot cream . ) This fall , they will even appear in a new mathematics textbook , their percussion routines used to illustrate the meaning of fractions . <p> " Stomp , " they said , has been transformed into something else . <p> " It 's a monster , " Mr. Cresswell said . ' Responsibility To Stay With It ' <p> He and Mr. McNicholas find themselves , in some ways , snared by their creation . They wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Showtime earlier this year , and would like to do more movie soundtracks . But they have no time , they said . Besides , they do n't want to give up on " Stomp " until they get a full-length movie made , their next goal . And even then , they feel honor bound to the several dozen performers who are appearing in " Stomp " companies all over the world . <p> " We 're kind of trapped , because we do n't feel we can walk away from it , " Mr. McNicholas said . " We have a responsibility to stay with it and stick with it . " <p> All of which is not to imply that " Stomp " has been anything but lucrative for the partners . In the early years they were compelled to take corporate and commercial work to build the troupe , but now they are in a financial position to turn down virtually all such requests . The touring companies and the New York show are all playing to near-capacity houses , and " Stomp " continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men have worked together for almost 17 years , though on the surface they appear quite different . Mr. McNicholas , 41 , is round-faced and effusive , quick to laugh . Mr. Cresswell , 33 , is dancer-thin and acerbic , drumming his fingers almost constantly as he talks . <p> Mr. Cresswell was a drummer in rock bands in Brighton , England , when he met Mr. McNicholas , a member of several small theater groups , in 1981 . They formed Pookiesnackenburger , a group of street performers mixing music with comedy bits , bound together by Mr. Cresswell 's percussion as he pounded away on lampposts , bicycles , garbage cans  --  whatever happened to be around . <p> " We were always trying new things , banging on new objects , trying new bits , " Mr. Cresswell said . " You never knew until you tried it out for a while . Sometimes , it was just a gimmick . Sometimes , well , it was more than a gimmick , it was a good idea . Then , we kept it .

" Mr. Cresswell said . " And once he 's there for 10 minutes , how do you get him to stay 20 minutes , then get him to stay to the end ? If you do , then that guy is going to give you 5 pounds instead of 10 pence . " <p> Pookiesnackenburger appeared on Channel 4 in Britain , then in a popular series of British commercials for Heineken beer . In 1986 , Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas formed a new company , the Yes/No People , which became an umbrella for a series of endeavors , from outdoor drum concerts organized by Mr. Cresswell to an eight-minute cable television special starring Bette Midler called " Mondo Beyondo " to a new performance group they decided , in 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in their collaboration , Mr. McNicholas did not perform onstage . With " Stomp " he moved off stage as co-director and administrator of the troupe . After its premiere at the Bloomsbury Theater in 1991 , " Stomp " became one of the hits of the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh and began three years of appearances throughout Europe , Asia and Australia . The troupe kept it fresh by experimenting with new routines and allowing performers to improvise a bit and add some of their own personality to the stock characters . It was during this long run that the group was approached to do a sustained Off Broadway run at the Orpheum Theater at Second Avenue and Eighth Street in the East Village . <p> " We never really wanted to do a sit-down , " Mr. Cresswell said . " We just wanted to play good cities . " Sadly Developing A Little Structure <p> But the opportunity was too tempting , Mr. McNicholas said . " Once we 'd been to New York , we knew we had to do it . " To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring while maintaining a continuous run in Manhattan , it had to evolve from a semi-improvisational performance into a set show . <p> A series of routines was put together . The " characters " in the show were referred to by nicknames , unknown to the audience . The role Mr. Cresswell created , the person who is the first to appear onstage and the last to leave , was called Sarge ( " because I used to yell a lot , " he said ) . Others were Mozzi and Potato-head . This allowed them to interchange the players among the troupes ; if there was an injury in Omaha , a spare Mozzi could be flown in from France . <p> With the success of the New York show , members of the " Stomp " cast were asked to perform on talk shows , on sitcoms like " Roseanne " and at awards broadcasts like the 1996 Oscars show . New touring companies were formed . <p> " Let 's see , at the moment we have two touring companies in America , plus the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring company is in Belgium at the moment . And there 's still the old , original company , the eight of us , the old people . We like to use the original group to break into new territories , like we 're going to Mexico and then to China later this year . " <p> To help finance the group 's expansion , " Stomp " appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola , Toyota and Target Stores . " We did it when we felt that the idea behind it was interesting and new for us , " Mr. Cresswell said . In the Coke commercial , for instance , the troupe was seen inside an ice house , whacking away at huge blocks of ice with picks and chisels . <p> The spots spawned imitators performing similar percussion routines in other commercials . " People saw some of these commercials and thought it was us doing them , but really we could n't understand it , " Mr. McNicholas said . " To me , they did n't have the attitude that we put in there . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we try to be deadpan . But they were more cheerful and family oriented . We deliberately do n't play to that kind of Disneyesque family show . " And Even Dialogue Is in Their Future <p> For the last three years , Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas have been working toward a feature-length film that they hope to write and direct . " We have a script , " Mr. Cresswell said . " There will be a narrative , and there will be dialogue . It will be a mix of actors and ' Stomp ' performers put into situations where ' Stomp ' makes sense . In other words , we 'd try to create a world where ' Stomp ' fits in and makes sense . " <p> The 1995 short film " Brooms , " which was nominated for an Oscar , was an initial attempt " to hone our skills , " he said . The HBO special that they filmed at various sites in Queens and Brooklyn is another . <p> " With luck , we 'll be able to put a deal together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though previous attempts to strike a deal with movie-studio executives have fallen through . <p> " We 'd meet with them in Hollywood and they 'd say , ' Oh , marvelous , ' " Mr. McNicholas said . <p> Then , Mr. Cresswell said , he and Mr. McNicholas would be asked to rewrite the script to include a love story " and we 'd tell them no . " <p> Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas both have homes in Brighton , though they spend most of their time on the road , dropping in on the touring companies , making deals to move into new territories , trying to get their movie off the ground . For a week in late June , Mr. Cresswell rejoined the New York company , just to keep up his skills and to make sure the production was not losing its freshness . <p> " That 's our biggest fear , that we 'll go and visit it and it 's awful and dusty and the people onstage are just going through the motions , " Mr. Cresswell said . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elks lodge , Mr. Cresswell strode through the industrial kitchen , listening to the sounds made by hanging pots , cleavers , meat saws , the heavy lid of a garbage bin . A crew member filled a series of plastic bags with various kitchen powders ( sugar , salt , flour , baking powder ) , then shook the bags one at a time , listening to the subtle differences in the rasping sound they made . Mr. Cresswell told a young man with a cleaver what he wanted him to do in the scene . <p> " Bang , bang , bang , chop , chop , chop , " he explained . <p> Chart : " STOMP ACROSS THE YEARS " 1981  --  In Brighton , England , Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas form Pookiesnackenburger , a street band . 1984  --  The band gets its first TV exposure in Britain . 1986  --  Mr. Cresswell and Mr. McNicholas form the Yes/No People . 1988  --  They write an 8-minute film featuring Bette Midler. 1991  --  " Stomp makes its debut in Edinburgh . 1994 The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Athens and at the Royal Festival Hall in London , where it breaks a house record set by Frank Sinatra. 1996  --  " Stomp " performs during the Academy Awards show .
