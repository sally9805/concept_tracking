Section : Business The economic downturn is devastating urban America , but not all cities are in trouble <p> The tension in city halls across the country is palpable . A recession looms , and it could hardly come at a worse time for urban America . In the shadows of shimmering new glass skyscrapers lie concrete ghettos that never benefited from the economic expansion of the 1980s . Hospital wards burdened with crack-addicted babies , crime-ridden streets patrolled only by gangs , housing projects crumbling with neglect - all cry out for attention and additional assistance from city government . Unfortunately , in many urban areas no more help can be offered today . Most of America 's largest municipalities are struggling against fierce financial head winds , with yawning budget deficits , eroding tax bases and rising unemployment . One city - Philadelphia - appears to be on the brink of bankruptcy . To endure a recession in the early 1990s , U.S. cities will have to slash much-needed services and squeeze additional tax revenues out of their citizens . <p> Bad times have already rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report by Alphametrics Corporation , 56 of the 75 largest U.S. metropolitan areas - cities and their immediate environs - posted economic declines in the second quarter . Altogether , U.S. municipalities and the states that help fund them began the year with operating deficits totaling more than $30 billion . Those same governments entered 1981 , the first year of the last recession , with a healthy budget surplus . <p> Not all the news on the urban front is doom and gloom . There are a number of cities such as Houston , Minneapolis , Indianapolis and Portland , Oreg. , that have retooled their balance sheets and reinvigorated their economies since the Reagan downturn of the early 1980s . While there is no guarantee these municipalities will escape economic damage this time , their profiles reveal that with conservatively managed budgets and strong , diversified tax bases cities can better withstand the undertow of recession . <p> The municipalities that have been less farsighted - or less fortunate - will find few crutches on which to lean during the impending financial shakeout . The federal government , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of revenues for large cities , now provides less than 5 percent . <p> To make matters worse for hard-hit cities , the financial markets are clearly bearish on many of the nation 's urban economies . Over the past three quarters , Standard &; Poor 's , a bond rater , has downgraded $41.9 billion in municipal debt , nearly four times the volume that it has upgraded . When credit ratings fall , borrowing costs rise . For example , nervous investors recently pushed up yields on New York 's municipal bonds to 8.5 percent , only 0.33 percentage points less than battered Philadelphia 's B-rated debt . Investors fear New York 's swelling budget deficit . <p> In addition to New York and Philadelphia , two other cities - Detroit and Boston - have been adversely affected by the economic slowdown . If a nasty recession moves in , they may not be alone for long . Hard-hit cities : <p> Philadelphia . No other major metropolis faces as much fiscal desperation as Pennsylvania 's largest city . " If they do n't straighten things out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director at Standard &; Poor 's , " they could default " on payments to some of their creditors . After New York took such a drastic step in 1975 , it was shut out of the credit markets for five years . Philadelphia has already become a financial pariah : In September , it went to the bond market but was unable to find any takers for one of its debt issues . The city is currently burdened with $2 billion in bond debt . As a percentage of property value , that is four times the median debt burden of major U.S. cities . Mayor Wilson Goode predicts that Philadelphia could run out of money and shut down in December . <p> The city 's financial debacle is not of its own making , says Sandra Featherman , director of the Center for Public Policy at Temple University . Philadelphia is finding that the Pennsylvania Legislature and the governor are increasingly uninterested in its plight . Harrisburg , for example , refuses to allow the city to raise its tax rates . In addition , Mayor Goode has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit-cutting proposals . With one of the nation 's highest concentrations of poverty , the city will be hurt . And services are already strained to the point that residents complain about uncollected garbage . <p> New York . Big Apple Mayor David Dinkins is struggling to get his city 's budget out of the red before it becomes an unmanageable problem . Last week , he ordered city agencies to prepare for $1 billion in cutbacks . Big-time budget slashing like this wo n't wipe out a deficit for fiscal year 1992 estimated at $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion . Bridging that gap with taxes is unlikely , predicts city Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman , while bridging it with payroll cuts would require " gargantuan " layoffs . <p> New York 's 1990 squeeze stems in part from the financial boom and bust of the 1980s . Between 1977 and 1987 , the city picked up 135,000 jobs worth more than $4 billion in wages in the financial-services sector . This more than compensated for $3.5 billion in wages lost from manufacturing cutbacks . After the 1987 Wall Street crash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to dramatically downsize - and mass layoffs began . Drexel Burnham , for example , let go its entire staff of 5,000 after it filed for bankruptcy . <p> Detroit . The numbers are stark , revealing and even a bit scary : Detroit has lost half of its population since 1950 . The hollowing of the Motor City now threatens its finances . Preliminary 1990 census figures show the population at 970,000 , falling below a million for the first time since the early 1900s . Unless Detroit can prove that the census missed 30,000 residents , the city could lose state aid and certain taxing privileges granted by the state legislature . The total loss could come to $242 million , some 20 percent of the total city budget . <p> In a recession , Detroit could scarcely afford to lose that revenue . With General Motors and Chrysler as the city 's two largest taxpayers , any cyclical downturn will bludgeon the city . In the last recession , unemployment in Detroit reached 20 percent . Manufacturing plays a somewhat smaller role today , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan research economist Don Grimes . <p> Boston . Even diversified Beantown is feeling the chill wind of a regional recession . After four straight years of state aid increases , Massachusetts has trimmed its assistance by more than 8 percent . Larger cuts are sure to come , according to Samuel Tyler , head of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau , especially if state voters pass an antitax referendum that would cut some $2.2 billion from next year 's state budget . Mayor Raymond Flynn has won plaudits for keeping Boston 's budget in line through lower-than-inflation expenditure increases , but actual cuts may soon be required . The deficit for Boston schools recently rose $2.3 million as city managers calculated a 22 percent increase in heating costs this winter . Cities holding on : <p> Minneapolis . Minnesota 's biggest city has transformed itself from a regional manufacturing-trading center into a global information-processing hub for such high-tech firms as Cray Research and Honeywell . While the city lost 9,000 manufacturing jobs during the 1980s , it gained almost double that number of service jobs . Some 80 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's diversity should serve it well during a national downturn . Health care , regarded as recession-resistant , is Minneapolis 's biggest job generator and now surpasses agriculture as the state 's No.1 industry . Minnesota 's farm economy has bounced back from the drought of 1987 . Farm-product sales receipts should total close to $7 billion this year , up from $5.8 billion three years ago . Even if other sectors slump , farm exports , helped by the weak dollar , should remain strong . <p> Though Minneapolis has added to its debt load in recent years , its per capita debt is extremely low : $655 . The city 's budget is in such good shape that its bonds are rated Aaa . This year 's 15 percent budget surplus will help pay for capital projects next year . <p> Indianapolis . This heartland city has burnished its image by becoming the nation 's amateur-sports capital . The 60,000-seat Hoosier Dome , completed in 1984 , has brought legions of fans to the city and resulted in the construction of 30 hotels over the past six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Games , in 1987 , and numerous conventions . In 1984 , the city lured the Colts pro-football team from Baltimore . In 1992 , it will host the U.S. Olympic swim-team trials . <p> Though sports feeds the city 's booming downtown , it is the health-medical and business-services industries that have provided most of the new jobs and offer the most hope for the future . General Motors still employs 16,500 people in the city , but Indianapolis no longer is as dependent on the auto industry as it once was . Autos currently account for just 3.3 percent of local employment . <p> Mayor William Hudnut III , now campaigning to be Indiana 's secretary of state after 14 years in City Hall , has run a tight fiscal ship . When federal aid began to dry up in the 1980s , he imposed a new income tax that now is generating $80 million a year in revenue . The city , which has one of the nation 's lowest urban-poverty rates , puts 5 percent of its money into a trust fund each year to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest metropolis is basking in the sunlight of a comeback from the dark days of the early 1980s . Unemployment in the Portland metro area sank to 4.5 percent last month , the lowest September jobless rate in 20 years . The unemployment figure is even more impressive in view of the continuing influx of new residents flocking to Portland . The population jumped almost 14 percent in the ' 80s . <p> Like Minneapolis , Portland is benefiting from the globalization of the American economy - particularly the trade and investment flows with Japan and other Pacific Rim nations . In the two-year period from 1987 to 1989 , the volume of trade passing through the city 's port expanded by 43 percent as exports of U.S. goods picked up steam . <p> Also , Portland 's growing high-tech industry is being fed by capital from overseas . Since NEC Corporation broke ground for an electronics plant six years ago , 20 other Japanese companies have settled in the Portland area . " It 's hard to imagine what the national economy could throw us that we could n't handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oregon . <p> Portland has a light debt load , $980 per capita , and municipal spending is held strictly to the inflation rate , except for priority needs such as police protection . <p> Houston . The nation 's energy capital stands to benefit from the recent run-up in oil prices . Already , Houston has recovered 77 percent of the 220,000 jobs it lost in the oil-price collapse of 1986 . But while the city 's economy is still fueled by energy , it is much more diversified than it used to be . <p> Most of Houston 's future job growth will come in nonenergy industries , such as electronics , aerospace , health care and biotechnology . M.Ray Perryman , resident economist at Baylor University , expects the Houston economy to outperform the nation 's for the next 20 years . <p> After running a series of budget deficits during the early 1980s , Houston chalked up a $79 million surplus in fiscal year 1989 . The city expects to remain in the black again this year . Houston 's unemployment rate is dropping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DETROIT : <p> Population : 1.04 mil. ; change 1980-88 : *13.9 percent <p> Unemployment rate : 1989 : 11.8 percent ; 1990 : 12.5 percent <p> Poverty rate : 21.9 percent <p> Bond rating : Baa <p> Outstanding debt per capita : $1,378 <p> Budget surplus or deficit : 1990 : *$33 mil. ; 1991 : *$50 mil .
