" ... And since that night the taste of fruit cocktail has always been magical to me , far-off , whatever that means . It was far from everything around . I still get it sometimes . I open a cheap can of the overcooked , overprocessed , overripe fruit and the whiff of gramarye is overwhelming . " <p> He sighed and turned away . We were lying on the chesterfield in his living room , flung out for the occasion into bed-like proportions . We were talking through the thick late summer twilight , no lights , no music , only near street sounds some distance below . " A childhood of privilege , " was all he said . And I could see it through his eyes too but it was wrong , all wrong . And how to begin to excavate the difference from where his head had already settled it ? <p> It had started with idle talk about giving each other Christmas gifts  --  like new lovers , I guess , wavering between no gifts and a bounty . One Christmas he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why now . I was about seven and all I remember is my mother cooking ordinary food and sitting down in the kitchen and crying . Something must have happened but I do n't know what . " He smiled , and I looked into those crinkled brown eyes that must have refused pain over and over until it had no place there any more . Sometimes I thought I had never known anyone so cold . Strange too how much I loved his coldness . <p> Me too , I thought to myself , but did not say it . One Christmas I had got no gifts either . It was odd , my being at my cousins for Christmas . ( Did something happen too ? I do n't know . ) Being there was wonderful and exciting and after tiptoeing into bed we talked for a long time about whether Santa Claus would know that I was away from home . " Do n't worry , " whispered my big cousin Bella , " if he do n't drop it here yuh bong to get it when yuh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard loud singing and music from the kitchen , bottle-and-spoon music and a cuatro , and men 's voices carrying on . Uncle Samuel 's voice was clear , " Bring out the children and leh dem enjoy de Christmas . Bring dem out , " emptying his pockets , " leh mih get rid ah some small change . " <p> Esau slept right through ; nobody could get him to budge . But Sonia and I walked out sleepily and collected our coins . People were singing and drinking and everybody forgot about us . Somebody gave us each a big bowl of fruit cocktail and we sat there eating it . I was on my own . It was Christmas and this was not my house , not my parents , no brothers and sisters nearby , awake at one o'clock in the morning eating fruit cocktail , its blandness not missing anything in the air , breaking all the regular rules of Christmas . <p> Privilege I do n't know . The grocery used to sell tinned fruit and one or two times a year everybody used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds and smells and memories of that night . I do n't really know what happened . A terrible row and a real fight , I think , with a woman screaming , broken glass all over the floor near where a man was playing the cuatro , my aunt 's high-heeled slippers flung into the middle of the pile , the creeping inexorable smell of desolation . Uncle Samuel shouting , getting into his car and driving fiercely away into the darkness . It 's not possible to keep some and leave some behind . I 've kept most of it . It was n't privilege , though . <p> I went back home on Boxing Day and found the others playing with new toys . My parents had wrapped a toothbrush stand with a Mickey Mouse head in used Xmas paper for me . The stand was to be attached to the wall above the sink . There was room for four toothbrushes , one for each child . Santa Claus ? My mother was offhand about it . " He lef yuh out ? He did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she chuckled dryly , " Rudolph must be get confused with all the different directions . Anyhow you know all about Santa Claus . Yuh eh find yuh too big for all a dat now Go outside and play . " <p> Much later I found out that the other presents Santa had brought were really cheap plastic dolls that she had sewn clothes for , night after night , when we were asleep and he was out . The little truck my brother got cost a dollar or two . I was already too big for everything she could make . And she had got nothing from Santa either . Strange , is n't it , that what stops me from telling him about all of this is not the fact of poverty , nor uncertainty , worry or any of those things , but the familiar home-names of everybody  --  Muddie , Da-Da , Papa , Sonia . Just calling those names would be to expose myself completely . It stayed at fruit cocktail privilege . <p> He went to sleep easily , leaving me alone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think of it , is a fabulous Bajan dish made of rice and ochroes , salt meat and saltfish , all cooked-down together . Why did they name it " privilege " ? The time I had it was at a party where everybody brought a one-pot from their own country . Belize had serre , Trinidad had pelau and Barbados had privilege . When Barbados set down the steaming bowl they announced it as a dish fit for a king . That table was a queen 's banquet alright . And it was all poor-people Caribbean food . <p> It 's possible that my only real privilege was chat our house was packed with old books . And that made me a reader of everything : Dr. Chase 's Almanac , Alistair Cooke , my mother 's cookbooks , my father 's pornography . The house had a bookcase with some leather-look volumes , bound copies of the Reader 's Digest condensed series , The Reader 's Digest of course , and big fat nice books written by people like Zola , Marie Corelli , Lloyd C. Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff packed up under the bed in cardboard boxes  --  my father 's school books like Pattern Poetry and The Talisman by Sir Walter Scott , The Rivals , all of Dickens , Thoreau , Ruskin 's Sesame and Lilies , and a few of Shakespeare 's plays . All kinds of treasures were in those boxes . The diary of Anne Frank , for instance . They did n't bother to put those books on the shelves because they were old , mashed up , smelling of cockroach eggs and the occasional mice droppings . And in between the books there was the hunger that came and went with the low , low whine of a mangy dog . The hunger came and stayed although there was never really a day with nothing at all on the table . Something always materialised somehow . It 's like that with some levels of poverty . Want , hunger , always there , while you 're chewing and swallowing : fried aloo and roti , fried ochroes and roti , dasheen bush and roti , or ochroes and rice and a suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation . <p> My grandfather planted them on a narrow strip of land at the side of the house . They grew straight and tall  --  taller than usual maybe because they were half-starved of light  --  their slender stems bending with every stray wind that filtered through " the grove , " and they bore extravagantly . My mother had quarrelled with Papa for digging up the land at the side because she wanted to set down a rock-garden there later when things got better . But she was the first to harvest the ochroes and do unheard-of things with them  --  fried , stirred into cornmeal batter with a whisper of saltfish and made into fritters , dusted in cornmeal and deep-fried . Now that I think of it , cornmeal must have been very cheap then . <p> My father , Da-Da , always left home early and returned late . He hated poor food but Muddie would always heat something up for him late at night when he returned . Although it was late I would awaken and hear their quiet , bitter arguing about money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was a gambler . <p> Once Sonia was staying at our house for a while when her parents were on long-leave in England . When we filled out the forms at school for the Government examination the teacher asked where our fathers worked . Uncle Samuel worked at the Ministry of Agriculture so Sonia wrote " labourer " on her card . My father worked at a big supermarket in the downtown area of San Fernando . He was always counting and parcelling up money and one day I was waiting for him in the office when Mr. Jones dropped in to see him . Jonesie saw him counting out the bills with that swift downward movement that I loved to watch ( I never learnt to do it , not even now ) and exclaimed , " If ah did n't know yuh was a gambling peong I woulda guess by de way yuh handling dem bills . Yuh really should be casa man . " I had heard talk about gambling at home . I wrote " gambler " on my examination card . That day when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and about the coming exams . Their anger at home took us by surprise . Sonia got a good stiff boof . I got a cut-arse . <p> With the gambling job you could either win or lose . So when Da-Da won it was plenty treats and small-change and swiss-rolls and choc-ices and tomato juice . When he lost the hunger started up again . When that happened Muddie would wake up in the morning and make three or four bitter remarks to herself before she set to work to manage the day . She would snip the youngest ochroes from their bushes and serve them lightly steamed with a dot of butter . In front of the house a stand of dasheen had sprung out of the drain . She cut the young leaves of these , mixed them with ochroes and made a bhaji . A little bit of flour for roti and we ate a whole meal . <p> Sometimes the flour itself was scarce . One day there was n't even flour . Our grandfather walked the two miles to the Chinese shop , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenty-pound sack on his head . Papa was too old to work but he had his small government pension . Why did Mr. Chinaleong give him credit ? When we lived in Biche , in the country , Papa was always coming home with burlap bags full of stuff on his head . He would bargain hard at the market for produce left over at the end of the day . When he reached home he would empty the purple bhaigan or ginghee or tomatoes or string-beans with a flourish on the floor of the long front gallery while we rushed out and fought over what he had brought us . There would always be chilibibi , nut-cakes , rice-cakes ( my favourite ) or toolum ( Sonia 's favourite ) mixed up in between the bhaigan and tomatoes . Once he even brought home a bag of cutlass-fish and emptied them , all slithery and sea-black , on the wooden floor . Muddie sighed resignedly , but refused to touch them . Papa gathered them up and cleaned and gutted them . He even roasted some with sweet potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the house . Sonia and I feasted that day . <p> The acres we had left behind in Biche were valueless and beautiful . The wooden house sprawled at the front near the land while behind it , stretching up a hill on one side and down into a ravine at the back was land , lots of it , with trees , a chicken-coop , a duck-pen , a pig-pen and stables from long ago . The avocado tree had low branches swooping to the ground where we rode horse , then there was the forest of ochro bushes where we played cowboy-and-Indian , and the cigarette bushes near where we played shop . <p> It was different in the growing suburb of La Plata , just outside of San Fernando , where Da-Da had built he new concrete house . Everyone lived on small lots of land although some were landscaped cleverly to suggest an imagined spaciousness . Ours was not landscaped  --  YET  --  but my uncles had experimented with some imported grass seed and now our tiny front lawn was covered with devil grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrigerator ; we had neither  --  YET . We borrowed ice from the neighbours because there were no shops or country parlours in La Plata . Auntie Semoy gave us ice some days ; Mr. Collins on others . Once while I waited outside Auntie Semoy 's kitchen and neat living room for the ice , she asked in her friendly way , " How your mother always picking ochro so , eh ? All yuh like ochro , eh ! " She followed this up by asking Muddie who confirmed that we were almost passionate in our taste for ochroes . <p> In La Plata it was not ok to carry a gallon of the pitch oil we used for cooking the long distance on foot from the Chinese shop to our house , while the pitch oil leaked against your legs and the gallon tin dug into the vulnerable area near the back of your knees . Everyone else had gas-stoves and had their gas delivered in huge cylinders . And it was not ok for Papa to walk that same distance with a 20-lb. sack of flour on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cruelly when he heard , " like a old bong-coolie . " Da-Da kept himself out of reach of all of this because his job at the supermarket as a gambler was very important . Everything Da-Da did was ok because he dressed well , spoke well and did his job very well even though he lost sometimes . The day Papa brought home the sack of flour , Muddie made individual sada rotis on her tawa and crushed some garlic and fresh Spanish thyme into a little margarine . She served it up with panache and we ate and ate . <p> I think it was around this time that I swallowed a cookbook . I remember it well  --  it was the Boston Cooking School Book , with a faded buff cover and red lettering . At the front was a column for planning meals , followed by two whole chapters on method . I devoured material on how to bake , broil , saute , shir , braise , roast , how to make puff-pastry and how to identify a variety of fruit and vegetables like turnips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years later . The food on my plate turned into cookbook magic . When Muddie cooked a semi-stew of eggs , saltfish and tomatoes with bake , the food on my plate turned into shirred eggs , braised tomatoes and saltfish souffle . Or plantains dusted with lemon juice and dessicated coconut while one slice of ordinary blackish fried plantain stared at me from behind neatly cut quarters of roti . <p> Times were hard . Muddie got a job in a little store down the street from Woolworth . She and Da-Da worked on the same street but they came and went separately . Da-Da was ashamed of having his wife work , especially as a low-paid storeclerk , so he pretended that she was n't working at all . She pretended she was n't working too so everything in the house was supposed to run as usual . All of the cooking fell on me although I was twelve years old and had to go to school like everybody else . <p> I got tired of cooking the same things over and over . And Muddie had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the cardboard boxes . The first day I made coo-coo with ochroes and cornmeal out of the cookbook I got a terrible boof and nobody would touch it . They said it looked stiff and slimy and that the stewed saltfish was too oily . Late as it was , Muddie had to quickly make up some sada roti and butter for them . It was Da-Da who saved me . His gambling job finished late that night and he came home hungry . He ate and ate and ate . Muddie must have been watching him suspiciously because I heard the hiss in her voice , " Yuh know bout coo-coo ? Where yuh know bout coo-coo ? " I was sill doing home-work on the big table outside and listened attentively . I had heard a neighbour whispering to Muddie that Da-Da had a Creole woman and that it was n't really the gambling job that took up so much time . When he had finished eating , Da-Da called me and gave me a big hug . That was my licence to practise . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had already swallowed a cookbook . Paimie or blue drawers , pastelles , callaloo , and shark-fin soup mixed up with dhal and rice and fried bodi with pigtail , dumplings and stew beef , macaroni pie with stewed dhal and tomato chokha . Pinwheel rolls , chequered cakes , steamed cucumber slices with cheese and lemon , stuffed eggplant au gratin . The day I made kitcheree for Good Friday I was proud , proud . I did n't get that in any cookbook . It was Mousie from the country who came on a visit and told me how to do it . Muddie did n't know too much about real Indian food and there were no cookbooks for that . I added shrimps to Mousie 's recipe and served it up with tomato chokha on the side . <p> One day I noticed that a set of vines had started to run on the wall behind the back steps . In Biche we had endless vines and bush . We used to make wild cucumber chow , suck the bright red seeds of wild carilees , eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . La Plata was boring . The vines on the wall were almost all old bush , I thought , until I saw some bright red color peeping through . It was the tiny wild carilees , finding their way from Biche to La Plata , laden with small firm fruit . Only Papa ate fried carilees because he said they were good for high blood-pressure , cancer and rheumatism . But the only thing we had for dinner that day was rice and dhal so I tore down about two dozen small carilees and curried them with black massala and little red bird peppers . Everybody ate . Some days later I tried my hand at kaloungie because Papa had said , " If yuh could cook massala carilee so good , yuh might even manage kaloungie . " Papa could cook only one thing  --  thin crisp kurma that Sonia called sugar sticks . But he knew what kaloungie looked and tasted like and explained it . Quickly , and disgorging from the insides of my big cookbook , I worked backwards . The first time the kaloungie stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry . But the second time it was perfect , stuffed on the inside , crispy-succulent and slightly burnt on the outside . After that I knew I could cook anything . <p> Muddie never even tried the West Indian cookbook because by this time she had given up on the kitchen . I suppose it was a strange life , me and my mother sharing the kitchen like equals ; she would make breakfast and I would make sandwiches for everybody for lunch . She would go to work and I would have dinner cooked before she came home . Exactly like co-wives . But it was n't strange ; it was just our life . It was n't privilege though . <p> Privilege is the life I lead now . I can do just about anything I like in this city because I earn enough and am my own woman . I do n't like having too much , though . It makes me feel to run out and squander it on the nearest vagrant or on the nearest handy act of vagrancy . I 'm told that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can be unmasked . I could care less . Sometimes I just like to waste . Perhaps it 's just indifference because of old fruit cocktail privilege . <p> Privilege is also my hobby as a designer of cuisine . Word of mouth is how it got started but now I get all kinds of weird and wonderful jobs . I design cuisine to integrate every aspect of a person 's special event so that the table looks like your life quilt laid out as a feast for eyes and palate . Home , childhood , history , nationality , personality , seasonal produce  --  no stops allowed . Depending on the circumstances I charge a fortune or nothing at all . <p> The menu for the party of one of my dearest friends , a Jamaican actress , now famous and hitting the no-holds-barred forties , went like this : <p> APPETIZER <p> Pakoras &; Tamarind Dip <p> Mini Accras &; Hot Bhaudhaniya Sauce <p> SOUP <p> Cream of Tannia with Spinach Puree &; Chopped Coriander <p> ENTREES <p> Jerk Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Arugula &; Water Chestnuts <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VEGETABLES/SIDE DISHES <p> Seasoned Rice <p> Braised Cassava with Tomatoes &; Peppers <p> Anansi Roast Plantain <p> Sauteed Debe Pumpkin <p> Fresh Pomme Cythere Chutney <p> SALAD <p> Avocado Layered Salad <p> DESSERT <p> June Plum Crisp &; Coconut Ice-Cream <p> A tad over the top , I thought . But hen so is my friend  --  feisty and fabulous . <p> I have more requests than I can handle so I pick and choose . The other day one of my wealthy client/acquaintances asked where I was trained . I laughed . " Well , " I said , " when I was twelve years old I went through periods of excruciating hunger . So I swallowed the biggest cookbook I could find . " We both laughed . " No , really , " he insisted . I answered with a straight face , " I received most of my training at the school of Indian Cuisine in La Plata . It was a real privilege to be trained there . " He nodded , satisfied . <p> So privilege it really was , fruit cocktail and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
