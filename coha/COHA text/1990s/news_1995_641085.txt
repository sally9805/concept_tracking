<p> You do n't have to be a rotisserie drone or a card-carrying member of the Society of American Baseball Research to understand the lure of baseball statistics . Just check out a box score over your morning corn flakes once the real major leaguers return . <p> A box score is more than a compilation of statistics . It tells a story in a tiny patch of newsprint . It helps the average fan determine if Don Baylor is stressed out over his bullpen , or if opposing teams are pitching around Ken Griffey Jr . It provides a sense of Greg Maddux 's mastery of the strike zone , and Kenny Lofton 's ability to torment catchers . <p> Box scores , and the numbers they generate , contribute to baseball 's mystique . Chances are the most ardent sports fan ca n't recall how many touchdowns Jim Brown scored , or points Wilt Chamberlain amassed , or goals Gordie Howe accumulated . But he knows Ted Williams hit 521 home runs , Pete Rose collected 4,256 hits , and Bob Gibson compiled a 1.12 earned-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consistent and designed to paint a detailed picture over time . <p> Which leads to a disturbing realization : The longer the strike continues , the more likely major leaguers will be stuck with a second straight year of incomplete statistics . Viewed against the human toll - concession workers losing income and minor leaguers agonizing over being called " scabs " if they play in Cactus or Grapefruit League games - that 's a relatively trifling concern . But from a historical perspective , it 's a direct assault on everything baseball holds dear . <p> If every baseball season is a story , the 1994 installment omitted the final few chapters . And 1995 will miss the prologue and lord knows what else . <p> " The reason people value statistics is that they create a sense of order , " said Bill James , noted author and statistical guru . " Look at guys playing in 1917 or 1935 , and with some exceptions , their numbers look a lot the same . There 's a sense of orderly progression throughout a player 's life that enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart form . <p> " There 's a lot of value to a baseball fan that 's disrupted ( by the strike ) . I do n't know if you would describe it as a wart on the arm of a player 's career , or as something larger . But there 's certainly a disfiguration in the symmetry of a player 's career numbers based on this . " <p> To the people who make their livings crunching baseball numbers , the prospect of nonstriking players playing opening day is n't nearly as distressing as the memory of the owners canceling the World Series for the first time in 90 years . <p> " They call it the championship season , and last year there was no championship , " Tom Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau said . " That blemishes the season more than the cost to any individual 's statistics . You have to keep the big picture in mind . " <p> The prospect of replacements intruding on the record books is , nevertheless , disconcerting . If Oil Can Boyd becomes the first pitcher since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock should be placed in the achievement ? What if a replacement slugger becomes the first player in major-league history to hit five homers in a game ? Fans - not to mention Donald Fehr and the players ' union - have every right to question the integrity of those accomplishments . But they would go in the books , just the same . <p> Ken Samelson , an editor of the Baseball Encyclopedia , said replacement players will be included in the next edition of the book , provided the games in which they appear count in the standings . The latest encyclopedia was 2,857 pages long , and the addition of several hundred newcomers could push it in excess of 3,000 . When Samelson says , " My bosses wo n't be too happy about that , " you can practically feel his temples pounding at the Macmillan Publishing Co. offices in New York . <p> " On a professional level , I do n't think much of replacement players , and I do n't think many people do , " Samelson said . " But if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we like it or not . " <p> There 's a historical precedent for the replacement concept . In May 1912 , Detroit outfielder Ty Cobb was suspended for charging into the stands and beating a heckler senseless . When Cobb 's teammates walked off the job in protest over his punishment , the Tigers recruited several sandlot players as fill-ins . <p> In their only appearance , the replacement Tigers lost 24-2 to Philadelphia . Detroit pitcher Aloysius Travers , who allowed 26 hits in eight innings , has been immortalized with a spot in the Baseball Encyclopedia . <p> Baseball has several precedents for shortened seasons , too . The 1918 season ended early because of World War I. In 1919 , owners voted to reduce the season to 140 games in an attempt to restrain salaries . Tris Speaker , Rogers Hornsby and Stuffy McInnis are among the players whose stat lines are slightly out of kilter because of the change . <p> Before the latest round of baseball strife , the 50-day strike of 1981 was considered the mother of all work stoppages . Tom Seaver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Morris tied for the major-league lead with 14 victories each , and Carney Lansford won the American League batting title with 399 at-bats . The strike of ' 81 could hinder Dale Murphy 's chances of making the Hall of Fame . Murphy , who finished his career with 398 homers , easily would have surpassed 400 if not for missing 58 games that season . <p> But as the historians are quick to point out , at least the 1981 season played out to its natural conclusion , with the Dodgers beating the Yankees in the World Series . " The way I look at it , 1981 was a heart palpitation , " James said . " Last year was a stroke . " <p> When the 1994 season ended in August , Matt Williams and Griffey were in hot pursuit of Roger Maris ' home-run record . Houston 's Jeff Bagwell hit 39 homers and drove in 116 runs - both club records - in 110 games . The mind boggles at what Griffey and Frank Thomas might have accomplished over 162 games . <p> Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some players ' aspirations . Cal Ripken 's pursuit of Lou Gehrig 's record for consecutive games played is in jeopardy . The clock is ticking for Dave Winfield , 43 years old and 37 homers short of 500 . And Paul Molitor , 353 hits short of 3,000 , is n't getting any closer to his goal during the strike . <p> From a statistician 's perspective , all the replacement scenarios and accompanying asterisks serve to fracture the sense of continuity that makes baseball so special . <p> " In a game like basketball , you ca n't compare statistics of players before and after the advent of the 24-second clock . It was a totally different era , " Hirdt said . " We take statistics like rebounds and assists for granted today , but they 've only been kept officially since the ' 50s and ' 60s . There 's no record of Wilt Chamberlain 's blocked shots , because they did n't track blocked shots in his day . <p> " In baseball , you can always look at a current player and compare him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played the exact same way . And the statistics are kept exactly the same way . That 's part of the lure of baseball statistics . They bridge so many different generations . " <p> So how will historians and fans recall the 1994-95 seasons 20 or 30 years from now , when the only reminder is a blip in the Baseball Encyclopedia ? <p> " I think everybody involved will be viewed as a symbol of athletic greed , the same way Michael Milken was a symbol for the greed of the ' 80s , " James said . " I suspect there wo n't be an awful lot of sympathy for baseball players for missing parts of two seasons .
