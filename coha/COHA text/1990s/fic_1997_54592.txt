Music is often called the universal language , but the same might be said of sculpture , or painting , or flower arranging ... in fact , many forms of artistic expression represent inner truth nonverbally . Does that include spirits ? <p> Aria sat in the straight-backed chair and trapped her hands between her knees , waiting for the poltergeist . It did n't always come ; lots of times when she wished it would show up it did nothing ; but today her favorite seventh-grade teacher , Mrs. Bridge , was having tea with Aria and her mother in their little third-floor apartment , and always , always , when Aria least wanted it to come , the poltergeist came . <p> " Sugar ? " Mother asked Mrs. Bridge , who smiled and nodded . Mrs. Bridge was wearing a warm red dress , and Mother wore her violet company dress , faded from washing to almost gray . A hearthfire and smoke , Aria thought . The herbal tea smelled good ; below its warmth lingered the faded scent of lavender . <p> Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glanced at Aria , saw the trapped hands . " Do n't ! " she said . <p> Mrs. Bridge , a comfortably large woman , mid-spectrum middle-aged , with short curly brown hair and big red-framed glasses , glanced at Aria , eyebrows up . <p> Mother handed Aria the tea cup she had been fixing for Mrs. Bridge . " Drink this . Do something . Do n't just sit there , Ari . " ' <p> Aria loosed her hands and took the tea cup , gulped tea even though it was scalding . <p> " Excuse me ? " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Mother . " She was about to have one of her fits . " <p> " Her fits , " said Mrs. Bridge . " Ah . " <p> Had she ever had a fit in one of Mrs. Bridge 's classes ? Aria wondered . She could n't remember one . What did Mrs. Bridge know ? <p> Mother poured another cup of tea and dropped sugar into it . " Cream ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite her teachers to the apartment ? It had n't bothered Aria when she was younger , before the poltergeist came . Or , it had n't bothered her much . She did n't really want teachers seeing how she lived . <p> Some of the teachers had felt sorry for her , she was sure , when they looked around this little room that was her and her mother 's whole world : the murphy bed folded into the wall , its underside decorated with a woven hanging ; the narrow doors leading to the closet and the bathroom ; the braided oval of rag rug on the floor ; the round scarred wooden table they were sitting at , with its navy cloth placemats and the pink plastic vase where Mother always put a sprig of something  --  even in the dead of winter she would find a twig with a bud on it , or a spray of holly leaves or pine needles ; the book shelves beside the radiator under the windows , where a few dark and stained tomes , some from the old country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which changed each week ; the slender selection of vinyl records in the shelf below the little white turntable with its attached speakers ; the little black-and-white TV on its own tiny table , with a wire hanger antenna twisted into an eternal lazy 8 ; the counter against the right-hand wall that held the sink , the stove , the cutting board , and the dish rack , with hanging cabinets above , where Aria and her mother kept food and their few dishes ; the little fridge in the corner , disguised with wood-grained brown Contact paper . <p> A small world , everything in it precious and cared for . Too small for Aria and her mother and the poltergeist , but the poltergeist did n't seem to care . Last year it had thrown a tea cup against the wall and frightened Mr. Piper , Aria 's sixth grade teacher , right out of the house . The tea cup had broken , too ; they only had three left now . <p> Aria drank more tea , hoping it would quiet Pell . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> None of the other kids ' mothers ever invited teachers home . At least , Aria had never heard of it . But then again , she was n't exactly in the gossip stream at school . <p> She did n't think other people drank tea with teachers , either . She never saw television children drinking tea . When television people used tea cups , they drank coffee , except the ones on PBS . <p> " Cream , " said Mrs. Bridge . " Yes , please . " <p> Mother added a ribbon of cream to the tea . Aria watched it slide beneath the surface and then rise again from the bottom , billowing like a cloud just before Mother stirred it with a spoon and then offered the cup , spoon , saucer , and a napkin to Mrs. Bridge . <p> " Thank you so much for making time in your busy schedule to stop in and see us , " Mother said to Mrs. Bridge . <p> " My pleasure , " said Mrs. Bridge , accepting a sugar-sprinkled butter cookie from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm always pleasantly surprised when a parent takes an interest in a child 's education . " <p> " I have high hopes for Ari , " Mother said , glancing at Aria , offering her a cookie . Aria took one . There were only five . Two each for Mother and Mrs. Bridge , one for her . She had better make this one last . <p> " Yes ? " said Mrs. Bridge . Somehow she sounded a shade less friendly than she had a moment before . <p> " She 's doing well in school , is n't she ? She does n't tell me much about her days , " Mother said . <p> Aria sipped tea and watched one of her library books slide slowly toward the edge of its shelf . <p> " I think that 's a matter for you to discuss with Aria , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> " But  --  " said Mother . " She really does n't say much . " <p> Mrs. Bridge looked at Aria . She smiled . " What do you think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The book jumped out of the shelf and thumped on the floor . <p> Mrs. Bridge , seated with her back to the windows , glanced over her shoulder at the fallen book . <p> " Ari , " said Mother , her voice fading . <p> " I 'm doing fine , " Aria said loudly as the book stood on its end , then opened with a flutter of pages . <p> " That 's right , " said Mrs. Bridge , watching the book . " She 's doing fine . " <p> The book thumped over , playing dead . <p> " And your hopes ? " Mrs. Bridge asked . <p> " Pardon me ? " said Mother . <p> " You mentioned something about your hopes for your daughter , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> " Did I ? I  --  I  --  well , I ... " <p> " Do you have hopes , Ari ? " Mrs. Bridge asked , staring into Aria 's eyes . <p> " No , " said Aria . She looked at her cookie . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lick the sugar crystals from it one at a time . There were a lot of them . <p> " What do you think about your mother 's hopes for you ? Do you know what they are ? " <p> " She wants me to be an opera singer , " Aria said . She glanced at the record player on the bookshelf . Some of the opera records were so old and scratched Mother did n't even try to play them anymore . The skips interrupted the singers too often . " What do you want , Aria ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Aria said . Books fluttered from the shelf , thumping on the rug , each thump a punctuation . <p> Mrs. Bridge turned and watched the books , which thumped down , jumped on end , thumped down again , stacked themselves . <p> Mother 's hands were clutched so tight about her tea cup the knuckles showed white . Her mouth was open and her eyes stared , but not at the books or anything in the room . Aria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some evenings when Pell was louder and more irritating than usual . Never before with company right in the room . <p> " Who knows what you want ? " Mrs. Bridge asked , watching the books . The books opened and clapped loudly in a chorus . <p> " Who cares what I want ? " Aria said . Why was Mrs. Bridge asking questions ? Why was n't she screaming out the door as others had done before her ? How could she just sit there and watch the books dance , as though she saw such things every day ? <p> The books fell to the floor as if they had never been animated . <p> " I , for one , would like to know , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> What do I want ? Aria wondered . She glanced around the apartment . The records  --  all her mother 's . No CDs here . No money for them , no desire for them  --  at least , her mother had no desire for them . The fragments of tunes and songs Aria heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and car windows and the windows of houses Aria walked past on her way to schoool , the " new music " her mother said was not music , all these scraps of sound called to Aria . Everyone else knows my language , music sang , and you , you are not allowed to hear and learn it . <p> She thought of sitting in the music room and pounding on a wood block while the other children had instruments to play . She had talked to Mr. Steel about renting an instrument . A clarinet , she thought , a tone like melted butter , a range from the stars above to the bottom of the sea . But her mother had only a little money , and none for things like instrument rental . <p> " You are your instrument , " Mother would say . " Take care of your voice . Train it . Use it . Sing this chorus again . " Sheet music from a thrift store , words whose meaning Aria did not know but whose sound she learned from listening to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she came home from school and before most of the people in neighboring apartments came home from work . She did n't want anyone to hear her . She was afraid of her voice . Sometimes when she sang it got loud . It got away from her . It soared , carrying the tune . <p> She would sing for her mother in the evenings , trying to keep her voice softer than it wanted to be . Her mother would listen and smile . <p> Lately , Pell had slammed doors while Aria sang for her mother . Mostly the bathroom door . Slam slam slam . " O , holy night , " slam , " the stars are brightly shiiiiining , " slam . Mother thought Aria could sing at school in the Christmas show ; surely if she had a prepared piece , they could find a place for her in the program . Slam . Aria had never sung where anyone but Mother or Pell could hear her . <p> Slam . <p> Then there was paint . Mrs. Bridge taught English and art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aria had spent whole hours stroking colors side by side onto paper . She swirled things . She got mud brown colors by mixing , and then she learned to mix for creamy orange and light purple and pale green . While other people did whatever projects Mrs. Bridge assigned each day , Aria sat with her colors in front of her and made pictures that did n't look like anything you could see when you looked around an apartment or a street . Just swirls and pools of color . <p> Sometimes she painted with her fingers . Sometimes she mixed up colors and pressed her hands into them and then slapped her hands onto the paper . <p> Aria rarely brought her pictures home . Mother did n't like them . " Ca n't you do a nice still life ? " she had asked . <p> Mrs. Bridge liked them , though . She had asked to keep some . <p> Then there was science class , where Ms. Claire taught them the world in pieces and puzzles . Shake up these body parts and then assemble them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piecing together a bird from pinions and down and muscles and organs and hollow bones and the lace of nerves and branching trees of blood vessels . Aria loved the language of science : thorax , abdomen , mandible , proboscis ; style , stigma , ovary ... <p> She was not sure she would want to spend the rest of her life buried under such language , so many details . She liked them ; she could build walls with them ; but were walls enough , when she could have color or music instead ? <p> Aria looked at Mrs. Bridge . " Any news ? " Mrs. Bridge asked . <p> " What ? " said Aria . <p> " Do you know yet what you want ? " <p> " No , " said Aria . <p> " Well , you 're young yet . You have time to try different things . " <p> " You know what you want , " said Mother . " Your marvelous instrument ! Your beautiful voice ! " <p> The record player leaped high into the air , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts spilling from it . <p> " Pell ! " Aria said . " No ! " <p> The albums shot from their sleeves on the shelf , sliced through the air between the people sitting at the table , and crashed into the wall beside the entrance , shattered , fragments sliding down into sharp-edged rubble on the floor . <p> Tears ran down Mother 's face . She cried without sound except a hitch in her breath . <p> " I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I 'm sorry , " Aria muttered , wrapping her arms around her head , elbows jutting out . " I 'll be good I 'll be extra good I 'll be so good you do n't know I 'm here ... " <p> " My music . All my music ... I can never replace those records , " Mother said , her voice strangled . She sniffed . She patted the tears from her face with her napkin . " Never . " <p> " Tell me their titles , " said Mrs. Bridge . " I 'll see what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel responsible . " <p> " How can you be responsible when it 's Ari who does these things ? " Mother said . <p> There it was . Usually Aria did not discuss Pell with Mother . Usually Pell did small irritating things and both of them pretended this was just some normal inconvenience that everyone had to deal with at home . Mother had never before blamed Aria for what Pell did . Not directly , anyway . <p> Aria , mired in guilt and the spill of sorties , rocked in her chair and hid her head with her arms . If only Pell would go away and never never never come back . Pell wrecked everything . Pell broke things . Pell scared people . Pell hurt Mother . <p> Mrs. Bridge touched her arm . " Aria , " she said . She poured tea , sugared it , tugged Aria 's arm down . " Here , sweetie . " <p> It took Aria a while to stop rocking and scratching herself up on the inside . Pell had never broken something so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . But the tea cup last year , that had hurt a lot . Not as much as the loss of the records , though . <p> She managed to stop saying she was sorry . She took the tea from Mrs. Bridge and sipped it . The feeling of being a horrible evil person did n't go away . <p> She glanced at Mother 's face , saw the lines of suffering . The music was one of the few things that made Mother feel better when she came home from work . How often in the evening Aria had watched Mother as Mother listened to the music , her eyes looking at something far away and beautiful , something that carried her away from a world of dirty dishes and steaming water and the realities of a vanished husband , few job skills , and a stack of leftover bills from a previous life . <p> Aria would not forgive Pell for this deed . " How could you ? " she whispered . " How could you ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong questions . " <p> " I ca n't bear it any longer , " Mother said . She looked around their room , their world . No place was distant from any other place . Every place was in view . " I must go . " <p> She rose , grabbed her purse and jacket , and rushed out . <p> " Oh , Aria , " Mrs. Bridge said , " I did n't mean for any of this to happen . " <p> " It 's not your fault , " said Aria . " How could it be ? It 's my fault , is n't it ? I do n't understand it . I do n't see a Pell on television very often . I never see a Pell at school . Am I the only one who has a Pell ? " <p> " No , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> " I mean , I know Pell is a poltergeist . There 's a word for it . I just do n't know anyone else who has one . " Aria rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records lay in pieces and picked them up , wondering if she could glue them together and bring the music back to life . The pieces were too small and many . She did n't know if she could mend things with Mother , either . <p> " You do n't seem surprised by this , " Aria said , putting the pieces in the trash carefully , as though there was anything worse that could happen to them . <p> " Surprised ? By the Pell , you mean ? " asked Mrs. Bridge . <p> " Did you know about Pell before you came over ? " <p> " No . Not exactly . I knew there was something different about you . " <p> Aria sat back on her heels and looked at her teacher . " Different ? " She could n't remember ever being different . Most of the time she was silent , but there were a number of other kids in school who were quiet too . If she raised her hand , she never raised it high . If she had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher forced her to participate , she was subdued . " How could you tell ? " <p> " The pictures , " said Mrs. Bridge . " The things you paint . " <p> " Things ? But I do n't paint things . " <p> " You do . You paint things people do n't see with their normal eyes . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " I do n't think I can explain it any more clearly , dear . The things you paint are visions seen with something beyond sight . I 've seen such pictures before . I came to visit because I wanted to make sure you do n't lose those visions unless you are ready to let go of them . I know you do n't take your pictures home . I 've found them in the garbage before . So I suspected your mother was n't very supportive of your art . " <p> Aria sat with chunks of broken record in each hand and looked up at her teacher . She saw that Mother 's abandoned tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yelled . " No , Pell , not another one ! " <p> The cup flew at the wall above where she crouched . It splashed tea on the wall , then drifted back to settle sedately on its saucer on the table . <p> Aria looked at the wall . There was an explosion there in pale brown against the white paint . <p> " Yes , " said Mrs. Bridge , as Aria jumped up and got a sponge out of the sink . " I do n't know if your hopes include painting , Aria . If they do , I would hate to see you give it up . " <p> Aria wiped some of the tea from the wall . " Her hopes are more important than mine , " she said in a low voice . " She has suffered so . " <p> " I see , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> " She takes care of me . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " She hates her job . " <p> " Ah . " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like the neighbors . It 's cold out . " <p> " She 'll be back , " said Mrs. Bridge . <p> Aria got the whisk broom and dust pan and swept up the final fragments of records . " I do n't know when she 'll forgive me for this . " <p> " Give me some paper . I 'll ' write down the album titles and see how many I can replace . " <p> " Why ? Why would you do that , Mrs. Bridge ? " <p> " Because this world is so small , too small for two people when one wo n't forgive the other . And because I am glad to learn about Pell . I thought perhaps you needed a champion . I 'm glad you already have one . " <p> " A champion ? " Aria said . She thought of all the annoying things Pell did , the trouble Pell caused . Sometimes Pell made the bed jump when Aria and her mother were already asleep . Sometimes the lights went on and off even when Aria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings , the house keys  --  and could n't be found ; hours later or sometimes days , the things turned up right where they had been before they disappeared . Aria had never seen a pattern in the haunting . It had just been one long chain of annoyances . <p> " Pell wo n't let your heart smother , " said Mrs. Bridge . She went to the bookshelf , pulled out the album covers and brought them to the table . <p> Two sheets of lined paper shot out of Aria 's school notebook and drifted down in front of Mrs. Bridge . <p> " Thank you , " she said , smiling , and pulled a pen out of her purse . <p> " You 're welcome , " Aria whispered . She looked at what was left of the tea splash . Some kind of vision . She could almost see a forest . Trees , anyway . She studied it a little while before she wiped it away . <p> CARTOON : " Thank you very much . Next ! " <p> <p> <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
