Will women take their newfound power and separate themselves from men ? Or will biological technologies allow men and women to become more alike ? A futures researcher and political scientist examines five potential scenarios for women . // Women 's status in Western societies has undergone dramatic changes in the past four decades . The changing status of women is not simply a lifestyle change or a minor alteration of social patterns . It is an unprecedented transformation in our social and cultural reality . And we have only seen the tip of the iceberg . The historical subordination of women is nearing the threshold of collapse . Social , cultural , political , and technological changes are converging to eat away the structures of male dominance . Over the next millennium , women ( and men ) are likely to undergo enormous changes , psychologically , culturally , biologically , physiologically , and even genetically . Thus , women in the future may be considerably different from what they have been in the past . This author is the wrong gender to describe women 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying what women have said and written about their experience and by looking through more objective evidence , such as statistical data . While women have succeeded in making some inroads into decisionmaking positions in business and government , they are still expected to perform traditional functions of maintaining a household , taking care of the kids , fixing the meals , and being a good spouse . Not an easy chore . And while the image of superwoman has been featured in both advertising and women 's magazines , the image has , of late , come under fire for being just what it issuperhuman-and not a normal state of activity . To understand the potential transformational power of the women 's movement , we must also understand the growing social and cultural power that comes from the least understood and most maligned part of the women 's movement : the radical feminist movement . Radical feminism was always a strand of the women 's movement , even as far back as the nineteenth century , but the radical feminists parted ways with the political feminists sometime during the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different path . Where political feminists want to be equally represented along with men , radical feminists want a totally different power structure . Where political feminists want policies and laws that assist women and families , the radicals want a totally new spiritual paradigm . Beginning with the premise that the personal is political , radical feminists argue that to adopt traditional political methods would be to play into the hands of male institutions . They seek instead to recreate their own world , their own reality , and give energy to new , female-centered institutions rather than the old male ones . One segment of radical feminists has rediscovered or recreated the pagan practices of the pre-Christian world . They now actively promote Great Goddess worship and paganism or female-oriented aspects of mainstream religions . Mythic remnants of pagan mother-goddess worship can be found in nearly all patriarchal religions : Islam , Judaism , and Christianity . The importance of the Virgin Mary in Catholicism is a classic example . This trend in women 's culture is growing and not easily swept under the rug . While it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , the cultural implications have the potential to be seen in nearly every aspect of life over the next century or two . Trends Suggest Potential Scenarios There are at least three mini-trends stemming from radical feminism that could result in dramatically different futures for women-and men . One of those has been called lesbian separatism , a tendency for some women to reject men entirely as some sort of evolutionary mistake . This movement has less to do with sexual orientation than with the acceptance of an entirely different paradigm , one that rejects maleinfluenced values . At virtually the opposite end of the spectrum is male hatred of women , or misogyny , manifesting itself as a widespread male backlash against women . There are already symptoms of this throughout society , and the potential for a reversal in the status of women is a growing possibility . The pressures on men are growing and thus the chances of male backlash may grow . Just as the anti-immigrant movement in Europe has been fueled by loosened immigration laws , so , too , may violence against women grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-trend that has roots in radical feminism is the push toward a partnership model of relations between men and women rather than the dominance of either . While the partnership model might suggest a radical redefinition of gender roles and the division of labor in societyeven the end of patriarchal religions as we know them-it argues against violence toward either gender and for the growth of healthy relationships between men and women . One way to make some sense out of these sometimes converging and sometimes conflicting trends is to consider a range of alternative futures for women . These scenarios are suggested in some cases by women 's images of the future and in other cases by dominant social , cultural , environmental , and technological trends . These scenarios are intended to show distinct images of how women 's social status may evolve . The five scenarios described below are summarized in the chart appearing on page 37 . Scenario #1 : Continued Patriarchy Continued Patriarchy is similar to the " continued growth " or " business-as-usual " image of the future used in futures research . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in popular magazines , and embodied in business , government , and cultural institutions . This type of future has been characterized as the " future most like the present , " only more so , " " and championed by futurists such as the late Herman Kahn . In this scenario , women continue to obtain their rights but at the cost of playing " supermom " and/or becoming more like men . Women are increasingly accepted in the work force in industrialized countries , but are slow to achieve equal pay for equal work and to break the glass ceiling into management positions . Women in the developing world continue to be exploited and violated more than their sisters in industrialized countries . The family model in this scenario is still that of the Industrial Age : a mother , father , and two or three children . Levels of spouse and child abuse remain high . Scenario #2 : High-Tech Androgyny Society experiences a technological transformation that produces basic shifts in the relations between men and women and in most social structures . High-Tech Androgyny is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation and human procreation . In this scenario , work is something one does because one is good at it or because it gives one personal satisfaction . Gender divisions of labor no longer exist . Leisure " work " allows all people to engage in whatever sport , artistic form , handicraft , hobby , or activity they wish . Politics is something women are more equitably involved in due to shifts in child rearing , domestic work , and work outside the home . Children are " designed " from the best genetic material , gestated in either natural or artificial wombs , and raised in age-cohort groups by robot ( and human ) nannies . Children are also expected to experiment with sex before puberty . Rites of passage often include gender changes . Family roles are totally blurred or nonexistent . Gene and other molecular therapies have markedly increased human longevity . Scenario #3 : Separation In this future , the insular lesbian movement has ascended , as presaged by the astounding growth of female heads of households in the United States . Many lesbians impregnate themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space settlements are inhabited solely by women ; other communities segregate men and women . The assumption here in the Separation scenario is that men fail to mend their ways , so women decide to do without them . Whether sent to space " on vacation " or otherwise disposed of ( perhaps through a genetic epidemic in which only men are victims ) , men are no longer a problem . Cloning and artificial insemination are the primary means of procreation in this future . Family structures are extended and intergenerational , including sisters , daughters , aunts , and donors as well as surrogate mothers , grandmothers , and great grandmothers . Families are headed by the oldest matriarchs . Scenario #4 : Backlash In this future , men have had it with uppity women and put them " back in their place . " This could occur after a major global ecological or economic catastrophe , such as depicted in Margaret Atwood 's chilling backlash future , The Handmaid 's Tale . A Backlash scenario is suggested by some men 's increasing frustration with the growing power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . While much of the men 's movement may be a reasonable exploration of men 's traditional and evolving gender roles , there is also a clear misogynist element to it . // Futures of Women // Other trends that suggest a reinvigorated hatred of women are the explosive growth of religious ( patriarchal ) fundamentalism , efforts to end affirmative action , and growing violence against women . Another trend that fits this scenario is the fact that in some countries amniocentesis results in up to 95% of all female fetuses being aborted . In the Backlash scenario , men reclaim dominance over women , who are considered to be property . Slavery ( of women ) has returned . Women are expected to chop wood , carry water , and bear children , and they are no longer allowed to learn to read and write . Polygamy becomes common , especially for the wealthy . The number of wives is a sign of wealth . Male children are preferred , and female infanticide is common . Scenario #5 : Partnership In the Partnership scenario , the basic biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power with men equally . Gender differences are respected , but women and men are treated equally in all spheres of life . Women have extensive involvement , at all levels , equitably with men in the public sphere . In this scenario , there are fewer gender-based divisions of labor , and parenting is a shared responsibility . Family structures are extended and intergenerational , with tolerance for a wide range of family forms ( including non-blood-related ) . Communities and eco-cities are built around extended family " estates . " Women 's Visions These scenarios of the future are not intended to be a definitive compilation of the rich body of women 's and feminist literature . They are only intended as glimpses of alternative possibilities in the next century and beyond . Some of these scenarios may be more probable than others ; some , more preferable . In any case , it is important to examine a full range of possibilities , because certain elements of each of these scenarios may be what lies ahead . There is no question in the author 's mind that women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical transformation of the social fabric . To assume only " more of the same " in the future is truly an unrealistic expectation . One message is that women must continue to envision , create , and realize their own futures .
