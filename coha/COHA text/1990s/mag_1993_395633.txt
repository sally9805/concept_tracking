Cheryl Hudson is having a great day at the office . The art deal went through ; the contract is the mail . Why not toot my own horn ? she muses . So she calls the company president to share her good news . The president is pleased . Her hard work will bring the company bigger revenues , he tells her . Then , as a playful smile tugs at the corner of Cheryl 's lips , she insists on getting a raise- ... more employee benefits ... a company car and  --  she whispers this request into the telephone receiver  --  dinner on the table when she gets home . The company president laughs . The car , he tells her , is a possibility  --  if she agrees to drive him to work in it every day . More benefits ? Maybe . The raise ? They 'll talk about it . Dinner ? A sure bet . Perhaps Cheryl 's approach is n't the best way to make requests of the guy in the corner office . But when your business partner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as important as his  --  you can afford to be a little bit smug , even playful , at times . But working with the one you love does n't mean you 'll always get your way ; there are pros and cons . For many couples who run businesses together and know the secrets of making it work , the lifestyle is fulfilling  --  and fun . Married since 1972 , Cheryl and Wade Hudson are cofounders of Just Us Books , a children's-book publishing firm based in Orange , New Jersey . Cheryl , the company 's vice president and publisher , runs Just Us Books as an equal partner with her husband , Wade , the company president and chief executive officer . TURNING AN IDEA INTO A BUSINESS Just Us Books grew out of their similar interests . " When we met , I worked in textbook publishing . Wade was a magazine writer , playwright and public-relations specialist . When we had children , we looked at children 's books and did n't see anything we liked , " Cheryl recalls . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we decided to publish our own books . " Rejected by mainstream publishers , the Hudsons started their business and wrote a business plan to determine how many books they could reasonably publish and how they wanted Just Us Books to grow in manufacturing and sales each year . Part of the business plan included a financial outline that helped them see how long it would take to turn a profit ( most business owners say it takes three to five years ) , and how long they could operate within their self-proposed budget . Last , the plan listed each partner 's role in the company . With the business plan in place , they invested $7,000 from their savings and published the Afro-Bets ABC Book in 1988 , out of Cheryl 's studio in their basement . Aiming at educators , they sent out review copies . A good review in a leading education magazine and a small ad in The New York Times Book Review garnered attention . " We got lots of exposure in Black newspapers and media . Our base became Black bookstores , whose numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today Just Us Books publishes four titles a year , now carried by national chain stores , such as Toys " R " Us , Hallmark , Target and Kmart . With 16 titles in print , the company 's 1992 sales reached about $1 million . Because of the increase in titles and wider distribution in chain stores , Wade projects net revenues of at least $2 million for their current fiscal year . Starting a business with a seed of an idea was a similar process for Carolyn and L.C. Scott , who run I 'M BLESSED , a T-shirt and novelty-gifts manufacturer based in Los Angeles , and for Sharon and Jerry C. Roberts , III , coproprietors of JSR Enterprises , Inc. , a plumbing and sewer subcontracting firm in Country Club Hills , Ill . Each couple drew money from savings to get the business started and laid a solid foundation by drafting and following a business plan . Unlike the Hudsons , one partner kept a full-time job to support the family until the business was solvent . But how do you handle it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your mate have differing ideas about money ? Separate workstyles ? Conflicting opinions about how the company should be operated ? These are common snags that many work-together couples face , says Dr. Toni Heris , a New York City psychologist and career consultant . " One of the keys to working successfully with your spouse is setting boundaries  --  deciding on each person 's function in the company  --  and respecting those parameters , " Heris says . SEPARATE BUT EQUAL To keep disagreements at a minimum , Heris advises couples to schedule time for a weekly review , a " staff meeting " that 's conducted like a meeting in a traditional office environment . " This is the time to sum up what 's gone right  --  or wrong  --  in the company and to openly address glitches . By discussing concerns when they arise and keeping problems aboveboard , couples can avoid difficulties before they fester , " Heris says . Couples who run companies together say one of the advantages is that they intimately know each other 's limitations , strengths and motivations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other when the going gets tough . For book publishers Cheryl and Wade Hudson , few power struggles arise . " Wade has more the personality to deal with suppliers and to negotiate contracts  --  that 's why he 's the president of the company . Because my training and interests are geared more toward design , I have the final say on artistic decisions . I 'm best as the publisher . We 're clear about our roles , and we respect each other , " Cheryl says . Subcontractors Sharon and Jerry C. Roberts , III , also keep their functions separate . Neither acts as boss ; both have different functions that keep the business growing  --  Sharon handles accounting and administrative duties for the firm , and Jerry oversees the technical aspects of plumbing . The separate-but-equal workstyle is also a cornerstone of success for T-shirt and novelty-gifts manufacturers Carolyn and L.C. Scott . " We 're partners , " says Carolyn . " Our biggest success secret is that we have n't fallen out of love ! " MAKE YOUR PARTNERSHIP PAY OFF Before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips : * Research your idea at a library .
