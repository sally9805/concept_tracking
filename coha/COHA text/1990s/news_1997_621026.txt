<p> SEX AND SENSIBILITY <p> Stories of a Lesbian Generation <p> By Arlene Stein <p> University of California Press ; 256 pages ; $ 17.95 paperback ; $ 45 hardcover <p> One of the great paradoxes of lesbian life in the ' 90s , as University of Oregon sociologist Arlene Stein observes , is that an identifiable " lesbian community " is disappearing even as increasing numbers of women live openly as lesbians . <p> When , for example , Amelia 's , the last lesbian bar in San Francisco , closed in 1991 , the owner explained , as Stein quotes her , that the bar was " a victim of the lesbian community becoming more diverse . There is an absence of a lesbian community in the presence of a million lesbians . " <p> Participants in the lesbian movement since the ' 70s may be aware of the changing landscape as the " L-word " goes the way of the " F-word " ( that 's Feminist to you , sister ) . But Stein explores contemporary lesbian history with the kind of detail that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point the spelling of " wimmin " or " womyn " or " wymyn " was so im portant ) . She uses good , chunky quotes from the personal stories of Bay Area lesbians and winds up with some provocative conclusions  --  finding , for example , that while young lesbians today may not identify with a lesbian community , they believe that being lesbian is a " highly salient , central aspect of the self . " You 'll have to slog through labored academic writing ( " they problematized heterosexuality "  --  Heavens ! Leave those poor straight people alone ! ) , but the delight here is Stein 's refusal to allow glib or surface observation and her wondrous way of digging to the heart of every lesbian matter . <p> THE RISE AND FALL OF GAY CULTURE <p> By Daniel Harris <p> Hyperion ; 278 pages ; $ 24.95 <p> The world of gay men , too , is changing so fast , says Harper 's magazine contributor Daniel Harris , that " essential elements of gay culture . . . have changed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actresses has be come the ridicule of actresses ; butch , tattooed bodies have become effeminate , ' decorated ' ones ; exotic , playful drag queens have become mean , militarized gender f- ; sadistic leathermen have become macrobiotic neopagans , " and so on . <p> The stimulus for such reversals is an extraordinary assimilation process accelerated by corporate America 's exploitation of gay markets ; the " heterosexualizing of gay love " ( Heavens ! Leave those poor gay people alone ! ) ; the publication of glossy , upscale gay magazines ; and the commercialization of every gay thing from bodies , booze , cars and vacations to AIDS , the " first disease to have its own gift shop . " <p> Sometimes Harris sounds like a whiner , crying for the old days when the gay community was as identifiable as a tribe , reacting in horror as gays now commit " subcultural suicide " in their fervor to " submerge into the melting pot . " But then his wry , dry humor and trenchant observations win us over , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their penchant for " Hollywood diva worship . " <p> He surprises us by describing his own childhood in Appalachia , " a land of lazy Southern drawls , " where he alone developed a British accent . He never knew why until watching old movies as an adult , and voila ! There were Joan Crawford , Katharine Hepburn , Grace Kelly , Bette Davis and others who " conversed in a manufactured Hollywood idiom meant to suggest refinement and good breeding . " How he " branded " this version of " culture and gentility " on his own vocal cords is the beginning of a spirited journey through gay life that delights and enlightens ( and frustrates ) along the way . <p> FLAMING IGUANAS <p> An Illustrated All-Girl Road Novel Thing <p> By Erika Lopez <p> Simon &; Schuster ; 272 pages ; $ 18.50 <p> ' I wondered if you were a lesbian would you still find Clint Eastwood sexy ? Or would you see through his whole furrowed-brow facade but still be able to vote for him for mayor of Carmel ? " Such are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sits in a Jacuzzi with her lesbian mother and prepares for her motorcycle trip " from armpit to armpit across the chest of America " with her friend Magdalena . <p> Of course , Tomato prepares too long and , once on the road , thinks too much about the life she 's left behind in New Jersey . In the Jacuzzi scene , Tomato 's mother is fighting with her lover , Violet , with whom she has participated in couples therapy so much that their conversation is littered with boundary issues , food and security issues , feelings of hurt , feelings of being " discounted and attacked " and who 's going to call the therapist first . It ends with shouting and slammed doors , at which point Tomato says , " See ? That was beautiful , the way you both worked that problem out . . . You two have a gentler , more profound relationship than any heterosexual couple I 've seen . " <p> Funny and profound at times , silly and labored at others , " Flaming Iguanas " lurches from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90s angst . No doubt author Erika Lopez tries too hard to sound hip and outrageous ( " we 'll live off the fumes from our estrogen " ) . But attempting to blow Gen-X Latina Grrrl rhetoric to kingdom come and question America 's bent for sexual taboos at the same time , Lopez gives Tomato a kind of outlaw integrity that " Thelma and Louise " only hinted at . By the time she rides into San Francisco , Tomato 's quest for identity and freedom actually becomes our own . <p> UNBOUND <p> A Book of AIDS <p> By Aaron Shurin <p> Sun &; Moon ; 89 pages ; $ 19.95 <p> ' Ten years of AIDS has altered my poetic gift , narrowed my eye , humbled my languages , " writes San Francisco poet Aaron Shurin ( " Into Distances , " " Nativity " ) . In this small but powerful volume of prose pieces , Shurin reveals a process of death , both morbid and transcendent , that gay men have claimed as their own . <p> He delights in the humor he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibetan Buddhist student , is " trying to die well " through meditation but finds his mantra invaded by the recurring theme from " Bonanza . " He admits that seeing so many friends die for so long a time creates a permanent sense of being haunted ( " I know he may whiff and re-congeal in another street , another cafe " ) . <p> The best parts are the most challenging . In " Human Immune , " Shurin condenses all of poetry 's power into thick , dense , crowded sentences that speak both to posterity and an unbearable presence  --  of Kaposi 's sarcoma legions , loss of grace , death stalking near and the grip of sex and terror all at once : <p> " Dead from complicity in San Francisco discharged me , the harp of a person had an arc . Then listen to inhale the contagion , where in the trap of your consciousness you have to pull to get out . Himself alone and scared kill mercies . The body has powers to paint yourself purple . " <p> SEXUAL ECOLOGY <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotello <p> Dutton ; 310 pages ; $ 24.95 <p> If you believe the AIDS epidemic is slowly being contained by revolutionary drugs such as protease inhibitors , which do seem to bring dying PWAs ( People with AIDS ) back to life , this book is a chiller . There is no such thing as real " containment " or " cure " when it comes to this kind of plague , says former New York Newsday columnist Gabriel Rotello : " If gay men mistakenly believe that the epidemic is waning and return to the habits of the past , rapidly transmitting new , drug-resistant strains of HIV across newly reconstituted viral highways , the potential for tragedy is almost unthinkable . " <p> Those " habits of the past " include the kind of multipartner sex that was once considered the source of gay liberation and now must be seen as one of its greatest threats , Rotello claims . While use of condoms is certainly a must , he adds , condoms do fail and should never have been considered the sole answer to AIDS prevention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' 80s ( trust in the condom as a " technological fix " to make sex safe ) has been a distraction from the real need of creating a " sustainable " gay life and culture . <p> That 's why the " second wave " of AIDS began in the early ' 90s , when younger gay men in San Francisco began to have " the highest levels of unsafe sex and the worst level of new infections . " Today , Rotello says , " it is reasonably accurate to say that no more than about half of all gay men have ever used condoms consistently as a response to AIDS . " The answer , he suggests , lies in a new , deeper , larger understanding of " holistic prevention " that will stop a coming " third wave " of AIDS infection .
