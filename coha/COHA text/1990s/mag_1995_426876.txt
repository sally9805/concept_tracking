Section : Business &; technology Price pressure , the monster that menaced the economy , has met its master <p> Ask an economist about the dangers of inflation in the United States and you 'll probably get a history lesson  --  one that centers on the oil shocks of the 1970s and the double-digit price increases that resulted . But pick that same economist 's brain about the lack of inflationary pressure in the 1990s and be prepared for a different answer : A new era of price stability appears to be at hand . <p> Recent economic indicators buttress this conclusion . The Labor Department announced last week that wholesale prices dropped by 0.1 percent in October , the second decline in the past three months . The gross domestic product deflator  --  which measures the price growth of goods and services produced in the United States  --  rose by a mere 0.6 percent in the third quarter of this year , the smallest increase in more than 30 years . And the consumer price index ( CPI ) , the nation 's chief inflation barometer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1995 . Many forecasters predict that the CPI will rise by an anemic 2.5 percent next year . " I 've never seen so many factors contributing to low inflation , " notes Allen Sinai , chief global economist at Lehman Brothers . What 's more , a congressionally appointed commission , chaired by Stanford economist Michael Boskin , recently reported that the CPI may overstate inflation by as much as 2 full percentage points . <p> With this in mind , the financial markets are turning their attention to Washington , where the Federal Reserve 's Open Market Committee meets this week . Fed policy makers will likely discuss whether the time is right to relieve some of the anti-inflationary pressure created by tight monetary policy and boost the economy with an interest-rate cut . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted that he is not yet ready to declare victory over inflation and will remain vigilant . " Price stability is an ongoing objective , " Greenspan cautioned in a speech last week , " and past successes will not count for much if we mistakenly let down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the Fed is unnecessarily constraining economic growth to blunt an inflationary threat that does n't exist . They also point to an economy that appears to be stumbling and a high real federal funds rate ( the federal funds rate minus inflation ) of more than 3 percent as grounds for monetary easing . The federal funds rate now sits about a full percentage point higher than nominal GDP , says Merrill Lynch economist Bruce Steinberg , an indicator that has led to interest-rate cuts in the past . <p> Lower rates . Just down the street from the Fed , Congress is in the process of debating a balanced-budget plan that could go a long way toward resolving some of the differences between Greenspan and his critics . The Fed chairman has been vocal in his calls for deficit reduction , implying that he would find it easier to cut short-term interest rates if a program to balance the budget was enacted . Some Wall Street analysts , meanwhile , are predicting that a balanced-budget deal could force long-term interest rates down even further . Edward Hyman , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that balancing the budget could send long-term bond yields tumbling by as much as a full point . In addition , a budget agreement could increase net national savings and investments and raise productivity and future growth . <p> The current price stability stems from a number of changes that have helped reshape the country 's economic landscape over the past decade . Until recently , conventional wisdom had it that an unemployment rate under 6 percent gave workers the leverage they needed to demand higher wages , which , absent offsetting productivity gains , would spur inflation . But in recent months , the jobless rate has hovered around 5.5 percent , and the Employment Cost Index  --  which tracks workers ' wages and benefits , two thirds of total business expenses  --  has measured its smallest gains since it was first recorded in 1981 . <p> One factor contributing to this environment of stagnant wages and low unemployment , analysts say , is that workers  --  blue- and white-collar alike  --  have less job security than in the past . Union membership levels have dwindled , depriving many workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hikes . And legions of companies now hire temporary employees whenever possible and purchase services  --  called outsourcing  --  so they do n't have to pay for benefits like medical coverage . <p> Companies are putting the squeeze on workers because they , too , are feeling pinched  --  in part , by an increasingly competitive global economy . World trade flows have been growing more than twice as fast as global output , meaning that more manufactured goods are crossing international boundaries every day . As a result , warns Steinberg , " whether you 're a multinational or a domestic company , you have less control over pricing today than you did in the past . " <p> Unable to raise prices , American companies are generating profits by getting more out of less . Productivity has grown an average of 2.3 percent a year since 1991 , compared with 1 percent average annual growth in the 1980s . Workers and executives are constantly developing ways to improve their operations without substantially increasing the costs of doing business . One key element of productivity growth is the technology boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microprocessor is about 750 times more powerful than the one that went into IBM 's first personal computer in 1981 , yet it costs slightly less in real terms . <p> Overstated . Inflation is already very low , but a growing number of economists believe it is even lower than we currently think . As a measure of inflation , they say , the CPI is methodologically flawed . Among the problems with the price index , explains Boskin , is the fact that it compares price changes of a basket of goods and services that dates back to 1982 . When people shop today , he points out , they tend to buy a very different supply of products than they did 13 years ago . And the CPI does not recognize that quality improvements often accompany price hikes . Add an air bag to a car , for example , and it suddenly becomes problematic to compare the cost of that automobile with the previous year 's model that had no air bag . <p> Lowering the CPI measurement in response to these criticisms could cut billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget  --  such as Social Security payments  --  are indexed each year based on the CPI 's rate of increase . If this traditional measure of inflation exaggerates the annual increase in the cost of living by 1 percentage point , for instance , $634 billion will be added to the federal debt over the next 10 years . " The overindexing will itself become the fourth-largest spending program in the budget by 2005 , " says Boskin . <p> America has done a remarkable job of taming inflation in recent years . Indeed , price expectations among consumers and companies have been dramatically dampened . Despite the turnaround , however , some inflation hawks worry that this is a short-term phenomenon . Allaying their fears wo n't be easy , but the continued expansion of free trade and global competition as well as a long-term commitment to fiscal prudence in Washington could ease their concerns . Another way to trim the deficit <p> A 1.0-percentage-point reduction in the CPI would help cut the federal budget deficit .
