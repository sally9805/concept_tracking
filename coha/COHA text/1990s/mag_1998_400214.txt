The 25 often-overlooked ways to stay healthy and injury-free. // These days you ca n't swing a soggy hiking sock without hitting a medical specialist . A glance at the Yellow Pages bears me out on this . There you 'll find lots of people with the letters " M " and " D " trailing their names , learned folks who spend their days focusing on one particular aspect of human health and well-being . But you have to search far and wide to find someone specializing in the field I 'll call " Preventive Wilderness Practices . " I know . I 've looked . And it 's a shame , too , because if more backwoods travelers spent time heading off trouble , instead of coping with it after the fact , the world would be a better place . While we all wait for the medical establishment to see the error of its ways and create such a specialty , you can get a jump on things . Here 's a rundown of the most important but easiest to forget health matters . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foray , and save yourself a trip to some specialist later on . Check your first  --  aid kit before every trip . Medications expire . Water , heat , or freezing cold can damage items . Or you may have used up some things ( bandages , for instance ) and forgotten to replace them , and you certainly do n't want to leave home without them . Some locales , say a desert where you 'll likely need to pluck a cactus spine or two , will require a few first-aid kit modifications from your recent trip to the mountains . Pack your medical supplies as thoughtfully as you pack your food and other equipment . Disinfect the bottle along with the water . Waterbased , gut-wrenching cooties can live in containers that appear dry . A rinse with boiling water will kill them , as will a thorough washing at home before the trip . And do n't forget to sanitize the lid because the screw-top rings are great places for bad bugs to hide . Be sure your sunglasses protect against ultra . violet light . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , down the road , cataracts . Not all sunglasses are rated according to the UV protection they provide , and some imports have inaccurate UV protection labels . When you buy , opt for high-quality eyewear from a reputable , widely recognized manufacturer , and make sure the glasses come with a written guarantee that spells out the protection . Or take your current pair to an optometrist or optical shop for a test of UV protection . The service is often free . Deink before you are thirsty . If your body is a mere 1 to 2 quarts low on water , an amount you can sweat out easily during an hour of hard hiking , your physical performance can drop as much as 25 percent . You 'll maintain endurance , and generally feel better , if you drink about1/4 quart of water every 15 to 20 minutes , instead of chugging at a rest break every hour or so . Stay slightly cold to stay warm . When sweat is evaporating from your body , the process sends precious body heat rushing into the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , do n't sweat as much and therefore , do n't waste body heat . You can stay slightly-but-not  --  uncomfortably cold by opening your clothing , removing outer layers , and maintaining a slower pace . Listen to body parts that tend to chafe . You know the places where moist skin rubs against moist skin , creating a painful rash . Carry a small bottle of talcum powder and apply three or four times a day to keep chafe-prone skin dry . Layers of clothing can act as " lubrication " where chafing is a recurring problem . Long cotton pants , for instance , can prevent chafed thighs . If that does n't work , you can always resort to a lubricating jelly . Use insect repellent safely . Although the Environmental Protection Agency approves only those repellents that pose no adverse effects to your health , there are several optional guidelines you should follow : 1 ) Read and follow label directions , and keep out of reach of small children . 2 ) Apply repellent only to exposed skin , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off as soon as you no longer need protection . 3 ) Do n't get repellent in your eyes , mouth , or open wounds . 4 ) If you must use it on children , do n't get any on their hands because chances are , it 'll end up being rubbed in eyes and mouth . Photograph // Note : DEET-based repellent will dissolve plastic , so carry it wrapped in a cotton bandanna and sealed in a plastic bag . Any that leaks out will stay in the bandanna , which can be worn later to help repel insects . Do a tick check . Ticks must bury their heads , then feed for hours or days before illness-causing germs can be passed to you . If you find one roaming , simply pick it off . If the head is buried , gently grip the tick at the skin line with a pair of tweezers and pull it out with steady pressure . Wash the site with soap and water to decrease the chance of illness . Apply sunscreen to your ears . Those flaps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often overlooked body parts-along with behind the ears and the lips-when hikers slather on sun protection lotion . They 're also prime spots for skin problems in later years . Sunscreens of SPF 15 will do the job for most skin types , but many dermatologists recommend SPF 30 to be safer . Shade from a wide-brimmed hat protects your ears , too . The brim should be at least 4 inches wide all the way around the hat . Baseball caps , sports fans , just wo n't do . Make sure your boots are in good shape . If your boots are broken down and provide no support for feet or ankles , you can develop tendonitis during only one day of hiking . And do n't try to lace ' em up extremely tight , hoping to compensate for the softness . Boots laced too tightly cause more blisters and tendonitis than boots laced too loosely . Photograph WARM UP EVERY MORNING . // And wear the right boots . Prevent frostbitten toes by wearing larger and/or cold-weather boots in winter . Sounds overly common-sensical , but frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on extra socks inside light boots to " make do " in an icy environment . Light boots do not provide enough insulation , and extra socks cut off circulation to the toes , which merely invites cold injury . Wash a wound to prevent rabies . Plain old soap kills the rabies virus , and water flushes the insidious germ from the wound . After being bitten by a wild animal , you 'd be wise to see a physician as soon as possible . Munch often to feel better . A snack about every 2 hours , especially a high carbohydrate snack , keeps your store of muscle glycogen high . Glycogen is converted into a sugar that fuels muscular work and liberates heat for inner warmth on a cold day . So do n't wait for that big , day's-end meal . Take advantage of this chance to eat often . Practice camp hygiene . Germs that make you sick are carried into the wilderness by your campmates . They 're not waiting in the tree bark to pounce on you . Do n't share personal kitchen gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorp around , ask everyone to pour some into their hands , instead of sticking grime-ridden paws into the bag . Always wash your hands after defecation and before preparing or eating food . Avoid short-nail syndrome . Yes , keep those toenails trimmed . Long toenails squashed into hiking boots can rip the flesh from a neighboring toe , rub painfully against the toebox of your boot ( and in some cases , collect blood underneath the nail , which then falls off a month or two later ) , and destroy your socks . But toenails that are too short can lead to problems , too . You need some length to protect the end of your toes while hiking . Also , they can become painfully ingrown on a long trip . Clean your fingernails . Clean hands rate as the number one way to prevent the spread of disease around camp , or anywhere , for that matter . That dark stuff collecting under your fingernails , sort of like a rich soil in your garden , is ideal for supporting germ growth . Even though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wash your hands . Photograph LIFT CORRECTLY . // Maintain your fitness to prevent injury . Staying in shape is the single best way to avoid a mishap or overuse injury on the trail . Hikers who are committed to a year-round fitness regimen are sidelined far less often than those who say , " I 'll get in shape on the trip . " Besides having more strength and endurance , the fit have less fat , and every extra pound you shed means less stress on joints and muscles , and-you guessed it ! - less chance of injury . Make sure your socks fit . Besides being a nuisance and uncomfortable , ill-fitting socks encourage blisters . Baggy socks form clumps of material that apply undue pressure to feet . Restrictive socks reduce healthy circulation and are usually stretched too far to maintain equal and adequate protection over your entire foot . Take precautions before a storm reaches you . Most lightning strikes hit people anywhere from 1 mile to as many as 7 miles in front of the clouds and rain . Remember : 5 seconds between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 mile away . Leave metal objects behind and move out of open spaces or away from shorelines . Head for uniform cover , such as trees of approximately the same height . Or get into a gully or ditch . Use a " third leg " to prevent injuries . You 're trudging along under a load over rough terrain when , oops , your foot turns , you lose balance , and down you go . A hiking staff-a trekking pole , a well-crafted wooden version , or simply a stout branch you pick up in the woods-not only helps you maintain balance , it also aids in stream crossings . There 's also the small matter of how it takes pressure off your knees . Visit a dentist before a big trip . Most dental problems , the painful kind that destroy a wilderness venture , can be discovered and repaired before the hurt starts . Take a wilderness medicine course . Besides learning life-saving techniques , such as CPR , you 'll also learn how to recognize and treat major and minor backpacking emergencies .

In addition to avoiding injury , stepping over something requires less energy than stepping up onto it . i Author Affiliation Contributing Editor Buck Tilton is the director of the Wilderness Medicine Institute located in Pitkin , Colorado , and author of Medicine for the Backcountry ( ICS Books , 800-541-7323 ) . // <p>
