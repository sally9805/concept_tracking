<p> In January 1989 , three young people from impoverished neighborhoods in New York City stepped off a prison bus at the Summit Shock Incarceration Facility in the Mohawk Mountains of Upstate New York , breathing in the fresh air and looking for a fresh start . Drugs had been the center of their lives : Drugs had made Christian Atwell a rich man , consoled Betty Rodriguez and transformed Terry Marion from an innocent boy to a con man . Along with a hundred youthful offenders like them , they were to purge themselves of a lifetime of negativity through six months of intensive military training and hard labor . <p> For the first time , they would lead regimented lives  --  get up at dawn for calisthenics and a mile run , work all morning at a lumberyard , attend afternoon counseling and academic sessions , partake of all meals in silence , speak only when spoken to and endure more physical training before lights out at 9 . <p> On that winter 's day five years ago , they had placed their hopes and dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each of them has discovered , change does n't come easily on the outside . <p> On the day he graduated from shock in June 1989 , Christian Atwell 's mother , father , grandmother , girlfriend and 11-month-old son , Chris Jr. , all came to cheer him on . " I was so proud and touched that day because I never completed anything in my life , " Atwell recalls . ( Indeed , a quarter of his classmates did n't finish the program . ) But what remained unobserved and unsaid during the celebration was that Atwell , who in his heyday drove a blue jeep through the South Bronx plying a drug trade that earned him $ 3,000 a day , was returning to the Bronx to a temporary , state-sponsored job that would pay him $ 20 a day . No one openly acknowledged how difficult it would be for him to resist the temptations . <p> " They sent us out on cleaning crews , " Atwell says . " I quit after two days . " When the parole officer gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to prison , Atwell quickly enrolled at a two-year college in Manhattan to study business management . <p> " School was nice . I made sure I went and went on time , " he says . " It was my plan to save up money and open my own barber shop/beauty salon . So I went to school every day . But I had no money . " <p> Atwell could n't stand the fact that he did n't have money to buy anything for himself , much less for his girlfriend , Lisa , and their toddler son . " So I went to a guy who I knew was selling and who I knew was a good guy I could trust . We talked about doing something together , " Atwell recalls . <p> " It was my choice to go back into the business , " he admits , " my choice . " <p> Before long , Atwell and his partner began taking the Greyhound bus to a suburb north of the city to sell crack cocaine . Business was so good that every weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd buy jewelry , clothes , gave Lisa money for my son . I took ' em out a lot , " Atwell says . " I did n't ever think to put any of it away because I never figured on getting locked up again . I thought if I needed more money it 'll come right back to me ' cause I could make it just as fast . " <p> Gradually , Atwell began skipping school and failed a few courses . His weekend business lasted a year and a half before he was arrested and charged with possession and sale of 100 capsules of crack . He faced 12 1/2 to 25 years in prison . After spending 11 months at Rikers Island , he agreed to a plea bargain of 4 1/2 to nine years . This time he was bound for prison , not shock camp . <p> " Prison was rough . Lots of guys had shanks and there were stabbings all the time , " Atwell says . " I wore a chain with a Mary medal and a guy cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was bleeding and had to go to the infirmary . Nothing happened to the guy . They asked me who did it but I knew enough not to tell . " <p> Ironically , Atwell , now 26 , claims to have been scared straight by his second brush with the law , and not by his experience at the shock camp . He earned a high school diploma in prison and participated in a voluntary substance abuse and counseling program . He is out on parole now and , through the help of his stepfather , has a clerical job that pays more than minimum wage . <p> " Yeah , shock taught me how to get up and get to work on time , but it was a lot of yelling and exercise , " Atwell says . " They never got inside people 's heads . " <p> All shock camps nationally are built on the military model , with emphasis on discipline and a large dose of humiliation , in the belief that tougher prisons can shock young criminals into shape . <p> With public outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready-made for a conservative era of getting tough on crime . The twin goals of the camps are to relieve prison overcrowding and to quickly reform young offenders . But how effective are they ? <p> There are some 47 shock camps operating in 27 states and two in the Federal Bureau of Prisons  --  one in Lewisburg , Pa. , and another in Bryan , Tex . New York boasts the largest program , accounting for nearly 30 percent of all inmates in shock facilities . ( Maryland has been operating the 260-bed Herman Toulson Correctional Boot Camp in Jessup since 1990 , graduating 1,447 inmates to date . ) <p> In New York , in lieu of their sentences , inmates spend 180 days in shock , the longest stay of any program in the country . According to New York State Department of Correctional Services figures , the roughly 9,000 shock graduates to date have saved the state an estimated $ 305 million in custody and capital costs . <p> However , shock programs so far have not achieved their second goal of reducing the rate of recidivism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Institute of Justice concluded that the recidivism rates of shock graduates are comparable to those of the general prison population . <p> New York has fared better , according to an evaluation done by the state 's Division of Parole , which shows statistically significant reductions in recidivism within the first two years of a shock graduate 's release as compared with a regular parolee . ( Ten percent of shock graduates were returned in the first year , vs. 16 percent for regular parolees . ) <p> However , the recidivism rates for shock graduates and regular parolees in New York become almost identical at four years out  --  55 percent of shock graduates were returned to prison compared with 56 percent of regular parolees . <p> The early improvement in return rates , studies show , are attributable to the drug counseling component of the program and after-shock treatment . <p> Of the 89 inmates who graduated with Atwell , Marion and Rodriguez from Summit Shock five years ago , 44 have been returned to prison . The other 45 have stayed out of jail , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shock incarceration in New York , points out that there are only about 500 shock graduates who are four years out . " It 's too early to extrapolate anything from those figures , " she says . <p> New York is committed to shock , says Clark , who notes that during a five-year period the state has gone from operating one 250-bed facility to four facilities graduating some 3,000 inmates a year . The expansion is largely due to the state legislature 's recognition of shock 's ability to save bed space and money . As for the rehabilitative potential of shock , she says , " like any program , you ca n't expect the results from six months of shock to last over a lifetime . " <p> Terry Marion <p> When Terry Marion got off the Department of Corrections bus that took him from Summit Shock to a New York City bus terminal in June 1989 , his plan was to lock himself up in his aunt 's Brooklyn apartment and never go out . It was the only way he knew to stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock was how to fold my socks and keep myself clean , " Marion , now 24 , says . " They did nothing with your emotions . Making us break down and cry is not dealing with our emotions . They did n't give me what I need to survive in the street , how to use my intelligence and not let my anger take over . They should have gave us school and counseling eight hours a day instead of all that exercising . " <p> Marion had lived with his aunt ever since his mother became ill when he was 3 years old . He does n't know what happened to his father . When Marion returned home from shock , he found that his aunt , who had been a nurse , could no longer work and was subsisting on disability income . The money Marion made as a minimum-wage messenger had to help pay rent . <p> Relations between them became strained  --  his aunt was frustrated by her disability and Marion felt trapped . " When I got home from shock , things seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes deep back into my childhood . I was tired of feeling that type of pain . So , I started drinking and doing cocaine to medicate my emotions . When I 'm full of alcohol , it makes me act violent . It makes me want to be the tough and mean person that I 'm not . " <p> Just 68 days after returning home , he violated parole . By his admission , the violations involved stupid things  --  fighting with someone in the neighborhood and riding in a stolen automobile  --  but he lost all of his determination to stay on the straight and narrow . <p> Between 1990 and 1992 , Marion returned to prison on three occasions , all involving some type of physical violence . He is currently incarcerated at a medium-security facility , serving a two-to-four-year sentence for robbery , an incident in which he was stabbed in the abdomen and required eight stitches . <p> Marion is eligible for parole in April . This past July , his aunt died . Although he is working toward a high school diploma , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he 'll go when he is paroled . <p> " The desire to stay clean and out of jail is strong in me now , " he writes in a letter from his cell . " I want a piece of that old American dream , being a family man , going to work and not worrying about where my next meal is coming from or if the next person I steal from is going to be the one to kill me . I know now , everything is self-help . " <p> Although New York 's shock program follows the military model , it is one of the few that provides professional and peer counseling , drug treatment and academic education , in addition to 500 hours of compulsory physical training . In the past year , Maryland has begun to incorporate occupational programs and to reinforce drug treatment in its boot camp , says Len Sipes , spokesman for the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services . <p> The National Institute of Justice study found that in shock programs providing treatment and education , graduates leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strictly military atmosphere . <p> Stephen Chinlund , an Episcopal minister who has worked with inmates for more than 30 years and who now runs an after-shock program in New York City that provides weekly group meetings and counseling , has been preaching the therapeutic approach to rehabilitation since the 1960s . " Physical training is fine but there should be no shouting and degradation . That is just a recapitulation of parental abuse , of the shame and failure " that already pervades young offenders ' psyches , he says . " They need reinforcement of what is good about themselves . They need affirmation . " <p> However , Chinlund observes , there is much resistance to this philosophy because " people see it as coddling criminals " and because some prison policy makers see the system as a factory where criminals are brought in and then turned out . " The resolve is not there to rehabilitate , " Chinlund says . " They do n't give a damn . " <p> Edward Koren , staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at both ends of the political spectrum . The military-style discipline appeals to those on the right , while the left applauds the drug treatment aspect . He noted that part of the money in the recent federal crime bill allocated to the states will be used by some of the states to build more boot camps . <p> Betty Rodriguez <p> Betty Rodriguez was never so happy as the day she graduated from shock . She had earned a high school diploma and felt mentally and physically fit , " ready to take on the world , " she thought . For the first time in many years , she was not dependent on the heroin that had helped her through bouts of severe depression . Her two attempts at suicide on Rikers Island seemed like a lifetime ago . But when Rodriguez went home to her grandmother 's apartment in a South Bronx housing project , she quickly realized that she had more than herself to take care of . Something was wrong with her 8-year-old son . <p> " Clarence was so insecure . He was biting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause he was afraid I would leave him again , " Rodriguez says . The boy had n't forgotten that his mother had told him she would be right back just before she was arrested for robbing a grocery in 1988 . Nearly a year had passed before he saw her again on visiting day at the camp . " He begged to sleep with me in my bed , " Rodriguez recalls . " My grandmother said that was no good , but I let him because I was on a guilt trip . " <p> As a condition of her release from shock , Rodriguez had to find a job and attend drug counseling sessions three nights a week . She quickly found work at a hardware store , but only by not telling the owner she was a parolee . Rodriguez made $ 275 a week doing inventory , placing orders for nails , hammers and paints . " I had my own office , it was a little room but it was mine , " she says proudly . " I was doing a responsible job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , Rodriguez missed some of the mandatory counseling sessions . She explained this to her parole officer , who came unannounced to the hardware store one day to verify her excuse . When the parole officer identified herself to the owner , Rodriguez was promptly fired . <p> She had to find another job within two weeks or be in violation of parole . Luckily , Rodriguez found a $ 5-an-hour job as a cashier in a clothing store . " Parole was satisfied that I was working no matter how little it paid , " Rodriguez says . " They did n't care how much I was making as long as I was working . They did n't care that I did n't have enough time for my son . All my money went to help my grandmother pay bills . On the weekends I 'd help her with chores and laundry . I know I neglected Clarence . " <p> Clarence became more demanding of his mother 's attention , refusing to go to school and openly disobeying his great-grandmother . " He waited up for me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go to school unless I took him myself . I could n't skip counseling and I could n't be late for work . I felt so frustrated because everything I wanted to do I could n't do . A few times I cried on my grandmother 's shoulder because I was scared . I did n't know how much more I could take of it . I was starting to think : If I broke the law , the chance of going to jail was 50-50 . I had to do something . " <p> One day , a relative of Rodriguez came home from prison having served time for armed robbery . " His attitude was , ' To hell with parole , I 'm going to make as much money as I can , ' " Rodriguez recalls . " One thing I have to say about shock , it gave me a better attitude on life , though it did n't last long . " <p> But his words lingered in Rodriguez 's head . " He kept saying to me : ' What you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , ' " she says . <p> Rodriguez , now 31 , was arrested in October 1993 and accused of robbing a Bronx jewelry store . She faces a minimum of 6 years in prison if convicted , according to her lawyer , and has been living at Rikers Island since her arrest . She gave birth in jail to a baby girl , whom she named Zana . In a telephone call home , Rodriguez 's grandmother told her that since she has been away , Clarence , now 14 , has become completely unmanageable . Then , Rodriguez says , her grandmother lowered the boom : The boy was arrested for selling crack to an undercover cop and has been taken to a juvenile detention center .
