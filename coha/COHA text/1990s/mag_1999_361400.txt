Some life ! The execrable megapornographer Sade , who gave weird sex a bad name , is here the subject of revisionist treatment the thrust of which is that he had an enormous talent for wielding his pen as prodigiously as his penis . Since depravity was " natural , " Sade argued , it must be irreproachable . Sade 's notorious The 120 Days of Sodom , a revolting account of orgiastic activity combining the sexual with all varieties of bodily functions , is thus deemed " a transcendent , darkly sublime novel . " Schaeffer 's earnestly pedantic and repetitive paean is so numbing that only a masochist would enjoy it . <P>  --  By Jesse Birnbaum
