TWICE EACH YEAR BAHAMANIANS STAGE AN EXUBERANT CELEBRATION ROOTED IN TRADITION <p> RIO DE JANEIRO may have its ' Carnival , and New Orleans its Mardi Gras , but m the Bahamas , there is Junkanoo , a pulsating festival that erupts on two days each year  --  Boxing Day ( December 26 ) and New Year 's Day , Tradition has decreed that the festival take place on these two days , with so-called normal life in between . But if you attend the first Junkanoo parade , you might well imagine that the revelers need five full days to recover and recharge their physical and spiritual energies . <p> Junkanoo is second to none when it comes to hypnotic music and frenetic dancing , with marchers attired in wildly colorful papier mache costumes . A people 's festival in the true sense of the word , Junkanoo has been celebrated for centuries in small towns on what the tourism officials now call the " Family Islands . " On these Out Islands of the Bahamas-places like Eleuthera and Andros  --  tourism is minimal and the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxically , one finds the largest and most exciting Junkanoo celebration of all in Nassau , the capital city on the island of New Providence . In this crowded tourist mecca , chockablock with high-rise hotels , narrow streets are filled with visitors newly debarked from the cruise ships that call with clockwork regularity throughout the year . Nassau boasts the largest straw market in the islands and on Bay Street , the main drag , dozens of merchants sell Rolex watches and Chanel perfume to tourists . Yet despite this commercialization , the Bahamian spirit thrives . For two days a year , the island people return to their roots with a festival that marks them as nationals and celebrates their uniqueness in the Americas . <p> Although often compared to Rio 's carnival , Junkanoo more closely resembles the Brazilian festival of Iemanja . Not only do both take place on New Year 's day , but both are steeped in tribal traditions . In Rio , thousands of worshippers make offerings to the sea goddess Iemanja at the water 's edge . It is a powerful , emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a considerably more secular fireworks display . <p> Junkanoo 's origins are less obviously religious . An African-derived celebration , it harkens back to the early colonial history of the Bahamas when slavery was a way of life . Slaves were expected to work throughout the year including Christmas Day . In compensation they were " free " on both Boxing and New Year 's Day . The slaves used these days not to rest but to celebrate . More importantly , this was a time to recall their African ancestors and ancestral traditions . <p> Scholars have traced Junkanoo 's beginnings to practices of the Yoruba Egungun cult , a secret society of " masqueraders " within the larger Yoruba community . Led by a hereditary chief called Alagba , cult members wore elaborate costumes and masks made of cloth and leather . Some fashioned fanciful headdresses with carvings representing the spirit of an ancestor or other religious symbols . These customs were kept alive by tribe members when they were taken to the Bahamas as slaves . <p> As to the origin of the word Junkanoo , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a corruption of the name " John Canoe , " a legendary African king . The second and more plausible linguistically , is that Junkanoo is a literal translation of " Gensinconnu , " a Yoruba word meaning " a masked individual . " <p> Over time , the original religious meaning of Junkanoo has been obscured , at least to outsiders , by the festive nature of the celebration . The costumes have changed subtly in terms of design and materials used  --  cloth and leather have been replaced by paper . The inclusion of clowns , acrobats and dancers on stilts has added another dimension to the celebration . <p> On New Year 's Day , festivities begin before dawn when most revelers around the world have taken their weary heads to the sanctuary of their beds . In Nassau , the celebratory midnight hour seems like a quaint colonial touch . " Okay , blow those noisemakers , drink that champagne , " say the Bahamians with a smile . " You have n't seen anything yet , Mon . " The real party is at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of whom will be marching in these early hours , to don their costumes and paint their faces . By three a.m. a few wildly costumed people can be seen heading for the start of the parade along Bay Street . The locals begin to find their own favorite spots and by four thirty , the crowd is so thick that one can move only with great difficulty . It is more comfortable to view the parade on Shirley Street , one block away . <p> The entire Junkanoo parade is propelled by a musical back beat of cowbells , whistles , conch shells and Goombay drums made of goatskin stretched over a wooden frame and heated to the desired tension . Noisemakers wearing garish costumes of papier mache and crepe paper and extravagant headdresses sway and dance in groups both small and large . The rhythms a are intoxicating . <p> Colorful floats punctuate the Junkanoo parade , such as the one for Peanuts Taylor 's Drumbeat Club . Peanuts Taylor owns the most popular nightclub in town , and the large , papier mache figure of Mr. Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an actual basketball back board and net over his head , " Love , " " Unity , " and " Bahamas Games " are written across his costume . The noise increases and approaches to deafening as each new marching band passes . These groups compete for prizes during the Boxing and the New Year 's Day parades . Although the same marchers participate in both parades , they wear different costumes . Judging of the individual groups takes place around 8 a.m. , an hour before the celebration winds down . <p> Unlike other carnivals in the Hemisphere , Junkanoo has remained relatively uncorrupted by tourism and has maintained its unique flavor . The focus is on the parade , not the spectators and the overwhelming majority of participants and viewers are Bahamians . Furthermore , the spectators do not , as a rule , dress up . They observe , applaud their favorite Junkanoo groups , and get caught up in the excitement . This is a refreshing exception in this day of feasts and festivals that have been mercilessly hyped by the publicity merchants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations nightmare for the Bahamians . If you plan to attend either Junkanoo parade this year , you should make your hotel and air fare arrangements early . Hotels have grown so crowded during this season that the Bahamian Ministry of Tourism now routinely makes radio announcements in Nassau urging residents to open up guest rooms in their homes to provide additional space for late arrivals . <p> Those who are fortunate enough to experience Junkanoo will come away with a greater appreciation for this centuries-old tradition and for the Bahamian spirit of joy and pride in their heritage . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bay Street Jumps with a parade of floats and wildly attired masqueraders competing for Festival prizes <p> BY EVERETT POTTER <p> <p> Everett Potter writes a nationally syndicated weekly travel column for The New York Times Syndicate .
