<p> FIRST OF TWO PARTS <p> George Bush , standing beside his battered Kennebunkport home and surveying the wreckage wrought by a fierce Atlantic storm , was momentarily humbled by the awesome force of nature . " The sea , " he had to concede , " won this round . " <p> But like countless victims of countless other disasters , the presi dent was not about to admit defeat . He would rebuild , he vowed , and the imposing stone-and- shingle house would again occupy its rocky promontory overlooking the roiling sea . <p> The scene last month easily evoked the kind of grit and perseverance that Americans expect from their presidents . But it also betrayed another side to the national character  --  an almost defiant attitude toward the powers of earth , sea and sky that puts the United States at ever-increasing risk of natural disaster . <p> Although tougher building codes , space-age satellites and swifter warning systems may lend a heightened sense of security , such advances are heavily outweighed by a continued migration to the coasts , where the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods , earthquakes and other " acts of God " has climbed steadily for nearly 20 years . Yet it is only a matter of luck that the losses are not higher , experts say , and it is only a matter of time before the nation is struck by a disaster unlike any it has ever experienced . <p> " We could go a few decades with modest losses of life and periodic economic losses in the low billions , as we saw with hurricane Hugo , the Loma Prieta earthquake and the East Bay fire , " said Stephen Rattien , who oversees disaster research at National Academy of Sciences . <p> " But at any moment , we could be hit with an event causing thousands of deaths and economic damages as high as $ 100 billion  --  unless we are better prepared , " said Rattien . " Over time , the probability of such an event is high . And right now we are not well prepared . " <p> That event  --  a major quake on the Hayward Fault , for instance  --  would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could overwhelm the insurance industry , topple banks and send shock waves through the economy . <p> " A lot of companies would go broke . It would be a major financial disaster as well as a physical disaster , " said Donald Segraves , executive director of the Insurance Research Council , which has produced studies supporting the industry 's push for national earthquake insurance backed by the U.S. Treasury . <p> CULTURAL , ECONOMIC FORCES <p> Projections of rising risk stem in part from new scientific discoveries of hazards previously unknown . More important , however , are cultural and economic forces that lead people to build and rebuild in risk-prone areas and government policies that put more emphasis on responding to disaster than preventing it : <p> * Although earthquakes are virtually synonymous with California , which leads the nation in disaster preparedness , scientists now warn that millions of people are also at risk in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest , where the whole notion of seismic safety is still in its infancy . <p> * Population has soared along the hurricane belt running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Maine . And after two decades of relative calm , experts studying global weather patterns anticipate a new surge in hurricane activity , bringing storms that could do $ 15 billion damage to a city such as Miami or New Orleans . <p> * Even after disaster strikes , efforts to steer development away from harm often prove futile . After hurricane Hugo wiped out 160 oceanfront homes in South Carolina , protests and lawsuits forced the repeal of a law that would have barred owners from rebuilding just a few dozen feet from the surf . Another debate over post-disaster building restrictions is now taking shape in the fire-ravaged East Bay hills . <p> * Government subsidies , in some cases , only make matters worse . Federal flood insurance helps encourage building in risky coastal areas , and after a storm hits , disaster relief funds can be the shot in the arm that turns a quiet seaside community into a teeming resort . <p> Politically , it is easy to understand why natural disasters are low on the agenda , particularly in an era of shrinking budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Tubbesing , director of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in Oakland . " Today 's problems are poverty and drugs and crime . And we 're faced with those on a daily basis . " <p> But in the long run , insisted Tubbesing , that approach is penny wise and pound foolish . " We either spend now or spend a helluva lot more later . People always hope the spending later wo n't come on their watch . They 'll be safely out of office , and it 'll be somebody else 's problem . " <p> PSYCHOLOGICAL AVERSION <p> The basis for refusing to confront natural disaster before it happens may simply be a normal psychological aversion for that which is frightening and seemingly far off . <p> " There 's a certain ostrich-like behavior , " said Rattien at the National Academy of Sciences . " We tend to write off events whose probability is not too great , and we regret it when they do occur . But for the most part , we assume it 's going to happen to the other guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wealth in places where they are most at risk . <p> On the wall of her office at Red Cross regional headquarters in Burlingame , Peggy Brutsche has hung a sobering map that uses shadings and stripes to tell where the hazards are the greatest . <p> " The highest earthquake risk , of course , is up the West Coast , " said Brutsche , who has led disaster preparedness programs around the country . " The highest hurricane risk is along the Gulf Coast and the East Coast . And up the Mississippi River is where you have the greatest tornado risk and the New Madrid Fault . People have certainly concentrated toward the areas of highest risk . " <p> Nowhere is that more striking than in Florida , where there are twice as many people today as there were 20 years ago , and most have gravitated to the water 's edge . <p> " Clearly , Florida is the most susceptible state in the country to the risk of a hurricane , " said Bob Nave , chief of the state 's Division of Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of them live in counties along the coast . There are billions and billions of dollars of property at risk . " <p> So far , said Nave , " Florida has been extremely fortunate . It 's been several decades since we 've been hit by a killer storm like Hugo or anything close . " <p> CHANGE IN THE WEATHER <p> The luck may soon run out . <p> Meteorologists believe hurricanes are driven in part by heavy rainfall in the Sahel region of central Africa . The region is just now coming out of a long drought , perhaps presaging a new surge in East Coast storms . What is more , some contend , global warming could set off atmospheric changes producing far more powerful storms , packing winds up to 225 miles per hour . <p> " We 've been in a real lull in hurricane activity , " said Bob Sheets , who directs the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Weather Service in Coral Gables , Fla . " The indications are we are going to return to more hurricane activity within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after . " <p> The worst disaster in U.S. history was caused by a hurricane that swept through Galveston , Texas , in 1900 , killing more than 6,000 people , 10 times the number of deaths caused by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 . <p> The most destructive hurricane in recent times was Hugo in 1989 , which killed 49 and caused $ 7 billion in damage , a toll that would have been far worse if the storm had not struck a relatively uninhabited stretch of coast . If it had hit Miami , experts calculate , the damage would have been $ 15 billion or more . <p> DILEMMA FOR FLORIDA KEYS <p> The problem for disaster planners is how to evacuate large coastal cities or places such as the Florida Keys  --  where nearly 200,000 people may be found during the peak of the tourist season and where there is only one road out . <p> " Where we used to be fairly confident we could get people out of harm 's way in 12 hours , that 's just not true in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricanes with radar and planes and issues evacuation warnings . " In some places you 'd have to warn as much as 48 hours beforehand . " <p> Sheets has no trouble understanding how so many people wound up living in the path of danger . " Has it entered into the minds of the people living on the San Andreas Fault ? The answer is no . It 's a pleasant place to live , people want to be at the water . These are rare events , and it never happens to me . That 's the kind of attitude most people have . " <p> Often , that attitude is reinforced by government subsidy . Although the National Flood Insurance Program has helped reduce risk in many places by mandating stronger building codes along some stretches of the coast , " there would not be a lot of building if it were not for the flood insurance , " said Sheets . <p> Then when an area is wiped out , the inevitable infusion of relief money can be a catalyst for development that puts more people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1979 , after hurricane Frederick virtually destroyed Gulf Shores , a small town on the Alabama coast , disaster recovery funds paid for new water and sewer systems that paved the way for a booming tourist trade . Now more than 100 condominium complexes line the shore . <p> " It was like an urban renewal program out there , " said Sheets . " And that kind of thing takes place almost any place you 've had a big hurricane strike . " <p> A similar pattern has followed in hurricane Hugo 's wake . <p> A year before the hurricane , the South Carolina legislature enacted a tough law restricting building and rebuilding along the coast . " Right after Hugo , there were calls for a special legislative session to repeal the law , " said Tim Beatley , who studies post-Hugo reconstruction as an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of Virginia . <p> Although much of the statute survived , the toughest provision , which barred construction in a 20- foot " dead zone " near the water 's edge , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " in many cases there 's more at risk now than there was before the storm . " <p> Sandy Ragin , who lost his house and everything else when Hugo swept across Pawleys Island south of Myrtle Beach , built his new home higher and stronger so that it will fare better when the next storm hits . But one way or another , he was determined to rebuild . <p> " I do n't believe in taking a risk at all . If they blow the sirens , I 'll be the first one in line coming off the island , " said the 50-year-old forester . " But I worked all my life to get here . I just do n't want to walk away . " <p> QUAKE RISKS IN MIDWEST <p> Elsewhere around the country , the risk of natural disaster is just as real , if not so obvious . <p> In the Midwest , despite a swarm of earthquakes in the early 1800s believed to be of magnitude 8.0 or greater , it was only with research started in the 1970s that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Madrid Fault could devastate an area where 12 million people live . <p> And it was not until last year  --  after a reclusive genius named Iben Browning set off panic with his false prediction of a major quake  --  that several states got around to adopting seismic building codes . <p> The region is far behind California in earthquake preparedness , and much of it is built on layer upon layer of old river bed , making it even more vulnerable . <p> " Local geology transmits earthquake energy very , very efficiently , " said Jill Stevens of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at Memphis State University . " In large parts of this region , we have soil conditions very similar to those in the Marina District ( of San Francisco ) . So our 6.5 could be your magnitude 7.1 . " <p> Seismologists estimate that there is a 40 percent to 63 percent chance of a magnitude 6.0 quake along the New Madrid Fault in the next 15 years . <p> In the Pacific Northwest , where there is also considerable evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of a major quake , preparations are a bit further along . Still , the pleas of safety advocates frequently fall on deaf ears . <p> " Sometimes I feel like I 'm talking to 20-year-olds about retirement plans . People sort of drift away , " said Linda Noson , who spent eight years as state geologist in Washington and now advises private firms on earthquake safety . <p> " People seem to count on Yankee ingenuity  --  when it happens we 'll pull it out , " said Noson . " Unfortunately , when you 're underneath a brick wall , it 's sort of tough to pull it out . " <p> For thousands of years  --  since prehistoric clans settled along rivers only to discover that they periodically overflowed their banks  --  humans have ascribed natural disaster to fate or the gods . <p> In the modern world , that attitude is reflected in a greater tolerance for natural hazards than for technological hazards such as nuclear power plants or toxic dumps , even when the experts say nature is the larger threat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prevented while acts of God can not , " said sociologist E. L. Quarantelli at the University of Delaware 's Disaster Research Center . <p> " But that perception is changing , " said Quarantelli . " People are less inclined to accept the notion that God is responsible . They want to know why are they allowed to live in flood plains , why are buildings built in such a way that they 'll collapse in an earthquake . " <p> It is yet to be seen whether this shift in thinking will translate into a new willingness to attune human activity to nature 's unpredictable yet immutable forces . " Nature is not to be controlled , " said Rattien at the National Academy of Sciences . " It 's our behavior in the face of nature that has to be controlled . " <p> TOMORROW <p> Although earthquakes pose financial risks that run into the billions , few communities have systematically assessed the costs and benefits of being better prepared , leaving many exposed to staggering economic losses when catastrophe strikes .
