<p> It was gold . <p> It was religion . <p> It was better than snake oil . <p> Denver International Airport , as its promoters portrayed it nearly a decade ago , was supposed to make the city great again . <p> They said it would be the largest , busiest and most technologically advanced airport on the planet . The jobs it produced , by some accounts , would number in the hundreds of thousands . <p> It would become the " Gateway to the West , " an inland port that would spawn in its environs a " vibrant festival marketplace " of office buildings and industrial parks covering an area potentially twice the size of Denver itself . <p> Some boosters ventured it would promote racial harmony in the city and make life better for the elderly . <p> The reality so far is a little different . When DIA opens , it will likely be only the sixth busiest in the country , never mind the world . Some of the technology does n't fully work yet . It will employ the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , definite development plans include just a pair of hotels , though economic development officials say there is talk of more . <p> In the frenzy of promotional enthusiasm that sold Denver International to the public in the middle and late 1980s , many things were said that may never come true . And as DIA 's fifth and last scheduled opening approaches , many have already turned out to be wrong . <p> Consider these : <p> Jobs . A 1986 study said that DIA would produce 41,000 jobs in 1995 . When the airport opens , it will employ between 21,000 and 23,000 directly and produce about another 13,000 indirectly . That 's about the same as Stapleton a decade ago . <p> Flight traffic . The city predicted 52 million passengers would tread DIA 's polished granite floors in 1995 . The actual number of passengers estimated to come through Denver in 1995 is 32 million - fewer than at Stapleton in 1987 . <p> Gates . DIA was supposed to have at least 120 gates when it opened and a total of 206 by 2020 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 111 gates . <p> Runways . DIA was supposed to have six runways , one of them large enough to accommodate the landing requirements of certain international flights . DIA has only five because the long international runway has been sacrificed , at least for now . <p> Cost . In 1988 , the Greater Denver Corporation , economic development arm of the chamber of commerce , said construction costs would total $ 1.4 billion with $ 1 billion of it likely to be paid by the federal government . Construction totals so far add up to at least $ 3.2 billion . Denver eventually asked the federal government for $ 500 million , but some of that money may be held up by the House Appropriations Committee . Total cost of DIA is now pegged at $ 4.9 billion . <p> Fees . Per-passenger costs were supposed be around $ 7 per person for flying through DIA . When airlines objected to the city 's projections in the late 1980s , saying the fees could grow beyond $ 8 a passenger , aviation director George Doughty said that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $ 18.80 a passenger , and could go higher . <p> Baggage handling . DIA 's automatic baggage system was supposed to deliver luggage at a rate of 60 bags a minute to all three concourses . When the airport first opens , because of interminable glitches in the system , it 's been programmed to deliver luggage half as fast , to only one concourse and mostly in only one direction . For the time being , two concourses will be served by the traditional low-tech " tug and cart " system . <p> Most of the failed forecasts were made during the administration of former Mayor Federico Pena , who conceived the airport and once planned to build it even if no major airline officially agreed to use it . <p> DIA was a **27;808;TOOLONG dream that some say will one day be vindicated . But for now , the financially troubled airport is a public-relations crisis for Pena 's successor , Wellington Webb , on whose watch the airport - with all its construction glitches - was built . <p> THE <p> SNAKE OIL <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stand he took during his first mayoral campaign to expand Stapleton . He 'd argued the old airport could n't handle the flights flooding Stapleton . And he 'd nailed an agreement with Adams County to build what he said would be the world 's busiest airport on 53 square miles of Adams County land , which would be annexed by Denver . <p> With new urgency , he stood before business leaders and members of the Denver City Council . In his hand was an inch-thick spiral-bound book whose contents in the coming years would form Denver 's motto , its slogan , its religion : Jobs . <p> The book was a study , commissioned by the city for $ 125,000 . The study concluded a new airport would create 41,000 jobs by 1995 . By 2010 , the city could expect 54,000 jobs . That meant millions in taxes , billions in personal income and revenue . More , if you counted the increase in tourism and industry the study predicted a new airport would bring . <p> " This report is so astounding , " Pena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a way to build this airport faster than 1993 . " <p> Pena ordered his airport staff to begin planning a completion date as early as 1990 . Skeptics called the plan an impossibility , but Pena said it had to be be done . <p> It was that decision - to build the airport as fast as possible , designing it on the run - that would lead to many of the construction-related problems at DIA . But Pena did not see that in 1986 when the steamroller began . <p> It 's hard now to fathom the resonance Pena 's words had in 1986 . They fell on the ears of people who had been blindsided by one of the most catastrophic economic wrecks in Colorado history . <p> For a decade , oil , S &L; money and rampant land speculation had made Denver rich . Money brought glitz and a spot on the map . The likes of Henry Kissinger and former President Gerald Ford jetted to Denver to attend oil billionaire Marvin Davis ' annual Carousel Ball . <p> When the crash came , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the late ' 80s , Denver had the highest downtown office vacancy rate in the country . Davis and his ball moved to Los Angeles . Real estate loans rotted in the portfolios of every major bank in the city , giving Colorado the nation 's worst bank performance for two years running . <p> The airport suddenly took on new meaning . It was bigger and more important than the mere facts of its original conception - a place to land more planes . Now , in the minds of many , building it was a matter not of prosperity but of survival . <p> " The airport was supposed to change everything , " Charles Hull , a former vice president of Colorado National Bankshares told The Denver Post . " I remember what everybody was saying : We need a world-class airport to have a world-class city . " <p> In the months before Adams County voters were to decide the airport question in a May 1988 referendum , they were pummelled with advertisements that stressed the county 's 9.3 percent unemployment rate . One mailing showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " He 's running out of time . " <p> When Adams County voters arrived at the polls , they again were hit with the urgent importance of their votes . Their ballots , citing the report that Pena had flashed before the city council two years before , said : " Studies have shown that the significant economic activity resulting from the construction and operation of the new airport should generate substantial net increases in county , city and school district revenues . " <p> In the heat of battle , airport promoters descended into hyperbole , making claims that now have decayed to irony . In a newsletter produced by the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce shortly before the Adams County election , Robert Scanlan , then the regional manager of Coldwell Banker gushed , " The day we open our new airport - one that could be the second-busiest in the world - is the day that Denver becomes the Gateway to the West as well as the Gateway to the World . " <p> And there was this from Robert Albin , president of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport , we 'll experience a resurgance of optimism , with renewed faith in public and private leadership . The new airport will be a showcase project , a fine example of how things should be accomplished . " <p> Behind the bombast lurked real urgency for some , especially speculators who owned land or options on land close to the airport . <p> Denver homebuilder M.D.C. Holdings had begun in 1984 to amass land and options in and around the area that would ultimately become the airport site . By 1987 , M.D.C. had purchased or acquired options on 877 acres near the airport site . <p> Real estate partnerships controlled by Silverado Banking Savings and Loan , the Denver thrift where former President Bush 's son Neil was a director , also were buying land in the vicinity . So were some of Silverado 's biggest borrowers , such as then-Denver developer Bill Walters . <p> In all , Silverado invested $ 70 million in airport land through loans and acquisitions through its real estate partnerships . <p> One parcel Silverado bought , a 39-acre dry wheat farm called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years , almost tripling in value from $ 1.5 million to $ 4.3 million . M.D.C. has said it had no hidden intentions in buying the land as did Silverado , which failed in December 1988 at a cost of $ 1 billion . And an investigation by Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton found no wrongdoing . <p> Still , the heavy investments might help explain why Silverado recruited its employees to campaign for the airport in the Adams County election , shipping some of them in buses out to canvas neighborhoods . <p> In the fall of 1986 - weeks before Pena announced the speed-up at DIA - M.D.C. 's Larry Mizel met with the mayor and advised just such a fast track . Until then , Pena had called for a DIA opening some time between 1993 and 1995 . <p> Mizel - a large Pena campaign contributor - explained that he wanted the quick schedule not for his benefit but for Denver 's . Pena said his decision to hurry the project had nothing to do with Mizel or any other land owner . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> THE RELIGION <p> After the steamroller began , voices in opposition seemed distant and sometimes hollow . Amid the promotional frenzy that surrounded a campaign to win voter approval of DIA , some important people questioned the project . Former Gov . Dick Lamm said it would cause global warming . Former Denver Mayor Bill McNichols said in his only public statement about the airport that it was " a mirage " and that " it is an unfortunate thing when people embrace a fleeting picture painted in the sky . " <p> McNichols was ignored . As for others who were against the airport , Gov . Romer said at a news conference in 1989 that he would " crush " them . <p> Romer later conceded it was an insensitive thing to say . But it turned out to be true . In the years preceding the airport 's completion , many opponents were crushed or at least silenced . <p> Mike Bell , a former senior vice president at the Denver investment banking house Boettcher &; Co. , wrote a financial analysis that suggested the city could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pena and airport officials , who said they wanted the memo suppressed and computer files destroyed . The company agreed not to make the memo public , and Bell eventually left Denver . <p> Denver 's media were n't immune from the hype , either . The Denver Post gave thousands to the Greater Denver Corp . ' s pro-airport campaign , and there developed what former Sunday managing editor Al Knight called " a growing tension " between the paper 's publisher and the newsroom , which had been publishing critical stories . <p> In spring 1989 , the Post 's airport reporter wrote a story saying drive times to the new airport would be longer than the city claimed . The Denver Chamber 's Dick Fleming put pressure on the Post 's then-publisher Maurice Hickey not to run the story . Knight said he fought successfully to get it in the paper . <p> When it finally ran , Denver 's director of aviation George Doughty " went ballistic , " and called for a meeting with Post editors , Knight said . <p> Doughty complained of the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And after the meeting , Knight lost his job as managing editor and went to the editorial page . Publisher Hickey as well as The Post 's editor at the time subsequently have left the paper . Though the paper 's editorial position remained firmly behind the airport , critical reports in its news pages continued , said Post Executive Editor Neil Westergaard . <p> Critics at the Federal Aviation Administration also were pressured . The agency was convinced in the early 1980s that expanding Stapleton was the most efficient and cost-effective way to handle rising air traffic in Denver , said Walt Barbo , retired head of the FAA 's Denver office . So it approved and funded construction of a new runway . <p> When Denver changed its mind and decided to go for a new airport , the office went along . In spring 1987 , Denver officials submitted a required environmental impact statement , which was supposed to evaluate six sites and choose the best among them . <p> Denver 's report mostly ignored all but one , Barbo said . <p> FAA officials in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muster . City officials were furious , Barbo said , and instead of redoing the report , Denver argued it did n't need to do any more to prove the site it chose was the best . <p> At first , the FAA stuck to its guns . Despite enormous pressure from city officials and Colorado 's congressional delegation , it issued a statement saying , " Nothing in that letter has changed . " <p> But after meeting again the next day with then-Colorado Sen. Bill Armstrong , the FAA began to soften . And finally , on March 11 , after a meeting in Washington between Pena and FAA administrator Donald Engen , the agency capitulated . <p> Barbo , the former Denver FAA chief , said his office was left out of the loop on airport decisions after that . <p> Indeed , the FAA seemed to go out of its way to help . Its projection that Denver would see 72 million passengers a year by the year 2000 made Stapleton look hopelessly obsolete . FAA officials in Washington now confess this forecast was based on faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Barbo told the Post . " A lot of people wanted this airport , including a lot of people in the FAA . " <p> Gordon Yale , a former Boettcher &; Co. analyst , said , " The business community got on the airport band wagon and roughed up anyone who got in its way . " <p> Meanwhile , those who promoted the airport achieved new status . Will Nicholson Jr. , then chairman of Colorado National Bankshares , " became a real hero in the business community " after his bank published a study of economic development around airports in Atlanta , Dallas and Kansas City , recalled former vice president Hull . <p> " If you read that report carefully , it did n't say we should build the airport . But if you read between the lines , it said we 'd be foolish not to . It was the only quality piece out there at the time , and the good old boys , the movers in the business community , were just crazy for it . Will was very much praised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad rap Denver felt it was getting around the country . Hull recalls a national advertising campaign by an airline that hubbed out of Salt Lake City . Capitalizing on Denver 's reputation for airline delays , the ad showed a disheveled business man arriving late to a meeting . Sheepishly , he explains : " Sorry . I flew through Denver . " <p> " That was seen as very embarrassing , " Hull said . " It was perceived as making the whole city look bad . " <p> The airport became a symbol : To build it meant Denver was rising from its ashes . Not to build it was a sign of defeat . After Denver residents approved the project by a margin of nearly 2-1 in 1988 , Romer exclaimed : " If we can do the airport , there is nothing we can not do . " <p> THE GOLD <p> Now that the airport is built and appears at last to be prepared to open , some expectations for the riches it will bring have been scaled back or at least postponed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of commercial and office space , more than twice the 23 million square feet in downtown Denver . And Adams County plotted a growth plan in 1988 that envisioned 9 million square feet of commercial space filling an area that could be twice the size of the city of Denver - a hope that one Adams county official now says " was maybe a little optimistic . " <p> Economic development officials say the growth will most certainly come , but it will be within decades rather than years . <p> And as for the promises that flew so easily during DIA 's inception ? Some of them perhaps were never meant to come through . John Frew , the mayoral candidate who managed the victorious pro-airport campaigns in Adams County and Denver , recalls those times and shrugs . " There was hyperbole in both sides , " he says , adding that he stands by everything he said then . " Someone had to have the vision to build it , " Frew said . " Just like somebody long ago had the vision to build Civic Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand of " vision " that built the airport was what built the West . At the turn of the century , railroad companies built lines from " nowhere to nowhere " then relied on outrageous promises to lure settlers , who drove up the price of land by farming it and incorporating towns . <p> One railroad company sent leaflets back to Midwestern farmers that exclaimed , " Rain Will Follow the Plow , " implying the arid Colorado climate would somehow change when they began tilling the soil . <p> Despite the outrageousness of such claims , it 's undeniable that railroads ultimately brought prosperity to cities such as Denver . DIA 's designers intended homage to that legacy when they modeled the terminal 's building 's proportions on Union Station downtown . <p> So , maybe in spite of the broken promises , Denver 's airport will ultimately fill its role . Or , perhaps the legacy of the railroads contains a warning . For every mile of track that was laid in the West , 16 miles were abandoned because they were never needed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
