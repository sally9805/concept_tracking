<p> DENVER  --  After losing two consecutive games to the Colorado Rockies , Astros manager Art Howe held a brief team meeting before the final game of the series Sunday . <p> Howe succinctly told his players he was not pleased with what he had seen in the last week , when the Astros lost two of three at Philadelphia and the first two games in Denver . <p> The Astros responded with some of the more ferocious swings you will see . Problem was , they were hitting nothing but air . <p> Rockies starter Bruce Ruffin struck out the first five batters he faced . <p> When the afternoon was over , the Astros had become the first team to be swept by the expansion Rockies . Ruffin and two relievers held the Astros to six hits in a 9-1 victory . The Astros ended their road trip having gone . <p> In the eighth inning , Howe was ejected by home-plate umpire Gary Darling . Howe had come to the mound to try to calm down relief pitcher Brian Williams , who was called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was kicked out as he left the field and did not have to watch an inning that was as dreadful as any the Astros will play this year . The Rockies scored six runs after two were out to put the game out of reach and lower the Astros to the depths of embarrasment . In the final two games of this series , the Astros allowed 23 runs and 34 hits to the Rockies , who had won just seven home games before Friday . <p> " " I 'm just not very happy right now , " Howe said . " " We did n't play all that well out there . That 's about all you can say . We 're going to be better . We 'll be all right . We 've got a day off ( today ) , and it 's coming at the right time . " <p> After Ruffin struck out the side in the first , Andres Galarraga hit a two-run homer off Astros starter Greg Swindell in the bottom of the inning . The Rockies got only one more run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who scored 11 runs and lost Saturday , scored one and lost Sunday . <p> " " They just flat kicked our butts for three games , " Swindell said . " " They were ready , and we were n't . " <p> If the past weekend is n't the low point of the season , general manager Bill Wood does n't want to be around when the nadir is reached . Before the game , Wood said he still was feeling the effects of Saturday 's 14-11 loss , in which the Astros led 7-0 after three innings . <p> " " If I 've ever been more down than last night , I ca n't remember the circumstances , " Wood said . " " From an overall standpoint , we performed terribly as a team in that game . If I was ever going to do anything rash or emotional , this is the environment in which I 'd do it . <p> " " I saw some pretty distressed individuals last night . By the same token , I saw some guys who were real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . We 're learning as we go about the players who want to make the commitment to be a winner . The guys who are not developing into winners , in our long-term plans , we do not want them to be a part of our team . " <p> Wood also was distressed that none of the veteran core of Astros players has stepped forward to say anything in an effort to lift the club out of the slump . He did not single out any players , but the only veteran every-day players the Astros have are third baseman Ken Caminiti , second baseman Craig Biggio and center fielder Steve Finley . <p> " " One of the things that concerns me is that none of our veteran players seems to be taking any type of leadership role at all , " Wood said . " " They want to win , and they all care about each other , but someone has to provide some leadership . <p> " " Art and the coaches can not provide 100 percent of the leadership . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've got to be the ones to help rally the club . You ca n't rely on the manager and the coaches to say the same things for 162 games to have any effect . <p> Another of Wood 's concerns about the Astros is the inconsistency of their pitchers . When the team left for this road trip , the staff ERA was a league-best 3.36 . Six games later , it is 3.79 . In the last week , opposing hitters have posted a .353 average against the Astros . <p> " " The main thing is the pitching has to be consistent all the way through , " Wood said . " " If you do n't have the consistent pitching all the way through , you will not win . These guys on this club have got to step forward and be more consistent . <p> " " We 've left the Astrodome twice now with the pitching at the top of the league in ERA . And where are we at the end of the road trip ? Buried about in the middle . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being stinko on the road . <p> " " Consistent pitching is being able to handle different ballparks , different weather conditions , the grass fields . How anybody could say that they 're satisfied with the pitching to this point , I do n't know . We 've got the potential to be much better than we are . Every individual on the pitching staff has to rise above the level where they 've been . Every single pitcher on the pitching staff is capable of giving us better than they have this year . <p> Individual games have been fine , but let 's be consistent . " Swindell gave the Astros a decent effort Sunday , allowing eight hits in six innings . However , he is 5-6 for the season and has a 5.00 ERA . Doug Drabek , the Astros ' other big-money free-agent acquisition , is 5-6 with a 3.35 ERA after allowing seven runs in five innings Saturday night . <p> Thanks to the Astros , the Rockies no longer have the worst record in baseball . That dubious distinction now belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below Colorado ( 20-41 ) . <p> Although Wood obviously is displeased with the Astros ' recent play , he said he is not considering doing anything to alter his roster . <p> " " I try not to react out of emotion , and I do n't want panic to be a part of my vocabulary , " Wood said . " " So as upset as we are with the way we 've played on this road trip and the other road trip ( 1-5 in San Francisco and San Diego ) , I try to broaden my viewpoint and look at the big scheme of things to see where we are , as opposed to focusing on an individual game or individual trend . <p> " " There 's great temptation to want to make changes . But the season is n't half over yet , so I basically feel that is not the kind of avenue we want to take . We 're in the third year out from starting all over again , and our expectations are very high for the club . We learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called veterans show us something under these circumstances . <p> You 've got to say to yourself , What if you did make a change ? What is the impact ? What is the bottom line , and at what cost ? " <p> The bottom line of this road trip was that the Astros fell 7 1/2 games behind San Francisco in the National League West . They are far from dead , but they will need to rebound in a hurry against San Diego before the first-place Giants come into the Astrodome next weekend . <p> " " It 's important that we put this behind us , " Swindell said . <p> " " We 've got two big series in the Dome coming up , and there 's no reason to remember anything about this series , that 's for sure .
