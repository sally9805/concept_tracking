<p> The early morning blackness almost erased the elephants from sight . It smoothed out their lumbering walk and turned them into graceful , gray ghosts . Their leg irons clanked out a slow , steady rhythm in the noisy symphony created as a circus shakes itself awake . <p> Diesel truck engines rumbled to life . Handlers shouted commands as they loaded elephants , horses , donkeys , llamas and camels into trailers . Metal fencing and tether chains clattered as workers tossed them on trucks . Dogs - both the performers and the pets - added to the din as they barked their displeasure at the pandemonium on a dry plateau about a mile east of Delta . <p> Daybreak was an hour and a half away and the only sounds to greet it here would be the crowing of roosters on nearby farms . <p> As quickly as it had come , the Carson &; Barnes Circus was gone . <p> All of it . The 400-by-150-foot vinyl big top ; seating for 3,000 spectators ; 100 animals ; 225 people ; and 35 private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small town , as the circus folks say . It has a power plant , water department , security force , short-order cafe ( called the pie car ) , a cook house and a gas station with mechanics and tow trucks always on duty . <p> But it 's a town that refuses to stay put . <p> Almost every day for nine months every year the Carson &; Barnes Five Ring Circus sweeps into a new town and puts on two shows " under the biggest big top on Earth . " <p> " That 's really part of the magic , " ringmaster John Moss III said . " There is this vacant lot that people are used to seeing . Then one morning all these trucks roll in and a circus appears . They come to see the animals and the performances . Then the next morning they drive by and it 's just a vacant lot again . And there are no signs that we were ever there . " <p> Two teenage girls stood in front of the largest concession trailer parked at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the red-and-white-striped big top . <p> Tuesday 's second show , which had begun at 8 p.m. , would n't end for another 20 minutes or so . But nothing in any of the five performing rings interested the two teenagers . <p> " There he is , " one giggled . <p> " Oh , yes . That 's him , " her friend replied . <p> " Hi , " they cooed together . <p> Jason Walker either ignored his admirers or did n't hear them . He silently continued to tear down and load up part of the animal compound that holds the horses , dogs and camels his mother , Laura Herriott , trains . She also performs in the show . <p> The girls probably first spotted Walker in Ring One , where he runs a horse and dog act , or in Ring Five during his juggling act . <p> Walker is a handsome , poised 15-year-old . <p> It 's not easy , he said , to date while on the road . And his three-month winter hiatus in Florida does n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends in Sarasota , Fla. , where he attends school those three months . <p> " I go to school but I 'm always thinking about the circus . The circus is all I think about . I would much rather be working in the circus than playing football or basketball , " Walker said . <p> Some circus children leave the road during the school year . Many of them attend school in Hugo , Okla. , Carson &; Barnes ' home base . <p> Those who travel the entire season , March to November , take correspondence courses . <p> Walker 's life on the road is healthier than that lived by the kids back in Florida , he said . <p> " None of the kids in the circus do drugs . Our bodies are too important to us , " he said . <p> Walker wants to become the greatest juggler in the world and use his talent to play the lavish shows in Las Vegas . <p> He is not a typical teenager , but he is an archetypical Carson &; Barnes employee . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on both sides of his family . His maternal roots include a performer in Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show . <p> His father , John Walker Jr. , owns Walker Brothers Circus , a one-ring big top show that tours the East Coast . Walker 's 19-year-old brother , John III , followed in his father 's footsteps to become an elephant trainer . He works for his father . <p> His mother travels with Carson &; Barnes . She also trains the three camels that perform in the show , an act Jason dismisses with a grunt . " They just kind of turn around in circles , " he said . " They 're too dumb to learn much more than that . " <p> Thirteen-year-old Jennifer Walker joins Jason in the family horse and dog act . And both march in the theme parade during the shows . <p> Of the 225 people who travel with the circus , only 80 perform . They are from Peru , China , Mexico , Colombia , Argentina and the United States , which gives the ritual midmorning soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify to the melting pot of circus life . <p> " I 'm from Argentina , " said Liliana Ramirez . " My husband , Julio , is Peruvian . My daughter is Mexican . She was born when we were working a circus there . And my son , who is 4 months old , is an American . He was born in the U.S. , in Texas . " <p> Julio Ramirez leads a flying act , which is circus slang for trapeze artists . Flying acts are the home run hitters of the circus . Most circuses have them open the show or appear right after intermission . <p> But it is a Carson &; Barnes tradition that they close the show by soaring from their perches and plunging down onto a rope safety net . They flip from the nets and raise their arms to acknowledge the cheers . <p> That scene was repeated on a recent afternoon . <p> And the crowd quickly filed out , hoping to find a breeze challenging the 100-degree temperature . <p> But the cheers and applause had barely died when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big top . <p> Ramirez had changed from his sequined costume into black tights . He stretched out a rubber mat near Ring Five and lay down on his back . He pulled his knees toward his chest and cocked his ankles to make a small seat out of his feet . <p> Karina climbed on it . Her hands cupped his heels . <p> Suddenly , she was supine and his feet had shifted to the middle of her back and thighs . A U formed between her thighs and waist . It caused her bottom to hang down between his feet . <p> Liliana walked over , patted Karina 's behind and spoke to her in Spanish . The girl stiffened . That correction meant her father could spin her into a blur . <p> But he did n't . Instead they shifted back to the sitting position . And for about 20 minutes they practiced the one move . The mother served as a human safety net , catching her daughter when errors sent her flying . <p> Then for several minutes the girl practiced dismounting via backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her how to keep her legs together for smooth , high landings . <p> " We started working with her a year , a year and a half ago , " Liliana said . " We try to do two hours every day . ... We teach her this , a little act for her and her father . " <p> After each landing , Karina threw her arms out and slightly up to acknowledge the cheers that she will hear when her parents think she 's ready . <p> " It is hard to say when , " Liliana said . " Maybe next year . Yes , probably next year . " <p> Tuesday night 's show in Rifle drew a capacity crowd . It was a good one that ended too quickly . The spectators lingered , unwilling to let the magic go . <p> What they did n't know was that the real excitement was about to begin . <p> People , animals and machines would work as a team to have the circus packed and ready for the road by 11:30 p.m. - about 90 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jim Judkins , the general manager , tells a story about a retired Carson &; Barnes employee visiting the circus one day . <p> " She was in the pie car talking with some of the people and she said , ' You know why you all are able to do what everybody says ca n't be done and move this size of circus every day ? It 's because you 're all too stupid to know it ca n't be done . " ' <p> It seems impossible until one watches it being done . And to really appreciate it , one must return to the plateau outside Delta where Carson &; Barnes ' Tuesday began . <p> A tick or two before 5 a.m. , Judkins drove the first semi-trailer truck down from the plateau . An advance man had mapped the route to Rifle by taping small black and white arrows on sign posts . <p> " You get to see a lot of the country this way - before 7 o'clock in the morning , " he said , pleased with how the obviously well-worn line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contented man at home as he drove eastbound on Interstate 70 . A large cup of coffee sat on the console and his pet Yorkie , Dandy-lion , stood on his lap . <p> At 6:59 , Judkins pulled up to a freshly mowed hay field just north of an elementary school . <p> The advance man had laid out the circus by planting scores of red and yellow plastic flags like those used by surveyors . <p> " Problems . I got problems . I can already tell it . I do n't have enough room , " Judkins said , as he shut down his tractor . <p> He conferred with the advance man , walked off several distances and decided the circus would fit if he reversed the layout . <p> Judkins started directing traffic to make sure each vehicle ended up in its assigned spot . <p> At 7:25 men began to lay perimeter poles and stakes around the flags that marked the tent location . <p> By 7:38 , the big top was rolled off its two spools and laid in two sections 200 feet long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile drivers slammed four-foot wooden and metal stakes into the ground , while big top boss Jaime Garcia and his crew of some 30 men unfolded the tent . Using rope , they stitched the tent together and attached the sidewalls . <p> At 8:58 the elephants arrived to help raise the tent by muscling up the 100 or so 25- to 32-foot aluminum poles that support it . <p> Twenty-nine minutes later the big top was up , and the trucks that carry the seating drove under it . <p> It was show-ready at 10:25 . <p> Meanwhile , other crews had set up the various animal compounds , which include tarp-shaded pens . The pie car , cook house and the midway also had been completed . <p> By 11 a.m. crew members and performers were playing on a nearby soccer field . <p> Two shows and 11 hours later , Garcia whistled his crew to action in the empty big top . <p> The men responded as if he had started a race . They ran everywhere , even when carrying props , poles and equipment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed everything but the grandstands . That cleared the way for the elephants to help take down the poles . <p> Outside , the guy ropes and cables had been removed , as had the sidewalls . <p> At 10:37 , the east end of the big top hit the ground . Six minutes later the last seating truck drove out of the tent . <p> Three minutes later the 40,000-pound big top lay flat on the ground . The crew tossed the guy ropes and cables onto the tent . Then they folded it . <p> That ended the day for all but a couple of crew members who helped Garcia wind the tent back on the spools . <p> At 11:11 , the small town of Carson &; Barnes was ready for the road .
