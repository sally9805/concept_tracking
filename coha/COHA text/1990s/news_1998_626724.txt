<p> Dora Cisneros was found guilty Tuesday of arranging for the 1993 murder of her daughter 's ex-boyfriend , a killing that drew national attention because of the bizarre circumstances of the crime . <p> Cisneros , 60 , the wife of a prominent Brownsville surgeon , was escorted out of the federal courtroom in handcuffs . Jurors had taken 2 1/2 hours to decide she , with the help of an aging folk healer and a lovelorn house painter , hired a team of Dallas-based hit men to gun down Joey Fischer outside his home in the Rancho Viejo resort . The slaying came 10 months after Fischer , 18 , broke up with Cristina Cisneros , the defendant 's youngest daughter . <p> " We 're relieved . This woman is a murderer of children - she killed our Joey and should be put away , " said Vernon " Beau " Nelson , who is married to the victim 's mother , Corinne Nelson . " Joey finally got justice today . " <p> " Maybe this is the end of all this hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . <p> Fischer 's parents had divorced and each remarried prior to the crime , but during the six-day trial they sat together . After the verdict was announced , the two couples embraced and wept . <p> " We 've been here once before , and hopefully what was done today will hold up under further scrutiny , " said A.J. " Buddy " Fischer Sr. , the victim 's father . <p> He was referring to Cisneros ' 1994 capital murder conviction in state court and life sentence , which were overturned two years later by a Corpus Christi appeals court because of a faulty jury instruction . Cisneros ' well-heeled legal team , which includes appellate specialist David Botsford , is expected to appeal her federal conviction . <p> She was found guilty of using an interstate communication device , a telephone , in the murder-for-hire scheme . She faces up to life in prison without parole . <p> Cisneros had no visible reaction to Tuesday 's verdict , and her husband and two daughters declined comment as they left the courtroom . <p> During 5 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 40 witnesses to prove Cisneros had asked Maria Mercedes Martinez - a Brownsville folk healer who had been telling Cisneros ' fortune for years - to find professional killers to murder Fischer . <p> Martinez , now 77 and serving a 20-year sentence in state prison , testified she told Cisneros the cards showed there was no hope Cristina would get back with Fischer . Cisneros returned and asked the curandera to cast a spell - using a doll to represent Fischer - to kill the boy . <p> Martinez refused , but Cisneros later asked her to find someone to do the killing for $ 3,000 . The folk healer turned to San Antonio house painter Daniel Garza , who had sought her advice when his wife left him in 1992 . Garza also knew members of a Dallas-based drug trafficking and car theft ring that occasionally did contract killing . <p> Cisneros was arrested a month later , on April 6 , 1993 , after she handed over $ 500 to her folk healer , supposedly hush money for the hit men . But Cisneros did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with authorities by wearing a concealed microphone . <p> During the conversation , Cisneros could be heard asking the curandera , " And , and , There is n't any evidence that I did anything ? " Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker told the jury Cisneros ' own words proved her guilt . <p> " That 's her statement , " he said , " and it makes absolutely no sense unless she is the author of this scheme . " <p> But lead defense attorney Tony Canales assailed the credibility of both the folk healer and Garza , noting they had contradicted themselves repeatedly . Garza and another government witness both acknowledged they were testifying in hopes of receiving significant reductions in their own prison terms . <p> Jurors heard the sad details of a crime that had its origins in the happy and carefree days at a private , exclusive Catholic coed high school in Brownsville . <p> Prosecutors called witnesses to show how Joey Fischer , a graduating senior headed for engineering school , was a late bloomer who had only recently begun noticing girls and never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmate Cristina Cisneros to the senior prom and gave her his senior ring . <p> Cristina was the youngest child of Dora and Dr. David Cisneros . Joey 's father was a former banker who had started a new career with northeastern manufacturing companies that had relocated to the border . <p> But the relationship lasted only from the spring of 1992 to the beginning of summer , apparently cut short by Joey 's new interest in a girl from San Antonio he had met at a relative 's wedding . <p> Whether the relationship between Joey and Cristina had become intimate was not made clear during the trial . <p> Called by the government as an adverse witness , Cristina denied she and Joey had sex . But Garza , the house painter who served as the go-between with the killers , testified Martinez told him the young couple had sexual relations at the Cisneros ' condominium on South Padre Island . <p> Regardless , Cristina would n't give Joey his ring back despite repeated requests and threats of legal action , the boy 's family testified . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop between Joey 's father and her mother . <p> " She ( Dora Cisneros ) asked me if there was anything I could do to get Joey to keep seeing Cristina , " Buddy Fischer testified during the trial . Cisneros said Joey would get his ring back , but she wanted to " make him sweat " before returning it , Fischer recalled . <p> There were threatening phone calls from Cisneros to the boy , his friends testified , and Joey 's mother came home one day and found a chilling surprise in the mailbox . Someone had left a tarot card , the card with a skull and crossbones signifying death , in an envelope with her name on it . <p> And the morning Fischer was shot twice as he washed off the car windshield in his driveway - within earshot of his mother , brother , sister and stepfather - authorities had little evidence to act on . A white , four-door Ford or Lincoln with Mexican license plates had been seen leaving the area , but no one witnessed the shooting . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying next to Fischer 's body . They quickly traced the card to the Dallas drug-trafficking gang , and that led to Garza in San Antonio and eventually back to Brownsville and the folk healer . <p> " For some reason , who knows , by the grace of God , there was a card on the driveway , " government prosecutor Oscar Ponce told the jury . <p> As bad as the crime was , prosecutor Mosbacker told jurors in closing arguments , it was even worse that she involved her daughter . He accused Cristina , who testified last week as an adverse witness , of trying to provide an alibi for her mother the morning Fischer was killed . <p> He said Cristina was present when her mother went to a Brownsville bank to retrieve cash from a safety deposit box , she knew the killing had occurred , and she was present when her mother dropped off the initial $ 3,000 payment at the folk healer 's shop hours after the murder . <p> Cristina Cisneros has never been charged with any crime . <p> U.S. District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Houston on July 27 .
