I was standing on the slick concrete floor of the barn hall , smoking a cigarette , waiting for Clement . It was four-thirty in the morning , and the dew on the roadside grass leading to the barn sparkled in the moonlight . Clement said he 'd be here at five , but I hoped he would be here sooner and we could get this thing done . It was cool outside , and when the wind eased through the barn , it hardly felt like May . <p> The Queen of England was coming next week , and I was sorry it was n't going to mean much . She was going to visit some of the horses she 'd been boarding at Indigo Farm five miles from here . Then she was supposed to go to the races at Lexington Fields the following afternoon . Her itinerary had been listed in the newspaper . Horse farms failing all over Kentucky , and the Queen was coming . I 'd lost mine and was about to move to Miami where I had a job selling speedboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the coal out with the toe of my boot . I walked down the brightly lit hall past a series of stalls on either side and opened the door to the tackroom . I turned on the light and just stood there for a minute trying to warm up . Back at the house this morning I was going to make coffee , had gotten out the tin of grounds , but then stood at the sink and cried . <p> In the tackroom now , I regretted that scene at the sink even more . It had simply come out of nowhere , and afterward I wiped my face with a tea towel and felt like a fool . And I had n't made any coffee , either . <p> There was a small chocolate-colored refrigerator in the corner of the tackroom where Otis , my former stallion manager , used to keep candy bars and beer . The top of the refrigerator and the floor around it were cloaked in dust , the plug lying next to the outlet , its prongs bent . I went over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cans of Coors on the top shelf . I took one , dry and warm , clicked open the top and took a drink . I set about getting a bucket of soapy water ready , finishing the beer as I found the things I needed on the shelf . <p> In the stall next to the tack room , Silver Patriot rustled his straw , sniffing the floor for stray oats . This was the first time I 'd had the horse in the barn since I sold him , and he seemed tense . I 'd bed Silver Patriot to seventy-nine mares that spring , about twice the normal amount . Five years ago , if a man had a decent stallion he could screen the mares , only selecting the top ones for mating . But this was when the yearling market was ablaze with foreign money and horses were more valuable than the land they grazed on . Then the yearling market collapsed , and the money all dried up . If a man owned a stallion , he compensated for the tough times by breeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Silver Patriot now belonged to a man named Francis Skiles , an Oklahoman who 'd escaped the oil bust . Skiles bought Silver Patriot and the rest of my farm . He was moving in tomorrow , and I was leaving for Miami tonight . Skiles had been all right about giving me time to pack , sell off the furniture and all that . What I had left was a sand-colored Mercedes owned by a dummy corporation I 'd set up when I 'd seen trouble coming ; my clothes , except for the serious winter stuff I 'd dropped off to the Salvation Army ; some trophies my horses had won . A few of the nicer pieces anyway . I had some money in a bank in Atlanta . <p> I had this job waiting for me in Miami . A friend of mine , Tim Willis , who used to have Havrewood Place over on Ferrick Pike , had moved to Florida last yea and started a speedboat dealership with what he had left over . He said I could start anytime , that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell anything . <p> Before Francis Skiles bought my place , he had me agree to stop breeding Silver Patriot for that season . He was indignant about it , actually . I said , fine , fine , he 's your horse now , do what you think is best . Skiles liked to look me in the eye all the time , a cowboy thing I guessed , and I smiled at him and thought , wait till it gets tight for you , Oklahoma . You 'll have the lights burning in the breeding shed twenty-four hours a day . <p> I 'd used the Queen 's visit as a selling tool . hen Skiles first came to inspect my place , he 'd looked over the high grass and falling fences disapprovingly . His eyes grew wide though , when I started telling him about the Queen . She 'll be right over there , I said . And you 'll be right here . You 'll be able to tell your friends what the top of the world feels like . <p> The week before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure Silver Patriot was in good condition . It turned out to be Doc Kirkland , who 'd been out to my place a couple times before . He was young , mid-twenties , a big broad kid from Auburn , bald as an onion from a chemical he 'd made himself and had tried out on a mangy parakeet . The first time I met Kirkland was on Christmas day a year and a half ago . I usually used Doc Gillen , but he was vacationing in the Bahamas , so the vet clinic sent this kid over . Kirkland stitched up a yearling of mine that 'd torn his legs all to hell while running through a fence . The kid talked the whole time he worked the stitching needle , telling me about his education , how he was the youngest vet ever to graduate Auburn . After he 'd tied off the last stitch , he stood up straight , stretched his arms and smiled . " Man , the famous Kentucky horse business , " he said . " I 've always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tired in the cold and doing all that stitching had muddled his mind , so I took him up to the house , and we sat in the kitchen and drank some whiskey , while my second wife , Donna , leaned against the stove and watched . Kirkland was all splattered with blood , and Donna seemed a little horried , probably imagining him to be a time-warped member of the Gestapo . Donna was like that anyway , halfway disgusted with anything that had to do with the horse business . At one time , she 'd been a Miss Harrisburg or Hand Creme Queen or something , and I 'd sat next to her at the Derby a few years ago . We started there . When the banks starred getting edgy about me , so did she . Donna was living in Ohio now and had remarried : a relief to my alimony . <p> The second time Doc Kirkland came to my farm was last summer . I was getting some two-year-olds cleaned up for a couple of retired surgeons from New Hampshire who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three colts off , considered the asking price for each as I shined the name plates on their halters . When I checked over their papers , I discovered all three needed vaccinations . Doc Gillen was away on another call and since it was a routine deal , I just told the woman at the switchboard to send over anyone available . <p> It was Doc Kirkland . He pulled up in his new Blazer . He shook my hand . " Glad you asked for me , " he said . " Glad my name 's getting around . " <p> We walked to the first stall . The colt in there began tensing up as soon as he saw us . Once we were in the stall with him , I took the chain end of my leather shank , ran it though one ring of the halter , under his upper lip and hooked the clip to the ring on the other side of the halter . I tightened down on the shank so the horse could feel the chain across its gums and the animal stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse struck at him . Kirkland reached for the shank , yanked it out of my hands and pulled down on it hard . " Son of a bitch ! " he said , " How 's that now ! " The sound of the chain against the horse 's teeth made me wince , though it was something I 'd heard before . <p> Kirkland released the shank and the two-year-old stood there , its whole body trembling . The animal tried chewing the chain , blood dripping from its lips . I took a step towards the horse , holding my hands in front of me . I eased my grip around the shank and with my other hand , reached up and lifted its upper lip . Three big front teeth were missing , the sockets bloody and deep . I took the chain out of its mouth . " Get some peroxide , " I said without looking at Kirkland . " And a tranquilizer . " <p> After we 'd cleaned the horse up reasonably well and Kirkland had put a few stitches in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kirkland kept shaking his head . " Man , I 'm sorry , " he said . He kicked at the floor . " What am I gon na have to do to make this up ? " <p> " I have buyers coming here today , " I said . " What can you do ? " <p> " I 'll stay here and tell them what happened , " he said . " I 'll tell them you had a vet here with a bad temper . " He blinked and spit on the floor . " Maybe we could make fake teeth out of plaster , , " he said . " You can tell your buyers to come back next week . " <p> " Forget it , " I said . I thought I might be able to sell the horse anyway and was already running through my sales lines to see if any covered a horse missing its front teeth . <p> " Well , I know I owe you , " he said , not looking up . " I mean I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things for one another . I want to be part of that anyway . " <p> " Never mind , " I said . " Just get out of here . Sign the papers and leave me the shots . I 'll take care of it . " <p> When it was time for Francis Skiles to send over a vet , I waited down by the barn and up pulled Kirkland in his Blazer . He stepped out of it and smiled broadly . He was wearing a tan jumpsuit and his head shone in the afternoon sunlight . He walked over and clasped my hand . " They got a call from a guy this morning about a health check and when I heard it was your place , man , I volunteered right away . " <p> " It 's just a health check , " I said . I headed for Silver Patriot 's stall . <p> Kirkland followed . " I kept asking the office if you called in anymore , " he said . <p> " I do n't have any horses left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall . <p> " Look , " Kirkland said , " This horse looks good to me , right ! I mean if you do n't want me looking him over too close , I wo n't . " <p> " There 's nothing wrong with this hose , " I said . <p> Kirkland shook his head and glanced at the opening of the barn entrance . " I 'll just wave my hand here , and you have your health certificate . Your horse will get sold , and I 've done something for you . " <p> " Look , " I said . <p> Kirkland held his hand up . " You think I do n't know how things work ? Come on . " <p> I pulled the stall door open too quickly , and it spooked Silver Patriot . He propped and went to the back of the stall . " You go in there and check every hair on this bastard , " I said . " There 's nothing wrong here . I do n't want anything from you . " <p> Kirkland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swing . But what would he think he owed me then ? This was the kind of man who made the business bad anyway . You do what you have to do and say what you have to say and all of it evens out when we 're six feet under . Damn fool kid . <p> Kirkland shrugged after a moment and stepped into the stall . He checked out the horse . Everything was fine . The next day I sold Silver Patriot to Skiles . <p> I had a friend , though . Clement Parks was his name , and his farm was in trouble , too . He and I had been sitting in a dinky bar in Midway two weeks ago , and he was in a dismal mood . He groaned when I told him about selling Silver Patriot . <p> He said that was too bad ; he wanted to breed a mare to him . Clement had high times when the market was good . We agreed it was a shame everyone was going out of business . Clement said his mare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him keep his place going another year . " You know , " he said , " if my place keeps going , in a way yours does , too . " There was a pause , and then he and I laughed together . A good horseman , above all else , did n't get conned . That 's what Clement was trying to do there . I knew selling speedboats would n't be the same , and I wanted someone to survive , even if it was n't going to be me . <p> At one time , Clement 's operation had been impressive . He owned three dozen mares , a couple stallions , and when things were going just right , he 'd bought a French racehorse named Eclair and brought it to Kentucky . He sold shares , even ran an advertisement offering Eclair 's breeding services in The Wall Street Journal . Clement got so carried away he had a chandelier installed at the center of the ceiling in his breeding barn . <p> It was a huge thing , that chandelier . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight underneath as Clement switched the lights on and off . <p> " It looks like a spaceship , " I said . <p> " Class , " he said . <p> As Clement 's farm vet put it , Eclair proved to be sans desire , or as he told Clement who did n't understand at first , unable . Clement tried giving the horse special vitamins and feed supplements , brought in fertility doctors from Humana in Louisville , and even called in an animal psychologist . The psychologist went in the stall with Eclair , put a hand on the horse 's forehead , Eclair reared , struck at the psychologist and broke the man 's arm at the elbow . <p> When Clement 's farm started to go , it was like mine and went fast . The yearling market had gone sour , and he borrowed against his land to pay the bills , and then the value of land collapsed because somebody finally figured out raising thoroughbreds was a fairly risky enterprise . A few of the lucky ones had seen it coming and bailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holding on by our wits alone . <p> Around five A.M. , the whining suspension of a horse trailer in the distance made Silver Patriot jog to the door of his stall . I 'd finished preparing the bucket of soapy water and stepped out into the hall . I walked over to his stall door . The horse had its muzzle pressed against the screen on the top part of the door . I looked under him . His speckled penis came rolling out of the sheath . Clockwork , I thought . He snorted , the gray coat covering his spine dull in the shadowy light of the stall . <p> I walked outside . There was another barn I used for breeding , the floor there covered with soft wood shavings , the walls padded . This morning we were going to have to do it down here , out of the way . Park a trailer in font of the breeding barn , turn the lights on , hell , I might as well take an ad out in the paper . <p> If Skiles found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might happen . He could sue me for breach of contract or try to have me put in jail . One thing for sure is that our deal would be off . The Queen would 've come and gone , and I 'd still be stuck with this farm . <p> These were anxious times . A man I knew at Readacres in Tompkinsville was in lock-up for three months after he 'd stolen a lawn jockey from the front entrance of his farm after he 'd sold the place to land developers . There were a million worse things I could be doing other than letting Clement breed his mare to Silver Patriot , but if we got caught somehow it would 've been the worst thing that could happen for me . I did n't want to be the last horseman left in Kentucky . What do you think that poor son of a bitch would be resorting to ? <p> I stood in front of the barn as the truck 's headlights glanced down the road towards me . It was still dark outside , the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fifty yards away , I waved for it to pull around the back of the barn . The truck turned off the road , angled for the side of the barn , the trailer dipping as it went over low spots in the grass . The truck drove alongside the barn , and I walked after it . <p> When Clement had the truck and trailer behind the barn entirely , he switched off the engine . Silently , he stepped out of the truck and , like a shadow  --  it was that dark  --  jogged to the rear of the trailer and threw open the iron arm which helped hold the back ramp in place . He jumped on the wheel cover on the side of the trailer . He was a short man , late thirties , and was wearing jeans , a light-colored T-shin and a ball cap . He reached up and tried unhooking the top latch , now the only thing holding the ramp up . When Clement had bought this trailer a few years ago it had the newest , greatest thing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered and raised quietly and carefully without startling the horses inside . But something had gone wrong a few months after he bought it , and when Clement called the company to complain , he discovered they were out of business . <p> Now , he gave the ramp a push , and it swooped to the ground and landed with a muffled thud in the soft grass . Clement jumped down from the wheel cover . He walked over to me , shook my hand , " Do you miss it yet ? " he said . <p> " I 'll be in sunny Florida while you 're standing here in a goddamn food line , " I said , laughing . <p> " Right , " he smiled . <p> We unloaded Clement 's mare , and he clipped the end of a rope shank to her halter and led her around to the front of the barn . Once we stepped into the barn hall , the mare 's hooves clattered on the concrete and Silver Patriot grunted from his stall . The mate swatted her head from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was a small bay , kind of dumpy looking really , and once , a foal of hers had sold for $300,000 . I guessed Clement had n't time to clean her up because her mane was dunked by dried dirt , her back dusty . <p> I could see Clement more clearly in the barn hall light . His eyes seemed energized , his face deeply lined and listless . I reached in my pocket , took out the breeding certificate and held it to him . " Before I forget , " I said . <p> Clement took the paper , stuffed it in his pocket . " When I get my things in order , " he said , " I 'll send you payment of the stud fee . " <p> " Right , okay , " I said . I walked to a stall across the hall from Silver Patriot 's . " Let 's put her in there , " I said , pushing the door open . Clement led his mare in there , and I went across the hall to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating on top and picked a roll of Vetrap off the shelf . <p> Clement held the mare while I tied her tail from the top halfway down with Vetrap . Then I washed her out . " So if I need to make my getaway by sea , you 're the man to call " Clement said . <p> " Speedboats , " I said , " Now there 's something a man can look forward to selling . " I smiled at him . " ' Yes sir , this model does come in yellow . ' " <p> After we finished with the mare , Clement and I left her in the stall , and we walked across the hall to Silver Patriot 's stall . I went to the tack room to get a leather shank and a twitch , a long wooden cane with a rope loop at one end , something I always had to use on Silver Patriot because around breeding time he 'd about lose his mind and would rear and strike at anything . <p> Clement had Silver Patriot 's stall door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The animal 's eyes were burning brilliantly . I handed Clement the shank , and he hooked the clip at the end of it to the horse 's halter . I put my hand through the loop at the head of the twitch and reached for Silver Patriot 's muzzle . I pulled the heavy skin towards me , tilted my wrist up and let the rope fall across the tips of my fingers . I nodded to Clement , and he took the twitch near the bottom and began turning it . The rope tightened around the horse 's muzzle , and that sensation froze him . I 'd seen horses try getting out of a switch but Silver Patriot always stood like a soldier when I had it on him . <p> " We going to do this down here ? " Clement said , quietly , as I was washing the horse off . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " It 'll be fine . " I stood up and Clement looked concerned . " Our luck ca n't be that bad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untwisted the twitch , removed the shank-clip from the horse 's halter . Silver Patriot went to the back of the stall , then came forward snorting after we stepped out . <p> " We 'll just do it in the hall , " I said , " Right here in the hall . If my stud has trouble finding the mare , I 'll drop the shank and help him . " <p> " It 's not like he 's going to fun away from it , huh ? " Clement said . He went to get his mare . He led her out with the rope shank he 'd brought , and they waited for me in the middle of the hall . I stepped next to Clement and put the twitch on the mare . I went back over to Silver Patriot 's stall and hooked the leather shank back on him . I could n't use any twitch on him then ; he was the one who needed to do the moving . <p> I brought Silver Patriot out of the stall , and he went straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffed at her , his sides pulsing with swift breath , hooves splattering nervously on the floor . I stood at the end of the shank , letting him do what he wanted . The mare raised a back hoof , and Clement tightened the twitch down , and she lowered it again . <p> Silver Patriot heaved himself on her . His penis was firm and erect and entered her easily . I was relieved there . Sometimes a stallion could get crazy if he could n't find his mare . Normally you had a man there for just that reason , to take hold of the stallion 's penis and help it with entry . <p> Silver Patriot thrust at the mare several times , and I wondered what would happen if somebody drove onto my farm , lost or needing to use the phone and saw this light in this barn and found Clement and I here doing what we were doing . What would they think ? Two bankrupt horsemen breeding a mare and stallion in the dead of night . We 'd tell the stranger a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And I thought about Francis Skiles finding out and the color of this face and him threatening to do everything about it I could imagine . The kind of man who 'd make nothing but trouble for me . <p> Clement was watching the mating intently , and I thought of that damn chandelier in his breeding shed . It was gone now , the bank had seen to that . But it had been a fabulous thing , something you 'd be unlikely to forget . How could you not want to help a man who 'd done something like that ? <p> Silver Patriot rested now atop Clement 's mare . He gnawed at her mane , his weight seemingly heavy on her back . Clement nodded to me , and I pulled the shank to get the stud 's attention . Silver Patriot did n't respond , and I yanked on the shank again . The horse tried half-heartedly to dismount . " Come on , now , " I said , yanking at him again . His hooves had slid forward during the mating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare . <p> I was ready to tell Clement to move the mare up a step when Silver Patriot tried dismounting again . His hooves slipped . The horse landed on his rump right at the mare 's back feet , and there was a moment when the animal was sitting up like a dog . He fell straight backward then , the tops of his shoulders and the back of his head hitting the floor . There was a quick cracking noise , something in the bones giving way . The mare kicked at the commotion , and Clement swiftly pulled her away . <p> Silver Patriot rolled to his side and was motionless . He breathed fiercely , his eyes blaring , wide open . The barn hall was very quiet then . Clement stuck the mare in one of the stalls and came over to where the horse was lying . " Something snapped , " he said . Clement took off his hat and ran a hand over his thin hair . <p> " His back , I think , " I said . <p> " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow light . Thirty minutes and it would be daybreak . The horse 's rib cage rose and dropped . One of his eyes seemed to be staring up at the ceiling , an eye bright and shining like a huge , wonderful marble . I hoped the stud would n't get phobic and start struggling against what was wrong . That would be horrible because Clement and I would n't be able to do anything but watch . <p> Silver Patriot could n't move . Clement grabbed me by the wrist . " What are you going to say ? " he said . " What are you going to tell everyone ? " <p> I shook my head and felt my lips tighten . <p> " He 's insured right ? " Clement said . " You said that skinhead vet had been here . " <p> " Yep , " I said . I turned and walked a short way down the hall . I wanted to get in my ca and drive to Florida and sit in a lounge chair for a month dreaming up alibis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I nodded without turning to look at him . " You know how that old bastard is . He 'll ask questions . " <p> I did n't know about that . Maybe if Doc Gillen got here , he could work with us a little . I turned and started back for the horse . Its penis was still erect , the tip touching the bottom of its stomach . I 'd heard of something like that , men who were paralyzed in wars still getting hard-ons , but this signaled something worse to me now : loss of control . <p> Clement was gone . I heard something from the tackroom , and I could n't think of what he might be doing . Something fell to the floor , and Clement swore . I hoped his mind was working all right . At some point he 'd have to get his mare and trailer out of here . <p> He appeared from the tackroom carrying a bright orange safety extension cord . It was a long , thick cord we used for X-raying horses in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was in the tackroom . The cord 's insulation and thick rubber exterior protected open wires and sparks from touching the straw on the stall floors . <p> He walked over to me , trying to sort tangles . " I have a plan , " he said , without looking up . " I 'm gon na pull my truck around and we 're going to drag this horse out to his paddock . " <p> " With this cord , " I said , taking a bit of it in my hand . " It 'll snap like a goddamn rubber band . " <p> " We 'll double it up and double that up if we have to , " he said . " It 'll hold . " He handed the cord to me . " I got a chain in the truck , " he said . " We 'll get this done . " I paused a second , then took the cord . " I thought about tying some of your shanks together , " he said , " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Damn , Clement , " I said . <p> He kicked the cord away from his feet . " You take care of this , " he said . " I 'll bring the truck around . " He turned and suddenly ran past Silver Patriot , threw open the hall door and disappeared . <p> I worked on untangling the cold . When Clement 's engine started up , I pictured him just driving off and leaving me to do all the explaining . Then I heard his truck stop along the side of the barn . He was unhitching his trailer , was going to do what he said . He 'd never just leave his mare , of course , I knew that . He needed this stud to be out of the barn , his mare out of here , so he could get back to trying to save his farm . He 'd back up my story , and I 'd back up his , whatever it turned out to be . <p> We did what Clement suggested . The horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clement reversed his truck in and brought out a chain as thick as a man 's wrist with big hooks at either end . Clement pushed one hook under the horse 's foreleg , then stepped over , reached under the animal and pulled the hook through , the chain following it . I did the same with the cord , having doubled it twice and shoved the two loop ends under the animal 's lowest rib cage bone . I stepped over the horse and pulled the loops through . I hooked the loops to the bumper of Clement 's truck , then went to get the other ends to tie them off . Clement did the same with the chain . <p> After we finished getting the horse tied behind the bumper , Clement went to get in his truck . Silver Patriot had attempted raising his head twice to see what was going on , but could only get it a few inches off the floor before the strain got to him . <p> Before Clement pulled the driver 's door shut , he yelled , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door and started the engine . I stepped to a spot a yard from my horse 's belly . <p> Clement eased the truck forward . The chain and cord tightened , and the horse was pulled forward a few inches . The animal 's hooves raised from the floor , and I thought it was going to roll over . " Keep going ! " I said . He gave the truck more gas and headed for the hall entrance . The cord and chain held , and the horse did n't roll over , though its feet were angled upward crazily like an animal still falling . <p> Once Clement was on the hard dirt road in front of the barn , he aimed for the closest paddock , about forty yards away . He was going steady now , ten miles an hour , a good clip if you 're pulling a thousand-pound animal behind you . Clement got off the dirt road and drove over the high , wet grass of the field . Silver Patriot 's head remained lazily to one side and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't alive anymore . <p> The gate to the field was open , and Clement drove through and out about sixty yards , the tips of the grass touching the underside of his truck . Clement stopped the truck and left the engine running . He jumped out , and he and I unhooked the horse . After Clement had thrown the chain and cord in the bed of the truck , he nodded to the path he 'd made , the grass bent to the ground by the weight of the horse being pulled across it . The worst things though were those tire tracks . It looked exactly like what it was : a paralyzed animal had been drug to the center of a field . <p> Clement put his hands on his hips , surveying the path . " What are you going to tell them ? " he said . <p> " I 'll think of something , " I said . <p> " I do n't know about this , " he said . " Maybe I 've had better ideas . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You better go now . Make sure you back out over the tracks . " The horizon had broken by this time and nightfall had almost disappeared . <p> Clement shook my hand . I thought he wanted to say something to me , good luck probably , but I guess he did n't want to sound scared . " I already forgot your name , " I said , and he nodded . He walked over and got back in his truck , carefully backed around the horse , then straight out over the tracks . He pulled around the side of the barn , hooked up his trailer , went in the barn to get his mare , and then he was gone . <p> I looked at the path and thought , this is only one set of tracks , it should n't be that hard to cover it up . I stood there for a minute thinking about my options . After a minute , I headed up for the house to call the vet clinic . Then I 'd have to call Skiles , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would n't take long for that : insurance men were already jumpy and suspicious about every horse claim anyway . They 'd want to get here quickly , judge for themselves if an animal could be saved . <p> I wondered how truly damaged Silver Patriot was , if anything could be done for him . Maybe Doc Gillen knew some trick to fur him up . Doc Gillen had been around forever . I thought of him looking over those tire tracks and eyeballing me and demanding some answers . When I was almost up to my house , I decided whatever was wrong with Silver Patriot could not be fixed . <p> I waited by the paddock where my horse was lying . I did n't turn when I heard the car coming up . After the engine died and the door opened , there was Doc Kirkland 's voice . I 'd been standing there watching the sunrise , Silver Patriot 's rib cage rising and falling in the high grass , lost in my own thoughts . <p> Kirkland walked over to me . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , like it had been powdered . " They said you called for me ! " he said while still a few feet away . He looked out to where I was looking now . " Wow ! " he said , " What happened ? " <p> " I came down to feed this morning and found him like that , " I said . <p> " Looks like somebody ran over him , " he said . <p> I faced Kirkland . " I came out , " I said , " Down here to feed . The horse was in the paddock . I think he must 've slipped in the grass or something . " <p> " Looks like he got hit by a car , " Kirkland said , again . I stepped closer . " You 're the man here , Doc , " I said . " A man 's farm is riding on this . " <p> He pushed up his lower lip and nodded . " But you 're leaving , right ? " <p> " I 'm not talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skiles , the guy who 's buying this place . If he does n't collect his insurance on this horse , he wo n't put any more horses on this farm . " He stared blankly at me . " Jesus , he 'll probably subdivide it . We 've got to keep together here now , you and I. " <p> " You 're leaving , " he said , " You can say what you want . " <p> " All I 'm saying is that you and I have to be on the same page here , " I said , nodding . " That 's all . " " What am I supposed to say ? " he said . <p> I slapped him on the shoulder . " All you say is that you came here , saw the horse like he is now and drive your Blazer out in the field , right over that path there . " <p> " Why would I do that ? " he said . <p> " You know , " I said , " You did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad injury and all . So , you took the whole truck out there . " Doc frowned . " It 's entirely believable , " I said . He was quiet . <p> " Look , " I said , " Skiles will get his insurance money and he 'll see everyone here plays straight and he 'll want to invest more . He 's an oilman for Chrissake ! He 'll buy horses and have them all over this farm . He 's the kind of man we need ! " I slapped him on the arm now . " You both ate ! " <p> Doc winced . " Maybe nobody will believe my story , " <p> " As soon as you drive out there , your story is the truth , " I said . <p> Doc looked out to the horse . " What do I do again ? " he said . <p> " You drive over that path there , " I said . " Pull around to the other side of the horse , right over the tracks . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over that path and this farm will be full of horses again . Not a bad trade , right ? But we need to go on and do it . The others will be here any minute . " <p> He tilted his head and shaded his eyes with a big hand . The sun was rising , and I was already thinking about Florida . " So what happens to you ? " he said . <p> " Hell , I 'll be around , " I said . He stared at me and nodded . " I might start another place up myself . " <p> " All right , " he said . <p> " Better get in your truck now , " I said . He did that . He had a cordless phone in there like most vets . I 'd call Skiles again to make sure his insurance man was on the way . I 'd do it out in the center of the field with my horse breathing hard at my feet . <p> I decided to stay in Kentucky until the Queen came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'd said to Kirkland about hanging around . In selling , you do at some point have to say something that is the truth , though all you have to do there is understand your buyer 's beliefs and appeal to them . That is the trick , that will always be the trick . <p> I stayed in a motel outside Lexington called the Kent , about fifteen miles north of the racetrack . I took a room around the back , kept the car parked there . I brought all the trophies from the trunk of the car into my room and set them in various places : a silver plate atop the television where I kept my liquor bottles ; a half-dozen julep cups over on the bathroom sink ; two gold bowls I cracked peanut shells into one night while watching a ballgame , Reds vs . Pirates . <p> The Queen came to the racetrack on a Saturday and like everyone else who wanted to see her , I had to wait in line to buy a ticket . That was a cold Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweed , wool , or corduroy left , so I put on four pairs of socks and underwear . A couple T-shirts , one button-down and a khaki coat added to that still were n't enough , but I figured after this day was over , it would be . <p> I paid my bill at the motel that Saturday morning , packed my bags and left the trophies in the room . I gauged how far south I 'd be able to drive after the races before having to pull over for the night . Northern Georgia , I guessed . <p> I left the motel for the tack , sat in traffic awhile , and got to the track right before the second ace . The grandstand was packed inside because of the Queen and the cold . The newspaper had said she would be coming to the saddling ring before one race , though it did n't say which one . It had n't been the first . I asked the first three people I saw . <p> After the fifth had been run , even the stalwarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the glassed-in sections of the grandstand . I thought she was n't coming at all then , though I stayed outside drinking bourbons . <p> Finally , right before the eighth , after the horses left the saddling area for the track , six men surrounding one woman in a powder-blue dress and pillbox hat came quickly across the grounds , right in front of everyone pressed up against the huge grandstand windows . People standing ten deep leaned closer , craned their necks , their breath heavy on the cold glass . The windows fogged . For a second , the Queen stopped and stuck a short arm in the air and smiled at them , those who were inching closer as they were fading away . <p>
