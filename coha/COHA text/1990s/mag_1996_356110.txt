Bill Zanker , 42 , is one of those quirky entrepreneurs always on the lookout for the Next Great Idea . Jogging through San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park one day , he spotted a man offering massages for $1 a minute . " He was dirty , he looked homeless , and yet people were lined up , " recalls Zanker . " I thought , ' What a great idea . ' " Browsing the Sharper Image , he found an array of massage-related products that sent his mind spinning . Thought he : " There 's got to be a way to bring stress reduction to the masses . " Eureka ! Zanker opened the first Great American BackRub store in 1993 in Manhattan . <P> Taking what he calls " the McRub approach , " the hyperkinetic Zanker merged the retail concept with the massage-notions business to create a chain that sells fast , convenient  --  and fully clothed  --  massages and massage gadgets . Last February Zanker raised $6.2 million in a public offering . Today there are 15 branches in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to open mainly through franchises in eight new markets . Says he : " I see it as the Starbucks of the year 2000 . We could put one every two to three blocks . " Now you know why he 's an entrepreneur . <P> Long relegated to the ranks of sybaritic pleasure or illicit sex , massage is emerging as a form of body maintenance . Americans spend $24 billion a year to cure back pain . GABR masseurs are licensed and receive company training to standardize treatment . A 10-min. back rub costs $14.95 , a 45-min. version $49.95 . Says Mary Trudel , 43 , who works in a Manhattan public relations firm : " I eat lunch at my desk and come in here for a treat . After a 10-min. rub , I feel relaxed and rejuvenated . " <P> Investors , however , have felt some back pain . The stock ( RUBB ) opened on NASDAQ at $5 , yet closed last week at $3.75 . Revenues through the third quarter ( $1.97 million ) nearly tripled last year 's , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , selling franchises that cost between $69,950 and $134,000 a pop . <P> Is RUBB for real ? Zanker has felt the entrepreneurial tide turn against him before . He founded the Learning Annex , an adult-education business , but overexpansion and mounting lawsuits led him to sell his stake in a prepackaged bankruptcy in 1991 . But competing massage outfits like Healing Hands of New York City are opening up shop , a good sign , says Zanker . " It 's a huge market  --  you know how many backs there are in America ? 263,814,032 , to be exact  --  and we ca n't possibly do them all . " No , but he can sure try . <P>  --  By Stacy Perman
