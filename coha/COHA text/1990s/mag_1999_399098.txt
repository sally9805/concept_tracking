Searching for the landlubbing ancestors of marine mammals <p> Only 24 years after Charles Darwin rewrote the book of life with his theory of natural selection , a fellow Victorian scientist named William Flower trained this powerful new idea on one of the toughest problems in zoology : the whale . Natural historians had long before recognized that whales are mammals , but that was about as far as they had come in understanding the origins of cetaceans . How evolution had managed to craft such a unique beast presented a mystery as vast as the creature itself . <p> In 1883 , Flower offered an idea that-on the face of it-seemed positively daft . The legless leviathans , he suggested , had evolved from mammals known as ungulates , a group whose best-known characteristic is a set of hoofed feet . In other words , dolphins , porpoises , humpbacks , orcas , and all other whales are close kin of cows , horses , pigs , and related barnyard stock . <p> More than a century after Flower raised his audacious hypothesis , it no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies over the past 3 decades have convinced biologists that cetaceans are the progeny of hoofed mammals . Yet the whale 's story is far from finished . <p> Two opposing groups of scientists are currently battling over the next chapter in the saga . They clash on the issue of exactly where whales fit in the tree of hoofed mammals . Far from just an arcane argument , the debate has much to say about how whales made the profound transformation from life on land to mastery of another medium . <p> What 's more , the skirmish documents the intense Darwinian struggle shaping the science of biology as it evolves . The war over whales pits the classical techniques of studying bones and flesh against the most modern methods of genetic analysis-two approaches that lead to different versions of the whale 's origin tale . <p> " This is one of the fundamental questions right now , " says Patrick Luckett , an embryologist at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan and a coeditor of the Journal of Mammalian Evolution . " This is something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy . " <p> The most recent genetic evidence , reported in August , provides the strongest support yet for the hypothesis that whales and hippopotamuses are first cousins . If true , this would slice these marine animals from their long-standing position on the mammal family tree and graft them onto a different branch . It would also suggest that the ancestor of whales and hippos may have ventured into the water more than 55 million years ago . <p> From the fossil bones , however , paleontologists see no need to cut into the mammalian tree . Hippos , they say , are only distant relatives of whales , no closer than are deer , pigs , or other even-toed ungulates . <p> For Charles Darwin , whales represented a major case of heartburn . The famed naturalist had no trouble envisioning whales evolving from four-legged mammals , but his audience certainly did . <p> In his Origin of Species , Darwin notes a case of a black bear swimming for hours with its mouth agape , catching aquatic insects much as a whale might feed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered , by natural selection , more aquatic in their structure and habits , with larger and larger mouths , till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale , " he speculated . <p> The ridicule and attacks engendered by this passage grew to such a pitch that Darwin pared it down and then deleted it altogether in later editions . <p> Although Darwin got the particulars wrong , his swimming-bear scenario was not far off the mark . Modern molecular biologists say that they now have the unassailable evidence to track whales ' origins among four-legged mammals . <p> In the Aug. 31 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a team of Japanese and U.S. researchers used one of the newest types of genetic analysis to track the phylogeny , or relationships , among some mammals . The group focused on whales and members of the order Artiodactyla , the group that paleontologists in recent years have considered whales ' closest living relatives . Artiodactyls are hoofed animals that have an even number of toes on each foot , such as pigs , giraffes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology and his colleagues examined a part of the animals ' genetic code that does n't specify instructions for any genes . Some of this so-called junk DNA is made up of segments that can copy themselves and then splice the copies back into the genetic strands at various points . One group of these mobile elements consists of short interspersed elements , or SINEs ; long interspersed elements , or LINEs , form another . <p> Such segments have been insinuating themselves into the code of life for billions of years , says Okada . " In the case of the human genome , SINEs constitute more than 10 percent of the genome , and LINEs constitute more than 15 percent , " he says . <p> Usually harmless , these segments have an uncanny ability to co-opt the DNA-copying apparatus in cells , and they may have played a role in spawning some viruses . " Retroviruses , such as the AIDS viruses , were believed to have been generated from LINEs , " says Okada . <p> Though SINEs and LINEs may fulfill no useful mission in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in mapping the twists and turns of evolution . By looking for particular examples of these copies in specific sites of the genome , researchers can determine when various species split off from related ones . <p> In the recent study , Okada and his colleagues found that all artiodactyls are not equally related to whales , as paleontologists have long maintained . Instead , hippos and whales share four SINEs not present in the other artiodactyls tested-camels , pigs , deer , giraffes , and cows . Since hippos are clearly artiodactyls , whales would also deserve bona fide membership in the same order , rather than simply being cousins to artiodactyls , as paleontologists would have it . <p> Molecular biologists have found evidence of a link between whales and hippos before , but Okada 's technique has much more power than the conventional analysis of gene sequences , says Daniel Graur of Tel Aviv University in Israel . " Okada 's ruining my livelihood . He 'll put me out of business , " jokes Graur , who analyzes genes . <p> In the standard method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequences of genes in several species of organisms . Because the sequences change slowly over time , they should look more similar in closely related species-deer and antelope-than they do in more distant species-deer and pig . <p> This technique is n't foolproof . It goes awry when the same mutation happens independently in two different species . This kind of event , a molecular version of convergent evolution , makes two animals ' sequences look similar even though they may be only distantly related . What 's more , a mutation in one spot can change again or even correct itself , further muddling comparisons of sequences . <p> Scientists who analyze gene sequences try to get around this problem by considering many different genes , each of which represents a string of hundreds to thousands of individual DNA bases-the four letters in the genetic alphabet . <p> In contrast to standard sequencing , analysis of SINEs and LINEs presents a nearly perfect record of evolutionary change , says Okada . In 10 years of study , he has never found an example of these elements appearing independently in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DNA . " I am 100 percent confident with the conclusion that the most closely related species to whales , among extant mammals , is the hippo , " Okada says . <p> Other molecular biologists agree that the SINE and LINE data add weight to the idea of a close relationship between whales and hippos , but many say that the connection was already firmly established by conventional genetic data . " Every gene I 've ever sequenced says the same thing . The molecular data is all fairly consistent , " says John Gatesy of the University of Wyoming in Laramie , one of the first who reported the whale-hippo connection . Some researchers have taken to calling this the whippo hypothesis . <p> For molecular biologists , the whale story is one of the clearest evolutionary tales they have to tell . Sometime more than 55 million years ago , the artiodactyl ancestors of whales and hippos split off from other groups that would lead to camels , pigs , deer , and cows . The whippo lineage may have developed a watery lifestyle even before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both groups share particular aquatic adaptations , such as the ability to nurse and communicate underwater . <p> " There 's an awful lot of people who feel the data are so strong and so compelling , there is n't any question about it , " says David M. Hillis of the University of Texas at Austin . <p> Scientists who study whale fossils , however , have several bones to pick with that attitude . <p> " I think that 's an unfair dismissal of the paleontological data , and it 's just unwise not to consider the fact that the fossil record is in contradiction to the molecular data , " says Maureen O'Leary , a paleontologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook . One of these two sets of information is yielding the wrong answer , and scientists do n't know which , she says . <p> The biggest problem with the molecular approach , she says , is that it considers only a few living examples of related species , leaving out the 90 percent that have gone extinct . Seen against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pattern emerges . <p> Since the 1960s , paleontologists have drawn strong evolutionary connections between whales and an extinct group of ungulates called mesonychians . Looking a little like a wolf with hooves , mesonychians had an unusual set of teeth that resemble those of ancient whales . Unlike all other ungulates , which have flattened molars with cusps for grinding plants , whales and mesonychians have bladelike molars presumably useful for tearing meat . <p> " Whales and mesonychids among ungulates seem to be unique in that they resemble carnivorous animals , " says O'Leary . <p> If mesonychians are the nearest known relatives to whales , however , whales could n't fit next to hippos within the artiodactyls . The problem lies in the ankle . Mesonychians lack a specialized joint there that serves as one of the defining features of artiodactyls . <p> In all known members of this order , an ankle bone called the astragalus has a pulley-shaped knob at each end . That provides more freedom for flexing the foot up and down and limits twisting from side to side , says paleontologist J.G.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rootstown . Their unique astragalus helps artiodactyls bound over rough terrain without dislocating their ankles . <p> If the ankles of mesonychians wo n't give them membership among artiodactyls , then their presumed close relatives , the cetaceans , should not fit , either , reason paleontologists . One way to test this hypothesis would be to take a look at a whale astragalus , but evolution has made that difficult . <p> Modern whales have only vestiges of leg bones and lack astragali . Thewissen and his colleagues have therefore tried to find examples of this bone in fossils of ancient whale species that had true hind legs . " We all thought that once we had found the astragalus from a whale , we would solve the problem , " says Thewissen . <p> He recently discovered such a key while prospecting in Pakistan for bones from the earliest known whales , members of a 50-million-year-old family called pakicetids . The key , though , turned out to have the wrong shape to unlock the solution . The pakicetid astragalus does n't clearly resemble a mesonychid ankle or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's sort of a letdown , " he says . <p> Other questions cloud the issue further . In part , Thewissen identified the Pakistani astragalus as belonging to a pakicetid whale because no other animal in those deposits could lay claim to a bone of that size . However , the astragalus was not clearly part of a pakicetid skeleton , so some paleontologists wonder whether it belonged to an animal other than an ancient whale . <p> In an attempt to break the deadlock over whale origins , some of the opponents in the debate are joining forces . O'Leary and Gatesy are just starting out on a massive phylogenetic project that will combine genetic information with morphological data describing anatomical structures in fossil and living species . Once they put all the details into a database , a computer program will sort out the possible family trees relating the different animals . <p> As yet , the researchers have not figured out how to pull off the daunting task of pooling such dissimilar information . " There are some intricate problems with combining the molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One of the best ways to resolve the controversy , she says , would be to acquire some new information that causes one of the sides to shift its position . In some previous debates regarding the relationship between toothed and baleen whales , additional molecular analyses reversed controversial conclusions of earlier studies . On the other hand , a new whale fossil could show up with feet that belong unmistakably to an artiodactyl . <p> Thewissen has high hopes on the fossil front . " I think we 'll have better fossils that will really bear on this question in the near future , " he says . <p> If so , these bones could ultimately write a conclusion to the story that Darwin and Flower started more than a century ago . <p> By RICHARD MONASTERSKY <p> How evolution led whales into the water <p> Paleontologists once despaired of ever tracing the evolution of whales back to the time when their ancestors walked on land . For much of this century , the fossil record had little to say about the earliest stages in this transition because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home in the sea . <p> Within the past 2 decades , however , a wave of finds has helped fill in the progression from land to water . In 1983 , Philip D. Gingerich of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and his colleagues discovered in Pakistan the skull of the earliest known whale , a 50-million-year-old animal they named Pakicetus . The fossils of several pakicetid whales range from wolf-size to as big as a bear , and they are found in the remains of small , ephemeral streams only about 1 meter deep . <p> Scientists have yet to uncover a full skeleton of one of these whales , but the animals ' ears reveal clues to their lifestyle . " They tell me that they were doing something different than land mammals do , " says J.G.M. Thewissen of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in Rootstown . <p> Thewissen studied the arrangement of ear bones in pakicetids in 1993 and concluded that they were best adapted to hearing through a medium much denser than air . The ears may have worked well underwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water by putting their jaws on the ground as some predators do , he says . <p> In 1994 , Thewissen reported the discovery of a complete skeleton of a whale only slightly more recent than Pakicetus . This creature , which he named Ambulocetus , had limbs that would have been clumsy on land . Its large feet and supple spine allowed the animal to swim by flexing its hind half up and down in a precursor to the type of motion that modern whales use . <p> From the sedimentary deposits in which it was found , researchers can tell that Ambulocetus apparently lived in the ocean close to shore , perhaps near the mouths of rivers where it could get fresh water for drinking . The oxygen isotopes of its bones suggest that this species had n't fully developed the ability to consume seawater as today 's whales do . <p> DIAGRAM : Kissing cousins ?
