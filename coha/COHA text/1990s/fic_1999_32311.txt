Danger on the Road JUDD was stunned . Vicki was gone . " Where is she ? " he demanded . Lionel and Ryan looked up from their spots on the floor before the TV . Ryan shrugged . " There 's a note by the phone . " Judd grabbed it and read quickly . " Hitching to Michigan to see Bub . Back soon . " He slapped the note on his thigh and caught himself before he swore . What was he so mad about ? This was his fault . Vicki had asked him to drive her to see her big brother Eddie 's buddy . Judd refused before he thought about it , telling her he felt responsible for Lionel and Ryan and had better stay with them . " Let them ride along , " Vicki had said . " Nah , " Judd said . " The roads are just starting to reopen . We do n't really know where we 're going . There are rumors school is going to open again , and I 'd hate to be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to school ? " " If it opens , sure . " " Why ? " " Because we have to . " " We have to ? Judd , what are they going to do if we do n't show up ? They 'll figure we disappeared along with thousands of others . Anyway , if Bruce is right and there 's a peace treaty signed between the UN and Israel , we 'll have only seven years left to live . Why would I want to spend half that time in school ? To learn what ? The world is going to hell , and we 'd be sitting in class , trying to prepare for a future that does n't exist . " She had a point . Judd was a junior , but Vicki was a freshman . School did seem like a waste of time , but Judd did n't know what he thought about breaking the law by refusing to go . If it came to that , he assumed they would all go , Lionel and Ryan back to Lincoln Junior High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimated how desperate Vicki was to locate Bub . She had never met him , had only seen pictures and talked to him on the phonethe last time the morning of the Rapture . Her brother had met him when he ran off to work in Michigan after high school . Eddie said he liked Bub at first because he was a wild party kind of a guy . But then Eddie became a Christian . He was n't able to persuade Bub to quit his loose living , but he kept rooming with him anyway . It was Bub who had confirmed to Vicki that Eddie had disappeared in the Rapture . " I 've been having trouble reaching Bub by phone , " she had told Judd . " I want to just go find him . " Judd thought it was a bad idea and said so . He even thought about telling Bruce , but the kids had agreed they were n't going to treat Bruce like a parent . If Judd had known Vicki was going to just leave and hitchhike to Michigan , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out there alone on the road . He felt responsible for her , though he knew he really was n't . The four of them were on their own now . They all lived together in Judd 's house , sure , but it had been their choice to accept his invitation . The only rules were that they would always tell each other where they were . Vicki had fulfilled that requirement . Judd missed Vicki . There was no other way to say it . It was n't that he was interested in her romantically . At least not yet . He had n't decided how he felt about her in that way . But she was the easiest person in the house to talk to . She would turn fifteen before he turned seventeen , so they were n't quite two years apart . Lionel was only thirteen and Ryan twelve , so although they were boys , Judd usually chose to talk with Vicki . But she was gone , at least for a while . He worried about her . Judd liked having Vicki around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They squabbled all the time . Judd told himself he did n't care , but they got on his nerves . He knew they were like brothers and that down deep they liked each other and probably loved each other as brothers in Christ . They just did n't act like it . Lionel , who had been raised in a Christian home , was a know-it-all who treated Ryan like a dummy . Well , what did Lionel expect from a kid who had hardly been to church ? The whole thing made Judd feel old . Here he was , suddenly without parents , and he was worried about people who lived with him and for whom he felt responsible . All this in just a couple of weeks . It was too bizarre . * * * Vicki feared she had made a mistake as soon as she caught the attention of the driver of an eighteen-wheeler . She had been praying that a family would give her a ride . If not a family , then a couple . If not a couple , then a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awaited her approach . She could have easily ignored him , but , after all , she had been standing there with her thumb out . She prayed as she approached the passenger side . At the trailer park she had grown up in , a friend was a truck driver . So she knew how to mount the steps , open the door , and swing herself inside . But with the door open , Vicki froze . This driver was a man , and he already had a passengeranother man . She smelled alcohol and both men held beer cans . " Well , well , well , " the passenger said , " lookie what we got here ! " He was young and blond with close-cropped hair , and he wore a sleeveless tee shirt despite the chilly evening . He offered her his free hand , but she hesitated , one hand on the door handle , the other on the side of the cab . The man smiled and she smelled his breath . " C'm on in , honey . You can sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver said . " We 'll take a lady like you anywhere you want to go ! " He was muscular and sweaty . " I was , uh , just wondering how far it is to Mount Prospect , " Vicki said . There was no way she 'd ride with these two . " You know good and well where it is , " the passenger said . " You had your thumb out there , honey . Now , where to ? " " Nowhere , " she said and began to step back down . " No you do n't , sweetie , " the young man said , and he pushed the door wide open . Vicki hung from the handle and dangled high off the ground . He pulled the door back toward him , and Vicki had to act . The last thing she wanted was to get close enough for him to reach her . She let go and dropped to the ground . " Thanks anyway , " she called out , heading toward the back of the truck as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy the truckers when the door opened again and the man bounded out , sloshing his beer can as he did . Vicki slipped in the gravel and tried to run , her heart thundering . She was no match for a man that size . As she desperately prayed she realized how stupid she had been to take off on her own . What had she been thinking ? The man was gaining on her when another truck rolled off the side of the road , the skidding tires kicking up dust . Vicki found herself next to the passenger door of that vehicle as it flew open . Now what ? She was relieved to see this driver was alone and older , probably in his sixties , big , barrel-chested , and with a week 's growth of white whiskers . His smile disarmed her . " You ought to be careful , hitchikin ' by yourself these days , little lady , " he said . " Can you help me ? " she said . " What 's the trouble ? " She pointed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned tail and was climbing back into the other truck . Taking no chances , Vicki leaped aboard the new truck . " Where you going ? " the old trucker said . " Michigan , " she said , noticing a leather cross dangling from the CB radio mounted above the dash . " I can get you as far as Michigan City , Indiana , " he said . " How 'll that be ? " " An answer to prayer , " she said . The old man was shifting into one gear after the other every few feet , getting back up to speed as he pulled back onto the road . When he finally had the rig in the right lane and rolling with the heavy traffic , he cocked his head and stared at Vicki . " Did you say that just to get next to me , ' cause you saw the cross ? Or are you really a woman of prayer ? " " I am now , " she said . He chuckled and turned his gaze back at the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Call me Deacon . " " Deacon ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " Are you a deacon ? " " Actually no . But once I found the Lord and started telling everybody on the squawk box , they started calling me Deacon . I 'm a little zealous I guess you might say . " " Me too . " " You a believer , Miss ? " " Vicki , " she said . " With an I " " Well , praise the Lord , Vicki with an I. Tell me your story and I 'll tell you mine . " Vicki ran down her whole history before Deacon reached the state line . The ride was punctuated by occasional static from the CB radio , words she could just barely make out . " That you , Deacon ? " came one interruption . " This here 's the Fat Fox . " " Hey , Fatty , how ya doin ' , come back . " " Seventy-threes to you , Deke . Still totin ' the Lord ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too if you wan na survive the flip side . " " I got the whole sermon the other day , Deacon , " the other man said . " Just saying hey . " " Well , hey back , Fox . Do n't be making the Lord wait on you too long now , you hear ? I want to be calling you brother next time I see you . " Deacon explained to Vicki that he liked to preach over the citizens ' band radio . A lot of drivers were scared and curious since the vanishings . " I take a lot of heat for it from some . They tell me to put a lid on it or save it for Sunday , but it 's way too late to be ashamed of God , do n't you think ? " Vicki nodded . " Did you not believe before , or did you just not know ? " " I knew . My mother , God rest her soul , told me every day of her life . But I blamed God because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me too . I hated him till the day he died , and I always thought she deserved better than a man like that . I quit going to church fifty years ago and never went back . She sent me verses and reminders and letters and prayers every month until she died a couple of years ago . I almost got saved at her funeral . I knew what they were saying was the truth , but I figured that if I came to Jesus I would have too much apologizing to do . Three former wives , you know . " Vicki wondered why he thought she 'd know . " Anyway , my last wife became a Christian about six months after she left me . She wanted to come back , make things right , clean me up , get my life straightened out . I did n't want any part of it . She warned me that Jesus would come back and I would n't be ready . Boy , was she right ! When everybody disappeared , I only needed to know one thing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she was gone , leavin ' her waitress uniform right where she stood , I knew it was true . I knew what to do , who to pray to , and what to say . " " Me too , " Vicki said . " Quit drinking and smoking too . " Deacon tilted his head back and roared with laughter . " You got off the sauce and the cancer sticks when you got saved too , did you ? " " Yes , sir ! " He laughed louder . " Is that a fact ? " " Yes , it is , and I do n't think it 's funny . Why are you laughing ? " He wiped his eyes and down shifted . " I 'm sorry , sweetheart , " he said . " You just do n't hit me as the hard-livin ' type , if you know what I mean . " " You should have seen me three weeks ago , " she said . " I never thought I would look like this , talk like this , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trash . " " Grew up in a park ? " " Yes , sir . Prospect Gardens . " " I know the place . No garden , is it ? " " Never was . Asphalt and dirt . " " And some indoor/outdoor , right ? " " Sir ? " " That plastic indoor/outdoor carpeting that 's supposed to fool people into thinking you 've got a yard ? " She laughed . " We sure enough had a slab of that ourselves , " she said . Vicki told him of the trailers that had burned , and of her brother 's friend Bub , who had been left behind . Deacon was quiet for a few miles and appeared thoughtful . " Ever wonder if he does n't want to be found ? " he said finally . Vicki shrugged . " It does n't make any difference . It 's like God put him in my heart and I have to be sure he knows the truth . " " Not everybody reacts well , you know , " Deacon said . Vicki nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him . " Deacon told her that he would n't feel right about leaving her at the Michigan state line , not knowing whether she got a ride to Portage . " I 'll sit with you as long as I can at the truck stop there , " he said . " I want to make sure you catch a ride with somebody I know and trust . " " Thank you , Deacon , " she said . * * * Judd wished Vicki had told him she was going with or without him . He would have at least made her promise to call him once in a while so he 'd know she was all right . Now how would he get word to her about school ? Loudspeakers began blaring late Friday night , informing residents to tune in certain radio and TV emergency-broadcast stations . " Local schools will reopen a week from tomorrow , " came the announcements , " and those stations will carry the details . " " What details ? " Ryan said , and he and Lionel joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out , stupid , " Lionel said . " I just figured you 'd know , genius , " Ryan said . " Knock it off , you two , " Judd said . " I want to hear this . " " We already know what they 're going to say , " Lionel said . " We know when , we know where , and we know what . School . Yuck . " " You both go to Lincoln , right ? " Judd said . Lionel nodded . " Me too , " Ryan said . " But we 're not in the same classes . " " At least I have something to be thankful for , " Lionel said . Judd shushed them as the list of schools came up . As the names of junior highs scrolled past , Judd read , " Formerly Lincoln Junior High , now Global Community Middle School . " Lionel seemed to flinch . " Why would they do that ? " he said . " Change a perfectly good name . I liked going to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . " I 'll get it , " Ryan said . Judd let him as he watched the high school listings . But the station did better than just list the openings . The news of Prospect High was accompanied by film footage of the changing of the sign out front . " It 's for you , " Ryan said from the kitchen phone . " Judd ! " Judd heard him but did n't respond . He stood , stating at the screen . A cherry picker and crane on the back of a truck hoisted a workman to the Prospect High sign . As Ryan nagged him from the kitchen , Judd saw the man on TV trade one sheet of plastic for another that slid in front of the lights on the sign . Prospect High was no longer . His school would now be known as Nicolae Carpathia High . The sports mascot would also be changed . The teams formerly known as the Knights would now be the Doves . " C'm on , Judd ! " Ryan whined . " It 's Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
