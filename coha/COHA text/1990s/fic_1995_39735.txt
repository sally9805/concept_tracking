WE HAVE IT NOW before us and know at least that it is n't any dream . The name is plain enough , written down in the old guidebook of the state I just yesterday found by accident on the shelves . The book was done by WPA commission back in the Depression . But where did that name come from Out of the Bible , like Sharon ( rose of ) , Mizpah , Gennesaret , Galilee , or Gilead ( balm of ) No , probably an Indian name  --  what tribe Read further . We find that it was an old Mississippi town , long since absorbed into another one . I know no one who remembers it . But the name , though I dream about it , is a real name . In the dream I know its reality without doubt , though when waking I doubt and am glad to have it proved . Once I see it proved , I can return to the dream . I can see it all . <p> There is a large house of mellow old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking sun , and an entrance at the side with a small portico . Seldom used , it matches in a minor , modest way the imposing front portico . Here wasps may have built in the overhang , or large bright-colored flies , trapped , may have died and fallen in the space between the outer door and the screen . The door is hard to pull inward , the wood having swollen after many rains , and the screen sticks at the bottom , so that a sharp kick is needed to help it along . <p> Now go into the garden . It is like this . A sunken garden laid out in a rectangle , slightly shorter and narrower than a tennis court . A low slope of grass , trimly mowed , frames it on every side . There are four sets of three steps each , with low balustrades . Each terminates in a square flagstone plateau , a place for setting out pairs of clay plots for flowering plants , or ornamental urns in a classical design . On one side there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet high , a copy of something Roman . He has no mate ; the space for one is bare . There is a fountain in the center , composed only of four equal spray heads , slanting upward , not often turned on . But there is water in the shallow rectangular pool , and lily pads at one end , at the other a few lazy goldfish , with one ordinary lake fish , gray among their brilliance , dropped there from the sky or by someone who caught it and judged it too small to eat . Life spared , it swims with a strange race . Such is its destiny . <p> At the far end of the sunken garden there is a stone bench with scrolled arms . It looks to be for ornament only , as if no one had ever actually sat on it . But I go and sit on it anyway . This visit must be complete . <p> Let me say who I am . I said " we " at first because I wanted to include you , whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Shongalo , you may be among those who should . It is mysterious . It is beautiful . Even in the full glare of Mississippi July afternoon sun , it raises questions no one will remember to ask , and if they do , and if someone begins to answer , an interruption will occur , and no one will recall afterwards what was being said . <p> There , I have done it too . Started to say who I am , then got interrupted by another train of thought . Well , I 'll start again . <p> I 'm nobody really . A teacher from the town . One of the children here , a girl in my class during the school year , which concluded two months ago , admired me , favored me , liked being my student . Nothing would do but an invitation here , where before I had been invited only once , for Sunday dinner , nothing so exciting as a dinner party . She persisted . Miss Weldon must have a chance to visit during the summer . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country club pool , we could talk some more , and I could get to know her brother , home from school , her parents , and maybe even a cousin or two , some well known , even from as far away as Washington . They came in the summer , at intervals . <p> My thoughts were wary . I wondered how I would be treated . A student 's enthusiasm in no way makes a haughty family democratic . Would n't the favored teacher role set me in a category : poor relation ? The decision to chunk me whole into that box would be so immediate they would never stop to think about it . Not saying it , but making me feel it . Yet my clothes were in good taste , and my manners beyond criticism . Money ? Was that what gave me pause It was obviously not plentiful or I would n't be teaching in a Mississippi high school . And what about my single status ? Matter of choice  --  mine or others ' ? Whom does she " go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring up , but everyone would think them anyway . Better they would be asked openly , like some impossibly bad visiting boy cousin who belched at the table or jumped out of stairwell closets in the dark . <p> Nevertheless , the following was true : I had gone back for the summer to my hometown , a hundred miles to the south . I was completing work on a thesis for a graduate degree . The town was named Stubbins , Mississippi . It was dull and hot and tiresome . So I accepted Maida 's invitation . Her mother had Mitten as well  --  swirling initials engraved on ivory notepaper , confidently scrawled script . Using plain but decent drugstore notepaper , I replied . I could drive there as suggested on a Thursday , planning to stay for the weekend . I tried not to pack my misgivings with my clothes . I came . <p> So why was I all alone on a hot Friday afternoon , out in the sunken garden , sitting on the stone bench , observing the pool ? Everyone was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to my room ( air conditioner in the window , cool high ceilings , four-poster bed , ruffled snow-white pillow shams ) , agreeing to nap also , but wanting a book , any book , I drifted downstairs . If there were bookshelves , a library somewhere , they were hard to find . The house was silent , as though they 'd all gone off and died . Far out on a corner of the front porch , under the shade of the portico , beyond the line of ferns , a large dog was sleeping . A stranger , I hesitated to go that way . He might rouse up , bark , disturb them all . My books were in my car , parked somewhere out back on a large sweep of gravel near the yawning mouth of a garage . I had come out the side door , seen the garden , been tempted to wander and explore . <p> What lingers in some of us , in me , of the child exploring the mysterious castle , the chateau we took refuge in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a winding road that a mistaken turn has led us on to follow ? Once it is seen there , the feeling comes : " I am no stranger here . " I mean to say that houses like this were part of my heritage , and since I had never lived in one , they were to be possessed only in this way of wandering , a native not to be told she was n't to explore . For what was I exploring in this case but my own spiritual property ? <p> But , hindering , there was the heat . Just like Stubbins . Something stung my ankle , sweat glazed my eyes . The nap here was a required ritual I should be observing . I would try it tomorrow . From the sunken garden I went toward the back where the cars were parked , crunching through gravel as softly as possible , for one or two windows , high above , were open . I sorted out a book or two from the backseat of my own modest Ford and returned , entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the corner of my eye as I passed was now developing . Could it have been the tail end of a strange car I thought so . I thought I had seen the sleekly tapered rear of something decidedly foreign . I did n't go back to check on it . The sight gave me , for no good reason , a start , a qualm , as if someone had come on purpose to unsettle things . To threaten ? <p> Maybe I was wrong . Even if right , why feel it as disturbing I tiptoed through the dining room , its windows shuttered against the heat , the long cherry table polished and quiet , not yet set for dinner . The chairs were arranged symmetrically back against the walls . The doors throughout the house towered high above my head . I pushed open the door between dining room and hall . There was the stair , ready to lead me up to my room . But still wondering where they kept their books , thinking that I remembered Maida , my student , mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal living room . Last night before dinner we had sat in the less formal room adjacent to the dining room . Chairs and sofas there were slipcovered in cool , faded fabric ; furniture in the formal room wore satin , draperies were in lustrous brocade . <p> Perhaps my real reason was just to see the room once more , meditatively , alone . Its proportions had struck me as beautiful . There was ornamental scrollwork around the moldings , and a medallion of similar design on the ceiling surrounded the hanging point of the chandelier . A round table of inlaid polished wood stood central to the room beneath the chandelier , and a man was bending over it , his back to me . He was pulling out one of the drawers , or closing it . He turned : a stranger . We looked at each other . He was tall and rather messily dressed in a long-sleeved shirt but no tie , rumpled tan trousers , loafers . His hair was light , fading to gray His expression , however , was dark , annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had every right to ask that . <p> " Just a visitor , " I said . " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean .... " Just what did n't I mean ? " I mean , I did n't know you were here . " <p> He laughed in an odd way , somewhere between amused and scornful . " You still do n't , do you I mean , you do n't know who I am . " <p> " That 's true , " I said . I supposed he wanted me to go , but when I reached for the door he said , " Wait . " I turned back and he said , " Come here ... closer . " <p> " What is it ? " I said , moving halfway toward him . <p> " No one ... nobody knows I 'm here . I 'd rather they did n't . " Then he smiled . Charming . He wanted something . " I 'd rather you did n't mention it . " That was it . <p> " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ; that is , if I 'm not supposed to mention you . " <p> " I 'm just a cousin , " he said . " That will have to do . " <p> " Would n't they want to see you ? " <p> " Well , sometimes they might . It depends . " He glanced up and around , as though regarding the whole large structure : Shongalo . Its vast shoulders sturdily asleep in the full afternoon light . " Nap time , " he remarked , returning his gaze to me . " It never fails . Come at nap time , you wo n't see anybody . You , too  --  you 're supposed to be napping . " <p> " I just wanted something to read . Do you know where they keep the books " <p> The smile again . " You 've got some in your hand . " <p> " I mean theirs . These are mine . " <p> " The books  --  oh , yes . " He swung away , quickly , on his heel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He opened a door I had n't noticed ; it adjoined the small fireplace with its cold grate protected by curved bars . " Here . " He beckoned . I came and looked inside . The room was oblong , running along the right flank of the house , with two shuttered windows set equidistant from the center of the outer wall . The shelves were all around , between the windows , covering the walls , on either side of the door . A table with a reading lamp was central , and two straight chairs were drawn up to it , facing . Two others stood in the corners I stepped across the threshold , following , and looked admiringly up at the shelves , which were pressed to overflowing with row after row of books . I could see at a glance there was no special arrangement given them , except perhaps way up high where the bound sets were ranked . <p> I went further inside . He pulled at a shutter , letting in a tilt of light . I could see the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond . I was turning to stare all around , upward at the sets of Dickens and Scott , medium height to biographies and novels , then downward to encyclopedia in rows and piled-up National Geographics , when I noticed he had moved away from the window . Leaving ? Well , he had mentioned haste . <p> But then I sensed him right behind me and turned directly into him , astonished , but with a sense of rightness in being exactly there . His smile close up had a quality I was wanting , without knowing it , to find  --  that of letting himself be just himself . The scorn was out of it . <p> " A pretty woman here . " Marveling , he almost laughed , the way he might at sudden luck , that being how he meant it , I had to conclude . <p> The room needed airing . The book smell was dense . I stood still as he raked a careful finger around my hairline , damp from heat , just as my lip would be beaded . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a plane ? Wander off the road ? " <p> " Teacher , " I said ; one word was all I had breath for . The pull of kissing had come to both of us at once . It was what we did . " Maida 's , " I murmured , my hand resting naturally on his shoulder . " You must know her . " <p> " Lord , that little brat . Well ... it 's all for the best . " I did n't ask what he meant . Later , I pondered it through the years . It may be that it was just a phrase . It did n't have to mean anything . What was for the best Something to do with Maida or with himself ? " Please tell me ... " I began , about to ask him any number of things . But all he did was kiss me again . The only time I moved was to set the books down on the table , so as to free my arms . I still have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could only mean looking at his watch . " What a cryin ' shame . " <p> He moved away , toward the door , but turned to me again , looking as intent as anyone ever had since time began . " Remember you 're not to mention me , please ma'am . " Then he smiled in a different way . " Can you possibly help it ? " He had brought his distance back , gathered it all in . Then he left . <p> I stood stock-still for long moments in the sought-for room full of books , but after hearing the muted rustle of gravel as his car backed cautiously and turned , the roll of tires past the windows and their dwindling sound , I still could not break with the room where this unexpected magic had occurred , but circled about it like a trapped bee . I might well have buzzed , but did n't know how . I heard the house waking , the creak of beds , the shuffle of footsteps . Leave Yes , I must . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallway , seeing her come pattering down the stairs . <p> " Oh , there you are . I was calling you . " <p> " I hope you do n't mind if I explored . " <p> " Course not . Want to get your suit ? We 'll drive in and swim . " <p> " Where ? " I was dazed and languid , as if more had happened . <p> " At the club . You know . It 's not all that far . I told you . " <p> Maida Stratton was blond and plump , a bouncy girl , always looking about ready to laugh . When first seen last September at the start of school , I had put her down in my mental notes as possibly dumb , or one of those students with native intelligence who , try as I might , would not be induced to proper study . Later , discussing stories and poems that we read together , assigned or introduced in class , her perceptions astonished me . They were quick and sure . " Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " Did n't he feel he was lots better than the girl he was with " " Are n't they really trying to hide something ? " She would get the point , quick as a blink . And make it sound easy . Her hair was long and untidy ; she wore it bound back in a little scarf . Pieces kept slipping through and getting in the way as she bent to write something . But her homework was neat , brief , intelligent . High school English was her favorite class , she told me with a blush , turning a paper in . " Has n't it always been your favorite ? " I asked . A gulp . Then , " Mainly just since you came . " That touched me . The Sunday dinner invitation came not long after . Mrs. Stratton sent a note to me at school . " Mother sent you this , " Maida said . She turned and almost ran away . It is painful to be young . <p> We drove to the club in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance gates , Maida , silent till then , began to talk rapidly . She was reading the Ibsen play I had given her . She loved reading plays . She could visualize how the scene might look before her on the stage . " Or a movie screen , " I said . <p> " No ! I 'd rather imagine the stage ... me in the audience . " That refreshing giggle . " You could be there , too , long as I 'm imagining . " <p> " Why not on the stage ... you , I mean " <p> " Maybe later I 'll think about it . But in Norway they have a lot of old dark furniture . They have stuffy old parlors , I bet . " <p> " Why stuffy " <p> " It 's cold there . They 'd have to keep the windows closed , would n't they ? I bet they all have colds . " <p> At the pool she dove and splashed , greeted her friends , laughed a lot . But her delight , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher now becoming her friend . A breathless change . " Yes , I 'm from Stubbins , " I kept saying , to some I had n't met , home for the summer . Then I had to explain where it was . These south Mississippi towns might have been out west as far as the Delta mentality went . " Is n't that near Wimbly ? " one boy asked , and everyone laughed . I said that it was . He had only said that because the names were funny . What did they recognize except each other ? Maida confided on the way home that her father had wanted to have a swimming pool put in at Shongalo , but gave up the idea . " He did n't know how he would keep the poor children out . He 'd hate not to be democratic . We 're all democratic , " she added . I wondered if she thought the Glenwood country club was democratic . We went riding happily home . Home was Shongalo . <p> " Somebody was here this afternoon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a husky boy , freckled and friendly , home from his first year in college . A bath before dinner , strenuously urged upon him by his mother , had reddened the mosquito bites along his arms . The water had darkened and subdued his light hair . <p> Mrs. Stratton laughed . " Lots of people were here . " Her gaze on him was almost doting . Her children were her idols . Missing him through the school year had made her twice as fond . " The four of us , at least . " <p> " Do n't leave Miss Weldon out , " Mr. Stratton said kindly . <p> " Milly , please , " I said . <p> " All right . Milly . Is that for Mildred ? " <p> " Yes , but I like it better . I never liked Mildred . " <p> " I 'm telling you there was this car here . " Bobby was getting cross at them , but I could imagine it happened quite a lot  --  they had a strange habit of talking past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Lots of cars , " his father teased . <p> " Aw ' ight , y'all do n't wan na listen . " Now he was mocking country speech , another trick . " What if I said it was a Jaguar " <p> That stopped them . Now they paid attention . " I was coming back from the creek . Down there fishing with R. C. I came up the bank by the tennis court and saw it drive off . I swear I did . " <p> " Well , " his mother said after a pause , " who was it " <p> " Do n't know . Just told you what I saw . " He shut up , sealed up tight , getting them back . He finished his plate . <p> Nothing was quite the same since he mentioned a Jaguar . " How did you know that 's what it was ? " Mr. Stratton pursued . <p> " Saw it . " <p> " I guess it 's all right to have a Jaguar , " Mrs. Stratton meditated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Came for Milly , " Mr. Stratton bantered . " Down in Stubbins they all drive around in ' em . Yes , sir . " <p> " In Stubbins they raise pickles , " I laughed . <p> " Lots of money in pickles , " Mr. Stratton said . " Maida , you must have seen it . You never go to sleep . " <p> " I was trying on bathing suits , " Maida said . " It was n't at the club , " she added . It would naturally be there . <p> " I bet it was Edward , " Mrs. Stratton suddenly said . <p> Mr. Stratton looked up sharply . Bobby and Maida stopped eating . Everyone but me knew who Edward was . <p> " Well , " Mrs. Stratton explained , " the time before it was a Mercedes , was n't it ? " <p> " He 'd borrowed that one from some friend , " Mr. Stratton said drily . " With friends like that , anything is possible . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not wanting to quarrel . <p> " Edward got some money out of that old place of theirs . Finally sold it , I understand . Maybe he just came to visit in his brand-new car . " <p> " But nobody really saw him , " Maida complained . " You do n't know it was him . " She sounded like what she was , a bright student arguing a firm point . <p> Mrs. Stratton smiled at her . " It just seems like it would have to be Edward . " <p> Mr. Stratton turned to me . " Edward , Miss Weldon  --  Milly , I mean  --  is a cousin of ours . He  --  well , how do we explain Edward ? " <p> " He does unexpected things , " Mrs. Stratton said . " Going off to Mexico , for instance . I was always fond of Edward , " she added , and looked a little wistfully , I thought , down at her wedge of icebox pie . <p> " He wants unexpected things , " Mr. Stratton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . " <p> " That you wo n't give him . " Mrs. Stratton almost flared . " No reason on earth not to . " <p> " None of his business . The Glenns sold it . George Glenn preferred not to hold on . So it 's finished . " <p> " You like refusing , " his wife returned . " Jeannie never meant the slightest harm . " Strange names were flying , tempers close behind . <p> " I like minding my own business . " <p> " It 's a simple request . You like defeating him . You wo n't admit it . " <p> " I want some more tea , " said Bobby . Mrs. Stratton rang the bell . <p> As for me , I said nothing . No more than Bobby did I know for sure that the man I 'd seen was Edward . I wanted to know and yet did n't want to speak of it . Yet did n't they have a right to find out that a stranger was in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never said . I went floating through the encounter once again , moment by moment <p> " It 's the funniest thing ! I ca n't help laughing out loud . It 's just most awfully funny . " Maida was reading Noel Coward , Hay Fever . <p> " You 're sounding British already , " I said . <p> " We could go there someday . " <p> " Go where ? " <p> " To England . " <p> " Maybe . " I had to be vague . I had got into her plans ; her future delights included me . <p> " I used to love reading , " Mrs. Stratton volunteered from across the room , putting aside the paper . " But you know when I met Robert and married ... well , it 's foolish to say so , but all the things I was reading for were all around me , right near instead of somewhere else . I mean I read about these girls who admired some man and then found he liked them too , and so finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of hitches and all that . But was n't there always a big estate in it somewhere ? A wonderful house and all that ? Well , all of a sudden had Shongalo . Why read about some place I might not even liked This one was good enough . " Her little laugh was young , a lot like Maida 's . " I saw lots of splendid old houses on a trip to England . You know , I would n't take any of them for this place right here . Did you know Maida started there ? " <p> " Oh , Mama , do n't tell that . " <p> " We rode somewhere I forget , a little bit out from the center of London , Robert and I. We were trying out the ' tube ' as they call it there . I looked up and saw this station that said ' Maida Vale . ' It sounded so pretty , I just could n't get over how pretty that did sound . So I said to Robert , ' If we ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Maida Vale . ' We just do n't use all of it , though I think double names are nice . They 're often very melodic , do n't you think so , Milly ? " <p> " Well , I do n't think much of Mildred Carrothers Weldon . " <p> " A family name . That 's different . They 're often awkward . Mine is double , too . Linda May . I always liked both , but to Robert I 'm just Linda  --  or Lin . Only then you 'd spell it different . " <p> " Differently , " Maida corrected . <p> " I 'm going to spank you , " Mrs. Stratton said without meaning it . <p> It was late on Saturday morning , nearly lunchtime . Among the rooms at Shongalo trivial conversations could spin on forever . They were like iced tea cold in tall glasses packed with ice cubes , pale with a moon-shaped slice of lemon . Outside , the heat almost audibly prickled on the lawn , baked hot the flagstone path to the sunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , and the blade fan turned slowly above , taking it up , passing it on . Maida ran out of the room  --  seeking bathroom or dictionary or following some whim about what to read next . <p> Mrs. Stratton put down the paper with a definite gesture . <p> " You ca n't know how pleased I am with this interest you 've stirred in Maida Vale . She 's always been so active . I get worried sometimes when she gets active in the wrong direction You can imagine . We joined tie club for her . Bobby too , of course . Robert and I could n't care less about all those meetings and club doings . He never golfs . But the children ... socially , I suppose ... " She trailed off . She was about to say , I think , that social affairs did n't interest her much . The lack of interest went with her inward air , her absence of any detailed care for clothes or looks . It made sense that she would be content in her place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek anything to fill her time . There were relatives they spoke of , not only the mysterious Edward , but others , some in the North , and others in Alabama who had " needed them " for a time , but now were " straightening up again . " I never inquired . I listened . <p> " Maida , " I began , but did not know how to follow up . <p> " Yes ? " said Mrs. Stratton . <p> " Maida may be getting too fond of me . " I felt awkward and blushed . <p> " Oh yes , I know what you mean . " Mrs. Stratton should have been sewing . Her speech went like that . She could have stopped from time to time to smooth out fabric , straighten thread , inspect her work , then continue . She smiled . " Things of that sort pass . Maybe it 's a phase . Can you stay ? " <p> " Stay ? " I was surprised . I had meant to leave the next morning . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on Monday . It 's some business over near Leland .

I said that I did n't . " Well , she 's just this wonderful person , an aunt of ours by marriage . She does n't have long , they tell us . " Here , I thought she should have been drawing a thread through an intricate turn . By " have long " she meant , I guessed , that the aunt was dying . " Leaving Maida Vale here just with Bobby . Just boylike , he wo n't pay her a bit of attention except when he feels like it . And besides , she 's just wild for you to stay . " <p> " Well , I  --  " <p> " Robert will speak to you . " At that she did their strange trick of turning into someone else . Laid aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a minute . I 've just got to see about  --  " The chatelaine . I had learned that word somewhere along the way . It suited her . Her reading now  --  romances from the sound of them , but maybe not the cheap kind . Magazines were her choice at present , probably . Or mysteries . TV had not caught such a firm hold here , scarcely into the ' 50s . Bobby was showing signs of interest . There was a set with rabbit ears , such as people had back then , in the upstairs hall . He would sit there in an old wicker armchair covered in faded cretonne , looking at the images . In those days before color hey often looked grayish , and the frames would jump around depending on the weather . " You 're going to ruin your eyes , " Mrs. Stratton would say , passing him an the way to her room . I could glimpse its spaciousness when she opened her door . Sparsely furnished with a large oval rug on the dark-stained , wideboarded floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On two sides , tall windows let in light that seemed to bring in the color blue , like the sky . <p> Robert did speak to me , as she had said . <p> " We want you to stay on a day or two , Milly , " he earnestly told me . <p> He had asked me out for a stroll just before dinner to see his new plan for a terrace with chairs and tables near the tennis court . " The children are always eating out here . No place to put things . " Was he asking my advice ? I thought it only a pretense , a preface to something important . But was it so important to stay with Maida He raised a hand , like someone warding off an interruption . " I 've no right to ask for your time . Only if you could . " <p> " I never dreamed it was so crucial . " I wanted to ask why . <p> " Oh , I would n't undertake to say crucial . Maida is at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at colleges .

Maida .... There ca n't be a better gift to the world , Milly , than a woman who just goes into life with all that wonderful wildness about her . Right now she 's just a sight to behold , all her reading this and thinking that . I confess none of it gets me worked up , not at my age . But she 's just plain head over heels about it . Your going off ... it would seem like leaving her high and dry . We 'd have a regular crybaby . No telling how we 'd manage . " <p> We were walking side by side in a vague semicircle around the empty tennis court . It was after the ritual nap , also after the trip to the pool , cut short because there was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual bath . <p> Mr. Stratton was not an imposing man . He might have been attractive , in a boyish way , when younger . He had discerning gray eyes , fair skin , and an open way of talking , his regard traveling all about you as he spoke . Evaluating , noting , though never staring exactly ... kindly , I supposed . He always seemed to know much more than he chose to say . His business in town , for instance . I knew he ran an insurance company and went in daily on its affairs . He kept " some few head of cattle , " as he once remarked , at Shongalo , though where they were escaped me , never having heard them so much as moo . He was glad to be through with row-farming , he had also once remarked . <p> He had asked me questions before , but always in company , had never spoken to me alone . Yet now we strolled together amiably , like old friends , possibly relatives . The feeling was of having known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was rapidly becoming more bald than any man would have liked . A pale , high forehead crowned him , made his eyes prominent . He was scarcely taller than I ; though not frail exactly , he was not rugged either . His regard was for his property . Wherever those cows were , they were being cared for . Careful , he picked up a fallen pecan branch , looked at it before he hurled it aside into some weeds in an untended part of the yard beyond us . Property included Maida ; he was looking after her . But she was more than that , of course , and he next let me know it . <p> " There was all that trouble last year . " <p> I turned in surprise . " What trouble " <p> " Some boy she got crazy about here . I say ' some boy . ' Let 's just say he was n't anybody who would do for her . We 'll leave it there . " <p> " Is he in school ? " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... gone . Well , not exactly gone . He has some sort of local job . " It had a dark ring to it , the way he said it , and I knew I was n't to learn any more from him . <p> As we walked back to the house , he talked about what kind of chairs and tables we might like best for the terrace . Saying " we " that way made me feel a little alarmed . He asked again if I would stay . Looking up at the house , mysterious in the westering light that slanted before us , I marveled at how weightless its presence before us seemed . I could suddenly not imagine being anywhere else . " I kissed a strange man in the library , " I almost said , almost adding , " I live here . " I had found in the thought a different meaning for that simple phrase , I live here . I turned it in my mind , just as in an exercise I had often had my students do . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay for a day or so longer . <p> " Good , " he answered , and having gained the front steps , he ran up them to the porch . In that motion I saw him become imposing . He had the air of the owner of Shongalo . He held the door for me . <p> Monday morning . <p> " They 've gone ! " Maida said , gloating , full of jumps and twirls , running to fetch me coffee , make me toast , find the special jar of peach preserves . <p> Sunday had passed in a jumble of decisions about church . I went to the service with Mrs. Stratton , and Maida , dressing in a topsy-turvy rush , trying to find some good shoes and a piece of something she called a hat , went with us at the last minute . She sat close beside me in the pew : we read the responses in unison . In the afternoon , a clutch of chattering people came and went-relatives , friends . Names went up around them like a flock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did decide on napping . I dreamed . <p> Then Sunday was gone , like a day misplaced . <p> " They 've gone ! " said Maida . <p> Bobby , sleeping late , was soon to be seen plodding downstairs , a firm hand on the banister . He passed squint-eyed into the kitchen . The cook was off also , let go for the day . Bobby soon came to the table with a plate of cold fried potatoes and some leftover apple pie . He poured coffee and picked his fork up with his fist . Boys were often like that , pretending to be workmen or cowboys out of a movie . Maida ignored him . Whenever someone else was with us , she was waiting for them to leave . Since the evening before we had been reading Tennyson aloud . <p> When I asked Bobby 's plans for the day , he said he meant to go off fishing with R. C. and Clayton , whoever they were , but that it looked like rain . " I 'll just go over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plainly said anyplace was better than here in the house with us . I asked him , teacher-fashion , if he 'd seen any more Jaguars . <p> " Naw . I know it was Edward though . " <p> " How d' you know that ? " Maida was a great one for probing . She always had her curiosity working , one thing that made her such a good student . " I mean , " she added , " nobody saw him . " <p> " I just think it was , " said Bobby , shoveling pie in his mouth . <p> " But who , " I asked , " is Edward " <p> There was a small silence , and Bobby said , " A cousin . " <p> I laughed . " You said that before . Is n't everybody your cousin ? " <p> Bobby was already heading out the door . Maida began to clear the table . She was thinking already of Idylls of the King . " He just comes and goes so funny , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to get to know without seeming to want to know ? <p> She came back from the kitchen for more of the breakfast things , but stopped to look out the window of the smaller dining room , where we sat . The family hardly ever breakfasted together . They , too , came and went . " It 's so pretty out there , " she remarked , seeing the morning yard with its rose garden , its birdbath , its shrubs . She all but clapped her hands . Bobby was gone . We had the place to ourselves . " I want to always live at Shongalo ! " <p> " I ca n't say I blame you . " <p> " Do n't you love it " <p> " I love it , " I said , sincere as ever I could be . " Can I come and go , " I ventured , " like this Edward person ? " <p> Maida whirled on me , jumping forward in a little rabbitlike spring , throwing slightly sticky arms around my neck . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read ! Everything there is ! I 'll know as much as you ! " <p> " Lots more , I hope . " <p> " Promise " <p> " Promise what ? " <p> " You 'll never leave . " <p> " I promise we 'll find our book wherever we left it yesterday . " <p> " You wo n't promise ? " <p> " Now Maida . I 'll come and go , whenever you let me . Soon you 'll be saying I come and go ' funny , ' like Edward . " <p> She sat down ; her bouncing fit was passing . " But Edward just comes without telling anybody . He just shows up . Daddy says he thinks he belongs here . " <p> " What do you think of that " <p> " Just that you would n't . I do n't guess you would . Mother likes to see him , though . He makes Daddy mad . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Oh ... he thinks she likes him . " <p> " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he calls me a brat . And I 'm not . Am I ! " The question was a tease , but before I could answer she was off at a run , leaving the breakfast things to me . <p> A brat .... Yes , he did say that . <p> Gently , the rain had started . <p> All that long day while the rain plunged us both into our separate dreams , we read in the library , in the family room , in the formal living room at the round inlaid table beneath the chandelier . Curious as Maida , but for different reasons , I pulled a drawer a little way out . " Look , " I noted . " The table 's like a pie . " Indeed it was ; the five drawers with bronze pulls were triangular , ending in a point at center . Maida hardly noticed . In one brief glimpse I had seen that the drawer was empty . Bad manners were what I could not afford to let her notice my having . Were the other drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sir Gawain 's vision . The rain continued . <p> It had n't started in the usual rush of wind and flash-bang of thunder , but only as a rustle , muted as a whisper , then growing louder . It seemed to have put out gray arms and enveloped the day . The interiors of Shongalo were shadowy , dim . At night we might have found strong light in corners , not the cloudy mist that had permeated every room , drunk up the lamplight and left us sometimes unable to make out the words on the page . In the corner of a sofa , Maida leaned against my shoulder as I read . We were about to go on to Mordred 's betrayal of Lancelot and Guinevere to Arthur . I finished a long descriptive passage . <p> " You know , " Maida remarked , " it 's pretty , but it makes me sleepy . " <p> " Later on , " I promised , " it will make you cry . " <p> " Let 's skip to that , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : why do people like to read what makes them cry " Emotions get to show themselves , " I explained . " You can sympathize and cry over people you never met , so it does your own feelings good . " She puzzled over it , and really it was n't a very good answer . Why do teachers think they have to answer things that students ask ? <p> One thing I was glad about : the rain made it impossible to go in and swim . Maida was always taking chances , diving , chasing somebody underwater . She had some of the boys there daring her . One of them called her at times . He asked her to go with him to a picnic or the movies . She would tell him that Miss Weldon was still here , though to her I 'd long since become just Milly . " Go on if you want to see him . " " Maybe I do n't , " was all she 'd say . She 'd let it out that a boy she 'd liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . " You do n't want to see him " She was vague in replying . So that must have been the one her father spoke of . One day , leaving the pool , I had seen him too . He was lingering near the entrance , a tall , rather swart boy with thick hair of a color that habitually looked dirty , a serious face half turned away . Maida had given a little wave , and he had nodded . " That 's Garth , " she told me . " Who ? " " You know ... the one they did n't like . " <p> The rain was shifting around , blowing softly in through an open window . Maida jumped up to close it . " I know . Let 's go upstairs . There 's a good lamp in the little room . You have n't seen the little room , I bet . " She was running already , up the stairs . I followed . <p> The door to the " little room " was between the one opening on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , that was Bobby 's . No telling what was behind that one , though I could imagine pennants and posters , a jumble of everything and nothing . In the little room there was a jumble , too . <p> Sewing ! Not for nothing had I connected Mrs. Stratton with that . She had obviously put everything pertaining to it here . There stood her dress form , armless , chastely plastered over with brown paper , though her own lines were visible , low-set and full-fleshed , a friendly shape . An old quilt was folded , lying on top of a large oval basket woven from broad withes . Mending must be inside . Both a hanging lamp and a standing one were fitted with strong bulbs . Maida had switched them on already . The one window looked down to the lawn far below and the path that led to the sunken garden . " Now .... " A sofa bed against he wall was waiting for us to sit and read more . But though she sat down as though waiting for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . She just sat holding it , frowning and thinking very hard of something . The rain stood at the window , a gray presence , but here it was full of secluded light . An armchair too big for the small space was opposite . When I sat in it , our knees were almost touching . " Are you tired of reading ? " I asked . She did n't answer . <p> Maida Vale had a charming face , mainly , I had often thought , because it was so changeable . Serious , she might almost seem to sulk ; her thoughts were inward , running over something that puzzled , maybe even offended her . She had chubby cheeks when she smiled , lighting up at something from the outside world , small teeth , bursts of crinkles , upturning lips when she laughed , her eyes half-shut with all-out fun . A boy might want to kiss her a lot , I thought . I felt she wanted to confide something in me , so was waiting ; but then the telephone rang . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not especially wanting to go , finally went out to the extension near the TV in the upper hall . She came back distractedly . <p> " It 's for you . " <p> " For me " <p> My mother , of course , knew where I was . I had called to tell her that I would stay longer , but why would she call me now ? Sickness , maybe , or an accident . <p> Of course , there was Willie . <p> I had kept Willie under wraps because there was nothing much to say about him , the necessary escort in the small town , the one you went to the movies with , asked to parties , gave routine good-night kisses to . There 'd been others before him , one at college I 'd rather not think about , but others , too , here and there , no more than average . Willie would hardly call . <p> " Hello , " the voice said in answer to mine . Then I knew . " Still there ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've thought of you . But ... what 's your name  --  ? " <p> " My name ? " <p> " Yes , your name . I did n't get it . " <p> " Mildred ... I mean , Milly .... What 's yours ? " <p> " Ca n't hear . " There was a sputtering on the line , then a crackle . " Ca n't hear you , " he said again . <p> " Who are you ? " I all but shouted . Some word began to form , but the sound mangled and the line went dead . <p> I returned slowly . <p> " Who was it ? " Maida asked me . <p> " I do n't know . The wrong number I suppose . " <p> " But you said your name . " <p> " It 's how he knew it was wrong , I guess . " <p> She gave me the kind of look that comes out of knowing a friend has told a lie . Her mouth was slightly open ; a thinking went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It 's what he said . " <p> " I guess women stay everywhere , " I said lightly . I picked up Idylls of the King . " I lost the place , " I said , searching . <p> But Maida was not listening . She was staring at me , her mood so altered that mentioning the book seemed totally irrelevant . " Did you ever fall in love ? " she suddenly inquired . <p> " Everybody does , " I said , " sooner or later . " <p> " I was in love last year . It was Garth . They said it would n't do , " <p> " Who said so ? " <p> " Mother did , and Daddy . Daddy was the worst . " <p> " They think of you , " I said firmly . I could n't be ganging up against them . Nor did I want to deny her confidence . It was dangerous ground . <p> " It was when his mother came . She came here and wanted to talk to Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her lap , lifting and shaking it . " Mother said it was awful . " <p> " You mean his mother was awful ? Then you saw what they meant  --  your parents , I mean . " <p> " I do n't know if I saw what hey meant . I just do n't know . It was all such a big lot of talking all of a sudden . " She hit the cushion . " I just hated everything . " <p> I smiled . " It 's all behind you , is n't it ? Back there last year somewhere ? " At her age a year was a long time . <p> " I do n't know , " she said , still thinking ; " I guess . " <p> I had found the place in Idylls of the King . <p> " Do you think sex is bad ? Making love , I mean . Is that so bad ? " <p> " Well , no , but I think you ought to get older before you decide about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was determined to read on from where we had stopped . Not a doubt that she was n't listening , but like someone walking ahead on a path I hoped she 'd follow . <p> " Somebody wanted you , " Maida insisted . " They wanted to talk to you . " <p> " Why do n't you read for a change " I held out the book . <p> She stared a moment , then got up and ran from the room , stumbling over the large basket , which tilted open , spilling its contents . Between friends , what lie will ever do ? The answer is : None . <p> I knew that I did n't care quite enough what Maida thought . I knew that . I sat with my heart beating like a drum . He had remembered me . He had called . " What 's your name ? " It kept chanting . I could even hear again the snarled static on the phone . Rumbling thunder shook the house softly , like a dog worrying a worn-out toy . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far off at the entrance . The Strattons had returned . <p> As the car drew up , stopping near the front , I wondered where Maida had gone . I searched , intending , I suppose , to take her hands , to say I was sorry for whatever had upset her . But I did n't find her . She would reappear . Open and frank always , she would tell me what was wrong . We would find another book , a different sort , snappy satire or hard-surfaced mystery . Things would resume as before . <p> From an upstairs window I saw the sky clearing , long , broken clouds turning to pink scarves , light gleaming on the wet trees . There was evening still left , and part of the late afternoon . Shoes were crunching the gravel , tapping up the wooden steps . " Maida ! Bobby ! Milly ! We 're home ! " <p> I dressed for dinner with more care than usual . I brushed my hair till it shone , a mix of blond and brown , sun-streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brown clasp like tortoiseshell . I put on a full , flowered skirt I had not worn before , and a blouse in ivory cotton latticed with embroidery , cut low . In my Stubbins vision of what might happen at Shongalo , I had prepared for a possible party , a dance at the country club , who knew what ? But these were not to be , and so far I had not dared to appear in such a getup . But now I did n't care . <p> Where was Maida ? The heavy steps I heard battering up and down the stairs were Bobby 's . First he was explaining something , then his father called him back ; he was quarreling with his mother ; from the sound of water pouring out he was taking a shower ; he was hollering from the door that he could n't hear what they were saying . He was much too big for the house , for any house . Something fell and crashed in his room . He was mad . He was furious . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from below , he was dressed in slacks and a fresh shirt and smiled with calm beatitude when we encountered each other at the top of the stairs . <p> At dinner no one even mentioned the trip to Leland , or the aunt Maggie Lee . Robert Stratton , responding to my dressed-up state , drew my chair out for me . He waited a moment to start serving the plates , as Maida was not present but could be heard descending the stairs . She came in quietly and sat with her head tucked , her face quiet and pale , not looking my way . " Are you all right , honey ? " asked her mother . She said that she was . <p> " We drove through some awful weather , " Robert Stratton said . " Coming back between here and Leland . The worst was over when we arrived . " <p> " A whole roof blown off and some trees down . The house was dark when we came . Did n't you all have sense enough to turn the lights on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was like that other time we lost power , " Mr. Stratton recalled . " Candlelight and lamps , I thought . " <p> " It was pretty , " said Mrs. Stratton . " But everything got cold . " <p> " We got no old range anymore to build a fire with stove wood . I well remember that other time . I went out back and found that son of Annie 's . Or was it Delia 's ? " <p> " No sir , it was Annie , " Delia said from the kitchen . <p> " I said , ' Can you bring us in some stove wood ? ' He had just got home from Chicago for a visit . He did n't know what stove wood was . What happened to that old range , Lin ? " <p> " Gave it away . One of Annie 's daughters wanted it . " <p> " Now she 's got electricity too . Time marches on . " <p> " Speaking of time , " I said , " I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maida looked up , startled . They were all silent . <p> " Oh ? Make it the day after . " Robert Stratton put it that way , for reasons he knew best . He did n't say , Stay on and on . He did n't say , What could we do without you ? I found out why the next evening , when we talked in the sunken garden , out near the lily pool . <p> We sat on the stone bench . It had grown warm again that day , though the freshness from the rain had lingered . <p> " Maida is n't so taken up , " he remarked . I had go to know his train of thought . His conversation up to then had seemed to absorb him : changes in the Delta , more to come , things his little trip had brought to mind . But this was his real subject , now appearing . <p> " ' Taken up ? ' " I repeated . I could already guess what he mean . <p> " All this reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " <p> " So you thought it was a bad thing ? " I saw that , unconsciously , I had used the past tense . Maida and I had talked , but had not mentioned a book all day long . We had talked about movies , one we had missed in town . Some friends of Bobby 's had showed up , and she had wanted to go out to play tennis with them . I had to join , she insisted , so as to have another girl . <p> " I think , " said Robert Stratton , and crossed his ankle over his knee , " that anything done to exclusion is not such a good thing . " He glanced at me through late , lingering light . " Do n't you agree ? " <p> " I never thought it was forever , " I said . " It 's been such fun  --  her enthusiasm , I mean . To think I stirred it up . I love books , too , you know . " I thought I should point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't forget . Nor will we . " He leaned against me , pressed my knee , took my hand . He was a great one for patting . " We 'll always thank you , Milly . " And time , as he had so lightly mentioned it at table , had not marched ; it had jumped right out at us . <p> I saw how neatly he had taken everything away from me . I wanted to protest . But I knew whatever I said to him would leave me biting my lip , feeling it was wrong at that moment , just as in the future I would feel it , looking back . <p> I said something anyhow . " Thank me for what ? What is it you think I did ? " <p> " Oh , I expect you see that , or will if you do n't now . She had to live through it , you see . So one day ... why , you 'll see . " <p> Angry ! But how , if I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I murmured something about having to pack and walked inside . My planned speech  --  how wonderful it had been at Shongalo , getting to know them , make friends , plan a return visit .... What was the use of going through a useless exchange ? I left Robert Stratton sitting meditatively , smoking a pipe , which he would presently knock but against the stone bench before going inside . It was another ritual , a habit he had . <p> Mrs. Stratton heard me come in and called from the living room . Would I have coffee ? I pled a headache . I went trembling up the stairs . Was n't it part of my perception of them that they were different from the ordinary run of people ? Not to be easily , if ever , completely seen into ? But I 'd been used ! It was that that hurt , more than if they 'd coarsely scorned me at the beginning , or given me a caretaker 's shedroom at the back . <p> I looked around the room , at the muted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark-stained floorboards , its rugs a little worn , a little sun-stained . My things were all around , more confident than I. I drew my suitcase from the big closet and set it open on the bed . That headache was no lie . I took two aspirin and lay down beside the open case . I fell asleep . <p> When I woke I wondered what time it was . Everything was quiet . I found my watch  --  two o'clock . Tiptoeing to the broad hall outside , I knew I had gained control again . I would have this place , in memory at least , from now on . I moved to the front of the central upper hall , where the broad , curved windows looked down on the lawns below . I could see the path to the sunken garden and part of the garden itself , not the pool , but an urn and the one small statue , clearly visible in the moonlight . <p> Someone was out there . A shadow moved , going toward the line of shrubs between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tall man walking slowly , hands thrust in pockets . It was not Robert Stratton . <p> I knew who it was . <p> I floated downward , drawn through the silence of thinking about it . I found no obstacle , not a creaking floorboard or a resistant door . The path to the garden was plain ; I turned the corner by the hedge . There lay the pool , smooth as carbon paper . The grass had been mowed that day , and the fresh smell lingered . I had noticed it earlier mingling with the scent of Robert Stratton 's whiskey . No one was about . I circled outward , moving toward the heavy line of trees , dense in their dew-wet mystery . I went to them and peered into the wood . The insects had stopped chanting , but I heard no footstep , no breath or rustle . I saw no one . Nothing . I returned to the house . On the path , the old dog snuffled up beside me . He put a damp nose in my palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the porch he went to his accustomed corner and lay down . He as not allowed inside . <p> All that was forty years ago . <p> For years I received a Christmas message from the Strattons , a card with a letter enclosed , telling me about Bobby and Maida , also about themselves and what had gone on at Shongalo during the year . The children went off to school , had various mishaps and triumphs . Bobby barely missed having to go to Vietnam . After finishing school and college at Duke , Maida almost moved to New York to work . Instead , she married a Charleston boy , a young doctor . Maida wrote me , too , for a time , but the correspondence faded into postcards and finally vanished . I sent a wedding present . <p> Before I left , I took something . I went into the little room to find the book we had been reading . It was lying facedown where we 'd left it . The woven basket had turned over with Maida 's rush from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packet of letters . They had been held together with a rubber band , but it had broken . I saw at once , among all the others , a long envelope , faded yellow , with " Edward Glenn " written across it in black ink in an old-fashioned , flowing hand . There was no address , just the name , so it was meant to be given by hand . It was by instinct that I picked it up , without thought . Perhaps what I had in mind was a sort of revenge . <p> Once away , I opened it , but found nothing surprising . A wish from an elderly man , some aging relative , that " my boy , " the young Edward , would have a profitable time at school , and would make the family proud , as they had always been of him heretofore . It was handsomely stated , with feeling as real as heartbeats . It was such as this he felt worth returning to search for in the crevices of Shongalo . And Linda Stratton thought worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and would tell him " This is yours , " if the chance came my way . <p>
