The rest of us have just seen greatness . These dozen men have felt it . The rest of us , even most teammates and friends , have been forced to follow the wonders of Joe Montana from a distance . These dozen men have been close enough to hear them . He has breathed down their shoulder pads . Screamed through their ear holes . Leaned exhaustedly on their hip pads . Dripped blood on their backs . They have caught none of his touchdown passes . They have received none of his handoffs . They did n't play starring roles in The Catch , or The Drive , or the many-sequeled Comeback Kid . But before Joe Montana has started anything , it has started with them . Brian Phillips . Joe Debranski . Mark Gorscak . Vince Klees . Steve Quehl . Dave Huffman . Fred Quillan . Randy Cross . Chuck Thomas . Walt Downing . Jesse Sapolu . Tim Grunhard . Meet Joe 's centers . From the Monongahela ( Pa . ) Wildcats to the Kansas City Chiefs , they have etched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the ones to give its greatest quarterback the ball . Now that Montana 's career has ended , they have looked back to discover what they shared was far more than pigskin . With Montana they have laughed , celebrated , hurt , fought and experienced a relationship far deeper than the word " Hut . " In celebration of Montana 's announced retirement this week , they agreed to share some of these tales . After , of course , they were tracked down . Discovery occurred in small towns and big cities from the Boston area to San Francisco . One former 49ers center was even found living 20 minutes from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton , O. " Tell Joe I 'm waiting for him , " former 49er Walt Downing says . They are cement mixers and stockbrokers and TV analysts . In yet another tribute to the endurance of Montana , 38 , only one of the dozen is still playing center and two are still playing football . Besides all being literally touched by legend , they have another thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody wants to know what it was like to have Joe Montana 's hands all over your butt , " former Notre Dame center Steve Quehl says . Everybody ? He paused . " Mostly the girls , " he says . The career of Joe Montana , from a different perspective ... THE EARLY YEARS Brian Phillips , 38 , owner of Brian Phillips Cement Contracting , Monongahela , Pa . I guess I was his first center , huh ? Midget league and junior high . I ca n't believe somebody remembered . I do n't even know if Joe remembers . People in this town do n't think he remembers any of us . He never comes back and has n't really left anything behind . So he probably does n't remember me either . That 's OK . I understand . I sure remember him . I remember him for a Blue Chevy Caprice . That 's the car his dad drove us around in , about eight or nine of us kids . He drove us all over the Pittsburgh area to play basketball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back then , it was obvious his dad was a big reason for Joe 's success . His dad would get involved in everything Joe did , go to the practices , the games , all that stuff . His dad sometimes acted like everybody 's dad . Another reason for Joe 's success was those drives in that Caprice . Because we would go into other neighborhoods , sometimes tough , inner-city neighborhoods and play kids in basketball . And we would win . Just storm them . That made us tough . Gosh , Joe was a great basketball player . Better than football , if you ask me . I 've seen him play one-on-one , spot some guy eight points , and beat him , 10-8 . Beat him with his left hand . Unbelievable leaping ability . I 'm serious . He could fly . He was also a heck of a punter . Just a great athlete . And a good wide receiver . Once in high school , Ringgold ( of Monongahela ) played Brownsville . I lined up in the slot , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball to me . By that time , Joe was running down the left sideline . I threw him a pass . He caught it . Touchdown . Believe it or not . Has he ever caught a touchdown pass since ? I do n't think so . I guess maybe that puts us in history together . Also maybe I 'm the only center who leaned over a ball one time and noticed that he was not behind me like he was supposed to be . He had lined up over guard . " Hey Joe , " I yelled . " Wrong ass . " You did n't want to mess too badly with Joe , though . He may be a great practical joker these days , but I was there when it started . We 're lying on mats in a school hallway outside the high school cafeteria , resting during three-a-day practices one summer . All of us are eating fruit . You know . Dates , apples , pears . Well , our big tackle , Tank Tabarella , threw an apple core at Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and fired an apple core back at Tank . Well , Tank ducked and the core flew into the cafeteria and hit one of the workers . Bit her good . Gave her a hurting . But Joe fell back down so fast , she never knew where it came from . People talk about that bullet he threw to Dwight Clark in that championship game as being his best pass ever . I know better . Joe Debranski , 39 , track department foreman , Contail , Pittsburgh When I think about Joe , I think about his hands . It was only at Ringgold High , but they were the softest , smoothest hands of any quarterback who had ever lined up underneath me . This was also a problem . Because I could never tell when Joe did n't have his hands there . There was nothing to stop him from playing a practical joke by pulling his hands out at the last minute and watching me snap the ball into my crotch . He thought that was funny . Ha-ha . All of us forgave Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoother on the field . I was there on that Friday against Monessen . The game that made Joe Montana . Big rivalry between a couple of steel towns . They were a powerhouse . Supposed to whip us . Nice time for Joe 's first game as a starter . We walked on to the field before the game and I could n't believe it . Our team was in total silence . Nobody said a word . It was so quiet , nobody even said , " Do n't say anything . " We thought , " So this is how Montana leads his team before a game . " The intensity was incredible . And what happens ? What do you think ? Joe throws three touchdown passes , takes us to a 21-7 lead at the end of the first half , and we hang on for a 34-all tie . That game was so good , I wish I could get the film and send it to you . Apparently the coach sent it to Notre Dame , because some say that the Monessen game is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town still talk about that game . The guys at work , they are always hassling me , saying , " Hey man , you played with Montana , you and Joe are tight . " I say , " Right , man , he is sending me some tickets for this weekend 's games , I should get them in the mail tomorrow . " But they know , and I know , that I am joking . Because I have only seen Montana in person once since high school . He was back in town for some ceremony that honored him . I wanted to talk to him , kick around old times , did I ever . But you know , it was tough even getting close to him . Best I could do was , I got his attention and he nodded at me . That was it . But , hey , that was enough . He knew who I was . That nod was for me . Mark Gorscak , 38 , football administration coordinator , Weber State , Ogden , Utah I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being from Utah , introduced Steve Young as the greatest quarterback ever . I told everybody at my table , " I can dispute that . " I only regularly centered for Joe during his senior year at Ringgold High , but even then , I could tell how cool he was . It was his hands . He would always slide them underneath me late . Like , right before the snap . Never worried that he might miss the ball . Just went up there and grabbed it and that was it . Another thing I remember about Joe was his eyes . When he wanted to get something done , he would give us this look in the huddle . We just knew he was going to do it . I went to the Ringgold campus in Donora while Joe went to the campus in Monongahela , so I never really saw him off the field except during summer workouts . And during that time , I probably saw him more on the basketball court . Did anybody tell you that Joe was a great basketball player ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? In my office here in Utah , I have an autographed picture of Joe . It kind of stands out here in Steve Young country . I i tell people , " I was the man who made Joe famous . ' ' " But I 'm just joking . I tried to go see Joe during a pre-season scrimmage a couple of years ago and could n't even get near him because of security . But who knows ? He may not remember me . He may not remember any of his centers . THE BLUE AND GOLDEN YEARS Vince Klees , 39 , Stockbroker , A.G. Edwards and Sons Inc. , Hanover Park , Ill . Everybody talks so much about Joe Montana being a small-town boy , it has almost become cliche . But I remember when it was true . He came to Notre Dame as a freshman from Monongahela with good looks , an All-American smile and a ton of ability . He could have dated any woman on campus . But you know what ? All he talked about was wanting to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe and I mostly stood on the sideline together those early Notre Dame years . So we spent a lot of time talking to each other . And sure enough , he was just a sweet small-town kid who could n't stop talking about his wedding . Which we could n't believe . We would gather around him at night and tell him , " C'm on , man , you 're Joe Montana , you look good , you can have anything you want here , forget about marriage ! " But he would n't . He could n't . By the next year , he was married . My future wife was friends with his first wife , and a couple of times , my wife would babysit for their dog . I forget what kind of dog it was , but I do remember its name . Pupper . I remember thinking , what a ridiculous name for a dog . It was so corny . So small-town . But it was perfect . The only thing that was n't quaint about Joe was his ability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could see it every day . Not on the practice field , because Dan Devine ( who coached Montana after his freshman season ) would n't let him show much . I 'm talking about the basketball court . I 'll never forget playing intramurals once and looking up and seeing a kid hanging above the rim , waiting for the ball like Michael Jordan or something . Believe it or not , that was Joe . You 'll have to ask Devine how much he was n't allowed to show that ability until nearly his senior year . You 'll have to ask Devine why the man who became one of the greatest quarterbacks ever sat on the bench . To this day , some of us are still wondering . Steve Quehl , 42 , senior vice president of Software Division , Wang Laboratories , Lowell , Mass . A little story about Joe and a costume party . It was held at Ara Parseghian 's house because it involved Ara 's daughter . A nice pace . All upperclassmen . A big deal . And here comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dressed ? Like a bunny rabbit . Seriously . A bunny . We looked at him and thought , that fits this guy exactly . All innocent . All small-town . We learned later that year , in games against North Carolina and Air Force , that looks were deceiving . In my opinion , it was in those two games in 1975 that the Montana legacy started . Joe did n't play as a freshman ( freshmen were ineligible then ) and was buried on the bench as a sophomore . But we got ourselves in trouble in Chapel Hill against North Carolina that year ( down 14-6 with 6:04 to play ) , and Joe was brought in . We looked at each other like , " What do we have to lose ? " We did n't know anything about this guy . Well , we found out . In those final minutes he literally won the game with his arm ( Montana threw two touchdown passes , including an 80-yard game winner to Ted Burgmeier to lead Notre Dame to a 21-14 victory ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such heat . I 'm suffering heat prostration , stripping down between series to take ice baths on the sideline , and Joe is unbelievably cool . Later that year , we are playing at Air Force , in a game we always win , but we are n't winning . They get ahead and stay ahead . Nothing we could do . And then Joe came in . He was n't a great practice player , maybe that 's why he did n't play more early in his career . But by then , we knew what he could do under pressure . He could step up , read a defense and put the ball where it needs to be . Man , you ca n't practice that . So he walked into that huddle in Colorado Springs ( Notre Dame trailing , 30-10 , with 13 minutes remaining ) . We looked around at each other and said , " Hey , here 's our shot . " By then , he was instant credibility . Sure enough , he pulled it out for us ( Montana led Notre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was incredible . He was passing , running ... and finally earned everybody a game ball . To this day , that is one of only two game balls that I own . The other one is from the infamous Rudy game against Georgia Tech at the end of Joe 's sophomore season . That was the game they immortalized in the movie , where ( walk-on ) Rudy ( Ruettiger ) got to play and was carried off the field by a couple of guys and all that . Yeah , I have the ball from that game . The only ball . I do n't think Rudy knows it . And I do n't think I want him to know it . Dave Huffman , 38 , manager of Lifetouch Photography , Minneapolis What are you talking to me for ? I centered for Joe for three years at Notre Dame but never saw one thing he did . I was pointed in the other direction , remember ? I can tell you this . In three years we did not have one fumbled snap . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late every day after practice during our sophomore year and practiced that snap . That 's how intense he was . After a while , he was like , " Give it to me and get out of the way . " And so I did . Ah , some of the things I saw ... Everybody has their own favorite Montana game . Mine was against Purdue in Joe 's junior year . The last game he did n't start . If you ask me , that is when the real Montana legacy started . Our other quarterbacks blew up in one game , and suddenly we needed Montana ( Notre Dame trailed , 21-14 , with 11 minutes to go ) . And there he was . Came in and took us down the field and saved us ... again ( Montana threw two touchdown passes in a 31-24 victory ) . What he would do was kneel down in the middle of the huddle , lick his fingers and say , " OK , let 's win this game . " And that 's what would happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to block that guy . " He was so intense , you would look back and say , " OK , OK , OK . " Not that he was always that intense . I 'm sure you 've heard the stories . He was always stealing somebody 's jockstrap , stuff like that . Once he even walked up to the line and stuck his hands under Teddy Horansky , one of our guards . As a joke . Teddy jumped about five feet . One time I got Joe back , or so I thought . I cut out a hole in my football pants so that when he stepped up behind me and put his hands up there , all he felt was skin . He went , " Whoooa . " Next thing I know , he drops back to pass and drills me in the back of the head . The good thing about Joe is , he never forgets you . When he as being courted by the Vikings a couple of years ago , back when I was still their center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know just three things about Minnesota . It 's cold , you play in a dome and one of your players is my idiot friend . " Touching , huh ? Oh , and about his last Notre Dame game . You know , the famous Cotton Bowl ( after the 1978 season , when Montana led Notre Dame to 35-34 victory over Houston after trailing 34-12 ) . I know everybody talks about Joe drinking chicken soup in the locker room at halftime because he was so cold and sick . Well , it was n't soup . It was some cheap broth . Some instant stuff you mix in a cup . I do n't know how Joe came out in the second half and did what he did . But I know that by then , we were n't surprised . THE GLORY YEARS Fred Quillan , 39 , offensive line coach for Scotland in the World League I centered for Joe from his rookie season with the 49ers in 1979 until I retired after the 1987 season . We won two Super Bowls during that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tell you about the gas . Joe was always playing tricks on me . Filling up envelopes with shaving cream and sticking them halfway under the door , then stepping on them . Stuff like that . If he really got me mad , I would make sure I would eat tacos or burritos before practice . That way , by the time practice started , I would be , uh , gassy . I 'm not making this up . So one time I was furious with him , and I ate all morning and early afternoon , and during practice it was really bad . Joe would step underneath me to take the snap and I would , uh , well , you know ... I did it so much that day , got it smelling so bad , that Joe finally stepped away from me , stopped practice and shouted , " I can not play with this guy ! I will not take another snap . " Bill Walsh was over there watching it and could n't believe it . This was during that 1984 season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and practice has stopped because one of the guys was , uh , breaking wind ? Joe starts yelling , I yell back , and Bill just throws up his hands and walks away . Actually , Joe was a center 's best friend . If there was ever a bad snap , Joe took the fall . Every time . One time in practice , we messed up a snap , Walsh was irate , and Joe immediately took the blame . But it was clearly my fault , so I told Walsh that . Joe snapped back that it was his fault , and I yelled back that it was my fault , and here we were arguing again . Walsh could n't figure it out , and threw up his hands again and walked away . After practice , Joe comes up to me and says , " Fred , do n't you ever do that again . You keep your mouth shut and I 'll take the blame . Always . " " Why ? " I asked . " Because , Fred , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always get yelled at more than me . If I take the blame , they wo n't yell so much . " Is that class or what ? I remember the worst call of my life was when I told a reporter that Steve DeBerg was better prepared to be our quarterback . Because Joe was so quiet , we just did n't know about his leadership . Midway through his second season , he proved it . He came into the huddle and it was like a different team . He inspired such respect in us and , more important , trust . That 's why one of the low points of my career was missing my guy in New York during the ' ' 86 playoffs and watching Jim Burt knock Joe out of the game . Joe stayed in New York with a concussion that night , while I went crazy on the airplane home . I wanted jump off the plane . I wanted to get home and jump off a bridge . It was n't all my fault because a lot of things happened on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , Joe never said a word to me about it . It was like he would never stop taking up for his linemen , no matter what . Some people say he is just a great quarterback . I know him as much more . Chuck Thomas , 34 , promotions and marketing , Rebound Sports , Inc. , youth camps , Houston I guess I 'm the answer to a trivia question . Who was Joe Montana 's center in the two games after Montana crossed the union picket line ? Joe 's replacement center . That was me . In 1987 . The final two replacement games . Most people forget that Joe crossed the line . Although maybe some union people remember . Anyway , I do n't think Joe was thumbing his nose at anybody , I think he just anticipated the end of the strike and came on in with a bunch of other guys . Am I glad he did . At the time , I had been with the 49ers in training camp , hurt my hamstring , then came back when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly a backup until I left the team after the 1992 season . But for three games I was the starter , and Joe was my quarterback in two of them . I 'll never forget it . In fact , I 'm looking at a game ball from the last game right now . It was against St. Louis . And the Cardinals were going hard after Joe . They had a heck of a blitz package coming in , throwing everything at him but the kitchen sink . But we hung in there . We protected him . The jewel was n't damaged . We won . It was great . He did n't say much after that game . But a couple of years later , while I was still on the team as a backup , there was something he did I will never forget . In the playoffs after the 1989 season , ( tackle ) Bubba Paris had an agreement with Joe . If our line kept him from getting sacked in the postseason , he would buy us a gift . They shook on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bounds  --  which does n't really count  --  he was never sacked during the postseason . The capper was , our year ended with our Super Bowl victory over the Broncos . I did n't think anything of their agreement until I came to minicamp in 1990 . There , sitting in my locker was a Rolex watch . On the back were these words , " To Chuck , With Much Appreciation , Super Bowl XXIV , Joe Montana . " I could n't believe it . I was a backup . I had been a replacement player . I had worked hard and contributed a lot but , still ... you can imagine how I felt . I walked over to him and said , " Joe , I really , really appreciate this . " He looked at me all embarrassed . I guess for him , I overreacted . He just said , " Good work . " And that was it . I have two Super Bowl rings . I have that painted game ball from St. Louis . But this Rolex watch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vice president of Green Lines Transportation , Inc. , trucking company , Malvern , O. I was a center with the 49ers from 1978 to 1983 . Backed up a lot of offensive linemen . Started a few games for Fred Quillan . But Joe and I were close for a number of reasons . Like , our birthdays were the same date . Not just day , but date . Both of us were born on June 11 , 1956 . Both born in Pennsylvania , me outside Philadelphia and Joe , of course , outside Pittsburgh . By sharing a birthday with Joe , I used to have fun at a lot of parties . I remember once we were doing a celebrity thing down in Santa Cruz , they gave us this cake when they found out it was both of our birthdays . So we decided to try to hit each other in the face with this cake . I do n't remember the exact results of the fight , but I remember that I at least got a little spot of cream on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big , it 's hard to miss . Those were the days . Teams were like family back then . We 'd all go have dinner after the game , just sit around afterward and talk , that 's what Joe loved to do . He was really shy at first . He could have done a ton more commercials back then , but that 's not want he wanted . Sometimes when we were going out , Joe did n't even want to drive his Ferrari . So I drove it for him . Now I 'm 6-foot-4 , about 275 pounds , so you can imagine how I looked . Ever seen somebody big trying to drive those Malibu Fun Center race cars ? That was me . But Joe was comfortable . He was happy . He really felt good around his offensive linemen . I remember once when Ed ( Too Tall ) Jones of Dallas was just about ready to hammer him . Joe stepped around him and threw about a 45-yard bullet to Dwight Clark . Joe jumped up and said something to Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of us to hide behind . That 's the way he was . But that was just fine with us . He took such good care of us , it was the least we could do for him . Randy Cross , 40 , NFL analyst , NBC Sports I know you 've probably heard this story a lot , but I want to let you know that it is the absolute , gospel truth . The John Candy story . I know it happened because I was there and heard every word of it . It was in the Super Bowl after the 1988 season , against the Bengals . We 're deep in our territory late in the game . We 're trailing . We need a big drive for the win . Joe steps into the huddle , stops , looks over on the sideline and says , " Hey , is n't that John Candy over there ? " Gospel truth . He was doing that sort of thing all the time . And a lot of it was absolutely intentional . He was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , everybody knows how he followed up that John Candy line with one of the greatest drives ever to give us the win . And he really was relaxed . That was real . The one thing that set him apart from many other quarterbacks , and this is something that only a center would know , was the feel of his hands . They were never nervous . They were never rushed . It 's hard to explain , but as a center , it 's something you feel . And I felt it . The story of his coolness was not in his face , but his hands . Underneath all that , though , there was an unbelievable competitiveness . You could tell , because it was also visible off the field . Especially off the field . I 'm beating him in golf , and all of a sudden he gets real quiet . A lot of great athletes meditate , but not many people go into a trance . Joe , he would go into a trance . Another example of his competitiveness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleazy hotel . It had a big room near the lobby with all of these electronic games . One of those games was that old electric football game where you move your men by rolling a big ball that sticks out at either end of the field . You remember those games . Anyway , Joe and Steve DeBerg ( the 49ers ' starter at the time ) start playing that game . And they keep playing . And playing . For at least a couple of hours . they played that game . By the end of the day . I looked down at their hands and noticed that they were blue . They had spent the day saying , " You quit ... No , you quit ... No , you quit . " And we were playing a game the next day . I 'm actually surprised that Joe is retiring . I thought as soon as all that stuff came out last year about him quitting ... well , he is the kind of person to pooh-pooh everything and keep playing just to prove everybody wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Joe leaving . football becomes a different deal . I do n't know if there has ever been anybody where the final two minutes have been so automatic . In 1988 , we won a bunch of games in the last two minutes or so . It was like , 11 . Did you know that ? With him around , everybody knew that the 49ers were automatic at the end . That 's not just the way it looked , that 's the way it felt . It was the attitude we had in the huddle . Whether in the Super Bowl or the preseason . With Joe it was like we were just 11 kids from some park trying to beat some other park in a game . That 's all it was . I really appreciated Joe when I had to center for someone else . Like Steve Bono . Any mistakes made between the center and the quarterback , Joe would always shout , " My fault , my fault . " The minute something went wrong with Steve Bono , though , he would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The game I remember most is not the great Super Bowl victories , but an early-season game in Philadelphia in 1989 . Our line made so many mistakes in that game that Joe was sacked or knocked down about six or seven times . I do n't know how he survived , but he did and was still able to throw five touchdown passes . The next week , when we watched the film , ( offensive line coach ) Bobb McKittrick stood up and apologized to the whole team for the poor play of our line . Later that day I 'm sitting in front of my locker , real upset , and Joe walks over . Taps me in the ribs . " Shit happens , " he said . To me , that 's the true Joe Montana , being able to forget about a bad play or bad day , moving on to the next play or next week , overcoming mistakes and being better for them . To me , that 's a man . THE FINAL YEARS Tim Grunhard , 26 , center , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets too high or too low . He 's always on an even keel . That 's what really helped him do so well in those close games . He was always able to transcend the hype for a particular game or a particular play and just stay within himself . That 's something I 'm going to try to learn from him . The best example would probably be from the Denver game from Monday night last year . We had only 1:22 left . But Joe was always on the same keel , telling guys that we would get it done if we concentrate on doing our jobs . A lot of people get nervous , like , " Oh , no , we 've got to make it all up on this one play . " He 's never that way . There was a game in San Diego his first year here . We 're trying to score a touchdown late in the game to win it . He throws incomplete passes on the first three downs . Most quarterbacks I know would have said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm off my game right now . " Joe knew if he stayed level and did what he had to do , he would be successful . He completed the fourth-down pass , we got the first down , we scored a touchdown and we won the game . He was probably the biggest prankster in the locker room . From putting shaving cream into the guys ' helmets to powdering their shoes , it was probably Joe who did it . Everybody was a victim . Nobody was spared . He always found a way to keep that locker room loose . That 's the one thing that 's so important in this league and he did it so well . The one thing that surprised me is that I thought he would be more of a motivator than he really was . I always thought he was one of those guys who was whooping and hollering in the huddle . But he just went about his business . In the two-minute offense , he would always be thinking two , three , four plays ahead , about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this play , or what we would do if the guy did n't get out of bounds , or whatever . He was always ahead of the game , and I think that 's what made him the best two-minute quarterback ever .
