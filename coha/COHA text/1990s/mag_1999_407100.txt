A professional appraiser identifies and evaluates your possessions . BY HELAINE FENDELMAN // Q : A few years ago , a friend gave me these flat wooden flamingos . How old are they and what are they worth ? C.S. , ROCKFORD , ILL . A : Made around 1950 , your lawn ornaments appear to have maintained their original paint and wire legs . Insure the threesome for $125. * Q : No marks suggest the age or origin of this castiron ornament , which measures approximately 15 1/2 " wide by 21 1/2 " tall . The piece 's back is hollowed out . Can you tell me what its original purpose may have been ? W.B. , WILSONVILLE , ORE . A : Your piece of architectural salvage dates to the late 19th century , a time when cast-iron building ornamentation enjoyed great popularity . The piece 's detailing resembles that of a ship 's figurehead . Resist the temptation to clean this object , as doing so would damage its patina and thereby lessen its value . Instead , give the piece a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Q : I purchased this bench because I was intrigued by the backrest 's center medallions , which bear figures depicting the Four Seasons . The shopkeeper told me the bench had been in one family for a long time . How old is it and what is it worth ? S.W. , LA GRANGE , KY . A : A number of factors indicate that your garden bench is a recent reproduction of a late-I9th-century example . First , there is a slickness to the finish that bears no signs of age and wear consistent with outdoor furniture . In addition , there is a lack of definition to the scroll , leaf , and floral motifs . Insurance value for the bench is what a similar piece would cost in a garden store , about $650. * Q : Our family has used this cast-iron planter in the yard for years . It measures about 37 " high and 20 " across . Even though we have lined the inside with plastic , the metal has continued to rust . How would we go about cleaning it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pair , your planter was probably made in the northeastern United States between the middle to the latter part of the I9th century . Such design elements as the stepped pedestal , the scrolled collar around the fluted column , and the impressed scroll motifs at the lip and base confirm this date of manufacture . To clean , gently but firmly remove all the excess rust by using a wire brush . You should then consider spraying the planter with a waterproof sealant in order to retard future deterioration . Plastic actually increases moisture retention , and that 's why your piece rusted even with a liner . Once coated , continue using your planter as you always have and insure it for $1,000. * Q : Several years ago , I discovered this wire plant stand on wheels in a local antiques shop . Its overall height is 37 " , and the basket 's diameter increases from ro " at the bottom to 15 1/2 " at the top . Can you tell me more about this piece ? J.D. , LAPEER , MICH . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your wire plant stand dates to the early part of this century . The intricate wire mesh and decorative detailing are quite charming . Insure the planter for $750. * Send your inquiry , along with a clear color photograph and a self-addressed stamped envelope , to Helaine Fendelman &; Associates , Country Living , RO . Box 271 , Hartsdale , NY 10530 . The volume of inquiries does not always allow us to acknowledge correspondence or return photos . Q : I inherited this appliqued sampler , which is dated 1851 . " BETSY H. MORSE , NEW MILFORD " is stitched beneath the bird . A relative of mine has traced our lineage to Samuel F. B. Morse , the inventor of the telegraph , but I do not know where Betsy fits into the family history . How should I preserve this textile ? What is it worth ? J.A. , OCEAN CITY , N.J. A : You have inherited an appliqued quilt block-not a sampler . Possibly intended for a large quilt that was never completed or perhaps designed as an individual album-quilt block , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a charming little bird added in the center . Unfortunately , the textile 's brown stains indicate deterioration , which will continue unless a fabric restorer can halt or stabilize the process of decay . The cost of preserving the piece may be more than its current value , so you will have to determine how important the heirloom is to you and your family . In the meantime , when displaying this quilt block in your home , be sure to keep it out of direct sunlight . Insure it for $375* Q : I purchased this colorful plate at a flea market for $5 . It measures 13 1/2 " in diameter , and the back bears the mark " CM " in blue . How old is it , and how valuable ? M.A. , MECHANICSBURG , OHIO A : You bought a pottery plaque or charger , a large shallow dish , that was probably made in a country bordering the Mediterranean Sea , perhaps Spain , Italy , or Greece . The initials on the reverse are most likely those of the artist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate , possesses a recent date of manufacture : The depiction of the woman is more caricatural than it is realistic ; the decorative elements are fairly elaborate ; the colors are extraordinarily clear and vibrant . But none of this takes away from the charger 's usefulness or its decorative value . It is certainly worth what you paid for it ! Q : This Tiffany lampshade has been in my husband 's family for more than 70 years . It bears no signature or markings . What is its value ? P.G. , MONROE , CONN . A : Unless a lamp is marked " LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY , " " TIFFANY , " or " LCT , " it is in the Tiffany style and not an authentic example . You do not indicate the size of your leaded- and stained-glass hanging lamp , but its scalloped floral border is attractive . Replacement cost for the piece is $500. * Footnote * " INSURANCE VALUE " REFERS TO AN ITEM 'S REPLACEMENT COST , OR WHAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO PAY FOR AN OBJECT OF SIMILAR AGE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
