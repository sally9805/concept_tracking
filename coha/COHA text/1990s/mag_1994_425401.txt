Section : COMPUTE 'S GETTING STARTED WITH(TM) HOME COMPUTING <p> Buying a computer for the home can be a daunting assignment , especially if it 's your first venture into this fascinating area of personal technology . You 're facing a jungle of odd jargon even more choices of machines and options than breakfast cereals in ' the supermarket , and probably conflicting advice from those around you . It 's so complicated that I ca n't begin to tell you everything you 'll need to know in the short confines of these articles . This time around , I 'll concentrate on the most frequently asked questions and considerations involved in buying computers specifically for the home , which is certainly an art unto itself . How Much Should You Spend ? <p> The first step in the process is to determine how much you can spend for this new addition to your home , You can buy excellent if somewhat Spartan computers for about $1,000 , or you can spend as much as $4,000 if you feel you need the latest model , the fastest chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices is always scary ; the PC market changes so fast that there 's no telling what will happen in the two months it takes to get these words into print-except that prices will go down . ) <p> The best advice I can give is to buy as much computer as you can reasonably afford . It often seems that all the hot new software products require state-of-the-art equipment . If you buy slightly out-of-date hardware today , by this time next year , you 'll find yourself unable to run many of the great new programs that I 'll be writing about here . In other words , do n't buy a 386SX computer unless you 're sure you want to run only last year 's software , and you wo n't be catching upgrade fever . <p> And if possible , consider getting a chip-upgradable computer in case the upgrade pressure becomes unbearable . Should You Get Multimedia <p> Yes . That one was easy . Why get multimedia ? Without it , you 'll be on the outside looking in . You 'll be unable to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software today is pretty spectacular , but I have the feeling that we have n't seen anything yet . Do n't miss out . <p> Another good reason to include the CD-ROM drive and sound board as part of your computer purchase is that it 's much easier that way . Until the planned Plug and Play standards become reality-at least a year , probably longer-installing a CD-ROM drive and sound board in an existing computer can be an exercise in frustration . Even if the thought of taking screwdriver in hand to open the computer case does n't give you a mild case of the , shakes , you 're likely to have problems , IRQs conflict , DMA channels get crossed , tiny jumpers must be moved , and DIP switches must be changed . <p> Let your dealer worry about all that-buy the computer with everything installed and working . Happily , it 's often less expensive to buy the multimedia kit built in . ( But be sure that you know which components you 're getting and that they 're the ones you want . Many built-ins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Match Your School 's Hardware ? <p> Often , one of the main reasons you 're buying a home computer is to be sure your children are n't left behind in the virtual dust on the information superhighway . How important is it to have the same kind of computer the kids use at school ? <p> Opinions vary . Kids are generally versatile creatures , able to switch mental gears as they move from old Apple II 's still found in some schools to Amigas , Macintoshes , and IBM compatibles . They consider the varieties of computers to be part of the landscape and are n't fazed by the need to know how to use different varieties of tools . Get the computer that you know how to use ; the kids will adjust without difficulty . That 's my advice . Others may advise differently . <p> ( Because this is a PC magazine , I 'll assume that after careful consideration you 've decided on an IBM compatible for your home . ) Ca n't Kids Got Along with a Smaller , Slower Computer ? <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the latest games , which are notorious for stretching your hardware to its limits . Current games often require absolutely the fastest , most RAM-rich hardware you can buy to play at even a decent speed . If that does n't bother you ( " My kids are going to use the computer only for educational programs , " you say ) , be aware that reference titles and other educational programs are now on CD-ROM with fancy full-motion video clips that play slowly even on today 's fastest computers . <p> Even if the computer is only for the kids , get at least a 486SX-25 with 4MB of RAM and a 120MB hard drive . That 's the bare minimum . Even for a second machine , I would n't buy anything less than a 486DX33 with 4MB of RAM and a 200MB hard drive . If I anticipated heavy Windows use ( and I do ) , I 'd get 8MB of RAM if it were in any way possible . Those are the minimums . <p> Would You Be Better Off with Two Computers ? Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually , this happens as a longtime computer owner buys a newer , more modern computer . The old one is then relegated to the kids . ( But Dad and Mom often find themselves doing their word processing on the old machine because the kids need the CD-ROM-equipped computer to do their schoolwork or play their games . ) At the Mann Mansion , it 's not unusual for our family of four to be happily working away on four separate computers ( We own two and usually have several systems in for review . ) Having at least two is an absolute necessity around here . <p> If you think you may need two computers for your family , consider making one of them a laptop computer . Today 's laptops ( primarily notebooks and subnotebooks ) are surprisingly capable computers at relatively affordable prices . The minimum configuration mentioned above is fairly standard for notebook computers . ( Give it another year or two , and you may even be able to afford a color-screen notebook computer , ) Where Should You Buy Your Computer ? <p> Deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've advised dozens of friends on their home computer purchases , I 've found that two factors seem to take a controlling role in the decision : price and available financing . <p> Local furniture stores do a brisk business in computers because they offer easy credit and many buyers already have accounts there . Little or no money down , immediate delivery , and easy payments carry a lot of weight . <p> Others who can afford to buy outright or charge the computer to a credit card usually go for the lowest price from a nationally known mail-order vendor ( often Gateway 2000 ) . Others search the local dealers for the best price and features , looking forward to having locally available service and advice an excellent idea . The warehouse stores are also doing a brisk business in lowpriced PCs . <p> Buying a computer for your home can be a lot of fun . Involve the family , after explaining the basic constraints , and have fun sharing the anticipation of having one of these tool-and entertainment-device combinations in your home . <p> PHOTO : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer . <p> PHOTO : Add multimedia to your PC with a multimedia upgrade kit . <p> PHOTO : Create rainy-day projects with Broderbund 's Kid Cuts . <p> By Richard O.
