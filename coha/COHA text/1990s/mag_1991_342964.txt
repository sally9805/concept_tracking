When a high-level delegation from Iraq began meetings with Iranian officials in Tehran Jan. 8 , the sessions attracted little notice . After all , at that same moment U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz were preparing to hold their last-minute talks in Geneva , and the clock was ticking toward war . But political analysts in Washington and the Middle East now believe a deal might have been struck at those meetings in the Iranian capital , a deal that last week triggered one of the more mysterious events of the gulf war : the sudden departure for Iran of the cream of the Iraqi air force . <P> The migration , which was suspected to total 100 planes , left allied officials perplexed . " It 's tough for me to put any kind of interpretation on what 's going on , " said chief of allied operations General H. Norman &lt; Schwarzkopf . If Saddam Hussein was behind the exodus  --  and that was not absolutely certain  --  his goal was obvious : to save his air force from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had motivated Iran to give a helping hand to its erstwhile enemy ? <P> No clear explanation came from Tehran . Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani did assure the U.S.-led coalition , however , that the decision to provide sanctuary to some of Saddam 's most sophisticated French and Soviet fighters and most of his SU-24 Fencer bombers would not affect Iran 's neutral status . The planes , Iranian officials said , will be impounded and held until hostilities end . They also insisted that no deal had been cut with Baghdad in advance . <P> Whether that is true or not , the decision to hold on to Saddam 's planes allows Tehran to play each side against the other in the gulf conflict , to its own advantage . By facilitating the removal of some 10% of Iraq 's planes from combat , Iran earns the gratitude of the U.S. and its allies . " These aircraft are capable of reaching Israel , and their absconding from Iraq greatly reduces Iraq 's war potential , " said Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens last week . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that should he outlast the U.N . coalition , he can still retain some of his military muscle . By helping out Saddam , Rafsanjani is assuaging the feelings of radical Islamic factions within Iran 's parliament , who are unhappy to see Iran ignore the pummeling of fellow Muslims by Western forces . <P> In its public pronouncements , Iran has expressed only contempt for the goals of the U.S.-led coalition . Yet few diplomats , including top U.S. specialists , doubt that Tehran is determined to remain a bystander in the conflict . " I would be flabbergasted if Iran made a 180 degrees turn , violated the U.N . resolutions and sacrificed its neutrality , " says a European envoy in Riyadh . Says a senior British diplomat in London : " Iran has nothing to gain by getting involved in the war against the allies . Among other things , its military is in terrible shape as a result of the Iran-Iraq war . " <P> Anti-American rhetoric by Islamic extremists in Tehran is not to be taken seriously . " It is for domestic , anti-imperialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans , " says an Iranian political scientist living in Paris . " Even the Iranian Revolutionary Guards are in no mood to join the hostilities . "
