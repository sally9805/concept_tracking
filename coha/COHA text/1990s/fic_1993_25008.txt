 | " White ? Dirty white ? " " In London we call it Isabella . After Queen Isabella , who vowed never to change her petticoats until the Moors were driven from Spain . You do n't want people to laugh when they see your clothes  --  and you do n't want to remind Elizabeth of another queen , and a queen of Spain at that . " " Ah . Ah , I see . It 's all far more complicated than it looks , is n't it ? " " Aye , " Christopher said , and left before the man could call forth more pity from him . Christopher sat at his desk again later that day , staring absently at the confusion of paper in front of him . He had gone back to the stairs after his talk with Potter , hoping to see the actor again , but the man had disappeared . Someone there told him that the masque would not take place for another week , that the actor playing the queen had been so taken with his costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other players . Were the strange men he had overheard rehearsing a masque ? It seemed unlikely . If that was the sort of performance given at the queen 's court then he should hasten to offer his services ; he could do better in his sleep . Thoughts of the masque reminded him of the play in his travel bag . He took it out , pushed aside Sir Philip 's correspondence and read over what he had written so far . Someone knocked on the door . He covered the play with a book . " Come , " he said . To his surprise Geoffrey Ryder entered . " How did you find me ? " Christopher asked . " I asked . It was n't difficult . " Christopher looked at him in amazement . The man had n't the faintest idea what he was doing ; not for the first time he wondered why the earl of Essex had chosen him for this sort of work . Anyone who could reason logically would realize now that Christopher was no mere secretary but a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Essex 's . If enough people became suspicious he might just as well go home .  | It could n't be helped . " Is Will here ? " he asked . " He 's in the gallery , talking with some friends . " Geoffrey looked around him , then down at the papers on the desk . " They could have given you a larger room , at least . Do you know what Philip Potter is supposed to have done ? " Christopher sighed . " Of course I do . He 's my employer , after all . Did you come here only to pass along rumor ? I have work to do . " " I wanted to see how you were getting on . To exchange information . We agreed to work together , after all . " " And what information do you have ? " Geoffrey hesitated . " Nothing , to be honest . That 's why I came . I hoped you had discovered something . " " The season for gift-giving is past . " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our queen . Time grows short and we 're no closer to discovering who 's behind this conspiracy . In two days it will be April already . April with his showers sweet , they say , but will we enjoy them if the queen is dead ? " Christopher looked at him sharply . Could the voice he had heard have been Geoffrey 's ? Was that why it had sounded so familiar ? And did Geoffrey ask him for information now because he wanted to see if his plot had been found out ? The man did not seem the sort to quote poetry . " What do you know about ? " Christopher began , but at that moment someone opened the door behind Geoffrey and came into the room . " Kit ! " Will said . The room seemed almost too small to contain both brothers . " They 've made you a scrivener , I hear . " " Aye . " Did the whole world know his business ? He might just as well have posted a sign at Paul 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear the whole story behind Potter 's disgrace . Geoffrey seemed about to make certain he knew it . " The man 's an ass , " Geoffrey said . " He met an actor dressed as the queen on the stairs ? " " Oh , I heard all about that downstairs , " Will said . " He wo n't keep his appointment , I hope . "  | To Christopher 's surprise the other man seemed to care about what happened to Potter . None of the courtiers had been at all concerned about poor Sir Philip . " Come , Will  --  why should n't he ? " Geoffrey said . " No one at court could write a more amusing comedy . " " For one thing , if he kept his appointment I would have to leave , " Christopher said . " I told him not to go . " " Do n't scowl , Geoffrey , the man 's right , " Will said . " Kit needs a reason to be here . He could n't very well walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second time in as many sentences Will had surprised him . He cared about Potter , true , but he had not lost the unconscious arrogance of the nobility . Looking at him now Christopher could see that he had no idea how offensive he had been ; he had as good as said that anyone at court would be able to tell Christopher was no gentleman . " You were about to say something before Will interrupted , " Geoffrey said . " What do I know about what ? " " About a group of people here at court , " Christopher said , shrugging off Will 's comments . " They 're small and seem oddly misshapen . They 're petitioning the queen about their ancestral rights . " Will grinned at him . " Their ancestral rights ! " he said , delighted . " Is this a story ? " " Nay  --  they 're quite real , I assure you . " " I 've never seen them . I 'll wager even the queen does n't know about them . Tell me more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking at Geoffrey . The other man had not betrayed any knowledge of the folks Christopher had seen . Could it be that he truly knew nothing ? Or was it only that he was a very good actor ? He did not see Will and Geoffrey for another week , until the afternoon of the masque . Then he caught sight of them a little ahead of him , among the great crowd of people going into the Presence Chamber . He nearly called out , but at that moment he spotted Sir Philip Potter , dressed in what seemed like every color but Isabella .  | Christopher moved through the crowd , working his way toward Potter . What did the man think he was doing ? The sight of him in the same room with the actor playing the queen would doubtless set the court to laughing again . " Sir Philip , " he said . " Aye ? " Philip said amiably . " Who are you ? " They had stopped in the middle of the crowd . He took Sir Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you not to come here , " he said softly . " You told ? Oh , aye . I know you now . But surely they 've forgotten everything after all this time . Do n't you think so ? " A courtier passed them and pointed out Sir Philip to the woman leaning against his arm . Christopher did n't think they had forgotten a thing . " Remember what I told you , " he said fiercely . " Say nothing . Give them no cause for amusement . " Sir Philip stepped back a little , alarm showing in his face . Probably no servant of his had ever given him such forceful advice . He nodded meekly and they went into the Presence Chamber together . They were among the last to enter . Christopher found two places on a bench at the rear of the chamber , and looked around him after they had settled themselves . The queen sat on a carved wooden chair at the front and to the side of the audience , surrounded by her courtiers and maids-of-honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by conversation . Will and Geoffrey sat a few rows ahead of them . Will turned and , on seeing him , smiled his extraordinary smile . Christopher nodded back . The music of the consort grew louder ; folks turned their attention to the stage . A painted mountain stretching nearly to the ceiling was wheeled in . The mountain opened , revealing seven women who stepped down to the stage to dance . The music grew wilder , and the women , dressed in artful rags of black and red , began to dance faster and faster until , quite suddenly , they stopped . The queen applauded enthusiastically . Sir Philip clapped loudly as well , until Christopher forced his hands to his lap . 104 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Only then did the courtiers begin to applaud , and finally the rest of the audience . Philip grinned at him , wholly caught up in the merriment . What am I to do with you ? Christopher thought . One of the dancers stepped forward to speak . Because he and Philip sat at the back they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of people in front of him . " Who is she ? " he whispered loudly . " Some vice or other  --  Falsehood or Slander or Discord . Hush . " " Discord ? What is Discord doing there ? " " She 's to be vanquished by the Virtues . " " How do you know ? " A few people in front of them turned and looked at Philip . " Everyone knows , " Christopher said . " I 'll explain it to you later . " There was a puff of smoke and a loud burst of music , and then the mountain was hurriedly wheeled off the stage and a large castle wheeled on . Seven knights issued from the castle . One of the knights came forward and began a speech describing the Heroic Virtues , with himself , Order , as the chief of them . Philip glanced at Christopher admiringly . Had the man never seen a masque before ? " Who 's that ? " Philip whispered . Christopher frowned . A man wearing an ordinary doublet and hose had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked odd among the allegorical costumes of the players ; only the mask covering his eyes set him apart from the audience . The man moved forward and addressed the hall , speaking for a long time on the subject of Discord and Order . Order , behind him , looked angry and upset . Christopher had seen enough of actors to know that this part had not been rehearsed ; the man had enlarged his speech beyond what had been written for him . And the verses were poor , not nearly as polished as the speeches that had gone before . " Who ? " Sir Philip said . " Quiet . " The man began to talk about falseness , the false order imposed on a people by tyranny . Suddenly Christopher understood what was happening : the man was not part of the  | masque at all . He stood quickly . Several people in front of him began to stand as well , and someone called out something he could not hear . " We here abolish Discord , and do sing , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new king . " To Christopher 's astonishment Arthur stepped out on stage . The man in the mask raised a gun . Several people screamed . The knights seemed stunned , unable to move . The man fumbled with the gun , pushing the cover away from the pan filled with priming powder . Then he leveled it at the queen . An explosive noise filled the chamber . The queen slumped in her chair . For a long moment no one moved . The assassin smiled oddly beneath his mask ; he seemed almost to be waiting for applause . Then several men rushed the stage , and more hurried toward the queen . Amazingly , no one seemed to be paying any attention to Arthur . The young man stood uncertainly for a moment and then ran off the stage and through the room . Christopher followed , trying to keep him in sight among the crowd . Arthur forced his way past the people in the Presence Chamber . A few of those he pushed shouted after him , but most seemed more interested in the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they left the chamber . Arthur hurried along the gallery and out of the palace . Christopher ran after him . Arthur kept the Thames on his right , heading toward the great manors on the river 's edge . Up ahead Christopher could see the gray bulk of the Ryders ' house , and he wondered again about Geoffrey 's part in the conspiracy . But Arthur did not even glance up as they passed the house . Instead he looked behind him quickly , and when he saw Christopher he put on a burst of speed . Christopher fell behind when Arthur passed through Ludgate and into London proper . The other man seemed tireless . He was near St. Paul 's now , pushing through the crowds that surrounded the churchyard . Christopher strained to keep him in sight . A half a mile later Arthur came to Gracechurch Street and turned left . By the time Christopher turned the corner there was no sign of him . 106 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Excellent , he thought , panting . What would he say to Poley now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . Suddenly he grinned and looked up at the street in front of him . He knew exactly where Arthur was going . He took a deep breath and walked quickly toward the Saracen 's Head . Fifteen minutes later he came to the tavern and went inside . Arthur sat at one of the tables , deep in conversation with Tom Nashe . The man he had chased through London seemed at his ease , not even winded . Tom raised his head as he came in and called , " Kit ! " Arthur looked up . Christopher could see in his face that until that moment he had had no idea who had followed him ; he was only now beginning to work out what had happened . Arthur rose , nearly tripping over the bench in his haste . He moved back against the wall . Christopher stood at the only door to the room ; the other man was trapped . Arthur looked around him frantically , seeking an exit . " What ? " Tom said . The air in front of Arthur turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him carefully . He hesitated for a long moment , and then walked through the shining curtain and disappeared .  | Anthony Drury knocked at a door and waited . They had taken a different , winding route to the house , but George thought it was the same place he and Anthony had visited before . Piles of refuse  --  horse dung and rotting vegetables  --  overflowed the gutters and lay along the unpaved paths . The houses presented mean , closed faces toward the street . Anthony knocked again . This time they heard footsteps , and then a deep voice spoke from behind the door . " What was a month old at Cain 's birth that 's not five weeks old as yet ? " " The moon , " Anthony said . George felt relieved that Anthony had known the answer ; he was not very good at riddles . Then the door opened and he realized that Anthony had n't answered a riddle at all but had given a correct password . They had been set some sort of test . By the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had glimpsed before . It was pear-shaped , with arms of metal snaking out from it in all directions . Alchemy , he thought , with a quick shock of excitement . He had been right . And then , Will they teach me ? The alembic squatted on the wooden floor . Next to it was a table , and on the table stood bottles and stones and retorts and opened books . 108 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | When he looked up he saw that there were two other men in the room . One stood in the shadows , and George could see only that he was small and had some sort of stain down the front of his doublet . But it was the other man who drew George 's attention . He had long flowing white hair and a white beard , but his bones were sharp and clear and his face seemed that of a young man . He looked at George with dark brown eyes under heavy black eyebrows , and seemed to read all of George 's secrets at a glance . The man turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now George realized that beneath his long gown he had strong , well-defined muscles . " You say you can vouch for this man ? " " Aye , " Anthony said . " His name is George Cowper . He has promised to lead us to the woman 's son . " " Excellent , " the man said , his voice so pleasant and full of authority that it was several moments before George thought , But I promised nothing . Anthony never kept his part of the bargain . " George , this is Paul Hogg , " Anthony said . " Good day , " George said . With anyone else he would have been tempted to laugh at the absurd name , but here in this house , in front of this man , he could find nothing amusing about it . Where Anthony burned with his fanaticism , seemed always on the verge of winning through to some goal , Paul Hogg looked as if he lacked nothing , as if he had already achieved his desire . " Good day , " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our work ? " " Nothing , " Anthony said . " I left that for you . " " You 've seen the alembic , " Paul Hogg said . " Our purpose here is to discover the secrets of Dame Alchemia . I know the first eleven steps in the process  --  I lack only the twelfth , the final one . See here ? " He put his hand on the alembic but did not open it . " I 've performed the first three steps , calcination , solution and separation . And over the course of a year or so I 'll do the rest , and learn the final step . And then I 'll have it , the lapis philosophorum , Philosopher 's Stone . All metals it touches p 109 will become gold , the perfect metal , and all men it touches will live forever . " Live forever , George thought , and the idea was so breathtaking , so fanciful , that he laughed . " Aye , even you , George , " Hogg said . " Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anthony will live forever . " He wondered why Hogg had chosen him , someone who had had no training at all in the sciences . But he knew enough not to ask . " What do we do next ? " he said . Hogg did not answer him . Instead he inscribed a circle around the four of them , chanting words George thought might be Latin . Sorcery , George thought , remembering his earlier misgivings . How would this help him win Alice ? Why had he come ? He made a move to leave but was stopped by Hogg 's strong , confident voice . And after a while he no longer wanted to go , could not remember , in fact , why he had ever moved toward the door . Anthony had assured him that everything they did had a basis in natural philosophy . And surely a man as wise as Hogg would not put his soul in peril . Then Hogg stood and said three sharp words . The roof blew off ; they stood on an empty plain with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the wind screaming around him ? The plain seemed to stretch out forever . There were no rocks , no trees , no houses , only the other men to catch and hold the eye . Hogg cursed in several languages . A black shape lit by flickering fire came toward them . As it came closer George could see it was a horse , but larger than any horse he had ever seen . It walked on its hind legs and its eyes were as white as moons . Fire played around its hooves . Hogg said something , tried again as the horse came on . The horse 's neighing sounded like demonic laughter . " Back ! " Hogg said over the rising wind . " Go back , and fetch your master ! " The horse wheeled around in a circle , laughing , and then left . No one spoke or moved . George shivered in terror and looked at Hogg , but the other man paid no attention to him . His jaw was clenched and he stared at the horizon as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined , prepared to stay all day if necessary . The wind grew louder . 110 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | The other men looked terrified . Something scuttled near them ; something else called out , chittering . Wings flapped near George 's eyes and he closed them in fear , but the darkness frightened him more and he opened them again at once . The noises around them grew louder : the shapes were drawing closer . Then he heard the neighing again . The horse had re-turned . Something man-shaped rode it this time , keeping its balance effortlessly as the horse danced on two legs . It looked like the thing that had followed Anthony to his lodgings , but whether it was the same or not George could n't say . " I asked for your master , " Hogg said . The rider laughed . " Are we yours , then , to order about as you please ? " it said . Its voice sounded unpleasant , like water coiling past old roots and rocks . It spoke with difficulty through its many sharp teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when to go ? We made a bargain , nothing more . " " Aye , a bargain . I was promised gold . Where is your master ? " The horse wheeled again . " Gold ! " the rider said . " When will you ask us for something real ? " Hogg said something in a language George did n't recognize . The rider made no move that George could see , but a large purse fell at Hogg 's feet . Hogg leapt for it . " It turns to coal unless your part of the bargain is kept , " the rider said . Then the shabby room came up around them again . George looked at the other men in the room , at the alembic , at the table littered with tools . He felt he was in a dream and that at any moment he might wake , that the room around him would vanish a second time and he would find himself safe and in his bed . " What ? " he said . " They are not demons , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not heard him come up next to him . George shook his head . How could he be certain of anything Hogg told him ? " It 's easy enough to make the distinction , " Hogg said , almost as if he had read George 's thoughts . " They live in light . Their enemies live in darkness . Their enemies are the children of Cain . "  | " The children ? " " The woman Alice knows them well . She has had dealings with them , if I 'm not mistaken . " George nodded . He could see now how everything fit together , how right he had been to chastise Alice . " We must stop her . Her and the children of darkness . The folks I called up here will help us . You understand now that it is lawful to trade with them . " " What  --  what was the bargain you made ? " " I asked for the secrets of alchemy . They will , of course , give nothing away . I promised them a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George knew what he promised to trade . " Alice 's son , " he said . " Aye . " " What do they want with him ? " " I do n't know . But I can tell you that her son is a sort of child of Cain himself , that he comes from the darkness . If we give him to them we are doing nothing wrong . " Hogg untied the purse he had been given and poured out a handful of shining coins . Gold . " Here , " he said . " For your help in this matter . " George took the coins . They were sovereigns , he saw , and felt cool and weighty in his hand . He could expand his business , buy more books and copyrights . He did n't need Alice and her stall at all . And with this gold and the money he would soon be earning he could have any woman he wanted . He would not be balked by her stubbornness again . " They will turn to coal if the bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that you 've bought with them will vanish as well . We must have the boy to trade . " George 's heart began to beat faster . He ran his thumb over the coins in his hand . " But Alice herself has not seen her son in years , " he said , and then wondered if he should have given away so much . Would Hogg want his gold back if he thought George could not help him ? " Then what you must do , " Hogg said , his voice low and soothing , " is have her lose her membership in the Stationers ' Company . Without her livelihood she will be forced to go to her 112 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | son for help . We know that with her husband dead she has no one she can turn to in the churchyard . " He marveled that Hogg 's commands should come so near to his own heart 's desire . With Alice out of the company he would never be reminded of his failure with her , of her immoral ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There is a reason man has been put above woman , " Hogg said . He was whispering now , drawing them into a conspiracy of two and excluding Anthony and the other man . " A woman on her own does not have the logic or the will to resist evil . " " How am Ito have her lose her membership ? " George asked . " Ah . I 'm sure you 'll think of something . " Margery 's note had said only , " Come visit me on Sunday . " Alice felt her usual exasperation when dealing with her friend ; since Margery did n't go to church she assumed that no one else did . When Sunday came Alice went to services at St. Faith 's beneath the choir of Paul 's , the stationers ' church . Then she made her way toward Ludgate and out of London . Margery surprised her by having a visitor . They both sat under her windows , the sun coming in weakly through the unwashed glass and making them look as if lit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut-brown and completely round , with a wide , thick , smiling mouth to draw attention away from the fact that she had almost no chin . She seemed to grow fatter as Alice looked downward , her shoulders slightly plump but her stomach and hips padded to the shape of a ball . She looked very much at home in Margery 's strange cottage . " Agnes was telling me a story , " Margery said . " I think you 'll be interested too . She comes from near your village , Alice . " " Aye , " Agnes said . She took one of Margery 's apples and she bit into it , and then said nothing more for several seconds . Perhaps she was going over the story in her mind . " I 'm a midwife , " she said finally . " One night a man came to the door and summoned me to a birth . He was a strange one , I remember . Very short , less than four feet tall , and his hair was long and p 113 black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ears were pointed , like an animal 's . I 'd never seen him before . " I told my husband I 'd be out for the night . Will you be taking the horse ? ' he asked me , but the little man said , Nay , there 's no need . ' We went outside and I saw his horse tied to a tree . " I mounted up behind him . I was younger and lighter in those days  --  this was near twenty years ago , did I say ? Aye , twenty , or a little more . We rode quickly , making good time . I 'd tell you where we went , but I could n't see the way . It was dark , and fog lay like a hand over us . Many times since then I 've tried to find the road we took , but I never could . We stopped at a hill , and I 'd swear I 'd never seen that hill before in my life . " When we got off the horse the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be frightened , ' and he breathed on my eye . And for some reason I was n't afraid . Then the hill opened , and we went inside . " It was ? Oh , it was fine . I ca n't describe it . Walls of gold and silver . Men and women dressed in mail as light as cobwebs , with swords as sharp as diamonds . Music like nothing I 'd ever heard . No candles , and you could n't see the moon or stars overhead , but light came from all around . And from the peo-ple 's faces , too  --  but they were n't people , were they ? They were of Faerie . " They were in a long hall , feasting , at a table laid with silk and linen , with crystal goblets and silver plate . Everyone stopped when we came in , and one of the men stood and came over to us . Is this the best you could do ? ' he said to the little man . He had horns , but somehow it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sharp as sword-points . " The little man shrugged . I thought he liked me , that he might feel badly about the other man 's rudeness , but now I wonder if that was true . They do n't have feelings the way we do . He smiled , and when he did his mouth stretched nearly to his ears , but he said nothing . " This second man motioned to me to follow him out of the hall . Tiny creatures flew past us , and I saw more little men , and women carrying fire on their heads . Tapestries of fine silk hung 114 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | on the wall , and when I looked at them they seemed to move . I could n't see much as we hurried past , but I thought I saw small creatures mounted on the backs of birds , fighting with lances the size of needles . And men in silver armor , their faces upturned as dragons spewed fire . But it was hard to think of battles in such a place as that . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to , and when I saw her nothing seemed strange or unusual . I knew what to do , why I had come . The man had left , and I was in a room full of women . I went straight to the birthing stool and helped her . She did n't cry out the way other mothers do , and the birth was an easy one . The child was a boy , and healthy . When it was over I got mugwort from my bag to ease her belly . " All the time I attended her I knew who she was . She wore no crown , of course , just a light gown made of gossamer . But she was the queen . I could tell by the way the other ladies deferred to her , but even if she 'd been alone I 'd have known it . " When it was over the little man came into the room again , and the horned man with him . The little man carried a bundle in his arms . Quickly , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll sleep for a while now . ' The women had moved the queen to the bed , and she lay nursing her son . You must give him up , Oriana , ' the horned man said . For his safety , and for ours . ' " The queen looked at her son one last time , and then gave him to the little man . And the man passed over his bundle , which I saw was a baby , a human boy . When the little man got the queen 's baby he took it and ran out of the room . The other one looked at me with his hard eyes and said , This should not have been done in front of her . ' " She 'll forget , ' the queen said . " ' I ' 11 see that she will , ' the man said , and he took a step toward me . I knew he was going to breathe on my eye , and I closed them both as tightly as I could . But even so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my house the next morning , with my husband coming out to look for me. " p 115 Agnes seemed to have finished her tale . " The queen , " Alice said , remembering . " I saw her too . She 's beautiful , is n't she ? " " I did n't bring you both here to compare stories , " Margery said sharply . " The queen is not our concern . Think , Alice . The boy . The son . " A new thought , horrible and troubling , struggled to come to light . " Nay , " Alice said . " It ca n't be true ? " " It is , " Margery said . " The son , the human baby . That was Arthur . " " Nay ! " Alice said again . " Aye , it was . And the child you raised as yours was of Faerie . A prince of Faerie , the queen 's own child . " " He 's not ? " Alice said .

He has been well cared for , at least . " " But why ? " She remembered the queen in her circle of lights , the strange kinship she had felt between them , and she wondered how such a fair-seeming creature could have done something so ugly . " They 're fighting a battle , " Margery said . " They live long , and they have children seldom , so the queen 's son had to be protected above all else . If the child was captured the war would be lost . They gave him to you , to keep him safe . " Alice realized , to her own great surprise , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted only to see her son ; it was a feeling as sudden and as strong as being struck by lightning . She wanted to comfort him , to show him his true , human birthright . Oriana was not there to feel her anger , but Margery was . " Did you know all this ? " she asked . " Did you watch Arthur as he grew , laughing to think that he would soon be taken from me ? " " Nay . I did not guess about Arthur until very recently . I saw that the Fair Folk were moving toward London , leaving their 116 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | true home in the fields and woods , but I thought they came here for another reason . People in the country are being thrown off their land , you know  --  the landlords are turning all their cropland to pasture . And so the homeless folk are coming here to find work . I thought that the faeries followed them  --  they need to be with people in some way we ca n't understand . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know .

" " Do I ? The world is changing , moving in a direction I can not predict . The Fair Folk have a part to play in all this , but whether it is large or small I can not say . " Margery 's talk of cropland and changes only made Alice impatient ; all her concern was with Arthur . " Did n't Oriana ? " " Oriana tells me very little . When I saw the faerie-light on your child I knew what he was , of course . But it was only when I found Agnes that I realized he was the queen 's son .

And they have to get him back , to win the war . " " The man in black , asking about Arthur ! But he was human , I 'd swear to it . " " Aye . Both sides recruit humans , when they need them . " " Both . . . Then the others are looking for him too ? " " Aye , " Margery said . " And they must not get him . We must find the queen 's son first , and trade him for yours . " " How ? " Alice said , despairing . " A friend saw him once , but he lost him again . The Saracen 's Head , that 's all he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard of him . "  | " You 're not alone in this . I 'm with you , and I know more about the faeries than a dozen men in black . We 'll find him . " Alice was not so certain . How were they to get Arthur back , two women against the combined might of Faerie ? The despair had gone , though ; she felt to her own horror that her strongest desire was that Oriana should lose the war . The Stationers ' Company met in a hall east of St. Paul 's . Rows of cushioned benches faced the front , where speakers would stand and address the rest of the company . Behind that was a fireplace taking up nearly the entire wall . Once , Alice remembered , the stationers had used it to burn all the copies of a book Archbishop Whitgift had declared immoral . She thought that that was the sorriest thing she had ever seen , all that work and knowledge and thought rising up the chimney in flames . The stationers had closed their stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them that their absence was hardly noticed : the business of the gallants and usurers and cutpurses went on as usual . Nearly everyone had come to the hall except two men down with the ague . As Alice looked around she noticed , as she noticed at every meeting , that she was the only woman in the room . Speaker after speaker stood and moved to the front . Elections were coming up ; names were proposed for the offices of junior warden , senior warden and master . A stationer rose to warn the company that spies from the Privy Council had been through the churchyard , looking for unlicensed books . One printer accused another of stealing his copyright ; the other claimed he had been given the copyright , but could not prove that it had been by the author . Manuscripts were frequently copied by scriveners and passed from reader to reader , and too often an unscrupulous printer would publish a book from a third-hand copy . The second printer was ordered to give up his copyright and was fined , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , and Alice , her mind on her son , found it hard to pay attention . " Has anyone other business ? " the Mas-118 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | ter of the Company said , and Alice looked up with relief . The meeting would soon be over . " Aye , " someone said . The stationers turned to watch as George Cowper made his way to the front of the room . Someone murmured ; George , like Alice , had never spoken at a meeting before . He stood dwarfed by the vast fireplace open like a mouth behind him . " I propose that the company reconsider the membership of one of the stationers . " The murmurs grew louder . " Who ? " the master asked . " Alice Wood , " George said , his voice clear and strong . Alice had been thinking of other things . She looked up , a little surprised to hear her name . " Alice ? " someone said from the audience . " For God 's sake , man , why ? " George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immoral living , " he said . " And necromancy. "  | Tom Nashe blinked as Arthur disappeared before him . Christopher moved quickly , stepping through the curtain of gold after the other man . Tom could not bear to let them go without him . He hesitated only a moment and then followed . It was dark where he found himself , the way lit by a pale three-quarters moon and scattered stars . He looked around , puzzled . He knew he had been sitting in the tavern for a few hours , but surely night could not have fallen yet . Christopher , ahead of him , was a dark blur against the black , and he could not see Arthur at all . He hurried after his friend . The way lightened before him , though not by any agency of the moon ; it seemed instead that light seeped outward from the rocks and trees . He found himself wandering in a grove of old elms and oaks , following a narrow path covered with leaves and moss and stones . He heard a stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up from the path he saw that Christopher had disappeared . He ran to catch up with him . The strange light made dappling overlapping shadows of the leaves ; he blundered into roots or rocks and nearly went sprawling . Suddenly it seemed to him as if he were the focus of some-  | one 's , or something 's , scrutiny , as if everything in the land had turned the vast weight of its attention on him . The force of that gaze was so strong that he had to stop his headlong rush for a moment , to stand and let whatever it was study him . He felt as he had on that strange journey through London : that the inhabitants of this land hunted something , something they had lost . Then the feeling passed , as if the eyes that probed him so intently had released him , allowed him to go . What was it they searched for ? Could it be Arthur ? Someone beckoned to him up ahead , near a bend in the road , and he forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely see it through the trees , a squat misshapen man not even a foot high . But when he came to the bend what he thought was a man resolved itself into an old gnarled stone . He looked at it for a moment and continued on . The stone  --  the man  --  moved at the corner of his vision . He glanced back quickly but saw only stone , nothing more . Something called out to the moon , a lonely , yearning cry . The voice of the stream changed , became a sound like music heard far off . Farther down the road a hand reached out to him from one of the trees . He quickened his pace . Someone laughed , and an animal padded quickly away from him as he ran . The laughter came from above him , in the trees . He looked around and saw nothing but branches and twigs swaying in the wind . Then a woman stepped from the trees . She had long dark-brown hair , and he decided the moment he saw her that that color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her skin was nut-brown , nearly as dark as her hair , and her fingers long as twigs . She looked at him boldly and motioned to him with those fingers , then ran away down the path . He could do nothing else but follow her . The path widened . She stopped for a moment and turned as if to make certain of him ; he saw to his surprise that her eyes were as blue as berries . She hurried along the path to a meadow . More of the nut-brown women sat by a stream and wove garlands out of the flowers around them . The women reached for her as she ran to them . They bound her hair in a garland of flowers , laughing and calling to one  | another . When they had done she turned away from him and studied her reflection in the stream . Had she forgotten him ? Or had he misunderstood her  --  had her gaze been disinterested after all ? He followed her through the meadow . The grass was soft , and greener than any April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he came up to her . For once in his life he could think of nothing to say . She took a silver flower from the garland in her hair and held it out to him wordlessly . He reached for it , and as he did so the meadow before him , the stream , the women , all disappeared . In the space of a breath he found himself back at the tavern , holding the flower she had given him . He returned to the tavern the next day . Christopher and Arthur had not come back with him the night before , and he had spent the rest of the evening waiting for them and studying the flower in his hand . He had never seen another like it ; its silver petals curved upward and together like the groin of an old church and then unfurled outward . He wondered where the others had gone to . More than that , he wanted an explanation for everything that had happened , starting with who Arthur was . Did it have something to do with Kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man come into the tavern . The man was stocky , with brown hair and eyes , and he walked with the confident air of the nobility . He looked nothing like the other young men Christopher brought into the tavern from time to time , and Tom wondered who he could be . But if Kit thought the presence of the other man would keep him from asking questions he would soon learn how wrong he was . Tom was not good at subterfuge , he had no secrets ; no one would ever offer him work as one of the queen 's agents . The only way he knew to get answers was to ask outright . " What happened to you last night ? " he said . " Good evening , " Christopher said pleasantly , going to get some supper and a cup of wine . When he came back he said , " This is my friend Will Ryder . Will , this is Tom Nashe. " 122 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Good evening , " Tom said . " Where did you go last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting and looking up at him . " Nowhere . " Not for the first time Tom thought he would never be able to describe Christopher 's expression to his own satisfaction : it was a strange combination of curiosity , arrogance and innocence . And now , watching him , he saw that the other man held the meat he ate with his left hand . That would explain five years of smudged and illegible correspondence , he thought ; odd that he had never noticed it before . Kit used the same hand as the devil . It suits him , Tom thought . " Do you take me for a fool ? " Tom said . " I followed you . " " Did you ? " " Aye , I did . I saw the land Arthur led us to , the trees and the meadow , the women sitting by the stream ? " " Tom , " Christopher said , holding up his hand . The man beside him , Will Ryder , looked amused . " I went nowhere last night . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much like your last tale , the one about goblins wandering the streets of London . Let 's have a new song , at least . " " Listen , " Tom said , furious . " I know what I saw . I saw a strange land , and a path through a wood , and then ? " " You have a good imagination , I 'll give you that . Best save it for the stage . " " Did I imagine this , then ? " Tom held out the flower the dark woman had given him . It had not lost any of its color since the day before . " Nay , I suppose not . " " She gave me this . And when I took it I found myself here , in the tavern . Look  --  it has n't faded at all since then . " " Since yesterday . " Christopher did not trouble to hide the doubt in his voice . " Aye . " " This is arrant superstition . You ? " " Superstition ! " Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his friend . " You 're a man who thinks religion , the proper worship of God , is superstition . You 've closed  | yourself off to any possibility of the miraculous . It 's no wonder you saw nothing last night . " No one said anything for a long moment . Tom thought he might have gone too far . He had n't meant to become angry , had intended only to ask his friend a few questions . The buzz of conversation in the tavern had not diminished ; thank God , he thought , no one had overheard them . Will Ryder spoke into the silence . " My father , " he said , " thinks God sends plagues to punish unbelievers . " Christopher looked at the other man . " Do you blame me for the plague , then ? " " Nay . Nay , but I thought  --  well , I thought that if he was right , then  --  then you might reconsider . If your life depended on it . " " Ah . But if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? do n't you think that he would know that ? Do n't you think he would regard my sudden conversion with suspicion , realizing that I did it only to save my life ? If , of course , there is a God . " lie looked pleased with the paradox . " Then you truly do n't believe in God , " Will said . Tom winced ; this was not the place for such discussions . But Will did not seem disapproving , as Robert Greene had , but genuinely interested . Tom thought that this man , unlike Greene , would take his friends as he found them . " Nay , " Christopher said . " Nor in these  --  these goblins ? Not even when you saw them yourself ? " Tom looked at Will sharply . " What do you mean ? " Christopher said . " Those strangely shaped men you told me about a week ago , " Will said . " Who were they ? " " What strangely shaped men ? " Tom asked . " Whoever they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They told me they had come to petition the queen . " " Did they ? " Will said . " Then why is it no one at court has heard of them , not even the queen ? " " Why ? Probably because they were part of the conspiracy against her . Did you expect them to come forward and explain their business , like the Chorus in a play ? " 124 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " What conspiracy ? " Tom asked . Christopher and Will fell silent . Tom , feeling desperately that they would not tell him anything , began to pour out his questions all at once . " Does it have to do with Arthur ? Why are you so interested in him ? Why did you follow him last night ? " Christopher pushed his hair back from his face and took a bite of mutton before he answered . " Because he told us he was a king , " he said . " But what business is that of yours ? " Christopher shrugged . " None , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the queen ? " Will seemed about to say something . Christopher looked at him and he subsided . Then , " Oh , why not ? " he said . " Aye , we 'll let everyone in London in on the secret  --  we 'll all be conspirators together . You heard , of course , that someone tried to kill the queen yesterday . " " Aye , " Tom said . " But the assassin shot an actor dressed to look like her instead . " His friend looked a little surprised , and Tom grinned . He might not be an agent of the queen , but he had his own ways of gathering information . " Will and I were there , " Christopher said , surprising Tom in turn . " Queen Elizabeth had apparently thought it amusing to trade places with an actor in a masque . The thought saved her life . The actor was killed and the man who shot her captured , but he refuses to name his accomplices . " " But surely he ca n't remain silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've tortured him . He 's said nothing . But the odd thing  --  one of several odd things , really  --  is that he seemed to expect the audience to rise up against the queen . He had no idea how much her subjects love her . " " And the other odd things ? " " Arthur was on the stage with him . The assassin brought him out and introduced him as the new king . I do n't know if the plot was Arthur 's idea ? " " Arthur ? He would n't ? " " Would n't he ? Well , perhaps not . Then he was used by these other men , who intended to put him on the throne but control him the way they might control a puppet . "  | " How do you know there are other men involved ? Perhaps the assassin was acting alone . " Christopher ran his hand through his hair again . His friend had been forthcoming so far , Tom thought ; he had been surprised at how much Kit was willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he start to dissemble ? " It 's complicated , " Christopher said finally . " I saw a man die over this . Believe me , there are others involved , and next time they may succeed in killing the queen . So you see how important it is to find Arthur . " Tom nodded . " Now that you know , " Will said , " will you help us ? " " Of course , " Tom said , surprised . No matter how open Kit became he would never in his life think to ask for help . He began to warm to this man . " Of course I will . What can I do ? " " Tell us if you see Arthur , " Will said . " Try to keep him in sight if he comes back to the tavern . " He has the most extraordinary smile , Tom thought . " Aye , " he said . " But I fear he 's gone to this new land  --  that he 's beyond our finding him . " Christopher returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought over what he had said , feeling faintly surprised that he had told Tom as much as he had . He wondered why he had done so . Did he think he had to match Will 's openness with his own ? But Will had been right : Tom might prove useful . Always assuming , of course , that Tom stayed in this world and did not follow his fancies to Lubberland , or wherever he thought he had been . Still , he was glad that he had not mentioned Robert Poley . It was important that no one know the name of the man who had engaged him , and especially important that Will not discover it . Will might tell his brother Geoffrey , and Geoffrey  --  Geoffrey knew something he should n't , of that Christopher felt certain . People were still awake at the palace , standing and talking in low voices . Candles guttered in iron coronas . He heard his name called by several people , all courtiers he barely knew . There had been fresh gossip since the drama of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken and anxious to share what they heard . Sir Francis Walsingham , the queen 's Principal Secretary , was dead . Fortunately for him , he had been told nothing about the danger the queen had faced and so had died peacefully . Walsingham dead , Christopher thought as he went up the stairs to his room . He was too tired to take it in . But the confusion at court meant that he would not be expected to do any work for a few days ; he could find a quiet place and think about what he had learned . The next day he made his way to the gallery and sat on one of the cushioned benches overlooking the courtyard . Morning light came in through the leaded windows , illuminating each of the courtiers passing in colors as bright as an old manuscript . Did Walsingham 's death mean that his work here was finished ? He knew almost nothing about Poley 's arrangements with the Principal Secretary . But if he discovered the plotters he would certainly be kept on , gratefully rewarded by whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work quickly , though , before someone newly come to power decided he was un-necessary . Well , then , what did he know ? A man had shot someone he believed to be the queen , an assassin who acted for a group of conspirators . Or did he ? What if Tom , of all people , had been right , what if the man had acted on his own behalf ? What evidence did he have for a conspiracy , after all , besides the fact that Poley had told him there was one ? Of course there was the note he had seen in the Black Boar , and a note implied traffic between two people at least . " All is in readiness , " it had said . " Our king awaits . " But it had been Poley who had shown him the note . Nay , that was ridiculous . Why would Poley fabricate a conspiracy ? To make himself more useful to the Principal Secretary ? The queen faced enough dangers , as he had seen , without having to invent any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken part in it ? The odd folks he had seen his first morning at court had almost certainly had something to do with it . But where were they ? He had not p 127 seen them since he had followed one of them to that strange meeting . He had gone by their room several times , but they seemed to have left the palace for good . And , as Will had said , no one at court had ever heard of them . There was always Geoffrey . But Geoffrey had done nothing wrong ; his only crime had been to quote Chaucer , and any son of Canterbury could do the same . It was hardly an indictable offense . And what of Will ? If Geoffrey had a part in this would n't his brother be guilty as well ? Christopher could hardly imagine Will in the shadowy world of intrigue ; his straightforward nature would almost certainly prevent it . Yet Will had told him that he worked for Essex . And did he ? Nay , he was starting to suspect everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thinking Philip Potter guilty . He looked out the window at the statue in the courtyard . Mercury , the god of trickery . He stood and went back to the central stairway . A number of people headed toward the Presence Chamber and he followed , fully expecting to be turned back at the door . But the queen 's guards , as subject to the confusion in the court as everyone else , let him through without a word . The stage from the masque was still there , and the wheeled castle ; probably no one had had time to take them away . A few of the queen 's councilors and their secretaries sat behind a table on the stage and were calling men up one by one to question them . Christopher took a bench at the back . He saw that the courtiers were being made to state where they had been on the night of the masque , and he wondered what good that would do . If the assassin had acted on the orders of a group then that group had probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a while , though , he understood what the queen 's councilors had in mind . The conspirators would not have been in the palace but out in the streets , waiting for the signal to rouse the populace in revolt . Anyone who had n't been at the masque , therefore , would be suspect . 128 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Sir Philip Potter came up to testify . " Aye , I went to the masque , " he said . " I was there with my secretary . " " What is your secretary 's name ? " " His name , " Potter said , looking about him as though the Presence Chamber held clues to the answer . " I know it  --  nay , do n't tell me ? " Christopher winced . A few people laughed . " We 'll summon your secretary , then , " a councilor said , and someone at his elbow made a note . " Here  --  I 'll tell you what it was about , " Potter said . " That 'll prove I was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the councilor said dryly . Potter , seeming not to have heard him , began to describe the seven dancers and explain what they represented . " We thank you , " the councilor said , interrupting him . " You may go now . " Potter left . Christopher did not volunteer to come forward . He knew that Sir Philip was innocent , and he was far more interested in hearing what everyone else had to say . Another courtier climbed to the stage . Christopher recognized him as one of the people who had gathered at the foot of the stairs , watching and laughing while Potter played the fool . " Were you at the masque two days ago , my lord ? " the councilor asked . " Nay , my lord . " The crowd murmured . " Where were you , then ? " " At a dinner with some friends . " " Which friends were these ? " " Nicholas Russell , John Stafford , Richard Dyer , Edward White , " the courtier said . The councilor 's secretary hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutton . Then we discussed the weather , as I remember . It was fine for April . " Christopher looked up sharply , understanding everything . The strange circle of men he had overheard had been rehearsing what they would say if their conspiracy failed . They had written an entire play that would prove them to have been elsewhere at the time . " Very well , " the councilor said . " We will summon your friends . " The secretary made a note . * * * p 129 Though Potter could not remember his secretary 's name it seemed that the queen 's councilors knew men with better memories . A man dressed in the livery of the queen came to summon Christopher to the Presence Chamber the next day . He went with him eagerly . The conspirators he had overheard would be there , and he was anxious to see them . At the chamber he sat on one of the benches and looked around him . The man who had testified yesterday sat a few rows back , but Christopher could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had they decided that their careful scheme would not stand up to the scrutiny of the queen 's councilors ? A secretary called his name and he went up to testify . He agreed that he was Sir Philip Potter 's secretary , and that he had been with Potter at the masque . The councilors , satisfied , let him go . He returned to the back of the room , hoping no one would ask him to leave now that his business was done . The conspirators had still not arrived . The councilors questioned another of the courtiers , and then a secretary called out the names Christopher had waited for . " Nicholas Russell , John Stafford , Richard Dyer , Edward White ! " What ordinary names they had proved to have , after all , these strange men who had plotted to overthrow the queen . Christopher looked around him . To his great surprise a body of men had risen and were heading toward the stage . He had never seen them before in his life .  | Alice 's first thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as the talk around her grew louder , as more and more people turned to look at her , she started to feel ashamed . She had done nothing immoral , she knew ; the only man she had ever bedded had been John , and after his death she had lived chastely . Nevertheless the feeling , irrational as it was , began to grow . The stationers turned back to George . The set expressions of one or two of them , their pursed mouths and narrow eyes , made her wonder if they had already made up their minds and were only waiting to hear what George would say next . Even if she could prove her innocence , how could she face them tomorrow in the churchyard ? She felt the blood heating her face , and her heart began to beat loudly . George waited until he had everyone 's attention . " We have all seen this woman with a certain Mistress Margery , " he said . " A cunning woman , a dealer in the forbidden arts . A witch , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , Mistress Alice neglecting her work as she and her friend planned certain rituals . I do n't need to tell you what those rituals were .

" Alice said , angered and horrified as much by George 's calm tone as by what he was saying . " Silence , " the Master of the Company said . " You 'll have your turn to speak when he finishes . " She wondered if she would . Although George did not go to plays she knew that most of the company did , and she had heard talk about Dr. Faustus , the story of the man who had bargained with the devil . They were ready to believe impossible stories , tales of necromancy and evil , and perhaps would not stay to hear her answer . And truly , would her account be any less fantastical ?

The privy councilors had been interested in getting at the truth ; now she thought that the Stationers ' Company might be fascinated by George 's lies . " Not true ? " George said . He addressed the crowd instead of her , as if her words had no importance . " But she admitted to certain revels , as she called them , that she attended . Attended with her friend , the witch Margery . And it was at these ceremonies that she acquired her familiar . " At this a shiver of apprehension passed through the room . " I have seen it myself , " George said calmly . " It is the size of a man , and covered with fur . It has horns and cloven hoofs and a tail , and it lives with her , curled up by her hearth . What they do together is not a fit matter for discussion here , but I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " George went on , and Alice stared ; she would have wagered that George had never heard of Agrippa in his life . Who had he been talking to ? " Cornelius Agrippa says " ? here he consulted a piece of paper in his hand ? " ' Because women be more desirous of secrets and inclined to superstitions , and be more easily beguiled , therefore they ' ? Agrippa means the devils  --  therefore they sooner appear to them , and do great miracles . ' Do you see what I mean ?

Her rottenness can spread throughout the company , corrupting everyone it touches . " No one spoke as he returned to his seat . Alice , who had been planning to rise in her own defense , now felt shame overwhelm her so strongly that she could barely move . She wanted only to get away from the hall and the rest of the stationers , to start over at another trade in another city . She knew she could never face any of these people again .

" A few people laughed . George , unmoved , said from his seat , " Can you prove that she does not have a familiar ? As I said , I have seen it . It does her work for her , her household chores . It was washing a pot when I visited . " Some of the stationers murmured among themselves . Blount said nothing . He could not answer , Alice thought bleakly , because he had never been to her house . None of them had except George , because visiting an unmarried woman was con-  | sidered immoral . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he alone had been favored with an invitation because she had hoped to renew their friendship . But Blount 's defense had given her courage .

" You are all welcome to my house to see for yourself . " George laughed harshly . " Will you trust this woman ? " he asked . " A demon can become the size of an acorn , if it so desires . Aye , I 'm certain we will find no familiar in her house . " " I wonder that you talk so easily about morality , " Blount said . " We have all seen you in conversation with a man who comes into the churchyard , a man asking questions about Mistress Wood 's son . He is a counterfeiter , they say , and I have also heard that he dabbles in alchemy . " " He is a scientist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spirit world . " " Can you prove that ? " Blount said . " Master Cowper 's morals are not in question here , " the master said . " Mistress Wood has yet to reply to his accusations . " Alice stood as Blount moved back to his seat . " I can only say that almost everything Master Cowper had said is false , " she said , gratified to hear that her voice sounded strong and certain now . " I have a friend named Margery , but she is no witch . I have never consorted with devils . I have no familiar ? " " You lie ! " George said , his calm finally leaving him . " I 've seen it myself .

" " I did not want to call her honor into question . But now that she 's in danger of losing her membership I think my testimony can only help her . " " I do n't believe you , " George said . " I 've never seen the two of you talk together . " " Believe it as you like . It 's true . " " And it 's still my word against yours . " " And against Edward Blount 's . And most importantly , against Alice Wood 's . But come , how many people in this company truly believe that this woman , someone you have all known for years , someone you have worked with these past months , is a p 135 witch ? Have any of you seen her muttering charms ? Have your books become rotten with mold when she passes by ? " A few people were laughing now . " She 's a witch ! " George said angrily . " I tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon ? " James said . A few members of the company shook their heads . " I have heard a rumor , which I would hesitate to pass along in other circumstances , that Master Cowper asked for Mistress Wood 's hand in marriage . And that she refused him . Can this accusation be caused by hurt pride , by a desire for revenge ? " " That 's not true ! " George said . " I would n't have her . She 's immoral , evil . " " And how moral is it to lie ? " Alice said . " You asked me to marry you , that day in the cookshop . " " You can prove nothing , " George said . " Ah , " Walter James said . " As our esteemed master said , we are not here to prove anything but that Mistress Wood is innocent of these ridiculous charges . Does the company still want to take a vote ? " A few people nodded . But the panic George had tried to cause diminished , lulled away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around them , puzzled , as if escaping from a long and evil dream . " I demand a vote , " George said . " Aye , we should have a vote , if only to lay this matter to rest once and for all , " James said . He nodded to the master . " All in favor , " the master said , " say aye . " Only three or four people came out for Alice 's dismissal . " All opposed ? " the master said . James and Blount said " Nay ! " immediately and loudly . A few of the others joined in , quieter , and then a few more . The nays swept through the room like a wave . But still no one would look at her . The master ended the meeting . Some of the members turned and smiled at her then , and a few of them came over to wish her good day . But no one said anything about the victory she had won . Perhaps they were all embarrassed about the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to leave by the time Walter James made his way over to her . " I want to thank you , " she said . " I do n't  --  I do n't know ? " " There 's no need , " he said . " But why did you ? " He raised his hand to silence her . " This is not the place to speak of it , " he said , so softly no one heard him . Then , louder , he said , " After the fright you received today I think you should see a play . Will you come with me ? " Should she ? Other stationers might be able to close their stalls and take holidays , but she needed the trade each day brought . And he must need it too ; he had n't been at the churchyard very long . " Come , " he said as if reading her thoughts . " One day wo n't matter so very much . " First Brownie and now this man : folks were always telling her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not ? She had n't known much joy since John died . " With pleasure , " she said . He held out his hand and she took it . When she got outside she found her knees would almost not hold her . Now that her shame had gone she felt terror more than anything else , and a nearly insupportable anger . They had wanted to burn her at the stake . To burn her ! It would be ridiculous if it were n't so frightening . " Are you well enough to walk ? " Walter asked . She nodded , drawing a deep breath to get her strength back . But it was a long way to Shoreditch , outside the city walls , where the Theatre and the Curtain stood . They went along Cheapside , through the crowded market stalls and goldsmiths ' shops . She stopped to stare , amazed , at the intricately-worked gold and silver saltcellars and ewers and spoons displayed in the windows . " What would you like to see ? " Walter asked . She had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and John had not gone out very much , and George had thought plays immoral . She tried to remember titles she had seen on the playbills she printed but they all blurred together , stories of love  | and war and blood and revenge . She would cheerfully see any one of them . A coach came toward them , taking up most of the narrow street , and they moved to make room for it . Its wheels creaked ; the horses ' hooves fell loudly on the cobblestones . She waited until it had passed before she said , " I do n't know . You choose . " Dr. Faustus is very good , " he said , and then , " Oh . I 'm sorry . " " Nay , do n't be . " " The Battle of Alcazar , then . Or Orlando Furioso . I 've heard talk of both . " " Nay , let 's see Faustus . Everyone in the churchyard has been to it . I want to know what all the talk is about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she nodded . " Very well . " The walk was restoring her perspective , her equanimity . She was not a witch . They were fools to think so . How could she have thought of leaving the company ? She would stay , and show them the extent of their folly . They walked in silence for a while , passing the huge courtyard of the Royal Exchange on their left . Alice saw merchants from all over Europe , dressed in outlandish clothes , crossing the courtyard or hurrying through the pillared arcade . She had a quick sense of vast excitement , as if whole destinies were decided here . It reminded her of something she had forgotten , that London was bigger , and contained stranger sights , than the churchyard of St. Paul 's . They turned left onto Gracechurch Street . " Why did you come to my defense ? " she asked . " How could I not ? " The simple answer warmed her , but it explained nothing . " But you lied for me , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George is an ass . Any fool could see that he hoped to gain something if you lost your membership in the company . And no one who knows you could believe the things he said for a moment . Even I did n't believe it , and I had only met you once . So my conscience is quite clear . If I had n't spoken up you might have been in some danger . I have seen crowds like that become 138 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | enraged in a moment , flaring up like fire on a thatched roof . " " You said George hoped to gain something . What do you think it is ? " He looked at her shrewdly . " I do n't know . I would guess it has something to do with that man they talked about , the counterfeiter . " She had been surprised to hear , at the Stationers ' Hall , that George had befriended the man in black . Now she wondered if he might also be looking for Arthur , if he worked for Queen Oriana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your son , " Walter James said , looking at her shrewdly . She said nothing . The man beside her seemed pleasant , and he had come to her rescue when she had most needed it , but she did n't think she knew enough to confide in him . What if it had all been a trick , if he and George had plotted together to get her to trust him ? But nay , she was starting to suspect everyone . Surely Walter would n't have defended her so strongly if he had been George 's friend . " How long has your son been missing ? " " Some years now . " " Do you know where he went ? Or why folks are looking for him ? " " Nay . " She was unused to lying , so she had n't known what she was going to say until the word was out of her mouth . Thinking it over , though , she realized she had made the right decision . He would n't believe her story , for one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her troubles . And if , unlikely as it seemed , he and George did work for the same forces , she would be glad she had said nothing . They went through Bishopsgate and past the small houses and fields of the suburbs . He was silent until they reached the playhouses , as if he understood he had trespassed too much on her privacy . They came to the Theatre just as the trumpets sounded from the roof to announce the start of the play . They hurried inside . It cost a penny to stand , twopence to sit , and three to sit on cushions . He paid sixpence for both of them p 139 and directed her to a row of benches . She sat and looked around her . The theater was circular , with the stage projecting out into the center and surrounded on three sides by the audience . Near the stage , almost on it , sat the gallants who had come to see and be seen , and who would comment loudly , not on the action on stage but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing . Men and women moved up and down the benches near her , selling apples , nuts , bottled ale , tobacco . Next to her a man was talking loudly to his companion , a woman who smelled overwhelmingly of perfume , about his wife . The man did not stop talking , and the vendors did not stop hawking their wares , when an actor dressed in black velvet came out to speak the prologue . The city apprentices in their blue coats and flat caps , escaped from work for a day , cheered the beginning of the play enthusiastically , and she missed the opening lines . When she began to be able to hear she was surprised at how much plays had changed since she and John had gone to see them . The actors no longer spoke in rhyme , but the lines , held together now only by meter , retained all of their poetry and integrity . And soon she found that she preferred blank verse , that she had n't realized how intrusive the constant rhyme had been . The actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement she had never heard before . She watched , fascinated and a little horrified , as Faustus drew his circle and conjured up Mephostophilis , as he made the bargain with the devil that was to cost him so much , as he traveled all over the world with his new powers . She barely noticed the noise of the crowd , the gallants standing in a body and leaving , the two men in front of her who had started to play cards . The day grew hot , and the smells of roasted nuts and sweat and perfume rose around her . She was aware that , once or twice , Walter glanced over in her direction . She thought he might still be worried that this demonstration of witchcraft would prove too much for her . But though the devils on stage frightened her she managed to show Walter nothing of what she felt until the end , Faustus 's last 140 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | terrified speech . The crowd was finally silent ; they heard the stately iambics broken now as Faustus stammered out new bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming damnation : " Adders and serpents , let me breathe awhile . Ugly hell , gape not , come not , Lucifer ! I 'll burn my books  --  ah , Mephostophilis ! " Then it was over , and she turned to see Walter sitting next to her , looking as pale as she herself must be . They stood and pushed with the rest of the crowd to the exits . Walter kept up a steady stream of talk on the way home , as if he realized that she had been shaken more than she would like to admit . " The man who wrote the play  --  I 've seen him in the churchyard , " he said . " He comes to talk to Edward Blount . Ned wants to publish a poem of his . " She had met Marlowe once , and she told him about that , and about his friend Thomas Nashe . It was so easy to be with Walter that she felt herself forgetting her cares , George 's strange attack and her missing son . They walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door . " I 'd ask you in , if only to make sure I have no familiar , " she said , " but it 's been a long day and I 'm tired . Thanks for every-thing . " " I 'll see you tomorrow , " he said . She sat in the kitchen for a long time after he had gone . Despite what she had told him she felt awake , alert , too excited to go to bed . She went over everything that had happened that day  --  George 's speech and Edward 's defense , and Walter 's , and the play , the crowds of people , the way Walter had looked after her . . . Walter . Why could n't she get him out of her mind ? Was she so lonely , then , so pathetic , that the simplest kindness from a stranger could unbalance her completely ? And surely kindness was all that it had been ; he had n't expected anything more . She had made the same mistake before with George ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into some- p 141 thing larger , a friendship that had not been returned . The world was full of traps for lonely old women . Was she in love with him then ? Nay  --  he was not the sort of man she could care for . She understood why she had fallen in love with John , who had made her laugh , who had had plans which took in more of the world than their tiny community , who had been handsome and strong . When she thought of Walter she could find nothing attractive about him : he was too short , too dark , his eyes too close together and his chin too large . Yet she knew she would think of him all night . She wanted only to be with him , to listen to his light friendly voice as he talked about inconsequential things . She wished she had thought to invite him in . How could she face him the next day in the churchyard ? She could only think that she must not betray to him what she felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to make herself a light supper . Something white on the sideboard caught her attention , a piece of paper . " Come tomorrow , " the note said in Margery 's handwriting . " The Fair Folk are moving . They have decided not to wait for your son . "  | Christopher watched in astonishment as the four men made their way toward the stage . If these people were the conspirators then who were the odd folks he had met in the room that early morning ? " Aye , we had dinner together that afternoon , " one of the men said . " My wife was there as well . " As he listened to them speak Christopher recognized their voices ; they were indeed the men he had overheard rehearsing the play . He had been led astray , had decided that these folks were the same as the lunatics he had visited because a man from one group had belonged to the other as well . The truth had proved to be less fantastic than he had thought ; the conspirators were ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He had complicated things needlessly , like Robert Poley , or worse , like Tom Nashe with his goblins . One of the councilors nodded and dismissed the four men , and they stepped off the stage . Their story had been accepted ; they would not be asked any further questions . He alone of all the people in the room knew that these men had plotted to bring down the queen , and he could prove nothing against them .  | An idea came to him then , a way he could demonstrate their guilt . He studied the conspirators ' faces carefully and returned to his room , wondering if Philip Potter could be made to memorize a few lines . The next day he spoke to the queen 's guards and then went to dinner with Potter in the Great Hall . The conspirators ' standing at court was slightly higher than Potter 's , and so in the usual course of things Sir Philip would not have found seats next to them . But he and Christopher had followed the men closely into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . Christopher ignored the men 's hostile looks , and Potter did not seem to notice them at all . When the men turned away Christopher studied them carefully . Nicholas Russell , John Stafford , Richard Dyer , Edward White : he had paid enough attention when they testified to know which was which . And their leader , who had said his name was John Bridges . Drums and trumpets sounded , and then the nobility and Knights of the Garter came into the room , followed by Queen Elizabeth and her maids-of-honor . In all the time Christopher had been at the palace he had never seen the queen at dinner ; she had the habit of dining privately . He had heard , though , that she wanted to show herself to the court ; rumor had it that she was dead , with an impostor on the throne . The queen sat at a raised dais at the far end of the room , her councilors to either side of her . More trumpets played , and the Yeomen of the Guard , each dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in her dinner . A woman Christopher knew to be a countess served one of the guards a portion of every dish , and after the guard had tasted the food the queen began to eat . Only then did servants pass through the hall with dishes of pork , capon , beef , and venison pie . A consort played a galliard in another room . Nearly a week after the masque the subject of conversation at every table was the same : the assassination attempt and the capture of the man who had tried to shoot the queen . " I hear , " 144 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | someone at another table said , " that the assassin has died . Succumbed to torture , no doubt . " The comment had been loud enough for the conspirators to overhear . But none of them seemed particularly sad that one of their number had died , or relieved that the man had not lived to betray them . For the first time Christopher wondered if he had made a mistake . But these men were consummate actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hiding what they felt . " I wonder if the assassin spoke at all before he died , " he said . The men paid no attention to him . Clearly they , like Will , could tell that he was no gentleman , but unlike Will they seemed to want to keep their distance from one so lowborn . Or could there be another reason for their silence ? " If he said nothing his friends will go unpunished , " Sir Philip said . " Who are they , I wonder ? They could be anyone , anyone in this room . " Christopher felt a vast relief . Sir Philip had not forgotten his lines . He watched with amusement as Potter added a touch of his own to the drama Christopher had constructed : he turned and surveyed the room , frowning at the thought that such evil might be present . Well , Sir Philip was not stupid , though there seemed to be a great many things no one had ever told him . He had understood the masque , after all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Christopher said . " Do you remember the note that was delivered to my room by accident ? " " Aye , " Sir Philip said , as naturally as if there had truly been such a note . The other men at the table continued to eat , but Christopher thought he saw a few of them tense , listening for his next words . John Bridges turned slightly to be able to hear him . " I think the note had something to do with the conspiracy , " Christopher said . " I did n't understand it at all when I read it  --  something about an imaginary dinner in April , and one or two lines about the need for secrecy . The last sentence mentioned a new king , that much I do remember . " p 145 " For God 's sake , man , who was it from ? " Sir Philip asked eagerly . Christopher thought he might be overdoing it a little . " Who was it addressed to ? " " All the names were in cipher . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if I took it to them . " " Aye , you should do that , by all means , " Sir Philip said . The plotters had abandoned all pretense of eating . One or two of them stared frankly at Christopher as if trying to memorize his features . " I will , " Christopher said , biting into the venison pie . It was very good . " I 'll do it this afternoon . " After dinner he and Potter went up the stairs to Potter 's room . Christopher sat at the writing table but Sir Philip paced the room anxiously , opening and closing the door again and again to see if the queen 's guards had come . " Where are they ? " he said . " What if they did n't believe you ? " " They 'll be here , " Christopher said , sounding more certain than he felt . They had certainly seemed to believe his story that morning . He found himself more worried about where the conspirators were ; he had expected them to confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir Philip closed the door and paced the length of the room again . " Will this be dangerous ? " " Not for you , " Christopher said , hoping to reassure him . " I 'm the one who has the note , after all . I 've told you  --  you do n't have to stay . " " And I 've told you that I want to be here , " Potter said . " I have to prove myself to the queen . " Christopher realized that he had misunderstood the man . Potter did not fear danger but looked forward to it , hoping to demonstrate his loyalty and cleverness to the queen . Suddenly Christopher felt very old , older than Sir Philip though the man was at least forty . What would it be like to be so innocent ? Someone knocked on the door . Christopher stood . Sir Philip turned , flustered , and ran his hands over his trunk hose . The men entered without waiting for permission . " Give us the note , " Nicholas Russell said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher said . What had happened to the queen 's guard ? " Aye . Do n't play the fool . The note you talked about at dinner . Where is it ? " " I  --  I gave it to one of the queen 's councilors . " " Nay , " John Bridges said . " No tricks . You did n't have time for that . Where is it ? Is it in this room ? " " Why do you want it ? " Sir Philip edged toward the door , moving surprisingly softly for all his plumpness . " And no questions , either . You ! " he said , calling to Sir Philip . Potter stopped halfway to the door . " Stay here . We 'll have to pry the answer out of you , then , the way we might pry an oyster from its shell . And the tool for both tasks is the same  --  the knife . " He motioned to Richard Dyer . Dyer slipped his dagger from its sheath . " We 'll start with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bridges said . Stafford twisted Potter 's arms behind his back . " Did n't you learn anything from your stay at court ? You 're not good at cleverness , Sir Philip  --  leave it to other people . " Richard Dyer brought his dagger up to Sir Philip 's face . Philip 's eyes opened almost comically wide . " Cut one of his cheeks , to begin with , " Bridges said . Philip tried to jerk his head away . Stafford held him tightly . But before Dyer could bring his dagger closer something odd began to happen to the tapestry between the windows ; it bulged outward for a fraction of a second and then tore to shreds . An explosive noise echoed back and forth through the room , and then Dyer fell , holding his side . Two men dressed in the livery of the queen 's guard stepped out from behind the tapestry . One of them held a gun . " We arrest you , in the queen 's name , " he said . The other guard tore Stafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took out his sword , and began motioning to the remaining conspirators , Bridges , Russell , and White . Bridges and White raised their arms away from their  | weapons , but Russell ran for the door . Before anyone could stop him he had slipped outside and was gone . Christopher ran after him . They hurried down the main staircase and into the Great Hall , and then Russell opened a door Christopher had never noticed before . Suddenly Christopher found himself inside a huge kitchen . The strong heat hit him like a fist . A group of men at the hearth were turning a goat on a spit . Russell shoved past them . Christopher followed , his elbow jostling the goat 's stiff outstretched legs . " What ? " the cooks shouted after them . " Stop ! " Russell ran through another door and down a dimly lit stone corridor . He opened one final door and they stepped outside . Ahead of them was the hedge maze . Russell ran through the ornamental entrance . Christopher followed . Russell turned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took both corners after him and looked around quickly , seeing nothing before him but headhigh walls of leafy green . Russell had vanished . He stood still a moment , listening for the other man . A noise came from the right . He followed it and heard the same noise , coming from his left this time . Was that Russell or someone else ? But who else would be in the maze ? He hurried on . After a few turns he realized he was lost . Russell was long gone . He looked around him , trying desperately to remember the way out . Left here , or was it right ? It had all looked different from the window in his room , more orderly somehow . He passed a stone bench , a statue . Where was he ? He began to turn corners at random  --  was that the same bench , the same statue ? He could n't remember . He slowed . It seemed that he had spent his entire life surrounded by these dreadful hedges , that he would never see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . A branch snapped somewhere . The air around him seemed to thicken . He could not concentrate . He forced his way along a path until it ended , and then  | turned right . Ahead of him , at a fork in the path , he saw the same statue he had seen three turns back . Suddenly it moved . It was not a statue at all , he saw , but a small man , maybe one of the men he had seen his first morning in the palace . The man pointed left . He had the oddest smile on his face , almost as if he had proven some sort of point , though what it was Christopher could not imagine . He wore a circlet of green leaves in his hair . Christopher went left . The path turned again . Someone moved on the other side of the hedge , and for a terrible moment he thought that it was the little man again , come back to plague him with false directions . Then he looked through the leaves and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking lost . He began to head back . Christopher dropped behind a corner , waiting for him . Could he overpower the other man ? Russell did not seem to be aware of him ; perhaps he could take him by surprise . He tensed , anticipating the moment when Russell would come into sight . Several seconds passed . Where was he ? Christopher moved carefully around the corner . At first he could not take in what he saw . The little man stood over Russell , tying his hands behind him with what looked like supple branches . He sang as he worked ; Christopher could not imagine how he had failed to hear it before . The man looked up and smiled . His eyes were as green as the leaves around him . He tied one final knot . Before Christopher could say anything the man turned and , more quickly than seemed possible , slipped away from him around a corner . " Wait ! " Christopher called . He took the corner after him , feeling clumsy next to the other man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight line in front of him , but the little man was nowhere to be seen . He went back to Russell . The conspirator was unconscious , breathing shallowly . The other man could wait ; he had to get Russell outside the maze somehow , back to the queen 's guard . Looking up he saw a dying hedge , the roots exposed and withered . He lifted Russell to his feet and broke through the  | hedge , then  --  he was past caring  --  tore through another wall , this one whole . The afternoon light , unfiltered by green , nearly blinded him for a moment . He had made his way out of the maze , and , incredibly , had found himself fairly close to the palace . He set down his burden with relief and went off to find one of the guard . Once again the Presence Chamber was crowded with people . ( : hristopher and Will sat near the front and watched as Queen Elizabeth thanked Sir Philip for the service he had done to the state . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal risk and undeterred by threats to his person , discovered and exposed a Catholic conspiracy aimed at taking our life and sowing disorder in the land , " the queen said . " It was my pleasure , Your Majesty , " Sir Philip said , rising awkwardly from his bow . He seemed more reserved than usual , and Christopher wondered if Potter suspected this Queen Elizabeth to be an impostor as well . No one would say anything about it during the ceremony , but everyone at court knew that Sir Philip had received his tax monopoly , and a gift of some land as well . There had been a certain amount of carping and ill-mannered jesting at this news , but none of the courtiers could say that Sir Philip did not deserve his good fortune . Potter , displaying the same flustered ignorance he had shown from the beginning , did not seem to notice the insults , and looked at everyone he met with the same expression of surprised joy . Finally the ceremony ended . " The air 's too close in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk outside . " Christopher showed Will the way he had taken following Russell : through the Great Hall , into the kitchen and finally down the corridor that led out-of-doors . " I 've never seen this , in all the years I 've been at court , " Will said . " How did you discover it ? " Christopher said nothing . The hedge maze had a gaping hole in it , he noticed . 150 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " I heard you had something to do with the capture of these conspirators , " Will said . The man was as innocent as Potter sometimes , Christopher thought . He looked around him carefully , making certain they could not be overheard . " Aye , " he said . " But if folks should hear of it they 'll guess that I was something more than Sir Philip 's secretary . I wo n't be sent out on any errands again . Have you passed on this rumor to anyone else ? " " Nay , I wo n't . " He did n't , Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be helped if he had spoken to anyone . They began to walk through the formal plots of the queen 's garden . " The queen said these men were Catholic conspirators , " Will said . " What could they have wanted with Arthur ? Or was he Catholic as well ? " " Nay , I doubt it . They wanted him because some people in London were willing to follow him , and were eager to see him as a king . Once he took the throne they would have been careful to keep any real power from him . " " But what about those strange men you saw ? Did n't they have something to do with Arthur as well ? " Aye , probably they had , he thought . What had happened to the little man he had followed to the conspirators ' meeting ? And what about the man he had overheard at the meeting , the one who had sounded so familiar ? Christopher had heard the voices of all the conspirators and was certain this man had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was it who had helped him in the maze ? And why had Geoffrey quoted the same line of poetry as one of the conspirators ? He had never told Will any of this , though , and he did not intend to start now . Will would laugh and start to talk about goblins again , and he was as tired of the subject as he had been when Tom had mentioned it . His task here had ended ; he had discovered the conspirators and would be well paid for it , and then he would go home . To imagine that the supernatural had anything to do with it was folly . " What must that be like , I wonder ? " Will said . p 151 He had been so deep in thought he had n't heard the beginning of Will 's question . " What must what be like ? " " Believing in something so strongly that you 're willing to give your life for it , the way these men believed in the Catholic cause . " " Do n't expect me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to choose between one religion and another . They could just as easily have become Mohammedan . " He expected Will to object , the way Robin and Tom did when he made some statement they considered outrageous . But Will would not be drawn into a debate . " What will you do now ? " he asked . " Go home . Work on my play . " " Do you write plays ? And poetry as well ? " Christopher nodded . " Good , " Will said . " I 'll be your patron when I come into my inheritance . I 've always wanted to be a patron . " Christopher laughed . " How do you know they 're any good ? " " I do n't , really . I do n't know anything at all about poetry . You 'll have to teach me  --  you seem to know something about everything . " Then , to Christopher 's great astonishment and delight , he drew him close and kissed him on the mouth . There remained one final task before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Philip Potter . The next day he visited the man in his rooms , watching as his servants packed up his belongings . There was a great tear in the tapestry between the windows , Christopher saw ; he seemed , all unknowing , to have left a trail of destruction behind him in his short stay at court . " There you are , " Sir Philip said . " I wanted to thank you for all you 've done . You were the one who exposed the plotters , not I  --  do n't think I do n't know that . I tried to tell the queen that ? " " You did n't ! " " Aye , I did . Why should n't I ? You deserved the credit as much as I did . But her councilors said that they would take care of everything . And did they ? " " Aye . " 152 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Good . Well , I 'll miss you . We had some merry times to-gether . " Christopher smiled . Merry was not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing those guards come out from behind the tapestry , " Potter said . " Remember how anxious I was for them to arrive ?

It sounded too implausible ? they thought it was something you and I had invented to revenge ourselves on the court , on these men . " " Revenge ? " Potter said . " Revenge for what ? " His face was as round and guileless as a pocket watch . Christopher sighed . " They wanted to eavesdrop , to see what we would do if we were left alone . " " Nay , you 're too suspicious . I think they wanted to make a grand entrance , like the knights of Order overcoming the vices . And so they did . " He looked around him . " I think I 'm done here . Do n't forget the letter of recommendation I wrote you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Alice had spent the night unable to sleep . Why had she sent Walter away ? Nay  --  why should she want him with her ? What would the Stationers ' Company say if she had spent the night with him ? A woman cleared of charges of immoral living could not give in to her whims so easily . It was good that he had gone . But would n't it be better to have him here ? She could tell him the truth about her son , and he could help her think what to do about Margery 's note . By morning she had decided to go to Margery . The message she had sent had sounded pressing . And by avoiding the churchyard she would be able to avoid Walter , too , to gain one more day in which she could decide what to do about him . It was snowing as she left the house , an unseasonable snow after a winter of mild weather . She went back to get her woolen cloak and continued on to her assistant 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for her that day . Then she walked through the falling snow to Margery 's cottage . As she went up the path to her friend 's house she saw that Margery had built up the fire ; a thin gray thread of smoke drew up from her chimney into the sky . " Come in , come in ! " Margery said , opening the door to her before she could knock . 154 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | After the cold Margery 's house seemed almost hot . The fire sounded loud in the small house . She shook off her cloak with relief . Margery handed her hot cider and pushed a protesting black and white cat off a stool . Alice sat . " You remember Agnes , do n't you ? " Margery said . Alice nodded , trying not to feel annoyed . She had hoped to talk to Margery alone , to ask her pressing questions about her son and Walter . What business did the other woman have here ? It was true she had delivered Arthur twenty years ago  --  but nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterfeit , the boy she had raised , the Prince of Faerie . Did that old tale give this nosy gossip the right to pry into her affairs ? But Agnes 's presence would not stop Alice from telling her news . " I must tell you , " she said . " George has had dealings with the man in black , the one who 's been asking after Arthur . " Margery frowned . " This is ill news indeed . How did you come to learn of it ? " She told Margery the whole story  --  how George had denounced her to the Stationers ' Company , how Edward Blount and Walter James had risen in her defense , how Blount had mentioned the alchemist and counterfeiter who had spoken with George . Margery looked horrified at the charges that had been brought against her , and Alice wondered if someone had once accused her friend of necromancy as well . She realized , not for the first time , how little she actually knew about the other woman . Through it all Agnes watched her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play she had seen with Walter and the sleepless night she had spent afterward . When Agnes was gone she would confide in Margery again . " What can we do ? " Alice asked when she had finished her tale . " If these men are truly counterfeiters perhaps we should tell the authorities , one of the queen 's men . " " Nay . We must not allow information about your son to come to the queen . " " Why ? " ? " Why ? Have n't you heard the news ? There has already been p 155 one plot against the queen . Someone tried to kill her , and I . heard stories that Arthur might have been involved . What ? " " Arthur would n't plot against the queen , " Alice said quickly . but would he ? What did she know about him , after all ? " Maybe not . But Arthur is important to a great many people . imagine what the queen would do if she heard of a man in her kingdom who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use him in some way ? " " Perhaps . But probably she would have him killed , especially if he made claims to the throne . " ' " Then what can we do ? " " Do ? Just now we can do nothing but wait . " Margery lit her pipe and sat back . Why had her friend sent that urgent note if they could do nothing ? Alice wanted to shake her , to force her into action . If the weather cleared she should go back to the churchyard . Why had she come ? " We must wait until evening , " Margery said finally , smoke blowing from her mouth . " There will be a battle tonight , in Finsbury Field . As I said , they have decided not to wait for your son . Did Margery read her thoughts ? " Battle ? But what does that have to do with us ? " " Arthur may be there . We know that he is drawn by these folk , and rightly , since they are his true heritage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt as if she had been stabbed to the heart . Would Margery never stop surprising her ? To see her son , after all these years ... " And what then ? " she asked . " Will they let me speak to him ? " " I do n't know . We can only wait and see . " They spoke of inconsequential things after that . Margery showed Agnes through the small cottage , the books and the crying stone , the herbs that hung in bundles from the ceiling : yarrow , vervain , saxifrage , adder 's tongue , hellebore . They began to talk about illnesses , which herb was best for the cough , and Alice realized that Agnes , as a midwife , must have her own small store of knowledge . She felt irritated , even jealous . Margery had never spoken to her like this about the 156 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | medicines she used . And surely they could spend the time better ; surely they could make some plan , devise some way that she could see her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Oriana and keep him for herself . What would he be like after all these years among the Fair Folk ? No matter  --  he was hers , after all , and not one of them . Finally Margery set out a small supper , cold chicken and leg of mutton . Alice ate hungrily : she had had nothing since breakfast . But Agnes outdid her , eating everything that was put before her , her wide mouth in constant motion . What good will she be tonight ? Alice thought again . Why is she coming with us ? Margery set down food for the cats and the women left the cottage . It was still early , not yet five o'clock . But darkness lay over the streets in front of them , an unnatural blackness caused by the low gray clouds overhead . A light snow still fell . " This mild winter , " Margery said , as they walked through the dirty slush of London 's streets . " I wonder if it was caused by the Fair Folks ' presence here . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding Arthur . " " I wonder , " Agnes said . She had taken an apple from the cottage and was eating it as they went . Their walk took them halfway across London , from Ludgate in the east to Moorgate in the north , a distance of nearly a mile . As they passed Paul 's Alice saw that the stationers had gone home early , and the gallants and lawyers and tailors as well . She had never heard it so quiet . The stores and stalls on Cheapside had closed , and in the smaller streets the houses were unlit , shut tight for the evening . It was almost as if folks anticipated something , as if they knew not to be on the streets this night . Only the waxing moon , shining momentarily through the clouds , showed them their way . At last they came to Finsbury Field . All of them were panting slightly , and Alice nearly laughed . What good did these three old women think they would do tonight ? Alice saw nothing on the field but old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field remained , plain , substantial , unchanging . She looked at her friend , puzzled . " Now we wait , " Margery said .  | The evening grew colder . Alice shivered inside her woolen oak , and Agnes rubbed her arms and stamped her feet to keep arm . How long would they have to wait ? Could Margery be mg , could they have made the long journey for nothing ? She ought of the wearisome walk back to her house and she hed . Her breath showed silver in the air . Margery touched her shoulder . " Look , " she said . Someone oved across the field . Alice closed her eye again , but no light emanated from the an walking toward them . " George , " Margery whispered . Sursed , Alice opened her eye . George came closer . Now she could see that he had three her men with him . " Who are they ? " she whispered . Is that the man in black ? " Margery said . Aye , it was indeed . She marveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark night . But as she started to say so she card Margery hiss , a long breath drawn in between her teeth . ' Paul Hogg , " she said . " Who ? " An evil man . I wonder what his business is here . And who the fourth ? " Paul Hogg motioned to the others at that moment , and they headed toward the three women . Alice pulled her cloak closer around her , trying not to feel afraid . Do n't be foolish , she thought . Margery 's here . But Margery had seemed worried by Hogg as well . " Well , well , " Hogg said . " What brings three old women out n such a cold and desolate night ? Or can it be that you have owhere else to go ? Have your fortunes changed so much since I last met you , Margery ? " " There speaks one who knows all about homeless women , " Margery said , addressing not Hogg but George . " He wo n't have told you , George , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cozener of the innocent , was turning people off their farms . Oh , he was famous for it  --  landlords all over England would seek him out if any of their tenants gave them trouble . " " Aye , and what of it ? " Hogg said , unperturbed . " It 's a liveli-158 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | hood , the same as any other , a service rendered for money . But what of you , harridan ? How many of the poor have you gulled , taking their hard-earned pence and promising them fortune , health , happiness ? How many folks dying of the plague have you promised to cure ? For how many lonely women have you pretended to see love in that dusty scrying ball of yours ? " " What have you told George of this night 's errand , Master Hogg ? Does he know why he 's here , why you seek Alice 's child ? " " Does she ? " Hogg said , turning to Alice . " Do you know the plans Margery has for your son once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things beyond her understanding , trying for some small measure of power . She hopes to find Arthur and exchange him for that power , for knowledge . Do you understand ? Whatever she 's told you is a lie . She plans to barter with your son 's life . " His voice sounded low and deep , almost plausible . Could what he said be true ? Was Margery using her ? Why had the other woman taken such an interest in her , in Arthur ? The cold wind whistled around them , breaking his spell . Nay  --  what was she thinking ? Margery was her friend ; she knew it . George had proved faithless but that did n't mean that all her friends would betray her . " That 's not true , " she said , and was pleased to hear that her voice sounded steady . " Alice , why are you here ? " George said . " Why do you listen to this woman , this witch ? I warned you at the stationers ' meeting that you put your soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " You warned me ? Nay , you did more ? you nearly sent me to the stake . But I might ask the same of you  --  why do you keep company with this man ? Surely you , who claim to know all the dangers to the soul ? " " What Master Hogg does is lawful , " George said . " Those he keeps company with are the children of light , and no demons . But you , Alice  --  all your friends are the children of darkness . Hogg told me so himself . " Margery laughed . " And you believed him ? George , you 're a bigger fool than I took you for . " p 159 George opened his mouth to reply . But at that moment the fourth man touched Paul Hogg 's shoulder . " There , " he said . They all turned to look . The moon had pierced the clouds , and by its light Alice could see the Fair Folk coming onto the field . Four of the homed men led them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Behind the men walked Queen Oriana , shining in the moon 's light , and even George gasped to look at her . How can he call her a demon ? Alice thought . But then she remembered what Oriana had done to her , to Arthur , and she wondered if the queen 's fairness hid an ugliness within . Could she and Margery be on the wrong side ? Nay  --  they were not on any side ; they were here only to see if Arthur came . Oriana could lose the war for all she cared . Behind the queen came more horned men , their mail glittering like fish scales in the moonlight . Some of them were mounted , and all bore swords . The winged creatures Alice remembered flew among them , and behind them walked Robin Goodfellow , carrying his staff . And look  --  there was Brownie . Her heart turned to see him , so unprotected among the other warriors . Would he fight along with the rest of them ? But he was made for dancing and merriment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk made them all turn to look . A huge horse came onto the field , its hooves striking fire where it walked . Several of the winged creatures skittered away from it as if blown by the wind . It raised itself on its hind legs and neighed , a sound like someone crying . Now Alice could see a shape clinging to its back , a sea-green creature with a long snout . She shuddered . Did George consort with these folk ? A shadow seemed to trail behind the horse , hiding its followes . The sea-creature put a homed shell to its mouth and blew a shrill note , and the horse charged . Then everything became a shock of motion as the two groups met . Here a green man , as pliant as if he had no bones , grappled with one of the twig-people . Over and over they rolled , and the twig man laughed as Alice remembered them laughing the night of the revels . They almost appeared to be playing some sort of game or dancing an ancient dance , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human could never assume . Then she heard something break and the twig man lay unmoving on the field . The sea-creature flowed forward to lift him but at that moment a horned man cut his way through and stabbed the creature to the heart . The substance that flowed from his wound seemed too watery for blood . There a huge man , thick as a tree , headed toward the queen and the standard-bearers . He carried a club in one hand and a length of chain in another , and the links of the chain rattled like bones . Robin Goodfellow stepped forward to meet him . The chain whirled out and Robin caught it on his staff . A moving light covered the two of them , white near Robin and a tarnished green over the other man . Robin pulled the chain from the man 's hand and with a sound like a snarl the man closed with him , his club raised . The light grew brighter and the man fell back . More green men took the field , some walking , some riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , shadows covering their shapes : flying , chittering forms that kept to the trees , things that scuttled near the ground . A few oddly shaped people came with them : a squat man with hands as long as forearms , a woman whose grin nearly reached to her pointed ears . They did not join the battle but stood off to the side , laughing and pointing at the knots of fighting . Finally the train ended with a few who appeared to be human . Why would people fight for these folk ? Or were they slaves , taken from among London 's population ? Could Oriana 's warriors stand up to these ? Her band looked small and slight next to them , and it seemed to Alice that they were fewer than their opponents . Already the winged creatures had retreated to the edge of the field . Several of the twig-people moved this way and that , uncertain , and one of them somersaulted away from the battle . As Alice watched a mounted sea-creature bore down on one of the homed men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood tall and proud , watching the battle from within the circle of her guard . The moon shone over their standards like the sun playing on leaves . Alice heard screams and strange cries , the flapping of wings p 161 and the pounding of hooves . Through it all she looked for Brownie . Finally she saw him , standing a little back from the tight , as if he felt he did not deserve to be included among such heroes . One of the boneless men moved to engage him in battle and he turned to meet it . Then more of the creatures darted out in front of them , and he was lost to sight . Alice looked at Margery . Her friend stood still , a look of great concentration on her face . " A pity this battle will be lost as well , " she heard Paul Hogg say , not sounding sorry at all . " Or did you three think to change its course somehow ? " He laughed . " Nothing has been decided yet , " Margery said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time the war is fought at night , with the moon nearly full . " " Hear her , Alice , " Hogg said . " She admits to it  --  her friends are night-folk , conceived in darkness . " " Aye , and that 's what may save us . Oriana 's people are stronger in the dark . " " You still hope ! " Hogg said . He laughed again . " I tell you , you 've lost . Again . Alice , where is your brownie ? " The fighting had moved to another part of the field ; she could not see Brownie anywhere . What had happened to him ? And how did this man know about him ? But that was easy ? George must have told him . " Did n't you see him fall ? " Hogg said . " Only one of the brave warriors to die this night . " His voice was so full of malice that she turned to him angrily . Words she had heard in the churchyard but had never used formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blade . But just then she heard shouting on the field . " The dragon ! The dragon has come ! " one of the standardbearers called . Others around them took up the cry . The fighting stopped ; everyone looked upward expectantly . In the sky Alice saw not one but two dragons , one of them silver-white and the other a reddish-gold . Which dragon fought for the queen ? All around her folks cried out in fear and won-der . The red dragon spewed fire . On the field the twig-people  |  | scattered in confusion , screaming . " Hold ! " one of the horned men called , but they paid no attention . The silver dragon moved toward its opponent , jaws open , vast wings spread . They grappled , claws out . Fire rained down upon the field . Alice turned to Margery , but the other woman 's expression gave away nothing . Agnes watched the dragons calmly , as if they were a pageant or fireworks display arranged for her amusement . Would nothing move this phlegmatic woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen , and she knew the midwife would be very interested in the outcome . The dragons backed apart . One of them keened ; the other answered . They flew in close again , their silhouettes framed by the moon . Their bodies and the moon seemed to form a coin from a country long fallen to ruin . She thought she saw blood drop to the field . The silver dragon had been hurt ; its wing hung crookedly away from its body . Near her someone gasped . But as they watched the wounded dragon made one final attempt . Its wings turned in as it flew forward ; its neck extended and its jaws gaped wide . The red dragon backed away but its opponent had opened a long gash down its flank . The red dragon keened again and flew away . So the red dragon had lost , Alice thought , surprised at how little she cared . But the silver dragon was leaving too . Folks began to drop their weapons and stand as if amazed , the queen 's band on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard-bearers advanced toward the center of the field . From the other side came a man Alice had never seen , tall and clad in red mail , with a crown red as fire . Several of his warriors walked behind him . " Now they parley , " Margery said . " But who won ? " Agnes asked . " No one . No one has won . Neither side has enough men to continue the fight . " " But someone has lost , " Paul Hogg said . " The queen has lost her ablest warriors this night . Go back to your cottage and sell  | your charms for twopence , Margery . The next time these two meet will be the last . " " Aye , the last , " Margery said . How could she stay so calm ? " The battle will end when Arthur is found . " Arthur ! Alice had forgotten him . But Margery had been wrong ; he had n't come to this battle . Whatever ties he had to the Fair Folk had loosened , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him again , him or her true son . " Arthur 's dead , or lost forever , " Hogg said . " And what man would fight for a woman who cared so little for him she gave him away at birth ? " " Who would fight for a man who never takes the field , thinking only about his own safety ? See where he comes , your king . King of the Cowards , they call him . " " But they fight for him just the same . " " They have no choice . He 's bound them to him with his arts . " " You lie . Nothing he does is unlawful . And next you 'll tell me that Oriana 's people fight out of love . " The king and queen had reached the center of the field and began to talk in low voices . Alice studied the group around them , trying to make out the humans who had fought against ( ) riana . Was it true that they were bound to the king by necromancy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashes of water down the front of their jerkins . She closed her right eye and saw the faerie-light on them . Of course , she thought , remembering the stories from her childhood . They were water-people , lying in wait at the side of lakes and rivers , ready to drown travelers walking by . The stains on their clothing gave them away . Opposite this group the queen stood , straight as a sword and unyielding , her warriors grouped in a semicircle behind her . What did they talk about ? What terms would the red king force from Oriana ? If her folk left London would Alice ever see Arthur again ? Whenever people talked about war Alice always thought of the individual people who would have to die . She was not like the others in the churchyard in this , she knew ; when they had rung the bells and built the bonfires at the defeat of the Spanish 164 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Armada two years ago she could not share in the exultation of her neighbors . She had thought only , Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fair Folk cared nothing for Arthur , she knew that . Margery could not claim that Oriana 's people fought out of love ; whatever emotions they felt love could not be one of them . They understood nothing about the bond between mother and son . Not one of these finely dressed folk would consider her or her son in their decisions . Suddenly Alice cried out and ran onto the field . She heard Margery call something after her but she ignored her and made for a small bundle of fur near the queen and king . Brownie lay curled up on the grass , a long gash open on his flank . The blood that matted his fur looked black in the moonlight . As Alice watched he breathed in shallowly . He was alive ! " Margery ! " she said loudly . " Margery , help me ! " Margery went to join her . " We must not interrupt the parley , " she said , speaking softly . " The parley be damned . He 's alive . We have to help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margery opened her purse . Alice had been watching Brownie , willing him to continue breathing , and by the time she looked back at her friend Margery had taken out a cloth dipped in herbs . Where had she wetted the cloth ? It did n't matter ; what mattered was that she smoothed the cloth over Brownie 's fur , that his breathing grew more even , that the wound seemed to close a little . At last he opened his eyes and looked up at them . " Did we win ? " He sat up , a worried look in his soft brown eyes . " Nay . Lie back , " Margery said . " Queen Oriana ? " " Hush . She rules still . " Brownie fell back , satisfied . " We have to get him to my house , " Alice said . Margery looked up at her friend . " Do you think that 's wise ? " " It does n't matter . Someone has to care for him . " Margery seemed to see the logic of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brownie 's arms . Alice took his other arm carefully and they lifted him together . He was surprisingly light . They sat him down against a tree at the edge of the field . George nodded when he saw them , as if his suspicions had been proven correct . Did he still think that Brownie was a demon ? How could he , when he consorted with things far more evil-seeming ? Alice thought that George 's mind must be a kind of swamp where nothing was clear-edged , where he believed whatever was easiest for him to believe . " You 've found him , I see , " Hogg said . " Aye , " Alice said . " And still alive . " " For the moment . I doubt he 'll last the night . " Alice turned to Margery , seeking reassurance , and for once her friend gave it to her . " You must not believe anything Paul I Iogg says , " Margery said firmly . " He 's told me many lies over the years , have n't you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me , " Hogg said . He looked distracted , anxious about something , and a moment later Alice saw what it was : the parley had ended . The queen and king bowed to each other elaborately and , Alice thought , a little mockingly . Then both sides retreated , and the work of gathering up the dead for burial began . A chill wind blew suddenly and Alice shivered . " It 's over , " Margery said . " Nothing 's changed  --  there are a few more dead on both sides , that 's all . It wo n't end until Arthur is found . " " And she claims that I lie ! " Paul Hogg said . " It 's clear to me that Oriana 's folk lost here . One more battle and your precious queen will be vanquished . " " We 'll find Arthur before then . " " Arthur ! " Hogg laughed . " Alice , let me tell you your future . Arthur is dead . And when she learns the truth about your son , Margery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't she , to progress beyond her small petty magics . You will grow old alone , with no one to love you . You will die in bed , and so little will you be missed that your body will not be discovered for three days . " How had he known her deepest nightmares , her dread of 166 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | growing old and friendless ? Was that why she had rescued Brownie , because she knew she could not keep company with humans ? He was wrong about Margery , though  --  her friend had no magic , only wisdom and a strong knowledge of plants and stones . She shook her head , not wanting to bandy words with this odious man any further . " Good night , " Margery said to Hogg . " I know we 'll meet again . " " Good night , " Hogg said . As he and his men turned to go Alice saw that one of them , the fourth man , had a stain on his jerkin like that of the water-people . She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though green and tarnished , the way it had appeared over the man who had fought with Robin Goodfellow . What hold did Hogg have over this creature ? How had he made one of the water-people serve him ? Brownie was able to walk by the time they left the field , though the nut-brown color of his face had faded to a pale gray . Agnes did not remark on their new companion ; no doubt she had seen stranger sights tonight . They said nothing for most of the long walk home , each woman thinking her own thoughts . As they reached Cheapside they heard the bellman give his call : " Remember the clocks , Look well to your locks , Fire and your light , And God give you good night , For now the bell ringeth , One o'clock . " Without discussing it they hid in a small alley as he passed . " I wonder what he 'd make of us , " Agnes said , laughing , as he passed . " Maybe he 'd think we were whores . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make could be as dreadful as what George had said at the stationers ' meeting yesterday . Had it been only yesterday ? So much had happened since then : the play , and Walter . . . She felt a pleasant warmth spread through her at the thought p 167 Walter , and she told herself firmly to forget him . Love did not come to someone her age ; the only thing left to her was caring folks and easing their pain : her strange son , and John in his ii illness , and now Brownie . . . It was not much , but it was work that would keep her until she died . As if to prove that her life held no new joy she said to Margery , " Arthur never came . " " Nay . I 'm sorry . " " I wonder why not . " " Who knows ? No one can say why these folk do what they " What happens if Oriana loses the war ? " " ' To your son , you mean ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ? " " So we must find him . " Or killed , Margery had been about to y . She had never been one to spare her friend 's feelings . " Aye . " They came up to Paternoster Row and Alice 's house . And soon . Good night . " lice could barely come awake the next day but she took time look at Brownie and bind his wound . Then she walked to Paul 's ; she could not afford three days ' absence at the churchrd . As she went through the gate she saw Walter coming from is stall to greet her . " I looked for you all day yesterday , " he said . " Were you ill ? " At his words strong feelings coursed through her like lightning , excitement and pleasure and desire . Her face grew hot nil she wondered if he could see it , and the thought made her color more . Blushing , at her age ! " I went to visit my friend Margery , " she said . Damn , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . Now he would tell her she should stop seeing Margery , that she should he careful after the accusations leveled at her the day before . Ile said nothing . He was not George , after all . But the trip had been dangerous ; if anyone still harbored suspicions that she was a witch this would have confirmed them . She felt glad that he did not pry , that he left her alone to make her own 168 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | decisions , and thinking this she remembered again how pleasant his company had been the other day . " There were strange sights last night , " he said . " So they say in the churchyard , anyway . Dragons , two of them , fighting against the moon . Did you see them ? " She could n't think what to reply . But her face must have given something away , because he said , " Has this anything to do with you ? Or with Margery ? " She wished she could answer him . Not because she wanted advice about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just so that she could stay and talk with him a little longer . " Nay , of course not , " she said , and turned to go .  | Warmer days came to London . The nobility left for their estates or to follow the queen on her progress but the city seemed as full as ever . The acting companies that had gone on tour returned and joined the ones that had remained in the city , drawing huge crowds , showing five or six plays a week . Beggars and pilgrims , madwomen and thieves came as well , and gypsies in scarves and bells who danced and spat fire and told fortunes . The streets stank of offal left to rot in the sun , and the people stank too , and doused themselves liberally with perfume to cover the smell . Kites and ravens flew overhead . Tom Nashe made his way through the crowds in St. Paul 's churchyard , heading toward Alice 's stall . He was driven by a kind of anger ; Christopher still refused to discuss what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice as the only person in London he could talk to . He was jostled as he walked through the churchyard , and without thinking he put his hand to his hat to keep it from falling . He had recently unearthed the hat from among his old clothing , and had pinned the unfading silver flower to it like a lady 's favor . " Good day , " Alice said as he came up to her stall . She always smiled when she saw him , he realized , as if she 170 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | expected him to say something witty . He wished he could . " Good day , " he said . " I think I have news of Arthur . " She looked at him sharply , not hiding the interest on her face . He began to tell her about the strange land he had come to , the women weaving garlands , the flower he had been given . As he talked he felt a vast relief ; he had n't realized how much he needed to unburden himself to someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that land ? " she asked . " Nay . I felt  --  I felt almost as if someone watched me , studied me , and then passed me over . They were looking for Arthur , I 'm certain of it . And it seemed to me that ? " He searched for a way to explain it to her . " That the land itself was a sort of door . That Arthur reached out without effort and opened the land like a door , and passed through to  --  to  --  I ca n't think where . To another land , maybe . " " Then he 's gone . " " Gone for now . I think he left because too many people want him . He was involved with a plot to kill the queen ? " " I know . Perhaps it 's good he 's gone  --  I do n't think he understands the danger he 's in . " " And now these people are looking for him , for their own reasons , whatever they are ? " He saw Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And she could not bring herself to tell him what it was because she had heard of his reputation : that he liked to gossip , liked rumor , liked to pass a tale back and forth . She said nothing . " Who is Arthur , that he has such power ? " he asked . " That he can travel through that land without being stopped by  --  by whatever lives there ? " She was not good at dissembling . He could see that she wanted to tell him , and that fear and caution stopped her . He had heard that she had been called before the queen 's court , and that she had been nearly ordered to leave the Stationers ' Company , and he understood that it would be dangerous for her to discuss these matters . She could not talk to him , and Kit would not . He felt his need for information almost as a need for nourishment ; he was fam- p 171 ished for it . He would be discreet , he thought ; he would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would begin to confide in him . Only that way could he answer to his own satisfaction the question of Arthur . " I 'll tell you if I discover anything , " he said . As he turned to go he saw Christopher across the press of people . Kit nodded to him . He felt almost as if he had received an answer to his vow ; here , in front of Alice , he could show how little he discussed Arthur with his friends . He nodded back and stood his ground , waiting until the other man made his way to the stall . " What have you been doing ? " he asked Kit . " Working . And you ? " Talking to Alice Wood , he thought , but he could n't say that . " I walked a little , " Tom said . " Wrote a letter to Gabriel Harvey . " Ile had , in fact , written the letter a few days ago , and now he grinned to think of it . " I was writing my pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read some poems that he had written , so that I might better take aim against him . And I read one that had six feet to the line , and then suddenly , hey , presto ! ? it had seven . So I wrapped his poem around a louse and then wrote underneath it , This verse has more feet than a louse , ' and I sent it to him . " " Why do you so malign that man ? I agree with you that he is an ass ? " " An ass ? That prating weasel-faced vermin ? That cheesebrained idiot ? " " An idiot , then . But surely you have better things to do than to set your pen against Gabriel Harvey . Why do you waste your time ? " " Why ? It is a cause of great disquiet to me that he breathes the same air I do , that he and I are both alive at the same time . I will never leave him as long as I am able to lift a pen . " Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm glad to see it . " Back ? What do you mean ? " " I mean that for some time you would talk about nothing but the land you claimed to have seen . It was almost as if you were 172 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | ill . And now you 're well again  --  you have to be well if you 're back to plaguing the Harveys . " " It was n't an illness , " Tom said . " It 's an enchantment . They 've enchanted me . " " You 're fortunate I 'm not your physician  --  I can see now I 've misjudged your symptoms completely . You 're as sick as ever . You 've even got that silly flower in your hat . " " Aye , and what of it ? Where do you think this flower comes from ? Why has n't it faded in all these weeks ? " " I suppose because it 's not a real flower . " " Not a real flower ? Look at it , man ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had it made by a skilled artificer . " " Why in God 's name would I do that ? " " I do n't know . Why do you persist in this obsession ? " " You 're the one who 's obsessed . You 're the one who thinks he knows the answer to every question . Who were those strange men you saw at the palace ? You 've never found out , have you ? And yet I 'll wager that those men had something to do with Arthur . " " What if they did ? I 've finished with the task I was asked to do . Whoever those men were they had nothing to do with the conspiracy against the queen . " " You 're wrong , " Tom said , driven , once again , by the anger he seemed to feel these days whenever he saw his friend . " You ca n't possibly know that . " " Nay  --  I ca n't talk to you in this mood , " Christopher said . He spoke calmly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might say . " Let me know when you recover . Good day . " He left . " You 're not finished yet ! " Tom said , shouting after him . " This thing did n't end  --  there 's more here than either one of us knows ! " But Christopher was lost in the crowd . Suddenly he remembered Alice Wood . He had been aware of her at first , had seen her laugh a little when he talked about Gabriel Harvey , but in the heat of the argument he had forgotten her entirely . And what of his vow to say nothing to anyone p 173 about Arthur ? No wonder she did n't trust him ; he would n't trust himself , if it came to that . Ile took his leave of her , and , feeling friendless and desperly unhappy , he turned to go . Christopher walked back to his lodgings outside the city walls , thinking of his conversation with Tom . Why should his friend he so certain that his task for the queen had n't ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Tom knew : Christopher would never have to work for Robert Poley again . He was done with secret errands , done with the whole shadowy world of eavesdroppers and hedge-creepers . I le had gone back to court for his final payment from the queen 's councilors , and while there had met a distant cousin of Sir Francis Walsingham 's , a young man named Thomas Walsingham . The young man had heard of him and had enjoyed his plays , and had offered to become his patron , freeing him from the necessity of writing a play or two a year . With the money from Thomas Walsingham Christopher had had the leisure to begin a poem . It was almost enough to restore his old belief in the Fates . But nay  --  there were no Fates . People made their own destinies . Why did Tom cling to his superstitious ways ? Why was he so obsessed with this nonsense ? He remembered what Tom had said , that he was under an enchantment . If he thought of himself as enchanted would n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile shook his head . People were stranger than you 'd ever guess . Will Ryder , for example . He expected to be liked not because he had lived a privileged life , with folks deferring to his wealth and station , but because he was genuinely likeable . He had read what Christopher had written of the poem and had said , with what seemed like real warmth , that he 'd rarely seen better . He 'd asked countless questions about the theater , about London , about growing up in Canterbury . And he 'd talked about his own life with a straightforwardness Christopher had found unusual . But he could n't escape his upbringing , and it showed at odd 174 LISA GOLDSTEIN moments . A few days ago they had gone to a dinner given by a friend of Will 's , and halfway through the meal he had seen Will looking at him with an expression of mingled amusement and superiority . He could n't understand why until he noticed that everyone else at the table was using strange utensils shaped like small pitchforks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're called forks , " Will had whispered . " An Italian custom . " After that Christopher had made it a point to leave his fork untouched , to cover his hands with as much grease as he could . And Will was young , too , and sheltered in a way Christopher had n't seen since Cambridge . The world of intrigue was new and exciting to him ; his assignment from Essex , he had said ingenuously , was his first . He asked endless questions , and he gave away Essex 's secrets with a profligacy Christopher found endearing . The light began to fade as Christopher walked . He should be thinking about his poem . It would be evening soon , and he had added nothing to the poem since yesterday . Perhaps he was no true poet after all ; perhaps he should stay with the stage , with what he knew . He had it in mind to write a play based on the life of Edward II from the Chronicles , based too on his discovery that people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't Will said he liked the poem ? He watched as dusk came down over the street before him . Will would be waiting for him at his lodgings . He hurried on before darkness fell .  | The summer of 1592 was the hottest folks could remember in a long time , and the heat lingered on into September . The Thames dried up , and Alice heard of people who walked from shore to shore on the muddy bottom . At her station in the churchyard , looking out at the sparse crowds , she wondered if the Fair Folk had chosen this way to show their displeasure . Two years had passed since the battle she had witnessed and they had still not found Arthur . But people had other worries beside the heat , for the summer had also brought the plague . Funeral processions , held late to discourage crowds , passed her house nightly ; one had been for her assistant , who had died a week ago . In the neighborhood of Paul 's alone she had counted four households with red crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were infected . People with red wands , the sign of someone attending a family stricken with the plague , walked up and down the streets , knocking at doors . Those who could leave London to visit friends or relatives had done so , and the ones who stayed rarely ventured out of doors . When they did they had identical stricken looks , as though they feared some great disaster were about to crush  | them , and they carried oranges stuck through with a stick of cinnamon or handkerchiefs drenched in white vinegar for pro-tection . Thomas Nashe , who knew everything , had told her that 1600 people died each week and warned her to leave London . Then he had followed his own advice and gone away , along with all the other poets who could find patrons in the country . She had stayed on , reasoning that if the plague had not killed her when she had nursed John she might be safe from its attack . But she had other , more complex , motives for staying . Arthur might return , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , working at his stall . Walter . She looked over to where he stood , as lacking in customers as she herself was . They had gone to plays over the years and had shared a few meals at the cookshop , but it was as she had thought  --  he did not seem interested in deepening their friendship . And with the playhouses closed by the city authorities because of the plague they had not seen much of each other recently . But she still sometimes felt a looseness , an excitement , when she saw him . It seemed to her that she had an illness even worse than the plague , worse because it would not end but lingered on year after year . Anthony Drury , dressed once again in severe black , came into the churchyard and went over to talk to George . She frowned . George had been seeing much of the man , and she wondered if they still looked for Arthur . She thought that no good could come from George 's association with Anthony , but she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought new copyrights and had hired a great many young men to work at his station . And with his prosperity had come a new authority ; folks listened to his opinions more , and he was often called upon to speak at the stationers ' meetings . There was even talk of making him an officer in the company . She wondered if he had persisted in his accusations against her . Sometimes when she passed through the churchyard she thought she saw people glance in her direction and then grow quiet , and she felt that some of the stationers had cooled toward her . But perhaps she only imagined it . p 179 Anthony and George left the churchyard together . It might soon be time to leave herself ; no one had come by her stall in e past hour . She glanced over at Walter one last time , then backed up her books and went home . The air in the house was hot and stale . She opened the windows in her front room and then went to the kitchen . Brownie lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is face . I le had been weak for months after the battle , but his wound ad healed finally under her careful treatment . Afterward , ough , he had become sullen , uncommunicative , almost unfriendly . In the mornings she sometimes found her hair plaited to elf-locks , or her butter rancid , or mounds of dust behind er bed . Once he had even turned her sideboard against the all . She had needed the help of three strong men to turn it back again , hired men , for she had not wanted anyone from the churchyard to see it . He did almost no work , and while she had n't rescued him to be her servant she could not help but resent him a little for it . Now he sat up , his red cap dropping to the floor . He made no move to pick it up . She wondered if he expected their roles reverse so that she became the servant and he the master , nd she thought sharply that if that was the case she would row him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nough to do on her own . " Ho , " he said , rubbing his eyes . " Home so early ? " She had not heard him speak so much in a long time . To keep ' him talking she said , " Aye . Trade was bad today . Bad this entire summer , for that matter . Everyone 's gone because of the plague . " " Plague ? " She looked at him in amazement . But the Fair Folk did n't come ill , did n't die , is far as she could tell , unless they were illed . The plague that caused her and her neighbors such fear nd dread , that nearly ruled her life , meant nothing to him . ) nce again she thought of how much Brownie was like Arthur , ut this time she understood why she made the comparison . 180 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Aye , the plague . Thousands have died already . You have have heard something of it . " " Nay . I have n't left the house for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he had died h made her suddenly grow angry . " Nay . You stay in my hometl and do nothing but sour my beer . Why do n't you go back to Oriana ? You 're certainly well enough . " To her surprise Brownie became angry too . " By wind a rain , did you think I wanted to be here ? Did you think it was idea ? I would a thousand times rather be in the woods or field dancing with my friends . " " Then why do you stay ? " But Brownie had turned silent again , and she saw that he had given away more than he wanted . She pressed him . " You 're not a help to me here . Do n't think that I would miss you if you Icfl Truly it would be easier for me if you went away . George ha told the other stationers that you 're a demon . " Brownie backed toward the hearth , the way he had done t first night she had seen him . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " " The queen has commanded me to stay . " " Oriana ? Why ? " " Because ? " He sounded reluctant , but she saw that he wanted to tell her . " To spy on you . " " To spy ? " " Aye . In case Arthur comes back . " She could not help but feel a sense of betrayal . She had thought that Brownie stayed on , however reluctantly , out d loyalty to her , out of gratitude for the care she had given hire Now she saw that other forces operated here : they were ii pawns in a larger game . " Go then . I wo n't be spied on . " " I ca n't . Queen Oriana wo n't have me . " She almost laughed . What could she do , throw him out of the house ? She was not even certain how he had come to be then the first time . " Well , then , " she said . " As long as you 're here let ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy ? " " You showed me to that man , the one with the hard face .  | " I know , Brownie . That was a mistake . I wo n't do it again , I promise you . " " Aye , you will .

" " How do you know that ? " she said , sharper than she had intended . " You folks know nothing about love . " " We know some things . Love is a mystery to us , but we can recognize it in others . Someday you will forget your promise to me . You will be so happy to be with him , so eager to do something wonderful for him , that you will bring him inside and show me to him . " " Nay , Brownie . Trust me , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you this , by my hope of winning Arthur back . " lie seemed to relax a little . She smiled at him and went to make herself a small supper , and that night , without saying anything to her , Brownie cleaned the dishes and pans . omas Kyd walked through the deserted streets toward Paul 's . Today , he thought , he would buy himself a book . Not a history hook to base a play on , and not something written by one of his friends , but a book to read solely for enjoyment . He smiled a little as he walked , thinking of the luxury he was about to allow himself . He had sold his play Soliman and Perseda before the closing of the playhouses , and for very nearly the first time in his life he felt he had enough money for his modest desires . A woman carrying a basket and a red wand hurried down the street and stopped in front of a door marked with a red cross . The door opened , and a breath of rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned to watch as the woman went inside the house , delivering food to those quarantined by the plague . What would it be like to minister to folks who were ill , to have to come in daily contact with the infection ? Like living in London during the plague season , he thought , and abruptly his good humor vanished . 182 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | He had some money , true , but it would not stretch far enough to take him away from London . If he had a patron he could be out of the city , enjoying the healthy air of the countryside . Lord Strange , for example : Strange 's company of actors performed everything he wrote . But no invitation from Strange had been forthcoming , and he could not help but feel a little resentful . How many years did a man have to serve his lord in order to receive favors from him ? A year ago he and Christopher had taken a room together , thinking that they both needed a place to write , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that unlike him the other man had found a patron . The thought galled him . How had Kit deserved such good fortune while he was left to struggle against the plague ? But nay  --  it was best not to think of such things . He glanced up the street and saw Arthur coming toward him . He raised his hand to hail the man before he realized his mistake . This was n't Arthur but some poor starving beggar , his clothes torn to rags and nearly falling off his shrunken frame . As he watched the man stumbled and went down . Tom ran forward . It was Arthur , he saw now , but an Arthur strangely changed , with hollow eyes and a haunted expression on his face . What had happened to him in the two years since he 'd seen him last ? Tom 's heart turned to see him looking so frail , so lost . " Arthur , " he said , bending over the other man . " Arthur , are you ill ? Do you need help ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and an open sore on one of his arms . " Where were you ? " Tom asked . " Dead , " Arthur said . " I was dead and in heaven , or some place like it . Do they still search for me ? " " Who ? " " Everyone . Everyone wants me . Do you know why ? " He looked around anxiously and then whispered to Tom , " Because I 'm king . " Tom looked around as well . If anyone heard them they could be arrested for treason . " Listen , " he said , shaking Arthur 's shoulders to make him pay attention . " Listen , Arthur  --  you must not say such things . Do you understand ? "  | " But it 's true . They all told me so , in the country I went to  --  they told me I was king . It was because I 'm a king that they wanted to  --  to ? " His eyes clouded for a moment , and he shuddered . " So I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , and then to a land beyond that . There are as many countries in that place as there are drops of water . " " Do n't say it even if it 's true . They 'll arrest you if you claim to be king . Do you understand ? They 're looking for you anyway , I heard  --  they think you had something to do with the plot against the queen . " Arthur looked up at that . " The queen ? " Tom sighed . What could he do with this man ? The queen 's men searched for him , and so , he knew , did Christopher and Tom Nashe . Nay , he would not allow this sad lunatic to fall into the hands of Tom and Kit , to be used for God only knew what purposes . He straightened , and as he did so an idea came to him . He thought for a moment of the book he had been about to buy ; he would not be able to afford it now . " Get up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to do . " Please . " Arthur got to his feet and followed Tom for several yards before stopping and looking at the empty streets around him . " Where am I ? " he said , his voice suddenly uncertain . " What country is this ? " Tom turned and stared at him in amazement . " England . London . Do you understand ? " " Oh , aye , " Arthur said , sounding reassured . " I 'm king here too , you know . " Tom walked faster , not caring now if Arthur followed him or not . They went through side-roads and alleys and came at last to Bishopsgate . Once through the city wall they passed St. Botolph 's Church and then turned in at the gate to St. Mary of Bethlehem Hospital . Tom stood in front of the asylum for a while , studying it : a long low building with two dark wings coming forward on either side . Would this be a good place for Arthur ? He shrugged ; he had no choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the steward 's office . 184 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Ah , " the steward said as they came in . " Is he a relative ? " " Nay , " Tom said . " A  --  a friend . " The steward frowned . " Lodging in Bedlam is not cheap . " " I  --  I 'm prepared to pay . He has nowhere else to go , and I thought  --  well , I ca n't take care of him ? " " Ah . " The steward nodded ; apparently they were on more familiar ground here . " Good . Come with me . " Tom followed the other man down a brick corridor . The place was ill lit and smelled of sweat and urine and rotting straw . There were ten barred cells , five to a side , and in front of each of them stood the folks who had paid to view the lunatics . Inside the cells men and women laughed or pointed or shouted vile abuse . A few of them lay bound in chains . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to get a message to my daughter , " she said . " Tell her ? " Tom looked around him in dismay . Surely he could find something better for Arthur than this prison . By what right did he think he could sentence Arthur here for what would probably be the rest of his life ? But what else could he do ? He certainly could n't turn him over to the queen 's men ; Arthur could be killed for treason if they found him . And he would not allow the poor man to be a pawn in Torn and Kit 's intrigues . If Kit wanted Arthur he should have stayed in London and looked for him himself . Arthur went meekly into the cell , and the steward closed the door and turned the key in the lock . A few days later George went with Anthony to the house off Cheapside . The day had grown hot , and flies buzzed around the garbage in the streets . George felt weary ; he wanted only to go home and rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while Hogg continued to give him coins from a seemingly endless supply he could not help but wish that they made more progress . Two years , and they still had n't found Arthur . Where was the boy ? George remembered him from the churchyard : a simple dreamy lad , almost a half-wit . How had he managed to elude a man like Hogg , who seemed to have all knowledge at his command ? And the Fair Folk searched for him  | well , both the red king and Oriana , and Alice and Marg- George felt the silk lining on his jerkin and looked at the ruby ngs sparkling on his hand . It seemed to him that the more riches he had the more he needed . His shop had expanded too uickly , and then the plague had brought an end to a large part his trade . He owed money to some of his creditors , and to his w workers and apprentices as well . When would they find hur , and with him the final step in their search for gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses , trying to ke advantage of what little shade the wall offered . His mouth as open and he panted shallowly . George looked away uickly . A plague victim , probably , and who knew where the ness would strike next ? But if Hogg found the way to the hilosopher 's Stone he would live forever . The plague could of touch him . The man said something in a weak voice , begging for alms , probably , and George and Anthony hurried on . They entered the small house . It had grown more cluttered since his first visit , more filled with glass and tubing , manuscripts and stones and vials of sulphur and salt and mercury . In c past two years Hogg had gone through the remaining steps the alchemical process , all but the final one . At first George ad watched with great interest as Hogg heated and distilled nd purified , as he hunted for certain minerals by the light of e moon . The substance in the alembic had grown red-hot , riled black , become liquid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , carefully explaining why he sealed c vessel when he did , why he warmed it with fire , why he unsealed it again . As the process dragged on , though , George had grown tired f it . He wanted only the result , the Philosopher 's Stone ; how Hogg got there was unimportant . Now , as he went inside , he danced at the alembic in its place on the floor , still unchanged . c sighed . Hogg welcomed him , his normally grave face shining with pleasure . His assistant , the man with the stain on his doublet , stood behind him in the shadows . " We found him , " Hogg said umphantly . " We 've found Arthur . " 186 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | At last , George thought . " Where is he ? " " Look . " Hogg led him to the table and pointed to the scrying stone there . At first George could see nothing . Then it seemed as if mist cleared away , and a picture formed of a beautiful young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into wild soundless laughter . " Is he enchanted ? " George asked . " I do n't know , " Hogg said . " That is what we must discover . Come . " George watched as Hogg traced a circle around the floor . Over the years he had become convinced that most of Hogg 's conjuring , his Latin and Greek and other strange tongues , meant very little to the Fair Folk , that they came and went as they pleased . Sometimes they even appeared before Hogg had finished his invocation , breaking into the middle of his long and solemn chants . Even more ominously , the folk sometimes came without being called at all . The green creature still followed Anthony at times , though it had not attacked him again , and Alice had her demon . And George had finally recognized the man with the water-stain as kin to the people who had fought against Oriana . He wondered if those who meddled with these folk somehow bound them unknowingly . Hogg had assured him that what they did was lawful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary . But lately , when he walked home , he heard the steps of someone  --  something  --  following him . One of the green men appeared in the middle of Hogg 's circle . George stepped back , still not used to the thing 's sudden appearances , and the creature laughed , showing sharp crooked teeth . " We have found Arthur in the scrying glass , " Hogg said to it . " But we can not discover his whereabouts . " He indicated the glass on the table , among the litter of instruments . The image of Arthur laughed again , silently , and George shuddered . Now he noticed that the man in the glass seemed ill : he had grown thinner , and his hair was caked with dirt . His green eyes looked enormous in the thin face . What had happened to him ? " His whereabouts ? " the creature said . " Oh , that 's easy , very STRANGE DEVICES OF THE SUN AND MOON 187 easy . Ask me something difficult . " It hissed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snout , the pointed teeth . " Where is he ? " Hogg said . The creature laughed . " In Bedlam . " " Bedlam ? " George said , forgetting to keep silent . " But we searched there . We went to all the hospitals . " The thing slowly turned its snout toward him . George tried and failed to meet its gaze . " Aye , Bedlam , " it said . " You must and bring him back for us . " It vanished before Hogg could vc it permission to go . George looked at Hogg , hoping for an explanation . But the other man seemed confused , uncertain , and for once he said nothing . In the past two years George had grown used to Lying on Hogg for guidance , and for a moment he felt frightened , alone . Then Hogg seemed to rouse himself , and the oment passed . " Come , " the other man said firmly . " We 'll go Bedlam. " the asylum Hogg walked up to the steward 's office and socked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George td witnessed earlier . He talked with the steward a while and then paid the penny entrance fee for each of them . The steward Hinted to the left wing and went back into his office . George followed Hogg down the dark corridor , looking around him apprehensively . How had Arthur come to this dreadful place ? Who had paid for his lodgings ? If it had been ice , would n't she miss him when they took him away ? I lc shook his head . It was not his place to ask such questions ; doubt Hogg knew what he was doing . George hurried after K other man . Hogg stopped at the last cell . The young man they had seen the scrying glass sat in the room , leaning against the wall . His tithes were torn and dirty and he seemed even thinner than he td in the glass . He had the look of someone who had been exposed to the elements for a very long time . Despite this , George felt jubilant . They had won ; they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hogg said pleasantly . " We 've come to take you home . " 188 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Arthur laughed . Had he even heard the other man ? It didn ' matter : they would trade him to the red king and have don with him . " Come , " Hogg said . At this Arthur turned to him . " Where ? " he said . His han moved up and down by his side , as if to unseen music . " I 'm taking you home . " " Home ? Where is that ? " " To your people , the Fair Folk . " Hogg 's voice was gentler and more persuasive than George had ever heard it . " Ah . " Arthur met the other man 's eyes for the first time . " Wi it be safe for me there ? " " Aye , very safe , " Hogg said . George looked away , hoping that his face did not betray his thoughts . He had never wondered what the red king wanted with Arthur , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be safe at all . Battles , probably , and harsh conquests , blood and war . " Who are my people , then ? " Arthur asked , plaintively . " Do you know ? I know only that my mother is a queen . " A queen ? George thought . What folly was this ? Alice was Arthur 's mother . " This is no fit place for you , Your Majesty , " Hogg said softly . " You should be at the front of your troops , leading them into battle . " " Aye . " Arthur 's green eyes seemed to shine in the dark room . " In battle . I fought , you know , when I left . I went to far countries , and men flocked to my banner . Aye . " Which side did he fight on ? George wondered , but he thought that it probably did n't matter . The man had never held a lance or ridden a horse in his life . " I saw many things , many strange sights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails and paws , and a sword that would fight by itself .

So I came home , thinking that I would have honor among my own people as well . " He stopped and looked around him , puzzled , as if coming  | but of a dream . What he had claimed for himself was so at odds with his true surroundings that George expected him to veer off to madness again . Instead he looked closely at Hogg and said , ho are you ? " " A friend , " Hogg said . " Aye ? I wonder . " " Why should you wonder , Your Majesty ? I 'm here to take you your people , your subjects . They 're waiting for you . They red to be shown a true leader . " Arthur seemed to think it over . His hand moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . They could force him , of course , but it would be easier , and attract less attention , if he would agree to go with them . George stepped closer to the bars of the cell . " Come , Your Majesty . Do you remember me ? I was a friend of yours , in the churchyard . " " Nay , I wo n't go there again . Go away , all of you ! Alice Wood is not my mother  --  my mother is a queen ! " Hogg turned to George angrily . " Nay , we wo n't make you go to the churchyard , " George said , as gently as he could . His heart was beating very fast . What if Arthur would not leave now , what if he had ruined everything ? Arthur had to agree . " We 're here to take you to your true family , not to Alice . Alice has lied to you all these years , do you understand ? She 's not your mother . " George nodded , satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth ? Alice had lied often enough on other subjects ; she was a liar . And he would say anything if only Arthur would leave with them . He did not think he could face Hogg if they had been unsuccessful . " Very well , " Arthur said finally . He stood up , bracing himself against the wall as he did so . George wondered how long he had sat there . " I 'll come with you . " His tone was that of a monarch commanding his subjects . For a moment George forgot who the other man was and what they planned to do with him , and nearly jumped to do his bidding . ' Then he looked about him and remembered . " Good , " Hogg said . " I 'll get the steward to release you . " He went back down the corridor and returned with the steward , 190 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | who now held a ring of keys in his hand .

A month ago he had dined with Tom Nashe on Rhenish wine and pickled herring , and he thought it was this rather than the plague that made him grow weaker and weaker , until he finally took to his bed . Now he lay in the house of ' Master and Mistress Isam , a shoemaker and his wife who been kind enough to take him in , and he thought about his life . He would go to hell unless he repented , there was no question of it . He had deserted his wife and child after running through his wife 's dowry , he had fathered a bastard child on Em of Holywell Street , he had sold his play , Orlando Furioso , to two companies of actors , first to the Queen 's Men and then the Admiral 's Men .

It was not his fault he had been forced into these and other tricks : he had had hard luck , and then he had fallen into had company .. . Aye , bad company .

If he went to hell it would be the fault of compan-192 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | ions like Tom , Tom and that damned atheist friend of his , Kit Marlowe . He groaned to think of the last meal he and Tom had shared , and its aftermath . His belly had swollen upward until he felt it would burst . He wished he had n't gone with Tom . He wished many things , that he had n't left his wife , had n't come to London ... His entire life could have been different , richer , happier ? and he would not now be lying in this strange house , dying and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life before , but now for the first time he thought he truly understood what it meant to be damned . Terror rose up in him like bile , until it seemed to drive every other feeling out , until he seemed made of fear . " Oh , no end is limited to damned souls , " he thought , and the aptness of the quotation pleased him , made him forget his pain for a while , until he remembered it had been written by that unbeliever Marlowe . How could the man have known ? There had to be something he could do , some bargain he could strike . If he repented , if he showed that he was sincere about repenting .. . He called weakly to Mistress Isam . She had been in another room but she heard and came hurrying toward him , wiping her hands on her apron . She had strange notions about poets and playwrights : she thought that they deserved to be honored , and so she had kept him in her house and nursed him through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was grateful to her for that , and for the enthusiasm with which she talked about his plays and books , but he could not help but feel a little impatient with her . She moved so slowly , and when she started talking it was difficult sometimes to get her to stop . But how could he complain ? Without her aid he would be dying on the streets . " What is it , Master Greene ? " " I need pen and paper . Please . " She brightened . " Of course . " No doubt she thought he was about to compose something brilliant . And perhaps he would at that . He smiled at her when she brought him what he 'd asked for , sat up painfully and dipped his pen in the ink . If he had to p 193 die he would at least leave a legacy for his friends .

The days cooled slightly and e plague abated , and some of those who had fled London turned . Christopher walked from his lodgings to the river , and then red a boat to take him to the Ryders ' manor . He and Will had ne their separate ways for a few months , had each left Lon-n to escape the plague , but on his return he had sensed a stance in Will that had not been there before . Ile wondered what had happened between them . He had ever met anyone as even-tempered as Will , and yet lately they d had one quarrel after another , usually over something so fling he could not remember what had started it . And the last e they had met Will had said , " I 'm going home . I 'm not ing to argue with you . You know everything , anyway . " Had n't that been one of the first things Will had said to him : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ought that Will had admired that in him , that that was a good it , not a bad one . How had that changed ? Should he pretend be as ignorant as Will 's foolish friends ? Most of them had n't en been able to graduate from the universities their fathers sent them to . lie wondered , though , if Will objected to something else . ill had said several times that Geoffrey disliked it when he ent to visit Christopher , that his brother had threatened to tell eir father . " And my father , " Will had said , " has warned me often enough about the sin of Sodom . " Will 's father had been the one who had said that unbelievers brought the plague upon themselves , Christopher rememred . He thought the man must be a singularly joyless individual . " The sin of Sodom , " he said . " I always wondered what the n of Gomorrah would be . And if I would enjoy it . " 194 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Will had n't laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could disown me if he knew what I 've been doing . And Geoffrey might just tell him , out of  --  out of meanness , perhaps , or perhaps he wants to inherit everything . " " Your brother , " Christopher said , remembering a quoted line of poetry , " does not sound like a very pleasant person . " " Nay , " Will had said , and Christopher had wondered , as he wondered from time to time around Will , how much the other man knew . Now , going up the steps to the Ryders ' manor , he thought about Geoffrey again . Would the man truly disown his brother ? What would happen to Will then ? Well , perhaps it would be good for him , show him how everyone else had to live . But what would he do ? How would he survive ? He knocked on the door and the elderly servant let him in . Geoffrey came to greet him . " Where 's Will ? " Christopher asked . " He 's not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you if he was here . I asked you where he was . " " Ah . I was getting to that . He 's gone to France . " " France ? " Christopher felt as if he had walked into a room he believed was solid and felt the floor give way beneath him . " Why ? " For a moment , he saw , Geoffrey had been tempted to give a hurtful answer : " To get away from you , " or some such reply . But then Geoffrey 's face changed and he saw that the other man was about to tell the truth , or what passed for the truth with him . " He 's gone to Rheims . To the Catholic seminary there . " At first Geoffrey 's answer made no sense at all , like a line of nonsense in a ballad . He tried to think . " To the ? But why ? " " I do n't know . Our father , " Geoffrey said , moving toward the door to signify that the interview was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyd sat in the room he shared with Christopher and stared at the piece of paper in front of him . He had gone to Bedlam earlier that day , intending to make that month 's payment for Arthur 's lodgings , but the steward told him that some- p 195 one had come for Arthur , a man claiming to be a relative . The steward had described the man but Tom could not think who he might be . A relative , though : that sounded promising . He hoped that Arthur was safe and well cared for . Tom sighed and looked around the room . Almost immediately after he and Christopher had taken the room he had begun to regret his decision . Sometimes Kit would come in for a few minutes , scribble something on a piece of paper and then leave . At other times he would stay on from morning to evening , lighting candles against the dark , covering pages and pages . To Tom , writing was a job like any other . He came in for the day and left when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit would feel the same way . But when he had questioned the other man about it Kit had only laughed . There were other problems as well . Christopher scattered papers throughout the room , letters and books and manuscripts . Once , on a day when he had felt dull and tired and Christopher had been off somewhere , Tom had sneaked a look at some of the pages . He had paid dearly for his sin , though , for what he had seen had been a poem so beautiful he had been unable to write for a week . And yet after that it seemed as if he could n't help himself : he read the poem guiltily every chance he got , watching as the story of the love between Hero and Leander took shape before him on the page . He knew that Kit wrote better poetry than he did ( though perhaps , if it was not boasting to say it , he liked to think that his own plays were better constructed ) , but it seemed unfair to have to be reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him and he looked around . Christopher stood there , back after an absence of several months . " Care to take a walk with me ? " he asked . That was another problem with sharing a room with Kit : sometimes , on the days he did n't feel like working , his friend would try to talk him into going out into London . " Nay , " Tom said , turning back to his work . " Where have you been ? " " Canterbury , " Christopher said , and Thomas nearly jumped from his seat . He would have sworn that the other man had been behind him , but somehow he had gone over to his desk 196 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | by the window . He seemed to move at a different pace than other people , though Tom noticed that when they walked together he went slowly , almost languidly . " Escaping the plague ? " " Visiting my family . Fighting a duel . " Like Thomas Nashe , Kyd sometimes wondered what his friend did in the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he probably did n't want to know . Back in January Christopher had told him a story about being arrested for counterfeiting in the Netherlands , and while Tom had n't disbelieved him exactly he had thought that for his own peace of mind he had better change the subject . Now he did the same . " The plague 's nearly over , they say . " " Aye . Let 's go . " " I 'm busy here . " " Come , we 'll be back in an hour . I promise . " " Nay . I know your hours . " " Two hours , then . You 're hungry , are n't you ? " He was . He had known from the first that he would n't be able to resist his friend . Sighing , he stood and carefully put away the pages he had written that day . He did n't think that Kit would want to read them , but then Kit probably thought the same of him . They went out into the street . A cool breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been right : he had needed to get outside for a few hours . On Cheapside a vagabond in torn and dirty clothing came toward them , a begging bowl held out in his hands . " Masters , please , " he said . " A penny , a groat , anything you can spare . I 've been turned off my lands , my wife and children are dead of the plague ... " Kit moved past him , but Tom fumbled in his purse and dropped a coin in the bowl . " Thank you , master , thank you , kind sir , " the vagabond said , and moved on . Kit turned to Tom in astonishment . " You do n't believe that he was truly turned off his lands , do you ? Or any of those other lies he told you ? " Tom shrugged . " What if he was ? "  | " What if he was n't ? " " He was suffering " Oh , aye . You write plays and you know nothing of dis-guises. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tom said , ignoring the other man . " That 's right , I forgot . You believe that goodness is re-warded . " Tom said nothing . He had learned over the years not to argue with his friend . Suddenly he noticed that they had gone past all the stalls and cookshops on Cheapside . " I thought we were going to eat , " he said . " Later . " " Where are you going ? " " Paul 's . " " Paul 's ? " Tom said , hurrying after him . " Why ? " " I heard that Robin 's book has come out . The last one . His deathbed confession . " Tom had heard of Robert 's book too . Folks whispered that it was filled with scandal , with revelations about poor Robin 's life and his last hours . If the book had truly appeared it would be worth postponing his meal for a few hours . He should have known that Kit had had something planned , that he would not be getting back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exciting always happened whenever he went out with his friend ; he wondered how the man could stand an entire diet of it . They went inside the churchyard . Tom had never seen so few people there , had never heard it so quiet ; the plague still kept most folks indoors . Kit nodded to some of the stationers as they passed but did not talk to any of them ; it seemed he would not he moved from his original purpose . Suddenly , though , he stopped and pointed across the yard . " Is that ? Aye , there he is . Look , quickly , it 's Gabriel Harvey ! " Tom followed his gaze . A middle-aged man with large quantities of lace at his neck and wrists was making his way slowly through the courtyard . As they watched he adjusted his cloth-198 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | ing , patted down his jerkin , smoothed his mustache and then walked off with a satisfied air . " Doctor Harvey ! " Kit said , shouting across the yard . " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to wish him good day . Do n't you want to talk to him ? " " Of course not . Why should I involve myself in Tom Nashe 's silly feud ? I do n't even know the man . " " Time you got acquainted , then . " Gabriel Harvey saw them at that moment . " Doctor Harvey ! " Kit said again , but the other man seemed as reluctant to meet as Tom was . He turned and almost ran out of the yard . Kit laughed for a long time . " The terrible Doctor Harvey , " he said finally . " I wonder why it is he angers Tom so . Why does he waste his time with that man ? " " One of those trifling feuds that neither one can finish , I suppose . Let 's get what we came for and go . " But Kit had one more stop to make , at Edward Blount 's stall . There he talked to the publisher about the poem he was writing , assuring the other man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more time to work on it . Tom listened a little enviously . No one had ever been that interested in his poems . His hunger returned , and while the two men talked he browsed through the books on the neighboring stall . " Look , Kit , " he said . " Nashe 's book . Pierce Penniless . " " Aye , and we 'll take that one too , " Kit said , breaking away from his conversation . He took sixpence out of his purse and gave it to a pleasant-looking woman at the stall . Where does he get his money ? Tom thought . He had heard rumors of a wealthy patron . They went by William Wright 's stall and picked up Greene ' s Groatsworth of Wit , heard talk of another book called The Repentance , bought that one too , and then made their way out of the churchyard . Just as they were leaving Tom Nashe came in through the entrance . " We just saw your friend Harvey , " Kit said . " If you hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashe said , and to Tom Kyd 's surprise he looked a  | tic uneasy . " I do n't  --  I 've said everything I had to say to him d his brother Richard in my book . That book , " he said , point-g to Pierce Penniless in Kit 's hand . " I hear he came to London st to write his reply to me . Came in the middle of the plague , while thousands died all around him . " He laughed . " Are you thirsty ? Come , let 's go to a tavern and look at the books we bought . " " Groatsworth of Wit , " Nashe said , noticing it for the first w . " I doubt you 'll like that one , Kit . " " Why not ? " " Ah . You 'll see for yourself . " They made for a tavern close by that Nashe knew . Tom Kyd ought that this was the first time they had all been together months , perhaps in years , and that it had taken Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with their ork and their patrons , and over the years they had drifted part . And Kit and Tom Nashe had had some sort of falling out , ough he did n't know the details : Kit had told him only that he thought Nashe had lost his wits . Maybe poor Robin would work ' me good , then , especially if his book made Kit think over his life . The Repentance : it seemed a promising title . ' They were the only ones in the tavern . Most folk avoided crowded places during the plague and the host approached cm a little cautiously , as if afraid they might be infected . Tom yd was finally able to order his meal . Nashe leafed through the books they had brought . " First in all your actions set God before your eyes , ' " he read a solemn voice . " A Puritan ! " Kit said . He reached for the book but Tom Nashe moved it away and continued reading . . . . for the fear of the Lord is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book from him . He turned a page and read a little to himself , and Tom Kyd saw his face change . " What is it ? " he asked . " Wonder not , ' " Kit read , " that Greene , who hath said with thee ( like the fool in his heart ) , There is no God , should now give glory unto His greatness ? ' " 200 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Is he writing about you ? " Tom Kyd asked . " Aye . " His face had grown intent , almost hard . There was no other sound in the room . " Listen . Why should thy excellent wit , His gift , be so blinded , that thou shouldst give no glory to the giver ? ' " He looked down the page . " Defer not ( with me ) till this last point of extremity ; for little knowst thou how in the end thou shalt be visited . ' Oh , the hypocrite ! Oh , the damned wretched hypocrite ! " " He deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you know about this ? " Kit asked . Nashe nodded . Tom Kyd thought that just once in his life he would like to have heard some piece of news before the other man . " The printer told me a few days ago . Robin was not like this when I dined with him , I assure you . " Kit began to read again . " Sweet boy , might I advise thee , be advised , and get not many enemies by bitter words . . . ' You are the sweet boy , I take it . Had he lost his wits when he wrote this ? " " Does he mention me ? " Tom Kyd asked . Kit laughed suddenly . " You ? Nay , it seems he overlooked you . The only playwright in London , I fear . " He looked down the page . " Who is this here ? An upstart Crow , beautified with our feathers . . . the only Shake-scene in a country . ' " " I think I met him once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write plays . Shake  --  Shakes something . I ca n't remember now . " Kit pushed back his thick hair and paged through the book . Tom Nashe picked up The Repentance . " It is better to die repentant than to live dishonest , ' " he read in his Puritan 's voice , seeming anxious to fill up the silence . " Aye , and best of all to do both , it seems , " Kit said , looking up from his book . " How can you mock the dead ? " Tom Kyd said . " Mock him ? He mocks me , and from the grave , too , where he 's safe from my answer . What did he think I would do when I read this , change my ways ? Nay , I 'm certain that he did n't think of me at all . " " What will you do ? " Tom Nashe said . p 201 " Do ? Nothing . What should I do ? " " Harry Chettle saw this through the press after Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him and demand an apology , demand he publish something , I do n't know ... " Kit looked at him levelly and he stopped . " Why ? " " So that ? What he says here is dangerous , Kit . If everyone in London knows your views you could be arrested , or ? " " Nay , nothing will happen to me . " " You do n't know that . Come , we 'll go to him together ? " " Nay . Let it stand . " " But people will think ? " " Let them . I do n't care . " Tom Kyd saw with surprise that Kit meant it , that if he had been angry a moment ago it had passed . He thought that he would never understand the man , not if he knew him for a hundred years . The talk changed ; now Kit and Tom Nashe were going over all that had happened since they had seen each other last . It seemed that Kyd would have to hear the story about counterfeiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Netherlands to begin with ? " Tom Nashe asked . " Someone there wanted to publish some translations I did , a book of Ovid 's poetry . I met up with a goldsmith , a man who said he could show me how to make coins . I was curious to see it , and I went with him . And the authorities caught up with us , and I was sent back to England . " He laughed . " But why should you want to make coins ? " Tom Kyd asked . " Why ? Think of it , man ! If I could make my own money I would never have to bow to a patron again . Or change a scene for an actor who did n't understand what I 'd written , or write a pretty dedication that came to nothing ... " Was he serious ? Tom Kyd knew that his friend often said things only for the effect they had . He tried to keep his face impassive , tried not to let Kit see that his talk had shocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Kit turned to him and said , " Well , why should n't I ? I have as good a right to coin as the queen of England . " 202 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | A few days later Tom Kyd sat at his desk and tried to concentrate on the work before him . Christopher was out some-where  --  God knew where  --  and Tom had given in to temptation once more and read what he had added to his poem . But when he 'd turned back to his own play it had seemed awkwardly written , each word leaden and colorless . He sighed and looked around . Kit had left the books he 'd bought , balanced precariously on top of a stack of other books and manuscripts , and Tom stood and went over to look at them . He picked up Nashe 's Pierce Penniless and began to page through it . Almost at once he came to what Tom had written about Gabriel Harvey 's brother Richard . " Thou great baboon , thou pygmy braggart , thou pamphleteer of nothing . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrash thee mightily . " Were these insults a fit subject for a writer ? Apparently so , apparently , as Greene had shown , one could write a book about anything . Kyd read on in amazement , coming to Nashe 's words on Richard Harvey 's book The Lamb of God : " I could not refrain but bequeath it to the privy , leaf by leaf as I read it , it was so ugly , dorbellical and lumpish . Monstrous , monstrous . . . not to be spoken of in a Christian congregation ... " Robert Greene had been right : Nashe could only make enemies with these words . Robert had been right about a great many things , Tom Kyd thought ; both the men he had mentioned could profit from his words , if only they would listen . But nay , they were too fond of their follies , each of them . He could not help but wish , though , that Robert had said something about him . It was foolish , he knew , but he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the playwrights in it would be discussed for years to come . If , God forfend , he should die now of the plague , would any remember him in even ten years ' time ? Nay , this was nonsense . Fame meant nothing ; it was important only to live a modest , sober , industrious life . In ten years ' time these men might be dead of their follies , dead or suffering some other punishment sent by God . Already God had seen fit p 203 to take away one of their number . But if he lived properly and safely , taking care to keep away from all their excesses , he would not share their fate . Satisfied , he went back to his work , and wrote until the light faded .  | Paul Hogg looked up from his stack of books . Arthur sat slumped against the wall like one of the boneless creatures ; Hogg knew that he could stay there for hours , getting up only two or three times a day . He had spent the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentle voice and waiting patiently for an answer . The red king had sent messengers to collect Arthur but Hogg had put them off . He thought that he would never get another chance like this one , and he was anxious to learn what Arthur knew . He turned a page of the book in front of him . " The end of alchemy is in celebration , reconciliation , the marriage of the red man and the white lady ... " he read . What did that mean ? He understood , of course , that writers on alchemy could not speak clearly about what they knew , that this knowledge had to be kept secret , hidden from the multitudes . Still , he wished that the books could be a little more forthcoming . Most alchemists thought the words referred to sulphur and quicksilver , but he had tried those substances in his last experiment and nothing had happened . The red man was blood , perhaps , and the white lady was then  --  what ? Milk ? p 205 Nay , it was ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed the eleventh alchemical step , and he had stalled there , with no idea how to proceed . He had asked Arthur , but the other man had n't seemed to know . Perhaps Arthur was what George believed him to be , a lunatic , the half-mad son of Alice Wood in the churchyard . But the more he spoke to Arthur the more certain he became that the man 's silence hid knowledge , perhaps a vast knowledge . How could he take that knowledge away from him ? Maybe he had asked the wrong questions ; maybe he had been too elusive , like the books he read . What if Arthur only waited for an honest , forthright question  --  what if the secret of wisdom lay in openness , in revealing , not concealing ? Reveal , not conceal , he thought . It went against everything he knew . He decided to try it anyway : he had a few days , at best , before the king would force him to surrender Arthur . He moved to the floor and sat next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change lead into gold ? " he asked in a low voice . Arthur laughed but said nothing . The music seemed to play in his head again ; he moved his hand in time to it , up and down . A man who searched for the secrets of the alchemists learned patience , if nothing else . " Do you know how to make the Philosopher 's Stone ? " Hogg asked . " Aye . " " Aye ? " His heart beat faster ; he had been right . " How ? " Arthur looked directly at Hogg , his green eyes wide . " I can change lead into gold . Any king can . " " Here , " Hogg said , trying not to sound too eager . He went to the table and brought back a piece of lead . " Change that to gold , " he said , giving it to Arthur . Arthur took the lead and let it drop to the floor . He looked at Hogg again . " When will I see my family ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his guesses about Arthur was that the man was not a lunatic at all but a true son of Faerie , a child of either Oriana or the king . The guess made him happy ; he might have knowledge few other people had . It was not the need for wealth that made him search for the 206 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Philosopher 's Stone ; he had more than enough . If he wanted , he could move from this mean house to one of the manors by the riverside . It was knowledge , the idea that Nature had yielded up one more of her secrets . He needed the Stone to live forever , and he needed to live forever to learn everything there was to learn . " Who were your parents ? " he asked , hoping to take advan ? tage of Arthur 's sudden willingness to answer questions . " My father was a king . My mother was a queen . " " King of what ? " Arthur said nothing . Hogg looked at the wall , thinking of his next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump of lead was now shining gold . George woke , gasping . He had dreamed of something moving in his house , something stealthy and unwholesome . Now , as he lay still , he thought he could smell the odor of stagnant pools , of hot decaying marshland . He tried not to move . A silver ewer clattered to the floor . George clenched his teeth , trying not to cry out . " George , " a voice said . George could hear the thing 's difficulty in speaking though the pointed snout , the crooked teeth . George said nothing . " George , " the creature said again . " You must see to it that Paul Hogg gives us Arthur . He must not he allowed to keep him . " " Tell him yourself , " George said , and then cursed himself for replying . Now it would know where he was . But what could they do to him , after all ? Hogg had called them the creatures of light ; the night must limit their powers . The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach Hogg , that the man 's protective circles had served some purpose after all . They hoped to get to Hogg through him . " I 'll tell him , " he said . " Leave me alone , please . " He was ashamed to hear his voice tremble . " Ahhhh , " the creature said . Something else laughed . There were two of them then , two or more . " Please , " he said again . Wild laughter came from the darkness . He heard things being  | ih thrown through the room , stools and candlesticks and pewter lates . His table fell over heavily . What more did they want nom him ? He had already agreed to help them . " Then there was silence . He lay in the darkness for a long me , too frightened to get up and look at the shambles the matures had made of his room . Perhaps they were still there , waiting for him . He remembered what they had done to Anthony .

But would Hogg let him do that ? He as in this business too deeply already . And he did n't know the extent of the other man 's power : Hogg might call the lubbernds down on him , or change all his gold into coal , and then Where would he be ? The room began to lighten around him : dawn was coming . He rose and looked around .

He could not stay here , he thought , rising and putting on 208 LISA GOLDSTEIN STRANGE DEVICES OF THE SUN AND MOON 209  | fresh clothes .

He hurried down the streets , looking forward to the glow of firelight and good company . But when he got there he saw that the tavern was almost deserted ; fear of the plague had kept most people home . Only Edward Blount and a few other men sat at a table by the wall , talking in low voices . He joined them , calling to the serving-woman for more beer for everyone . One or two of the men gave him an expression he had come to know well , gratitude and envy and a sort of stupefied puzzlement . He knew what they thought : Why did he thrive while they had to struggle ? How had he come by his riches in the middle of a plague year ? As the serving-woman brought the drinks , though , he began to regret his generosity . He was still in debt , still struggling to find ways to pay his creditors .

" What else can they do during a plague season but read ? " " Aye , when even the whores are poxed , " one of the men said . A few of the others laughed . George frowned . He did not like to hear women talked of so insolently . " We should have revoked Mistress Wood 's membership when we had the chance , " one of the men said , drinking deeply .

Hungry and thick-headed from his fitful sleep , a little giddy from the beer , he wondered for the first time if Edward could be right after all . True , he had wen one of the fiends in her house , but they had come to his house as well ; they answered to Paul Hogg and they seemed to plague Anthony . Could Hogg be wrong about them ? Were they a l l the children of Cain , or were they something else , something outside Hogg 's philosophy ? He did n't know .

" She never said because it was no one 's business , " Edward said , angry now . " Because malicious gossips like yourself would be quick to make something evil of it . " " Something about her son , was n't it ? " the other man went on , unperturbed . " Whatever happened to him ? What kind of mother would misplace a son like that ?

Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men at the table began to talk at once . " Where ? " " How do you ? " " What ? " George thought quickly . He had allowed his doubts to get the better of him , had given in for a moment to sentimentality . 210 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | He called for another round of beer to cover his confusion . " I  --  I saw him on the streets a few days ago . " " Where ? " Edward asked . " Cheapside , I think . " " Did you tell Mistress Wood ? " " Nay , I  --  I thought he was headed for the churchyard . I did n't want to interrupt their meeting . " " I never saw him there . Are you certain you 're telling us everything you know ? " George nodded . He had been foolish , very foolish .

In a few days they would exchange Arthur for the secrets of the Philosopher 's Stone . Riches and eternal life  --  what could Alice , or anyone else , offer that would better that ? Alice opened her stall and set the books out in neat rows in front of her . Until she had married she had only known how to spell her own name . She had seen her brothers ( farmers now , all but the youngest , who had died of smallpox ) go off to the small village school , and she had never even thought to wonder what they did there , or what she was missing . Her mother needed help with the household , and she had to learn the arts that would get her a husband : sewing , cooking , cleaning . When she married John , though , she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her family had had the Geneva Bible and nothing else , and even that had disappeared during the reign of Queen Mary . They had thought books strange , almost foreign , like the tobacco brought from the New World . At first John read aloud to her each night , books of romance and voyages of discovery , plays in which he p 211 took each of the parts in turn . Then , over her reluctance , he began to teach her to read . She had had no idea of the kinds of things to be found in books : recipes , and how to cure wounds , and histories , and old poems . All the knowledge of the world was there ; she had only to turn back a cover and she would be transported to some other place and time . Now she found it almost amusing that the stationers had accused her of witchcraft : they themselves practiced a kind of magic no witch could ever equal . She picked up a book and paged through it . Usually the press of business kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed away from the churchyard and she had time for luxuries like this one . She admired the neat rows of the letters , like a plowed field , the vellum binding , the way the whole thing was stitched together . Her printer may have been rude and surly but he did good work ; everyone agreed on that . A shadow fell over her stall and she looked up . Edward stood there , looking worried . " I talked to George yesterday , " he said . " He said he 's seen Arthur . " " Arthur ! ' Where ? " " On Cheapside . He said he did n't tell you because he thought Arthur was going to meet you . " " I never saw him . " " Nay . There 's something George is n't telling us . I never trusted that man . " " I think  --  I think he wants Arthur too . He and that friend of his , that man in black . What if they 've found him ? What will they do to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the queen . I heard Arthur was involved with that plot , the attempt on her life ? " Alice nodded , not trusting herself to speak . Edward knew George , but he did n't know Oriana and the red king . George could do worse things than give Arthur to Queen Elizabeth . She looked across the churchyard and watched as George set out his books . Then she turned back to Edward and began to close up her stall . It was time to visit Margery . * * * 212 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Agnes opened the door to Margery 's cottage . After the battle she had stayed on to help Margery with her work . Her husband was dead , she had explained , and she had little to do in the village in any case , since many of the farmers had moved to London . As always the woman annoyed her ; Alice 's own husband had died as well , but she had n't run to Margery asking to be taken in . Still , Agnes had proved useful to Margery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage . And as the plague had worsened she and Margery worked day and night , mixing medicine to bring to those who were stricken . " George says he 's seen Arthur , " Alice said . Margery looked up at that . She had been stirring something in a large pot , and some of it , a brown sticky paste , had found its way into her hair . " Did he say anything else ? " " He does n't talk to me , you know that . But I 'm afraid that they 've found him , that they 'll ? " " If they 've found Arthur you can be sure he 's with Hogg , not George , " Margery said , talking more to herself than Alice . " 1 know he would not let Arthur out of his sight . And Hogg has lived in one squalid house or another for as long as I 've known him . Still , he might have moved since I last saw him . " She brushed her hair out of her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Then she glanced around the room . The large ginger cat mewed . Margery nodded and went toward it . The scrying ball lay on the floor near the cat , and Marge picked it up and looked at it critically . Dust and cat fur covered the ball and she took a cloak from a nearby stool and wiped it clean . Then she set it on a table and gazed into it . The room grew silent . Alice looked at Agnes , puzzled , but the other woman watched Margery with no expression at all on her face . Margery did not dabble in magic , Alice knew that . And yet she had had the scrying ball for as long as Alice could remember . Was it possible that she had been mistaken about her friend , that she had been wrong to defend her against charges of witchcraft ? Suddenly Margery stepped back . Arthur appeared in the glass , but Arthur as Alice had never seen him , dirty , thin , his  | clothes torn and his beautiful red hair matted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And why did n't you use the glass to discover him before ? " " Hush , " Margery said . " I used the glass when he first disappeared , but he had gone beyond my power to see him , to  --  to country I did n't know . I had n't known that he 'd returned . " Hogg came into view as they watched . They saw him sit next to Arthur and say something . " I wish we could hear them talk , " Agnes said . " He 's asking Arthur questions , " Margery said . " He 's after knowledge , as always . " " But Arthur does n't know anything ! " Alice said . He knows more than you may think , " Margery said . " He has powers you have never seen , though he 's had no way to learn how to use them . " In the glass , Hogg stood and moved out of their view . Arthur nodded his head as if in time to music . " I know that room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look  --  he studies alchemy . " She laughed harshly . Alice could not see what had so amused her friend . " How do e get him away ? " " I do n't know . We 'll have to go there and see . " " Now ? It 's almost evening . " " Aye , and that 's why we have to leave now . I 'm certain that rthur is guarded , and his guards will be weaker at night . " " Then it 's true what Hogg said  --  that Oriana 's people are the children of darkness , the children of Cain ? " Margery said nothing . " Why do you have to do everything in darkness ? " Alice said , determined to get an answer from her friend . " And what kind of magic is it that lets you see Arthur in at glass ? I 've told the Stationers ' Company that you 're not a itch , and now I find ? " " What kind of magic ? How many kinds are there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply .

" " I do n't know . Because Hogg gave him the sight , I 'd guess . " " Nay . Hogg holds as fast to his knowledge as a miser to hi gold . " " Someone else gave it to him , then .

" " And more and more people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alice could think of nothing to say . As always Margery 's idea were as outlandish as anything she had ever heard . Agn nodded slowly , as if she understood all the other woman ha said . Maybe she did . But what did it matter ? The important thing was to get Arthur , after all . Margery left food for the cats , stopping to talk softly t the large ginger torn , and then they set off . Margery led them through Ludgate and past Paul 's . A tree stood by the gate to the churchyard , and Margery stopped an placed her hand on the trunk . Alice remembered that the tre had flourished there all summer despite the drought , and sa that even now , in the fall , it had kept most of its leaves . Marge spoke a few muttered words , and Alice felt her uneasiness return . They went down Cheapside . The sun was setting as the turned left at the Mercers ' Hall and left again into a part o London Alice had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill wind whistled past them . Garbage filled the streets , and a few rats , made bold by the absence of people , rail from one pile to the next . Was it safe for the three of them to come here ? Without discussing it they moved closer , huddlin together in the center of the street . Margery stopped before a house as rundown as its neighbors.  | I ) id she remember which house it was after all these years ? And even if she did , what did she plan to do now ? Knock politely and ask for Arthur back ? No sound came from inside the house . Margery tried the latch but the door was locked . " Arthur , " she said softly . " Open the door . " " His guards wo n't let him come to the door , surely . " " Quiet . Arthur , open the door . Arthur , do you hear me ? " To her surprise Alice heard footsteps come to the door , and then the sound of a key turning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Alice barely had time to get over her shock  --  Arthur , after all these years ! ? when one of the sea-creatures dropped from the rafters . She cried out and backed into the street , but Arthur only watched the thing incuriously . Margery spoke a few words and made some signs in the air . The creature bared its teeth and padded toward her . Margery flung her arm in front of her face and shouted to it . Now even Agnes looked worried , her hands twisting in the folds of her dress . The thing hissed and moved closer . Its claw drew blood from Margery 's arm . Alice heard herself say something : " Go away ! Get out ! " but still it came on . A loud wind blew past them . Margery screamed against it , her clothes blowing out behind her . The creature stopped and hissed angrily . Margery spoke again . The wind howled . Then , in the time it took Alice to blink , the sea-creature disappeared . The wind died down . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it : " Nay , I wo n't go with them ! Nay , she 's not my mother ! " The signs that Margery had made in the air still glowed in the evening light , the color of silver . " Come , " Margery said . " We must leave before it returns . " " I wo n't go with her , " Arthur said , quieter now . " She 's not my mother . " " Nay , she 's not , " Margery said . " Your mother is Oriana , Queen of the Fair Folk . " " Queen ... " Arthur said . Alice could see him struggle with the new idea ; although he had somehow known that he was n't her son he could never have been completely sure . His pleasure 216 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | at being a queen 's son won out over his uncertainty . Alice saw the delight that appeared on his face and felt that something had been taken from her . Why had Margery told him the truth now ? Alice had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriana . But nay , she had best get used to the idea that she would lose him . Lose him and gain another , her true son . What would he be like ? " When will I see her ? " Arthur asked eagerly . " Soon , " Margery said . " He said that too . But he would never let me go  --  that thing always guarded the door for him . " " Aye , and we must hurry before it comes back . " But Arthur made no move to go . Perhaps he did n't understand the danger he was in ; perhaps he thought that Margery would be no different from Hogg . " He would have given you to the red king , not to Oriana , " Margery said . " And the king would have used you in the battle he fights with your mother 's people . " Lulled by the promise of learning more secrets Arthur followed Margery as she moved down the street . Probably Hogg had told him nothing at all . Margery began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had spoken the truth when she 'd said that the thing might return . As they went she told him the story of his birth , how he had been exchanged for a human baby , Alice 's son . He ignored Alice , the faerie-light shining from his face as he listened , enchanted , to the other woman . And when will I get my son back ? Alice wondered . Over the next few weeks Alice thought about visiting Margery , but always the memory of the evening they had rescued Arthur stopped her . Her friend did n't dabble in magic ; Alice had known that as certainly as she knew the titles of the books she sold . And yet Margery had used a scrying glass , had spoken words to keep the creature away from them , had possibly even raised the wind she had felt at the end . Nothing was as it seemed to be ; her friend was truly a witch and Alice had lied to George and the Stationers ' Company . Had Margery sold her soul to the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still she thought of the other woman a dozen times a day . She missed the talks they had had . And she wanted to see Arthur again ; he had looked so thin , so frail , that night he 'd come to the door . What kind of mother would let her only child fall into that state ? But Arthur was not her son , and no doubt Margery and Agnes , with their knowledge of herbs , could restore him better than she could . So the weeks passed . Alice waited for a summons from Margery , a message telling her the day they would meet with Oriana , but it never came . Her business prospered : she sold all her copies of Tom Nashe 's book and had to order another printing . And then Gabriel Harvey replied to Nashe in his Four Letters and Certain Sonnets , and Nashe told her that he was hard at work on an answer to Harvey in a pamphlet called Strange News . She wondered that men with so much talent would waste their time on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book was very funny . When Harvey tried for wit he could not touch him , and Tom knew it . It was a good season for the stationers . Scandals and gossip swept through the churchyard , a welcome diversion after the grim deaths of the previous summer . All the pamphleteers in London seemed to be engaged in a war of words , but the printers and booksellers were the only winners , and Alice profited as much as any . In December Henry Chettle , who had prepared Greene 's Groatsworth of Wit for the press , came out with his own book , Kind Heart 's Dream . In it he apologized to one of the playwrights Greene had insulted , the man Greene had called Shake-scene , but not to Nashe or Marlowe . Alice had recognized Marlowe the day he bought Nashe 's book , and she had thought that he did not look like the kind of man who would ask for an apology . And Tom Nashe wrote day and night in order to finish his answer to Harvey and had no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back from her dinner to find another of the stationers looking through Pierce Penniless , chuckling as he read . " You can borrow it if you like , " she said . All of the booksellers frequently lent their books to one another . The man had n't seen her come up . He set the book down 218 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | quickly , then raised one hand to his breast and lowered it . Alice thought he might have been about to cross himself . He turned and backed away , stumbling a little in his eagerness to be gone . Alice watched him as he went . Her neighbor Edward Blount watched him too , she noticed ; she realized he must have seen the whole thing . Suddenly angry , she said , " Does he think it beneath his dignity to speak to a woman ? " " Nay , you know it 's not that , " Blount said . " Aye , it 's worse than that . They still think I practice witch-craft . " " You should not talk to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone I please . Margery 's my friend . " " Then you should not expect the stationers to listen to you . They know that she 's a witch , and if you keep company with her they will think the same of you . " " She 's not ? " Alice started to say . " Not a witch ? Do you truly believe that ? " Alice said nothing . She could not make that claim , not now . She set Nashe 's book back on its pile , feeling melancholy . If it were not for Edward and Walter , she thought , she would have no one to speak to in the churchyard . She knew that Georg whispered against her , and she thought that his accusation must be having some effect . Folks listened to George ; his business had prospered and he had become one of the most influential members of the company . Now she looked over at Walter 's stall . The city authority had declared the danger from plague over and had reopened the playhouses at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold and the rain to return to the Theatre and th Curtain in Shoreditch . Their talk was limited to the plays the saw and the business of the company , and she sometimes thought that she could learn to regard him as a friend and it ( as a man she could love . Then he would smile or say something witty , and she would feel herself catch fire again . Still , she could not help but wonder why he had stuck by h Perhaps he had some flaw in his character that made him de the rest of the stationers , the same flaw she herself must ha had in order to have stayed so long with Margery . They we 220 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | George said nothing . At best , he thought , Hogg would cast him off , would no longer give him money from his supply of gold coins . And he needed those coins to keep his business : he owed too many people money , had spread himself far too thin . Yet he thought he would gladly brave poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or worse . Anthony grinned . " The pox take you , why are you laughing ? " Hogg said , turning to him . George realized that Hogg was genuinely angry now . He had never faced the man 's anger , had never seen him lose his careful control , and he felt terrified . " I 'll  --  I can watch her for you , " George said . " I see her every day at the churchyard . " " Do you think she has n't been watched ? Do you think I 'm that foolish ? She 's spied on every minute , she and that demon of hers . She does n't have Arthur . " " She does n't ? Then where is he ? " " Margery has him . And I do n't know where Margery is . She 's clever at hiding , I 'll give her that . " " Well , then , I could ?

Either one might be tempted by the red king 's vast power ; he knew that he could not let down his guard ft a moment in their presence . Though Anthony , of course , was far more dangerous than George . His desire for knowledge and wealth was too great ; he burned with the need for it . He had to be kept on a tight rein , , given only so much information and money and no more . Even now , Hogg knew , Anthony sometimes reverted to his former p 219 Two of a kind , then , outcasts among the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his stall a few yards past Walter 's .

His unterfeit friend . She laughed a little , harshly , and turned back her books . Anthony Drury had delivered the summons to meet with Hogg earlier that day . Now , as George entered Hogg 's cramped room , he saw Anthony sitting at the large table with Hogg . He It briefly angry . It was bad enough to be humiliated ; to have t humiliation conducted in front of Anthony would be even worse . Then he remembered why Hogg had sent for him , and fear drove out all his other thoughts . " Did you tell anyone that we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ? Perhaps he did n't know ; perhaps was only guessing . George shook his head . " Come , George , " Hogg said . " Lying will not help you here . You boasted to your friends , did n't you ? " Anthony Drury watched them both , his eyes burning eagerly . " I told a few men from the churchyard , " George said finally . y had he ever opened his mouth , why had he let his ancient ing for Alice overcome all his good sense ? It did n't pay to be understanding ; it was not good policy . " But they did n't take him ? they could n't ? " " Nay , they could n't . But someone told Alice , and Alice 's end , that Margery , certainly could . Did n't you think of that ? " " You have not been helpful to me at all , George .

"  | profession of counterfeiter and debased the gold coins Hogg gave him . George , on the other hand , George might be harmless . Hogg gave him all the gold he desired ; his ambitions , so far , had been modest ones . He knew Anthony resented the fact that he favored George , that George prospered while Anthony lived in near-poverty . And Hogg encouraged this resentment , honored George in little ways , so that the two of them would not join forces and study without him . Not that he truly thought they had the wit to do that . Hogg had met only one other person whose learning he admired , whose talents he envied . Five years ago , when he had first come to London , when he had seen that the Fair Folk were moving and had been moved himself to follow them , he had become acquainted with Margery and had asked to study with her . But she had refused him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't understood her then and he did n't now : what difference did it make how he achieved his end ? She had claimed to be appalled at that . He should not have lost his temper with George and Anthony , should not have let them see his control slip . And he should not think so much of Margery : she was a woman and suffered from a woman 's weaknesses . Her limited thinking would keep her from doing truly great work . He opened a book on the table in front of him and looked down the page . " It is in the marriage of the red man and the white lady that the Philosopher 's Stone is born , " he read . What did that mean ? Why did all the authors of antiquity understand it , everyone but him ?  | The plague returned that spring .

As it passed he saw the five or six bodies winding-sheets piled on top of each other . Other than driver , still ringing his bell , he was the only living soul on street . Once again , Tom thought , he had not managed to find a w to leave London . He knew that Christopher had gone to the country with his patron , Thomas Walsingham , and he could help but resent him for it . Kit had sent Walsingham the parts his poem he had finished and had received an invitation Ant immediately . By that time , though , the two writers were ty longer sharing the room . Harsh words had been exchanged , the cause of which Tom could no longer remember . It had ? grown too much : the other man 's mysterious absences , w blasphemous speech , the diversions that seemed to come just when Tom was sitting down to write . Still , Tom wished h could have read the rest of the poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inn and paused to read it : You , strangers , that inhabit this land , Note this same writing , do it understand . Conceive it well , for safeguard of your lives , Your goods , your children , and your dearest wives . I le could make little of it , only that someone wanted the foreigners out of England . The author of the ballad had even veil a date for the strangers to leave : July 9 . Tom knew that the rge number of people who had come to London had caused struggle for the jobs that existed , and that some thought the ty would be better off without folks coming in from other countries as well . But perhaps the plague would keep the allad 's threat from being fulfilled . Torn hoped so , anyway ; he d not like to see men come to blows , except in the controlled aces of the stage . Once he reached his chamber , though , he ut the matter out of his mind and began to work . few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before he could get up to open the door two men came uninvited , one tall and plump , with a heavy blond mustache , the other small and dark , with a face that reminded Tom of a easel . " We have orders from the queen 's Star Chamber , " the shorter c said . " Aye ? " Tom said , standing . He had done nothing wrong , he ew that , and yet he still felt himself grow cold at the other man 's words . Anyone might have misunderstood something he d said , or taken his friends ' opinions for his own . But he d n't been to the taverns in several months ; he had stopped going about the same time Christopher left . The tall man picked up Tom 's manuscript and looked rough it .

Foolishly , Tom found himself wondering if the man liked it . " Sir Edmund Tillney , the Master of the Revels , had to sup . press some of that play , " Dick said , ignoring the other man . " H told us six people had a hand in it . " " I did n't write it . I told you . " " The part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted around the city about the French and Flemish settlers ? " The taller man had finished rooting through his papers and moved to Christopher 's old desk . It was hard to listen to Die and keep an eye on him at the same time . " Aye , " Tom said little belatedly , glad that he could give Dick the answer he wanted . " The queen wants her new subjects to be happy here . They 've suffered enough persecution from the Catholics al ? ready . Would n't you say so ? " " Aye . " Where was all this leading ? " We 're to find the folks responsible for posting those ballads . Someone suggested it might have been you . " " Nay , it was n't ? " " Do you know who it might have been ? " Tom thought . If he could come up with a name , he knew , the men would probably go away . But he could not bring himself to accuse anyone . He shook his head . " You 'll tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tom said . The taller man lifted a page from the desk . " And Jesus Christ which was born of Mary is not counted God with me , ' " he said , reading slowly .  | God 's blood , what was that ? Something Christopher had written , or had paid to have copied . Whatever it was it was dangerous , very dangerous . Why had he left it here ? Dick turned to the other man quickly . " Let me see that . " The tall man came over and gave him the manuscript . " What does this mean ? " Dick asked . " Not counted God with me ? ' " Tom 's heart beat very fast . He could not seem to gather his thoughts . " I do n't know . " " Where is it from ? " " I do n't know . " " You do n't know , " Dick repeated flatly . " Who would know , then ? This is your room , is n't it ? " " Aye , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Nay . I shared this room with another man . " Dick 's eyes narrowed with interest . Tom saw that he had been foolish , very foolish . " Who ? " Dick asked . " Several people , really . I ca n't remember them all . " It sounded weak to him . The other man must have thought so too , because he said , " You shared a room with them and ca n't remember their names ? " " Aye . There were many of us . " " But who would have had a manuscript like this one ? And why did n't he take it with him when he left ? " " I do n't know . " " Look here , John , " Dick said to the taller man . " See how fine the handwriting is . You have a fine hand too , Master ? " He looked down at his piece of paper again . " ? Master Kyd . " " I was a scrivener . " Tom said quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to copy it . " " Aye ? It looks like your handwriting to me . What do you think , John ? " " Aye , to me too . " " Nay , I ? " " Such things are easy enough to check , " Dick said . Were they ? How would they find out something like that ? But however they did it they would discover that he was innocent , and that was the important thing . 226 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Aye , " John said . " The rack . " " Nay ! " Tom said , backing away . " Nay , I told you it 's not mine . Do n't ? Please ? " " Whose is it , then ? " " I do n't ? " " Whose ? " " A man named  --  named Christopher Marlowe . A play-wright . " Both men looked interested at the word " playwright . " " And where is this man now ? " " With his patron , Thomas Walsingham . " Once the words had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent . I do n't know exactly where  --  I have n't seen him for months . Years , really . " Dick picked up Tom 's pen and began to write something on his piece of paper . " Kent , did you say ? " Despite himself Tom felt relieved . They would go after Christopher and leave him alone . Kit could explain the doctrinal complexities in the manuscript ; he knew how to argue theology , after all . And perhaps no harm would come to him ; to hear the man tell it he had been in worse situations than this one . Tom moved toward his desk , eager to return to his work . " We 'll have to take you with us , of course , " Dick said . " What ? Where ? " " To Bridewell . " " Bridewell ? But  --  but I 've told you everything I know . " " Have you ? Torture 's best for that , I 've heard . " Tom looked toward the window . He could run , escape them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where could he hide ? But his hesitation gave the bigger man time to seize his arm and turn him roughly , then pinion both arms behind his back . The man tightened his hold , forcing Tom toward the door and outside . Tom nearly cried out in pain . The streets were empty ; nothing moved . London looked like the painted backdrop representing the city of Rome that Tom had once seen in a play . No one was there to watch his humiliation as his captors led him toward the prison ; he felt grateful for that , if nothing else . Dogs nosed through the piles of garbage p 227 in the streets , and squeaking rats , bold enough now to appear in daylight , scurried on ahead of them . The two men led him through Ludgate and down Fleet Street for a little while , then turned south , toward the river . Tom had never seen Bridewell and could not help but notice how large it was , covering nearly the same area as Paul 's . Once inside his keepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hook and led him into a large common room holding a dozen people . At other prisons , Tom had heard , a bribe to the jailer ensured better lodgings and plentiful food . There was less corruption here , then , but that fact did not work to his benefit . He realized , almost despairing , that that was the kind of thought a ! criminal would have . A few prisoners looked up incuriously as he came in , then looked away , staring at nothing . Tom felt revulsion at the sight of them . Cutpurses and horse-thieves , he thought . And what am I ? Not a criminal , though , not that . I 've done nothing wrong . The jailer left . Men and women in the blue uniform of inmates passed through the common room on their way to the tasks assigned them . From where he stood Tom could see a large courtyard , where prisoners worked at grinding corn or heating hemp . They wo n't have me working , then , Tom thought . Nay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place to sit against a wall . The wall was stained and filthy ; probably countless people had rubbed against it over the years . No one spoke , either to him or to one another . One man sang a ballad until someone else threatened him with his fist . They all seemed spiritless , content to wait out the months or years they had to serve . An hour later one of the jailers came to fetch him . Nay , not a jailer  --  he was too well dressed , and he carried himself like a man of authority . Someone sent from the Star Chamber , then . 1 ie went with the man without question , even allowed himself a grudging hope . They 've realized the mistake they 've made , he thought . They 're going to let me go . The man turned a corner and went through a doorway , and Tom followed . At first he thought that the room held only a table , and he wondered why it should be so lacking in furniture . Then he 228 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ready for him , both his keeper and the man who tended the machine . They forced him down and tied his legs to the foot of the table and his arms up over his head . Nothing in his life had ever made him feel so helpless , so exposed . The torturer took his place at the head of the table . Tom tried to look at him , hoping to guess by his expression what might be coming next , but they had tied him so that he could see nothing . " Is this manuscript yours ? " the man from the Star Chamber asked from somewhere near his feet . " Nay , I told you ? " He gasped . A sharp pain traveled along his arms and legs . At first he could not grasp what had happened to him , and then he realized that the torturer had moved the wheel a little . " Is it yours ? " " Nay . " Another turn of the wheel . " It 's not ! I 've said ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The wheel turned again . His body felt on fire . Flames licked at his joints . Each point of agony was a star ; he had grown huge , as vast as the crystalline sphere of the heavens . " ? it 's Christopher 's , not mine , " he said . Had they even heard him ? It was difficult to speak against the pain , to make his voice carry from such a vast height . Another turn . Red-hot wires connected each of the stars burning in his joints . " Do you think us fools , then ? " the questioner said . " Why should we accept your story as true ? How do we know you shared a room with anyone ? " The torturer worked the wheel again . Tom collapsed inward , into a tight shell of pain smaller than a man 's hand . He could barely hear the questions . " Whose is it ? " It 's Christopher 's , he said , or thought he said . Christopher was the one responsible for the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint . The atheist , the blasphemer : they should summon the man and punish him for all his sins , punish him as Tom was being punished . And if they did n't he would see to it himself that the other man suffered . God 's justice would be done . p 229 " It 's Christopher 's ! " Tom cried . " He 's the one you want , not I ! " Then he fainted . The summons to appear before the Star Chamber did not worry Christopher overmuch . He had been called in front of various authorities in the past and had managed to talk himself out of worse situations . More troublesome , perhaps , was the idea of going to London during the plague season , but that could not be helped . He made his farewells to Thomas Walsingham 's household and rode to London with Henry Maunder , the man who had delivered the warrant for his arrest . They arrived in London by midafternoon , too late for that day 's meeting of the Star Chamber . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . He wandered through London with no goal in mind and found it deserted , the playhouses closed , Paul 's abandoned , the taverns empty . Hungry now , he made his way toward Cheapside , passing along the way three or four houses with quarantine notices posted on their doors . Best get this business over with and go hack to Kent , he thought . London 's no place for the living these days . A few stalls on Cheapside had remained open and he bought a meat pie and a bottle of ale . He had nearly finished eating when he heard whistling somewhere behind him , an eerie sound in the empty street . He turned . Will Ryder stood there , improbably dressed in a black cloak and tall black hat topped with a black plume . " Will ! " he said , embracing the other man . They stepped back , each regarding the other . Will looked thinner , less stocky , and had golden freckles across the bridge of his nose . His foolish hat had been knocked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least had n't changed . He looked very pleased , very certain of his welcome , and at that Christopher remembered where the man had been for almost a year . " I hear you 've turned Papist , " he said , and immediately regretted the coldness in his voice . " Nay , " Will said . " I was curious about them , nothing more . 230 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Come , let 's not talk theology just yet . Shall we go to my house Christopher followed the other man , his pulse quickening content for the moment to lay all questions aside . In the co manor they embraced again , more forcefully now . Christopher undid the other man 's cloak . " You 've lost your hat , " he sa softly . " I know , " Will said . Their lovemaking was hurried , almost desperate , as if C34 thought the other in danger of disappearing once more . l.at they did it again , slowly and languidly , then lay in Will 's I and talked . " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went  --  because of you , I think . " " Because of me ! " " Aye . You probably do n't know how you appeared to me Here you were , a poet , a playwright , a true spy , not a dabbler like myself  --  I began to think that there was nothing you had n't done . And then I remembered the scornful way you spoke the Catholics , and I thought that there at last was a place you had n't been . It took me three days in Rheims to discover that you had been there too . I felt that you were mocking me  --  that even in your absence you mocked me . " " I mocked you ? You were the one who told me in such superior fashion to use those outlandish Italian forks . " " Nay , I did n't ! " " What do you mean , you did n't ? Of course you did . " " I do n't remember . " " You did . What were they like , the Papists ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when I was there ? " " Nay , do n't jeer like that . They 're serious about their religion in a way that we 've lost , I think . And there 's a lot of good i them . We hear about the bad they do , but I wonder  --  I wonder how many of those stories are true . " " Most of them , I would think . " " I do n't think so . " Could Will be right ? The other man seemed so certain , and his old superior manner had returned , as if Christopher were an erring pupil . But what did it matter what Will thought of him ? p 231 Yet he found to his surprise that he was anxious for Will 's good opinion . " Why did you come back ? " he asked . " My father sent for me . He 'd disowned me after I went to Rheims  --  Geoffrey was quick to tell him what I 'd done . But when I came back to England he wrote and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what brings you to the city ? You 're the last person I expected to meet . " Christopher told him about the summons from the Star Chamber , what little information Henry Maunder had given him , making light of it so that Will would n't worry . Then , realizing only at that moment how good it was to confide in someone , he recounted all that had happened in the months since they had seen each other , his falling out with Thomas Kyd , Robert Greene 's death and the final confession he had made . " And this other man , Chettle  --  he never apologized ? " Will asked . " Nay . All of London waits to see if I 'll repent . You have no idea how trying it can be . " " And will you ? " " Nay , " he said . The light began to fade from the windows . Will 's room , invariably cold , grew chilly , and he moved closer to the other man . Will drifted off to sleep ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought about the Star Chamber meeting tomorrow , worrying over what he might say . A nuisance , but then if it had n't been for the summons to London he would not have seen Will . He must have slept , because two thoughts came together in his dreams and woke him , his heart pounding . At least one of the Catholic conspirators had never been found , the man whose voice had sounded familiar . And Will had gone to the Catholics in Rheims . He lay still and listened to Will 's soft , even breathing . He had not known how much he cared for the man . Nay , he was done with mysteries . He had all the answers he needed . * * *  | The faces of the judges of the Star Chamber looked grave , impassive , and Christopher took that as a good sign ; they had n't made up their minds to condemn him just yet . Some of them he recognized : Archbishop Whitgift , dressed all in black , and his secretary , Abraham Hartwell ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burghley was a portly man who seemed a little pompous ; Robert Cecil , the hunchback , was thinner and fragile-looking , with fine cheekbones and a languid courtier 's expression . To his left sat the Earl of Derby , and Christopher felt pleased to see him ; his son , Lord Strange , patronized the acting company that had performed several of his plays . He did n't recognize the three other men , but they made no move to introduce themselves . Henry Maunder , the man who had come to arrest him , had said only that blasphemous papers had been found in Thomas Kyd 's room , and that Kyd had told the Star Chamber the papers were Christopher 's . He could not remember leaving any manuscripts with Kyd but he supposed that that did n't mean he had n't . He wondered what the Chamber had found , what they had thought important enough to bring him to London in a plague season . " Do you recognize this manuscript ? " Archbishop Whitgift asked . He took the papers Hartwell held out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretical conceits denying the deity of Jesus Christ our Savior found among the papers of Thos Kyd , prisoner , " and another hand had added : " Which he affirmeth he had from Marlowe . " He looked from that to the manuscript itself , and when he did so he nearly laughed in relief . If poor Tom Kyd had known anything at all about theology and been able to argue a little he would not have needed to drag anyone else into this business ; the thing was nearly as safe as the Geneva Bible . He had been fortunate , very fortunate , that this was all they had found . " Aye , " he said . Robert Cecil made a note on a piece of paper in front of him , " Is it yours ? " Whitgift asked . " Aye . " p 233 " How do you come to have such a blasphemous manu-script ? " Christopher looked directly at the archbishop . " It is n't blasphemous . It 's ? " " Not blasphemous ! Why , man , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Lord . " " Aye . That 's the Arian heresy , which claims that Christ was not divine . But the manuscript itself is called The Fall of the Late Arian , and it refutes those claims . " " I did n't see any refutation . " Nay , Christopher thought , you did n't see it because it is n't there . I had n't paid the scrivener to copy that part out . " Aye , " he said . " I know a little about theology ; I studied it at Cambridge for six years . I had thought , perhaps presumptuously , that I would try to answer the claims myself . " " And how would you answer them ? " This part was easy ; he could do this in his sleep . He marshalled arguments , quoted Scripture , referred to church authorities . At least one of the men he cited , judging by the archbishop 's expression , was unknown to Whitgift . He finished with a statement of conventional piety that brought satisfied nods from nearly half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entire page with notes . But Whitgift still looked unconvinced . " And you yourself , " the archbishop said . " Do you agree with the claims put forward here ? " " Nay , of course not , " Christopher said firmly . But if you ask me what I do believe , he thought , I will have to lie to you . No one had any further questions . Christopher spoke into the silence . " My lords , some of you in this room may know that I was once an agent for Sir Francis Walsingham . I went to Rheims several times to gather information on the Catholics there . And a few years ago I helped Sir Philip Potter discover the names of those who had plotted against the queen . " A few men looked up at that , interested . Robert Cecil hurriedly made another note . " Aye , " Lord Burghley said . " I remember . That was a job well done . " " Still , I ca n't understand why you copied only half this manu- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It seems somehow sinister , would n't you say ? " He turned to the others in the chamber for confirmation . " But if he was a student of divinity , after all ... " one of the men said . Silence settled over the chamber again . Finally Burghley spoke . " We 'll have to discuss this matter among ourselves , " he said . " Please wait for us outside . " Christopher went out into the antechamber . The room had become hot and he was sweating lightly , worried , finally , about what the judges would decide . His throat felt dry . He should n't have talked for so long ; folks did n't like it when you were too clever . He had antagonized Whitgift , that much was clear . The archbishop would probably prefer that no one meddle in divinity , that everyone accept the answers that came down from the clergy . And the idea of copying out a manuscript simply because you were curious about the ideas in it , because it stated something different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known  --  well , Whitgift would not like that at all . But how much weight did the archbishop 's opinion carry ? Some of the others seemed to oppose him . Burghley , for example , clearly remembered Walsingham with affection ; Christopher had done well to mention the man 's name . But he had n't remembered to remind Derby of his connection with Lord Strange . Well , it could n't be helped ; if they gave him another chance he would say something . Damn , what was taking them so long ? He walked up and down the narrow room anxiously . If they decided he was a heretic what would they do to him ? Prison , torture , death at the stake ? They had cut off a man 's hand for writing blasphemy . Nay , best not to think about it . He would triumph over these judges as he had won out over others in authority . And perhaps when this was over he would be more careful in his speech . But why should n't he be able to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . Hartwell , Whitgift 's secretary , called him back into the chamber . Whitgift began to speak , and for a moment Christopher  | thought that he was lost , that they had all come to agree with the man . What would Will think if he did n't come back ? " We have been unable to reach a decision , " Whitgift said . " We command therefore that you remain in attendance on us , and that you report to us daily to show that you have not left London . " Christopher nodded , not trusting himself to speak . He had not been set free , then , but at least he would not be going to prison . He found he had been holding his breath and he let it out slowly . " You may go , " Hartwell said , and he left the chamber . In the afternoon he and Will walked around London , trying to find his old companions . The sun shone weakly overhead ; he was surprised , after the warmth of the Star Chamber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked to the few booksellers who had remained during the plague . No one knew where Nashe had gone to , but Ned Blount had heard that Kyd had been sent to prison . At that Christopher felt his heart stop for a moment and then start again , loudly and too fast . What had happened to Kyd ? Did they torture him ? He had not known the dangers he faced when he had argued theology so heedlessly with the men of the Star Chamber . " Do you do much spy-work ? " Will asked at the end of the day , as they walked back to the manor . " Nay , none at all . " " Why not ? " " I have a patron now , for one thing . I do n't need the money . " " But the excitement , the ? Did n't you enjoy it ? " Christopher laughed . " It proved a little too exciting for me , finally . But I 've been out of the game so long I would n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't seen Rob  --  my superior in years . " " But surely they 'd take you back . You discovered the Catholic conspirators ? " " Were n't you the one siding with the Catholics ? " " I told you  --  I found them interesting , no more . I would n't want to be ruled by them . "  | Christopher laughed again . " Nor I. But sometimes I think the Protestants are as bad , or worse . " Too late he remembered his promise to be more circumspect in his speech , and he looked around him carefully . But the street was deserted , as every public place in London seemed to be . When they returned to Will 's manor they found a letter waiting from his father . Will read it several times , anxiously . " He wants to meet with me , " he said at last , looking up . " Look here  --  he 's set a date . Finally . " " Good . " " Aye . But I 'm worried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wants to disown me ? " " What if he does ? " " What 'll I do ? " " You 'll do what the rest of us do . Why should it matter what your father thinks ? " " It matters , " Will said . He looked troubled . Christopher thought of his own father , who still , after six years , could not grasp what it was his son did in London . " Why should he disown you ? He 'll be pleased that you 're back from Rheims , that 's all . " " Aye . You 're probably right . " For the first time in his life Christopher thought he could see what the future held for him . Will would inherit a good portion of his father 's estate , and he and Will would live together . " Come live with me and be my love , " he had written a long time ago , when he had been too young to know what love was . The days they spent together seemed almost to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have had no worries whatsoever . Sometimes he made an appearance before the Star Chamber but he soon stopped going daily and the judges came not to expect him : doubtless they wanted to do their job and return to the country as soon as they could . In the afternoons he and Will walked through the streets , marveling at the absence of crowds . The usual London sounds had disappeared ; they heard only bells rung for funerals and the howling of hungry dogs . They climbed to the top of the tower at Paul 's and  | looked out over the river , sparkling in the weak May sun . They went to plays and discovered a few crowded taverns filled with men who did n't care what happened to them . Several times they saw the huge bonfires lit at night to drive away the corruption of the air . Once , as they walked back to Will 's manor , they heard a Puritan at Eleanor Cross on Cheapside , calling for their repent-ance . " There is wrath gone out from the Lord : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A group of people surrounded him , defying the order against crowds . There was no way around the assembly . He and Will tried to push through but the preacher stopped them . " Hold ! " he said . " Are you the sort of men who profane the Lord 's Day ? " Christopher had n't even known that it was Sunday . " Evi-dently , " he said . They made it to the edge of the crowd , but something caused him to turn back . A man stood there watching him , someone with pale , watery-blue eyes . A man he had n't seen in over three years . Robert Poley.  | The cold May wind blew through the churchyard , riffling the pages of books and scattering ballads . Alice weighed down her books and pamphlets with rocks and then looked out over the yard . A lone gallant walked back and forth in front of the tomb of Duke Humphrey , clearly hoping that someone would stop him and offer him a meal . He must be unfortunate indeed , Alice thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had n't much pity to spare for him , though . She had sold two books the day before and one so far today . Most of the acting companies had gone to the countryside and would n't need the playbills she published every year . If the plague continued , she thought , she would run through her meager savings and have to sell everything she owned to another stationer . But not to George  --  nay , not to George , though he seemed to prosper while others failed . One of his young apprentices worked at his stall today , and rumor had it that George had gone to buy a printing press , that he was setting himself up to be a printer as well as publisher and bookseller . According to Edward , George had a ready supply of gold coins , and he was not miserly about treating men to a drink . The stationers whispered stories of counterfeiting among themselves but only Alice p 239 knew the truth : that George dabbled in black magic . She could almost laugh at the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very crime he had accused her of , but because she had never been acquitted of the crime no one would believe her . Could she sell to Walter ? But Walter had started in the bookselling trade late and fared even worse than she did . And what would it be like to engage in a trade agreement with him ? Nay , she could n't face it . She would have to sell to Edward , then . Edward would be a good choice . She sighed to think of her books displayed on another stall . Would Edward take as good care of them ? Nashe 's Strange News had come out in February and had sold well for a time , until folks had started to escape to the country . She paged through it now , marveling that the man 's invention never seemed to fail , that he had been able to fill page after page with invective against Gabriel Harvey . Would Edward know what to do with a book like this ? She looked through the book , laughing a little as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy upon thee , for thou art fallen into his hands that will plague thee . . . His verses run hobbling like a brewer 's cart upon the stones ... This mud-born bubble , this bile upon the brow of the University , this bladder of pride new blown .. . She laughed again . Nashe had put her in a good humor , something he always seemed able to do . Her business would not fail : she had come this far on her wits , the only woman ever to do so , and she would survive everything , even the plague . With this new hope it seemed to her that spring , delayed for so long this year , would arrive soon ; that it had traveled far , over perilous routes , but that within the next few days all the churchyard would wake to the intoxicating smell of fertile earth and new green leaves . Everything was on the verge of beginning , she felt ; and as she thought this she saw , out of the edge of her left eye , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the churchyard , its wings beating rapidly for balance . As she watched it was joined by another , and then more , perhaps a dozen all together . No one else 240 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | seemed to see them . They circled and skittered off toward the gate , then returned . She watched them as they flew . They spun dizzily and arced to the gate again . Without thinking about it she closed her stall and followed them . Margery stood outside the churchyard gate . Agnes was with her , and Arthur . Her breath caught to see him again . " It 's started , " Margery said . " What has ? " Alice asked . She had not seen Margery for months , not since they had taken Arthur . Her friend and Agnes seemed no different , but Alice marveled at the changes in Arthur . He looked healthy , his skin clear and his hair bright . The faerie-light shone from his face . " Come with me , " Margery said . " We ca n't talk about this here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to Cheapside . No one walked the streets but still she spoke quietly , as if she could be overheard . " We meet with Oriana today . " Oriana ! Alice felt her heart beat loudly . Did that mean she would finally see her son ? But she hesitated , reluctant to go with the other woman . Margery had done something so terrifying that night a half a year ago that even now Alice did not like to think about it . Am I damned if I go with her ? she wondered . Is it a choice between my son and my soul ? She shook her head . I 've done nothing wrong , she thought . And there 's no other way to get my son back . What I want , the winged creatures flew past her and stopped abruptly near Arthur , their wings trembling . Slowly first one and then another circled over his head . They 're crowning him , she thought , feeling almost as if she wanted to laugh . Dull-witted Arthur , the child who had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She studied him as they made the familiar walk to Finsbury Field . He had grown fatter in Margery 's house , and he seem more sure of himself , striding on ahead toward the field . S noticed that he never looked in her direction . What had Margery told him about her ?  | Evening fell by the time they reached the field . Of course , Alice thought . Creatures of night . But now she could see Oriana and her train , shining silver against the dark field . It was too late to change her mind . The queen 's people stood around her in a semicircle . The homed men looked at the three women with cold challenge in their eyes and moved their lances forward . Then they noticed Arthur and sank as one to their knees . " Welcome , my king , " one said . Arthur looked foolishly pleased . Oriana held out her hand . " You must tell them to rise , my son , " she said . Arthur took her hand . " Rise , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his voice . " I am pleased to see you back , " Oriana said , as the men around her came to their feet . " The war has gone badly for us . " " Aye , " Arthur said . It all seemed too much for him . Alice wondered if Oriana would blame her for his slowness . Margery otioned to him and he added quickly , " My queen . " Oriana seemed pleased at that . " But now I have no doubt at we will conquer . Now that you are here with us . " Arthur grinned . " I thank you for your help in this matter , " riana said to Margery . She motioned to her guard and turned go . " What about my son ? " Alice said , coming forward . Margery aved at her to stay back but Alice ignored her . Had it all been trick , then , to get Arthur from her ? What did they care if she t her son or not ? Oriana had never even embraced Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aye , of course , " she said easily , if Alice 's son were a parcel she had misplaced . " Come , my Y A boy stepped between two of the homed men . Surely this child could not be over twenty ! Alice thought . He smiled at her , expression of someone who hopes to please . She held her nd out to him and tried to smile back , but all the while she could not help but feel that a mistake had been made . He did not resemble either her or John . He was slight , with g dark-brown hair . A light seemed to shine in his brown 242 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | eyes , like a candle behind a closed curtain . Now she saw that he must be older than she had first thought , but that a kind of innocence had made him look almost boyish . There must be so much that he did n't know , she thought , so much they had n't told him . What had it been like to grow up among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She embraced him , not out of any motherly feeling but out of a certain spite toward Oriana . He responded slowly , as if he had never seen such a thing before . Margery turned to go . As they left Alice saw Oriana and Arthur deep in conversation , Arthur laughing and nodding eagerly . She felt as if a blade had pierced her heart . Nay , she thought , almost going back to say it . This is n't my child . Arthur 's my son , my true son ! Then she felt Margery 's hand on her shoulder , and she allowed the other woman to lead her back to the city . There was , first of all , the problem of what to call him . By asking the child questions she found that the Fair Folk had never given him a name , calling him " Boy " whenever they needed him , which had n't been often . For the most part they seemed to have treated him as unwanted baggage , carrying him with them from place to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old stories , had insisted on Arthur as the name for their baby , and at that thought she realized that John had never seen his true son . Her heart hardened further against Oriana . Very well , she thought . I 'll call him Arthur , as John would have wanted . It was our name before it was hers , after all . But Arthur had too much of majesty about it , brought back too many memories of the Prince of Faerie , and she soon shortened it to Art . The nickname was a liberty the old Arthur would never have allowed , but this child was almost pathetically eager to please . He was not disappointed that Alice could not light a room by simply walking into it , the way Oriana apparently had ; instead he seemed to think that setting a candle alight was magic as good as anything the queen could do . When they talked it soon became clear that neither of them understood the other : he did not know what a coach was , or a book , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , could not follow his tales of the queen 's court , which seemed filled with intrigue and complicated in the ex-treme . She realized from his stories that he must have been a very observant child . John would have loved this boy , she thought . For her part she could only try to prepare him for the society of men and women , and she felt herself growing wearier and wearier under the magnitude of her task . She was not a young woman , to raise someone as childlike as this boy seemed to be . Brownie helped , of course . She had thought that Brownie would return to Oriana now that they had found Arthur , but he had stayed on , and for that she was grateful . Her son had known Brownie from his time among the Fair Folk , and now Brownie kept him company when she went to work , showing him how to do simple household chores and telling him stories . She thought that perhaps the boy might have gotten a better introduction to human society than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only when she saw the two of them together that she noticed the faerie-light shining from her son 's face , and it increased her feeling that a mistake must have been made . But why not ? she thought . Surely Art had lived long enough among the Fair Folk to become a little like them . The thought made her even more determined to teach him his place in the real world . She told the stationers that Art was the son of her sister , now dead of the plague . She was sorry for the lie , but she knew how quickly families changed in times of infection , and that it would not surprise anyone in a month or so if she started to call him her son . A few of the booksellers worried that he had brought the plague with him , but when they both remained healthy the objections ceased . Probably folks thought she had kept the illness away by black magic .  | Christopher turned away , pretending that he had n't seen the other man . It seemed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the timeless holiday of the past week . But Robert came toward them , calling his name . " Do you know him ? " Will asked . " Aye . Let 's go before he catches up to us . " " Christopher ! " Robert said , shouting . He had been one of the few of Christopher 's acquaintances never to call him Kit . " Wait ! " Christopher waited . He might as well stop and talk . What did he care what Poley said ? He was done with spying . " Good day , " Robert said , looking at Will . Christopher knew that look ; he was trying to remember if he should know Will , if the other man was someone of consequence . " How have you been ? " " Well , " Christopher said . As always around Robert he felt impatient , annoyed with the man 's subtleties . " And you ? " " Oh , doing well , doing well . " Robert looked off into the distance , abstracted . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that so ? Three years . " Christopher nodded . For a few months after his work in the  | queen 's court he had wondered why Robert had n't contacted him again . Perhaps , he 'd thought , Robert had lost his place during the shift of power following Walsingham 's death , or had been envious that it was Christopher who had discovered the conspirators . Finally , though , he had decided that it did n't matter . He had his patron , and would never need to work for Robert again . The other man seemed surprised to see him still in London , looking fit and prosperous . No one had told him about the patron , then . " What are you doing now ? " Robert asked . " Working for someone else , " Christopher said . Immediately he felt childish ; he had responded to an old desire to wound Robert , had reduced himself to the other man 's level . Still he could n't help but feel gratified at the expression on Robert 's face , a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field was wide open ; he could have been working for anyone . " Are you ? " Robert looked at Will again , as if to say , Should we discuss these delicate matters in front of him ? Christopher nodded . Now it was his turn to keep silent , to hoard information . He felt sure that it tormented Robert not to know who his employer was , who Will was . Robert looked at the ravens wheeling in the sky above London . " We should have a talk , you and I. Catch up on what we 've missed . A great deal has changed since that dotard Walsingham died . " Why not ? Christopher thought . Now that he was free of Robert he could listen to the other man rationally , without anger . And he might learn something ; Robert 's sources of information , he knew , were very good . " When ? " Will moved slightly . " Nay , do n't go , " he said softly . " Tell him you 're busy . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To his surprise Christopher began to feel hedged in , impatient . What made Will think he had such a claim on him ? " I 'm not that busy , " he said to Will . " You 're meeting with your father the day after tomorrow . I could go then . " 246 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | Will looked defeated . Christopher turned back to Robert . " The usual place ? " he asked . " Usual ? ? Nay , you have been away a long time . There 's a new place now , in Deptford . A widow 's house , very private . No one listening over your shoulder . I 'll tell you how to get there . " Two days later Christopher and Will walked to the river , where Will would get a boat to take him to his father 's estate . The sun had not yet risen ; his father , Will explained , liked to begin the day early . Heavy fog lay on the river . " Listen , Kit , " Will said . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course I am , " Christopher said impatiently . " Why should n't I be ? " " I do n't know . I  --  I do n't trust him . He looks  --  I do n't know  --  untrustworthy . Devious . " " Aye , he is untrustworthy . But I know that in advance , and that 's what makes me safe from him . Do n't worry about me . " " Well , but be careful . Promise me you 'll be careful . " Christopher was saved from answering by the cry of the waterman . " Westward ho ! " the man called from his boat , his voice muffled . The boat came toward them out of the gloom . It looked black , like a mourning barge . They said their farewells , and Christopher watched as Will stepped inside . Will seemed to grow insubstantial , blending with the pearl and gray and black of the river . The waterman pushed off . Fog curled over them . He watched until they were lost to sight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deptford . Christopher had never seen Robert Poley so affable , so expansive . They sat at a table in the widow 's house in Deptford , and Robert regaled him with story after story , tale after tale . His accounts were like those Christopher had sometimes heard in the Black Boar , tales of journeys taken , information exchanged , men betrayed . But he felt certain that Robert 's stories , unlike the others he had heard , were true . The widow came in and set their dinner on the table . Robert p 247 stopped halfway through an account of how he had exposed a spy selling information to the Spanish ambassador and began to eat , motioning to Christopher to join him . " Well met , " Robert said with satisfaction , adding sugar to his wine and taking a sip . " Well met indeed . It 's been far too long . " " Aye , " Christopher said . He had prepared himself for everything but this strange new mood of Robert 's , and he could not help but wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Christopher worked for , probably , but the answer was so ordinary , so lacking in drama , that Christopher hesitated to give it to him . He found himself wanting to match Robert 's stories with his own . " I hear you acquitted yourself well at court , " Robert said . " That was well done , very well done . Though I wish I had heard the story from you . " Christopher looked at him in surprise . He had thought , when weeks went by and he had n't heard from Robert , that the man had n't wanted to see him . And by that time he had found a patron , and there had been no reason to seek the agent out . Did Robert think that they were friends ? He began to tell him about his adventures at the queen 's court : the men he had overheard rehearsing the play , the actor who had been killed instead of the queen during the masque , his chase through the hedge maze after one of the conspirators . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be able overpower him , but in the end I did n't have to . There was another man in the maze . " " Another man ! " Robert said , his pale blue eyes intent . " Who ? " " I do n't know . " Suddenly he thought he understood something , and the realization was so strong that he wondered how he 'd missed it for three years . " He was one of your men , was n't he ? You had more than one agent at the palace , did n't you ? " " More than one agent ? " In the space of a breath the Robert he had known was back , secretive , impassive , closed in on himself like a fortress . " Nay  --  one was enough , certainly . Why would I want more ? " " I do n't know . You did n't trust me , perhaps . " " Of course I trusted you ? " 248 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | " Nay , you did n't . You told me so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " To spy ? " " Aye . " It was a relief to be able to tell Robert what he thought , to no longer have to depend on the man for employment . " You told me my opinions were unorthodox . You said you doubted my worth to you ? " " Do you think I have so many men , then , that I can spare one to do nothing but watch you ? And who would watch this watcher  --  another man , I suppose ? Nay , you 're being foolish . And how can you suppose I would have hired this strangelooking man , barely four feet tall ? Who would have trusted such an outlandish fellow ? " It seemed to Christopher that everything stopped suddenly , that the entire motion of the world came to a halt with Robert 's last sentence . He felt very cold . " I did n't tell you he was four feet tall . " Robert hesitated only a moment . " Of course you did . How would I know it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm certain I did n't . " He spoke slowly , putting his guesses together as he talked . " You knew because he was one of your agents , as I said . All those strange folk at the palace , the ones who told me they were petitioning for their ancestral rights , all of them were yours . And that voice I overheard , the one that sounded so familiar  --  that was your voice , I 'm certain of it . " " What are you talking about ? What voice ? " " The one plotting to kill the queen . " " Plotting ? Nay , you have lost your wits . And why in God 's name would I hire you to discover this conspiracy if I was a part of it ? " " Do n't change the subject . Who were they ? Were they searching for Arthur too ? " Robert 's eyes widened ; his guess had been correct . lie pressed on . " Good . There were two conspiracies at the palace , then  --  the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of them wanted to overthrow the queen and set Arthur in her place ; both were looking for Arthur to use him in p 249 some way . You were part of this second group , hurrying to find him before the first one did . But you used the first group , too , did n't you ? ? in case they got to him before you did . You encouraged them to think that the populace would rise up in revolt against the queen despite all evidence to the contrary . And if they got too close you knew you could always expose them . But nay  --  you could n't expose them yourself because they trusted you , they thought you were one of them . If the queen did n't believe you you 'd have to start all over again . So you hired me to do it . But Arthur got away from you , did n't he ? " " Aye , " Robert said . He was breathing heavily . " Where did he go ? " " What ? " Whatever Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is he ? " " I do n't know . " " I 'm certain you do . You know too much about this business to be as innocent as you pretend . Cecil swears you 're not working for him , and Essex has no idea what he 's doing most of the time . So you have to be working for these people . But which side ? Oriana or the red king ? " " The  --  red king ? Who is he ? " " Oriana then . How close are you ? Do you know where he is ? " " Which one do you work for ? " " The red king , of course . He pays me very well , far better than Oriana would . " " Wait . Wait a moment . You work for this  --  this red king ? Was it in the service of this man that you encouraged the plotters to kill the queen ? They nearly did kill her , you know . It was only luck that saved her . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do n't care what happens to the queen . You 've as good as told me you work for the Fair Folk . " The Fair Folk . First Tom and now Robert : this lunacy seemed to be a disease sweeping London like the plague . But Robert , unlike Tom , was a practical man , far too canny to believe in goblins . What was the agent hiding ? Who were these people he 250 LISA GOLDSTEIN  | had mentioned , Oriana and the red king ? How far was he sunk in treason against his queen ? He was not done with spying after all . He would have to discover more . How much did Robert think he knew ? What would he be willing to barter for information ? Christopher ran his hand through his hair . " The murdered man , the one who was killed the night we left the Black Boar , " he said cautiously . " Who was he ? Which side did he work for ? " " He worked for the Catholics , actually . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher tried not to let the other man see his exaltation . The gamble had worked ; for the first time since he 'd known him Robert had parted with information . " He 'd discovered the other plot , the folk working for the red king , " Robert went on . " He made the mistake of telling me about it . I had to have him killed . " " That 's why you were so anxious to leave that night . You did n't want me to see that you knew him , and knew his assassin as well . " " Of course . " Robert looked at him condescendingly , as though he were a slow pupil who had finally come to understand that day 's lesson . " But then I changed my mind  --  I decided I needed you at the court after all . So I forged the note I showed you ? " " You forged ? Did you forge the blood as well ? " Robert showed his rotting teeth . It took Christopher a moment to realize that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real enough , " he said . " I did n't know if you would believe me  --  I had to pretend to be angry at you that day to keep you from suspecting anything . But you did believe it , did n't you ? Enough to go to court and do the work I needed you to do . Though you needed the red king 's men to help you every so often . " " Aye , " Christopher said . He sat back , astonished . He had never left the maze he had entered at court , he realized ; he had been wandering through its twists and turns for three years . And the end of it all was the same as the beginning , this smiling man here before him . Robert had had a hand in everything . He p 251 said slowly , " Do you know  --  did you know a man named Geoffrey Ryder ? " " Aye , " Robert said pleasantly . " Since we 're being so open with each other I may as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did indeed have more than one agent at court . Geoffrey was the other one . How did you know ? " " You quoted Chaucer to him once . You heard one of the plotters speak a line from Canterbury Tales and you repeated it to him , probably without even realizing it . And he repeated it to me . That 's why , I guess , he and Will asked me if I was a spy the first time we met  --  Geoffrey had heard about me from you and he said something to his brother . Or ? " The next question proved much harder to ask . " Or was Will working for you too ? " " Will ? He was Essex 's man , was n't he ? Not very suited for this kind of work , I always thought . " Christopher let out his breath in relief . He did not think he could stand more of Robert 's double-dealing . " Now it 's your turn to answer questions , " Robert said . " I never give away knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would Robert say if he told him the truth , that the man who employed him , Thomas Walsingham , wanted not information but a poem ? Oh , he would have to be careful , very careful . " I have n't done much at all since I left your service , " Christopher said slowly . " I know some of the old men , followers of Sir Francis , but I 've been out of the game for a while . " Robert watched him shrewdly . " To tell you the truth , I miss it , " Christopher said . " Does this  --  this red king have anything to offer me ? Who is he ? " " I told you , " Robert said . " He 's king of the Fair Folk . Nay , why are you smiling ? " " The Fair Folk . It 's  --  well , it 's hard to believe , that 's all . " " I assure you it 's true . Probably he would have a place for you , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . How do I know you 're not working for Oriana ? " " I suppose my word will have to be good enough . I can only tell you I 've never heard of her in my life . " 252 LISA GOLDSTEIN STRANGE DEVICES OF THE SUN AND MOON 253  | " Ah . And so we 're back where we started . " Robert called out a word Christopher did n't catch . Something sharp pressed against his neck . One of the little men moved into his sight , still holding the sword to his throat . The man grinned widely . How had he gotten into the room without Christopher hearing him ? " Your clothes are too fine , " Robert said . Christopher turned back to him . " Who 's paying you ? I do n't believe you 're as much out of the game as you pretend . " " I  --  I have a patron now . Thomas Walsingham . A cousin of Sir Francis . " " I know who he is . Why did n't you mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if this man pays you so well ? " Christopher thought quickly . What could he say ? That he had n't said anything because he suspected Robert of treason ? " You work for Oriana , do n't you ? " Robert said . " Is that what Walsingham hired you to do ? " " Nay ! " The sword cut deeper into Christopher 's skin and he tried to back away . " Listen . Listen , Robert . You 've been deceived . There are no Fair Folk  --  this is all folly . This man who calls himself the red king convinced you of his powers but it 's a lie  --  it 's all lies . He 's tricked you . " " Is that what you think ? " " Of course . What proof do you have of anything supernatural ? These folks have led you astray , have caused you to betray your queen . " " Proof ? " Robert said . " Oh , I have proof enough . " The little man flared , became a spire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christopher 's doublet . Then , just as quickly , he returned to what he had been , a small unearthly man grinning widely from ear to ear . " There will be a battle soon , " Robert said . " A great battle . He would fight in that form , but his enemies can turn to water just as easily . Do you understand ? There 's your proof , if you need it . Christopher barely heard him . What had happened ? Was it true then , all of it ? Did Tom really journey through that strange land he talked about ? Was Arthur really a king ? Robert had  | challenged everything he believed in , called into question all he knew . He could not ignore what he had seen , but it was something so far removed from his experience that he could hardly bring himself to take it in . " Do you believe now ? " Robert asked . " Nay , I saw nothing . Why should I believe you ? " " Nothing ! Why , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you say " Did he ? I did n't see it . " " What is this folly ? Do you only believe things you see with your own eyes ? " " Aye , " Christopher said , his voice level . " Is this something you learned at Cambridge ? " Robert said angrily . For a moment no one spoke . The man blazed outward again , becoming fire . This time Christopher was ready . He stood quickly and drew his dagger , then knocked over the table and placed the dagger at the agent 's throat . The flame darkened , solidified , became a man again . " Call him off , " Christopher said harshly . The little man looked from one to the other of them , uncertainty in his eyes . " Do it or I 'll kill you . " " I  --  I will , " Robert said . " You heard him . Put away your sword . " The little man returned his sword to a sheath almost as big as he was . " Good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think , but the wonders Robert had shown him kept crowding into his vision . Things he had denied had proved to be real . What else had he been wrong about ? The world had shown itself to be a far stranger place than he had thought . Robert called out a word he did n't understand . The window opened , and little men slid through like a fall of leaves , grinning and calling to each other . Several held swords out in front of them . Christopher turned , but he was not quick enough . One of the men knocked the dagger from his hand . " Nay ? " Christopher said , backing away . Robert motioned to the man . Christopher headed for the  | door but another man stopped him : Christ , they were fast ! He spun to face Robert . " I ca n't let you leave , " Robert said . He sounded almost regretful . " I do n't know what your business is here , or who you work for . " " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first man again . Christopher turned toward him quickly , looked wildly between him and Robert . His mouth felt dry . The little man leapt to a bench . His sword came up and pointed toward Christopher 's right eye . He looked for his dagger but it was too late . The man thrust the sword forward . Thomas Kyd knocked loudly on Thomas Nashe 's door , knocked again when no one came to answer . Finally the door opened and Nashe looked out at him . Though it was midday he seemed to have just gotten out of bed . " What half-wit plucks me from my naked bed ? " Nashe said , misquoting Kyd 's play The Spanish Tragedy . Kyd scowled at him . He had come prepared to offer sympathy , but now he realized , angrily , that Nashe had no feelings of compassion at all , that there was nothing he would not turn into some sort of joke . " Your friend 's dead , " he said . " Friend ? Who ? " " Kit Marlowe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said . " Wa it the plague ? " " Nay . He was stabbed . " " Stabbed ? " " Aye . He went to dinner with some friends of his , and ther was an argument over who would pay the bill . Kit took dagger away from one of the men and made as if to stab him and the man turned his hand and drove the dagger into his right eye . " Where did you hear this ? " " It 's all over town . Where have you been ? " " With a patron . " Nashe paused , as if trying to collect hi thoughts . " You 're out of prison , I see . " p 255 " Aye . They let me out a few days ago . They had to  --  I 've done nothing wrong . " Kyd had expected the other man to joke about his time in Bridewell but Nashe said nothing . He looked distracted , at a loss for words . Perhaps the news had affected him more than Kyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kyd made his farewells and turned to go . Nashe spent a restless night . He had not slept well since the brown woman had given him the flower ; sometimes he thought he might be haunted by her the rest of his life . And now this dreadful news Tom Kyd had brought kept him awake . Could it be true ? He had never known Kit to argue about a bill before ; of all of them his friend seemed to have the most money , though where he got it had always been a mystery . At last Nashe passed into a sort of half-sleep , and he began to dream . It was not like any dream he had ever had . He saw nothing , could only hear a witless , idiotic voice speaking in the darkness , droning on and on . After a time he became aware that he could make out the words . " Left , right , " the voice said . " Day , night . Front , back  --  have , lack . Right , wrong  --  short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was dreaming , and he struggled to come awake . " Short , tall , " the voice said . " Big , small . False , true  --  old , new . " The voice seemed to speak to him for hours , tireless . Finally , near dawn , he awoke . An idea had grown in his mind while he slept , planted by something the voice had said . He dressed quickly and went out to find Tom Kyd . Kyd was not in the room he and Marlowe had once shared . The place had apparently been rented to someone else , a man adding up columns of numbers who demanded to know what he meant by this interruption . Nashe closed the door on him and hurried toward Kyd 's lodgings , his suspicions hardening into certainty as he ran . He took the stairs to Kyd 's room two steps at a time . " Tom !
