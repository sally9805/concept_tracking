<p> The leaders of our colleges and universities , including Dartmouth , bear a high responsibility to their students and to society . By precept and example , they must inculcate in a future generation an understanding of the principles of truth and justice , which are the essential basis of the liberal community . <p> An explosive controversy at Dartmouth raises troubling questions about how its academic leadership is discharging its moral commitments and obligations to the college 's students and to society . <p> Dartmouth 's independent conservative newspaper , The Dartmouth Review , recently was sabotaged . Someone secretly gained access to the production process and inserted a vicious anti-Semitic slur from Hitler 's " Mein Kampf " in the journal 's credo . Since the slur was deviously implanted in a section that remains unchanged from week to week , the subterfuge eluded the proofreaders . <p> When it was discovered on campus , however , a horrified Kevin Pritchett , the editor , repudiated the slur in the strongest terms , apologized in hand-delivered letters to the community and destroyed several thousand copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Review has called for investigations by the local police , the New Hampshire Attorney General and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith . <p> At this point , one might expect Dartmouth 's leadership , understandably concerned over the incident , to launch an immediate fact-finding mission . It is preposterous to believe that The Review espouses the sentiments of Hitler : for a decade , the newspaper has strongly supported Israel and condemned the rise of anti-Semitism on the political left , and the staff has always included several Jewish writers and editors . The Forward , the Jewish weekly in New York , editorialized that The Review is a friend of Jewish causes on a campus increasingly hostile to them . <p> Nevertheless , led by the college president , James O. Freedman , Dartmouth administrators rebuffed efforts by The Review to share its knowledge and solicit cooperation . When editors of the newspaper sought to alert Mr. Freedman to discrepancies in typeface that strongly pointed to sabotage , his office said he was n't interested . <p> He led the campus in a nationally publicized rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - hate directed against student journalists who , as a result , suffered death warnings , threats of violence , as well as mean-spirited accusations . One Review staffer who has lost more than two dozen relatives in the Nazi holocaust returned to his room to find swastikas and epithets on his door . <p> Why would the president of a prominent college act in such reckless disregard of the facts ? Why would he publicly pronounce that " the issue is n't sabotage " and that such protestation " misses the point ? " Why would he cynically exploit a false charge of anti-Semitism against The Review to jeopardize the safety and careers of innocent undergraduates ? Such behavior is hardly consonant with that of a thoughtful and responsible adult , let alone one dedicated to the ideals of truth and fairness . <p> The answer lies in the unique role played by The Review , which is to question , challenge and even deride the dominant liberal orthodoxy on the campus , exposing its hypocrisies . <p> With two editors from India , three female editors , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male 's bastion . It is The Review 's relentless exposure of the excesses of contemporary liberalism , with its emphasis on the preferred treatment of favored groups , that gives the newspaper its peculiar power to shape the Dartmouth agenda , to the embarassment of college officials . <p> When The Review published a critique of a black music professor whose classes were filled with epithets , racial slurs directed against white students and ideological diatribes unrelated to his course material , instead of debating his lectures , Dartmouth sought to shut up the journalists involved by finding them guilty of " vexatious oral exchange " and expelling them . <p> The John M. Olin Foundation helped the students meet legal expenses to argue their claim in court . ( The Review 's operating expenses are met through subscriptions by more than 6,000 alumni . ) A judge vindicated the students , restored them to class and found the Darmouth proceedings biased and unfair . <p> Does Mr. Freedman hope that the false accusation that The Review is anti-Semitic will provide a more convenient way to destroy his student critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Review 's content . I certainly do n't . But the administration should not be allowed to silence Dartmouth 's only independent source of news and of dissent . Mr. Freedman should not be permitted to debase the serious issue of anti-Semitism by using it for political expediency and self-aggrandizement . <p> College officials should be ashamed of abusing the authority and resources of the institution to damage lives , and the Dartmouth administration should be held accountable for its rash willingness to sacrifice the truth and justice of this case to the temptations of political opportunism .
