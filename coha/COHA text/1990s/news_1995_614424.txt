<p> Despite the steady drone of cars on Scott Boulevard/U.S. 78 , the small DeKalb County neighborhood of Sargent Hills appears virtually undisturbed . <p> Beneath its quiet facade , however , changes have been taking place since the late 1940s and early 1950s , when L.D. Sargent developed the subdivision from a section of his landholdings adjacent to his horse farm . <p> Brick and frame bungalows and ranches , priced from $ 10,000 and up , with interest rates between 4 percent and 5 percent , were affordable to many young families . Word spread quickly that the houses were well-built with plaster walls , two and three bedrooms , and one or two baths . <p> One of the biggest attractions always has been the large lots , which are hard to find close in to Atlanta . <p> " I was amazed to find a house with so much property so close in , " said Clyde Morris , an attorney . " I 've got a full acre with tall pines and huge oaks . " <p> In addition , Morris enjoys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's part of the charm of our neighborhood , " he said . <p> Little Creek Horse Farm , as it is called now , is owned by Sargent 's heirs , and is used for boarding horses . <p> " My wife rides horses , and she 's been there to ride , " he said . " We think it 's one of our greatest assets . " <p> Morris ' views of the community 's assets , its location inside the Perimeter , and the quality of homes , were shared by the residents who decided they could further enhance the value of their homes if they were organized . <p> Organizing to enhance value <p> Last fall they started the Sargent Hills Civic Association with a block party and plans to get people involved in the neighborhood and to help deter criminals . <p> Sargent Hills has no major crime problems , according to Tom Watson , administrative officer with the DeKalb County Police Department . He said the neighborhood has had two burglaries and two thefts since the first of the year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> Enthusiasm in the association has been " overwhelming , " according to Jana Collett , a Northside Realty agent . Collett and Morris were elected co-chairmen of the civic club . The annual dues are $ 20 , and membership is optional . <p> " The civic association has given us more of a community feel , " said Morris . " It helps you get to know each other and pools our manpower resources . " <p> Their first project , a neighborhood clean-up , brought out a large crowd . " You would n't believe the people who came out for the clean-up , " said Jeff Petrillo . <p> Traffic improvements made <p> The association already has succeeded in getting the police to set up a radar speed detector on Hollywood Drive , one of the main streets in the neighborhood . The group is working on signs to mark the entrances and expects to have them in place by summer . <p> Petrillo and his wife , Beth Estock , were among the people to see the need for an organized neighborhood association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is changing , " Petrillo said . <p> People are adding rooms and decks and updating their homes . Yards are being improved , and more flowers and shrubbery are being planted . <p> Petrillo lives across from one of the homes that was an eyesore , and when it went into foreclosure , he decided the best way to ensure that it was brought up to code was to buy it . He now is having it renovated . <p> New people moving into the neighborhood are impressed with the association and what it 's doing , according to Petrillo . In fact , every time the neighborhood has one of its projects and outsiders come , another house is usually sold . <p> " The neighborhood is attractive in terms of price and location , " Petrillo said . <p> Lots of people are looking for a place inside the Perimeter that is under $ 100,000 , according to Petrillo . " When we were looking , we could n't find an affordable one in Virginia-Highland or Morningside . But we found it in Sargent Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing . While the median price is $ 85,000 in the community , the three houses that are on the market range from $ 94,900 to $ 99,900 . <p> " The houses generally sell fast , depending on their condition , " Collett said . " But it 's almost like a secret neighborhood in that lots of people do n't know about it . <p> " For many years , this has been a very stable place , " she said . " Now we have more young people and single professionals moving in , but it continues stable . " <p> Remodeling changing neighborhood 's look <p> The once-small bungalows , ranches and Cape Cod styles are becoming more traditional and contemporary as they are remodeled . <p> Sherry and John Venable have given their home a contemporary look with a new stone entrance and a second story . <p> They have been living in the house for 22 years and have done major renovations . <p> " When we moved here , the house had about 1,600 square feet , three bedrooms and one bath , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , which was in the middle of the house , and moved the entrance closer to the end . <p> " We added a living room and dining room area and turned the old living room into a large den with five floor-to-ceiling windows , and bumped out the wall to make it larger . For a master suite , we added a top story with high ceilings and a fireplace , along with a large bathroom and deck . <p> " Everything was eventually gutted in the kitchen . " <p> A beam was added to reinforce the room when it was enlarged , along with oak floors and pickled pine cabinets . <p> " We took part of the old den and breakfast area and made an entrance foyer and provided space for an island in the kitchen , " Sherry Venable said . <p> The Venables added about 1,000 square feet to increase their house size to about 2,600 square feet . <p> " We redid every room except the back two bedrooms , " she said . <p> One of the original bedrooms has been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really needed . <p> Creative Landscaping <p> " We added a deck to the exterior , put in a hot tub with a gazebo- type structure over it , created a fish pond with a waterfall and water lilies , and added a one-car separate garage and a small greenhouse . <p> " My husband did the landscaping , " Venable said . <p> His hobby is flowers and plants , and he keeps a variety of hostas , Japanese maples and flowering shrubbery in the yard . <p> Poppy Thompson , one of the original 13 homeowners , remembers when the roads caused the biggest discussions . <p> For years , people talked about the Stone Mountain freeway going downtown . It came within a mile of her house before it was stopped short of its destination . " People in the downtown area did n't want it , " she said . <p> Thompson watched the commercial growth with interest . She viewed the North DeKalb Shopping Center ( now Market Square ) and Suburban Plaza as a convenience for shopping while she reared her family of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more room . She remodeled her kitchen twice , added a den , and built a two-car garage and a huge deck . <p> " We left the original screened front porch , " she said , noting that this is the only house she has lived in since she was married about 48 years ago . <p> Although the neighborhood has changed some , long-time residents Gerald and Mary Jane Taylor have found that it contains the same good qualities they saw in the beginning . <p> " It 's quiet , has lots of natural woods , friendly neighbors and is within a mile of everything we need - churches , hospital , department stores and supermarkets . The houses have held up well . It 's been a nice place to live , and we have no plans to move . " Chart : History In 1947 , L.D.

The original subdivision plat shows about 120 home sites in the area between Ga . 8 ( now U.S. 78 ) , Valley Brook Road and Hollywood Drive . Sargent decided to keep 46 acres , part of which was in the flood plain of Peachtree Creek , for a horse farm . Some of his heirs still live nearby , although the horse farm is leased out . Most of the first 13 homes were brick bungalows and ranches , but two of the houses had wood siding . Poppy Thompson and her husband , John , were the second homeowners to move in . She remembers their lot was covered with pines and broom sage before the builders scraped it bare . Builders were not planting lawns or doing any landscaping in the area . " They did leave two little water oak trees in the front yard , " Thompson recalls . The Thompsons , both college students and employed full time , bought a two-bedroom , one-bath house . " We paid about $ 10,500 , " Thompson said . Closing cost was $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest difference in the area , and most of the residents have added on to their homes . Thompson 's biggest expense has been updating the plumbing and bathroom , which cost more than the house .
