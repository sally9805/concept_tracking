<p> Hate to disrupt your warm-and-fuzzy , touchy-feely , Siskel-giddy , **45;764;TOOLONG ecstasy . But those of us who look at big pictures realize all is not well with the Bulls , not that it ever will be as long as the killer Jerrys are in charge , planting sticks of dynamite beneath the dynasty . <p> All anyone wants is a happy ending , a famous final scene befitting Michael Jordan and the most celebrated sports circus ever . To establish such nirvana is quite simple , really : Do what Michael wants , which is to reward Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson with proper financial cushions and keep everyone together until the title run expires naturally . Yet , why do we have a gnawing sense that a grisly crash is imminent ? That Pippen very well could be traded by the Feb. 19 deadline ? And that Jordan , in a fatal blow to Chicago 's fragile self-esteem , will end his career in dastardly New York in a package deal with Jackson ? <p> These are questions you should n't have to ponder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rejoice , knowing Pippen is in uniform and in his freshest state in years , knowing the Bulls instantly become faves to win again and finish off the six-pack . Sorry , folks . A complete feel-good experience is n't possible , thanks to the Jerrys . They continue to graze in the background , like those two bitter ogres in the Muppets balcony , doing nothing but fueling the concept of finality and the farcical idea they can start building title teams on their own . <p> Do n't underestimate the pathetic egos of Mr. Reinsdorf and Mr. Krause . Just because Pippen has returned does n't mean they wo n't trade him , as they attempted last summer and many times before . Now that Pippen is back , the sole and collective purpose should be the championship , from the standpoint a franchise has to win as much as possible while the window is open  --  and never , ever should mortgage even one trophy for the future . But Reinsdorf , to recall his recent baseball fire sale , does n't think in such terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leadership and playoff toughness to mature into champions , wo n't offer Eddie Jones ? What is to say the Jerrys , wanting to acquire a star for Pippen instead of getting nothing , wo n't pull the trigger ? What is to say Pippen 's return is nothing but a showcase to inform teams he is healthy , well and available to the highest bidder ? <p> " There 's no guarantee they wo n't trade Scottie before the deadline , " said Jackson , who knows how the Jerrys work . " The assurance Scottie always receives is , ' We 'll never trade you , unless . . . ' So it does n't discount the fact someone could walk in the door and say , ' We 'll give you a first-round draft pick and two players , ' and so then there 's a big gulp and they 'd say , ' What do we do now ? ' " <p> It would be easy enough to end these doubts and fears . All Reinsdorf and Krause have to say is , " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could immerse itself in Bullphoria . But they wo n't say that . Nor will they reverse fields and suggest Jackson could return next year , which Jordan insists is a prerequisite for his return . Stubborn as ever , Krause continues to say that Pippen could be lured away " with an offer that blows us away " and that Jackson wo n't be brought back under any circumstances . The more he says it , the more he should be believed . <p> And the more he says it , the more we must give credence to the absurd but growing possibility that Jordan and Jackson will walk away in a huff and become Kn . . . Kni . . . Knick . . . Knickerbockers . Last month , a certain local columnist said it was OK if Jordan wanted to play in New York , given the b.s. he has to deal with here and his increasing profile as a business mogul . Suddenly , there were Michael and Phil the other night , strategically planting seeds for dozens of witnesses at Madison Square Garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jordan respectfully rejected any chance of playing there . <p> This time , he said he would " love " to play for the Knicks . Not once , but twice . " It would be great to play here in New York , if that situation ( arose ) , " he said . He couched it , as Jordan tends to do , with a sermon about parenting issues and how he might not want to pull his kids out of school . Puh-leaze . Last time Mike talked about being with his family , he spent an entire summer riding buses in the Deep South , in pursuit of the elusive curveball . He would make it work for a season or two , with zealous pushes from the NBA and corporate America . <p> Sure , it would be sacrilege in Chicago . But if the Jerrys are stupid enough not to grant his wishes and maintain the dynasty , then we should understand why Jordan would want to stick it to them and win championships elsewhere . Reinsdorf is the only owner we can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelos , Marge Schott , any of the all-time curmudgeons  --  who would be so crass as to let Michael Jordan get away , especially to the bitter rival . If so , I 'll bring the tar , you bring the feathers . <p> There is little doubt Jackson and Jordan have discussed the prospect . Why do you think they staged that dog-and-pony show , anyway ? They did it to create discussion , excite the fans and catch the attention of Knicks boss Dave Checketts and his father figure in the league office , commissioner David Stern . Jackson said he plans to take a year off , but that was done with respect to the contract of Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy , who is on shaky ground . If Van Gundy is whacked , why would n't Jackson coach the Knicks next season , especially with Jordan alongside him ? <p> What a rotten shame to delve into this swirl , as Pippen resumes his career . If nothing else , what Pippen 's return has done is transfer the bad-guy identity to Reinsdorf and Krause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked like the villain . Now , they would be villains in trading him . <p> Of course , they always have been the villains in the tragicomedy . The reason we supported Pippen 's stance , and were so miffed when he mushed out like putty , was that we considered his principles to be sound . When Uncle Jerry had a chance to give him a balloon payment years ago , back when the labor agreement allowed whopper payoffs , he refused . Now that Pippen has become a Hall of Famer and wearer of five rings , he should be compensated for Reinsdorf 's cheapskate tactic , especially with the dramatic changes in the NBA salary structure . He wo n't be . <p> Religiously , blindly , you will cheer your lungs out tonight with Pippen in the lineup and a saner Seattle team in town . You will because you sense the same beautiful routine is ahead , the month-to-month surge of momentum that ends in Grant Park . Our advice : Cheer in moderation . <p> The end could be nearer than you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. to noon Saturdays and Sundays on 950-AM.
