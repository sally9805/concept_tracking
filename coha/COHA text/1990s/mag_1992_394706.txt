As a mark of fall in the north , maple leaves colored vivid yellows and oranges begin to carpet the ground . The air is sharp and clear , filled with the aromas of the changing biosphere . Winter is just around the corner along with skiing , warm clothes , and heating bills . Although farther south the changes are less dramatic , everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere plants , animals , and people adjust to the Sun 's appearing lower in the sky and the accompanying shorter days . After we endure  --  or enjoy  --  the cold winter weather , the hours of sunlight increase and the days get warmer . Spring and summer come again and the cycle goes on , seemingly endlessly . The seasons occur primarily because Earth 's rotation axis is n't perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the Sun . Instead , the inclination of the rotation axis , or obliquity , is about 23-1/2deg . The axis always points in the same direction in space  --  the north pole points toward the star Polaris  --  as Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polaris directly overhead through-out your entire life if you lived at the north pole . To a Northern Hemisphere observer , the Sun appears highest in the sky at noon on the day of the year when Earth 's north pole tilts toward the Sun . We call this day the summer solstice and it occurs around June 21 each year . ( Earth 's annual motion about the Sun takes 365-1/4 days . The extra one-quarter day introduces small changes into the dates of the solstices and equinoxes . ) Along with its high altitude , the Sun stays above the horizon for a long time each day , depositing on Earth 's surface considerable amounts of energy that warm the land and atmosphere . For the next six months in the Northern Hemisphere , the Sun rises father south each day and reaches its lowest noontime altitude on the day of the winter solstice , around December 22 . At the winter solstice , Earth 's south pole tilts directly toward the Sun . The Sun appears above the horizon for a short period each day . Coupled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of energy deposited on each acre of land decreases during winter resulting in the cold temperatures . Other factors play a minor role in the seasons . The distance between Earth and the Sun is smallest around January 3 each year , when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere . The summer temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere would be hotter than our summer temperatures except for the moderating role of the oceans . Precession changes the direction that Earth 's rotation axis points over a period of 26,000 years . In 13,000 years , winter will occur in that part of Earth 's orbit that previously enjoyed summer . ( Regular adjustments to the calendar keep the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere fixed near March 21 , so summer and winter will still occur during the same calendar months . ) Slow changes in the shape of Earth 's orbit also occur over a period of 93,000 years . And scientists still have n't discovered what causes periodic shifts of our climate into ice ages , the last of which ended around 20,000 years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's season . But what if Earth 's rotation axis tilted at an angle of 90deg instead of 23-1/2deg ? What would seasons be like on this tilted Earth ? A TILTED EARTH Close your eyes and imagine a new Earth whose axis of rotation lies nearly in the plane of its orbit about the Sun , mimicking the rotation of Uranus . The new Earth still rotates once every 24 hours , but let us arbitrarily fix new Earth 's north pole to point toward the star Chi sup 1 Orionis , which is a star in Orion 's upraised right arm about 13deg north of Betelgeuse . Chi sup 1 Orionis lies just below the ecliptic , which is the apparent path of the Sun through the sky as a result of Earth 's orbit about the Sun . Earth 's south pole points toward Beta Virginis ( Zavijava ) . It 's March 21 , the date of the spring equinox on new Earth ( and old Earth ) . The equinox , which means equal night , is one of the two days of the year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location Earth has nearly twelve hours of day and night near the equinox . ( Although equinox means equal day and night , day and night are n't exactly equal on the equinox for two reasons : Earth 's atmosphere bends sunlight so sunrise appears earlier than it would without the atmosphere , and the appearance of the Sun 's upper limb defines the moment of sunrise , so sunrise occurs slightly earlier than if astronomers used the Sun 's center . ) For the next three months , the Sun rises higher in the sky of the Northern Hemisphere . The north pole constantly points toward Chi sup 1 Orionis . But instead of appearing directly at a maximum of 23-1/2deg north latitude as if does for old Earth , the Sun now appears over the north pole of new Earth at the summer solstice , around June 22 . Three months later , at the autumnal equinox , the Sun again rises over the equator and day and night have the same length everywhere on Earth . the Sun appears over the south pole of new Earth at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun 's apparent motion through Earth 's sky completes the seasonal cycle by moving north , appearing over the equator once again around March 21 . ( The cycle of seasons for Southern Hemisphere observers is opposite , with the summer solstice occurring in December and the winter solstice in June . ) Day and night take on new meanings for inhabitants of new Earth . On old Earth , only those lands above the arctic and antarctic circles have days or weeks of continual light in summer and days or weeks of constant darkness in winter . But on new Earth , every place has extended winter periods of constant darkness followed by extended summer periods of constant daylight . ( The equator is a notable exception . It has extended periods of dusky twilight during summer and winter . ) Spring and fall have daily cycles of daylight and darkness , which separate the periods of continual daylight and darkness . For example , imagine you live in Atlanta , Georgia , on new Earth . On March 21 , with the Sun over the equator , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like the citizens of Atlanta on old Earth . Day by day as spring unfolds , the Sun rises higher in the sky . On April 25 as you look outdoors at noontime , you see the Sun on your zenith , or directly overhead , which is something that old Earth Atlantans never see . The United States  --  as every mid-latitude country  --  on new Earth experiences tropical heating from the Sun 's beating straight down . Spring temperatures soar compared with those on old Earth . As the year marches on , the Sun passes north of the zenith at noon . May 19 marks the day for citizens of the new Atlanta when the Sun no longer rises and sets every day . Instead it remains above the horizon all day and continues to do so for the next 68 days . The cycle of daylight and darkness does not return until July 26 . At the summer solstice around June 22 , the Sun appears farthest north . To new Atlantans , it appears 56deg north of the zenith at noontime , or just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southward , passing overhead again in Atlanta on August 18 . As the Sun appears progressively lower in the southern sky at noontime , it finally dips below the horizon on November 17 . This starts a 68-day-long period of darkness and a prolonged and exceptionally cold winter . So in Atlanta on new Earth , the day-night cycle takes place for 7-1/2 months out of the year . For the other 4-1/2 months there is continuous day or continuous night , coupled with harsh summers and winters . All forms of life have to adapt to the extremes of the light-dark , warm-cold cycle that new Earth presents . With variations on the dates and lengths of the period and prolonged daylight and darkness , this sequence of events occurs everywhere on new Earth . The seasonal heating cycle prevents the formation of permanent polar ice caps . The polar regions experience the same tropical heating and high temperatures as the equatorial regions of old Earth . However , the polar regions in winter are exceptionally cold , so seasonal polar ice caps may form . Because the polar caps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorelines on the continents  --  are higher than those on old Earth . If seasonal polar ice caps form , the dominant force controlling weather may shift from jet streams which circle Earth along lines of latitude to a pole-to-pole flow . This mimics the condensation flows seen on Mars , caused by the freezing and thawing of the Red Planet 's polar caps . Thermal flows created by intense heating at one location and cooling at others may replace old Earth 's trade winds and other east-west winds . New Earth residents probably also experience significant seasonal variations in the shoreline , depending on whether the thawing of one polar ice cap occurred at the same rate as freezing at the other pole . This change in sea level would occur on top of a change in the range of tides due to gravitational effects from the Moon and Sun . OCEAN TIDES The Moon causes about two-thirds of our tides and provides the main focus for our discussion . ( The Sun 's gravity provides the rest of the tidal effect . ) Since the force of gravity decreases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's near side more than the center . The stronger pull on the near-side landmass raises it by as much as 20 centimeters compared Earth longitudes 90deg away . A second tide is raised on the side opposite from the Moon , because the Moon 's gravity pulls on Earth 's center more strongly than on the far side . The Moon effectively pulls the center away from the far side raising the far-side landmass by as much as 20 centimeters . Earth 's rigid , rocky material resists the distortion of the Moon 's gravity , so the landmass tides are rather unremarkable . but water flows easily , so the Moon 's gravity raises ocean tides on average by about 1 meter . Bays can accumulate tidal waters of up to 10 meters . We can visualize the gravitational interaction between Earth 's oceans and the Moon as made of three parts : the oceans on the side nearest the Moon , the body of Earth , and the oceans on the side farthest from the Moon . The Moon pulls on the near-side oceans more strongly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , the tidal forces pull these oceans away from the body , creating a high tide . To an Earth observer , high tide occurs when the Moon appears high in the sky . The regions on Earth 90deg away from the area of high tide experience low tide , because water has been drawn from these regions to make high tide elsewhere . The Moon 's gravity in the low tide region pulls along the surface toward the Moon and the region of high tide . Similarly , the Moon pulls earth 's body away from the oceans on the far side , creating high tide . So to the observer on Earth , high tides exist when the Moon is directly overhead and when it is on the other side of Earth . High tides occur roughly 12 hours and 25 minutes apart , so there are almost two cycles of high and low tide each day . The tide cycle is n't exactly twice a day because the Moon orbits around Earth in the same direction as Earth rotates on its axis . It takes the orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , thus crossing overhead in 24 hours 50 minutes instead of exactly 24 hours . ( The two cycles of tides created by the Sun are 12 hours long ) . Tides are significantly different on new Earth compared with the simple rising and falling tides of old Earth . New Earth 's tides are much more complex , even though the Moon remains in the same orbit . The Moon 's orbital plane lies roughly along the ecliptic , so both the Moon and Sun tug primarily on old Earth 's equatorial regions . But new Earth 's rotation axis lies along its orbit  --  that is , it points to a spot along the ecliptic  --  so the Moon does n't orbit around the equatorial regions . but new Earth 's rotation axis lies along its orbit  --  that is , it points to a spot along the ecliptic  --  so the Moon does n't orbit around the equatorial regions . Rather , the Moon has a polar orbit , passing over both of the Earth 's poles as well as twice over the equator during each orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interacting cycles . The Moon pulling on the spinning Earth establishes the almost twice-daily cycle . The relative positions of the Sun ad the Moon determine how high the tides are each day . Spring tides occur when the Sun and Moon line up , since the gravities of the two bodies add together to create larger tidal forces . Neap tides occur when the Sun and Moon are at right angles to one another as seen from Earth . In this case , the gravitational forces counteract each other , creating weaker tidal forces . When both the Sun and the Moon are over new Earth 's equator , spring tides occur . It does n't matter whether the Sun and Moon are on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides , because only the relative forces exerted on the oceans and Earth 's body count . So spring tides have the same height on both sides of Earth whether the Sun and Moon are on the same side of Earth or on opposite sides . As the Moon orbits Earth every 29-1/2 days , the region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest tides ( ignoring shoreline effects ) always occurs at the latitude at which the Moon appears directly overhead . As the Moon passes over the polar regions , observers there on new Earth experience high tide , unlike on old Earth where the polar regions never see very large tidal effects . When the Moon appears overhead to an observer on new Earth 's equator , the tidal cycle consists of nearly two high tides and two low tides every day . Earth 's rotation carries the observer through the different regions of strong tidal forces , creating the high tides and low tides . When the Moon and Sun appear at right angles as seen by an observer on new Earth , the height of the high tide is lowest , resulting in a neap tide . But when the Moon appears overhead to an observer at one of the poles , there is little change in the height of the tide during the day . The tide remains high because Earth does n't rotate underneath the Moon . With the Moon over one of new Earth 's poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the period between " high " tides will change from 12 hours 25 minutes to just 12 hours . The size of the Sun-driven tide is just one-half the size of the lunar tidal variations . There even are days on new Earth when both the Moon and Sun are over Earth 's poles , providing absolutely no change in height of the oceans anywhere on Earth . Observing the Moon from new Earth is different . The Moon still traces its way through the constellations of the zodiac . But where is appears in an observer 's sky is vastly different . The Moon is no longer confined to a path stretching from east to west , as observed from old Earth . Instead , observers can see it virtually anywhere in the sky from north to south . ADAPTING LIFE-FORMS Creating a new world tempts one to populate it and see how the life-forms on its survive and adapt . One of my favorite speculations regards the impact of new Earth 's dramatically changing cycles of light and dark on the development of biological clocks . Biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants make the best use of their waking hours , driving urges to eat , sleep , seek shelter , or store food for the winter . For millions of years , the day has been about 24 hours long on old Earth . ( It 's getting longer as the ocean tides , rubbing against the landmass , slow Earth 's rotation . ) Most living things have biological clocks that run with cycles of between 23 and 25 hours . Earth 's cycle of day and night constantly realigns these cycles to keep them in sync with the changing seasons . In contrast , during experiments in which no day-night change occurs in lighting , people resort to their natural biological clock of around 25 hours to regulate their actions , such a sleep cycles . But life on new Earth , where protracted periods of daylight and darkness exist , would have to adapt differently . Life-forms may depend exclusively upon their biological clocks to avoid the problem of the changing day-night cycle and the periods of prolonged daylight and darkness . Or perhaps the biological clocks would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . When day and night cycles finally returned , the day-night cycle would control activities . ( Would life-forms suffer from suffer from a massive dose of jet lag during the period when the day-night cycle takes over from the internal biological clock ? ) Perhaps life would n't have biological clocks at all . Or perhaps life-forms would have a complex set of rhythms that control activities during the periods of prolonged darkness and prolonged light and that adjust to changes in the day-night cycle . Clearly , whatever dominates the biological rhythms , social and emotional aspects of humans would evolve differently on new Earth . Though we do n't often think about the tilt of Earth 's rotation axis , it impacts the seasons , tides , and many complex biological phenomena . Earth 's moderate temperatures result from its rather uniform heating and the storage of heat by the oceans . We should consider ourselves lucky that Earth does n't have an inclination like that of Uranus , because winters would be long periods of darkness and frigid cold , and summers would be equally long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comins is an associate professor of physics at the University of Maine .
