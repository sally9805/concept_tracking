Today 's culturally diverse entrants to higher education often come academically underprepared , educationally naive , and financially disadvantaged . They tend to be older , work full-time , and have family responsibilities . They stop-in and stop-out ; if they persist to the baccalaureate , they may take 25 years or more to do so ( Cetron , 1994 ; Losak , 1990 ) . And they often begin their postsecondary careers at community colleges . <p> How do we provide quality undergraduate education , especially for this emerging nontraditional constituency ? The study described in this paper was designed to examine the way in which Miami-Dade Community College answered this question and the impact that Miami-Dade 's faculty-focused reform effort had on the institution . Leaders at other community colleges , especially those located in population centers undergoing rapid demographic changes , can benefit from knowing about Miami-Dade 's experience . The Study <p> Miami-Dade 's Teaching/Learning Project was studied over a two-year period by the researcher using qualitative methods . During two site-visits , more than 200 faculty , administrators and staff were interviewed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty were interviewed . Category 1 was composed of faculty whose tenure at Miami-Dade predated the project and who were actively involved in the project 's design and implementation . Category 2 included faculty whose tenure also predated the project ; these people , however , were not involved in the project 's conceptualization and tended to be skeptical of its purpose and value . The third and fourth categories included faculty who were hired either during or after the project 's implementation . The final group was relatively small and consisted of faculty awarded endowed teaching chair positions during the project 's inaugural year ; most of these faculty had no previous involvement in the project . <p> Faculty group interview sessions were arranged by the teaching/learning center directors on each of Miami-Dade 's four largest campuses . Within each interview group , participants cut across disciplines and possessed mixed feelings and beliefs about the project . At each of 20 group sessions , the researcher found people highly in favor of the project , some who were fairly neutral about it , and others who opposed the project  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . In each group and individual interview , the researcher asked the same questions in the same order . As new topics or issues surfaced in the interviews , questions were added to subsequent interviews to address the new concerns . Using a common interview protocol and choosing faculty based on project participation , across disciplines , who exhibited varied sentiments and support levels , allowed the researcher to gather a great deal of data from multiple perspectives ( LeCompte &; Goetz , 1982 ; Erickson , 1986 ) . This , in turn , supplied a rich contextual base for the study ( Lincoln &; Guba , 1985 ) . <p> This base was then augmented with in-depth interviews conducted during and between both site visits with administrators and faculty who played key roles in the project and with staff who were relatively new to the project but quite active in its expansion . These follow-up interviews , in some instances , filled in gaps in the database and , in others , expanded it ( Glaser &; Strauss , 1967 ; Erickson , 1986 ) . All interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity of all interviewees , with the exception of the college president and the project 's director , was unreported in the study . <p> In addition to interviews , the researcher recorded her general impressions and observations of the institution , its members , and the ways in which Miami-Dade conducted its day-to-day business ( Bogan &; Bilken , 1982 ) . Institutional documents and archival data such as self-studies , reports , and a sampling of teaching portfolios were also gathered . All data and materials were sorted , collated , and analyzed several times ( Glaser &; Strauss , 1967 ; Charmaz , 1983 ) . Using Yin 's ( 1989 ) approach to case study analysis , the information was then integrated into a comprehensive case study , which focused on the Teaching/Learning Project . At the same time , the researcher also examined earlier education reforms and the subsequent influence of both sets of reforms on the institution as a whole . Drafts of the study were shared with Miami-Dade representatives as a check for accuracy . Their reactions to the drafts were then used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lincoln &; Guba , 1985 ) . Miami-Dade Community College <p> Miami-Dade functions as a single college with five campuses scattered throughout Dade County , Florida . The student population of roughly 55,000 is 52% Hispanic , 20% African-American non-Hispanic , and 24% white non-Hispanic . Of its total student population , about 75% begin their studies at Miami-Dade with deficiencies in at least one scholastic area ( Miami-Dade , 1993 ) . An estimated two-thirds are first generation college-goers . Many receive some form of financial aid . At the time of the study , 70% of the college 's faculty held full-time status ; between 30 and 35% of faculty , administrators , and academic professionals were minority . <p> The college has a history of education reform . Its first wave of reforms was designed to assess and place students in courses where they could build the skills they needed for success in more traditional college-level work . A core curriculum and a computerized advisement and articulation system were also added . In 1985 , the college was designated the number one community college in America ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution embarked on the Teaching/Learning Project , which ties a comprehensive professional development program to a faculty-designed advancement system in an attempt to affect the classroom effectiveness of its teachers and the learning of its students ( Wolverton , 1994 ) . The Teaching/Learning Project <p> The president at Miami-Dade began the project with a concept paper that outlined his ideas about how the college could build on its first-wave reforms to enhance the teaching and learning environment . He presented it at a retreat attended by more than 100 faculty and administrators ; his only stipulation was that endowed teaching chairs , awarded in-house on a competitive basis , would exist . Everything else was up for discussion and debate . A steering committee and a series of subcommittees began by determining what assumptions and values serve as cornerstones for Miami-Dade . Diversity and quality learning proved to be primary institutional concerns . Using these findings as guides , the committees surveyed faculty , administrators , and students to find out what faculty attributes contribute to student academic achievement at Miami-Dade and arrived at a list of 29 characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the professional development and advancement system components of the project ( Jenrette &; Napoli , 1994 ; Murray , 1994 ; Wolverton , 1994 ) . Professional Development <p> The professional development portion of the project had three main elements  --  graduate-level courses , new faculty orientation and mentoring , and fully staffed teaching/learning resource centers on each campus . <p> The courses . In collaboration with faculty at the University of Miami , two graduate-level courses , one on classroom assessment and the other dealing with teaching and learning strategies ( especially those that are culturally specific ) , were designed to meet the specific needs of Miami-Dade faculty . Both are now offered twice a year at sites on the college 's three largest campuses . New faculty are required to take one of the courses as a condition of employment . Participation by others is voluntary . <p> One course , Assessing Learning in the Community College , is divided into five units . The course begins by examining the philosophical underpinnings and objectives of assessment , compares assessment to evaluation , and discusses summative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at various ways to assess student acquisition and application of learning . They also focus on classroom feedback strategies . Participants learn to match assessment techniques to course objectives , to construct tests , and to interpret the results of summative evaluations . In the final stages of the course , faculty learn how to interpret the data gathered through classroom feedback , both qualitative and quantitative , and engage in hands-on practice  --  considering the purpose of classroom research and its problems and investigating how to structure classroom processes to facilitate classroom research . <p> In the second course , Effective Teaching and Learning in the Community College , faculty receive an overview of learning theories , learn about research that looks at learner characteristics and learning strategies , and examine teacher characteristics and teaching styles . They contemplate the role of motivation in learning , learn how to assess and interpret student motivation , and identify teaching strategies that enhance student motivation . In addition , they build a base of information about themselves , the subjects they teach , and the students with whom they interact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom has been substantial . Surveys have shown that faculty and administrators who successfully complete the classroom feedback course tend to shift their emphasis away from attending exclusively to student achievement and learning skills and toward assessing their own teaching styles ( Cuevas , 1991 ) . For instance , following his completion of the classroom assessment course , one faculty member invited fellow instructors into his classroom on a regular basis to collect feedback from his students , which he then used to improve what took place in his classroom . " This is probably the first semester where I have used tools to actually empower my students to feel more involved in their own education .... I think that 's great . " His revelation about his experience resembles those of many of his colleagues . One offered this example , " Last summer I started paying closer attention to the way I write my tests and prepare students for them . After each test I now ask students two questions : Was the preparation for the test adequate ? And was the test fair and the format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I hated it , ' and leave it at that ; tell me what can be done to improve test preparation , the test format or the test questions .... They 're the students very happy with this arrangement and feel that they 're learning much more . It shows in their progress . " <p> A newly hired faculty member related the significance of the teaching strategies course . " You can take it for granted that one of the questions for new hires will be ' Can you function in multicultural environments ? ' One of the things that the course made us aware of is the fact that students from different cultures learn in different ways . " In addition , the course exposes participants to different teaching styles and the mechanics behind using such tools as audio and visual equipment , student participation , and projects . " We bring back new ideas from the course .... The rest faculty are starting to see that a lot more is going on now than did a few years ago . " <p> Many find that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity it gives them to interact with other faculty . For these faculty the courses help them identify problems that students have in different departments and alert them to how other faculty handle those problems . <p> Orientation and mentoring . All new employees go through some sort of formal institutional orientation . In the case of new faculty , the process extends over a one-year period and includes a three-day preservice orientation and monthly or bimonthly workshops offered through the Teaching/Learning Centers . One instructor commented , " It was great .... We got a preview of what to expect at the college , we found out where the facilities are , even found out about the city . " Another , referring to learning about the multicultural issues that surround Miami-Dade students , noted , " That was important to me . I 'm from the mid-west and not used to such diversity . " Still others spoke of " networking with other campus folks , with people from other departments . " <p> The original intent of the mentoring component of the project was to " integrate new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintended beneficiaries , however , seemed to be the mentors . One mentor described his new charge , " He 's so alive ; he 's a great model for what good teaching is .... I 'm getting so much out of mentoring him . " Another noted , " I sit in on their classes and they sit in on mine . I get observed every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday . I do n't know if I am doing anything differently . . . but maybe because I have more people observe me , I do my act a little better . I say to myself , ' What can I do today that they have n't already seen ? ' " A Teaching/Learning Center director says , " It 's like they get a shot of adrenaline . " <p> The Teaching/Learning Centers . Center directors design workshops and seminars based on faculty needs and interests . Several centers , for instance , focus on computer training . Training that relates to the advancement system , however , occurs at all centers . In addition , faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and course development . Mini-grants awarded through the centers to fund faculty-generated projects also help capture the potential for improving student learning in the classroom . As one instructor put it , " There are budgets for that now . " A colleague described his current efforts , " I 've submitted a proposal ... for a mini-grant for research in conjunction with a project going on in the U.S. Department of Education on new ways to evaluate student behavior . I want to try my ideas out in a pilot study . " Without reservation , faculty on all campuses agree that the centers provide opportunities to exchange ideas and make friends with people they might not otherwise see . One department chair noticed an even more direct result of the project and its centers : " Faculty are thinking a little more about ... whether their students are learning and how much . " The Advancement and Reward System <p> To complement the college 's faculty development program , faculty designed an advancement system that compensates faculty who emphasize teaching and learning . Widespread acceptance and ownership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were deemed so crucial that an outline of advancement system changes was brought before the faculty in a two-day referendum ( Cross , 1993 ) . In all , the committees worked on the project for five years before the final piece , the advancement system , was fully operational . As a way to demonstrate competency , faculty construct teaching portfolios , which are reviewed by faculty-dominated campus committees . Contract continuation , promotion , and tenure rests on the strength of these portfolios ( Edgerton , Hutchings , &; Quinlan , 1991 ) . <p> At three-year intervals , faculty prepare portfolios , which include annual performance reviews , student survey summaries and self-assessments for three years , optional peer reviews , and the answers to seven questions . The questions deal with issues of motivation , interpersonal skills , knowledge base , and knowledge base application and include the following : What challenging goals have I set for myself , and what progress have I made toward attaining them ? How do I motivate students or others whom I serve ? How do I interact positively with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducive to learning ? How do I update my own knowledge , professional skills and resources to make my instruction or service meaningful ( professional growth activities ) ? How do I meet or support the individual learning needs of students ? and , What information do I have that shows my students ' achievement or the effectiveness of my service ? ( Teaching/Learning Project , 1993 ) . <p> Answers must be documented with specific classroom-related materials . Classroom faculty add course syllabi , examples of tests and other assessment devices , descriptions of teaching strategies , and samples of student achievement or a description of how the teacher knows that his or her students have achieved . Nonclassroom faculty , for example librarians , provide samples of informational materials , discussions of applicable projects and activities , and substantiation of any of the classroom requirements that pertain to their specific situations ( Teaching/ Learning Project , 1993 ) . <p> The adequacy of portfolio preparation and assessment relies heavily on the teaching/learning center directors . As a part of professional development , faculty receive instruction on how to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct performance reviews . Faculty who serve on portfolio review committees , which assess the portfolios and then make contract and promotion recommendations , also undergo lengthy training . Portfolios prepared by new faculty seeking continuing contracts go before department-based committees . Promotion-related portfolios are reviewed by campus-wide committees . <p> Typical faculty reactions to the portfolio process go something like this , " We now have indicators , standards that establish teaching as a priority .... Standards that cross all teaching disciplines .... I am reviewing everything , I have to look at these originally 29 attributes , now questions from a different perspective , a different angle , and it keeps me on my toes . " Academic deans , who see all portfolios , agree that they detect a difference in the quality and the kinds of things that the new faculty , who have taken the graduate-level courses , submit  --  a level of sophistication in how they approach teaching that is absent in many of the portfolios submitted by tenured faculty . <p> To recognize teaching excellence , the college awards endowed teaching chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a college-wide one . Faculty compete for the endowed chair positions , and eligibility is restricted to full professors who have been at Miami-Dade for at least six years . As one faculty member explained , " Most colleges that offer endowed teaching chairs award them to people from outside the institution . They come in , visit for a year , get a lot of money , and then leave . What we 've done is start a program that rewards our own people for being good in the classroom . " Approximately one-third of the 100 three-year positions are awarded annually . Each chair carries with it a $5,000 yearly stipend plus $2,500 expenses per year , both to be used at the faculty member 's discretion ( Teaching/Learning Project , 1992 ) . To faculty at Miami-Dade , the $22,500 award is viewed as significant because pay levels historically have been too low to keep pace with cost of living increases in the Miami area . This situation , especially in the early 1990s , led increasing numbers of faculty to seek supplemental employment outside the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the classroom and overall education effectiveness . <p> To encourage the pursuit of advanced degrees , a specific doctoral program in higher education with two major areas  --  teaching and learning and college administration  --  is delivered by the University of Miami on-site for the first two years ( 30 credits ) to cohort groups of Miami-Dade professional staff . The remainder of the course work is taken at the University of Miami ( Deegan , 1990 ) . Although it no longer awards promotion and tenure based on degree attainment , Miami-Dade 's new advancement system still acknowledges the attainment of a doctoral degree as a form of excellence . It does so by adjusting the recipient 's base salary by $2,000 to reflect the accomplishment . From that point forward , all salary adjustments are made with this new base in mind . One faculty member commented , " The program allows us to earn a doctorate degree with very little expense ( we can count the two graduate courses ) and then rewards us when we 're done . " The Influence of the Project on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must consider its effect in areas like resource allocation , college personnel other than faculty , and operations and organizational decision-making . <p> Resource allocation . To encourage the participation of veteran faculty in portfolio preparation  --  especially those at the rank of full professor  --  in the system 's inaugural run ( spring 1992 ) , the college added a $3,500 increase to the base salary of those who successfully completed the process . In addition to the base salary increases , which directly affected the operating budget , fiscal resources were in some cases realigned to support the new processes and in others generated from outside sources . In its most active years when committee work was high , the project 's budget stood at $220,000 to 230,000 per year . As subcommittee activity diminished , the Teaching/Learning budget decreased proportionately . Overall , campus-specific staff development budgets , which are channeled through the Teaching/Learning Centers , increased by just under 20% . The college also pays all tuition and supply costs for those who enroll in the graduate courses ; and new faculty receive a stipend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duties . <p> Capital budgets for each campus were redirected to allow for constructing faculty offices  --  an issue raised early in the project by faculty . Historically , few had areas in which they could consult in private with students , and many felt that this inhibited their ability to deal effectively with their students . The cost to date is about $1 million for offices . In addition , the college built a privately supported $7.5 million endowment to fund the teaching chairs and a $108 million endowment , supported by a county tax referendum , to supplement state appropriations and dollars raised through tuition charges . <p> Personnel other than faculty . As the project progressed , employees in every work area of the college began to understand that how they performed their duties affected Miami-Dade 's learning environment . For instance , complaints about dirty classrooms , faulty equipment , and burned out light bulbs led faculty ( and later support staff ) to the realization that support staff had an important role to play ( McCabe &; Jenrette , 1990 ) . As a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either the same or similar professional development programs as do full-time faculty . Likewise , all new employees receive stipends to reimburse them for taking part in orientation programs , and each new employee benefits from college-sponsored mentor relationships , which extend anywhere from three months to one year . <p> In addition , staff and administrators now function under advancement systems similar to the one designed for full-time faculty and can gamer awards for outstanding contributions to the learning environment that resemble those earmarked for full-time faculty . Similarly , a two-tiered pay and support system for adjunct faculty , where those who wish to spend more time working with students would receive more money and higher levels of professional development , is currently under consideration . <p> Operations and organizational decision-making . As support staff became more active in the project , they also became more involved in college-wide decision-making . In 1992 , following their inclusion on the Teaching/Learning steering committee , support staff representatives were included , along with administrators and faculty , as voting members of the president 's council , Miami-Dade 's primary decision-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was reorganized to place more emphasis on teaching and learning . One vice presidential position was eliminated and a new one created , which tied institutional research , the Teaching/Learning Project , and Miami-Dade 's budgeting process together . In addition , campus leaders were given more autonomy in campus budgeting and personnel considerations and in determining individual campus direction . In its most recent move , the college expanded employee involvement in budget decisions . What Other Colleges Can Take From the Miami-Dade Experience <p> All organizations are unique . As such , they need not ( in fact , probably can not ) copy what Miami-Dade did . But two general insights gained from Miami-Dade 's experience may serve as a starting point for colleges that are striving to improve their teaching and learning environments . First , it appears that if an institution wants to affect what faculty do in the classroom , certain pedagogical and philosophical building blocks must be in place . This is particularly true when colleges address issues of academic achievement as it relates to an increasingly diverse student population . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution , holds important . In effect , they questioned the institution 's philosophical underpinnings . In articulating what Miami-Dade values , faculty , administrators , staff and students tied the concepts of learning , diversity , and quality into an inseparable strand that the institution has consciously sought to weave into the very fabric of the organization . Miami-Dadeans seldom speak of learning without digressing into a discussion of diversity and quality . Nor can they talk about quality without drawing the topics of diversity and education into the conversation . Whether other community colleges bind the same three imperatives together in a similar fashion may be less crucial than engaging in the act of determining what institutional members view as important and what their organization 's notion of quality is . <p> Richardson and Skinner ( 1991 ) wrote about three developmental stages through which institutions pass as they seek to increase access for nontraditional students . Colleges in the first stage do exactly that  --  in-crease access . They move into a second stage once they discover that granting access does not necessarily guarantee students ' academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student " and might include precollege academic assessment , mandatory course placement , a cadre of college preparatory courses , tutoring to bring the student up to speed academically , better academic advising , and improvement of the campus climate . In the third stage , colleges realize that they have done everything they can to the student and any increase in academic achievement is going to require a pedagogical shift on the part of faculty . In the case of Miami-Dade , the institution had spent the 10 years prior to the Teaching/Learning Project developing and implementing stage-two strategies . It had perfected placement , advising , and preparatory systems but still sensed that it needed to take another tack . With its stage-two reforms in place , the teaching and learning reforms pedagogically seemed a logical next step . Because faculty had participated in Miami-Dade 's stage-two reforms , they could philosophically accept and understand the significance of the Teaching/Learning Project . <p> The second lesson learned from the study at Miami-Dade is twofold . First , change is inevitable in all parts of the system when student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contain change . It seeps out , altering any long-standing practices that happen to lie in its path . Miami-Dade restructured its spending and decision-making policies and procedures to ensure that the college maintained its focus on the institution 's core  --  learning . It expanded its decision-making base to include staff , and it expanded the breadth of faculty and staff responsibility to include involvement in some financial decisions . As one instructor put it , " My perception in coming here was that consultation with faculty and staff on broad issues was the norm ; but now that I 'm here , I get the impression that this is not the case . I get the feeling that the discussions currently going on about the use of referendum funds for instance are a new experience . " The instructor continued , " It appears to me that the project is out in front of the rest of the institution and other things are just starting to develop . There 's sort of a cultural lag between the two . " An academic dean agreed that this increased involvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teaching/Learning . " Second , sometimes we have to jump-start change . Miami-Dade 's initially high participation probably stems from the pay incentives and requirements attached to the first portfolio go-round , enrollment in the graduate-level courses , and the college 's mentoring and orientation initiatives . Once faculty became involved as mentors in coursework and in the process of portfolio preparation , an intrinsic desire to improve became the driving force behind change in the classroom . Conclusion <p> In large , densely populated metropolitan regions across America , the nontraditional student is steadily becoming the typical enrollee in institutions of higher education  --  what was once the exception is increasingly the norm . For colleges and universities intent on meeting the challenges that such normalizing brings , it means reflecting inwardly on practices that affect the learning environment . Necessary steps include shifting the focus from a deficit perspective , which blames the students themselves for their academic defiencies , toward changes within the institution itself . In doing so , faculty , staff , and administrators , working collaboratively to improve the educational direction of the institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty , staff and administrators engage in their own learning , as demonstrated at Miami-Dade in its Teaching/Learning Project , they improve the learning experience of their students . They also model , in a powerful way , the value of learning . <p>
