Winters can be great here in the Rocky Mountains . The weather is never unrelentingly one way or another , but in a normal year we 'll see dank , Midwestern-style cold with sticky wet snow that freezes at night to a crust you can almost , but never quite , walk on ; dry , arctic cold with powder that eats snowshoes up to your knees ; and dark , airport-closing , pipe-splitting blizzards followed by blue stillnesses , which are followed by warm winds and unexpected thaws which , in turn , are followed by avalanches . Naturally , there are some thin-skinned types who whine about all this , but most of us just figure those people are victimized by deep character laws that are probably beyond their control . Unless we 're cooped up with them for long periods of time , we at least try to be polite . A good hard winter bodes well for water in the trout streams the following summer ( although a heavier than usual , runoff may postpone the trout fishing a little ) , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elk herds . At the same time , fresh time , fresh snow is helpful for tracking rabbits and hares ; the cold freezes the lakes so you can ice fish ; and low , wet clouds can make the late-season geese fly in range . Things are seldom perfect , but they 're often just as they should be , and there 's almost always some good in that . I like winter , and this is one point where my girlfriend Susan and I disagree . She 's a Spanish/Norwegian hybrid ; but the Spanish is dominant , so she does n't do well in the cold . I 'm a German/English mutt  --  strong on the German  --  so I do . One might last winter at 10 o'clock , it was exactly 10 degrees by the thermometer outside the kitchen but I guess I do n't mind that , even though it 's not energy efficient and therefore politically incorrect . I suppose there are some things I could do to winterize the place a little , but that would seriously cut into the hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun budget  --  and if there 's a single thing I 've learned in life , it 's that one must keep one 's priorities straight . I like winter and I like being out in it hunting , snow-shoeing , fly fishing in the handful of rivers that stay open  --  even ice fishing now and then . Susan says this is where I begin to flirt with that fine distinction between just being eccentric and being downright nuts . Granted , it does n't always look like fun to the objective observer . I 'll stumble home , beard encrusted with ice , face blue , feet and fingers numb , maybe with a dead rabbit or gamebird or some stiff fish , and she 'll just shake her head . Do n't get me wrong ; she loves to eat wild game and she 's always glad to see it , but when it comes to going out in the cold and wet to get it  --  and enjoying the trip  --  forget it . I guess it 's hard to explain ; doubly hard without getting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering conditions as they are , not beating them , but slipping in neatly and feeling at home . You want to get your share of rabbits , fish , geese , or whatever , so you ca n't mind a little normal discomfort . On the other hand , you know that while falling in the lake in shirtsleeves in July is one thing , going through the ice in four thick layers of clothing is another altogether . So beyond the satisfaction of getting where you want to go and collecting some game if you 're lucky , there 's the added satisfaction of being able to take care of yourself in a situation where some care must be taken . If you pay attention , you can learn such useful life-skills as caution , judgment , and how to feel confident within your own limitations . At some point  --  usually after you 've already made a few notable mistakes  --  you no longer have to ponder questions like : Am I a wuss if I go in now , or am I a fool if I stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking : if the question has come up , it means you should quit . A few weeks ago , when two friends and I spent nearly all day hunting and I shot the only snowshoe hare , I tried to explain the profound symbolism of it to Susan . " The thing is , " I said , " there will be hunger in the other lodges tonight . " " No there wo n't , " she said . " They 'll just call out for a pizza . " " Well , I mean , figuratively . " I 've noticed that about warm-weather people : their sense of poetry seizes up at about 40 degrees . Once she said , " You guys complain about the cold , too , you know . You come home and talk about how awful it was . " " Yeah , " I said , " That 's part of it : recognizing your human frailty in the face of higher natural powers . I guess it 's a man thing . " " Why is n't it a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you do n't suffer in the Bahamas , and suffering in the pursuit of sport is meaningful . If nothing else , some modest hardship seems to indicate that there 's a little more to this than just dim-witted fun , though how much more is a matter of personal choice . I have friends who feel that hunting , fishing , or just treking in harsh , difficult conditions can lead you directly to the true meaning of existence . And I have other friends who just say , " If you wan na shoot some geese , you 're probably gon na get a little cold . " I 'm afraid I tend toward the more serious side myself , especially in the winter when even active people spend too much of their indoor time thinking . The little deaths in sport seem even more real when you hurt a little yourself and when your own core temperature is a bit low . And if it takes all day to get one snowshoe hare  --  not to mention more burned calories than a 2-pound bunny can replace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just shows you how things really are : Modern comforts are an illusion ; in the real world , subsistence is a full-time job ; all food was once alive  --  and so on . Things like hunting and fishing are important because the big , dark hole of mortality is at the center of it all . See what I mean ? Serious . I enjoy my thoughtful friends  --  we have some great , long talks about this stuff  --  but in the winter , as I begin to drop into that pensive mood , I think I value those other guys a little more . You know , the ones who hunt and fish for no other reason than that they hunt and fish . The idea of Meaning with a capital M is not unknown to these people ; they just figure that if it 's really there it 'll eventually become evident . Meanwhile , one must be concerned with more practical things like warm boots , good gloves , sharp augers , bait , and ammunition . And it 's also probably good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of wine , warmth , and great meals with friends instead of some kind of grim enlightenment . I mean , the big , dark hole is always there , but you do n't have to keep staring into it . <p>
