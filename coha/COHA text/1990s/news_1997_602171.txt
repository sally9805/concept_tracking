<p> NEW YORK  --  For someone in the midst of writing and producing his first Broadway musical , Paul Simon seems eerily serene . <p> Detached , inscrutable , even sphinxlike , the 56-year-old idol of three generations of music lovers anticipates no all-night rewrites for The Capeman , his unorthodox musical about the redemption of a convicted killer . He has no fears of caustic demands or last-minute ultimatums from cigar-chomping producers . They have no power over him . <p> " There is no they , " he says with quiet confidence . " I 'm the they . " <p> Simon 's not about to let the most radical reinvention of his creative life be controlled by others . He 's one of three coproducers , having invested some of his own money in the hefty $ 11 million show . He also picked his own creative team , one new to Broadway : Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott and cutting-edge director/choreographer Mark Morris . <p> Though the show features Ruben Blades and Marc Anthony , its main claim to commerciality is a preliminary album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment , the show , which opens Jan. 8 , has a moderate $ 5 million in advance ticket sales  --  about half what the forthcoming musical Ragtime has . Simon is n't worried . " I do n't find this daunting , " he says at a recent rehearsal . " What 's the worst that can happen ? You fail ? You flop ? As hard as it is to keep this perspective as you approach the marketplace . . . it is about the process and the work . " <p> Some of those around Simon do n't quite buy it . He 's put too much into this show : Some 36 songs , some seven years of his life . He 's fired two directors and half of the 40-odd cast , and he 's lost much of the financial support he had from the venerable Nederlander company . And he 's not thinking he can fall back on being a pop star if Capeman does n't work . That part of his life is over , he says . He does n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tour , and I do n't want to perform anymore , " says the 12-time Grammy Award winner . " I did that in a way that was very satisfying . I gave it to myself as a gift , to go on the road , be everywhere for a year and a half , let everybody look at you and be the center of attention . But that was enough . <p> " Disappearing for six years was a distinct advantage in my life . These are very bad times to be famous . The culture of celebrity . . . is so completely wrong that it 's better not to be in it . It 's not like I was n't famous enough . " <p> Broadway seems like an odd answer to that dilemma . The birthplace of Hello Dolly ! is hardly a low-visibility venue ( though it 's also not where his admirers would look to find him ) . But after considering the alternatives  --  such as playing arenas  - -  Simon decided he likes the feel of 1,500-seat Broadway theaters . " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's storytelling size . " <p> Broadway has also become hipper and edgier , home to Rent and Bring in ' da Noise , Bring in ' da Funk as well as scores from pop stars like Pete Townshend ( The Who 's Tommy ) and Elton John ( The Lion King ) . Still , Simon 's subject matter goes further than any of them : The manhunt , capture , arrest and rehabilitation of Salvador Agron , who wore a Dracula-style cape ( hence the " Capeman " nickname ) and was part of The Vampires , a Puerto Rican gang . <p> In one of the most sensational news stories to come out of 1959 New York , Agron knifed two bystanders , apparently mistaking them for members of a rival gang . Saved from death row by then-governor Nelson Rockefeller , Agron matured in prison into an accomplished writer . He was paroled in 1979 , still swearing he did n't commit the murders , and died of a heart attack in 1986 . <p> " I 'm not for him or against him , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was guilty . " I 'm telling the story and posing this question : When does society say someone is morally redeemed ? <p> " Tony Hernandez ( Agron 's convicted sidekick , known as The Umbrella Man ) is alive , and I met him recently . Here 's a guy who is deeply contrite and saddened . He feels he 's ruined his life and , to a greater degree , the lives of the victims ' families . He feels that he has to pass on this information to his children  --  about what morality is and how people should behave toward each other . And that 's the only thing he can do to atone . " <p> Simon 's intentions could be easily misunderstood , as they were when he released his African- and Brazilian-flavored hit albums Graceland ( 1986 ) and Rhythm of the Saints ( 1989 ) . Critics accused him then of being a cultural carpetbagger . <p> New York 's Puerto Rican community is still leery of musicals after they way it was portrayed in West Side Story . And though Hernandez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and at least one local Hispanic columnist has given the show an endorsement ) , Simon has been slammed simply for being a non-Hispanic person writing about Hispanic people . <p> Black critics leveled similar complaints against George Gershwin for writing Porgy and Bess . But " I say that if somebody spends a lot of time thinking about a subject and invests themselves and their heart and soul , how else will people understand each other ? " Simon says . <p> Complex ideas  --  but his initial thoughts about translating them for Broadway were fairly simple . During his 1987 tour to promote Graceland , there were so many colorful , diverse guest performers onstage , a Broadway show seemed just a short step away . <p> That attitude gave him a context for creating musical theater  --  which he still considers to be an elaborate concert  --  but its naivete did n't serve him well . A number of collaborators and producers , including the Nederlander organization , were flummoxed by his approach  --  going to Puerto Rico for musical research , writing an album , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but highly exacting standards . <p> " He 's made mistakes along the way , " says co-producer Edgar Dobie , who worked for years with Andrew Lloyd Webber and was brought in earlier this year to make the production more viable . " He 's learning as he goes , and he 's learning the fine art of collaboration . When there 's a point that 's open and you ca n't reach any agreement , he 's deferring to his collaborators . " <p> Simon is philosophical about his lapses , artistic and otherwise : " You have to forgive yourself . Everybody misses . " <p> And at this point , Simon sees himself as having already won amid his jousting with Broadway . " This has been a tremendous gain for me . I collaborated with people whose work I admire and whose company I enjoy . Deep friendships have come out of this . It was an opportunity for me to grow and not have my last incarnation be Rhythm of the Saints . " <p> That last statement sounds valedictory , especially considering his relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to Edie Brickell and the birth of their two children . <p> Simon admits his future is nebulous . " The next thing to do is to shut it all down . Stop . Get quiet . And then , maybe begin again , slowly , to listen to music , maybe play a little guitar . <p> " I enjoy working . But you have to have a sense of deprivation in order to clean the slate . And if people have come to feel that when I do a piece of work , they 're going to enjoy it , the reason is because I do n't just go from one thing to another . I try to feel reinvigorated , to be touched by something . "
