<p> FIRST OF TWO PARTS <p> One week from today , California 's Proposition 13 goes on trial before the U.S. Supreme Court . <p> For exactly one hour , the nine justices in Washington will hear oral arguments in a suit brought by homeowner Stephanie Nordlinger against Los Angeles County Assessor James Hahn . She contends that the historic property tax law violates the Constitution by forcing her to pay 4 1/2 times more than neighbors who have owned their homes since 1975 . <p> A ruling , expected by June , could etch Proposition 13 in concrete  --  or it could set off a political firestorm to rival the one Howard Jarvis ignited when he helped draft the controversial 1978 tax reform initiative . <p> Although no one seems ready to predict with confidence how the case will be decided , attorneys , political figures and other experts generally agree on several key points : <p> * The case hinges on whether it is constitutional for a state to tax newcomers more than longtime property owners . Plaintiffs offer two reasons why it is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The odds slightly favor the defenders of Proposition 13 , but even a ruling against them should not mean a return to huge and escalating property tax bills . <p> * If the court overturns Proposition 13 , property taxes will become a defining political issue of 1992 and beyond that probably will produce one or more ballot initiatives in which longtime homeowners would hold the balance of power . <p> Nordlinger explicitly does not challenge the portion of Proposition 13 that limits property taxes to 1 percent of the assessed value . Nor is the state 's Gann spending limit , which prevents state and local spending from rising by more than inflation and population growth , under siege . <p> The only issue before the court is the section of Proposition 13 that limits increases in assessed values to 2 percent a year , except when a property changes hands or for new construction . In those cases , the property is reassessed at current market value . <p> California 's much debated property tax system is a product of the berserk inflationary climate of the 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week  --  in a stampede to buy today because the price was sure to go up tomorrow . <p> When the county assessor came by every third year , assessments could easily double or triple , yet tax rates did not decline to compensate . Longtime residents found themselves taxed out of their homes . Revenue grew even beyond state and local government 's capacity to spend it , leading to a $ 5 billion surplus . <p> While the Legislature fiddled , taxpayers burned . That 's when Howard Jarvis , the executive director of a Los Angeles apartment-owner association , and Paul Gann , a Sacramento developer , combined their individual anti-tax crusades . <p> In the highest turnout for a June election in California history , two-thirds of the voters ignored the consensus of elected officials and newspapers and put the Jarvis-Gann plan into law . <p> Many initiatives never achieve their intended result , but Proposition 13 decidedly did : Property tax collections fell nearly 50 percent in the first year . The California Tax Reform Association has estimated that if Proposition 13 had not passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 10 billion higher each year . <p> BIGGER REAL ESTATE BOOM <p> Less obviously , the new tax law and California 's real estate boom fed each other . University of California at Los Angeles economist David Shulman has estimated that if taxes on a $ 100,000 property went down $ 2,000 a year , the property value almost instantly rose $ 20,000 because the buyer could afford to put his or her tax savings into additional mortgage interest . Median home prices rose 42 percent in just two years . <p> The boom magnified the tax disparities between properties bought before and after 1975 , because the 2 percent inflation limit came nowhere near matching the rise in prices . <p> In the most extreme example cited by Nordlinger , owners of a coastal Los Angeles lot that recently changed hands pay 583 times more property taxes than owners of a neighboring lot that was purchased before 1975 . <p> These disparities , however dramatic , produced nothing more than grumbling until 1989 . Proposition 13 remained popular and was considered solidly legal . Even the liberal California Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RULING <p> The situation changed in January 1989 , when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously struck down the property tax system in Webster County , W.Va . The court held that the county violated the constitutional rights of the Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. by taxing the firm far more than companies that had owned their mines for a long time . <p> The court said the tax system failed to achieve the periodic " attainment of a rough equality of similarly situated property owners . " Such inequality , it said , violated the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which guarantees " equal protection of the laws . " Thomas Steele , an attorney with Morrison &; Foerster in San Francisco who was present during the oral argument in the Allegheny case , said the justices spent much of the hour quizzing the attorneys on Proposition 13 . <p> " My sense of it was that the court had clearly concluded that the situation in West Virginia was the kind of fundamental unfairness that ought not be tolerated . They were trying to right this wrong , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , " said Steele , a specialist in property tax law . <p> The court resolved the dilemma by punting . <p> In a footnote to his opinion , Chief Justice William Rehnquist explicitly stated that the court was not ruling on Proposition 13 . " We need not and do not decide whether the Webster County assessment method would stand on a different footing if it were the law of a state , generally applied , instead of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to be . " <p> The footnote sounded like an invitation , and R. H. Macy &; Co. and Stephanie Nordlinger both filed lawsuits challenging portions of Proposition 13 that were promptly turned down by state courts . <p> Last summer , the Supreme Court agreed to hear the Macy 's case , but the company abruptly dropped it after customers complained . The court accepted Nordlinger 's case in October . <p> ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST <p> The plaintiffs base their case on two legal grounds . <p> * First , they say , the court has already held that a similar tax system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court is whether the distinction ( between one assessor 's policy and a state law ) makes a difference , " said Ann Carlson , an attorney for Nordlinger . " We contend that it does not ( have constitutional significance ) . " <p> * Second , the plaintiffs argue that the disparities infringe an implied " right to travel " in the Constitution by discriminating against newcomers and people who move frequently . <p> Defenders of Proposition 13 think those comparisons are not relevant . They argue that there are three sound policies behind Proposition 13 : <p> * Tax predictability . All homeowners are treated equally because they are taxed at the identical level when they buy their property , and they know with certainty what their taxes will be from that date forward . As one attorney notes , the same people who today pay higher property taxes may change their minds someday because " seniority looks a lot better the older you get . " <p> * Ability to pay . The price someone pays for a property provides a much better indicator of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately reaches . That makes it much less likely that someone will be forced to sell a home because of inability to pay taxes . <p> * Revenue stability . Proposition 13 , despite its limit on rates and new assessments , has provided local governments with a predictable and steadily growing source of revenue , even in bad times when income and sales tax collections decline . <p> The California Taxpayers ' Association concludes that the post- Proposition 13 property tax collections are 5.8 times more stable than the personal income tax and 2.9 times more stable than the pre- Proposition 13 property tax . <p> HOW THE COURT THINKS <p> The defenders say that all they need to do to win is prove that there is a " rational basis " for Proposition 13 . " In tax cases , the U.S. Supreme Court is highly deferential to the state 's method of collecting revenue from its citizens , " said Jonathan Coupal , attorney for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association . <p> " If there 's a law that classifies people on the grounds of race or religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny " of such a statute , he said . " But if it 's economic legislation , the court will only engage in ' rational basis ' review . That level of review is the most deferential . It essentially says , if there 's any policy at all , even a stupid policy , we 're going to uphold it . " <p> Legal experts tend to believe that Proposition 13 will be upheld , although most of them say it is a close call . <p> " If the conservative majority follows usual practice of deferring to legislative judgment , then Proposition 13 will be saved , " said Charles Kelso , a professor of constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento . " There are slight odds that it will be saved , but I do n't think it 's a clear-cut situation at all . " <p> One reason why Proposition 13 could be overturned , attorneys say , is that the Rehnquist court may be attempting to stretch interpretations of the Constitution to include a category of " economic rights , " analogous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steele , who attended the oral argument in the West Virginia case : " I think that certainly the better odds are that the court will uphold Proposition 13 , but it 's clearly a serious choice . When I looked at those nine justices in the Allegheny case , they were clearly concerned about fairness . " <p> Tomorrow : What is likely to happen if Proposition 13 falls . <p> THE CHALLENGE TO CALIFORNIA 'S PROPOSITION 13 <p> The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments next week in a case brought by a Los Angeles homeowner challenging the unequal assessment of side - by- side properties under Proposition 13 . A final ruling by the court is expected by July . <p> . <p> WHAT PROPOSITION 13 DID : <p> Proposition 13 , passed overwhelmingly by California voters in 1978 , sharply reduced property taxes for commercial and residential property by constitutionally capping property tax rates at 1 percent . It also limited annual increases in property taxes to 2 percent  --  except for new construction or when property changes hands .
