<p> Someone is pounding on the front door . Inside the apartment , Mica , a brown Pomeranian springs into action . Racing up to the door to check out the noise , she turns , dashes across the living room , and scoots around a corner into the bedroom . There , a person hard of hearing lies in bed , unaware of the knocking . Mica nudges her to get her attention , then leads her from the bedroom to the front door , as if saying , " You have a visitor . " Mica does it all without uttering a bark . " Good girl ! " exclaims Rosie O'Connell , patting Mica for her flawless work and feeding her a treat . Ms. O'Connell is a dog trainer , and this scene is part of a staged learning session for Mica , with the trainer playing the role of a future owner and a volunteer playing the " visitor . " Mica 's impressive performance is one of many that take place on the " campus " of the National Education for Assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , as many as 26 dogs at a time are skillfully prepared to help not only people who are hearing-impaired , but also those in a wheelchair or using walking aids . Now entering its 20th year , NEADS is probably the oldest continuously operating place of its kind in the United States . The feeling it conveys is a combination of cleanliness , loving care , and businesslike realism . The kennels , with steel-mesh fencing and cement floors , are thoughtfully designed and managed . For new dogs , arriving here must be much likeyoungsters entering a new boarding school . Staff members know their boarders by names , personalities , and habits . They love them and are disappointed when a dog flunks out . The training program is a three-to-six-month process on average , leading up to when the new owners meet their dogs during an on-campus . For people who need one , " an assistance dog is like an extension of themselves , " says NEADS director Sheila O'Brien . Elizabeth Fanning , the high school volunteer who helped during Mica 's drill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to the people they stay with . When you see how it affects the personality of the owners , you know it really changes things . It 's a great experience to be here . " Although she calls her organization " Massachusetts ' best-kept secret , " Ms. O'Brien has become a world spokeswoman for these canine " partners , " as NEADS calls their dogs . " I 've just been invited to co-lead a delegation to South Africa , " she says , " as part of the President 's Citizen 's Ambassador Program . They asked me to lead one to China , but that was cancelled . South Africa wishes to extend their guide program for the blind by including hearing dogs for the deaf and service dogs . " NEADS gets about 75 percent of their dogs from pounds and shelters . The rest come from breeders and other sources . New arrivals are examined for health , disposition , and safety . The program is funded through a grass-roots campaign . " We do n't get any state or federal funds , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grants and help from private foundations . " NEADS also has a sponsorship fee of $ 5,000 , which most new owners can not afford , so the cost is raised from like communities , churches , and clubs . " But we do require that owners pay $ 300 , over a period of time if necessary , " says O'Brien . " We feel if they can not afford $ 300 , they ca n't afford to feed or maintain a dog . " The cost of training a dog like Mica averages out to about $ 7,700 . She is about to " graduate " and join her full-time owner . A bundle of disciplined eagerness , she bounds around the apartment - tireless and dependable - waiting impatiently for the next task . That comes when helper Elizabeth sets off an alarm clock . O'Connell lies on the couch in the role of Mica 's sleeping owner . Rosie 's reveille comes when Mica lands on her , a living alarm clock , to let her know it 's time to rise . But a grimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets off a smoke alarm in her hand , Mica dashes to the bedroom , arouses Rosie , and leads her to the front door . Mica gets praise and another treat . For service dogs , the training is distinctly different . To start with , a different kind of candidate is sought . Instead of the high-energy self-starter typical of hearing dogs - often poodles or terriers or a mix - service dogs tend to be golden retrievers or labrador retrievers . " The sound dogs have to think on their own , " says O'Connell . " If there 's a fire in the home , they ca n't wait to be motivated . But service dogs have to be more into the person . " Okay , I 'll please you . ' " If a baby cries at 2 a.m. , " the hearing dog has to get the deaf mother or father , " O'Brien adds , " whereas the service dogs are told what to do . " Yet training service dogs is also an intensive business . The reason for a big plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainer Allyson MacKenna brings two black labs in front of it . Each jumps up and repeatedly pulls its paw across the plastic , turning on the light in the process . Then trainer Allyson MacKenna sits in a wheelchair and drops wooden blocks on the floor . One of the labs picks them up , unbidden , and drops them in Ms. MacKenna 's lap . " And if someone falls from a wheelchair , " O'Brien explains , " it sets off the dog 's barking as an alert . " Service dogs pull wheelchairs up ramps and open doors for their owners . What is a typical reason for a dog flunking ? " It could be they 're too distractable - not focused on their work , " she says , " or it could a reliability reason . They could be too much dog for the person . We usually do n't have aggression problems , but sometimes if we feel they 'll be aggressive to cats , we 'll flunk them . " To ensure early detection of this tendency on a dog candidate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A deaf person or a person in a wheelchair can not make these dogs do anything , " says O'Brien . " The dogs have to love the work . If they do n't , I always say to the trainer , ' These dogs are telling you something . ' " Flunkees are in great demand . People have to sign up in advance to get one . Apollo , a German shepherd cross , recently flunked because " if there were a toy in the room , he would not answer any sounds , " O'Brien explains . But he promptly became a star at the nearby police drug enforcement unit . Does the full-time owner need to keep giving the dog goodies ? O'Brien is asked . " No , " she answers , " eventually the dog bonds to the person and does not need a treat - with the exception of ' answering ' the telephone . That has to be reinforced with a treat because you 're forced to ignore the dog when you pick up the phone . " Despite their well-honed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is even more important to their owners . " They have told us that the most important thing in a dog is not doing the job mechanically the best but being a social icebreaker , " she says . It gets people 's attention off the physical handicap and lets the owners interact more naturally with others . It 's a quality hard to train , one that springs from the nature of the assistance dog .
