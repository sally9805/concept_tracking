<p> At dusk , Wah Wong makes the rounds at his southwest Houston apartment complex . He 's not the gardener or the security guard . He is the Cat Man . <p> Wong , 33 , collects stray and abandoned cats , most of which he offers for adoption through the Homeless Pet Placement League , one of several agencies fighting pet overpopulation in Houston . <p> Animal shelters such as the Humane Society , the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , Citizens for Animal Protection and the city 's Bureau of Animal Regulation and Care know the toll : Year after year , 100,000 unwanted cats and dogs are dumped in Houston shelters , and 90,000 must be euthanized . <p> Death by injection . <p> Guilty of being born . <p> The Homeless Pet Placement League , a nonprofit organization founded in 1989 , is not a shelter , nor will it euthanize - unless an animal ca n't be saved . Instead , it accepts strays on one condition : those who bring them in for medical treatment must agree to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Atkins , the league 's sole paid member , says outside foster care is essential . <p> " " At first ( the league ) thought it could do everything , " she says . " " We just scarfed ( animals ) up from people . Then it became , ' I ca n't take another kitten , oh my God ! ' We realized it needs to be a joint effort . " HPPL pays veterinarians to spay or neuter the animal , deworm it , and give shots , exams and medical care . Then it 's returned to the foster parent , who can place it for adoption on any Saturday at one of several sites . <p> To date , the league has placed about 4,000 animals . The adoption fee of $ 60 , says Atkins , often is " " a drop in the bucket compared to what we 've done to put that animal back together . Our vets have done some amazing things . " <p> The league has 350 members who pay a minimum of $ 25 a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grants , even a concession stand at Rice University football games . <p> Foster parents need n't pay membership or vet bills . <p> Then there is Wah Wong , who pays his own vet to treat the cats he is fostering . It 's a personal decision . <p> " " I have no problem springing for $ 1,000 for emergency surgery , " he says . <p> Sacrificed , too , is an active social life . Wong used to hang glide on weekend trips to Austin . He 'd like to scuba dive once a year in the Caribbean . But he now has eight cats , three of which he offers weekly for adoption . <p> Wong routinely fed strays while growing up in New York City and later in Europe , where he was stationed with the Army . <p> In 1991 , he graduated from the University of Southwestern Louisiana with a degree in communications engineering and joined Texaco . He leased an apartment near Bellaire . <p> At work he became known as the Cat Man for accepting two felines from co-workers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I saw her lying out in the sun . She was young and female - so , of course , she was pregnant . " Alley 's four kittens were adopted through the pet league , but he kept her . " " That was going to be my last cat . I was at my limit - at least I thought so at the time . " <p> But more just wandered into his heart . <p> There was Bobcat , with a hernia and a urinary tract disorder . <p> Wong spent a grand on him - after a difficult catch - and kept him . <p> " " I chased him into a neighboring complex . I thought he was gone for good . He just showed up after a couple of months , and I trapped him . " <p> Wong owns a humane steel mesh trap . <p> He brought home Bubba , who promptly escaped . " " I guessed that 's the last I 'd see of him . One spring day I was sitting out on the stoop reading the paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I opened his mouth : ' Oh , you 're the same guy . ' " <p> Bubba also had a stomach tear , a urinary infection and diabetes . Wong kept him because he was unadoptable . <p> Arriving home from work one day , Wong noticed a cat flopping around helplessly in the parking lot , as if hit by a car . He raced it to his vet . <p> It was actually starving to death . Wong thinks it got left behind in an empty apartment . Scooter was placed on IV and now is up to 10 pounds . <p> Wheeler was a 2-month-old kitten coaxed out of a car wheel and covered with brake grease . Quasimoto stayed with Wong for a week before he had to be euthanized due to feline leukemia . <p> The hiding places in his complex are numerous - a horse trailer , a fenced-in electrical tower , the pool area , a storage shed , ground-floor back yards and rooftops . <p> " " Strays are afraid of activity . Right around dusk they start coming out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 3 a.m . That 's when they feel safe . " <p> They are invariably young and malnourished , dining on dumpster trash or field mice - or food that Wong leaves out . Yet for every cat he rescues , a positive cycle is set in motion . <p> " " Cats are territorial , so the more I take in , that allows other cats to wander into that complex . " <p> Wong attributes Houston 's pet surplus to a rural mentality . <p> " " Even though Houston is built up , it is spread out . People seem to feel it 's OK to leave animals out . " <p> Dogs , too , says Claudia Hoier , who has rescued canines for the pet league since 1991 . An office manager for Hale &; Co. insurance agency , Hoier does n't seek out strays ; they find her - like the purebred yellow Lab that turned up in her garage on Christmas Eve . <p> Hoier posts signs , takes out newspaper ads and contacts shelters in hopes of finding the owners of healthy-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and nobody 's ever looking for that animal . " <p> Foster parents seem to get involved gradually . Hoier turned to the Placement League after she " " tapped out " all her friends with strays . Atkins , a former school teacher , discovered the group after finding a dog roaming her school yard - a favorite dumping ground because kids might take them home , she says . <p> When Atkins tired of teaching , the league happened to need an administrative assistant . <p> " " I was looking for something that I thought was going to be easy , " she says , laughing . " " Well , I stopped carrying a briefcase and started carrying a Vari Kennel . " <p> Atkins deals with suffering animals through what she calls a " " farming attitude " developed while growing up in rural Wisconsin . <p> " " You bring me a bald , nasty-smelling , mangy puppy - that 's the kind of dog I can do something with . Or , you learn to distance yourself . ( Otherwise ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while ; they deal with enough emotion during the day . " <p> Like many volunteers , Atkins never thought she 'd get so involved . " " My parents had lots of pets . I swore that when I left home , when my cat dies , that 's it , no more animals . <p> " " Now I 'm worse than they are . " Two-thirds of the calls Atkins takes at the league 's North Shepherd office - shared with the Fund for Animals ' spay/neuter program - are from people who want to ditch a pet . <p> They can not be helped . <p> " " Since we only deal in stray or abandoned animals , people joke , ' Well , I 'm going to abandon it . ' I totally do n't have a sense of humor with that . " <p> If a pet must go , it should n't be given free to strangers , the league urges . Free kittens and puppies have been misused by unscrupulous people , the group warns . The league 's members agree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - even for house pets whose litters will be kept . <p> " " You might have five kittens in your home , but that means five more cats in shelters are being euthanized because there 's one less home for them , " Atkins says . <p> Until a better day , adopting or fostering strays is the only humane course , Wong says . <p> " " You do what you can . I really believe we can get the population under control in our lifetime . We 're in this to put ourselves out of business . " <p> The league offers pets for adoption 11 a.m. -5 p.m .
