RUN THAT AGAIN , " JACOBSON said . <p> The system obliged immediately , respectful of Jacobson 's priority . The image on the monitor reset to the first security checkpoint . Fish-eyed optics stared out through glass doors to a broad plaza lined with olive trees . The glass doors opened , and a single figure walked through uncertainly . The camera zoomed in , focused . The camera-robot 's point of view was only a few centimeters off the floor : the subject seemed to taper upwards , face all nostrils . <p> The robot scuttled backward on rubber treads . The figure framed in its camera-eye was clearly female now from the less extreme angle . The robot issued a command , repeated it . The woman followed hesitantly , glancing back toward the checkpoint and the glass doors and the sunlight beyond . <p> The robot 's servos whined . For a moment , the woman 's dark , frightened eyes stared straight into the camera . Jacobson flinched , as if she could see him watching . She brushed her long black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness and its familiarity . Her face was striking  --  fine , sharp-boned features with a distant , mournful look . But it was her walk that held Jacobson 's attention : tuned , exact , every movement under absolute control . The clean precision of her steps and the swing of her arms and hips made him realize how complex a process walking really was , and how badly most people did it . <p> The mild summer afternoon , still visible through the doors behind her , vanished as she turned a corner . She moved between white walls now , raked by fluorescent glare . The harsh light bled all the color from her narrow face ; the planes and angles of her cheekbones shone hard as knives . <p> Jacobson leaned back in his chair , tented his fingers . Except for the display , his office was dark . There were no windows , no carpeting , only blank enamel-white walls too distant to reflect the glow from the monitor . <p> " Subject 's name ? " Jacobson asked . He wondered why he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chance while browsing through the system . Her name was n't any of his business . <p> " Establish your need to know . " <p> " I have none . Tell me anyway . " <p> The system hesitated for a moment . " Julia Sholokov . " <p> " Why is she here ? " <p> " She 's a subject for robot articulation studies . Transferred from Santa Clara . " <p> " Ah , " said Jacobson . " Whose project ? " <p> " Kirkendahl 's . " <p> The woman reached the second checkpoint . A burly technician brushed her clothes , then directed her to step into a pair of white booties . She passed through a sighing airlock and ended up in a room with lockers along one wall . Another technician checked her ID card , pointed to a set of gleaming tiled showers and pantomimed changing into fresh white coveralls . He did n't say a word . Outer fringe staff avoided speaking to inbound personnel . Jacobson had never really understood why . Perhaps they did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps they assumed those coming inside were incapable of speech , confusing them with the robots they designed . <p> Julia removed her government-issue coveralls , glancing over at the technician before unsealing each seam . She need n't have bothered . He had his back to her . Fringe staff never looked inward . But the security robot 's camera-eye stared relentlessly at her slim , small-breasted body . It seemed asexual in the blue-white glare and rising steam . Even naked , she moved with a precise , fluid grace . <p> In the next room another technician scrubbed her suit down and fitted her with a hood and a filter mask that covered her mouth . <p> " What 's happening ? " she asked . Her voice was deeper than Jacobson expected , with a tense , vulnerable edge . The mask added a slight rasp . " Is there some kind of contamination ? " <p> The technician shook his head , friendlier than the others . Inside staff . " From here on in it 's a class 100 clean room environment . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlock , seemed disoriented for a second , then leaned forward into a roaring wind that stripped particles from her skin . <p> " Where is she going ? " Jacobson asked . Some quality in her posture , in her eyes drew his attention , something rare and terribly fragile . It made him feel protective . <p> " She has an interview with the director , " the system replied . Jacobson robbed his nose , wondering why . <p> The template waited in clear fluid , silicon carved to atomic precision . Bases drifted by , guanine , cytosine , adenine . Then thymine , the right one at last . It tumbled above the polished surface , gyrated , twisted , and finally dropped into an L-shaped depression on the template . Molecular locks clicked shut . <p> A stocky , fortyish woman nodded , and moved her hand across a touch-panel . " That was the last one . " <p> Jacobson paced between white walls , booties scuffing clean tiles . " Okay , Alice . Detach it . " He felt restless , distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the precise walk . <p> An electrical pulse set up a standing wave on the template . The strand it held rippled irritably for a time , unwilling to leave the surface . Finally it lifted clear . <p> " Encase it , " Jacobson said . " Use a T-4 phage sheath . I 'll be in my office . Let me know when you 're done . " <p> His assistant turned away from her monitor . She always sat too close to the display , and now it soaked her face in a dull amber glow . " Do n't you want to watch ? " <p> But Jacobson was already cycling through the airlock . <p> " Cue to the interview . " <p> The system complied . Julia walked through a sliding door into a bare room . The entire ceiling shone , achingly bright . The director stood near the back wall with his arms crossed . He wore a reflective fishbowl helmet and a loose white suit that disguised his slight build . The airlock door slid shut . Julia 's security robot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the confined space . <p> The director walked in a circle , his arms still crossed . <p> " Julia Sholokov ? " He spoke in a piping castrato tenor that lent his words an incongruous enthusiasm . <p> She nodded and looked around nervously , perhaps for some place to sit down . There was nothing . <p> " You 're a dancer , am I right ? " <p> " Yes . No . I was . I 'm an Associated Municipalities conscript now . " <p> The director waved her last comment aside . " Are you a good dancer ? " <p> She did n't answer for a second . " I suppose so . . . sir . " <p> He took a step closer to her . " Take off your suit . " <p> " Pardon me ? " <p> " Remove your coveralls , please . " <p> Jacobson froze , his face centimeters from the monitor . His fingers gripped the edge of his desk . What was the director doing ? He was a strange man : insular , unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd never shown any interest in women before , much less . . . <p> The image blurred , then refocused . Julia pushed the white suit down over her legs , her arms shaking noticeably . She reached up to touch her hair , for reassurance , and found only a plastic hood . <p> " Dance , " the director said . <p> She put her hands to her face . She may have been crying ; the robot 's optics were n't good enough to tell . <p> The director took a step closer . " You 'll be naked in the articulation lab . " <p> She looked up . " I will ? " <p> " Of course . We 're designing robots that mimic human movement . You 're their rule base , their teacher . Robots do n't wear clothes . " <p> She nodded tentatively . <p> " Dance , " he said . <p> After a minute she moved an arm to one side . She lifted to her toes , knelt . She closed her eyes , listening for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened one leg and posed , bent it again and turned . She kept her eyes tightly shut . <p> The director let her continue for several minutes . " All right , " he said abruptly . " Very good . " <p> She stopped . <p> " We had another woman in a month ago . Very nervous . She could n't stop shaking . You 're quite natural . " <p> Julia touched her cap again . " What happened to her ? " <p> " She 's dead . " <p> Jacobson tried to extract more information from that statement . He did n't remember the other woman , had n't ever met her . But the director 's voice conveyed no regret , no irony , no threat . Only fact . <p> His gaze was very steady , but it was impossible to tell where he was looking . Julia seemed uncertain whether to dress . <p> " How long will I have to stay here ? " she asked evenly , knowing she 'd earned a question . <p> The director seemed taken aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to ask Kirkendahl . He knows the details . " He locked his hands behind his back , finally looking away . " I imagine it 's difficult at first , coming in here . All the procedures , the discipline . There is n't a lot of that outside , is there ? Mandated decentralization , multiple governments vying for conscripts . What do they call it ? The Chaos ? We do n't see any of that . It 's clean here , orderly . You 're safe . Safer than anywhere else on Earth . There are n't any contaminants or carcinogens or ionizing radiation . There is n't a particle in the air larger than a virus . I ca n't even imagine going back out there now . None of us can . " <p> He faced her again . He seemed to be smiling beneath his helmet . " You can get dressed . I 'm sorry if I alarmed you . You have an important part to play in our work . I had to be sure of you . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wait a minute until his voice was steady . " Shut the damned thing off . " <p> Jacobson pushed back the chair at the end of the long table and stood up . Meetings made him restless . " Questions ? " he asked . <p> " Is anything happening with the microwave power proposal ? " <p> Jacobson looked down the table toward a young dreadlocked project manager . " Faultline Admin is still reviewing it ; that 's as much as I know . " <p> " They 've been reviewing it for three months . I have n't had anything to work on since July . " <p> Jacobson sighed . " I know . " <p> Alice Freeman , Jacobson 's assistant , raised her hand . " We 're down to six real projects and some maintenance stuff . How are we going to keep this place going ? " <p> The rest of the staff murmured nervously . <p> Jacobson robbed his forehead . Alice was right . Contracts had n't been coming in at the usual rate . Something was changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chaos . <p> " We 've been through this before , " Jacobson said . " The director always sees the trends , keeps us positioned , keeps us independent . He 's been doing it for ten years . " <p> " You 're putting a lot of faith in someone whose face none of us have ever seen , " Alice muttered . <p> " What 's he planning now ? Do you know ? " <p> Jacobson looked up . He was n't sure who had asked . It could have been any of the dozen nervous faces around the table . None of them , even the recent arrivals , could conceive of a life outside , in the chaos beyond the white walls . Jacobson least of all . <p> " The director has n't confided in me  --  " <p> A wall monitor brightened , resolving into a screen-filling view of the director 's helmet . His features moved elusively behind it . <p> Thank god , Jacobson thought . <p> The flute-like voice started in without preamble : " I know that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab . " <p> Several staff members spoke at once . <p> " When are we getting some new business ? " <p> " What 's going on outside ? We have less and less contact . " <p> The director stepped back from the camera . He had his hands locked behind his back . " I wanted to outline my plans for upgrading the central eight stages from class 100 to class 10 . " <p> " It 's a tape , " Greg Kirkendahl said , almost whining . " You ca n't even talk to the man in real-time . It 's dehumanizing . " <p> Jacobson looked from one tense face to the next , waiting for the clamor to subside . He knew what he had to say . He 'd tell them that the director was a genius , a magician with the power to keep the Chaos from touching his domain . They 'd believe him , accept whatever he said . <p> They did n't have a choice . <p> A THOUSAND LASER beams converged , green pin-points darting like startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at monitors where the pinpoints , isolated , defined arms , legs , a torso , a neck . But Jacobson watched the envelope of light itself , the miniature galaxy of blazing green stars . <p> " Okay , " said Kirkendahl , " turn toward me and lift your arm again . Keep the elbow bent . " He sounded distracted . His flat , nasal voice ran the words together . <p> Julia twisted around smoothly and lifted her arm . <p> " No . I 'm trying to get the interaction between the biceps and the brachialis . You have to flex your arm more . That 's better . Yes , just so . Once more . " He stood up ; a tall , angular man , unbending in sections , like a paper clip . " Okay . That 's enough . Let 's shut down for a while . " <p> The lasers vanished , and the nexus of light became a woman in a black skin suit trimmed , like a cabaret costume , with rows of tiny reflectors . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't offer his hand . No one touched inside . <p> " I 'm Alex Jacobson . " <p> She nodded slightly . Her face was closed , registering nothing . She 'd already learned a little about protecting herself . <p> " How long has this session been going ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know . Four or five hours . " <p> She looked different close up ; there was a softness to her face that the camera missed . Perspiration beaded above her eyes , at the borders of her mask . <p> " Kirkendahl can get absorbed , lose track . I 'll tell him to ease off . " <p> " I 'm doing fine , " she said coolly . <p> He looked straight at her , forcing her to look back . " I do n't think so . I do n't think ' fine ' is the right word at all . " <p> She searched his eyes for a moment , wondering whether to trust him . <p> " Can I get you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed beneath her mask , opened up . " Oh god , yes . " <p> The offer was consequential enough . He had to cycle through an airlock and a scrub station to return with a pair of squeeze boxes . Julia drained hers in one long pull . <p> " Thank you . Are you in charge or something ? " <p> Jacobson shook his head . " I 'm responsible for the science done here . That 's all . " <p> " That strange little man . . . he runs this place , then ? " <p> " The director , yes . His name is Blankman , but I think I 'm the only one who calls him that . " <p> " I met him on my first day . . . . " She shivered . " Can I go back to my room now ? " <p> " Of course . I 'll escort you . " <p> He spoke to Kirkendahl while she changed back into her coveralls . The tall man nodded rapidly a few times , then returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down a long white corridor . <p> " Why is n't there anything on the walls here ? " she asked . " It all looks the same . I walk and I walk , and I feel like I have n't moved . " <p> Her security robot paced them , squealing slightly . Its camera head swiveled . <p> " We have to keep particulates down . We ca n't give dust anywhere to collect . " <p> " Why do you all care so much about dust ? " <p> No one had ever asked him that . It took a minute to remember why . " We do a lot of silicon fabrication . We carve depressions in wafer surfaces the size of individual molecules . Ca n't let any particles settle . A dust grain looks like an asteroid at our scale . " <p> She pointed at the bare walls . " But does it have to be like this everywhere ? " <p> He stopped walking . The corridor narrowed to a vanishing point ahead of them . " No , not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You keep saying we . All of you ? " <p> " No . The director sets the policies . He takes a . . . special interest in the air quality in the lab . " <p> " The director again . " She closed her eyes . " He scarcely seems human . He told me that I 'd be naked in that . . . that robotics lab , or whatever it is . " <p> Jacobson shook his head . " That would n't make sense . You need a contrast between the laser reflectors and the background . " <p> " Was he being cruel or just ignorant ? " <p> The security robot rocked back and forth impatiently . Jacobson started walking again . <p> " Let 's talk about something else . " <p> She sighed . " What else can he do to me ? " <p> Jacobson thought about that . He 'd contrived a sort of life for himself here , between the white walls  --  a compromise , but what was n't ? He could imagine worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> He spoke carefully : " I 've stopped trying to guess what the director is likely to do . " <p> She smiled faintly beneath her mask and moved beside him . Their shoulders touched every few steps . He shivered with each contact . <p> " You 're building war machines here , are n't you ? That 's what your robots are . " <p> " Robots are n't weapons . " <p> " But they carry them . I 've seen robots patrolling the camp where I was stationed . Not much of a distinction . " <p> " It 's enough . " He shrugged uncomfortably . " Or it isn't. it does n't seem to matter here . We 're so insulated . There 's no connection to anything else . The Chaos ca n't reach us . " <p> " The director said almost the same thing . " <p> She was looking at him with . . . he was n't sure . Sympathy ? Horror ? The mask made it hard to tell . But he could guess what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their way of dealing with its gradual demolition of the infrastructure . Jacobson hid between white walls . <p> She stopped walking again , stared out at the infinity at the end of the corridor . She was right , Jacobson thought . They did n't seem to be moving . Like walking in a dream . <p> Her voice came from deep inside her . " This place is like my own private hell . I keep thinking I 'm dead . " <p> Her robot scooted ahead impatiently , its camera bobbing . She pointed at it : " You do n't have one of those horrid little machines following you . Everyone else seems to have one . " <p> Jacobson smiled , a crinkling of his eyes at the edge of his mask . " I designed them . Security knows it could n't trust anything a robot reported about me . " <p> A few minutes later they were at the door to her dormitory . They cycled through its airlock and into a long , narrow room with beds along one wall . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching a monitor . <p> Julia took off her mask and sat down on one of the beds . She looked very pale ; her red lips contrasted disturbingly with her skin . Unmasking was the most intimate of acts inside . Did she know that ? <p> " Can I get some books ? " she asked . " I never could get used to reading off a monitor . " <p> " No books . I 'm sorry . Dust . " <p> She nodded , but her dark eyes turned distant and lost . <p> A rabbit squatted in its sealed cage and looked out with soft , transparent eyes . <p> " It 's ready , " Alice said . She held up a vial of clear liquid . " Anticlimactic , really . " <p> They reviewed some details : simulations of a rabbit 's immune system interaction with their virus . Reaction kinetics . Nutritional requirements . <p> " Let 's just do it , " Jacobson said impatiently . <p> Alice nodded . " Would you like to perform the injection ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . All I 've ever done is program computers . " <p> Alice shook her head and prepared a syringe . <p> One of his demons popped onto the lab monitor . Jacobson cursed under his breath . Number 24  --  the alarm set to trigger if Julia was ever summoned to see the director . He made some excuse and strode back to his office , furious at the lethargy of the airlocks . <p> She was still two decontamination stages outward from the director 's office , being inoculated for something . At the last stage a scowling woman scrubbed her exposed skin until it shone . Finally , she cycled into the small , bare room . <p> The director stood with his back pressed against the wall . He seemed to be shaking . <p> " You wanted to see me ? " She was frightened , not hiding it well . <p> " Yes . Yes , I did . " He was silent for a moment . " Do you remember how you danced for me , the last time you were here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I 'll admit that . It 's unprofessional of me , I suppose . . . . " <p> Julia said nothing . <p> " But , you know , I 'm in here all day , just these bare walls and a monitor  --  " <p> " I thought the walls were your idea . " <p> " Yes , of course . They 're necessary . But still , the sensory deprivation . . . can you understand ? " <p> She shook her head . " I do n't understand any of this . " <p> He did n't seem to hear her . " Can you help a lonely man with too many responsibilities ? " <p> " How ? " <p> " Dance for me again ? " <p> She stood perfectly still , eyes unfocused . Jacobson found himself holding his breath , digging his fingers into his desktop . <p> " Do I have to undress ? " she asked . Her voice sounded very small against the roar of the recirculators . <p> " Please . " <p> Jacobson compressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make himself do it . <p> Julia unsealed her coveralls and stepped out of them , then did the same with her underwear . She put her arms out , starting to stretch . <p> " Your mask too , " the director said . <p> She slipped it slowly over her head . It took her three tries to disengage it . <p> " Shallow breaths , " the director said , stepping to the far comer of the room . " Take shallow breaths . " <p> She started to move : smooth warm-up poses first , then more disconnected , stylized combinations , tableaux and slashing transitions . She was trying to express something , Jacobson knew that much . Terror ? Hopelessness ? Anger ? <p> The director stood with his arms held rigidly at his sides . " Stop , " he said , after a few minutes . <p> She slowed , gradually coming to rest in one comer of the room . Perspiration dripped from her forehead , from her neck , from the place between her breasts . It dried quickly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The director walked toward her . He was shaking visibly now . He stopped a half a meter away , raised one gloved hand and touched her cheek . Julia turned her head ; Jacobson could n't see her face . The director 's hand moved down along her neck , paused for a second , traced one breast , then slid down to rest on her hip . <p> After a few seconds , the director stepped back to the center of the room . " Thank you , " he said awkwardly . " You can go now . " <p> Julia picked up her clothes , shivering violently , and stumbled into the airlock . <p> After eighteen days , most of the rabbit 's fur had fallen out . Its flesh had a mottled translucency . It looked like one of the skinned rodents Jacobson remembered seeing in butchers ' stalls during the early years of the Chaos . <p> " It 's beautiful , " the director said , watching from somewhere . " It 's perfect . " <p> Jacobson nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if in confirmation , the rabbit butted at the glass of its cage with its bullet-shaped head , then bared its teeth in frustration  --  teeth that shone with the dull glint of stainless steel . <p> " Maybe we can teach it to use automatic weapons . Save ourselves a lot of trouble with human experiments . " <p> " What ? " The director 's voice sounded shrill , even for him . <p> " Never mind . " Jacobson just wanted the conversation to end . <p> " I 've never heard you talk like this . " The director 's tone was smooth again . " Is something the matter ? " <p> Jacobson concentrated on keeping his voice steady . " Yes . I want you to leave Julia Sholokov alone . " <p> He heard the director breathing for a long moment , then only the hard silence of a severed connection . <p> " Come with me , " Jacobson said . " I 'll take you to where we can see the sun . " <p> Julia followed numbly , automatically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elevator , then entered a room with a table and several simple chairs . One side of the room had a square window , about a meter wide , triple-paned and heavily sealed along its edges . Julia ran to it and pressed her hands and her mask against the glass . The security robot trundled after her in exaggerated zags , trying for an unobstructed line of sight . <p> Outside , the sun was indeed visible off to one side , filtered by thin clouds . It hung above a line of brown , rolling hills . <p> " Is it morning or evening ? " she asked . <p> " Evening . " <p> " Is there a door somewhere ? Can we go outside ? " <p> Jacobson shook his head . " We 're deep inside here . Nine decontamination stages away from an exit . " <p> She still did n't understand what inside meant . Inside was a state of mind . Status in the lab hierarchy grew with in wardness , with the illusion of increasing safety and isolation . Administrators fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decontamination stations were installed to enhance the prestige of those working on their inward sides . <p> Disappointment registered on her face , darkening its shadows . " Can we stay here for a little while ? " <p> " As long as you like . But you have to talk to me . I 'm worried about you . " <p> " Why ? Why are you so interested ? " <p> It was a question he 'd often asked himself . He still only knew part of the answer : <p> " You still have the capacity for freedom . " <p> It was something he 'd lost , imperceptibly , during his years behind the white walls . " What did you do before you came here ? " he asked . <p> She kept looking out at the sky . " I was a conscript for Associated Municipalities . I cleaned the kitchen in one of their barracks . " <p> " Before that . " <p> She had to make an effort to remember . " I lived with my boyfriend and some other people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure why . There really is n't such a thing anymore . " <p> Jacobson pictured her apartment : shelves stuffed with books , pillows on the floor , house plants hanging from hooks . " What government were you with ? " <p> " We were signed up with Mountain View Unaligned , until the district boundary moved . That put us in the skirmish zone , officially , anyway . It did n't really mean much  --  there was a curfew and we saw patrols sometimes . But Mountain View Unaligned could n't service us became they 're supposed to be neutral  --  except that they were providing power and trash pickup during the sixty days it took for us to transfer to the Santa Clara Free State . " <p> Her voice had become a monotone . Boring , even to her . " One of our neighbors reported us  --  we were in violation of some neutrality provision of the Articles of Decentralization . That meant both governments had to suspend services . We could n't even use the street officially . Finally , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviced the districts on both sides of the skirmish line . That took us out of violation , but then AM suspended everyone 's contracts and drafted us . " <p> Jacobson nodded , not quite following all that . It was a pretty typical Chaos story . Everyone he met had one . After a few years , they all began to sound about the same . <p> " What happened to your boyfriend ? " <p> She shrugged . " He bought into AM 's story . They had big plans for him  --  he 's a district administrator or something now . He kept trying to tell me how important he was . " <p> Jacobson nodded again . Municipal employees spent a lot of time convincing themselves of their own significance . It was n't easy , most often . <p> " He was pretty much out of the picture by the time I was transferred here . Loss of status to be seen with the kitchen help , I guess . " <p> She turned her back to the window for the first time and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon . Her skin turned the color of honey . <p> " What about you ? " she asked . <p> Jacobson shrugged . " I build robots  --  mechanical , biological . Whatever we can get contracts for . " <p> He leaned against the window next to her . Despite the stinging showers and the disinfectants and the antibiotics , there was still a musky smell to her skin . He wanted to touch her face , follow the curve of her cheek , kiss her sad eyes . But he remembered the director 's hand moving over her shivering body , and he kept his distance . <p> " It 's been difficult , since the Chaos , " he said . " Robots used to build things . Now they destroy things , mostly . " His voice seemed to come from somewhere else , reedy and uncertain . " But I do n't know what else to do . " <p> She turned suddenly to face him . " That 's what this place does . It destroys whatever you love , it takes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My body used to need to do it . Now I feel ill every time I warm up . " <p> She looked straight into his eyes . " When are they going to let me out of here ? Nobody will tell me . Nobody but you will talk to me at all . " <p> Jacobson looked away . His mask felt suffocating . He was sure for a moment that something was wrong with it . <p> " Tell me ! " She dug her fingers into his arms . <p> " I do n't know , " he said miserably . " I 've never heard of anyone leaving . After a while you wo n't want to . You start thinking about the Chaos . . . . " <p> " That 's what the director said . He told me that my immune system deteriorates in this environment after a while . I 'd need intensive medical care if I went back outside  --  the kind that is n't available to conscripts . I 'd probably die in a few months . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says sounds so reasonable . But it 's all lies , is n't it ? " <p> " I 'm not sure . I 'm not an expert in immunology . . . . " The director knew everyone 's weaknesses . <p> " How can you work for him ? " <p> He did n't answer for a minute . " He gave me a place to build my robots . He gives me everything I need . " <p> Julia nodded , and Jacobson felt absurdly grateful for her understanding . She moved closer , until their concealed faces were only a few centimeters apart . <p> " I heard about your rabbit , " she said , " how you 've turned it into a robot . I 'd like to see it . " <p> " You heard what ? " <p> " I 'm almost invisible here . I hear everything . " <p> It 's true , he thought . There were n't any real secrets in the lab . There was n't much point . " I did n't think my work interested you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She spoke very clearly , with a slight quiver in her voice . <p> " All right . We can go down there now if you like . It 's an off-shift . The lab should be empty . " <p> Julia walked toward the door with a long last look at the dwindling light . <p> THE RABBIT paced in deliberate circles around the perimeter of its cage . From time to time the animal glared out at the peering humans . <p> Its skin was perfectly smooth , almost glossy . " It looks like a bath toy , " Julia said . <p> Jacobson laughed . " I wish I could take so benign a view . " <p> In fact , he did n't know how to see it . There was something shockingly unnatural about the metamorphosed creature . Yet it was unquestionably the greatest achievement of his career . <p> " It was a normal rabbit before you . . . ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What happened to it ? " <p> " We designed a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's skin and muscles with polymer . It replaced the calcium carbonate and phosphate in its bones with stainless steel . " <p> Jacobson walked over to a cabinet , opened a drawer . He took out a clear plastic block that held a tiny skeleton made of perfectly formed steel bones . <p> " An earlier effort . A mouse . I have dozens of different failures stored away in here . In a way , this one was actually too successful . The virus scavenged all the calcium . There was n't any left to regulate the hormonal system . " <p> She stared at the delicate metal bones , hypnotized . " How can that . . . other one live ? " <p> " Its central nervous system is intact , along with the liver and pancreas and bone marrow , and so on . One kind of polymer mimics the action of the actin-myosin fibers that change geometry when the muscles contract  --  ours curls up into helixes . The polymer is five times as strong as a real muscle . The bones have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wo n't the metal poison it ? " <p> He shook his head . " Orthopedic surgeons have been putting stainless steel pins and artificial joints in people for fifty years . The materials are inert . The metal is absorbed a few atoms at a time by the digestive system . Obviously , what we feed these animals is highly enriched in iron and chromium , but it 's below toxic levels . " <p> Julia watched the rabbit 's calm , measured walk . " Do that for me , " she said . <p> " Do what ? " <p> " Infect me with your virus . " <p> A chill started at the back of his neck . His hands gradually turned numb . " You ca n't be serious . The effect is permanent . I have no idea how long that animal can survive . And the virus wo n't work with humans . It 's tailored to a rabbit 's genetics . Your immune system will destroy it before it can even get started . " <p> She pointed at the rabbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had lived through fifteen years of the Chaos . " You said that thing is five times stronger than a normal animal . You have to be working on a human version . What other reason could there be for the project ? " <p> Jacobson turned away . " I should n't have brought you here . It 's crazy . This has nothing to do with you  --  " <p> She was on another track , not listening . " You 'll need test subjects . Whoever 's contracting for this must be planning to provide them . Conscripts  --  no one would volunteer . Is it Associated Municipalities ? It would n't surprise me . I 'm an AM conscript ; you could make it official . " <p> The lab was very quiet . The rush of air all around them obscured real sounds . Racks of equipment threw hard-edged shadows . She gently lifted off his mask , dropped it on the floor , then did the same with her own . She took his face between her hands . <p> " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft and calm . He flinched . <p> " I 'll kill myself , " she said . " Sooner or later . I ca n't stay in this place . " <p> Jacobson closed his eyes . Would she ? His skin burned where she touched it . She might . Or worse , he thought . She might end up like me . <p> " I 'll find some way to get you out , " he said , talking quickly . " I 'll arrange to get you transferred out of Associated Municipalities . . . . " <p> " Can you really do that ? " <p> She still held his face . He could n't move . <p> " No . Probably not . " <p> The rabbit stopped its pacing and looked up expectantly , sensing something . <p> " Julia , listen , please . Since I first saw you  --  before we even met , I 've been trying to protect you  --  " <p> " Yes or no , Alex ? " She blinked away tears . " Before the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her lovely , open face , nothing hidden , nothing untruthful or hard or cynical . With all the technology at his disposal , he had no other way to defend her from the director 's eccentric cruelty , from the white walls . It had come to that . His virus was the only protection he could offer . <p> He had to try twice before he could force himself to speak . " The process takes months . Years , really . It 's probably terribly painful . We really do n't know . " <p> She did n't answer . <p> " I 'll be monitoring you . If anything goes wrong , anything , I 'm giving you the antibody that kills the virus . " <p> She nodded slowly , her thoughts already elsewhere . She watched the rabbit ; fellow travelers . <p> " Alice will have to perform the procedure , " he went on . " You 'll have to take her into your confidence . Maybe she 'll be able to talk you out of it . " <p> Julia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plastic flesh . " Well my teeth turn to steel too ? " <p> Jacobson nodded dourly . " Yes . It does n't matter . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> He stepped back , away from the electric contact of her hands . " Because you never smile anyway . " <p> The director strode across his bare white room , legs stiff , hands clasped tightly behind his back , a fine edge of rage driving his step . <p> The room 's floor rose at a slight angle . The ceiling tilted down and the side walls angled in wards . The effect was a subtle distortion of perspective . As long as the director stayed at the back of the room , he looked taller . Obvious , really . Transparent . But Jacobson was certain that no one else noticed . <p> " Alex , do you have any idea how much power we consume ? " The question was rhetorical . Jacobson did n't bother to guess . <p> " Three hundred fifty-one gigawatt-hours every day . " Another dozen short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under one tenth of that . We 'd be able to keep life support going , maybe . " <p> " Is someone threatening to shut down our power ? " <p> " Not precisely . We 're on the University phantom grid . Berkeley 's reactors transfer the power we need onto the Contra Costa grid , and they transfer it to us . Contra Costa charges a fee of 0.03 in hard currency per kilowatt-hour to cover their life-cycle costs . They 're proposing to raise it to 0.60 . " <p> Jacobson nodded impatiently . This sort of thing was the director 's problem . He was n't sure where he fit in . <p> " That 's a lot of hard currency , Alex . More than enough to squeeze out our operating margin long term . " <p> The director always thought long term . It was his most refined skill . <p> " Who runs the Contra Costa power grid ? " <p> The director stopped walking , faced him . " It 's a collective . The principal partners are Faultline Admin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Our customers , yes . " He resumed his pacing . " It 's odd . They 've never challenged us before . Something 's changing out there , some balance is shifting . Still , you 'd think they would have more sense . We automated their main switching station and most of the outboard ones . We 're still networked with that system , I believe ? " <p> Jacobson nodded , finally seeing where the director was headed . " You 'd like them to have some technical difficulties ? " <p> " Nothing too catastrophic . " <p> Jacobson always felt awkward in the empty room . He did n't know what to do with his arms . He tried folding them , taking a stand . " I 'm reluctant to do that . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I do n't want to see your influence extend outside this building . " <p> The director closed his eyes . He actually seemed to be counting to ten . His reply was convincingly mild . " Either my influence goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a blood vessel begin to throb at the side of his head . Which was worse ? <p> The director still sounded calm , but his body was rigid , stretched tight . " Just send them a message for me , wo n't you ? " <p> Jacobson sighed . " As you wish . Is there anything else ? " <p> No answer . Jacobson headed for the airlock . He heard the director 's acute voice over the squeal of the door . " Alex . " Jacobson turned around . " Yes ? " <p> " I 'm all that stands between us and the Chaos . Remember that . Always remember that . " <p> Then the airlock clicked shut and air rushed in from all sides . <p> Her skin glistened in the green laser glare . It seemed unnaturally smooth , translucent , supple . She worked tirelessly , hours without resting dozens of flawless repetitions . <p> Jacobson waited until Kirkendahl 's preoccupied staff drifted out and the lights carne back on . Julia remained in position , seated , one leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> She came back slowly from wherever she 'd been , looked up . " I 'm a robot , teaching them how to build robots . I do n't suppose that 's occurred to anyone . " <p> " Kirkendahl does n't know what 's happening to you . I do n't think anyone does . Not yet , anyway . " <p> Julia shook her head . " The blind leading the blind . " She stood up , stretched . " You need to do another examination ? " <p> " Yes . At your convenience . " <p> She changed out of her glittering black suit and they walked back to Alice 's lab together . Her step seemed different , stiffer , more studied . The polymer was less flexible than skin . Perhaps that made a difference . Or perhaps she was still getting used to her new body . <p> " The tactile sense seems strange , " Julia said . <p> " Your nerve endings are intact , " Jacobson explained . " But they 're operating in a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She nodded , a little jerkily , then lapsed into thought . <p> After two months , the transformation of her muscles and flesh was half complete . The bones would take longer , two years or more altogether . Everything had gone better than Jacobson could have hoped . She claimed to feel nothing worse than a dull ache in her joints , though her face often seemed to betray symptoms far more intense . He kept expecting her to react with horror to the latest transformation , but the changes only made her more thoughtful . It was Jacobson who grew increasingly horrified . <p> They stepped through the airlock into the lab , and Julia shook off her haircap . Her head was perfectly smooth . <p> Jacobson gasped . " Your beautiful black hair . . . " <p> She laughed . " It 's been falling out for a week now . My head feels so light . " <p> He remembered the first day he saw her , touching the thick , dark braid for reassurance . <p> " Watch this ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the narrow space between lab benches . She cartwheeled , then flew two meters into the air , descending like a diver , back and legs forming one smooth arc . She landed slightly off-center , but recovered quickly . <p> " I never used to be any good at this . " She smiled broadly . " In another few weeks I 'll be the finest gymnast in the world . " <p> It does n't count , Jacobson thought . You have to be human for it to count . <p> " And look . " She picked up a steel dewer and squashed it flat with one hand . The flask whistled where its vacuum died . " You know , Alex ? " She was suddenly serene , staring out across the benches and glassware and the ultracentrifuges . " I do n't think I 'll ever be afraid again . " <p> The lights went out . <p> Machines spun ponderously to a halt . Monitors zagged to black . The howl of the air recirculators faded , leaving a ringing silence . Everyone stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts of the white walls . <p> Ten seconds passed , then ten more . Emergency lights flickered on . Fans whispered , rising in pitch . Jacobson sat by the monitor in his office , waiting for a call from the director . It did n't come for almost half an hour . <p> " I take it the Contra Costa power grid called your bluff , " Jacobson said mildly . <p> " I ca n't get the chairman to answer my calls . What did you do ? " The director sounded short of breath , chopping off the ends of his words . <p> " Nothing special . I dropped the voltage selectively in different neighborhoods . On the geographical display , the brownout spelled out an insult to the chairman 's mother . " <p> A moment passed , and the director began making a repetitive , high-pitched sound . <p> Dear god , Jacobson thought . He 's crying . <p> WITH THE corridors dim and the machines silent , Jacobson was astonished at how empty the lab seemed . Small clusters of junior staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside cameras - cameras that showed crowds of onlookers staring silently at the building . An occasional lone figure strode the hallways . But most of the workspaces and offices felt as if they had been deserted for centuries . <p> No one had actually left the building  --  the system assured him of that much  --  but as he walked restlessly past the labs and the commons rooms , he overheard fragments of a hundred hushed conversations that could concern no other subject . The meals in the cafeteria showed even less variety than usual , prepared largely from imperishables . Had supplies of food been cut off as well ? Cloistered in his office , staring at his blank monitor , even Jacobson had to wonder what would happen next . <p> " How long have you been sitting here in the dark ? " Julia asked . <p> He looked up calmly . For some reason , her sudden appearance had n't startled him at all . He 'd been waiting for her , he realized . Waiting for something . <p> " Your door was open . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb , unmasked . Her security robot lurked in the indistinct shadows at her feet . Her skin was translucent now , and the light shone through the edge of her silhouette , so that she seemed to be illuminated from within . <p> " What are your plans ? " Jacobson asked , trying to conceal his awe . <p> " I 'm leaving . The process is slowing down ; I can tell . I 've stopped feeling hungry when I look at a piece of rusty metal or a chrome-plated tool . " <p> " You 're leaving ? " he asked . He had n't really heard the rest . " No one can stop me . I doubt anyone will even try . " <p> " But your bones wo n't finish changing for months yet  --  " <p> " I know . It is n't important . I 'm ready now . " <p> Her voice sounded flat , metallic  --  the reduced flexibility of her vocal cords ?  --  but her confidence came through clearly enough . <p> He 'd lost her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comers of her mouth bunching up more than skin would , exaggerating her self-assurance . <p> " Come with me , Alex . " <p> He shook his head slowly . " After all this time , I do n't think I 'd know how to leave . " <p> " I 'll tell you how . " She leaned forward , put her hands on his desk . " Give yourself the virus . You know it works now . You know it 's safe . " <p> He turned away as if he 'd been struck . <p> " Alex , listen to me . You ca n't know how it feels  --  it 's like electricity , like fire . " Her voice pulled at him , fierce , seductive . " Come with me , " she said again . " You and I  --  we can live forever . " <p> For a lunatic , dislocated moment , he could imagine it : the two of them prowling the edge of the Chaos , spawning a new race . Smooth-skinned , steel-jointed , invincible . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut , blocking out the dark room , blocking out his monitor and Julia in her shroud of light . Nothing in his experience had prepared him to be an outlaw . He 'd chosen isolation , yes . But another kind  --  a monastic life , tranquility and order amid the torrent of the Chaos . <p> Jacobson stood and took both her hands . Her skin felt smooth , fragrant with the bittersweet perfume of hydrocarbons and lubricants . He shook his head . <p> She disengaged her hands gently . Her security robot whistled a page . " Julia Sholokov . " <p> She turned toward it , irritated . " What ? " <p> " The director would like to see you . " <p> She spoke very clearly : " Tell him to find someone else . " <p> The robot digested that for a moment . " Follow me , please . " <p> The machine set off toward the door . She ignored it . The robot stopped , reversed direction , and rolled back until it nearly touched the hem of her coveralls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit louder this time . <p> She stared straight into its camera for a moment . Almost casually , she swung her foot to the robot 's midsection . The machine lifted in a silent are and crashed sideways into the doorframe . It slid to the floor and pitched over onto its back , treads spinning . <p> Julia stood very straight and still , arms at her sides . She looked down at herself : " What do you think , Alex ? " <p> Jacobson heard a hint of her old vulnerability . It ignited a sudden hot flush of pride in his creation . <p> " Magnificent , " he said . " Nothing less . " <p> She smiled , framed for the last time in the doorway , charged with light . <p> " I want to see your face , " Jacobson said . <p> The director turned away from the camera , hands knotted behind his back . " What happened to her ? " he asked . " She seemed different , just before she left . " <p> Recent events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in small jerks . <p> " It does n't matter now , " Jacobson said mildly . <p> " Tell me ! " <p> Jacobson shrugged . " I treated her with my virus . You were . . . close to her . You must have noticed . " <p> The director seemed paralyzed . <p> " You do n't know much about women , do you. ? " <p> The director 's voice slid up in pitch again : " Shut up , Jacobson . " <p> " I wondered why you chose her . You 've always ignored the other women in the lab . You seemed afraid of them . But Julia had a dancer 's body , like a young girl 's . " <p> The director strode off the monitor , moving to a comer the camera could n't reach . <p> " Come back here , " Jacobson said . " I want to see your face . " <p> The thin voice came from far away : " I have to congratulate you , Alex . You 've succeeded beyond anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology as a catalyst for evolution  --  " <p> " Do n't change the subject , Blankman . " <p> The sound of the pacing footsteps stopped . " I want your virus , Alex . I want you to infect me . " <p> " What ? " <p> The director 's voice whistled with excitement . " I want to leave the lab . I want to find her . " <p> Jacobson felt something contract deep inside his chest . He pictured the director as a robot , a polymer and steel minotaur emerging from his labyrinth , abroad in the great wide world . . . <p> " Show me your face , " he said . <p> Hesitantly , the director moved into view . He put his hands to the side of his head , slowly lifted his helmet . A narrow , pale chin appeared , perfectly smooth . Next , concave cheeks with no hint of color . Finally , frightened blue eyes and a strand of sand-colored hair hanging down over a high forehead . It was the face of a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . grew up , " the director said quietly . " The stress of the first years of the Chaos . Poor diet . I do n't know . " <p> Jacobson nodded , feeling a crushing weariness . The helmet was better . He could hate the helmet . He could n't hate the face beneath it . " You 'll have to come out , " he said , " out as far as Alice Freeman 's lab . " <p> The director nodded . " When ? " <p> " Meet me there at 06:00 . " <p> That was two hours away ; time enough to decide what to do . <p> Jacobson had n't been so far outside in years . The glass doors of the main entrance were visible through an open airlock and a long corridor . The airlock was meaningless , but he hung back anyway out of force of habit . The airlock station and the front desk were unstaffed . Shabbily dressed civilians wandered along the corridors , staring quietly at the open doors and the white walls . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man in faded coveralls shuffled by , trailing particles . With the depletion of hard currency , the fringe staff had left , unwilling to accept central government scrip . But deeper inside , the lab 's activities were back to near their normal level . Jacobson appreciated the director 's administrative gifts all the more as the responsibilities gradually fell to him . <p> He walked back down the corridor , inward , tracing Julia 's route on her first day . The path seemed less surreal now , merely sterile and dull . He reached Kirkendahl 's lab through two open airlocks and another that was still in operation . Julia 's ghost haunted the room on a dozen monitors ; her dismembered limbs still turned and flexed in glowing wireframe green . <p> He walked through the labyrinth , past empty labs and dormitories , past dark power distribution stations and decontamination facilities . One technician guarded the last airlock . Jacobson nodded to her and cycled through . <p> The director stood propped against the far wall , his head slumped onto his chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulsing blood vessels showed through the skin of his face and one of his hands . He was unintentionally fascinating ; a sort of museum exhibit . <p> " The air tastes very stale , " the director said . His words came slowly , accompanied by a musical creaking . " I can hardly abide breathing it . " <p> " Your imagination , " Jacobson assured him . " The particle count is still below a thousand per cubic foot . " <p> The director shook his head infinitesimally . The effort caused him obvious pain . " Too high . Spores of the Chaos , blowing through the airlocks  --  like an infection . Leads to internal disorder . Inevitable . You 'll see . " <p> Jacobson nodded sadly , wishing that filtration equipment could really stop the Chaos . <p> " What did you do to me , Alex ? " <p> The question sounded surprisingly clear , as if he 'd been granted a final moment of lucidity . <p> " I inoculated you with one of the earlier strains . The polymer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The director 's eyes widened . With a shaking , agonized effort he brought one arm up and extended his index finger . Tears welled at the comers of his frozen eyes . <p> " Why , Alex ? We used to be friends . " <p> " I could n't let you leave . I could n't let you find Julia . " <p> The director 's extended hand curled slowly into a fist . The index finger began to bend , then separated with a singing crack . For a moment , the finger hung suspended in the bellow of the air recirculators . Then it smashed to the floor in a spray of plastic shards and lay glittering in the hard fluorescent glare from the white walls . <p> <p> By Stephen Kraus <p> " White Walls " is Stephen Kraus 's third sale to F &SF.; ( His other two appearances were " Behind the Barrier " in December , 1990 , and " In the Land of Grass " in August , 1992 . <p> He says the idea for " White Walls " came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a clean room where silicon wafers are fabricated for integrated circuits .
