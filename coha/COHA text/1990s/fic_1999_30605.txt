Chapter One : Bouquet " Dgotant ! " Monsieur and Madame Reynourd were easy-going people , if a bit disorganized . They shambled through their flat either half dressed or half undressed  --  Nula could never be sure in which direction their disarray was heading ; they left large sums of cash lying about ; they could never remember what plans had been agreed for the children that day . Already in their forties and each a stone overweight , they were nevertheless enveloped in a kind of ripe , luxuriant youthfulness . Paul played rugby on Sundays and came home soaked in sweat . Elizabeth wore her blouses virtually unbuttoned . She flirted with the husbands of friends and , accompanying Nula to the butcher and baker , even with the young shop assistants , on the au pair 's behalf . Nula nearly cowered behind her . At night in her room several stories above their flat , she lay awake and , against the current of intention , her thoughts drifted to the couple below and their seething sexual restlessness . The girls ' inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here on the second floor of the museum , within a glass case , a tree bloomed with stuffed tropical birds outlandishly feathered and preserved so close to the edge of life that Nula could , or thought she should , almost hear them singing , but what drew Marie 's attention was the device that recorded on a rolling scroll the humidity behind the glass . Nula shooed her away from it . The two girls began to jog toward an exhibit describing the construction of the Eiffel Tower and then  --  in a moment of insight  --  realized that the surface friction of the hall 's polished marble floors was less than the forward momentum of a little girl in new penny-loafers . They slid the rest of the way . " Marie ! Melanie ! Stop ! " Nula hissed . The young man ( an Algerian ? a Libyan ? ) approached , grinning . He had followed them into the museum and had been shadowing them through it . He had lurked near her in the dark of the astronomy exhibit , his bared teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had stared intently as she read to Marie the explanation of how an iron forge worked . " Come here , " she now called to the children , but , embarrassed in his presence , she called too softly for them to hear , or at least softly enough for them to pretend not to hear . " Well , you are a American ? " the Algerian confidently asked in uncertain English . " You are a student maybe . I am a student . Do you know Vincennes ? " " No . " Her education had gone no further than her secondary school leaving certificate . " My degree is almost finished , " he said . " I am two years at Jussieu , and now I am at Vincennes , at the Department of Sexology . " Nula did n't reply . She looked past him , at the children , who ignored her . " Do you know the sexology field ? Very fascinating field . We are the most foremost department in Europe and America . We include the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human relations . The whole gamut , as it were . Every academic discipline must include a contemplation of human sex , do n't you agree ? " Marie and Melanie , having exhausted their interest in nineteenth-century engineering , took another run and , squealing , slid out of the hall . Nula shook her head at the Algerian and took off after them at a brisk trot , mentally compiling a list of punishments , through one coolly lit hall after another , past the minerals exhibit and the insects and through the computer room , whose collection of computing instruments began with a Chinese abacus and ended with a model of a large punched card ordinateur dating from the Fourth Republic . Every time she thought she had lost their trail , she heard the girls giggle and shriek , and they 'd skitter through the door at the far end of the room . But then , when she was sure they had gone as far as they could into the dim recesses of the building , Nula found herself in a large , bright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her , as quiet and attentive as a pair of dolls . The au pair 's face was moist . She could feel the wetness above her lips . " Now you 'll catch it , " she said in English . She hunkered and roughly fastened a few buttons on Melanie 's blue school uniform that had come undone . " Mama will hear of this , I promise you . No television tonight . And do n't ask me to buy you cakes on the way home . You 've been very , very naughty . " But the girls were n't listening . Nula turned , looked up at the object of their attention , and gasped . The opposite wall contained a floor-to-ceiling backlit color transparency of a man and woman , standing shoulder to shoulder , completely naked . Their arms were at their sides , their private parts exposed . The couple were perched on a diving board and behind them were a range of forested hills and a rich blue sky . Their smiles were placid , as if they noticed neither each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's penis seemed small in relation to the rest of him ; the mossy equilateral between the woman 's legs was exceptionally black . Then Marie said something  --  Nula did n't hear what  --  to Melanie , and they both giggled . " Oh , this is biology , " Nula said , her mouth dry . " Come , let 's look at the rocket ships . " " We want to stay , " Marie told her . " We ca n't . " " Why not ? " " It 's boring , " Nula said . Marie and Melanie remained where they were . Nula took a few steps toward the exit , and the girls , less tentatively , went in the other direction . The entire hall was devoted to reproduction and sexuality . A film projection demonstrated amoebas splitting . A DNA spiral stairway climbed to the ceiling . Next to it , a plastic model the size of a school bus showed the pistil and stamens of an archetypical flower , accompanied by a softly buzzing mechanical bee suspended from wires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; another the egg-laying strategies of frogs ; a third showed two elephants mating . Side by side were similar exhibits explaining human reproduction , as if men and women were no more than rutting animals ( they 're no less , Elizabeth would say ) . Across from the elephants was a diagram of the developing human fetus , along with a picture of the completely naked mother , her breasts splayed , her belly distended , at the corresponding stages of pregnancy . An actual fetus floated in an amber liquid in a display case below the diagram . Nula 's two charges stood by it , making little trilling sounds of awe . Nula herself stared for a moment , shivered , and then remembered the girls . " Do n't you want to see the butterflies ? " But they had already moved on to the next exhibit , drawings of the human male and female at progressive ages , including labeled diagrams of their genitals . And , squatting by them , talking quickly and in earnest , was the Algerian ! The tawny skin between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt shone like the skin of a piece of fruit . Marie and Melanie listened attentively . " Monsieur ! " Nula cried . The girls snickered . " What are you doing ? What do you want ? " He stood and offered her a warm smile as she approached . " My little friends were asking of me some few questions . " " Their questions are not for you to answer , " she said . " Leave it to their mother . " " Madame  --  " he began , allowing a question mark to bob in the pause . But Nula said , " I 'm not their mother , " turned to the children , and briskly told them , " Let 's go . " Melanie danced away from under her arm . She joined her sister to stare into the next display case , their faces pressed against it . The idea of the dirt squeezing into the pores of the girls ' skin disgusted Nula . She glanced inside the case . It contained a variety of devices , accompanied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recognize a single one . " Look , here 's a playground ! " she said desperately , glimpsing a patch of green outside an open door around the corner . " Do n't you want to play ? " The two girls ignored her . Nula cooed , pleaded , and demanded  --  and finally bribed them outside with the promise of a bag of chestnuts . They held out for ice cream , and even then had to be shoved out the door . As they left , the Algerian winked at her . In the small park and sculpture garden adjacent to the museum , old men sitting on weathered benches gazed at the statuary ; couples strolled arm and arm along the park 's paths . Nula bought the girls two chocolate esquimaux from a vendor . " We have a half hour , " she told them . " Have fun . " She might as well have told them to do the following week 's homework . " Play , " she said , and finally they sulked off down a tightly manicured row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists . Nula was glad to be free of them for the moment . She could find a bench and relax , and perhaps enjoy an ice cream herself . The park was lovely . The flowers were in bloom , the day had turned fair . She wished they had come here from the start . The girls were too young for science . " Canadienne ? " She turned and glared at the Algerian standing beside her . He grinned . " You 're a terrible man to fill their ears with such filth , " she told him . " Filth ? " " The way you talk and they 're so young . " " But sex is part of life . " " I wo n't have it , " Nula said , her temper rising . " There 's a proper age for everything , and a proper way of learning about this . " " What age , what way did you learn it ? " " Sexology . I do n't believe there is such a thing . " " Are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The defiant admission made her flush . She had never told anyone this before . Yet she did not regret the confession : She enjoyed its recklessness . She had told the truth as if it did n't matter . The Algerian merely nodded his head in a professional manner . " Have you a boyfriend ? " " Go away . " " It is best , " he said pleasantly , " that the first time be with someone who understands the necessary gentleness and is also very expert . " " The first time will be with someone I love . " The Algerian 's shrug was nearly Gallic . " Why begin love with anxiety and frustration ? " " Where I come from , people look for romance . You do n't study that , do you ? " " On the contrary  --  " " If you do n't go I 'm calling the police . There 's a guard over there . Are your residency papers in order ? " Nula was looking directly into the Algerian 's face as she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still wore a smile , but his face had hardened around it , leaving his smile not too far from a grimace . The transformation revealed that he was hardly older than she was . The ridiculous cap on his head now looked like something he had to wear because he did n't own another . The youth started to speak  --  a retort , a challenge , something fierce  --  but he interrupted himself to say , " I 'm very regretful to have made a disturbance . " He abruptly turned , passed through the door into the museum , and disappeared around an exhibit devoted to venereal disease . The au pair strolled alone through the labyrinth of hedges and abstract statuary . She was angry at herself and embarrassed by her shrillness . She wished she had n't made the remark about the Algerian 's residence permit . There were many people in Paris who did n't have the proper papers , yet had nowhere else to go . And in the end , the Algerian had been harmless , even flattering . When was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a man had courted her with such persistence ? Of course , she had no choice but to ask him to leave ( she imagined telling Elizabeth ) , but ( she admitted ) she need n't have been unkind . Nula turned a corner and found Marie and Melanie studying a statue , smiles of delight and discovery playing on their faces . This cheered her . No matter what ugliness and corruption there was in this world , Paris 's beauty was fair compensation . She stepped beside the girls , gently running a hand through Melanie 's long hair , and examined the unusual , centaurlike mass of bronze . It suddenly resolved : a man behind a woman , both on their knees , his hands firmly gripping her hips . " It 's bad ! " she cried , pulling the girls away . " Bad ! We 're leaving now ! " Nula raced Marie and Melanie , momentarily silenced by her vehemence , down one lane and then another , past a dozen statues that only now were recognizable . Nearly every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that did n't , well they were much worse . Prire de ne pas laisser de dtritus , no littering , warned a sign along one path , and under the warning was the legend , Muse de I'Histoire Naturelle : Jardin de la Sexualit . " Do n't look , " Nula shrieked as they passed a grouping of marble figures demonstrating several forms of oral sex . As soon as they reached the street , Nula furiously cleaned the girls ' ice cream-smeared hands and faces with the premoistened towelettes she always carried in her purse . " You 're hurting me , " Marie whined . " Being clean does n't hurt . " " The woman was drinking the man 's pee-pee , " Melanie said . Her sister started to explain , but Nula shouted , " Shut your mouth ! " Marie replied with an obscenity . Someone called from across the street . " Mademoiselle , Mademoiselle ! " Nula , still on her haunches , did n't need to look up . " Bloody hell , " she muttered . " Mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He approached , breathing hard . " Accept my apology please for such misunderstanding that I made . " He thrust a bouquet in her face . Stunned , Nula rose and took the flowers , a clutch of white lilies , yellow peonies , tulips , and a single sunflower , wrapped in newspaper . The Algerian said , " I too look for romance . " Nula kept her lips pressed together , maintaining her expression of annoyance . " I want that you should see , " the man added . He removed a black vinyl wallet from his jeans . In it was his carte de sjour , his resident permit . On the card , under his long , unpronounceable family name and his twentieth arrondissement address , was a line reserved for his profession : tudiant . " I have right in Paris like you , " he told her . There was less rancor in this statement than pride . Nula had come to France on the ferry from Rosslare ; his journey had been much more difficult . " So you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Algerian and then at the flowers . Marie sniffed at the bouquet . " They 're nice , " she mumbled , dazed by his gallantry . " Well then . I now say farewell ladies . Farewell . " The Algerian , or perhaps he was a Libyan or even a Tunisian , bowed and straightened , then turned on the heels of his Adidas and hurried down the street . He did n't look back before he vanished around the corner . " Men like that , " Nula began to tell the girls , but she did n't complete the sentence . She really did n't know men like that at all . By the time they reached home , by way of a crowded , overheated train , Nula , Marie , and Melanie were exhausted . Madame Reynourd met them in the flat 's foyer and asked if they enjoyed the museum . Marie said it was boring , and she and her sister trudged off to their bedroom unbuttoning their school uniforms . " And how was your afternoon ? " Elizabeth asked Nula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that Elizabeth noticed the flowers , still in Nula 's hands , unwilted and fragrant despite the crush of the metro . Elizabeth raised her eyebrows in an expression of curious amusement . But Nula , surprised by her own reply , did n't wish to answer any more questions . She pushed past her , hurriedly explaining , " I must put these in some water . " Nula found a blue cut glass vase in the kitchen cabinet and ran the tap . She removed the cellotape and unfurled the newspaper . As the flowers shifted , an object fell from between their stalks and onto the tiled floor . It was a key chain , without keys , and attached to it was a small tag with a phone number written on it in a very tight , careful print , and a charm : an anatomically correct , dusky plastic phallus . Nula put her hands to her chest and shrieked , and she was sure the shriek reached every flat in the building , and into the concierge 's office , and onto the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Madame Reynourd came into the kitchen , it was with an unalarmed step and , when she saw what lay on the floor , it raised a soft , pleased smile .
