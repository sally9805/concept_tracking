Photograph // GALAXIES CAUSE ASTRONOMERS problems . They 're lumpy . And yet the earliest light we can see in the universe is smooth . So how did the universe go from smooth to lumpy , and how did galaxies form ? It 's one of the great questions of modern astrophysics and cosmology . For many astronomers , searching for the answer has been like the Quest for the Holy Grail , with potential answers constantly receding from view just as they have approached what they thought was the end . Finally , in the last couple of years , new developments may be showing us how galaxies , and the universe as we recognize it today , took form . We can finally look at galaxies - and perhaps their building blocks - within a few billion years of the Big Bang , and dimly glimpse what it all looked like . Fortunately , the picture is richer and more complex than most of the theories predicted . The Fossil Record To appreciate the origins of today 's ideas , we need to travel back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of galaxy formation based on an epochal 1962 paper by Olin Eggen , Donald Lynden-Bell , and Allan Sandage , who brought together information on the motions and chemical makeup of stars in our own corner of the Milky Way . They showed that the older stars , poorer in the heavy elements that have been created in the cores of later generations of stars , form a thicker , rounder distribution than the familiar , younger stars such as the sun . Because the form and extent of a star 's orbit is essentially frozen once the star has formed from interstellar gas , the paper argued , the oldest stars orbited in near circles around the galaxy 's center while younger stars formed later from the gas clouds that settled into the galaxy 's thin , rotating disk . This occurred because the galaxy was a sphere in its infancy , when the oldest stars formed , before the galaxy flattened out and formed the disk . Astronomers see so many old stars in giant , circular orbits that they must have formed relatively quickly . The galaxies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned . This so-called collapse picture suggests why we see different kinds of galaxies today . Consider the Hubble sequence for a moment . This classification scheme of elliptical , spiral , barred spiral , and irregular is still so widely used because it does more than Hubble originally intended , which was to describe galaxies on photographs . He used subclasses to indicate the degree of winding of spiral arms or the apparent shape of ellipticals . A galaxy 's Hubble type correlates nicely with the kinds of stars it contains , the amount and type of interstellar material it has , and even how its mass is concentrated toward the center . Elliptical galaxies are composed almost solely of old stars , lacking the cool gas needed to make more . Spirals have central bulges of old stars and disks where star formation continues . Irregulars seem to have been making stars at about the same pace for their whole histories . In the collapse picture , ellipticals are the galaxies that were most efficient , leaving almost no gas after their first spree of starbirth , while irregulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset and left almost all the gas for later . Because the bulges of spiral and elliptical galaxies are all more or less the same age , there must have been major fireworks in the early universe as all the galaxies contracted and made their first , brilliant generations of stars . It would have been a spectacular view , with galaxies larger , brighter , and much closer together than today , and studded with brilliant starforming regions and young star clusters - a time we might fondly wish for as we peer at the dim blurs of galaxies in our eyepieces . By the late 1960s astronomers were in a position to look for signs of how galaxies have evolved . Beyond this , some were thinking ahead to how primeval galaxies , or protogalaxies , might appear . The hunt for primeval galaxies , loosely defined as galaxies forming their first important generation of stars , has been a long-running quest of Arthurian proportions - and , some argue , just as embellished with myth . If most large galaxies really formed during a single short period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue stars , making the galaxies correspondingly powerful . If this were so , the sky would be peppered with primeval galaxies at about 20th magnitude . But these galaxies are nowhere to be found . To further confuse things , Leonard Searle and Robert Zinn showed in a 1978 study that the chemistry of star clusters in the Milky Way 's halo is too consistent to allow a single , smooth collapse like that envisioned by Eggen , Lynden-Bell , and Sandage . A single , smooth collapse would concentrate the elements cooked in massive stars toward the developing galaxy 's center as the gas dropped inward , while a lumpy collapse would blend the different materials widely . Because Searle and Zinn found a uniform distribution of heavy elements , they proposed that the galaxy formed not from a single , smoothly collapsing gas cloud , but from a very lumpy set of clouds already forming stars before they fell together . These lumps might look somewhat like dwarf galaxies . Photograph // If lumps continued accreting after they started making stars , the process might last a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense , galaxy formation by this process is still going on . In our neighborhood , astronomers still see examples of galaxies merging . When one of the galaxies is much smaller than the other , we tend not to dignify it as a merger , but as cannibalism - the galactic equivalent of a hostile takeover . If Searle and Zinn are correct , the early universe would have looked quite different , with many small galaxies swarming together at various rates instead of huge , full-grown galaxies all coming together at once . This also makes primeval galaxies fainter than we would have expected . They would have fewer of the brightest young stars at any one time , although the process would last longer . Telescopes as Time Machines The question for primeval galaxy hunters has become , " Where do you look ? " Virtually all astronomers agree that primeval galaxies must exist at high redshifts , extreme distances near the beginning of the observable universe . The light we see from them , then , has traveled since the universe 's earliest days . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest redshifts and learning about them by comparing their spectra and structures to those of nearby , familiar galaxies . The problem is that not all extremely faint galaxies are extremely distant . Many intrinsically faint galaxies lie closer to home . How can astronomers tell just which 24th-magnitude galaxy to spend a whole night researching ? Various groups of astronomers have taken different approaches to finding galaxies at high redshifts . One choice is to look at quasars , because they have long held the records for the most distant objects . This year 's record has a redshift , z , of 4.95 , meaning it lies more than 8 billion light-years distant . Clearly , quasars are intimately related to galaxies . They probably represent the energetic , unstable centers of infant galaxies . But at the highest redshifts , even the Hubble telescope fails to show galaxies surrounding quasars . More creatively , some astronomers have looked at objects directly in front of quasars , partly blocking their light at particular redshifts and introducing " dips " into the quasars " spectrum . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these contain carbon , silicon , and magnesium atoms and appear to have faint galaxies associated with them . While yielding only a few objects directly , this technique allows the selection of galaxies based on their gas content , not on how bright they are . Many radio galaxies are nearly as distant as quasars . In our neighborhood , spectacular double radio sources are associated almost exclusively with very bright galaxies . Thus , if astronomers see a tiny double radio source that matches a very faint object in visible light , the odds are good that the galaxy is in fact very distant and luminous . Radio galaxies from the 1960-vintage Third Cambridge ( 3C ) catalog have redshifts as large as z = 2.5 ( 7.4 billion light-years ) , and later surveys which go beyond the bright radio sources have turned up galaxies with redshifts as large as z = 4.25 ( 8 billion light-years ) . Going after radio sources provides a good way of finding galaxies distant enough that they must be very young . And some of these have bizarre forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything in our corner of the universe . These are so odd that astronomers must wonder what they can conclude about ordinary galaxies from them . Are they representative of later , normal galaxies , or are they such rare and extreme objects that they tell us only about themselves ? Galaxies by Radio Several groups have tried to circumvent this problem by looking at weak radio galaxies - those thousands of times less powerful than the high-redshift galaxies found by the 3C survey . These objects can be observed by the Very Large Array radio telescope in New Mexico . The unusual radio emission flags these distant galaxies , making them identifiable , and because they are so numerous the hope is they are likely to have become today 's run-of-the-mill galaxies , perhaps after a loud phase of adolescent rebellion . As astronomers had hoped , it proved possible to find many of these galaxies at redshifts above 1 , so they could start using them to examine galaxy evolution and , eventually , formation . Photograph // An especially interesting target was the galaxy 53W002 , which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a host of ground-based observations . The radio source , number 2 in the 53rd catalog from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in the Netherlands , was found by Rogier Windhorst . At 23rd magnitude , it 's faint enough that several years elapsed before Windhorst could get a spectrum showing measurable features , at a redshift z = 2.39 ( 7.3 billion light-years ) . Far and away the highest redshift found for any of his radio sources , the radio source was weak enough to offer a chance to see the properties of the stars in the surrounding galaxy clearly . Windhorst used the 4.4-meter Multiple Mirror Telescope in Arizona and the 5-meter Palomar telescope in California , which suggested that the stars in this galaxy are much younger than we see for nearby radio galaxies . But the structure of the galaxy eluded this work , since all the action takes place in a region not much more than an arcsecond across . I got to know this galaxy through a chance encounter over a coffee table at the Baltimore meeting of the International Astronomical Union in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could compare the spectrum of 53W002 , redshifted so strongly that Windhorst and his colleagues had measured only the deep ultraviolet part , with nearby radio galaxies , so we could see how they compared . At the time , this was possible only by using the International Ultraviolet Explorer satellite , which carried an 18-inch telescope and ultraviolet spectrometers in geosynchronous orbit . Our group observed the handful of radio galaxies close enough for measurements with IUE over the next three years , and found that indeed their stellar populations were normal for bright elliptical galaxies with or without radio sources . However , something rather different popped up in 53W002 - evidence of light from large numbers of hot , young stars . Was this the trail of galaxy formation , of the initial widespread epoch of starbirth ? Building Blocks at Last ? Clearly , more work needed to be done . Did 53W002 look like today 's elliptical galaxies , or did it have some other strange form ? The Hubble Space Telescope would help us find out . Our group was able to show that 53W002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its light falling off around the edges in just the way it does for nearby ellipticals , and not like spirals or irregular galaxies . The comparison was obvious . We had an elliptical galaxy of the same size and form as nearby ones such as M87 in Virgo , but loaded with much younger stars . Our group speculated at this point that we might be seeing part of a single collapse as hypothesized by Eggen , Lynden-Bell , and Sandage  --  stars had been forming , were still forming , in the telltale elliptical framework , but the spectrum , along with millimeterwave measurements , showed that lots of gas was still present . Photograph // More detailed images could naturally tell us more . Because orbital periods increase with distance from a galaxy 's center , the distance at which the stars have settled into a smooth , symmetric distribution can act as a crude clock . Images taken with several filters could show whether the stars started forming on the inside , outside , in patches , or everywhere at once . Our group obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue cloud associated with the radio source , probably caused by light from the nucleus reflecting off dust . It also suggested that the youngest , bluest stars were in the center , indicating a smooth collapse . The most interesting result from these data , though , hinged on serendipity . Windhorst 's continued observations with the Multiple Mirror Telescope included measuring spectra of brighter galaxies in the field for statistical purposes . Sam Pascarelle , a doctoral student , did this one night and followed the field closer to the horizon than is desirable . At this low elevation , atmospheric refraction moved another faint object into one of the several small spectrograph apertures , and Pascarelle immediately saw that it showed the same redshift as 53W002 . Subsequent Hubble observations allowed us to capture 17 objects at the same distance . Are these the long-sought protogalaxies ? If they are , we 're seeing a piece-by-piece buildup of several galaxies . These objects have the right structures to be ellipticals , but are much too small , taxing the ability of even Hubble 's camera to trace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smaller than we would expect the progenitors of galaxies in clusters to be . If this group represents normal galaxies at this stage in the universe , these objects must somehow grow - a lot - to become today 's bigger galaxies . A State of the Galaxies Report A new study by Lennox Cowie of the University of Hawaii and colleagues , using the Keck telescope , provides food for thought that may resolve some otherwise puzzling facts . This group finds evidence that the time needed to form galaxies ( and most of their stars ) corresponds to the brightness of a galaxy . The most massive galaxies may have finished the process by the time the universe was half its current age , and progressively smaller galaxies are continuing the process . But astronomers do n't yet know the ultimate answers . Beyond the cluster our group found , similar searches are turning up more possible primeval galaxies . Caltech 's Charles Steidel and his coworkers note that any substantial amount of interstellar hydrogen in a galaxy will chop out virtually all its light at wavelengths immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , a galaxy which is easy to see at red wavelengths but disappears going into the blue region is likely to be very distant , so that its deep-ultraviolet light shows up in the visible range . Steidel and coworkers have found galaxies at redshifts of up to z = 3.4 ( 7.8 billion lightyears ) in this way . Two more groups have searched the Hubble Deep Field data for even higher-redshift galaxies , with cutoffs redshifted into the near-infrared . Several such objects were found , but they are so faint that further spectroscopic confirmation is beyond present capabilities . Such searches may answer some of the big questions about how galaxies formed : Theories have predicted that galaxies should form big to small or small to big , depending on what gravitational and radiation processes were most important in the early universe . Which is Correct ? Even more crucial , and difficult to pin down , is the role of dark matter . Ample evidence exists that galaxies contain an enormous amount of unseen material , detected only by gravitational influence , and there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation - all that we can see went along for the ride . The precise nature of dark matter also controls just when galaxies started forming , and what the seeds were . The dark matter holds the key , and much of the mystery , then , to galaxy formation . How can we penetrate the desert between the microwave background , when the universe was less than a million years old , and the first quasars and galaxies astronomers can see , at ages of several billion years ? The answer will probably lie in the infrared and submillimeter regions of the spectrum , if for no other reason than the redshift from the expanding universe . What astronomers want to see here is light now shifted so far to the red that there is basically nothing to see in visible light . Photograph // A major step should come with the installation of Hubble 's first true infrared instrument , NICMOS . In principle , NICMOS will detect galaxies at redshifts almost 2.5 times greater than the current Hubble camera . Furthermore , it will see in unparalleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redshifted , so astronomers can compare near and distant objects . Impatient astronomers are already dreaming of the next generation of telescopes . One advisory panel to NASA has called for an orbiting telescope with aperture about 4 meters optimized for work deep into the infrared , and cooled for greater sensitivity . New technologies will be required to produce a system that stays cold enough to avoid seeing its own thermal infrared radiation , and can be operated reliably far enough away from Earth to avoid the planet 's own infrared glow . Conveniently , this instrument represents the next step in studying the formation and evolution of both galaxies and planetary systems . Seeing galaxies form and evolve is most important , perhaps , not for the details , but as the ultimate signal that ours is indeed an evolving universe . Few can be unmoved by the spectacle of the deep universe as unveiled in these deep images . Many more of them will be forthcoming from the electronic eyes of Hubble . The goal , though , is to do intellectually what these pictures lead us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led us here .
