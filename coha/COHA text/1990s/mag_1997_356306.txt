BRUCE HANDY , who wrote this week 's Star Wars cover story , was a 12-year-old growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area when he saw his first George Lucas film , the 1971 science-fiction feature THX-1138 . So when the story called for spending a day at Lucas ' Skywalker Ranch in Marin County , he jumped at the chance to interview his boyhood hero and watch him put the finishing touches on the " special edition " rerelease of the Star Wars trilogy . Handy remembers well when the original film came out in 1977 . " I must have seen it five times that summer , " he says . And how does the experience of viewing the movie today compare with his memories ? " The beginning seems a bit slow now , perhaps because we 're already familiar with the world it 's introducing , " he says . " But it still has that speedy kick at the end . " <P> KAREN TUMULTY knew when she was named our White House correspondent that she was in for a big change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for TIME for the past two years , reporters have access aplenty . " You run into Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich in the halls , " she says . The White House , by contrast , is tightly controlled . So to report this week 's profile of Franklin Raines , the man behind Clinton 's new budget , Tumulty had to find out what goes on inside by going outside  --  getting to Raines through the people who knew him before he went to Washington . Her challenge in the months ahead : keep finding those fresh angles . <P> DAVID VAN BIEMA , TIME 's religion writer , was looking for a way to write about the state of atheism in America when he became intrigued with an even more fascinating story : the bizarre disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair , America 's best-known nonbeliever . No one has seen O'Hair since , as legend has it , she walked away from an unfinished breakfast in August 1995 . Van Biema 's pursuit of the missing activist took him to Austin , Texas , where her organization has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicting one another . " Those discrepancies roused my curiosity , " he says , and formed the basis of this week 's exclusive piece . <P> CHRISTOPHER JOHN FARLEY , our pop-music critic , knows the angst of passing judgment on artists like his subject this week , singer Erykah Badu . So he was much relieved when his own debut novel , My Favorite War , won favorable reviews last year . " Fast , funny and furious , " is how the Boston Globe described his satirical yarn of a young African-American journalist ( not unlike Farley ) laboring for a national publication ( not unlike USA Today , his previous employer ) in Washington during the Gulf War . Now HBO has optioned My Favorite War for a made-for-cable movie , a prospect that can make even a veteran critic a bit starstruck . In Farley 's dream cast , his part is played by Will Smith ( Independence Day ) . " But with my luck , " says Farley , " I 'll get Dom DeLuise. "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
