DIED . LINDA EASTMAN MCCARTNEY , 56 , fetching photographer of ' 60s rockers who trounced the hopes of teenyboppers when she wed one of her dreamiest subjects , Beatle Paul ; after battling breast cancer ; in Tucson , Ariz . Their enduring union was the rule-proving exception to short-lived celebrity marriages , with the devoted couple spending just one voluntary night apart in their 29 years together . Linda became Paul 's muse ( the lovely , long-haired lady of his post-Beatles love ballads ) and his sometime singing partner in the soft-rock group Wings . Her passions ranged far beyond the musical : she continued to take pictures , and she became a tireless champion of animal rights as well as vegetarianism . <P> DIED .

CONSTANTINE KARAMANLIS , 91 , patriarchal former President and Prime Minister of Greece , nicknamed " God " by his countrymen and credited with restoring the country 's democracy in 1974 after seven years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens . A pragmatic autocrat , Karamanlis inspired impassioned devotion ; his 60 years in public office were marked by his efforts to align Greece with Europe , resulting in the country 's acceptance into the European Union in 1981.
