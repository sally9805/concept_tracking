We need a policy that covers all our workers , not just executives What you earn depends on what you learn . " Bill Clinton has intoned that line almost as a mantra since before he became President . " Nothing could be more important than getting Americans prepared for the increasing global competition , " Clinton said during the 1992 campaign . He seemed to really believe it , offering a scathing critique of the status quo . The theme was first expressed by Robert Reich , who would become Labor Secretary , and then enunciated in Clinton 's book Putting People First . There the candidate declared , " While our global competitors invest in their working people , seven of every 10 dollars American companies spend on employee training goes to those at the top of the corporate ladder . High-level executives float on golden parachutes to a cushy life while hardworking Americans are grounded without the skills they need . " After that , Clinton promised an " urgent " and " simple " solution : " We will require every employer to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , not just executives . " <P> It never happened . Reich 's view ( that a rising economy does not lift all boats ) became a quaint anachronism , as President Clinton tacked rightward . Today the Administration is wary of any proposal that might tinker with an economy performing better than ever . Unemployment , currently at 5.3% , is lower than at any other point in the past two decades . " Why mess with what 's working ? " says Budget Director Franklin Raines . " The growth rate is O.K. We should let things proceed as they are . " <P> Still , in a knowledge-based economy , vibrant growth depends most on innovation and worker competence . Clinton knows this in his gut , so he talks about " collapsing overlapping and outdated training programs into a G.I. Bill for America 's workers . " But even in its most ambitious iteration , the President 's current plan would basically target only displaced workers ; it would do little for the vast majority of employees whose wages are stagnant primarily because they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upgrade their skills and therefore their prospects . <P> " But merely going on as we are now could n't be more shortsighted , " says Rob Shapiro , the Progressive Policy Institute vice president who helped define the economic prescriptions Clinton embraced five years ago . In theory , the nation 's companies should understand this best and should therefore be leading the charge toward comprehensive training on the job . " Since better-trained workers are usually more productive , markets should provide all the incentives " for companies to make economically efficient training decisions , says Shapiro . Unfortunately , in the real world , businesses invest less in training their workers than logic would demand , mostly because workers are free to change jobs once their skills have been upgraded .
