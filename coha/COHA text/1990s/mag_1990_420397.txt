THE WORLD AT WAR <p> What would Europe ( and Britain ) have looked like if Hitler had won the war ? Michael Burleigh unveils a fascinating , if chilling panorama of megalomaniac architecture and social engineering . <p> Last winter , the popular press in Britain and elsewhere carried a number of features about the imminence of a Fourth Reich ' , in alarmist response to the prospect of German unification . Ironically at the same time , West German best-seller lists were dominated by a journalistic account of what would have happened if Hitler had won the war ' . In due course , reports of Ralph Giordano 's book filtered back into the British press , resulting in the odd juxtaposition of Hitler 's plans to demolish New York with five ton bombs or to abolish cricket , next to articles about German economic hegemony in present-day Europe . <p> What plans did the Nazis make in the conviction that they would win the war ? The first issue to establish concerns the range of Hitler 's ambitions , a subject about which there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lebensraum ( or , living space ' ) in the East , or was this merely ' the prerequisite for world domination ? Were his horizons essentially those of extreme annexationists in the First World War , or was the only brake he knew to be provided by crushing Allied economic and military superiority ? Some historians , notably Hugh Trevor-Roper and Eberhard Jackel insist that Hitler was a continentalist ' , with his final objective consisting of the acquisition of Lebensraum in the East and the resolution of the Jewish Question ' . Others , notably Gunter Moltmann , Milan Hunner , and Meier Michaelis have insisted that Hitler 's ambitions were globalist ' , that he was striving for world domination . <p> Of course , the two positions are not mutually exclusive , but rather reflect different emphases . The continentalists point to the frequency with which Hitler dilated upon the East , relegating his more expansive remarks to the world of fantasy ; the globalists piece together his more random utterances about colonies or a war with America and take them seriously . Some historians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a programme ' for aggression : <p> After the creation of a European continental empire buttressed by the conquest of Russia , a second stage of imperial expansion was to follow with the acquisition of complementary territory in Central Africa and a system of bases to support a strong surface fleet in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean . Germany , in alliance with Japan and if possible also Britain , would in the first place isolate the USA and confine it to the Western hemisphere . Then , in the next generation , there would be a battle of the continents ' in which the Germanic empire of the German nation ' would fight America for world supremacy . <p> Subsequent research , while not endorsing the notion of a programme ' , does appear to confirm that Hitler 's aims were global . It has drawn attention to Hermann Rauschning 's liberal , rather than literal , accounts of Hitler 's conversation in 1933-34 , accounts originally designed of course to deter fellow conservatives from their liaison dangereuse with Nazism . In this period shortly after the seizure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new Germany ' in Brazil and of taking over the Dutch colonial empire , Central Africa , and the whole of New Guinea ' . The allegedly dominant Anglo-Saxon influence in North America would be subverted as a preliminary step towards incorporating the United States into the German World Empire ' . These objectives were accompanied by quasi-messianic declarations of intent about recasting the world ' , or the liberation ' of mankind from the restraints of intellect , freedom , and morality . <p> Hitler and his associates returned to these themes during the first flush of victory . In 1940 Ribbentrop and officials in the Foreign Ministry were thinking of augmenting the Greater European economic sphere ' with a supplementary colonial area ' carved from British and French West Africa , French Equatorial Africa , the Belgian Congo , Uganda , Kenya , Zanzibar and Northern Rhodesia , with Madagascar acquired for the purpose of resettling ' the Jews . The Racial Political Office of the NSDAP began detailed planning for the creation of colonial regimes in Africa and for the regulation of relations between whites and blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no guarantee against attack . Operation Tannenbaum ' was designed to conquer Switzerland , which was to be divided between its neighbours ; Operation Polar Fox ' would secure the iron ore reserves of Sweden ; while operations Isabella ' and Felix ' would secure respectively Portugal and Gibraltar , in the latter case with or without the consent of the Spanish Generalissimo . <p> Although Operation Sealion ' was never mounted , the immediate future of the British Isles can be partially deduced from a cluster of draft decrees and police instructions . Each of the three invading armies was to control its captured territory . The officials of the Defence Economic Command were to strip the country of raw materials and strategic equipment . Able-bodied males between seventeen and forty-five were to be interned and then shipped to the Continent as forced labour . Strikers , demonstrators , and anyone possessing firearms were to be summarily dealt with by military courts . A thirty-one year-old Berlin political science professor , Alfred Six , was to head SS operations from London , equipped with Special Branch files and assisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool , Manchester and Edinburgh Nearly 3,000 people were named on an SS Special Search List ' , including Churchill , Eden , Masaryk , Benes , de Gaulle , the art historian Fritz Saxl , publisher Victor Gollancz , Noel Coward , and the refugee Hermann Rauschning . The lists were not up to date for they included Sigmund Freud who had died a year earlier . In the event , Six arrived in Smolensk rather than London , where he massacred many Soviet commissars . Gaoled for twenty years for war crimes in 1948 , he was released in 1952 , joining the management of Porsche and the incipient West German secret service . <p> Hitler persisted in the delusion that Britain would accept German leadership in a revitalised ' Europe , turning with Germany upon the USA : <p> I shall no longer be there to see it , but I rejoice on behalf of the German people at the idea that one day we will see England and Germany marching together against America . <p> In the event that neither the prospect of an alliance with Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , Hitler seems to have seriously considered transatlantic aggression . He toyed with the idea of air-strikes against America from bases in the Azores and Canarv Islands , commissioning the development by Messerschmidt of four-engine bombers , capable of delivering eight-ton payloads at a range of 11-15,000 kilometres . <p> Ambitions beyond Europe were also apparent in his special Z plan ' naval directive of January 27th 1939 , for a fleet which by 1944-46 would be capable of challenging any power on the high seas from its vast base at Trondheim . The 800 ships were to include 100 000-ton battleships with a length of over 300 metres and guns of 53 cm calibre . In sum , there is some evidence that Hitler 's objectives were without limit , although these long-range fantasies of power and dominion were necessarily marginalised by worsening strategic realities . They were not hampered by questions of cost , human or otherwise , for war had a positive , regenerative , value for the health ' of the race and nation . As he said , We may have a hundred years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it will prevent us from going to sleep . ' <p> While some historians have emphasised the geographical scope of Nazi ambitions , others notably Jochen Thies  --  have tried to deduce ultimate intentions from the regime 's actual or planned architectural legacy . Hitler , the failed architecture student and small-town bohemian , was obsessed with architectural planning . During the last weeks of the war , with Soviet soldiers scuttling through the debris of Berlin , he apparently spent much of the time reshuffling architectural models in the glare of spotlights positioned to simulate sunlight . The main purpose of Hitler 's architecture was to overawe through excesses of scale and to give his regime the aura of power and permanence . The inhuman intention of reducing human beings to the scale of Liliputians should not be lost sight of amidst apologetic , aesthetic , reappraisals . Hitler made his views on the function of architecture quite clear when he remarked in 1941 , Those who enter the Reich Chancellery should feel that they stand before the lords of the world ' . He gave this a characteristically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia : <p> If there is a revolution , all we shall need to do is drop a few bombs on their towns and that 's that . Then once a year , a troop of Kirghiz will be led through the Reich capital in order that they may fill their minds with the power and the grandeur of its stone monuments . <p> This need to overawe was accompanied with an obsession with scale which bordered on the infantile . Musing with Himmler in 1941 , Hitler remarked : <p> Nothing will be too good for the beautification of Berlin . . . One will arrive there along wide avenues containing the Triumphal Arch , the Pantheon of the Army , the Square of the people  --  things to take your breath away ! It 's only thus that we shall succeed in eclipsing our only rival in the world , Rome . Let it be built on such a scale that St. Peter 's and its Square will seem like toys in comparison ! <p> Similar competitive gigantomania was evident in his plans for the redevelopment of Hamburg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elbe , with pylons soaring to 180 metres . He explained the project to his army commanders as follows : <p> You will perhaps ask : Why do n't you build a tunnel ? I do n't consider a tunnel useful . But even if I did , I would still have the largest bridge in the world erected in Hamburg , so that any German coming from atroad or who has the opportunity to compare Germany with other countries must say to himself What is so extraordinary about America and its bridges ? We can do the same ' . That is why I am having skyscrapers built which will be just as impressive ' as the American ones . <p> The skyscrapers included a new NSDAP Regional Headquarters , designed to relegate the Empire State Building in the league table of tallest buildings . Some idea of the scale is conveyed by the fact that due to the poor sub-soil , the structure had to be reduced by 250 metres . Modernity and megalymania were to be conjoined in a gigantic neon swastika on top of the building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The largest buildings were inevitably reserved for Berlin , which in 1950 , when building work was complete , would be rechristened Germania ' . The city , whose population of ten million would outnumber New York , Paris or London , was to be rebuilt around a vast axial grid , whose avenues would be over 100 metres wide . Emerging from railway terminals larger than Grand Central Station , the visitor would be confronted by wide vistas and enormous marble-clad buildings . A triumphal arch , double the height and breadth of Napoleon 's Arc de Triomphe , would be inscribed with the names of the fallen , while defunct enemy weaponry would be displayed on plinths erected for the purpose . Passing the new Fuhrer Palace ' , equipped with a dining hall for thousands and a private theatre , the visitor would arrive at the Great Hall , billed as the largest assembly hall in the world . With a capacity of a quarter of a million , the light in the cupola could alone encircle the dome of the Pantheon , the condensation thus raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metres from the ground , a lantern supported an eagle perched at first upon a swastika , and then in the revised version , upon the globe . <p> These buildings , and the parade grounds that went with them , were to be the stage for the choreography of millions : marching , singing , acclaiming seas of people , beneath the glacial shafts of a hundred searchlights . Collective sensation and the artificial emotionalism of a revivalist meeting was to replace the last vestiges of rational political culture . These buildings were also intended to last . Rather too optimistically Hitler once remarked : <p> Granite will ensure that our monuments will last for ever . In ten thousand years they 'll be still standing just as they are , unless meanwhile the sea has again covered our plains . <p> The materials largely came from a new generation of concentration camps , established by the SS in the vicinity of stone quarries . Beyond Germany , architectural planning became a matter of Wilhelm Kreis ' monuments to the dead which were to punctuate the landscape from Africa to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major changes to Europe 's infrastructure . Canals would bring the grain and petroleum of Russia along the Danube , and three-lane motorways would enable German tourists to speed along in their Volkswagens from Calais to Warsaw or Klagenfurt to Trondheim . In early 1942 , Hitler and his chief engineer , Fritz Todt , began plans for a four-metre-gauge railway , which would convey double-decker trains at 120 miles an hour to the Caspian Sea and the Urals . Sometime after the defeats at Stalingrad and Kursk , Hitler was still designing saloon and dining cars to take ethnic German settlers to and fro in Russia . <p> In the Table Talk , the record of Hitler 's late night ruminations on , inter alia , the Aryan Jesus , the Pharaohs , prehistoric dogs , the Ice Age and the soup drunk by the Spartans , he frequently expanded on his plans for the East , an area which simultaneously attracted and repelled him . The model for German rule in what had been Russia was , as he never tired of repeating , the British empire in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two hundred and fifty thousand men in all , including fifty thousand soldiers , govern four hundred million Indians ' , or again , The Russian space is our India . Like the English we shall rule this empire with a handful of men ' . As for the future of Russia , Hitler dwelt on this one night in August 1942 : <p> The foundation of St Petersburg by Peter the Great was a fatal event in the history of Europe ; and St Petersburg must therefore disappear utterly from the earth 's surface . Moscow , too . Then the Russians will return into Siberia . . . As for the ridiculous hundred million Slavs , we will mould the best of them to the shape that suits us , and we will isolate the rest of them in their own pig-styes ; and anyone who talks about cherishing the local inhabitant and civilising him , goes straight off into a concentration camp ! <p> Grand plans for the East were submitted by a host of academic enthusiasts , and more seriously , by their colleagues in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konrad Meyer 's General Plan East ' , whose essentials were endorsed by both Himmler and Hitler . The broad purpose of the various versions of the plan was to germanise ' the vast areas occupied by German forces . This was to be done by deporting thirty-one of the forty-five million inhabitants of Eastern Europe to Siberia . These figures , which as critics pointed out were too conservative , did not include several million Jews whom it was assumed would be exterminated Having ruled out the idea of solving the Polish problem by liquidating the Poles in the same way as the Jews ' , critics of the Plan merely ' quibbled about such matters as the danger of a revival of Polish nationalism in Siberia , and hence the merits of deporting sixteen to twenty million ' Poles to Brazil and other parts of Latin America . <p> In the case of the far more numerous ethnic Russians , other academic experts  --  such as the Berlin anthropologist Wilhelm Abel , spelled out the technical non-feasibility of mass exterminations , while advocating ways of curbing Russian fertility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , while no steps were to be taken to check infant mortality . With the Russians either deported or reduced to helotry , the next objective was to settle these empty ' spaces with SS veterans , migrants from the Old Reich ' and ethnic German repatriates . Himmler envisaged a series of SS marcher lordships which would gradually be germanised ' . Beyond there would be a series of strong-points ' ringed with soldier-peasant ' settlements , whose conjoined forces could sally forth to crush any signs of unrest among the natives ' . Planning extended to prefabricated cottages ; the layout of instant villages ; and ecologically and militarily sensitive changes to the landscape . Planning continued on the East long after Soviet forces were bearing down on Germany . In July 1944 Himmler was contemplating the merits of stationing Cossacks on the frontier with Russia and the comparative merits of Buddhism and the religion of the Jehovah 's Witnesses , as a means of pacifying ' the Russian population . He envisaged his own future as being the administrator of the Reich ' , ruling from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the retired Fuhrer lived as an artist-cum-seer high above an extensively rebuilt Linz . <p> While SS planners concentrated upon a field they regarded as their own , other agencies were mapping out futures for those Germans who had not been imprisoned , sterilised or murdered as ballast existences ' , " asocials ' or racial aliens ' . Robert Ley 's mammoth German Labour Front apparatus was the socially progressive ' arm of a regime better known for repression and terror . Through its subordinate Beauty of Labour ' and Strength through Joy ' organisations it endeavoured to bring improved conditions , cheap holidays , sport , and a greater sense of worth to the German worker ' , andhence to boost his or her productivity while breaking down traditional class solidarities . Even the exiled SPD leadership was forced to acknowledge the efficacy of these policies , lamenting the petit bourgeois inclinations ' evinced by sections of its erstwhile constituency . <p> During the first years of the war , the DAF 's Scientific Labour Institute made detailed plans for the provision of comprehensive health , insurance and pensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a post-war reward for present deprivation . Interpreting a specific mandate to improve public housing , a field hitherto neglected in favour of monumental building , as a general commission for welfare reform , Ley and his staff made proposals which have some superficial similarities with the Beveridge Report . For example , there was to be a new national pensions scheme whereby the over sixty-fives would receive 60 per cent of their average earnings over the last decade of employment . These plans were augmented with a child benefit scheme and measures to reform health provision . However , closer examination of these schemes reveals that the benefits were contingent upon past achievement ' , and that whole categories of people were excluded from any provision whatsoever on the grounds of race or their asocial ' behaviour . The projected health care reforms , including the provision of public clinics , factory physicians , and affordable spas and sanatoria , also concealed a collectivist and mechanical view of human beings as epitomised in the chilling slogan Your health does not belong to you ' , or in the objective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one services an engine ' . <p> Nazi plans for the future did not amount to anything approximating a coherent vision and paid little regard to what was feasible . They range from the ramblings of Hitler and Himmler to the icy rationality of a small army of technocrats , struggling to fit the insanities of the former into a coherent , logical structure . In this sense , the next generation were more dangerous to humanity than the old fighters ' . Historians continue to argue whether these plans were fundamentally forward or backward lookin reactionary ' or progressive ' , or whether the regime made a contribution , intended or otherwise , to Germany 's march to modernity . These debates should not occlude the larger truth that its core , the regime had neither humanity creative vision , and that the future it offered was founded in empty and erratic petit bourgeois - fantasies . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The new order ?

Racial and Social Policy in the Third Reich for Cambridge University Press . <p>                     @x Ten years ago , I wrote a book that argued for a new vision of Southwestern prehistory : Chaco Meridian : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still believe its premise -- that something I call the Chaco Meridian played an essential role in the life of the ancient Puebloan people -- but it 's due for an update , even if many of my colleagues still are n't completely convinced of the idea . <p> The Chaco Meridian is a north-south line at approximately 108 degrees longitude . Beyond the fact that all longitudes converge at the North Pole , there 's nothing inherently important about 108 degrees . In the American Southwest , however , the line runs through or very near several extremely important sites : Chaco Canyon , Aztec Ruins ( both in New Mexico ) , and Paquim ( just across the border in the Mexican state of Chihuahua ) . Each of these sites , in its time , was by far the biggest and almost certainly most important regional center in the Southwest . The population of each was probably between 2,000 and 3,000 people -- not quite a city , but very large for the Southwest . And they followed one another as major centers in a tight sequence : Chaco from A.D. 850 to 1125 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1250 to 1450 . <p> It occurred to me that the bim-bam-boom sequence of Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim may have had something to do with history . That is , the lockstep series of rises and falls was probably not a matter of chance . Perhaps the collapse of one city somehow set off the rise of the next , with ruling elites moving from the old capital to the new . <p> We already had a pretty good idea that Chaco and Aztec were historically related . Lewis Henry Morgan , the " father of American anthropology , " figured that out in 1878 . The tree-ring dating was precise -- Aztec immediately followed Chaco . Both had " Great Houses , " massive , geometrically exact , multistory buildings that transformed conventional Pueblo architecture into monumental edifices . The ancient Pueblo people left us another compelling clue : the " Great North Road , " a carefully engineered , 30-foot-wide track running 50 miles due north from Chaco Canyon to Aztec Ruins , just a hair east of 108 degrees longitude . My friend and colleague John Stein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many of the linear Chacoan features we called " roads " were , in fact , monuments -- history written on the land -- linking later Great Houses back to earlier ones . Stein called these " roads through time . " The Great North Road was a sacred pathway that connected 11th-century Chaco Canyon to 12th-century Aztec Ruins . <p> Back in the mid-1990s , several of my colleagues and I thought that Chaco was the capital of the 11th-century Pueblo world , and that in the 12th century Chaco 's rulers moved due north and rebuilt their city at Aztec . That sort of thing is not unknown in human history . Early Chinese capitals shifted following the principles of feng shui , the practice of aligning structures to ensure a harmonious flow of energy . <p> But ours was a minority view . Terms like " capital " and " city " and the idea of people deciding where to rebuild a capital on a symbolic whim were not welcome in Southwestern archaeology . Most of us working then were trained to study the Pueblo past not as history , per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sometimes difficult , often changing Southwestern environment . We were trained to treat ancient Pueblo societies like cultures in laboratory petri dishes : sprinkle the right amount of rainfall on the proper soil and up popped pueblos . That approach made a certain amount of sense , of course , because the Southwest is indeed a desert . <p> This emphasis on adaptation and environment led archaeologists to think locally : almost every cultural development was a local adaptation to the immediate environment . In retrospect , I think we overemphasized the desert and undervalued the history -- the political decisions made by rulers ( and , perhaps , challenged by commoners ) that may or may not have made adaptive " sense . " <p> There was far more to the ancient Southwest than a grim struggle for food . Life at Chaco , for example , was not a precarious , hand-to-mouth existence . The Chacoans built a city of magnificent buildings filled with wonderful things ( many from distant lands ) and important people ( perhaps a few from distant lands ) . Scarlet macaws from the Maya jungles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with elaborate seashell jewelry and eye-popping quantities of turquoise from faraway mines . You ca n't do that sort of stuff if you 're wondering where your next meal is coming from . And the city lasted two centuries as the economic , political , and ritual hub of a region the size of Ireland -- definitely bigger than a petri dish . <p> In 1995 , I sat down to write an article , or maybe a book , arguing that our separate petri dishes actually existed in one large terrarium , a single ecosystem in which history -- human political decisions -- was more important than adaptation to the environment . The terrarium was really big : North America . And there was plenty of history south of the border , with Mesoamerican kings and wars and rises and falls . For some : reason , we seldom thought about those kinds of historical events in New Mexico . <p> I thought I could use Chaco and Aztec and the Great North Road as an illustration of large-scale history in the ancient Southwest , so I set out a big map of the region and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come up ( one old theory held that Chaco was actually a colony of Paquim ) , but it was off my map . The latitude and longitude put it -- whoops !  - -  due south of Chaco and Aztec . Hmm . The more I thought about it , the more I thought it might be possible the sites were connected . The old theory that linked Chaco and Paquim was based on good data but bad dating . With new dating , it became clear that Paquim came long after Chaco ( so Chaco could n't have been a Paquim colony ) , but immediately after Aztec . If they could move Chaco to Aztec , why could n't they move Aztec to Paquim ? <p> Well , it is a long , long way . The paltry 50 miles between Chaco and Aztec scared most Southwestern archaeologists -- it was way bigger than our standard petri dish . The distance from Aztec to Paquim is almost 10 times that far ! To me , that was part of its appeal . The whacking great distance from Aztec to Paquim reduced Chaco-to-Aztec to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass up , so I wrote a book , Chaco Meridian , in which I argued that ruling elites from Chaco Canyon first moved north to Aztec Ruins and a century later south to Paquim , reestablishing their capital along 108 degrees longitude , a north-south line that linked the old with the new . <p> The press liked Chaco Meridian because it was novel , it was news . Many of my archaeologist colleagues , however , resented it because the press liked it . But when the academic reviews appeared , they were surprisingly good . I expected my argument to be shredded , but of the dozen reviews I 've seen in journals , from American Anthropologist to Journal of Field Archaeology , only one was negative and it was very polite . ( I told the reviewer -- an old mentor -- that his review was " firm but fair . " ) <p> Of course I took a bit of guff from a few archaeologists who objected to Chaco Meridian 's argument ( fair enough ) . My Paquim proposition in particular was roundly rejected by archaeologists working in Chihuahua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more archaeologists objected to the book 's breezy tone -- much like this article . Not fair , but okay : I was n't writing for them , anyway ; I was writing to subvert their students , tomorrow 's professors . <p> In fact , the move from Chaco to Aztec has come to be accepted by most , but not all , archaeologists . So half of the original argument apparently convinced my colleagues . Far fewer bought my idea that the Chacoan elites eventually moved to Paquim . And there the matter seemed to rest . <p> BUT IN 2004 , a site far to the north , well beyond the points on the old Chaco Meridian , got me hopping-up-and-down excited again . I was driving to the Pecos Conference , a yearly gathering of Southwestern archaeologists , and had time to stop by the Animas-La Plata Project ( ALP ) . Just south of Durango , Colorado , the huge excavation was being done ahead of the construction of a dam and reservoir . Jim Potter , the project director for the cultural resources firm SWCA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the size and complexity of the pit-house sites , which dated to the eighth century A.D. There was nothing in the ALP area immediately before the eighth century , and nothing after . It was a big -- but short-lived -- bang . <p> From the east end of the ALP area to the west end , a distance of some eight miles , there were more eighth-century sites than in any other area in the northern Southwest . It was a continuous blur of houses and villages : not of urban density , but taken together a very large , impressive settlement . In the middle of it all stood Sacred Ridge ( an old local name for the site ) . ALP excavators found things on Sacred Ridge that no one had ever seen at eighth-century sites , such as the 10-foot-wide base of a two-story tower . Nobody built towers in the eighth century ! The ALP complex was clearly the largest cluster of sites of its era , and at its core stood phenomenal architecture . <p> I walked through the ALP sites and wondered where we were exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Chaco Canyon , due north of Aztec Ruins , and due north of Paquim . Well , not precisely due north -- Sacred Ridge is actually a few miles east of Pueblo Bonito , Chaco 's biggest great house . ( As I argue in Chaco Meridian , we should n't expect modern precision from people doing naked-eye engineering with a string and a pole . ) I 'm pretty sure Potter and his colleagues were aware of that fact and , understandably , they do n't want to go there , given Chaco Meridian 's somewhat controversial reputation . But I do . <p> The ALP sites jogged my memory of another , even earlier big site , back at Chaco Canyon . The " Chaco " of Chaco Meridian was the grouping of stone-masonry Great Houses of the 11th and early 12th centuries , like Pueblo Bonito . But there had been strange doings at Chaco Canyon long before those famous photogenic structures . In the sixth and early seventh centuries , Shabik'eschee Village and another unnamed pit-house site ( known as 29 SJ 423 ) flourished in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shallow depressions , each representing an ancient pit house ) , but they were big , indeed the biggest pit-house sites of their times in the Pueblo region . Each had more than 80 houses , and each had a Great Kiva , an underground ceremonial chamber that was a rarity in the sixth century . The next largest sites of that period had about 20 pit houses ( and those are hailed as prodigies ) , and 99 percent of the sites of Shabik'eschee 's time were made up of only one or two houses . <p> Shabik'eschee had been excavated and published in the 1920s . It was a famous anomaly , not a secret or a surprise ( like ALP ) . But between Shabik'eschee 's end in the seventh century and the late-ninth-century beginning of the Great Houses , Chaco Canyon was abandoned . This had always been an obstacle to linking Chaco 's earlier and later big sites . <p> Perhaps the newly excavated ALP sites filled that gap . In Chaco Meridian , I wrote that the center shifted , first north and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement reached even farther back in time . Each Pueblo era , from A.D. 500 to 1275 , had a single , central , large , complicated site , and each was on or very near the Meridian : Shabik'eschee/423 in the sixth and seventh centuries ; Sacred Ridge and the ALP complex in the eighth century , followed by the succession of Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim . All these sites were located from 107 degrees 50 feet longitude to 108 degrees -- an east-west wobble of only a few miles on a line of 475 miles , from Sacred Ridge on the north to Paquim on the south . <p> Shabik'eschee , Sacred Ridge , Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim -- five unique points in a line , each the biggest and most important site of its respective era . The chances of that happening by accident are miniscule . There has to be history -- human decisions and human intentions -- behind the Meridian . <p> SO , FOR SEVEN CENTURIES , the center of the Pueblo world bounced back and forth over ( only ) 80 miles , from Chaco Canyon to Sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern extension to Paquim is still a matter of doubt and debate , I admit . But the new data from Shabik'eschee and the ALP complex give me some confidence that the Chaco Meridian was real , and that it meant something to ancient Pueblo people . <p> What exactly did it mean ? I do n't know -- yet . To understand the Meridian , we need context . None of these sites sat alone in the Southwest . There were thousands of smaller Pueblo sites in every time period , and each period had its own complicated history and geography . Beyond the Pueblo region , there was the remarkable Hohokam civilization in southern Arizona , and of course there were Mesoamerican cultures far to the south . We will never understand Shabik'eschee , Sacred Ridge , Chaco , Aztec , and Paquim without looking far beyond the sites themselves and beyond the Southwest -- think about the whole terrarium , not just the petri dish . <p> MAP : COLORADO , NEW MEXICO , MEXICO <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : University of Colorado archaeologist Stephen H.
