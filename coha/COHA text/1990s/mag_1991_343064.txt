If this issue of TIME seems vaguely familiar , it may be because you watched us putting it together on television last week . From early Monday afternoon through late Friday evening , an 18-member crew from C-SPAN , the cable television industry 's public affairs network , followed our staff as we assembled our analysis of the week 's news . C-SPAN , which is available in 53 million U.S. homes , aired a total of 25 hours of live coverage of our editorial meetings as well as taped interviews with editors ; art , picture and production staff ; and some of my publishing colleagues . Our video friends were even hosts of call-in programs that allowed viewers to discuss issues with TIME journalists . <P> " We wanted to take an in-depth and real-time look at the largest news weekly magazine in the U.S. , " says Brian Lamb , the founder and chief executive officer of C-SPAN . " I really do believe that if someone watches only television to get his information , he 's making a big mistake . You need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . " <P> Lamb , a fellow Hoosier from Lafayette , Ind. , conducted many of the interviews himself . His crew commandeered a small conference room on our 24th floor . " I was surprised at how quickly everybody adapted to the situation , " says Barrett Seaman , deputy chief of correspondents . " Everything went much more smoothly than I expected . " <P> Although TIME staff members appear on television with increasing frequency , this was the first time that our planning meetings had been broadcast live . Some of us noticed an unusual number of fresh coiffures and telegenic neckties , but , generally , what the viewers saw was remarkably close to the routine atmosphere of a normal work-week . Early in the week our journalists were probably all a little uptight , unwilling to risk spilling a favorite story idea or sounding less than omniscient . A few of our key decisions had to take place off-camera , but by the end of the week many staff members were becoming quite casual . Without waiting for the reviews , I think our debut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball game but noticeably better than a bad day 's debate in the Congress . And I am proud of our staff : no one said " Hi , Mom ! " all week .
