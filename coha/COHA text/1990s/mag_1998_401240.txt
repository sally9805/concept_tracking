Your guide to pairing vegetarian food with wine . // It 's Friday night and after a long , hectic work week , you finally have some time to relax . What better way to begin the weekend than with a casual dinner , dictated by your own pace for a change . This is a perfect opportunity to try that bottle of cabernet franc you received as a gift . Now you only need to make one more " key " decision before your decompression can begin in earnest : choosing a meal to enhance the wine and bring out its best characteristics . Selecting food to complement wine ? If this seems backward , it 's because it once was-but not any longer . The recent proliferation of wines made from a vast array of grape types ( varietals ) has meant that people have begun taking a keen interest in experiencing the differences and subtle characteristics among them . This desire has evolved into the seemingly unconventional way of planning a meal-starting with the wine and then shaping a menu to complement it . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will pair up best with that wine you ca n't wait to taste . Of course , these tips work just as well if you prefer to choose your menu first and then a wine to match it . THE FLAVOR OF WINE The quality and character of a wine is dependent upon a number of considerations . Each grape varietal ( for example merlot , Sangiovese , chardonnay ) has its own basic flavor . However , that flavor is altered by the climate and the soil of the place the grapes are grown , as well as the quality and age of the vines and the style of the winemaker . As a result , wines produced in a single location will vary from vintage to vintage . Furthermore , wine made in one place will vary from wine made in another even though both are derived from the same type of grape . To evaluate a wine 's flavor , you first need to familiarize yourself with the essential taste of each varietal ( see Tasting the Classics , p. 28 ) . This is surprisingly easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can identify the differences between varietals , and how straightforward and , indeed , predictable these differences really are . Simply reserve a few seconds to think about the wines you sample and the adjectives you would choose to describe their flavor ( see Wine Words , p. 29 ) . WINE 'S FIVE COMPONENTS Learn to evaluate wine by its basic components-body , acidity , tannin , fruit and sweetness-and how each can influence food pairings . Again , you 'll find this to be an easy and entertaining thing to do , and far less intimidating than many in the wine business would have you believe . The body of the wine is the first thing to consider when choosing a complementary food . The framework for measuring this characteristic is straightforward and actually quite logical : A wine can be either full-bodied , medium-bodied or light-bodied . In general , a full-bodied wine will overpower a delicately flavored dish . The opposite is also true , with robustly flavored fare tending to mask the nuances of a light-bodied wine . Photograph // For example , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish which emphasizes soy sauce , sesame oil , black bean paste and rice wine is a perfect match . Or you could pair a lightbodied champagne with a more delicate vegetable stir-fry . Acidity is also a critical element of wine and is essential for balancing the different characteristics of a given varietal . Knowing the relative acidity of a wine is important for matching a dish to it . Sauces made from fruits , highly acidic vegetables , vinegar and even wine itself will make a wine with low acidity taste dull and flat . Southern Italian pasta dishes with red sauces pair well with zinfandel , Sangiovese or Barbera wines , all of which have good acidity . A richer pasta dish made with cream and cheese will complement a fresh , aggressively acidic wine such as a young chardonnay . In effect , the sharpness , or acidity , of the wine acts to " cut through " the richness of the dish making for a balanced taste experience . How tannic a wine is should also dictate your choice of food . Tannin is found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any great degree in red wines . It 's impact is described as an astringent quality . The degree of astringency varies considerably with the type of grape used because some grape skins have more tannin than others . For example , the Nebbiollo and cabernet sauvignon grape skins typically contain more tannin than the merlot skins , and therefore have a Wines that are highly tannic can be off-putting when sipped on their own , but both it and the food can taste wonderful . ( Try a sip of wine before you start the meal , and one with the food , and experience this phenomenon for yourself . ) Tannic wines , however , will overwhelm delicate dishes . So pair a tannic cabernet sauvignon with a robust wild mushroom risotto , and a less tannic pinot noir when serving a light minestrone soup . The term fruit is often used to describe the extent of the grape taste in the wine . Generally , the younger the wine , the fruitier it is . Wines that have matured for several years have a notably subdued fruitiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Beaujolais ) than heavier ones ( cabernet sauvignon ) . Dishes containing fruit in their sauces , such as orange or cherry , go best with fruity wines . Entrees that make use of honey , sweet cider or sweet wine are also excellent complements for a fruity wine , while a mature , less fruity wine will taste quite dull with dishes of this type . Photograph // Tasting the Classics // Wine Words // Many people are partial to sweet wines . Sweetness is expressed by the amount of residual sugar the wine contains : the amount of sugar contained in the grape that is not converted to alcohol during the fermentation process . The higher the residual sugar , the sweeter the wine will taste . For the menu planner , sweet wines present a challenge as well as an opportunity . Choosing a dish sweeter than the wine will tend to dull the flavor and character of the wine . A sweet wine will have the same effect on a less sweet dish . Therefore , dishes with a degree of sweetness that matches that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course exist , and sometimes a dish that presents a significant contrast to the sweetness of a wine can work very nicely . For example , a dish with a salty , tangy or even spicy flavor can go surprisingly well with a sweet wine . Many Asian dishes would qualify here . After narrowing the field of food choices to complement a favorite wine , it 's time to fine tune your selection by returning to the first characteristic we discussed , flavor . The flavors of wine are usually described in terms of their similarities to one or more fruits , vegetables , herbs and even flowers . You have probably seen wine reviews that refer to a specific wine as exhibiting the essence of " black currants , " " gooseberries , " " pepper , " " nuts " or even " rose petals . " At first , these comparisons may seem odd , but there 's something to them . Matching the flavors of a dish as closely as possible to the flavors of a wine will create a symbiotic relationship between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word of caution : certain foods , no matter how good they taste , simply do not go well with wine . Experience suggests that the two most " wine unfriendly " foods are artichokes and asparagus . Chemists have isolated a component in these vegetables that makes wine taste metallic . Over time , you may find that other foods are wine unfriendly as well , even if others disagree with you . That 's fine , because there is no right and wrong when it comes to pairing- in the final analysis , it 's only your taste buds that count . These are the basics for selecting the right menu for your favorite wine and vice versa . Now , with only a little practice and a few moments of consideration , you 'll be able to forge delicious wine and food partnerships-and in this burdensome world , these may prove to be some of life 's most uplifting pleasures .
