// What is the most frequent illness in the U.S. , occurring 100 million times per year ? What accounts for 30 million lost workdays , 30 million lost school days , and 32 million visits to the doctor each year ? The answer to each question is the common cold . According to the recent pharmacy newsletter , " The Rx Consultant , " it is estimated that 75 percent of individuals with colds self-treat with over-the-counter drugs which include antihistamines , decongestants , cough medicines , expectorants , painkillers and a staggering assortment of combination products . There are over 800 drug store remedies with a collective list of side effects which includes : increased pulse rate , palpitations , dizziness , increased blood pressure , nervousness , irritability , insomnia , drowsiness , dry mouth , urinary retention , blurred vision , stomach upset , nausea , lightheadedness and constipation . There is even evidence to suggest that a couple of these synthetic ingredients actually suppress the antibody response , increase the duration of nasal symptoms and prolong viral shedding . A cold is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms typically include a runny or congested nose , sneezing , cough and sore throat . Colds are generally self-limiting in healthy individuals and last about a week or less . If one 's immune system is not up to par , colds can last longer or result in complications like sinus infections , earaches , bronchitis and pneumonia , although the latter two are more commonly associated with the flu . The common complaints that generally differentiate cold and flu symptoms are fever and aches and pains ( usually with flu ) . We are often asked to share what we do when we get a cold or the flu . Our response is that we rarely get colds and flu because of preventative measures . Our vitamin program is very high in immune system nutrients and we take an ancient Chinese herbal resistance building blend which contains astragalus , ganoderma mushroom , schizandra , ginger and more . However , for the rare occasions we do need help , we rely on a variety of natural products . Our arsenal of natural warriors includes the homeopathic medicines , echinacea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as zinc and elderberry lozenges . Even though the flu is caused by a completely different set of viruses , our protocol changes mainly in the zinc and elderberry lozenges and the homeopathic remedy with which we quell the symptoms . HOMEOPATHIES If ever there were a therapy that fits the first law of medicine , " first do no harm , " it would be homeopathy . Homeopathic medicine is a 200-year-old natural system that is based on the practice of treating like with like , where symptoms are treated with minute quantities of natural substances that would normally bring on those same symptoms if taken in significantly larger quantities . It is generally regarded as safe , has no unwanted side effects , is effective , non addictive , and can be used by children , the elderly and even babies . Some of the many remedies that are recommended for colds and flu are : HEDERA HELIX ( ENGLISH IVY ) The effects of hedera helix are widespread and especially for symptoms of the mucous membranes . It is one of the most successful remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinuses , congestion and pharyngitis . LUFFA OPERCULATA ( SPONGE CUCUMBER ) Luffa 's effect extends to the mucous membranes of the nose , the throat , and the paranasal sinuses . Luffa elicits excellent results in cases of head colds , as well as allergies , with a tendency to either a runny or stuffy nose . Additionally , fatigue associated with colds and headaches are favorably affected . PULSATILLA ( WIND FLOWER ) Pulsatilla extract has a marked effect on all mucous membranes . This leads to its homeopathic use in cases of acute colds , acute or chronic congestion , laryngitis and bronchitis . EUPATORIUM PERFOLIATUM ( BONESET ) In addition to being good for runny nose and dry cough , Eupatorium also relieves headache and overall body aches and pains . BRYONIA ALBA ( WILD HOPS ) Bryonia is especially effective for body aches worsened by movement . It is beneficial for nose , throat and bronchial involvement , as well as headache . GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS ( YELLOW JASMINE ) Gelsemium is a remedy which keys in on weakness and heavy limbs associated with flu symptoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been used extensively for fever and flu symptoms including headache , sore neck and shoulder muscles . Homeopathic medicine is used worldwide , and to avoid confusion , medicines are referred to by their Latin binomials . The good news is that many of these ingredients are available in user-friendly combinations . Three ethical companies who make consistently effective products are Boericke St Tafel ( America 's oldest homeopathic company ) , Homeophyters ( a line of products sold exclusively at Great Earth Vitamin Stores ) , and Dolisos America ( a French company that is one of the world 's largest homeopathic manufacturers ) . Their products are called Alpha CF , Homeophyter Cold , Cough or Influenza , and Cold and Flu Energy Medicine , respectively . GOLDENSEAL Goldenseal is a potent botanical with a rich history of use among Native Americans , particularly those of the Cherokee tribe . Goldenseal 's potent properties are primarily due to the alkaloids berberine , hydrastine and canadine . These phytonutrient alkaloids produce a strong astringent effect on mucous membranes , reduce inflammation and have antiseptic effects . One of goldenseal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrastine was entered in the United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) from 1905-1926 , and was classified as an hemostatic ( an agent that stops hemorrhage ) . Recent research has corroborated this and other biological activities . Goldenseal possesses cytotoxic activity which indicates that it is useful against viruses . Its antibacterial properties have been well-established since 1950 , especially against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus . Berberine , another of goldenseal 's alkaloids , was found to have anti-convulsive effects on the intestines and uterus . Note : Goldenseal should not be taken in too large a dose or for too long a period of time due to its capacity to overstimulate the nervous system and because its alkaloids are eliminated slowly from the body . ECHINACEA Centuries ago Native Americans collected the root of the purple coneflower , echinacea . Several species of echinacea were collected and cherished by at least 14 tribes . This herb was a favorite folk medicine wherever it grew . Currently echinacea has been the subject of more than 350 scientific studies . In laboratory testing echinacea increases the immune defense systems function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are echinacosides and essential oils . GENERAL DEFENSE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT Echinacea increases the total number of defense system cells and developing cells within the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue , and speeds their development into immuno-competent cells . It speeds their release into circulation so more are present in the blood and lymph , and it increases their activity . In other words it causes cells responsible for engulfing and destroying invading organisms to do so more quickly . Echinacea also helps increase the reaction of body processes involved in the production of chemicals in the defense system , like interferon and interlukins . SPECIFIC RESEARCH In 1972 echinacea was shown to possess significant anti-tumor activity in experiments with rats . Antiviral activity was reported in 1978 showing that echinacea was effective in destroying herpes and influenza viruses . Work in 1956 demonstrated the powerful antibacterial properties of echinacea . European laboratories have reported the activation of human lymphocytes and the increased rate of phagocytosis and macrophage activation by echinacea . Recent research has confirmed that echinacea also inhibits an enzyme called hyaluronidase , which bacteria use to ride into body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stimulating new tissue formation . For convenience most people prefer to use a standardized combination of echinacea and goldenseal in tablet form . ELDERBERRY It was not until the mid-1980s that the active ingredients in elderberry , which were effective in treating influenza viruses , were discovered . Dr. Jean Lindenman , the developer of interferon , first suggested the potential of the elderberry as a research project due to its long folk history . With medicinal plants increasingly under the scrutiny of modern scientists , laboratory work was first begun by isolating active principles of proteins derived from the elderberry plant . Tests were performed against various strains of influenza and it was found that two of the active ingredients effectively combated the virus . Viruses can not replicate themselves on their own . They must invade living cells and alter their function . If one can stop the virus from entering the cell , one has defeated the disease . The flu virus invades cells by puncturing their walls with tiny spikes , called hemagglutinin , that cover its surface . The active ingredients in elderberry actually disarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from piercing the cell membrane . The viral spikes are covered with an enzyme called neuraminidase , which acts to break down the cell wall . Bioflavonoids , also present in high concentration in elderberries , may inhibit the action of this enzyme . In 1992 a team of Israeli scientists and physicians formulated a product containing the active elderberry ingredients combined with other natural components . The Helsinki Committee , a worldwide organization which approves patient studies , approved a clinical trial and a double-blind study which was carried out on patients infected with the flu virus during an epidemic in southern Israel . Within 24 hours the symptoms , fever , cough and muscle pain had significantly improved in 20 percent of the patients . After the second day another 75 percent were clearly much improved , and in three days a complete cure was achieved in over 90 percent of the patients studied . Among the control group only eight percent of patients showed an improvement after 24 hours , and for the remaining 92 percent , improvement was observed within six days or more . Tests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies . It was found that the level of antibodies was higher in patients receiving the elderberry extract versus those receiving the placebo , indicating an enhanced defense response in those patients . NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS VITAMIN C Vitamin C is necessary as an antioxidant nutrient . It is essential for wound-healing and affects immune responses . Research conducted by the late Dr. Linus Pauling and other researchers suggests that vitamin C may also help prevent a cold and/or reduce the length of the cold . VITAMIN A Vitamin A is necessary for the health of mucous membranes . These membranes are highly irritated in individuals with a cold . Vitamin A is also necessary for the health of the thymus gland . It is the function of the thymus to produce certain immune system chemicals that fight against illnesses such as the cold and flu viruses . BEE PROPOLIS Propolis is a resinous substance collected from various plants by bees . It is used in the construction of and to seal the cracks in the bee hive . Due to its antibacterial/antiviral properties it prevents microorganisms from invading the hive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey-bee 's antibiotic . " Bee propolis may provide important nutritional support to individuals suffering from the common cold or flu . ZINC Double-blind research has indicated that when zinc was given to human subjects in a lozenge form prior to exposure to the cold virus , they were less likely to become ill . Furthermore individuals who already had a cold and were given zinc lozenges experienced a reduction in the length and severity of their cold symptoms . In one particular study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic , 100 employees who signed up within 24 hours after developing cold symptoms were given lozenges to be taken every two hours while awake for the duration of their illness . The patients assigned to zinc experienced significantly shorter colds , with reductions in the time to complete resolution of symptoms ( 4.4 versus 7.6 days ) , and the number of days with each of the following symptoms : cough , headache , hoarseness , nasal congestion , runny nose and sore throat . A COLD AND FLU REGIMEN The following regimen is not intended to take the place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an example of how we might manage our own health if the need presented itself . Dry Vitamin A-A one-time only loading dose of 200,000 international units ( IU ) . This seems like a lot but we are advocating one dose only per cold episode . Esterified and Buffered Vitamin C-2000 mg ( four capsules of 500 mg each ) every two hours for two days , then three times daily for five days . If this is not the exact formulation of vitamin C one has at home , do not follow these instructions ; it may cause an adverse reaction . Echinacea-Using a good standardized echinacea/goldenseal tablet , two tablets three times daily for two days , then one tablet three times daily thereafter for at least seven to 10 days . Bee Propolis-Five tablets three times daily for four days . Zinc lozenges-Two zinc lozenges , dissolved slowly in the mouth ( one after the other ) . Thereafter one lozenge every two hours while awake ; repeat for four days . Elderberry lozenges-One lozenge four times daily for four days . Homeopathies-Match medicines to symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side effects . Anyone , including little children , can use them regardless of other medications one may be required to take . Use Cold Remedy for stuffiness , runny nose , hoarseness , phlegm , etc. ; use Cough Remedy for cough . CONCLUSION Remember that colds and flu are caused by viruses , not bacteria , and that means that prescription antibiotics will not affect them . Before accepting antibiotics ask the physician why he is prescribing them and make sure s/he has a good reason . Make sure s/he is not simply contributing to the growing resistant-bacterial strain problem . On the other hand consider contacting a physician if . the patient is a child less than two years of age , a persistent headache or a rash is present , a fever is very high for more than 24 hours , harsh symptoms persist for more than two weeks or a child 's cough lasts more than 10 days . These symptoms may indicate a more serious condition requiring medical attention . + // <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
