<p> Babies singing doo-wop is the latest gimmick ad agency BBDO 's Michael Patti came up with to sell Doritos chips . Despite the hassles of casting 45 infants who , by law , can only work 20 minutes a day , and dealing with pushy stage parents trying to angle their little sweethearts in , Patti knows it was well worth it . <p> Whenever that ad airs , every parent in earshot of a TV is going to pay attention : It opens with crying infants . <p> " In the first five seconds of this spot , I know there is n't a parent out there who does n't go on immediate alert at the sound of these babies crying , " says Patti , BBDO 's executive creative director . " We 're here to put a smile on the consumer 's face . But we 're here to get their attention , too . " <p> Thanks to a demographics trend that is being called " Invasion of the stroller people , " babies are hot , both as consumers and marketing tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the U.S. marketplace every year . The last time annual births topped 4 million was 1964 , the end of the 18-year baby boom . <p> The U.S. population under age 5 is 23.6 million , up 20% from 1980 . Many baby boomers are getting around to having kids , and many are two-income couples with lots of disposable cash . They join twentysomethings having their first babies . That makes babies one of the most lucrative niche markets of the decade . <p> Greeting newborns are countless new products and marketing campaigns from companies that never really considered babies a marketing tool - or a viable market . <p> The Gap was an early retail leader with GapKids , now 354-stores strong . GapKids began in 1986 , launching babyGap departments in GapKids stores in 1990 . GapKids now accounts for an estimated 16% of Gap 's annual earnings . " Gap reinvented the baby and kids market , " says Philip Abbenhaus , retail analyst for Stifel , Nicolaus . " They brought mainstream adult fashion to the infant and toddler set . " The strategy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes more often than adults . " If dressing the babies helps them sell bigger sizes down the road , so much the better , " he says . <p> Others hope to follow Gap 's strategy . Shopping mall space devoted to children 's clothing is up 15% from last year , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers . Retail sales of baby products total $ 28 billion a year . Aside from medical costs , new parents typically spend $ 7,000 in a baby 's first year on everything from diapers to day care , says Larry Hawks , child marketing expert and president of Marketing Communications . Even marketers who have nothing to do with babies are using them in their ad campaigns , if only to grab the attention of new parents and grandparents . <p> By targeting the infant market , retailers and manufacturers hope to create a lifelong customer of the baby and his or her family . " This is a fast-growing market with enormous appeal for companies who may not have considered it before , " says Cynthia Cohen Turk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month 's National Retail Federation 's panel discussion , The Baby Craze . " The opportunity for a loyal , lifetime customer is huge . " <p> Among the latest forays in the baby biz : <p>  --  Nike . The athletic shoe giant will expand into the baby clothing market for the first time this fall . A licensed line of toddler sportswear will hit stores in time for the holiday shopping season , joining Nike 's already-popular Air Jordan shoes for babies . " Parents today like to dress their kids in items they themselves like , " says Bruce Krebs , president of H.H. Cutler , Nike 's licensed-clothing manufacturer . <p>  --  Talbots . After successfully launching a children 's clothing line in 1990 , Talbots will introduce Talbots Babies Aug. 18 . The women 's clothing chain is best known for its conservative country club look favored by shoppers such as former first lady Barbara Bush . " We can take the classic taste our customers expect into this market , " says Talbots spokeswoman Kathy Staab . <p>  --  Baby Superstore . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The operator of 50 giant stores stocks everything from cribs to bibs for the infant-to-preschooler crowd . There 's room for 500 Baby Superstores in the USA alone , industry analysts say . " The target market is new parents who have little desire to go from store to store looking for everything they need , " says retail analyst Rick Nelson , of Duff and Phelps . The stock , which closed Friday at $ 33 1/2 , down 2 , has soared since the company initially offered shares to the public last fall . <p>  --  Fisher-Price . The toymaker is taking its brand name to the clothing aisles this year with apparel for babies and toddlers , made by Healthtex . " Brands are always in demand , especially in the children 's market where the buyer wants to feel confident in the label , " says Gary Simmons , president of Healthtex . The Fisher-Price line takes a cue from GapKids , designing and marketing its clothing in full outfits , from hats to socks . <p> Babies have inspired the marketing community , too . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby actors in their latest commercials . They hope to follow in the tradition of baby-happy Michelin Tires . Michelin 's campaign " Because so much is riding on your tires " celebrates its 10th birthday this year . <p> The 4 million babies born each year are n't the only force driving the market . The changing demographics of their parents are a very important factor too . <p> " More babies are great , but the most important thing we are seeing is more dollars out there to be spent on babies , " says Simmons . Today 's new parents have more money to spend on babies because they tend to be older . In 1980 , the largest percentage of new mothers were ages 20 to 24 . Ten years later , as this latest baby boom began , the biggest group of new moms were ages 25 to 29 . Many women are putting off pregnancy even longer . In 1970 , only 11.5% of mothers were ages 30 to 34 ; in 1990 , 21.3% were in that age group . <p> " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are just out of college . None of you have a lot to spend , " says Turk . " If you are 37 , and your friends range from 36 to 42 , you are all making more money and your ability to spend it on gifts is greatly increased . " <p> And then there are the grandparents - famous for dropping big bucks on babies . There are 68 million people 50 older in the USA . That 's expected to jump to 76 million the next five years . In 1996 , the first of the baby boomers turns 50 . As that mass market heads toward grandparent status , retailers are also looking to capture them as consumers , Turk says . " When you see an adult brand scaled down to baby sizes , such as a Ralph Lauren , that 's a product aimed at the grandparents , " she says . <p> Meanwhile , the new baby boom is sustaining the baby business in ways other niche businesses only dream about . The pregnancy book What to Expect When You 're Expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title is 10 years old . Joining it as top sellers are sequels , What to Eat When You 're Expecting and What to Expect in the Toddler Years . Toddler , on shelves just a few months , has sold 325,000 copies . <p> " We never expected this to go on and on , " says Andrea Eisenberg , one of the series ' three co-authors . " But the way things are going , it looks like we wo n't be doing anything else . The demand for information keeps growing . " <p> Hawks , of Marketing Communications , predicts this is just the start of a retail/marketing baby craze . Childhood does n't last long , but as the older customers graduate from baby status , 300,000 new babies arrive each month . " It 's the niche market that keeps on giving , " Hawks says . <p> Baby , we mean business The number of births has been slowing , but is still close to the baby boom years . ( millions of births ) <p> Peak baby boom years ... <p> ' 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 59 4.3 ' 60 4.3 ' 61 4.3 ' 62 4.2 <p> ... the latest baby boomlet <p> ' 88 3.9 ' 89 4.0 ' 90 4.2 ' 91 4.1 ' 92 4.1 ' 93 4.0 ' 94 4.1 ' 95 4.0
