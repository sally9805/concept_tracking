<p> It 's 1:15 on a Tuesday afternoon and Charles D. Gandy is flying through the Atlanta Decorative Arts Center ( ADAC ) , shaking hands , joking with showroom owners and trading repartee with friends . <p> " Oooooh , I like that , " he says to Gayle Freeauf of Designer Carpets . <p> Ms. Freeauf : " I know you , Charles . Steely , elephant colors ; no fuzzy , no pile . " <p> He calls himself a politician . Did he miss his calling ? Not a chance . <p> The 44-year-old interior designer , nationally known for his elegant contemporary design , is president of the Buckhead interior design firm Gandy/Peace Inc. , and a past national president of the American Society of Interior Designers ( 1988 ) , an achievement noteworthy for its precocity . Then 37 , he was the youngest person ever elected to the post . <p> But this year Mr. Gandy is really on a roll . Named 1993 Southeastern Designer of the Year by ADAC ( an honor he also garnered in 1989 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national American Society of Interior Designers ( ASID ) award for residential design over 3,500 square feet - the second time they have claimed their field 's equivalent of an Oscar - and they recently walked off with three of the top four residential design awards from the Georgia chapter of ASID . <p> On this day , Mr. Gandy is selecting accessories for three different design projects . At a given time , Gandy/Peace Inc. may have as many as 20 clients - primarily upscale homeowners . <p> He zips into an accessories showroom , cases the place and zeroes in on a set of eight creamy-colored decorative orbs the size of golf balls . He checks the price . " Good God - $ 2,000 for the set ? We do n't need them . " <p> Mindful of his clients ' budgets , no matter how grand - his projects range from a 20,000-square-foot North Carolina mansion to a series of corporate showrooms and even a vacation home in Guatemala - he readily admits he 's not cheap . " I ca n't afford me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how he explains his design philosophy . " Have one color , beige , but have 15 shades of beige . The result at first looks simple , but after looking at it awhile , you realize there are 15 textures of beige and it 's all quite complex . " <p> Beyond interior design , he also is a skilled fiber artist . ( He once made a living at it ; today he 's content to needlepoint fish based on puns - one called " Holy Mackerel " has holes in it . ) <p> Moreover , he has written two books , has lectured on design from Japan to Madagascar , and cooks . <p> " He 's so multitalented and so nice , " says Sian Imber , an executive of Merchandise Mart Chicago and Washington Design Center . " If you did n't adore Charles , you 'd hate him . " <p> Not that Mr. Gandy 's a saint . <p> " It did take him six years to return some books he borrowed , " Ms. Freeauf says . " But you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers . " <p> So who is Charles D. Gandy , beyond his 14-page resume ? <p> He 'd make a lousy politician - no guile . With Mr. Gandy , what you see is what you get . He 's an iconoclast , a creative type not given to high drama or hubris . <p> What he is given to is enthusiasm . " He gets so excited , so anxious to discuss things with clients , he 'll show his entire deck . Whereas I 'm like , let 's wait 30 minutes , then show it to them , " says Mr. Peace . <p> He 's also known as an adaptable , consensus-seeking designer . " I 've been in presentations with him where we 've had just a beautiful , beautiful design scheme but for some emotional reason , the clients did n't latch on to it , " says Atlanta architect Rusty Barber . " Well , he just turns around and comes up with another beautiful , beautiful design scheme . " <p> This attribute , combined with flat-out talent , goes a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is decor . <p> " When we were ready to do our home , we asked friends to recommend designers , " says Sue Williams , wife of Portman Co. executive vice president Sam Williams . " The one name that showed up on everyone 's list was Charles Gandy . " <p> The reason is simple , says Howard Shaw , who with wife Jan hired Gandy/Peace , Inc. to do the interiors of their new Buckhead home . " What I wanted is a quiet elegance inside the house . . . they achieved it . " <p> This kind of stunning subtlety is not unique , says Karen Irons , editor of Southern Accents . " But it 's especially nice coming from the South . " <p> Moreover , his playful , imaginative spirit is infectious . Notes ASID executive director Bob Angle , " Charles 's philosophy is ' let 's do it , let 's do it together , and let 's make it fun . ' <p> " We decided that if our professional pressures get too great , we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work out front and he 's going to work inside . That 's our dropout scenario . " <p> With the exception of his mother 's death when he was 19 , Mr. Gandy says fate has been kind to him . " My toughest time since was adjusting to being just a regular guy after being ASID president , " he says . " But I made it . " <p> He grew up the oldest of four brothers in Birmingham , Ala. , in a house that overlooked a school . His first memory " was being 4 or 5 , watching the children and wanting so much to go . " <p> And when he did , " I was a Mr. Goody Two-Shoes - never missed a day , never late , got straight A 's . My parents were very supportive people . They never told me ' no , ' " says Mr. Gandy while sitting on the screened porch of the retreat he shares with a friend on Lake Burton in Clayton County . ( His Atlanta digs - a Midtown triplex he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) <p> After graduating from Auburn University in 1971 , he worked for two Atlanta interior design companies , and in 1979 opened his own firm . <p> He hired Mr. Peace to manage his firm in 1983 when he first ran for the ASID presidency because " many designers go bankrupt doing this . " He lost the election but says , " It gave Bill and me time to get to know each other . " <p> They clicked , becoming partners in 1985 . Three years later , he ran again for ASID president - and won . <p> From the get-go , President Gandy was a healer and mediator , according to Mr. Angle , who states that even today , " He 's the kind of consultant you go to the mountain and say , ' Give me the words of wisdom . ' " <p> This gift is a mixed blessing for Mr. Gandy . He has n't achieved guru status yet , but even friends sense his growing stature and pull back for fear of imposing too much on his time and generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend Judy Barber , director of the Hambidge Center in North Georgia . " Near Lake Burton there 's a man who sells cut flowers from his own garden . He did n't have a sign . Charles had one made and just took it to him as a gift . That 's Charles . He 'll go out of his way to do something for a friend , even a stranger . " <p> Still , a busy life and impending guruship do have a downside . <p> " Sometimes I feel like the prom queen who does n't have a date on Saturday night , " he says . " Everyone just assumes I 'm busy . But often I 'm not . " <p> On weekends he revels at his lake house , plays piano ( a rediscovered pleasure from childhood ) , and dreams about the line of design products he and Mr. Peace hope to produce someday ( Mr. Gandy tested the waters with samples of a " Picket Fence " furniture line this year ) . Or , as now , he just sits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " Do you want to see the big lake ? " <p> On the walk down to Lake Burton he is asked , is 1993 his year ? <p> " Oh , I think every year is our year . And I could n't do it without them . They make me look good , " he demurs , referring to the Gandy/Peace Inc. team : Mr. Peace , interior designers Margie Kelly and Agnes Moscrip , and office manager Pat Ketchum . <p> Pointing to a neighbor 's day lilies , he says , " Are n't they pretty ? " He walks over to take a closer peek . Looking up , grinning , he says , " I have a nice life , do n't I ? " <p> He looks toward the lake and murmurs , " 1993 , huh ? Well , maybe . "
