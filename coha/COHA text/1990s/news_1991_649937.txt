<p> Sunday the Super Bowl will be played in Tampa and so , inevitably , my thoughts turn to abortion . <p> If that seems like a preposterous connection , it is only because you have not seen " Champions for Life , " the video featuring scenes from the New York Giants ' last Super Bowl victory and six members of that championship team talking about their blocking , their passing and their opposition to legal abortion . It 's a bizarre juxtaposition that might be reminiscent of " Saturday Night Live " if it were n't so offensive . <p> " The skies were sunny , the temperature a comfortable 76 degrees , " says the narrator , as we-came-to-play music is heard in the background . Fans wave pompons . Players take to the field . The narrator adds , " What follows are a few highlights from that game and some comments from the champions . " <p> Mark Bavaro catches a pass , then appears in street clothes to say : " At the end of the game all the Giants players left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to run rampant through our country , I wonder how many future champions will be killed before they see the light of day . " <p> George Martin sacks John Elway in the end zone . His thoughts ? " I 'm glad I was able to help turn the tide in the Super Bowl with that safety . I hope and pray that the Supreme Court has begun to turn the tide against the legalized destruction of babies allowed by the Roe v. Wade decision . That infamous decision said that unborn babies have no rights just as the shameful Dred Scott decision said that black people have no rights . " <p> And Phil Simms , musing on his record-breaking day : " When I woke up the next morning and read those statistics in the paper , I was very pleased and proud . But there was another statistic in the paper that morning that did n't get the same coverage the Super Bowl got . I guess they thought it was n't very important . It was just a little item that stated there are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I 've left out Phil McConkey , Chris Godfrey and Jim Burt . They 've left out women ; the word is not used once during the 10-minute film . But you get the idea . Abortion and football  --  you just ca n't separate them . The video ends with the question , " If the abortionists had their way , which two of these Giants might never have had the chance to be champions ? " <p> It had never occurred to me that this was a central issue in the debate over reproductive freedom . <p> Wellington Mara , an owner of the team , was the guiding spirit behind " Champions for Life . " He is one of its producers and says he was largely responsible for financing it . The American Life League , an anti-abortion group based in Virginia which distributes the video , has sent it to hundreds of organizations . Their records show that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles alone bought almost 300 copies , some to be shown in schools to kids who may think the words " quarterback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who appear volunteered . <p> That 's no surprise . We 've become accustomed to movie actors and bass guitarists who believe that notoriety has given them a flair for geopolitics . But whether or not a pregnant woman should be allowed to end a pregnancy is a serious , complicated subject . Using football wrapped around self-righteous bromides to sell opposition to legal abortion is a little like using sex to sell cigarettes . It 's permissible . And it 's unseemly . Like the moment in the video when Jim Burt holds his young son on his shoulders and the kid says , in a way I assume is meant to sound unscripted , " It 's great to be alive . " <p> There are surely fans , men and women seen cheering wildly on that tape , who would be appalled to discover that they are part of such an effort . Deborah Kent , a hypnotherapist who was once such a megafan that she was profiled in the sports pages of this paper and who was sent a copy of the video after complaining to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Mark Bavaro I hope he drops the ball . " <p> Of the players who made " Champions for Life , " only Mr. Bavaro will play Sunday . Phil Simms is injured , Jim Burt plays for San Francisco , and the other three are retired . But Mr. Mara remains co-owner of the team , and he remains devoted to this cause . So while you may look out over the field and see a spectacular pass , a tragic fumble , a triumphant run into the end zone , he may envision a colorful and lively backdrop for another 10-minute sermonette linking athletic prowess and moral superiority . It 's his right to do that . I just think it 's out of bounds .
