<p> Fort Valley , Ga . - It was barely sunrise when Ationo Lorzano hopped off a tractor hauling migrants to the orchards and raced to the nearest tree , its branches sagging from a heavy yield of the fruit that made Georgia famous . <p> " If I work fast , I can pick 120 bags a day , " said the 54-year-old peach picker , who sends whatever money he can to his wife and children in Mexico . Days in the sweltering orchards are tough , he added , but there 's more money to be earned if the crop is good . <p> And this year the fruit is not only flourishing in the orchards , but its image is enjoying renewed luster as a symbol of Georgia , the Peach State . Its use on lottery tickets alone has plastered the peach on billboards and stores from Hiawassee to Homerville . <p> It 's an image that has n't suffered a blemish even though the state lags far behind California in total production . And there 's not a single bruise in evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) after it initially was fined $ 1.1 million . The fine resulted from charges of smuggling in and employing undocumented workers last year . <p> " The peach has made a comeback , " said Hanna Ledford , deputy commissioner of the Georgia Department of Industry , Trade and Tourism . " It 's more of the connotation of the word than how many peaches you grow . And it 's not just marketing peaches , it 's marketing an idea . It 's a fun , friendly and exciting way to portray Georgia . " <p> Promotion of the product <p> Growers said the publicity has been good for business , but they also have begun their own promotions . For the first time , they are paying to plug the crop in new markets and are pooling ideas to combat massive California promotional efforts . <p> " In the past we did n't promote the peach as well as we should have , but all that 's changing , " said John DeWitt , president of the Georgia Peach Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change because the market changed . " <p> Lane Packing Co. of Fort Valley , the subject of last year 's INS raid , has been the most aggressive . <p> It advertises in major publications and along freeways across the East Coast and was the first grower in the state to establish a major retail operation at its packing house , selling peach cobbler , ice cream , preserves , T-shirts and caps . The foray represents a trend among growers seeking to market their products directly to the public . <p> Accusations of smuggling <p> Lane 's ability to persuade Kroger food stores to carry its peaches in attractive bags with the company 's colorful peach logo was a first for Georgia growers , reaffirming its role as an industry leader . <p> But last year , the INS accused the grower of smuggling thousands of undocumented workers into the Southeast and levied the $ 1.1 million fine against the company , the second-largest peach packer in the United States . The case was settled about three months ago for substantially less in an agreement that kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after a raid at the company . <p> The investigation of Lane substantiated INS allegations that the grower kept inaccurate records of migrants , underpaid them and housed workers in overcrowded company-owned dormitories , said Thomas P. Fischer , district director of the INS Atlanta office . <p> " But they have been cooperating , and we now feel they will follow the letter of the law , " he said . Peach growers , he added , are no worse than other large farm operations or big businesses when it comes to undocumented labor . <p> Duke Lane Jr. , who runs the family-owned , peach-packing company , said the investigation hurt business . <p> " We 're trying to grow peaches , " he said . " We have n't done any of the things they accused us of . " <p> Migrants provide labor <p> Lane hired its first migrant workers eight years ago . Picking Middle Georgia 's crop had been a job done mostly by black workers , but in the late 1980s the black crew chiefs who rounded up and supervised workers began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Valley city councilman who grew up picking peaches , said black people used to have no choice but field work because there were few other opportunities to earn money . Generations later , many have found employment in factories and have gone on to professional careers . <p> " When we were doing the work , our prayers were that our children not have to be subjected to the 100-degree work of the peach orchard , " said Mr. Crafter , whose son attends Fort Valley State College and has never picked peaches . " Migrants are now doing what we no longer want to do . " <p> While blacks still pick in some orchards and provide labor in the packing houses , where much of the packing process is mechanized , growers said they have been forced to turn to migrants to harvest the crop . <p> Perspiration , peach fuzz <p> Angelo Surez , 33 , has been picking peaches since he was 9 , but he 's never liked a day of it . He complains of long hours in the groves , the constant swatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Georgia sun . <p> The money , while a living , is n't a lot . On good days , migrants can earn about $ 45 to $ 80 , depending on whether they get hourly wages , a straight rate for peaches picked , or both . <p> " Picking peaches is the hardest job I do , " said Mr. Surez , who harvests everything from pole beans and cabbage in California to apples and grapes in New York . " The sun is hot , and baskets get heavy after a while . And the gnats fly in my mouth and up my nose . " <p> Pickers also battle peach fuzz , which is extremely itchy when exposed to bare skin . Workers wear long-sleeve shirts , heavy blue jeans and sometimes light jackets to cut down on the irritation . Many douse their bodies with baby power and cornstarch to weaken the potent combination of perspiration and peach fuzz . <p> Leader in chickens , peanuts <p> Just as conditions in the field have n't changed , neither has the world 's view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately be called the Chicken State or the Peanut Capital because it leads the nation in production of those commodities . <p> Alf Nucifora , an image consultant , said the peach gives Georgia instant recognition . <p> " Peanuts have a negative connotation , " he said . " As a symbol , it does n't have strength . It has a lot of Bubba in it - goober . With the peach , you do n't get that . <p> But in U.S. peach production , Georgia ranks third . <p> " The peach industry may not be what it once was in Georgia , in terms of trees and growers , " said state Agricultural Commissioner Tommy Irvin . " But we are still identified as the Peach State , and that 's more than what the folks in South Carolina and California can say . " <p> It 's an image that will only be reinforced in the minds of millions of football fans in January , when the Super Bowl comes to Atlanta . The peach is a part of the game 's logo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Bowl that was the essence of Georgia , " said Jim Steeg , executive director of special events for the NFL , " the peach was the natural choice .
