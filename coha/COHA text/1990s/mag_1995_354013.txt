THE UNITED NATIONS TURNED 50 this year , and in a historic gathering , more than 100 heads of state and government will celebrate the occasion next week . But as the potentates confer , socialize and speechify at U.N . headquarters and around Manhattan , some clouds will hang over the proceedings . If the U.N . is ever to solve the world 's problems , it had better first solve its own , and it has plenty . <P> Consider : the former head of a major U.N . agency routinely charged the organization for business trips already paid for by individual governments . A high official at U.N . headquarters in New York City is promoting the career of his mistress in a well-paid U.N . job . A key adviser at one of the U.N . ' s most controversial agencies is said to be an alcoholic too seldom sober to do much work . And the head of a worldwide agency is reputed to have bought his job by handing out cash  --  bundles provided by his national government stuffed into a suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their votes . <P> While these tales provide the most sensational illustrations of why reform of the U.N . system is urgently needed , they are not necessarily the most telling . It is true that " the U.N . is often used as a dumping ground for bureaucrats whom national governments want to get rid of , " in the words of Said el-Naggar , an Egyptian who was formerly deputy director of research at the U.N . Conference on Trade and Development . But less gossipy flaws have been at least as damaging to the U.N . ' s effectiveness and standing : bureaucratic confusion , duplication of effort , wasteful spending and lack of coordination  --  either among the alphabet soup of special bodies ( around 100 , according to one tally ) or with the so-called central U.N . in New York . <P> The U.N . has achieved remarkable success in feeding and sheltering refugees and in eradicating smallpox , to cite only two accomplishments . While a failure in Bosnia , peacekeeping has been effective in other parts of the world . But even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole the swarm of agencies , funds , commissions and regional offices has operated with an inefficiency that can no longer be tolerated . The entire U.N . system spends about $10.5 billion a year . That 's not a lot of money , considering the U.N . ' s mission ( it 's about one-third of New York City 's budget ) . Even so , if the U.N . does n't shape up in a hurry , it risks having its funds cut off by budget slashers in the U.S. and other nations . Right now the U.S. owes the U.N . $1.4 billion in back dues , but many Congressmen object to paying up . Reform would take away one of their strongest arguments , and President Clinton is considering ways to link a promise of reform to payment of the debt .
