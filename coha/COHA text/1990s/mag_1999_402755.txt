Birds Are n't Planets William Sheehan and Thomas Dobbins 's article " Le Verrier 's Wild Geese " ( October issue , page 112 ) overlooks or hastily dismisses serious problems with its claim that some sightings of the nonexistent planet Vulcan might have been migrating birds . Vulcan 's angular speed crossing the Sun 's disk would be hundreds of times slower than even a very distant bird seen from the ground . Nineteenth-century astronomers knew that Vulcan would take hours to cross the Sun , not seconds . The article bypasses this disparity by invoking " confusion about its reported speed , or misconceptions about how fast a planet transit would occur . " Is there any evidence of such confusion ? The flight direction of migratory birds is another problem . They would generally fly north-south . If they were seen and mistaken for Vulcan , their path would suggest a high-inclination orbit for the planet , very different from the 12deg inclination proposed by Le Verrier . Whatever the origins of false sightings of Vulcan , it does n't seem plausible to blame wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48F Ridge Rd .

The astronomical community is now holding its collective breath in anxiety about the Znamya 2.5 experiment , the giant Earth-pointing solar reflector that an orbiting Russian spacecraft is scheduled to deploy for tests in mid-February . Dark-sky advocates may be interested in studying the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 , to which the Soviet Union is a signatory . It appears that the Znamya mission will be in direct contravention of Article 9 , which in part states : " A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space , including the moon and other celestial bodies , would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , including the moon and other celestial bodies , may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment . " It could be argued that this clause might be interpreted to include exploration of celestial bodies by ground-based observers .

Krupp refers to the full Moon on September 6th as the Harvest Moon . At one point he writes , " the full Moon that hits the road closest to the time of autumnal equinox qualifies as a Harvest Moon " This is indeed the definition of the Harvest Moon , and Sky &; Telescope has long adhered to it . But the equinox came 16 days later , on September 22nd . The following full Moon came only 13 days after the equinox , on October 5th , so that one was in fact the Harvest Moon of 1998 - as Fred Schaaf correctly noted in the October issue . ATUL P.
