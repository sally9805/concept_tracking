He was a surprisingly unassuming man for such a titan among statesmen . His round , cherubic face belied a will of steel that had launched his vast land on the most remarkable transformation of the modern age . When death came to Deng Xiaoping last week , at 92 , he was nearly blind , deaf , virtually invisible and the honorary chairman of only the China Bridge Association . Yet even in his long political twilight , he still cast a shadow over the nation , at once reassuring and restricting the Chinese as they march uncertainly toward the 21st century . <P> The seismic changes Deng set in motion were daring , thrusting one-fifth of mankind in a Great Leap Outward from the crushing , dogmatic isolation of Maoism into a quasi-capitalist economic miracle . The China that comes after Deng will grow inexorably from the complex of roots he planted firmly in the nation 's soil . Yet his work is unfinished , and the next China will have to come to terms with the fundamental contradiction in his hybrid creation . Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deng insisted it be done under the iron fist of a rigid communist political system . The people would be free to get rich but not to challenge or change their leaders . Economic liberties would have to coexist with political bondage . China would continue to be ruled by men , not laws . <P> When this frail old man finally succumbed to the Parkinson 's disease and lung ailments that had sparked rumors of his demise for years , most Chinese registered barely a sigh . Black-clad television announcers proclaimed his death just a few hours after it occurred , while traffic continued to thread through Tiananmen Square . The casual manner in which Beijing residents went about their daily routines offered eloquent proof that the Chinese have accepted their leader 's mortality and long since discounted his loss . " We are at ease with the thought that things will be all right without Deng , " said Beijing writer Yin Zhixian . " It 's unlikely that there will be major changes , because everyone is a beneficiary of Deng 's policies . " Thirtyish Zhu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-conditioning firm , raised his glass of white wine at the chic Golden Age club in a fitting toast : " Thank you , Comrade Deng . " <P> Though he continued to wield an almost mystic influence from his private Beijing compound , Deng 's gradual withdrawal from overt power allowed his successors to prepare for an orderly transition . He was , like the ghosts Chinese revere , a force the current leaders dared not speak of disrespectfully . The steady rise in personal prosperity has persuaded China 's citizens that their new leaders will continue to follow in Deng 's footsteps without a major change of direction . <P> Yet for all their outward calm , the Chinese are as anxious as the rest of the world about their future . Jiang Zemin , State President , head of the party , chief of the military committee , the " core " of the new collective leadership , was ordained by Deng eight years ago and has been running the government pretty much ever since . But history has never been kind to China in its moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is confidence that these new leaders are firmly set upon the path of reform , there is equal doubt that they have the courage , stamina and leadership to complete the journey .
