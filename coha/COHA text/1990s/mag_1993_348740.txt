TITLE : THE FOURTEEN SISTERS OF EMILIO MONTEZ O'BRIEN <P> AUTHOR : OSCAR HIJUELOS <P> PUBLISHER : FARRAR , STRAUS &; GIROUX ; 484 PAGES ; $22 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Elegantly written , but do n't look for this male's-eye view of women on a feminist 's bookshelf . <P> Oscar Hijuelos is a master when it comes to writing hard-muscled , virile novels . His second book , The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love , a lusty tale of two Cuban immigrant brothers making their way as musicians in New York City during the 1950s , deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize three years ago , making him the first Latino novelist so honored . But this time out , Hijuelos has decided to tell his story through a woman 's eyes . Make that 14 women 's eyes . The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien is the title of his latest novel , and the book oozes with femininity  --  or at least with Hijuelos ' version of it . <P> Fourteen Sisters tells the story of the family of Nelson O'Brien , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a photographer during the Spanish-American War . There he falls passionately in love and marries the young and beautiful Mariela Montez . After the couple returns to the farm O'Brien owns in a small Pennsylvania town , he works as the local photographer and operates the community 's movie theater , while she keeps busy bearing and rearing their 14 daughters and , finally , one son , Emilio Montez O'Brien . <P> This is a big and ambitious book whose events span a century , and right at the beginning Hijuelos announces his intention to take his time telling it . " A lot of people wrongly discount the quality of photographs produced by the type of camera I use , " Nelson O'Brien tells his son Emilio in the quote that opens the book . " But this apparatus , in my opinion , captures not only the superficial qualities of its subjects but also , because of the time it takes to properly collect light , their feelings , as they settle on the subjects ' expressions ; sadness and joy and worry , with variations therein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates a series of vibrant snapshots from the lives of different members of the Montez O'Brien clan , all rendered in the writer 's exquisitely sensuous prose . The sisters are the title characters of the book , and there is much female activity , including cooking , childbearing and lovemaking , but Hijuelos is much too macho a writer to surrender himself entirely to a feminine  --  do n't even think about feminist  --  world . Thus a big chunk of the book focuses on brother Emilio 's exploits as he fights in Italy during World War II , beds his way through postwar Greenwich Village , beats the odds in Hollywood , where he plays Tarzan and Sam Spade-style detectives in B movies , and eventually gains fame as a celebrity photographer .
