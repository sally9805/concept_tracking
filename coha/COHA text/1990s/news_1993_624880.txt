<p> THIS year , almost every state will hold a special deer hunting season dedicated to hunters using muzzleloading firearms . <p> Texas is not one of them . Next year , however , it might be . <p> A push by the muzzleloader industry to create a special muzzleloader-only deer season in Texas seems on the verge of bearing fruit  --  although exactly what kind of fruit it 'll be remains a question that wo n't be answered until sometime in spring 1994 , when the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission sets hunting regulations for the 1994-95 seasons . <p> But if the consensus of a two-day meeting earlier this week concerning the muzzleloader issue is any indication , muzzleloaders could be looking at a short ( nine- or 16-day ) white-tailed deer season , perhaps limited to 15-25 deer-rich counties of central Texas , during which only antlerless deer could be taken . <p> Timing of the season might come in mid- or late October , or it might be set to start after the close of the regular firearms deer season . Or , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special muzzleloader-only deer season has been kicked around in Texas for several years , with interest waxing and waning but never reaching critical mass . Now , that critical mass seems to have been reached . <p> The Texas Legislature this spring passed a bill giving the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission authority to create and charge a fee for a special muzzleloader hunting stamp and setting requirements for the stamp 's use . Passage of that law seems the final shove needed to get the muzzleloading ball rolling . <p> Monday and Tuesday , about two dozen people met near Austin to discuss the muzzleloading issue . The roundtable discussion , hosted by the Sportsmen Conservationists of Texas and its executive director , Alan Allen , was designed to bring together many of the groups potentially affected by a muzzleloader-only season . <p> Its aim was to discuss the issues surrounding the a muzzleloader deer season and try to come up with some potential season dates and regulations Texas Parks and Wildlife Department staff can offer for consideration by the public and the TPW Commission . <p> " " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start out early in this process , to figure out where we want to go , let the public know ahead of time , and give everybody time to look at this issue , " said Bob Cook , chief of TPWD 's wildlife branch , one of several department officials at the meeting . <p> In addition to drawing TPWD officials , the meeting was attended by members of landowner organizations , muzzleloader manufacturers , dealers and organizations , bowhunter groups and aides to state legislators . <p> The meeting had the potential to be contentious . There are questions as to why a special muzzleloader season is even under consideration , and concerns that a special season would infringe on already-established hunting seasons and their constituents . <p> Almost all other states with special muzzleloader-only deer seasons have very short regular firearms deer seasons  --  some as brief as nine days  --  and the special season is seen as a way of greatly expanding hunting opportunity . But that 's not the case in Texas , where muzzleloaders can use their black-powder guns during the two-month-plus regular deer season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , hunters wanting to participate would be forced to buy new guns and accessories . That would put money in the pockets of muzzleloader manufacturers and gun dealers . <p> Also , because of the legislation passed this session , TPWD 's general fund would gain additional dollars through sale of the special muzzleloader stamp . The bill creating the stamp , SB 521 by Sen. Ike Harris of Dallas , sets the minimum fee for the muzzleloader stamp at $ 10 . <p> TPWD estimates about 25,000 people would buy the stamps if a season were set , resulting in approximately $ 243,000 for the agency . <p> Despite the lack of any mandate  --  biologically or from Texas hunters or landowners clamoring for a muzzleloader season , it 's pretty much a " " fait accompli " that Texas will see some kind of muzzleloader season . <p> The political pressure is too intense . Harris ' bill , while not mandating a special season be established , is just the latest and most pointed " " suggestion " that TPWD create such a season . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the selling points of a muzzleloader-only season is to increase hunting opportunity , then it 's counterproductive to take days away from an established season and put the muzzleloader season there . <p> Archers , who have an established bow-only season Oct. 1-31 that draws about 80,000 participants , certainly do n't want to lose part of their season to muzzleloaders . Neither do regular centerfire-using deer hunters . <p> The idea of taking part of the October-long bow season away from archers or shoving the opening day of regular deer season back a week or two and inserting a muzzleloader season is , simply , unacceptable to the parties losing hunting days . <p> The idea of creating a " " primitive arms " season during which both bows and muzzleloaders could be used was broached at this week 's roundtable . But it quickly was seen as unworkable . <p> The laws creating Texas ' archery stamp and the new muzzleloader stamp have clauses that require the stamps " " only " during a season exclusively devoted to each type of arm . If any other arm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp requirement is voided  --  that 's why archers are required to have an archery stamp if they hunt deer during the regular firearms season . <p> Where should a muzzleloader season be allowed ? <p> It would n't be biologically supportable to have another season in areas where deer herds could n't take the extra pressure . <p> That means the Pineywoods , Post Oak Savannah and Gulf Prairies  - -  ecological regions under conservative deer limits aimed at building the herd  --  are out of the muzzleloader picture . <p> The consensus of the roundtable group was that the deer-rich areas of the western Edwards Plateau and South Texas offered the best potential . <p> In the end , the group came up with three potential muzzleloader-only season ideas . The one that had the most support from the group was a 9- or 16-day muzzleloader season to begin on the Saturday after the Sunday close of regular deer season . <p> Hunters would be allowed to take only antlerless deer , and would be limited to 15-25 counties in the Edwards Plateau . South Texas could n't be included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer season that includes a post-regular-season antlerless-only hunt that runs into February . <p> The other two options offered by the group were : <p> A muzzleloader-only season sandwiched between a two-part , archery-only season . The first bow-only season would run , roughly , from mid-September to the end of that month . <p> A muzzleloader-only season would begin on the first Saturday in October and run through the second Sunday of the month . The second part of the bow-only season would begin the third Saturday in October and continue through the end of the month . <p> A muzzleloader-only deer season sandwiched between the archery-only season and the regular gun season . The archery season would open in mid-September and end in mid-October . Muzzleloader season would cover the last two weeks or so of the month . <p> Those are the rough proposals TPWD will flesh out and offer to the commission as options . <p> " " This is not a done deal , " said Rudy Rosen , director of TPWD 's wildlife and fisheries division . The three options developed at the roundtable are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Final word on the season rests with the TPW Commission . <p> No official proposal for a muzzleloader season will come until January . That proposal , along with other hunting regulation changes , will be subject to public hearings in February or March . <p> The commission probably will make a final decision on the season at its March 1994 meeting . <p> This week 's meeting was big move toward creating a muzzleloader-only season acceptable to Texans , those attending the gathering agreed . <p> " " I was surprised by the way it worked out , " said Randy Reeves of the Lone Star Bowhunters Association . " " We were concerned about losing part of our season , but there are ways to avoid that . <p> I think this is a good first step . " <p> Frank Sweeney of the Dallas Muzzleloaders Club agreed . <p> " " It 's not perfect , " he said of the rough proposals coming from the meeting . " " But it 's a good start . "
