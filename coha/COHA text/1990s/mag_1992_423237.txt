<p> A variety of factors make fishing for bass in the Hudson River unique and attractive . <p> Fishing for largemouth bass in the Hudson River Estuary provides a challenge and a fishing experience beyond that of most other bass waters in New York . Many serious bass anglers with specialized boats flock to the Hudson for weekend fishing tournaments . The magnificence of the river with the challenges of tidal habitats and its impressive fishery keeps drawing them back . <p> The primary bass region in the Hudson River Estuary extends from Troy to Newburgh . Downstream of Newburgh and for the 60 miles to New York City , the water in the main channel is more ocean-like and less attractive to bass . When seawater intrusion increases salinity to one-third that of the ocean , the young bass seek refuge in freshwater tributaries such as the Croton River . <p> To some extent , Hudson River bass do things differently than bass in New York 's other inland waters . Hudson River bass have some home ranges that are larger- , they congregate in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coves protected from waves and low tides ; and because they feed well for a prolonged period , they grow exceptionally fast . Ecology and Biology <p> Bass in the Hudson River are a part of the most diverse and productive freshwater community in New York : one that is intimately linked to the sea and millions of ocean-run fish . These ocean migrants , including American shad , alewife and blueback herring , invade tidal areas in spring to spawn and stay for a few weeks . They leave behind just-hatched young which resident or " local " bass welcome with large , opened mouths . <p> Largemouth bass found their place in the Hudson River over a century ago through stocking efforts and canal links to the Great Lakes drainage . Because the Hudson contained many other predatory fishes , largemouth bass had to compete with these fishes , including : the ocean migrants striped bass and American eel , the resident white catfish and the previously introduced smallmouth bass . Nevertheless , largemouth bass became one of the dominant gamefish in the freshwater reach of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of sewage pollution in the river restoring the river 's impressive aquatic production . <p> The spawning requirements of bass in the Hudson River differ in several respects from bass elsewhere . According to 1988 studies by Cornell University , four out of five shallow water nest sites selected by male bass in the Hudson were failures . This high failure rate results from disturbances from waves , low tides , drawdowns associated with large ships and sudden heavy silt loads that suffocate eggs . As in other east coast estuaries , successful nest sites are usually located in protected weedy coves or behind levees . <p> Cornell University studies , funded by the Hudson River Foundation for Science and Environmental Research , documented timing and habitat selection of largemouth bass spawning in 1987 and 1988 . These studies found that successful spawning occurred in coves along the middle estuary and that young-of-year bass were most numerous in nursery habitat between Cornwall and Kingston . In some years , young bass are produced in greater numbers than in other years . To date , 1991 produced the highest measured numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fry , have an abundance of food awaiting them ; and as long as they do not become a meal themselves , they grow rapidly . Their exceptional growth stretches some of the largemouths to more than seven inches by their first fall . Fast growth continues through the succeeding summers . Nowhere else in New York do bass grow so rapidly and reach legal size ( 12 inches ) after only three growing seasons . In addition , there are few waters in New York with so few older bass . StudieS show that less than six percent of Hudson River bass are more than seven years old compared to bass from other waters which frequently reach ages eight to 12 and older . This shorter life may well be a physiological cost of faster growth or possibly a result of the rigors of river life . <p> Another unique feature of many Hudson River largemouth bass is the black pigmented patches on their outer skin . The cause is unknown but is under study . Preliminary laboratory and field studies indicate there are no damaging effects from this coloration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant or as troubling as a symptom of chemical pollutants in the water . These pigmented patches are commonly seen on bass in other coastal rivers south of the Hudson and in several inland impoundments of the central , southcentral and southeast United States . Approximately one out of four Hudson River bass over 12 inches display this marking . bass in only one other water in New York , New Croton Reservoir , are known to have a high frequency of such patches . <p> Many fish species develop behavioral adaptations to increase their survival in different waters . Two such behavioral traits have been observed for Hudson River largemouth bass . The first trait is that adult Hudson River largemouth bass usually move over a large distance within a year . In a study conducted by DEC between 1982-1985 , the median distance moved by Hudson River bass was about seven miles . However , some bass were recovered as far as 65 miles away . Cornell University researchers tracked 15 spawning bass in 1987-1988 and found most had moved two to 10 miles from their wintering areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Glenmont ) to spawn and was found the next spring back at Saugerties . Compared to Hudson River bass , largemouth bass in lakes generally stay within smaller home ranges and move distances under four miles . <p> The second possible behavioral adaptation is that Hudson River largemouth bass congregate in a few special wintering areas . This has been observed in bass populations in other coastal rivers to the south , and may be an adaptation to the constantly shifting tidal currents . These wintering areas and nearby deep water basins offer resting areas at a time of year when prey abundance is low , bass energy reserves are low and survival is threatened . More than half of the Hudson River 's largemouth I- ) ass in 1988 resided in as few as five small wintering areas : Coxsackie Cove and the tidal bays of Catskill , Esopus , Rondout and Wappinger creeks . <p> Hudson River largemouth behave as " home bodies " toward their wintering areas . Eighty to 90 percent of recaptured bass came from the same wintering areas where they were first marked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their protection . <p> The wintering area at Coxsackie Cove had a dramatic decline in bass numbers between 1986-1988 , which coincided with the erosion of a nearby protective dike . To reduce tidal flow rates and to restore wintering habitat value , the dike was restored in late 1989 . Bass appear to be reestablishing themselves - in the fall of 1991 Cornell biologists boatshocked many yearling and two-year old bass . Fishing <p> Hudson River bass received national attention because of the quality of the fishing experienced by tournament anglers during the eighties . With important bass attractors such as weedy coves , protected bays , rock piles and wooden pilings , the Hudson River channel provides ample opportunity to catch bass . Tributary bays like the lowermost or tidal portion of Catskill , Esopus , Rondout and Wappinger creeks are popular bass fishing areas . <p> Tides play an important role in successful bass fishing on the Hudson River Estuary . Living spaces and underwater shelter are keys to locating favored bass habitat on the river during different tide stages . Once anglers understand the tidal influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Either largemouth bass or smallmouth bass might be favored by an angler , and techniques are specialized for each species . Tournament anglers in the summer catch four times more largemouth bass , but keeping program which showed that Hudson River catch rates of largemouth bass and smallmouth bass were among the best in the state . These experienced anglers caught an average of one legal-sized bass ( 12 inches or longer ) in every two hours of fishing ; very close to rates from the high ranking St Lawrence River ( one legal-sized bass per 2.5 hours ) and the lower Mohawk River ( one legal-sized bass per 1.7 hours ) . Bass size quality in the Hudson was also high  --  bass more than 15 inches made up to one-third of the angler catch . <p> Tournament action has been exceptional , and these eight hour per day contests have stayed very popular . Since 1977 , when DEC first began keeping tournament records , fish entered in tournaments have averaged two pounds . The rate of fish entered in these tournaments has changed from one bass for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every six hours of fishing ( 1987-1991 ) . While the abundance of Hudson River bass appears to have declined , the average size of the fish caught has remained large . <p> When fishing the Hudson River , it is important to remember that change is the day-today routine . If some fishing spots or lures become unattractive to the bass , anglers should look to new lures , new places and new habitats . Techniques and hotspots are conveniently summarized in Jim Capasella 's book Good Fishing In the Catskills , Stackpole Books Publishing . Local tackle and bait shop owners are a good source of up-to-date information on the latest lures and techniques for successful Hudson River bass fishing . Managing the Fishery <p> Continuation of an abundant and high quality fishery is the intent of DEC fishery biologists . Management objectives have been established which include a tournament entry rate at better than 1.4 legal bass per angler trip and an average weight of tournament  --  entered bass of over 1.9 pounds . With the exception of 1990 , these objectives have been met or exceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts indicate the objectives are not being met , then additional management actions will be applied . <p> The quality fishing in the Hudson River is no longer a mystery to anglers or biologists and is expected to stay high . The main reason popular bass fisheries decline is because of removal of larger bass . Bass removal from the Hudson is low because most anglers voluntarily practice catch and release fishing . Tournament rules promote catch and release efforts by penalizing anglers who enter dead fish . in addition , most fish are returned to the water because of a health advisory recommending against consumption of Hudson River bass due to elevated PCB levels . Catch and release will help both largemouth and smallmouth bass continue to provide quality fishing in the Hudson . <p> A final note : each aspect of the Hudson River bass population is linked to or responds to the tidal environment . The factors affecting their life-style have required patient study to understand . Through cooperation of two DEC regional offices ( at Stamford and New Paltz ) , Cornell University and many tournament anglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus been able to set targets for the continued quality of the fishery . <p> Photo : Hudson River Largemouth Bass ( PAINTING BY ED KENNEY ) <p> Photo : Largemouth bass from the Hudson are characterized by the black pigmented patches on the outer skin ( D.
