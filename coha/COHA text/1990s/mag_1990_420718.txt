Section : Access FIVE OF THE BEST PARKS FOR RAPTOR WATCHING <p> BY ALMOST ANY MEASURE , raptors , or birds of prey . are amazing creatures . They are fast , powerful , and beautifully proportioned . Above all , they are built to hunt . Their wings . talons , and large keen eyes have evolved for that single purpose . <p> Hunting raptors dart among trees , plunge into oceans , glide over fields in the night . Owls can hunt entirely by sound , and virtually all raptors have extraordinary powers of sight . Peregrine falcons , said to swoop at speeds of up to 250 miles per hour , may be the fastest creatures on Earth . <p> The following five national parks are among the most exciting places in the nation to view these magnificent birds . <p> Golden Gate National Recreation Area <p> Migrating hawks are not always easy to see . Thermals of air , found most abundantly along the ridges that many hawks follow during migration , carry soaring hawks high into the sky in great spiraling kettles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is rare to find an area where large numbers of migrating hawks will fly low enough to show the flight patterns and rich markings that bring us out to see them in the first place . <p> Golden Gate National Recreation Area is such a place . In the fall , viewed from the high bluffs of the Marin headlands , hawks may fly at eye level or even below you as they migrate southward . They have followed , like most hawks , either the coast or the inland ridges . At Golden Gate , where the Pacific Coast meets the Coast Range , two streams of hawks converge . <p> Most common are red-tailed hawks , sharp-shinned hawks , Cooper 's hawks , and turkey vultures , which together comprise about 90 percent of the roughly 10,000 hawks counted at Golden Gate each fall . Broad-winged hawks , rarely seen in the western United States , are found each fall in surprising numbers at Golden Gate . <p> Though the flight season lasts throughout the fall , the best time to see large numbers of migrating hawks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitor center at Fort Barry Chapel offer some of the best views . <p> Public hawk-banding demonstrations are conducted every weekend during peak season by the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory as part of its ongoing raptor research program . <p> For information , contact Golden Gate National Recreation Area , Fort Mason , Building 201 . San Francisco , CA 94123 , ( 415 ) 556-0560 . <p> Everglades National Park <p> Unlike fast-hunting falcons and accipiters , kites seem content to hover and glide , buffeted by the wind . They are temperate , slender hawks with a liking for warm climates and a name inspired by the wind toys that fly , like they seem to , at the whim of the wind . <p> Everglades National Park is one of the Park System 's best hawk habitats and one of only a handful of places in the United States where four species of kite can be seen . Three kite species nest in the park : the black-shouldered , the snail , and the unmistakable swallow-tailed . A fourth species of kite , the Mississippi , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers of bald eagles and ospreys also nest here . In recent years approximately 50 pairs of eagles and 200 pairs of ospreys have been found . <p> Winter may be the best time to see hawks at Everglades . Look for large numbers of American kestrels , a few merlins , and scattered peregrines chasing shorebirds along the coast . Swainson 's hawks and short-tailed hawks , rarely found elsewhere in the East , are good winter finds . <p> A prime place to start looking for hawks at Everglades is the road to the Royal Palm Visitors Center , where there are wide views of the open sky . Look here for short-tailed hawks , most common in winter . <p> For more information , contact Everglades National Park , P.O. Box 279 , Homestead , FL 33030 . <p> Apostle Islands National Lakeshore <p> Thanks to a weird confluence of factors , Apostle Islands National Lakeshore is another good place to see unusually low-flying hawks . <p> Located off Wisconsin 's Bayfield Peninsula , the Apostle Islands stumble out like stepping stones into the cold waters of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow the islands into the lake . Twenty miles later , at Outer Island , the thermals of warm air collapse over the cold lake water , and the birds , facing a seemingly endless expanse of water , falter and turn around . Of the small number that continue across the lake , many will die of exhaustion before they ever see the north shore . <p> The numerous hawks that turn back to shore offer a great show to anyone intrepid enough to brave the islands of Lake Superior in early spring . Stand at the southwest end of Outer Island to see them return , very low to the ground , flapping against the wind , the thermals gone . <p> Many will be sharp-shinned and broad-winged hawks , along with smaller numbers of Cooper 's hawks and American kestrels . Apostle Islands also reports very strong merlin flights , with a healthy smattering of peregrine falcons . <p> In addition , the park funnels thousands of passerines ( perching birds ) , waterfowl , and shorebirds northward every spring . Park officials have counted as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head for Long Island , at the extreme southern end of the park , to see large numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds and good flights of falcons and sharp-shinned hawks . The heaviest concentration of hawks is in spring , between April 15 and May 5 . <p> Normal daily temperatures during spring flight , however , range from 30 to 50 degrees , and the lake can be partially frozen into May . Accessibility can also be a challenge . Before early June , when the water taxi service opens , you will need to hire a private boat from the mainland . <p> Apostle Islands may not be the easiest park to reach for hawk-watching , but it offers a trip you will remember . For more information , contact Apostle Islands National Lakeshore , Route 1 , Box 4 , Bayfield , WI 54814 . <p> Big Bend National Park <p> For Mexican border specialties and a wide selection of other raptors , head south to the deserts , mountains , and river canyons of Big Bend National Park . <p> Four rare border species-the Harris ' hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the zone-tailed hawk-may be found under the right conditions at Big Bend . Just this year gray hawks produced two young in a nest along the Rio Grande . <p> Grays and Harris ' have been seen in the Rio Grande Village area , and black hawks are occasionally seen in the Davis Mountains to the north . Zone-tails are most often seen in the Chisos Mountains , soaring like turkey vultures with their wings held in a shallow V-shaped dihedral . <p> Other common species can be seen more often . A native population of fifteen pairs of peregrine falcons inhabits the areas , where they soar to heights of four to five thousand feet . Sharp-shinned and Cooper 's hawks prefer the more wet or wooded regions of the park . <p> Also found are kestrels ; harriers ; prairie falcons ; red-tailed , ferruginous , and Swainson 's hawks ; and elf , great-horned , and flammulated owls . Mississippi kites are occasional spring migrants . <p> Hawks are good at Big Bend in any season , and bird walks are held weekly thoughout the year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79834 . <p> Gateway National Recreation Area <p> Every spring , blown to the coast by a western wind , thousands of hawks follow the New Jersey shoreline to a spit of land called Sandy Hook . They are a few of the many thousands of hawks that migrate , by ridge or by coast , through Greater New York every year en route to warmer climates . <p> For the last 14 years the Cape May Bird Observatory ( CMBO ) has conducted hawk studies at Sandy Hook , the southernmost unit of Gateway National Recreation Area . Every spring CMBO reports counts of five to ten thousand raptors , the most common of which are sharp-shinned hawks and American kestrels . Merlins , Cooper 's hawks , and northern harriers pass through in smaller numbers , with peregrines , red-shouldered hawks , and broad-winged hawks lagging behind . The most fortunate observers may see the lone swallow-tailed kites that show up about once every spring , nearly a thousand miles north of their traditional range . <p> Hawk season is April and May at Sandy Hook , with counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather at the embankment near Sandy Hook Lighthouse . The lighthouse offers good views of the beach route preferred by many low-flying birds . <p> Gateway is one of several Atlantic coast parks used by large numbers of migrant raptors . Assateague Island , Cape Hatteras , and Cape Lookout National Seashores are other good areas to visit . Assateague is known for fall peregrines , which have been counted and banded there for more than 20 years . <p> For information on Gateway , contact Gateway National Recreation Area , Floyd Bennett Field , Building 69 , Brooklyn , New York 11234 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The fast-flying peregrine falcon preys almost entirely on other birds . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : When migrating , ferruginous hawks follow ridges and shorelines . <p> By James Toole <p> <p> James Toole is public a hungry raptor , might feel little sympathy . But raptors , some of the world 's most graceful and powerful predators , are under constant threat . <p> Until well into this century the threat was hunting , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called DDT that weakened raptor eggshells and threw many populations into severe decline . <p> In recent years the National Park Service has established raptor recovery programs in parks with important raptor habitat Although some NPS plans involve species reintroduction most aim to help native populations recover through monitoring and inventory-taking projects . <p> Programs to recover the peregrine falcon . one o the raptors most harmed by DDT. have become models for national park raptor recovery efforts . By 1973 , when DDT was finally banned , nesting peregrines had disappeared completely from the eastern United States and were rare in the West . <p> Today , sites such as Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in the Southwest and Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve in Alaska report almost 50 nesting pairs each year . and Grand Canyon an estimated 100 pairs . <p> The Park Service is also involved in cooperative programs with other federal agencies and private research groups . One program has established a uniform peregrine banding protocol throughout the western states . Another program studies the continuing effect of contaminants that travel through the food chain , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human development , which destroys open space in the U.S. at an alarming rate of one million acres per year , squeezes raptors into ever-shrinking corners of the country . Under these conditions , the fight to protect national parks , and the pristine habitats they preserve , will become vital . <p>
