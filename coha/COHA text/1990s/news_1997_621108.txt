<p> THE ROYALS <p> By Kitty Kelley <p> Warner ; 547 pages ; $ 27 . <p> A few hours before her book " The Royals " went on sale yesterday at bookstores around the country , author Kitty Kelley got all choked up on ABC 's " Dateline . " <p> The death of Princess Diana , she told Jane Pauley , made it an emotional trauma to go on with plans for publication . She did n't mention that she would also appear this week on the " Today " show , " Larry King Live , " " Good Morning America , " " Entertainment Tonight , " CNN and " Rivera Live . " Nor did she say that a million copies of her book had been rushed for delivery a week ahead of schedule in a brazen effort to snag a thread in the coattail of royalmania after the accident in Paris . <p> " The Royals " contains little material that serious royal-watchers have n't read before . The only satisfied buyers of the book are likely to be johnnies-come-lately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Four years ago , Andrew Morton , Nigel Dempster , James Whitaker and Lady Colin Campbell all published books that told most of the insider 's stories  --  Prince Philip 's philandering , Queen Elizabeth 's fondness for sex , Diana 's personalized riding lessons , Fergie 's personalized toe massages , etc.  --  and A.N . Wilson wrote at the same time about the chances for the survival of the House of Windsor . <p> Kelley 's titillating tattles about Elizabeth Taylor , Frank Sinatra and Nancy Reagan were minor preparations for this 550-page work . Imag ine Liz , Frank and Nancy in multiple generations with tiers of talkative servants , randy relatives and self-proclaimed best friends . It 's no wonder that Kelley found people to talk about the royals . There were so many , it 's a wonder that she ever found time to get off the phone and write . <p> In " The Royals , " the author casts herself in the role of intrepid American  --  " If a cat may look on a king . . . so can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start in pumping up an image of herself as a woman undaunted by threats of lawsuits from Buckingham Palace . So few of the book 's revelations are fresh , though , that it looks as though the decision not to publish in Britain  --  loudly ascribed as a suit-avoiding maneuver  --  may have been a trade-off for increased publicity in America . <p> By early yesterday afternoon , Stacey 's on Market Street had sold 32 copies of " The Royals " ( Warner ; $ 27 ) . At a Clean Well- Lighted Place for Books , Roger Pantano said the last literary work to sell so quickly was Thomas Pynchon 's " Mason &; Dixon . " Book Passage in Corte Madera was busily tabulating telephone orders . " It 's going to do well , " said Nancy Perkins . <p> Because Kelley has few bombshells , she works herself into a literary sweat trying to portray scandalous behavior . In what seems like an all-out effort to attract outrage , she heavily peppers the text with  --  horrors !  --  intimations that various characters were/are gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of those streets , Kelley presents hints of these assertions both as straight-on allegations and as allegations that the royals are bad because they disdain gays and Jews . <p> The book begins strangely with a tale of Princess Margaret walking out of a screening of " Schindler 's List , " which she is said to have called " a tedious film about Jews . " According to Kelley , the princess had gone to the movie hoping for a story about a good German . Later on , Kelley writes that Antony Armstrong-Jones ' mother was Jewish ; also , that he is bisexual . <p> Among others " tainted " with one brush or the other are Edwina and Lord Mountbatten , the Duke of Edinburgh , Prince Edward , Princess Anne 's husband Timothy Lawrence and the Duchess of York 's boyfriend Steve Wyatt . <p> Kelley 's assertion that Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret were conceived by artificial insemination is interesting in a clinical sort of way , but it 's just one of the many details crammed helter-skelter into the book without analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely into Diana 's camp , she obviously intended in the text to mete out aspersions and sympathetic comments evenhandedly : Di took along two Danielle Steel novels on her honeymoon , writes Kelley . Prince Philip 's opinion of his prospective daughter-in-law : " She can breed height into the line , " a comment Kelley writes was made " as if she were a brood mare . " <p> As for sources , the book contains a huge list of names and thank yous , but they are unalphabetized , forcing the reader to pore through the pages . <p> Mentioned are : Caroline Kennedy ( but is she the Caroline Kennedy , and is n't her name Schlossberg ? ) ; Diana 's step-grandmother Barbara Cartland , who was miffed when she was n't invited to Di and Charles ' wedding , but still cares enough about the royals to have asserted this week that she never talked with the author ; Erica Jong , whose expertise is mysterious and whose input is invisible ; and tens of professional gossipists from the British tabloids , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , People magazine , all of whom are rushing to write about the book that writes about them . <p> Kelley mentions neither Dodi Fayed nor any other of Diana 's postmarriage boyfriends . But she does seem prescient in describing the princess ' relationship with the press after she divorced Charles : <p> " Photographers still showed up in full force to cover her because she remained the most famous woman in the world . But they started acting like hooligans . . . . Once adoring , some photographers acted as if she had personally offended them by losing her royal status . . . . Without the protection of her royal nimbus , Diana had been reduced to celebrity camera fodder . " <p> AUTHOR 'S DIRT ON THE HOUSE OF WINDSOR <p> For the convenience of the fan of the royals who 'd rather spend the $ 27 on a rhinestone tiara than on Kitty Kelley 's " The Royals , " a list of revelations follows : <p> * Princess Margaret has plastic flowers in her apartment . <p> * Princess Elizabeth took amphetamines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the installation of washing machines at Buckingham Palace . <p> * Queen Elizabeth and Gina Lollobrigida used the same corset maker , but the queen , " who had the same kind of prominent bosom " as the actress , opted for minimizing her assets . <p> * When the press caught Prince Charles making love to a girlfriend near Balmoral , he jumped up and hid in the bushes , leaving his girlfriend to pull up her pants on her own . This was considered by the press to be ungentlemanly . <p> * Queen Elizabeth is so cheap that when she gave her staff at Sandringham potted chrysanthemums one Christmas , notes were attached to the plants asking that the pots be returned to her gardeners . <p> * Mark Phillips was required to provide a semen sample for potency testing before he married Princess Anne . <p> * Queen Elizabeth invited 2,500 state dignitaries and public personages to the wedding of Charles and Diana .
