THERE WAS POP ART . AND OP ART . NOW comes the latest postmodernist art form : Stock Art . Michigan entrepreneur Lawrence Wilsher is offering the public single shares , appropriately framed , of the Walt Disney Co . He sells the certificates not for their face value but rather for their worth as actual works of art  --  replete with Walt 's visage and images of such classic Disney characters as Bambi , Dumbo and Mickey . Wilsher 's mixing of art and finance earned the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission , but the agency has confirmed that he does not have to register as a broker as long as he offers only framed certificates at well above market price . He charges $112 , frame included , for a Disney share that brings $45 on the Big Board .
