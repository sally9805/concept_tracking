My father came from the old country in middle age , and to his last he instilled in me the peculiarities of his native tongue . Even now , at the age of seventy , I am left with his manners of speech , his inflections and growls . He left me with his sayings , and I recall one in particular , his favorite , a half-comic shout of equal parts exasperation and petition : " Help me , Father Alphonsus ! " <p> Most often this was uttered in moments of high disgust . My father worked as a hod carrier until he was seventy , a job that condemned him through all those years to being eternally strong and eternally exhausted . At night , sitting in his chair in the parlor of our tenement , he would brood over the five of us , his children , as we bickered over one thing or another  --  the last scrap of the night 's loaf , a new toy pilfered from a classmate  --  and he would take on the resigned look of a condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man he had known long ago . And then , if my mother did n't rush from the kitchen to herd us from danger , my father would often hit one of us . <p> Even late in life he had ridged muscles along his chest and back . His face was etched with a sunburned and skeptical squint . When we were young , he hit hard . When he sat down again , walled in now by the wails of a child , he 'd rub the sting from his cracked hands and fall into a black mood . " Forgive me , Father Alphonsus , " he 'd mumble . The meaning always seemed clear . My father was a man of weakness and vices , and he made no apologies . He prayed for strength in the face of us . Much later in life I found myself praying aloud to Father Alphonsus a time or two , such as when my own son stole a car . The matter was quietly settled in the office of a police-department captain , with the victim of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son quietly sobbing . Father Alphonsus , the faceless man of grace , hovered ethereally over the proceedings . <p> Alphonsus , my father told us , was the most well-intentioned man he had ever known , " if such things should count for anything . " Alphonsus was a near relation , the keeper of faith in Fenagh , the hamlet on Lough Ree where my father was born . <p> " He was a man who knew nothing but to offer the best he could , " my father said . " I have neither his patience nor his benevolence . " My father was n't cruel , but he lived a life of bricks on his back , the stabbing workday sun , and day's-end liquor bought with the desire for the most liquid at the lowest negotiable rate . He 'd drink and play our battered phonograph , closing his eyes and giving himself over to the crackling arias . Though he often invoked the name of his old village priest , he found no priest here to be worthy , and he fell away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen and was offered a scholarship to Boston College , he complained bitterly that I could do better than to deal with Jesuits , insincere bastards that they were . I suspected that my father could have done much better than his dire life , but he seemed not to want to , could n't fully engage in the way things were . It did n't seem unusual that a hod carrier would prize his books , his Greek classics and sweeping histories . He was Irish , and illegal . He could not become lace-curtain Irish , and my father had nothing good to say about those who were . He maintained through his life the sidelong glance he had learned when he first came off the boat , before he found my mother and married her . <p> This Father Alphonsus was one of the few people mentioned from my father 's youth . I had no sense of what the man was like , his look or manner . At times I wondered if he was real . But one day , late in his life , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . <p> This would have been 1952 . My father was about the same age as I am now , but he was much closer to death than I assume myself to be . A resolute smoker of filterless Camel cigarettes , he was in the advanced stages of cancer of the larynx , which at the time was virtually incurable . In the nursing home , in a wicker wheelchair , he talked compulsively despite the ongoing strangulation of his voice box . He 'd take a deep breath and then release it in long , rattling phrases , and I would sit and listen to monologues about his job and friends and enemies and crooks and aces . Later , in his yellow-walled hospital room , he 'd go on and on while I watched the rectangle of sunlight glide imperceptibly across the waxed floors and then fade and die . I sensed in all this talk a spiraling movement toward something central . He had , he told me , things he needed to say . Important things . What happened on Father Alphonsus 's final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six , born six weeks after his father 's death by pneumonia , and from the moment of his birth his mother had unshakable plans for him . Alphonsus would be her last chance , and she was the kind of woman who felt that producing a priest was a fitting and necessary act of completion to her maternal career . From the earliest age Alphonsus was groomed for sacred duty . She made him tiny knitted vestments and pasteboard altars as playthings , enlisting his older brothers , rougher boys , to encourage Alphonsus to believe that he was different . Alphonsus 's mother spoke to him nightly about the duties he would assume , bedtime tales about faith and good works . His oldest brother , Eamon , explained to him about celibacy , and none too charitably . But Alphonsus listened and nodded . The details Eamon so eagerly shared , using examples of his own sordid exploits as proof of what Alphonsus would miss , horrified the younger boy . Eamon waited then for a response . Alphonsus 's nightly sessions with his mother allowed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad , " Eamon said . Alphonsus , even as a child , was looking forward to the priest 's solitary life . His heroes were the Irish hermits of the Middle Ages . He read stories of their lives on the rocky islands off the west Irish coast , lives of gray skies and gray seas . These stories filled him with awe for the heroism embodied in shunning the world . <p> Sacrifice did not define the process of Alphonsus 's rise to the priesthood . He slid through seminary and took up his works back at St. Enda 's in Fenagh , his boyhood church . When his superior , the aged Father O'Donnell , passed away on the night after Christmas , 1906 , the twenty-six-year-old Alphonsus became his village 's spiritual leader . <p> Nights , standing in his bedroom as rain washed the windows of the drafty stone rectory , he thought that he did n't regret what he had become but that he would n't ultimately measure up . The feeling was n't new . He had completed his studies with neither distinction nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had enough intelligence to see his own utter lack of intuition . Could a priest , confronted with the fluid nature of reality , afford not to rely heavily on hunches and inspiration ? In his small room in the seminary he prayed long and searchingly , believing that a sudden feeling of enlightenment or resolve might be transmitted from the Creator . But when he finished with his prayers , he felt nothing . <p> In the first dozen years or so after ordination things went relatively well . His posting to the village seemed clear notice that not much was expected of him from his superiors . Alphonsus presided over the reassuring cycle of dawn masses , funerals , and weddings ; he taught catechism and organized a football team of the younger boys . These were the things Alphonsus had imagined himself doing effectively . He 'd stand at the edge of a rain-softened field , the winds off the lough making the edges of his cassock snap and tighten around his legs , and he 'd watch the boys , some playing barefoot , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant then , affecting a sternness he recalled in O'Donnell . He hoped to instill in them the fear he 'd held of the old man . But at the same time , he felt small and weak in the face of the unanticipated crisis . It had not yet happened , but he knew its inevitability , if not its form . He felt that these things could be seen by the shrewd among his parishioners : His stammering uncertainty when faced with the difficulty of a pregnant girl , Amanda Flynn , asking to be quietly married , even though half the town had already heard whispered dispatches of her condition . Or the town 's thieves and adulterers and his sheeplike acceptance of them sitting in the front pews , their faces masks of haughty and false devotion . He would meet their eyes briefly and then look away . <p> One day , after years of this stoic service , Alphonsus awakened early to a knocking on the door . This tapping was light but relentless , on and on until he had let his eyes adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was three o'clock . An early riser , Alphonsus was surprised to be rolled out of bed , and the insistent softness of the knocks as he descended the stairs indicated to him a call for last rites , perhaps for the elder John Flanagan , who 'd been kicked shoeing a horse and was not expected to recover . At the door he found a boy , perhaps ten years old , shivering . <p> " Father , you have to hear a confession , " the boy said . <p> " Pardon ? " <p> " A confession . You hear confessions , do n't you ? " <p> " Well , I thought you were ... " Alphonsus felt a twinge of anger . " Of course I hear confessions . But I generally do n't find children on my doorstep at odd hours . Now , get inside here . We 'll do it in the study , and it had better be good . " <p> " It 's not I who needs to , " the boy said . " The person is waiting inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the boy stand in the entry while he ascended the stairs to change clothes . The oddity of this demanded confession made him suspicious . For a shaky moment he worried that this would be a robbery . He sat at the edge of the bed , still in his underclothing , his cassock across his knees . He tried to place the boy 's face . The child was not one of his footballers ; the face was reminiscent of the O'Neals , a family of beggars who lived in a beaten-down mud cottage outside the town , near the lough shore . Alphonsus heard the door below open and then shut . The thought of what might be afoot  --  being lured out by the boy and then thrashed for his pocket watch  --  made him wary . Alphonsus went to the bedroom window and looked out . The boy had left the house and now stood on the dark lawn with a man . They were shadowy forms , but he could see that they were looking up at him . The man raised his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised index finger : one moment . The man nodded . <p> When Alphonsus came out the door , he felt the glassy cold cutting through his sweater . The man and boy moved forward to meet him , in the steam from their own breathing . The man , his face hidden by the pulled-down front of his cap , was staring at the ground . <p> " The boy said you 'd gone inside the church , " Alphonsus said . <p> " No , Father . He 's right inside the confessional . " <p> They stayed in the yard while Alphonsus went in . He fumbled for a candle at the back of the nave , still half waiting for hands to seize at him from the dark . But in the weak light the church was still . He entered the confessional , snuffed the candle , and slid back his screen . <p> " Are you there ? " Alphonsus said . <p> " Aye , Father . " <p> " Then go ahead . " <p> The voice began its mumbled recitations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondered about the elder John Flanagan and whether he had lived through the night . Alphonsus was feeling light and electric , not quite anchored in the dark . He realized that the man had stopped talking . <p> " Go ahead , " Alphonsus said . <p> " Father , I 've breached the Fifth Commandment . " <p> Alphonsus was silent . He was sure the man was confused . <p> " Do you mean adultery , then ? " he said . <p> " No . " <p> " Tell me the Fifth Commandment . " <p> " Thou shalt not kill . " <p> Alphonsus felt strangely calm . This was the first time he 'd encountered such an infraction . A killer ! He silently recalled the seminary lessons : Forgiveness is the priest 's task , punishment the law 's . <p> " Who ? " Alphonsus said . <p> " I do n't know his name . " <p> " Who knows about this ? " <p> " No one , Father . " <p> " Not your friends outside ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And where is the dead man ? " <p> " In the woods near the lough . " <p> " Is that where you killed him ? " <p> " That 's where I did him , Father . " <p> Alphonsus leaned back against his bench . He told himself to go slow . <p> " And while you were standing over his body there in the woods , were you feeling remorse for your act ? " <p> " I felt sorry I had to breach a commandment . " <p> " Was it self-defense ? " <p> " In a manner of speaking . " <p> " What manner was that ? " <p> " That we are all in danger , Father . " <p> " Some men , to prove their remorse , might turn themselves in . " <p> " Aye , " the voice said . " Some might . " <p> " And why not you ? " <p> " Others will be involved . Others who do n't deserve such troubles . " <p> " How so ? Troubles from whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Oh , my , " Alphonsus said . He ran his fingers along the starched smoothness of his collar . Matters had taken on a more troubling dimension . He now understood that the dead man was a policeman from the RIC , the Royal Irish Constabulary . Four years had passed since the Easter Rising in Dublin , and in this four years of undeclared civil war the RICs , seen by many as agents of British rule , had often been targets . The RICs were Irishmen , but more and more the younger men had left the ranks , some openly disavowing their ties , others simply slipping out , often to England . Those who remained were the older hands , who after years of service were not sure whether to be more afraid of the Irish Republican Army or of a lost pension . But with each new death of a constable came more recrimination and violence . <p> The Black and Tans , since they 'd been brought in from England , had begun a policy of retribution that was as simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Tans generally burned the village nearest the killing . Alphonsus did not need to calculate the distance to the shores of Lough Ree : as a sport fisherman , he knew the lough , a landlocked elbow of water a mile wide and eleven long . <p> " Father ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " My penance ? " <p> Good God ! Was this how simple it should be ? Alphonsus was speechless . Penance ? He sat for a long time , thinking , wondering whether he could somehow find a way to consult with someone . What was the penance for such an act ? <p> " I can grant no penance yet , " Alphonsus said . " I want you to return here at the same time tomorrow night . I want you to do nothing except pray . Take no action . Now , where is this body ? " <p> " Father , I do n't know if . . . " <p> " Good Lord , man ! Tell me where this poor lad is , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know the path to the rock formations on the east side of the lough ? " <p> " I do . " <p> " He 's twenty or thirty yards north of the path , about a quarter mile up from the shore . " <p> " How did he get there ? " <p> " He was answering a call for help . " <p> The man fell silent . Alphonsus could hear his breathing . <p> " Father ? " he said . " Father , I thought you had to grant penance . " <p> " Not in the case of the Fifth Commandment , " Alphonsus said . " Most people have no experience in this . " He quivered at his own lie , but his voice remained firm . <p> As Alphonsus sat in the confessional , listening to the receding footsteps and then the slam of the church door , he rubbed his hands on his knees , trying to calm himself . Indeed , he was thinking of the town of Balbriggan , which had burned a few weeks before at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alphonsus wondered , could this man who had spoken to him in the confessional truly be repentant , having known what his actions would lead to ? Alphonsus thought not . But he had , from his training , clear guidelines : as much as he wanted this man to turn himself in , he could not require it . And doing so probably would n't help , once the dead man was discovered . The Black and Tans , so called because of their odd makeshift uniforms of khaki army trousers and black RIC tunics , were men in whom the cruelty of war had become ingrained . They were being paid ten shillings a day , good money , but still they often sought as payment the suffering of those they saw as enemies , which was nearly anyone Irish . <p> Alphonsus relit his candle . The movement of the shadows in the boxed closeness of the confessional made him think of the lick of flames . The Black and Tans ' terror felt close at hand . Why should anyone be absolved ? <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders and then returned to the rectory for breakfast . The housekeeper , Mrs. Toole , had brought in a two-day-old copy of The Irish Times , and over his toast he went through it slowly , looking for news on the Troubles . In the village he had heard talk of how the Black and Tans had taken to roaring down Dublin streets on a lorry , wildly firing their weapons ; in Kiltartan a woman was dead , hit by stray shots with a child in her arms . But in the Times he found no mention . <p> He changed into his gardening clothes . His flower beds faced the woods , and at the edge of the trees he had vegetables . He spent hours here , for the priesthood had not proved to be excessively demanding . Many days he stood at his fence , watching the movements of the drawn carts and of his parishioners , the cottiers coming from the clodded potato fields . Far off , on an open meadow , unfurled bolts of linen bleached in the sun , long white bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he contemplated the early-morning confession , and the meeting that night . He felt ludicrous standing here in the garden , but at the same time he wanted to be nowhere else , for he was alone . <p> Down the rutted lane that curved behind the near cottages he saw Sean Flynn , the retired schoolteacher , walking his dog . The animal , runty and of no clear breed , dug at a rabbit hole . Flynn , leaning on his cane and softly cursing the dog , saw Alphonsus , and ambled up . <p> " Father ! " <p> " Mr. Flynn . " <p> " Have we been fishing this week , Father ? " <p> " I confess I have n't . But soon . " <p> " Father , the weather 's turning cold . " <p> " I know , I know . It 's pitiful that I have n't . " <p> " Today , then . " <p> " No , I have some matters . " <p> " Father , clear your mind . " <p> " Perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I will , Mr. Flynn . Really . " <p> " Today . " <p> " Yes , today . " <p> It would be his reason , then , to go to the lough . In the house , packing his equipment , he slipped in his stole and oils . He put on a clean cassock and adjusted his biretta , his priest 's crown with its hard sides and pompon . Mrs. Toole was down below , dusting in the dining room , and he went to the kitchen to pack a jam sandwich . <p> " I 'll be off fishing now , " he said . <p> " Today ? " she said . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " With Mr. Flanagan on his deathbed from that horse kicking him ? " <p> " Um , well , I 'll be back by midafternoon . I heard he 's doing better . " <p> " Really ? Who told you ? " <p> " Mr. Flynn . We were just talking outside . " <p> Mrs. Toole went back to dusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> " Every chance I get , " Alphonsus said . <p> " Father ? " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " You 're fishing dressed like that ? " <p> " If anyone does need last rites , I do n't want to do it in my fishing clothes . I sha n't be long , anyway . " <p> The row from his usual fishing spot to the shoreline edge of the path was longer than he was used to . After pulling his boat onto the rocks , he walked up and down the path several times , first making sure no one was near , and then beginning to scan the thick woods for any sign of the body . The killing had been in the dark , he assumed , so perhaps the instructions were confused . The day had become brilliantly crisp , and he could n't see anything human amid the play of shadows and light . Alphonsus stepped off the path and walked broad circles , searching , pulling up the hem of the cassock so he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , too , in case someone came . He would n't have an answer if asked what he was doing . <p> After an hour he sat . He unfolded his sandwich from its greased paper and ate , thinking . He had , in his estimation , covered nearly every possible spot where a body might be . He wondered if this was a hoax . He was too exhausted and tense to fish , and the winds beyond the woods seemed to be picking up . Had he been fishing , he might have been in dangerous waters . He wished he did n't have to return to the village , to the confessional . Bad things were to happen , and he had no idea how to stop them . If he did n't find the body , someone else would : the absence of this constable would eventually become known . Though some constables deserted , slipping away to the north or across to Britain , Alphonsus reasoned that only proof of a desertion would curb the Black and Tans ' impulse for destruction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man in the confessional was stronger , a mixture of revenge and principle he could n't shake free of . He did n't know if that man had been an O'Neal , but he was certain the man was like the O'Neals , someone embittered with his lot and perhaps too willing to blame everything on the British . But he had to absolve , to heed his vows . When his sandwich was gone , he walked down to the lough and drank at water 's edge from cupped hands . Back up the path , but now not as far from shore , he plunged into the woods , again searching . <p> The body was half hidden with wet leaves , the accumulation on the windward side like dunes overtaking a pyramid . Alphonsus knelt , put his hand on the shoulder , and gently rolled the man on his back . <p> " Hello , Thomas , " Alphonsus said . <p> He had n't considered the possibility that he would know the deceased . The body was that of Thomas Shanahan , a royal constable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lough . Thomas had from time to time come to mass at Alphonsus 's church . Alphonsus had made a point of welcoming him , for he believed that all were equal in the eyes of God . Thomas was also a fisherman , and after mass they had often talked of their favorite spots . Thomas 's face was clean , his clothes neatly straight . He was n't in uniform but in thick wool trousers and shirt , as if off duty . Alphonsus turned him again , and now saw the crust of hardened blood on the back of his head . As he removed his oils and stole from his fishing kit , Alphonsus scanned the trees , ready to become prone should he hear footsteps . <p> Thomas was middle-aged , a bachelor who , Alphonsus sensed , was as private a person as he . Thomas lived in the RIC barracks , but in his conversations with Alphonsus never spoke of any of his mates . But of course one could n't , in the same way that Alphonsus understood he would hear no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alphonsus , as he daubed the oils upon the cold face , assumed that Thomas had deplored all this , and Alphonsus did n't care to know different . <p> When he finished the last rites , Alphonsus sat for some time on a rock , looking at the body . How had Thomas come here ? Had he been ambushed fishing ? No rod or kit lay nearby , but those might have been spoils for the killer . He could go on speculating , but he could n't avoid what he now planned to do . From his own bag Alphonsus extracted his trowel , the best he had been able to manage without being noticed . He walked in a circle around Thomas , looking for the softest and highest ground , and then knelt and began digging . <p> This act , he knew , transformed him . He had no business doing this . The dirt did not give way as easily as he 'd imagined ; he 'd felt , coming out in the boat , that he could be back at the rectory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hours into it , he stood back and looked at the pitiful rut he 'd clawed out , and he laughed in despair . <p> " Tommy , " he said to the body , " I damned well do n't know what to do with you . This just is n't Christian , is it ? " Tommy , on his side , stared out onto the lough . <p> Alphonsus peered up through the trees , not able to shed the sense that he was being watched . He had the feeling that the killer might come back , to see that the body was still there . The IRA wanted the body to be found , surely , so that a bloody raid by the Tans was inevitable . The killing of a fellow Irishman like Tommy would create doubt and ambivalence unless it was followed by the necessary retribution by the Brits . Was he being used in this ? Did someone expect that Alphonsus himself was going to report the death ? Or would the killer return , having thought things over , to put Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to bury Tommy , but Alphonsus now saw that he was n't capable of finishing the job . The hole was barely two feet deep . Alphonsus recalled his grandfather 's stories of the Famine , of skeletal men burying cloth-shrouded friends as packs of starving dogs gathered at the periphery , yelping with hunger and bloodlust , set to dig as soon as the living moved on . <p> " Forgive me , Tommy , but I can barely move now , " Alphonsus said . " I thought my gardening had made me fit enough to undertake this . " <p> A wind was picking up on the lough , making the water choppy and whitecapped . The row back would be dangerous if he did n't go soon . He felt a rising panic . He would have to drop Tommy into the deep waters  --  he saw this . He 'd not be back until well after dark , but his midnight confession awaited . He 'd have to be there or the killer would certainly have suspicions . <p> Down by the water he searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around , but no means of attachment . His fishing kit could be loaded with them , but the top was loose and the ballast might fall out as the package sank . Alphonsus saw one way to do what he needed to do . Standing above the body , he removed his cassock , and then pulled off Thomas 's pants and shirt . <p> Getting the cassock onto the body was easy . Thomas was a bigger man than he , but the cassock was loose . Alphonsus adjusted the braces of Thomas 's pants and rolled up the pants and shirt cuffs so that he was clothed for the stealthy trip back to the rectory . In a pocket was a purse with Thomas 's papers and a sizable bit of money . Alphonsus was surprised that this had n't been taken . <p> The boat rode low on the water with two men in it , the dead one loaded down with stones , the live one weighted by the terror of being caught . Alphonsus had used his fishing line to bind the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the collar was snug at the neck . The last trace of sunlight was nearly gone . Alphonsus stroked hard against the winds , slicing out toward the rough middle of the lough . <p> He was a sinner now  --  he could see that . He would dump a dead man into the cold waters as if he were a load of garbage , would grant penance to a murderer . He would return to his rectory , slip past Mrs. Toole so that she would n't notice his inexplicable change of clothing , and spend the rest of his life trying to live with this . And all he wanted was for no one to be hurt . So be it . If this body somehow resurfaced or washed to shore , with a cracked skull and wrapped in a cassock , so be it . Or if the Tans correctly interpreted Tommy Shanahan 's disappearance and overran Fenagh anyway , so be it . " So be it , Tom , " Alphonsus said . " A week will pass and you wo n't turn up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He stopped rowing . The moon shone through a break in the clouds , giving definition to the far edges of the lough . To say a prayer at a moment like this seemed crude and sacrilegious , desperate and artificial . But he prayed now anyway , prayed for guidance . <p> Nothing came to him . He felt that matters were on an inevitable course and he could do nothing but send Tommy to the bottom and then go home . " Do as we must do , " he said to the body . <p> He grabbed the shoulders of the cassock . He crouched in the boat , the balance becoming uncertain , and then he lurched and Tom hit the gunwale . The boat was listing . Water was pouring in . He had imagined a noiseless letting-go of the body , but now Alphonsus was in a fight , and in his panic he was n't sure whether he was trying to shove the body away or pull it back on board . But neither was happening and now he was underwater , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see only a single blurred spot of weak light . He wanted to reach for it , that moon in the sky over on the other side of the surface . His hands were still clenched to the bunched fabric of his own cassock , now weighted with death , and he let go of it , and the solid block that was Thomas grazed his leg and ankle and then was gone . <p> Alphonsus had been hanging on to the side of the overturned boat for some minutes when he decided that he would not return to Fenagh . That he would survive was not a given ; the water was cold enough and his arms were tired enough from the digging that he felt almost nothing , except for the dull pain of the thick muscles along his neck . But he clung on , the wind and waves rocking him in crests and swells , until he was desperate enough to push away from the boat and swim for shore . <p> His thought , as he crawled out of the water on his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floating like an ornate ship far out of reach , its black pompon now a keel . He had seen it from the boat , puffed by the wind and etched by moonlight , unwilling to sink with the cassock . The boat , too , would be found , far off on the lough , known by those fishermen who knew him . <p> In the woods he undressed , squeezed water from his clothing . He considered trying to light a fire . Naked in the cold air , he plunged into the water again to clean himself , and then dressed in the wet woolen shirt and trousers . His black brogans squished loudly when he walked , but he was moving quickly . In no time he was well up the path and along the rutted highway toward Dublin . By dawn he would find a ride in a chicken lorry , and by that evening he would use Tommy Shanahan 's wet money to get a room over a public house by the docks . Three days later , his clothes dry and black stubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bribe a dock worker to get him into the steerage of the first ship leaving Ireland . The dock worker would ask , " Why are you going ?

And when these words were out , the dock worker 's face would be twisted with revulsion and the story of his flight would be common knowledge in Fenagh in a few days ' time . <p> My father , telling this story thirty-two years later in a wheelchair in the rest home where he would die , told me that this is how he came to be a man born in middle age , with a name picked from a city directory .

I boarded an Aer Lingus 747 packed with alumni , and we sang drinking songs high over the Atlantic . Only on the day after the football game did I think to rent a car and take a drive . Asking in Dublin , I found no one who 'd heard of Fenagh , but I set out toward Lough Ree , and on its eastern shore I got directions to the town . There I parked , and walked the length of its primary streets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , without going in . At a small shop I talked to the keeper , a man older than I , and he told me he had a niece in Boston he sometimes went to visit . I told him I 'd had a relative here , a Father Alphonsus . <p> " Of course , " he said . " I 've seen the plaque . " He pointed me down the road toward a knoll overlooking the water . There , behind some overgrown brambles , I found an engraved plate , the size of an envelope maybe , mounted on a rock . <p> " Father Alphonsus Kelly , RIP . Drowned November 5 , 1920 . " I stood on the knoll and looked at the harsh waters where this man had lost his life and become someone else . He was a man who became old and could not aspire to the better part of himself he believed he had squandered  --  who had come to find , I think , that in his exile he could n't bring himself to try to be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our lives . Standing at the edge of the lough , I said a prayer for my father . I petitioned that he might be delivered from a purgatory of which I had been part . <p>
