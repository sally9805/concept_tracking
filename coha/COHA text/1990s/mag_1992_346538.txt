Jealousy , perhaps the oldest and certainly the most pernicious of human emotions , is always fascinating to behold , the more so in politics , where ambition invariably trumps loyalty , and old grudges are carried to the grave . In general in recent years Republicans have held their egos in check  --  with the notable exception of the far right , which abhors all who fail to slavishly toe its line . Most mainstreamers , however , follow the G.O.P. 'S " 11th Commandment " ( " Republicans shall not speak ill of other Republicans " ) and only rarely strike at their own , as Bob Dole did recently when he dissented from the Bush campaign 's anti-Perot blitz . While Dole 's stance was unwelcome , there was only the slightest there-he-goes-again headshaking at the White House , for everyone knows that Dole is a special case . He has never recovered from losing the 1988 Republican nomination to Bush , and his leadership position in the Senate demands that he be treated gingerly . And besides , no Bushie really had the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the nation 's educationally challenged Vice President was a bit wide of the mark when he charged that Ross as Boss would destroy the Constitution ( although , come to think of it , the hapless Quayle 's insistence on adding an e to potato may have been due to his having immersed himself in the great document 's archaic 18th century spelling ) . <P> But Dole 's mild correction was a sideshow . As usual , it was the Democrats , past masters of the art of party perfidy , who went squarely about the task of nicking their embattled nominee . Who exactly was leading the charge ? Why , those who even a casual observer could have predicted would most warm to their indictments , Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo , two men who have signaled repeatedly that if they themselves can not be President , they will not sleep well if another Democrat captures the prize . <P> Poor Bill Clinton . His sin is that he wants to win and that he understands that victory requires his adopting centrist positions . Since the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are anathema to traditional Democratic liberalism  --  and often before audiences ill disposed to hear his message . Some have argued that in a three-way race he should retreat to the Democrats ' base of minorities and liberals . Clinton 's view is contrary and is the product of two assumptions  --  his belief that Perot will fade , which would leave him to contest the crucial middle with Bush , and his knowledge that even if Perot 's unprecedented strut continues unabated there simply are not enough core Democratic votes to win .
