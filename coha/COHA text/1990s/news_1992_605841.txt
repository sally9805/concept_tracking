<p> Elizabeth and Richard Banks recall being somewhat awestruck when they first visited the Crestwood community to celebrate their friends ' 25th wedding anniversary . The Bankses headed up the well-traveled 16th Street corridor from the heart of the city , turned left onto Upshur Avenue NW and entered a world of wooded groves , stately homes and rural serenity that the two native Washingtonians never imagined could exist less than 15 minutes from downtown . <p> " Suddenly it seemed like were way out in the suburbs somewhere , " said Elizabeth , a retired federal government employee who has been corresponding secretary for one of the neighborhood 's two citizens ' association for more than 20 years . " There was no traffic , no city noise , just the voices of small children playing in their yards , and the houses were so beautiful and large , I thought this is the ideal place to raise children . " <p> The Bankses returned to Crestwood to do just that , buying a roomy brick home in 1960 that featured porches on the first and second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter could play . " I knew when we came here that this was a place that were going to stay for a long , long time . " Richard said . <p> Bounded by Colorado Avenue to the north , 16th Street to the east , Randolph Street to the south and Rock Creek Park on the west side , the area that is commonly known as Crestwood actually began as two separate communities . The area 's northeast portion , once loosely associated with the 16th Street Heights community , was developed beginning in the 1920s as a sylvan alternative to hustle and bustle of urban life . Nestled in an arc north of Rock Creek Parkway , the community of large , custom-built homes attracted a mixture of wealthy and working-class Jewish and Catholic residents in its early years . <p> Beginning in the 1940s the primary nesting ground for Washington 's black elite began to shift from LeDroit Park to the upper 16th Street corridor , earning the strip its title as Washington 's " Gold Coast . " <p> Meanwhile , a separate development of homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constructing a community of spacious detached brick homes on 187 lots that Stone called the " Crestwood Community . " <p> A former stonemason , Stone sought to create a tony suburban community close to the city with elegant homes that often featured expansive entrance foyers , maids ' quarters , first-floor libraries , screened-in porches , and Easter egg-colored tiled bathrooms . Buyers can often identify homes built by Stone through the basement shower stalls that usually feature a surplus of tiles in several shapes and colors that form a kind of funky mosaic . <p> Stone also meant for his community to be exclusive and included restrictive covenants in the deeds that barred Jews and blacks from buying in his Crestwood subdivision , said John Eason , an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner for the area who owns a home in the Crestwood subdivision and has researched the neighborhood 's history . Such covenants were eventually struck down by the courts and the subdivision took on a greater ethnic mix . <p> Over time , the community inside Colorado and 16th colloquially became known as Crestwood .

" There are very , very wealthy people in the neighborhood and some who are just regular old middle class folks and I like that . I want my son to grow up around all kinds of people and that is what we have found here . " <p> The stately Colonial , Tudor , and Beaux Arts style homes that have graced Crestwood 's sloping streets over the years have been home to many of Washington 's empire builders , including Phil Lustine , whose family founded a string of successful automotive dealerships , N.M . Cohen of Giant Food Inc. , George Beverly of the Beverly Ice Co. , the Wellington family that founded a chain of jewelry stores that bears its name , Malcolm Gibbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who owned the Washington Senators baseball franchise . <p> The more than 1,000 residents who call Crestwood home now include FBI Director William Sessions , Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( D-N.Y . ) , Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson , D.C. Council member Linda Cropp , former D.C. police chief Maurice Turner and professional golfer Lee Elder , along with large concentrations of judges , physicians , architects , journalists , college professors and lawyers . <p> The number of attorneys who live in Crestwood is so large that the neighborhood is featured in a number of jokes that poke fun at the legal profession . One such wisecrack suggests that anyone wishing to carry out William Shakespeare 's suggestion to " first , kill all the lawyers " should visit K Street by day and Crestwood by night . <p> Crestwood 's most prominent resident today is Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D-W.Va. ) and his wife , Sharon , who live in a sprawling 22-acre estate tucked away in a southern corner of Crestwood near Rock Creek Park . Rockefeller paid $ 6.6 million for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost Crestwood 's stature and home values . <p> The Rockefeller purchase and the go-go real estate market of the past decade caused home values throughout most of Crestwood to double from 1980 to 1989 , according to home sale records . In recent years the average rate of appreciation has slowed , ranging from 6 percent to 10 percent , according to real estate agents who specialize in Crestwood and the 16th Street corridor . <p> Today homes in Crestwood sell for $ 200,000 to $ 750,000 . <p> While residents welcome the rise in their home values , some worry that over time it will erode the neighborhood 's socioeconomic diversity by making it difficult for working-class families to muster the massive down payments required for pricey homes . Crestwood recently was listed as one of the Washington region 's best-kept secrets by Washingtonian magazine because its homes , while costly , are priced well below similar homes in neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park , such as Forest Hills , Woodley Park , Burleith and Chevy Chase . One factor that accounts for the price differential is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Lafayette Elementary , Deale Junior High School and Wilson Senior High . <p> Most parents in Crestwood do not send their children to the neighborhood public schools , which include West Elementary and Roosevelt High School . Instead , most choose private schools or public schools west of Rock Creek Park . <p> Crestwood is a neighborhood known for its civic activism . When the Washington Tennis Foundation built its tennis stadium at 16th Street and Colorado Avenue , residents of the neighboring Crestwood community held their breath and hoped that the traffic during the twice-yearly tournaments would not impose on the serenity of their enclave just west of Rock Creek Park . <p> But when the Tennis Foundation asked the National Park Service to approve a plan to expand the schedule of events to include boxing matches and two-ring circuses , the Crestwood community collectively cried foul and waged a battle that is still being fought to restrict the stadium 's schedule to two tournaments per year . <p> Crestwood residents do not suffer intrusion easily and fight hard to protect the peace and quiet in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about zoning violations at a service station on 16th Street until the station finally shut down and sold most of the property to a Greek Orthodox church . Likewise , Crestwood residents successfully fought a church 's plans to convert a neighborhood estate into a nursing home in the 1980s . <p> The residents do n't win all their battles . The Crestwood Civic Association , which was formed to represent the exclusive Crestwood subdivision , tried in vain to prevent builder Harry Poretsky from building a large apartment house at 16th and Shepherd streets .
