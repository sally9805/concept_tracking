While the political and military combatants were waging peace down in Managua last Thursday , the U.S. Senate was raising hell into the night about who should get credit . Democrats wanted to hail Chamorro and Ortega . Republicans liked the former but wanted to zing the latter for suggesting that he could continue to govern " from below . " Kudos were lofted for former President Jimmy Carter , arbiter of the ballot box , and Costa Rica 's President Oscar Arias Sanchez , who won the Nobel Peace Prize for devising a regional peace plan . Then minority leader Bob Dole added his footnote to history : " There would not have been an election if President Reagan had not been around here keeping everybody 's feet to the fire for eight years . " <P> Until now , it has been hard for Reagan to reap anything but blame for the sad events in Nicaragua . Reagan inherited a Marxist on the march in Managua . He embraced the contras as " freedom fighters , " slapped on trade sanctions and thoroughly riled Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran-contra scandal . He is still paying for that fiasco . <P> $ Time for a little fairness . The end result of the Nicaragua episode seems to be what the U.S. has vainly sought all over the globe in its support of freedom ; few American lives were committed or lost , with a cost of only $300 million in U.S. aid for the contras . Nicaraguans sustained the fight until conditions outside and inside the country were ripe for a shift of power . Compare Viet Nam  --  58,000 Americans killed , $150 billion spent , the nation rent in bitterness , a bitter defeat . <P> Most U.S. operations in Latin America have been like tragicomic operas among the banana trees . Recall John Kennedy 's Ivy Leaguers running around in their chinos and sneakers , trying to cloak the Bay of Pigs disaster while massive U.S. power sat unused off the bloody beach . Or Lyndon Johnson pouring 20,000 troops into the Dominican Republic , after exaggerating to reporters about headless bodies lying in the streets , blood running in the gutters and bullets whizzing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most notable for the 8,600 medals that were handed out to 7,000 troops . And it was not that long ago that George Bush sent 24,000 American soldiers into Panama , in December . Twenty-six Americans died , and it took 15 days to take custody of Manuel Antonio Noriega . <P> But now and then there does emerge a constellation of events that seem to create a sort of magic . Jimmy Carter spotted Ortega 's militarization . The national debate forced U.S. restraint , the news media enforced a kind of rough honor system , and the global communist pretense collapsed . Finally the world came to watch the election showdown . Hungry and poverty-ridden people quite naturally opted for change through the dignity of the ballot box . <P> Some of the battered warriors who marched the long way with Reagan called him up last week to thank him , among them George Bush and Dan Quayle . And there was a note in the mail from one of the world 's master power brokers . Richard Nixon sent his personal well-done . If Reagan deserved some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  --  then he deserves some of the credit for the final tally .
