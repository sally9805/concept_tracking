It 's over . it 's just begun . last week the prosecution in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson rested its case  --  appropriate terminology since the whole drawn-out affair has been exhausting . This week Simpson 's so-called Dream Team of lawyers begins its defense , and jurors and trial watchers can only pray they do n't live up to their name in the soporific sense . In half-time analyses , legal pundits have seized upon the numbing numbers the trial has generated : so far , there have been 92 days of testimony , 58 prosecution witnesses and 488 exhibits . Ten jurors have been dismissed and 12 books published ( one by an ex-juror ) . Los Angeles County has spent $5.69 million on the case , and that 's just through May 31 . But the most important number is still 4013970-Simpson 's prison ID . Will he have to continue to wear it ? Will he be found guilty or not ? <P> " Prosecutors across the country  --  and I 've talked to them  --  have not seen such an incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says Jeanine Ferris Pirro , the district attorney in New York 's suburban Westchester County , who has never lost a felony trial . And yet many O.J. watchers agree with an L.A. deputy district attorney not assigned to the case that " the presentation was herky-jerky . The prosecutors are the filter through which the jury ' gets it , ' and this case just did n't have continuity . ' ' Says veteran criminal defense lawyer Don Wager , who has covered the case for the cable sports channel espn : " This jury has to pan for gold . The gold is there ; they just have to look for it . ' ' The problem , he believes , is that Marcia Clark and her colleagues did n't know when to leave well enough alone . " I mean , spending eight days with the coroner ? ' ' <P> Moreover , some defense experts believe the defense team , led by Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. , has already succeeded in establishing a reasonable doubt and should rest its case right now . Day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by poking pinholes in the testimony but also by conjuring several alternate crime scenarios-that the police are framing Simpson , that police incompetence tainted evidence and/or that drug hit men committed the crimes . " Basically , the majority of our case has been presented through cross-examination of prosecution witnesses , " says Simpson 's attorney Robert L. Shapiro . " They prosecutors have been required to go on the defensive . " And that , says veteran defendants ' lawyer Gigi Gordon , has " taught lawyers all over the country how to do it if they have the resources . Now they should know when to sit down . My motto is , if you do n't stand up , they ca n't shoot at you . ' ' <P> Team O.J. , however , is hoping for the big score : an outright acquittal . Without one , Simpson must remain in jail awaiting a second trial , and his expensive lawyers must weigh the image costs of abandoning the case once they 've depleted O.J. 's fortune . But to get one , Simpson may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get acquitted unless he takes the stand , ' ' says Los Angeles defense attorney Andrew Stein . The risk is that he would then have to withstand cross-examination on every piece of circumstantial evidence , but Stein for one believes he might pull it off because " he has such presence . ' ' Gordon disagrees : " If he were my client , I 'd be standing there with duct tape . I 'd be saying , ' If you want to commit suicide , do it on your own nickel . ' ' '
