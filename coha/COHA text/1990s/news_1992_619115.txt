<p> The gigantic golf ball of the Epcot Center dome at Disney World in Orlando , Florida , claims to enclose a bright view of our future . Perhaps so . But the cultural blight and degraded environment of South Florida suggests another fate entirely  --  a future of mountains of garbage , plains of suburban sprawl , streams of polluted air and tainted groundwater . <p> As California finally attempts to come to terms with growth , and the prospect of formal goals and controls , Florida offers an object lesson . People swarming onto the land without guidance of an environmental master plan inevitably create catastrophe . <p> As I grew up near the edge of the Everglades , three decades ago , it seemed that a wealth of life forms  --  the orchestra of insects trilling in the brush , the huge flights of birds undulating overhead , the panther that left its massive track in the swamp near our house  --  would enrich this world forever . <p> Last month , I heard that the last two breeding female panthers known to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the probable cause . Another female panther found dead in the park a year ago had enough mercury in her liver to kill three humans . <p> One of the suspects : four massive garbage incinerators perched on the east border of the Everglades that are creating huge amounts of toxic ash and vapor from the unsorted garbage  --  including batteries and plastics  --  that is tossed into their maws . The oldest incinerator , Montaney , is said to spew more than a ton of mercury and seven tons of lead every year . <p> Scientists at a recent conference hosted by the Sierra Club said that this area had one of the worst mercury contamination problems on the continent . Much of the wild food chain is going toxic . In some places the soil is heading toward a level of toxicity that will no longer support natural bacterial activity . <p> Recently , the Everglades National Park reiterated a startling edict : Fishermen were enjoined from eating any freshwater fish caught anywhere in the park . This statement was issued by the park 's special environmental task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the Everglades from total ecologic collapse . <p> The ' Glades are so vast , with sheets of water flowing south through 10,000 square miles of sawgrass , pinnacle rock and the hardwood groves called hammocks , that it seems nothing could hurt them . But South Florida 's swarms of humanity have mounted a concerted attack : draining away water before it can reach the ' Glades ; polluting the water that does reach the swamp with agricultural runoff ; and introducing exotic plants for domestic landscaping that soon began to spread wild , crowding out the native species . <p> The discovery of the swath of mercury staining the saw grass is just the most recent addendum to a list of plagues . Much of the task force work has gone into a federal lawsuit to make the state of Florida enforce its own water quality regulations on the big sugar growers to the north . More task force work goes into preventing Dade County from adding a new civic well field on the ' Glades border , and sucking another 140 million gallons of water a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures are cited in the catastrophic decline of wading birds . Great flocks of roseate spoonbills , snowy egrets and wood storks once formed clouds over the Everglades ; the birds are now at a mere 10th of their numbers in 1950 . <p> The problem is people . First , sheer numbers . The Florida population shot up by 50 percent from 1981 to 1991 , and is expected to nearly double  --  to 20 million  --  by 2020 . Between 600 and 700 people per day move into Florida to live . In the face of this human avalanche there are no master plans or controls based on health of the environment or the carrying capacity of any ecosystem . <p> What there is is a legal principle called concurrency . This just means that builders ca n't construct in areas with insufficient schools , streets and water delivery or waste systems . Once a moratorium is triggered by an overcrowded human infrastructure , the developers simply lobby for another bond issue , more civic systems are built , and business proceeds as usual . The prospect of winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier . How could it be ? The watersheds are already overcrowded . <p> The other problem is how these people behave . The national garbage production rate in the United States is 3.5 pounds per person per day . In South Florida , despite publicity about the problem , this rate stubbornly remains at an astronomic 8 pounds . Environmental groups have fought to get the Florida Legislature to pass a glass recycling " bottle bill " for the last 15 years without making much headway . <p> And it 's this swelling stream of garbage from a growing population that has Florida 's human culture starting to choke in its own waste like a bacteria culture slamming up against the glass walls of a petri dish . Those incinerators fume away on the edge of the ' Glades because if all that garbage was not being burned , it would just get dumped into a solid landfill . And the Florida landfills are already a surreal phenomenon . <p> The highest land mass in all of South Florida is a virtual mountain of garbage just south of Miami . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . This structure  --  dubbed " Mount Trashmore " by locals  --  currently holds an estimated 8 million tons of shredded garbage . Dade County 's solid- waste management people say they must get new permits to expand Mount Trashmore from three " cells " ( large storage units ) to five , and raise the height to 250 feet . <p> In the meantime , Mount Trashmore is creating quite a legend for itself . In 1988 , the whole mountain caught fire . Until that giant plume of burning methane gas was extinguished , it made an effective midnight beacon for ships sailing into the Port of Miami from the Atlantic . <p> One of the mountain 's other effects is less visible but more pernicious . Even though the landfill 's first cells were put near Biscayne Bay , they were installed below groundwater level , with no protective liner of any type . Builders thought the natural marl , or mud of the bay shore , would prove a sufficient liner . It has n't . With each rotation of the tides , a fresh batch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flushed out into the waters of Biscayne National Park . <p> No funds have been approved to study the effects of this on fish , or measure the potential heavy metal contamination . But a local skipper told me that oddly colored algae covers the bottom of the bay for miles around , rather than the natural marine vegetation . Toxic amounts of ammonia have been measured in nearby bay waters , at a level 1,000 times the natural background levels for seawater . <p> The new cells of Mount Trashmore do have liners , and the leachate is collected in pipes and shipped to a nearby sewage plant . There , it is mixed with treated effluent and injected into caverns 3,200 feet below Florida 's limestone layer . It is not known whether these caverns have outlets to the sea , or up into the limestone aquifer . <p> So this is the situation in the Land of Tomorrow . Too many people in too small a place with too poor of a plan are busily poisoning national parks on both sides of the narrow strip of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows just how widespread groundwater pollution is in South Florida  --  but its effects are beginning to wash back in upon humanity . <p> At my old childhood home , water once gushed out sweet and clear from a well punched 40 feet down into the limestone aquifer . Now it comes out burdened with an unpleasant smell , oily taste and rusty color . <p> And out in the Everglades , and other swamp preserves to the north , the last Florida panthers  --  probably fewer than 30  --  wander through the twilight of their species . Tests on captured males show 90 percent of their sperm cells are deformed by inbreeding and exposure to toxins . In their position at the peak of the wild food chain , the big cats reap concentrated elements collected by other life forms . Once the panthers ' diet was high in Florida deer , but as the deer have declined , the panthers eat more raccoons  --  which correspondingly eat more of the fish and mollusks that quickly pick up the mercury that falls with the rain . <p> " Mercury poisoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their highly tuned nervous systems is what makes these cats successful hunters , " says David Hitzig , director of the Wildlife Rehabilitation and Environmental Education Center in Miami . " So the mercury pollution , even if it does n't directly cause death , can be implicated even in something apparently unrelated , like a panther being hit by a car while it 's trying to cross the Tamiami Trail or Alligator Alley . " <p> Here in California , the mountain lions at the top of our wild food chain are apparently doing well  --  the state Department of Fish and Game estimates there are more than 5,000  --  well enough for some game managers and hunters to think of reopening a season on the big cats . But we do n't have to . The lions are already threatened by something far more effective than guns . <p> Just let our state 's population leap up by another 13 million ( as is projected by the year 2020 ) , and all our environmental rules and regulations could tear under the strain like a tissue of faint hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our state every day  --  in addition to the new humans born here  --  should soon do quite an effective job of putting pressure on the cougar population , first by eliminating habitat , next by eliminating food supply , last by poisoning what remains . You could call this the Florida Plan for managing wildlife . <p> In the face of these surges of growth , projects are afoot to calibrate California 's land use , growth patterns and the measures needed to maintain environmental health . One is the San Francisco Estuary Project , spearheaded by the Environmental Protection Agency , which has studied all impacts on the bay 's health , and will soon release recommendations on the measures that must be taken for the bay 's survival . <p> Some governmental bodies have perceived that preserving bio-regions is the best way to anticipate and solve the problems facing individual threatened species . Examples are the Interagency Council on Growth Management , established by Governor Wilson 's executive order , and the state Resources Agency 's " bio-regionalism " project . Another local harbinger is the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political bodies and conservationists and co-sponsored by the Greenbelt Alliance . <p> In regions that can no longer sustain it , population growth must be curtailed . In regions where human activity is inimical to long-term environmental health , that activity must be transformed . The consequences of not doing so are all too clear out on the southern end of the Florida peninsula , where human society has begun to flounder in its own waste . <p> What the Florida state concurrency laws lack is precisely what the California growth policies do n't yet have : a system of ecological triggers , backed up by legal sanctions with teeth . So when an indicator species  --  striped bass or cougars , steelhead trout or deer  --  drops to a certain level , growth stops . Or when a contaminant level is breached in a water supply , growth stops . We need a system of firm controls founded in the knowledge that a sound environmental infrastructure is what is most basic to our survival . Lacking that , we stand a good chance of being overwhelmed by our mistakes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totem animal of our endeavor the Florida panther  --  a small , smoke-colored cougar with outsized paws , green eyes and a kink in its tail , taking its last faltering footsteps through its tortured world .
