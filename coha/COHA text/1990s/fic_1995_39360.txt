At the Beach <p> I want to knock on everyone 's door , ask for I do n't know who and look at the poor ... <p>  --  Cesar Vallejo <p> The cliff slanted down toward the still steel-gray sound . It was an early spring day , and a cold transparent light seemed to rustle through the beach 's pale-yellow straw and scattered patches of lime grass . The hollows stared emptily up at the sparkling sky , lifeless , indifferent , without the crowds and the shrill carefree shouts of the children who had filled them with life and happiness throughout the summer . A light breeze along the water 's edge touched Martin 's face . He sat on a stone part way out in the low rippling water . <p> He had stayed in bed until almost eleven . There was no one to get him up . After the mail had come with the newspaper and a few bills , he lay for nearly three hours , fighting with a couple of spring flies that , with great zeal , explored his chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he wondered why he was lying there . He did n't succeed in killing the flies , no matter how he tried or cursed . <p> Finally , he dragged himself from beneath the covers , skipped his bath-all this hygiene , he thought for a brief moment . Then he poured a glass of milk and stared out the kitchen window while he drank it . He fell into a kind of trance . It occurred to him that he almost wished someone would show up , either out on the street or at the door . When he had made certain that the leaves of the trees and the jagged branches of the bushes were without irregularities , and the silence was ticking in the kitchen clock , he put on his raincoat and went quickly and purposefully down the rutted road to the beach . Alice and the children were on a short vacation with her parents . <p> What irritated him most was their mutually impoverished communication . They both said the same thing so often and in so many different ways , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , so colorless , that even the sound of simple threadbare words almost wounded him . She was so simple , so direct , so open and frank . She was not offended by their impoverished language , no , she used it without a care . His weariness did not have any effect on her . At times he would literally feel nauseated by her arrangements , her programmed viewpoints and considered approaches , her quotidian strategies . Irritation coursed through him . No , no , he was n't irritated , he was sad , but felt too lifeless and apathetic to do anything about it . And he was the one who had always wanted their relationship to be something special . Was it depression ? he often asked himself , with a glimmer of satisfaction . Depression was , anyway , always something ... special . <p> Far out on the sound , the vague contours of a ship appeared . If you stare intensely at a distant object for a long time , it becomes clearer even if it comes no closer . Martin continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could glimpse a conical plume of smoke from the stack . <p> He had worked late on his essay about Cesar Vallejo . Deep into his analysis , he grew restless , all at once , and could get no further . The block was caused by a photograph of the poet on the promenade in Nice . <p> Sometimes random , banal snapshots can stir up unusual , violent impressions . <p> There sat this in every manner expatriate poet from an obscure Peruvian Indian village in the strong sunshine one Sunday morning on the promenade in Nice . All alone on a bench . Amid a swarm of people and activity on one of Europe 's most fashionable strips . There he sat . In a suit , black boots , tie and tie pin , a handkerchief in his breast pocket . An immaculate pharmacist enjoying a quiet Sunday morning among his customers . <p> No one special , an anonymous man among so many anonymous people . No , the hooked nose , the gaze betrayed him . Martin saw that at once . A disguised wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place here in the sun . Patchwork rags , dressed in the latest pain and dissimulation , to make himself invulnerable against the pity and condescension of the mob . To be allowed to let the sun caress his face and hands even if the stink of the clothes filled his nose and diluted his grief . Cesar Vallejo on a bench in Nice , a will-o ' - the- wisp in the carefree crowd , an impassioned lover of Spain far from the hopeless battlefields there , sitting disillusioned , gripped by inner rage and mad visions , on a bench in Nice in 1937 , sick with heartache and poverty . Martin was completely taken by his own idea of Cesar Vallejo 's great , almost poetic loneliness . And it occurred to him that his readers were utterly indifferent to it . They were after an intellectual joyride , a well-turned article about one of Latin America 's great lyric poets . The hell with the readers . Suddenly , the most important thing in the world for Martin was to be able to write , to dare to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical science . One was called Spain , the other  --  a very old , very honorable disease for which there were no anodynes-was hunger . On Good Friday 1938 Cesar Vallejo died of starvation in a gray hospital room in Paris . <p> The hell with it all ! Martin felt the depression grow inside him . He could just see the pitying gazes of his colleagues , students , readers , friends , when they read that . God , him too ! Embarrassing , intellectually embarrassing ! The barricades mounter as a tearjerker , the spearhead researcher as a petit bourgeois corrupter of taste . Aha , so Martin has deserted , now he probably takes long , sensitive walks along the beach by his house too . And whatever else they might think up . <p> The ship had come closer while Martin ransacked his heart . <p> The plume of smoke was thicker , the white side of the ship lit up by the sun . Martin turned his collar up , stood , strolled down the beach . It was perfectly clear to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a " crisis . " He shivered at the word . His specialty at parties had always been sarcastic cracks about " crisis " mongers , prophets of pessimism , doomsday moralists . And now he saw his own dissimulations reaching their limits . <p> For years he had constructed an image  --  God , he believed it himself  --  the whole schtick about engagement , analysis , the alternative . The great beast of the Apocalypse : the alternative . In the eyes of others he was the guide , the light in the darkness , the guru . But his experiences of life with Alice and the children had punched increasingly large holes in that idea . At home , his ideals were giving way , and little by little his whole life . Their life , Alice would suggest when he was in this mood . <p> He protested once , too , stood on the barricades , demanded freedom of research . He did n't attain his present position by sitting on his backside . The engagement ( a word he had trouble with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job as a university lecturer . He did n't betray the cause as so many others had . But now he was a lonely man of forty-five , with reservations , thin strands of hair brushed across his balding pate , with trouble sleeping . <p> He picked a stone up from the beach and pitched it far out on the water . A botch , all of it . All these good heads with their itch to write , fantasizing the world into nothing but ideas , odorless words , split hairs . Eggheads . Yes , an egghead is what he had been . Never allowing feelings to break through , punch big holes in the air around you . Never bad manners , never ill-considered stupidity , nothing with chance mediocrity , no spontaneity . Dammit , when was the last time he burst out laughing , choked with laughter ? And when had he last amused someone else , said something that really stopped the show ? No , this freedom and rebellion would fit into a very small space , a sadly fenced-off plot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , he was so carried away by the sarcasm that was growing in him and turning into words , words , words . He suddenly discovered that his feet were wet ; he was standing in the water . He hopped back to dry land again , walked more quickly toward the point , a few hundred yards farther on . The ship was so close now that he could read the name on its prow : M/S Alicante . <p> The view down over the harbor and the city from the high hills out toward the sea to the south was so lovely . Miguel and Andres knew it inside and out , they had played up there as children , fished from the beach below the point and taken evening strolls with their sweethearts as shy young men . They had also played with the two civilgardists , Juan and Pedro , long ago . Later , their pahs diverged . When the Republic was declared , Miguel and Andres knew where their place was ; it was the people 's Spain , and the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan and Pedro got their lacquered hats , and one morning at the end of July 1937 it fell to their lot to cycle out to the point to pick up their two former playmates . And now they stood here up on the cliff south of the city , all four of them , and had a new game to finish . Juan indicated with a languid movement of his hand that the two fishermen should turn and look down over the harbor and the city . That was not necessary , they preferred to look that way anyhow , so they did not have to Eook their two childhood friends in the eye . Andres cast a brief glance back over his shoulder and saw the two civilgardists apathetically remove their lacquered hats and lay them in the grass . <p> Then they took their carbines and moved slowly over to Miguel and Andres . With a couple of lazy little pokes in the back , Pedra had them move all the way out to the edge . Below , the waves broke against the boulder , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home . Miguel took Andre 's hand , and standing this way , they looked down over Alicante for the East time , and shots sounded out in the quiet morning . <p> Martin moved more quickly . He felt a sudden urge to get as close to the ship as possible . Maybe he could see people , a sailor out to get a breath of fresh air or someone painting the windlass , a cabin door , a lantern . Just something . Something moving , maybe someone who would catch sight of him . When , breathless , he got out to the tip of the point , he sat down on a rock and waited . He waited for the ship to come closer , to pass by close to him . <p> The ship ploughed past , out in the water . There was n't a sound . Not an eye to see . The white prow just glided silently , enigmatically through the waves . " A ghost ship , " flashed through Martin 's mind . " Crap , " he hissed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheated . Then he looked again out at the white prow sailing away , and felt suddenly like a schoolboy who runs down to the harbor to see a foreign ship sailing in . When he turned around and looked in over the lightly rolling landscape , he remembered the children 's faces in the background . And their eagerly waving hands while they pulled out of the driveway . <p> A great restlessness came over him . He wandered aimlessly through the pale grass and the stunted bushes . He did n't follow the path but walked in curves , making wide arcs , all in all behaving like someone who had gone a little odd . A worn-out man , alone with the confused sorrows he had rejected on the surface . A lonesome wanderer among wife and children , colleagues and students . A dreamer in tailored clothes locked into his own ideas about the house in the country and a primitive bid for love of the exciting kind . An easy rider lured into the stupefying trap of affluence , with a mentality like a baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he staggered around in the dark . <p> The children 's faces in the background , their small dewy puppy eyes , Alice , Alice , your body , satanic exhibition of thigh and ass and breasts , which tore him from his writing time and again . Alice , your animal generosity , your freedom , your outright lechery , Alice , Alice , my bitch , my castle in the sky , my whore , my crying pillow , my great , great love  --  Martin was about to stumble  --  Catalonia ' s heroic fight to the death , the Falangists ' murders in Alicante , Vallejo 's loneliness , his longing to die in battle , in hand-to-hand combat , the godforsaken wolf on the bench , the foolish man on the beach , alone and beside himself for that one reason , as if it would help to have the reasons brought out , goddamn it all , all that bungling with life , the university work with Spanish literature , Civil War romance , the failed and misunderstood revolt , the well-paid opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and that pious , right-minded refrain : " Pull yourself together , Martin ! Get your feet on the ground , Martin ! " <p> " Alice , Alice , where are you ? " he heard all around him . He spun round and round but saw nothing . " Martin , Martin , where are you ? " he heard her call . He ran , confused , here and there , but could n't see anyone . Then he tripped over a stone and fell flat on his face . In a moment , he came to and still heard something , but it was only the wind . <p> When he came around the blackberry bush , he saw someone sitting on the veranda . " What the hell ? " he wondered , " Who could that be ? " He could see it was a man . As he came closer , he saw that the man was immaculately dressed , practically in his Sunday best ; " like a pharmacist " were the words that flashed through his mind . What garbage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ... there was something about him that reminded Martin of ... " Nonsense ! " he said to himself . But he was becoming uncertain . Why was that stranger sitting there on his veranda , on the bench , staring out over the water ? And that gaze . So piercing and at the same time empty . Strange , he thought , but he stepped decisively up to the man to introduce himself . <p> The stranger turned his hollow eyes at Martin . " I would like to speak with you , Martin , " he said . <p> " Okay . Do we know each other ? " <p> " We 've known each other for many years , but whether you know who I am , well , that 's open to question . " <p> " Exactly who are you ? " <p> " Why not let that wait until later ? I 've come to take care of an old matter . " <p> Martin thought his voice sounded odd , as though he had trouble getting his breath . " What matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come to help you out of a jam , to say it right out . " <p> " I do n't need any help , thanks just the same . Listen , what the hell do you think ... " <p> " Okay , okay , take it easy . You 'll see , everything will work out . Listen carefully , Martin : we 've known each other for a long time , but we lost sight of each other many years ago . In the old days , while we were at school together , we were almost always together , you must remember that . We have the same name . There , you see ? " <p> " I do n't see a goddamn thing . Get to the point . " <p> " I will . I studied Spanish , did well , graduated , traveled to Spain . Because I wanted to but also because of an unhappy love affair . No , the hell with that . I went to Spain and traveled around there for a few years , I lived here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? And so what ? " <p> " Well , I met a lot of strange people along the way , and was , as you well remember , preoccupied with the Civil War , so I found myself with a number of poor fellows who had been victims of the fascists ' treatment of the losers and were now practically vagabonds in their own country . There were many good people there among them , as you can imagine , old militia soldiers and ... " <p> " Yes , and so what ? " <p> " Well , I was homeless myself , but I have a good memory and think I know something about that Civil War . Some years ago , I read your book about it . It was a big success with the students in the sixties , was n't it ? " <p> " Yes , but ... " <p> " Martin , I 've looked for you for a long time because I wanted to see you and tell you that I read your book with pleasure , even if I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguous , but that 's because ... " <p> " What kind of rubbish is this ? I 'm not interested in discussing this with someone like ... " <p> " I figured as much . But actually I came here for another reason . " <p> " And what is that ? " <p> " How is Alice ? " <p> Martin started , nearly fell . " Alice ? What ... ? <p> " Yes , how is she ? " <p> " What the hell ... ? " <p> " Martin do n't get so excited . I 'm only asking how your wife is . " <p> " Where do you know her from ? " <p> " From long ago , Martin . She was the one who got me to travel to Spain . That was before you met her . " <p> Martin approached the man . He wanted to knock him off the bench . Chase him away . Be done with him . But the man in his Sunday clothes suddenly stood up , turned his empty eyes toward Martin for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing smile , and began to walk off through the garden . Martin stared after him . He did n't so much as turn back ; he was just a black suit wandering slowly out of Martin 's garden , off his property . <p> Martin stood there , motionless . What the hell was that all about ? Who was the man ? Did he know Alice ? He knew Spain and the Civil War ? And came here to ask how Alice was ... or ? No . The hell with it ! He shook his head , tried to pull himself together . He did not want to be confronted with his past too , especially not now . <p> Perplexed , Martin went in through the garden door but could not prevent himself from glancing out the window after the man . He was almost down to the water now . Martin could just make out the black shape wandering through the pale grass and stunted bushes . Let him go , Martin thought , but he remained standing until he could no longer see the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bench o the promenade at Nice staring out over the Mediterranean contains in all its simplicity much more of the fatal homelessness reflected in his poems than all the ethnographic and political shibboleths that have been employed to describe the Peruvian poet 's circumstances and fate . The lonely Indian among chattering petit bourgeois Frenchmen and fashionable European tourists affords an image of humanity 's fundamental loneliness ... <p> Martin paused , numbed by the hammering of the typewriter keys , and read the last sentence again . Was n't this an apostasy from everything he had up to now stood for ... a picture of humanity 's fundamental loneliness ... were n't these just the usual phrases , flowery and empty ... and what was worse , in all their flowery emptiness capable of captivating the mob ? He got up and wandered back and forth in his study , which faced the sea . The desk lamp gave the room a soft , reddish tinge , made of it a refuge , a secure harbor against the night 's darkness gathering at the windows . Suddenly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martin . " <p> The unexpected words made him start , as if they came from out in the dark garden , out of the faint monotonous whispering that wrapped the house in a kind of expectation , the sea , the rustling of the wind , all the small sounds of nature , the night 's countless warnings . <p> He went to the window , pressed his nose against the pane , staring out . Far below he could make out a light stripe , the pale yellow sand , and farther out now and then shimmers of light , the sea reflecting the stars . He stared hard at the darkness and the dull gleam of the beach for a long time with increasing anxiety . What was it he saw ? No , it was n't possible . But there was something down there , a dark point that grew and grew and little by little took on a human form . Like someone who stood staring out over the sea down there . Come on , Martin . Of course there is n't anyone standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Martin pulled the curtains over all the windows and sat back down at the typewriter . As in a daze , his eyes saw what his hands were making the machine write : <p> Martin Andersen sits in his self-chosen prison and longs for Alice and his children and Miguel and Andres and Cesar Vallejo and the Spanish Civil War and can no longer do anything about it . And he has just seen death ... <p> His fingers died on the keys . Martin sat staring at the words and the paper lost in thought for a long time . Then he whispered , almost inaudibly , " I can try , Alice . I can try . " <p> It was early morning ; a pale red light suffused the thin curtain in front of the garden door , the first birds were beginning to sing . She lay naked beside him . her black hairflowing out over the pillow , breasts flattened out to the sides , the fine hair of her belly moving slightly when she breathed on them . With one hand he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labia protruding slightly . He slid two fingers along them , his eyes fixed on the open vagina , the round alluring cues of the thigh . He could feel how his prick rose in jerks to stand up large and stiff in the air . Lechery worked through him and only an act of will kept him from lying over her and driving his prick in between the wet labes .... But suddenly she opened her eyes , stared questioningly at him . Then she lifted his hand away , turned on her side , said , " No , Martin , not now , not again . " <p> Martin woke with a start , slouched over the typewriter . He rubbed his eyes in confusion . A pale red glow suffused the curtains , the first light of morning . He could hear the first birds outside . He told himself to go to bed and get some sleep , looked at his watch . Six . Damn , he thought , picturing the day to come , a bad head , stiff limbs , sour stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio . " Romantics , shit , self-absorbed romantics , " he muttered . <p> ... police violence . In Brixton there were also violent disturbances , with incidents of arson and looting . Large gangs of young unemployed black clashed throughout the night with the police who had to employ tear gas and water cannons to clear the streets . Plastic bullets are said to have been used in some instances . The British government ... <p> He snapped the radio off . Violence , misery , police brutality . the usual . Civil war in England , that 's just what it was . Despite the roundabout political jargon . But it had to come , there was a built-in logic in the self-contradicting system . A catastrophic logic . How often had Martin analyzed this kind of thing , with how many different student classes ? But he did n't feel like listening to it , could n't take it anymore . Chaos was on the way no matter what . Old , half-sick men fighting to uphold their injustices . Men his own age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentality of infants who distorted reality to keep it in check . Were their wives leaving them , too ? Were they lonely , too ? Did they sit on a bench on Sundays , too , staring emptily out over the water ? Would they also have preferred to fight in the trenches , the jungles , the mountains , on the streets of the cities ? Were they also images of humanity 's fundamental emptiness ? Or ... <p> With an act of will , Martin drew himself free of all the loose ends and went to take a cold shower . Under the stream of water , he thought of Vallejo 's lines , " ... I come to see you pass by each day , you little enchanting steamship , always at a distance ... " He knew the whole poem by heart , and standing there in the bathroom , he recited it loudly , word for word . Afterward , as he toweled himself dry , he felt better . And when he lay in bed , he fell quickly into a deep sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house when two flat headlights stole up the driveway . Behind the car 's windshield flashed an image of her black hair and two pair of eager young eyes . <p> Translated by Thomas E.
