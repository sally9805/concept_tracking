Section : success stories <p> The lowdown on the life of a portrait painter is this : There 's money to be made  --  people want portraits of immediate family members , and universities , corporations , and associations seek likenesses of their leaders  --  but there is little fame to be gained in this line of work . Add to this the fact that the most famous portrait painters of the last fifty years gained recognition only for works that were rejected by their patrons . For instance , Peter Hurd , Andrew Wyeth 's brother , painted President Lyndon Johnson 's portrait , end Johnson 's reaction was , " The ugliest thing I ever saw " ; and Graham Sutherland painted a portrait of Winston Churchill , which was destroyed by the Prime Minister 's wife , who managed to be more incensed by it than her husband Californian Don Bachardy gained national attention when his official portrait of former governor Jerry Brown was denounced by state legislators . Perhaps these rejections were actually a sign of the artists ' talent and insight , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward . <p> Of course , certain artists who have done portraits are also famous . Edgar Degas , better known for his Impressionistic ballet dancers , and John Singer Sargent , who also did watercolor landscapes , both used portraiture as a way to earn some badly needed money ( with Sargent it also gained him a reputation and entree into the fashionable society he coveted ) . The sculptor Isamu Noguchi made bronze busts and head figures of paying clients , although he is best known for hid large , abstract pieces . Of contemporary artists , Will garnet , David Hockney , Alex Katz , Alfred Leslie , and Philip Pearlstein are among the many who have been induced to do a portrait when the money and sitter were right . <p> The issue seems to be whether one is known as a portrait painter or as an artist who also happens to do portraits . Aaron Schickler , for instance , who is best known for his portrait of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy , eschews the portrait-painter label , noting , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am an artist . " Everett Raymond Kinstler , who did President Gerald Ford 's official portrait as well as those of many other political leaders , also skirts the issue by claiming he 's " an easel painter . " For most artists who do portraiture , it is a sideline that pays the bills until their other paintings start selling . " It 's a marvelous opportunity to sharpen one 's drawing skills , " Will Barnet says , " and it 's a real challenge to capture someone on canvas . " <p> For others , it is a full-time occupation that may involve not only people but houses or pets as subjects , with final works created in a variety of mediums , including those involving drawing , painting , photography , and sculpture . Many of these artists work through one of the many specialty galleries catering to portrait commissions such as Portraits , Inc . ( New York City ) , Portrait Brokers ( Birmingham , Alabama ) , Portraits Chicago , Portrait Representatives ( Washington , DC ) , and Portraits South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonrefundable forty-percent deposit from the client in the event that the work is rejected . Forty percent is also the customary amount of their commission , so the deposit ensures that the galleries lose nothing . Regular art galleries handling the work of figurative artists also arrange portrait commissions . Prices in most cases are set by the artist . <p> Artists working independently generally require a **25;33;TOOLONG nonrefundable deposit . Other costs are negotiated with the client separately . These costs may include travel the subject ( which may consist of accommodations , food , and the cost of renting a studio in another city ) , framing , shipping , and the medium itself ( bronze , pastel , and oil paint are the most common for portraiture ) , and may also be based on the number of figures in the picture ( a mother and daughter , for instance , or several animals ) , the type of animal or pet ( a horse may cost one amount , a parakeet another ) , the type of background ( for example , Portraits , Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a landscape instead of simply being dark ) , and the amount of the subject included ( head and shoulders , half figure with or without hands , three-quarter length , or full-length ) . <p> Daniel Greene , a pastel portrait artist who has been doing likenesses for the past thirty-five years , says that some artists charge less for painting children than adults since " portraits of children are usually paid for by an individual , such as a parent , whereas an adult portrait may be of the vice president of a corporation and the portrait is being paid for by the corporation . Corporations have more money than individuals , and an artist may charge accordingly . " <p> Greene , who holds portrait workshops around the country , adds that prices artists charge for portraits range from $250 to $75,000 , with the average being between $400 and $7,500 . The more prestigious commissions and the higher prices tend to come to artists with reputations ; many artists find that word of mouth brings them most of their clients . <p> The fees for painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for individuals or animals , largely because of the way these house portraits are conceived or used . Interior decorators , landscapers , or architects , for example , may commission an artist to paint a customer 's house as an example of the work they 've done on it , but they are unlikely to pay thousands of dollars for this . Homeowners who want a painting of their property may pay somewhat more . Portraits of people , on the other hand , usually cost more because they are intended to be lasting memorials . <p> Dena and Stewart Stewart of Miami Beach , Florida , who specialize in home-interior murals and portraits of houses , find that Christmas is their busiest time . Their prices are $385 ( 11 " x 14 " ) , $485 ( 16 " x 20 " ) , and $585 ( 18 " x 24 " ) . They create designs , in their folk-art style , based on photographs that customers send . <p> Prices for portraits  --  either of humans , pets , or houses  --  are not likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dealer since artists are unlikely to undercut their galleries , which would damage artist-dealer relations . In addition , independent portrait painters are quite happy to keep the extra forty percent for themselves . <p> Every artist works differently on portraits , some staying in their studios and relying on photographs that a patron sends them and some insisting on visits in order to sketch ( and possibly photograph ) the subject . Ariane Beigneux of Norwalk , Connecticut , who specializes in portraits of children , notes , " I make a careful color sketch from life  --  the child has to sit for a few hours  --  and then I take maybe sixty photographs from different angles to capture expressions ; and poses . That gives me a lot of different attitudes and choices . " On the other hand , Ellida Sutton Freyer of Chicago , who frequently depicts pets , takes a booth at an art fair or dog show to make quick sketches of animals and occasionally travels to someone 's house to make a sketch . " But , " she confesses , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose . It can be difficult following a cat all over the house . " Margaret Holland Sargent , a Los Angeles-based painter who created a series of instructional videotapes on portrait painting takes a series of photographs of her clients in various settings , wearing different clothing , and with differing expressions , which she then shows to them in an effort to decide upon the best possible pose . <p> As with everything else , portrait painting is influenced by changing styles ; sometimes it leans toward photographic realism while at other times it displays a looser style . Clients generally have a sense of what they are paying for since either the artist or the gallery will have a brochure of previously painted portraits that indicate what subjects the artist does and what style he or she uses . But despite this , sometimes the client is shocked by the completed work . " I 've had problems with paintings that , eventually I had to redo , " Everett Raymond Kinstler says . " I did one of Kurt Waldheim , the former United Nations Secretary General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my interpretation of him , and he made some recommendations . I could see his point of view , but I could not , in my artistic sensibility , accept the changes he recommended . However , I did agree to do the painting over again . He ended up liking the second one . " <p> Daniel Greene suggests that artists show the work to the client during its progress since , he notes , " customers like to see the work develop from white canvas to full-color painting . " Showing the work during its progress also keeps the final painting from coming as a shock when the subject finally sees it . " It may be a good shock or a bad shock , " says Greene , " but it is always a shock . Many artists drape the work when the subject is n't posing , or turn it toward the wall , and all the sitter gets to see before the final viewing is the back of the canvas . But when a subject gets to see the work during its progress , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . " Will Barnet says , " The reason I never wanted to do portraits as my full-time occupation is that I do n't want to work under anyone 's judgment . I would n't want someone to tell me to make the nose a little different . " <p> By the way , it is noses and ears that many portrait painters claim are the largest area of dispute . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Margaret Holland Sargent with her painting At Battle Monument , 1990 , oil , 46 x 58 , collection the United States Military Academy at West Point Museum .
