The elegant embroidered composition illustrated in Plate I , probably made in celebration of a betrothal , displays the skill of a professional designer and the competence of a practiced embroiderer 's hand . The setting for the lovers ' rendezvous is the back of a balconied country house , whose guests look out on and walk through a pleasure garden with beds planted in knot designs , an orchard , vine-covered alleyways , and a heath beyond . These pleasure gardens were considered extensions of the public areas of the house . The activities of villagers-a shepherd with his flock , a stag hunt with dogs , and carts going to a neighboring town-are portrayed in the background . A unique aspect of this picture is that it is an accurate record of what an English country house garden looked like in the first half of the seventeenth century . It is an important document since so few gardens from this period have survived the whims of fashion , economy , successive owners , and generations of gardeners ' hands .

And indeed it is the purest of human pleasures . It is the greatest refreshment of the spirits of man . " 1 A favorite with embroiderers of all ages , gardens figure as verdant backdrops for realistic scenes , such as the intimate party illustrated in Plate II . More frequently they provide lush colorful scenery for the Old Testament and allegorical stories that were so frequently the subject of needlework at the time . What appear to the modern eye to be peculiar or purely imaginary elements in embroidered gardens ( see Pls . III , IV ) had counterparts in actual English gardens of the period , as the following examples illustrate . The title page of a popular early seventeenth-century embroidery pattern book features an engraving of a small pleasure garden-similar to the knot gardens in Plate I-surrounded by a trelliswork fence ( Fig. 2 ) . The beds hold only a few plants . Beginning in the sixteenth century , new plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New World . The sixteenthcentury historian William Harrison ( 1534-1593 ) thought this worthy of note in his Description of England : It is a world ... to see how many strange herbs , plants , and annual fruits are daily brought unto us from the Indies , Americas , Taprobane Sri Lanka , Canary Isles , and all parts of the world.2 These florae were usually grown as curiosities . Prevailing fashion dictated that the exotic flowers and plants be set off singly , not massed together as in modern gardens . So in embroideries , as well as other decorative arts of the period which illustrate gardens , flowering plants are displayed singly in a bed , in a pot , or on a small molehill-sized mound , similar to the mounds visible in Plate I. Flowerpots without plants in them were also prized for their decorative qualities : Other ancient Ornaments of a Garden are Flower-pots , which painted white and placed on Pedestals , either on the ground in a streight line on the edges of your Walks , or on your Walls , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An element common to pictorial embroideries is a fanciful tree on which grows a variety of fruits or a tree whose fruits are a variety of colors ( see PI . Ib ) . Harrison 's Description offers an explanation for this seemingly whimsical motif : We have in lie sort such workmen as are not only excellent in grafting the natural fruits but also in their artificial mixtures , whereby one tree bringeth forth sundry fruits or on the same , fruit of diverse colors and tastes , dallying as it were with Nature and her course.4 An embroidered image related to the " tree of many fruits " is the " vine of many flowers , " which often arches over an allegorical character , as in the needlework in Plate III . This curved floral doorway is actually the front view of a garden bower . Thomas Hill ( b. c. 1528 ) provided a clear example of a bower in an engraving included in his Proffitable Arte of Gardening ( Fig. 1 ) . Bowers were constructed of juniper or willow poles , bound together and arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vines , including those of fruits and vegetables , and wound the stems and tendrils around the poles , that the branches of the Vine , Melone , or Cucumber running and spreading all ouer , might se shadow shade a person and keepe both the heat &; sun from the walkers and sitters there under.5 Authors of contemporary gardening books wrote in some detail about the best time to plant . They agreed that the greatest influence on sowing , planting , and grafting was the " fauour or hindreance of the heauens . " Gardeners were urged to observe the celestial bodies : and the more of these you can find at your time of concurring , the better it is : ... in due time of the Moones ages , in due time of her place , in the Zodiacke , in due aspecte of Sum well placed in the sight of Heaven etc.6 Thus , the appearance of both the sun and moon-as well as other bodies of the firmament-in an embroidered sky is not simply a conceit of the pattern drawer An exhibition entitled British Embroidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the DeWitt Wallace Gallery , Colonial Williamsburg Foundation , Williamsburg , Virginia , through September 6 .
