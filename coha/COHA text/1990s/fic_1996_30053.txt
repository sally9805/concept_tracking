The time is eight years after the battle of Endor . Grand Admiral Thrawn and the resurrected Emperor have been defeated and their forces scattered , leaving only bickering warlords to fight over the scraps of Imperial war machinery deep in the Core Systems , far behind enemy lines . The renegade Admiral Daala is believed dead , but with her lone remaining Star Destroyer she has limped back to the shelter of the tattered Empire , where she hopes one day to return to the fight for lost Imperial territory .... On Yavin 4 Luke Skywalker has formed an academy to reestablish the Jedi Knights , former guardians of the Old Republic . He has already taught many students how to use their powers with the Force ; more candidates come , while others decide to go forth and help safeguard the fragile alliance of the New Republic . In recent months Luke has destroyed the automated Dreadnaught , the Eye of Palpatine , and rescued the spirit of the Jedi woman Callista , who was trapped in the Dreadnaught 's computer for decades . Luke has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabits the body of one of his lost students . Though Callista is now alive again and free to love Luke Skywalker , she has inexplicably lost all of her Jedi powers in the ordeal . Luke is desperate to find some way for Callista to get her abilities back . No matter where the search may lead him .... The banthas plodded in single file , leaving only a narrow trail of scuffed footprints across the dunes . Twin suns hammered down on the procession . Waves of heat rippled like cloaking shields , blurring the distance and making an oven of the Dune Sea . Indigenous creatures took shelter in whatever shadow they could find until the firestorm of afternoon trickled away into the cooler dusk . The banthas moved with no noise other than the muffled crunching of their footsteps in the sand . Swathed in strips of cloth , the Tusken Raiders astride the shaggy beasts looked from side to side , keeping watch . Wrapped entirely in bandages , yet still uneasy about the disguise , Han Solo looked out through narrow metal tubes designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a corroded metal filter for the sand ; the filter contained a small internal moisturizer to make Tatooine 's fiery air more breathable . The other Sand People had tiny ventilators studded around their desert coverings . Only their strongest survived to adulthood , and they prided themselves on it . Han rode on his bantha , hoping to remain inconspicuous in the middle of the procession . The hairy beast swayed as it walked , and Ha tried not to clutch its scalloped , curving horns more often than the other Tusken Raiders did . The bantha 's sharp back ridges were covered with matted fur , and the disconcertingly thin saddle made the ride excruciatingly uncomfortable . Han swallowed , taking another sip of his precious water and biting back a complaint . This had , after all , been his own crazy suggestion . He just had n't expected Luke Skywalker would be so eager to agree , and now Han was stuck . The mission was vital to the New Republic , and he had to follow through . With a muttered command , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession trudged through fine sand , winding along the crest of a shifting dune that stood like a towering sentinel in the arid ocean . Han did not grasp the dune 's great size until they had ascended for the better part of an hour without reaching the top . The suns grew even hotter , if that were possible . The banthas coughed and snorted , but the Sand People were focused on a mission . Han swallowed , trying to ease his parched throat . Finally , he could remain silent no longer and whispered into the short-range transmitter implanted in his breathmask . " Luke , what 's goin ' on ? " he said . " I 've got a bad feeling about whatever they 're up to . " It took Luke Skywalker a moment to respond . Han watched the thin rider two banthas ahead of him sit up straighter ; Luke seemed far more comfortable in his disguise than Han felt . Of course , Luke had grown up on Tatooine  --  but the young man 's voice now sounded bone weary as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing to do with us , Han , " he said . " A few of the Sand People have vague suspicions , but they have n't centered on us yet . I 'm using the Force to distract anyone who pays too much attention . No , this is something different entirely . A great tragedy ... you 'll see . " Luke heaved a long breath through his breathmask . " Ca n't talk now . Have to concentrate . Wait until they 're preoccupied , and I 'll explain more . " Up ahead , Luke slumped forward in his Tusken disguise . Han knew his friend was expending an incredible amount of energy to lull the Sand People into ignoring their two unwanted guests . Luke was able to use his abilities to muddle the minds of weak individuals , but never before had Han seen his friend manipulate so many minds at once . The trick was to keep the Sand People from noticing them ; then it was easy for Luke to divert a few stray thoughts . If someone sounded an alarm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even a Jedi Master would be able to keep up the charade . Then there would be a fight . Tucked under his tattered robes , Han carried his trusty blaster pistol . He did n't know if he and Luke could take on the entire band of raiders  --  but they would make a good accounting of themselves if circumstances ever came to that . The lead rider reached the peak of the sand mountain . The bantha 's wide feet trampled the wind-sharpened edge atop the dune . The air was still , as if stunned . The sands glittered like a billion miniature novas . Han adjusted the corroded filters over his eyes . The other banthas plodded up , surrounding their leader , who raised his cloth-wrapped arm , brandishing a wicked-looking gaffi stick . Behind the Tusken leader , his single passenger sat slumped and sullen , though it was difficult to understand the body language of these masked and alien people . Han sensed somehow that this withdrawn passenger was the center of the ceremony . Was some kind of honor being bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tribe ? The passenger slid off the lead bantha , letting himself drop from the shaggy beast . He clung to the woolly fur as if in desperation , but no sounds came from his bandaged face , not even the guttural grunts and snorts the Tuskens used as language . Head down , his eye tubes pointed toward the churned sand where bantha footprints had trampled the pristine dune , the passenger stood dejected in front of the lead rider . The leader waited beside his mount , holding the upraised gafm stick ; the other Sand People climbed down from their banthas . They thrashed their own weapons in the air . Han and Luke copied the gestures , trying to blend in . In his disguise Luke moved slowly and wearily . This mission was taking a heavy toll on the Jedi Knight , and Han hoped they would reach their destination soon . The forlorn passenger hesitated at the edge of the dune , gazing across the sweeping ocean of loose sands that spread to the horizon . The Sand People stood at attention and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of the moment , Luke 's voice buzzed in Han 's ear . " All right , they 're distracted , " he said . " I can explain . The lone Tusken Raider lost his bantha three days ago . A krayt dragon killed it , and unfortunately our friend there got away . " " What do you mean , unfortunately ? " Han mumbled , hoping his voice would n't carry over the restless sounds of the Sand People . " The Tusken Raiders have a very close relationship with their banthas , " Luke said . " It is a mental bonding , a symbiosis , almost like a marriage . They become part of each other , bantha and Tusken . When one member of the pair is killed , the other is incomplete -- like an amputee . " Unconsciously , Luke flexed his cyborg hand . " He has no place in Tusken society though he is more an objea of pity than of hatred . Many believe he should have died beside his bantha , no matter what the circumstances . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Han asked . " Yes and no , " Luke said . " They believe the spirit of the dead bantha must decide . If the spirit wishes for him to bond with another mount , our friend will find a free wild bantha in the desert , join with it , and return in triumph to the tribe , where he will be fully accepted  --  even highly revered . However , if the bantha 's spirit wants his rider to join him in death , then the outcast will wander hopelessly in the desert until he dies . " Han barely shook his head . " Does n't sound like his chances are too hot . " Luke said , " Probably not  --  but that is their way . " The Sand People waited for the exile to make the first move . Finally , with a single anguished cry that might have been triumph or challenge , he plunged down the steep and shifting slope of the dune . The Sand People tilted their heads toward the burning sky and let out a loud ululating cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaffi sticks to wish their companion well . The banthas raised up their squarish , shaggy heads and bellowed in unison , a rumbling , growling cry that shook the Dune Sea . The lone raider waded down the steep slope . Dusty golden sand flew up around him as his feet and legs sank in . His robes flapped behind him as he plodded on . He tripped and tumbled , flailing his arms , and finally jabbed his gaffi stick deep into the uncertain surface , one arm thrust out to gain balance , leaving a swath of disturbed sand behind him . The exiled raider heaved himself to his feet again . Sand trickled from his flowing cloaks , but still he marched ahead , not looking back . A few of the banthas bellowed again . The sound was swallowed up in the empty vastness . The outcast 's drab garments soon made him disappear into the landscape . The lead raider turned and , with a single energetic leap , mounted his bantha . The other Sand People climbed into their saddles . The banthas snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his seat . Luke was the last to balance himself again , and by that time the lead raider had already turned the hairy beast to the side and began to plunge down the shallower slope at the back of the dune . The other Sand People followed , marching closely in line to mask their tracks . Han risked a glance behind him . He could just make out the single exiled raider dwindling in the distance , moving with slow determination as ripples of heat blurred his tiny figure . Soon he was swallowed completely by the unforgiving jaws of the Dune Sea The heat of the day seemed to last forever , and Han rode in a fugue state , barely aware of his surroundings , self-hypnotized by a litany of rocking footfalls . Ahead , Luke continued to sit upright on the bantha saddle , though he wavered from time to time . Han wondered what sort of energy the Jedi Knight was tapping into . The group camped in a thick maze of rocky badlands punctuated by pockmarked stone needles rising out of the windblown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the temperature plummeted . For a while the rocks continued to throb with stored heat , but they quickly cooled . Grunting and chufmng to each other in their baffling language , the Sand People pitched camp . Each knew his or her own duties  --  Han could not tell whether the individual Tuskens were male or female . Luke had said that only assigned mates were able to see each other with faces unwrapped . Two of the younger people encircled a flat area with smaller rocks , and piled bricks of what Han realized must be dried bantha dung , the only fuel source available out in the barrens . Han and Luke moved about , trying to appear busy . The banthas , not corralled or tied in any way , were simply led to a side canyon where they could rest for the night . Other raiders broke out packages of stringy dried meat . Han and Luke took their share and squatted on boulders . Carefully , Han lifted his metal breathmask and jammed a piece of the meat into his mouth . He chewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the jerky palatable enough to swallow . " What is this stuff ? " he muttered into the voice pickup . Luke answered without looking at him . " Dried and salted dewback flank , I believe . " " Tastes like leather , " Han muttered . " It 's more nutritious than leather ... I think , " Luke said . He turned his metal eyetubes toward Han , who could detect no expression on the wrappedup face . Han became disoriented if he swiveled his head too fast while looking through the small holes in the eyetubes . As the Sand People finished their meal , they gathered around the blaze as a tall raider hunched near the brighter part of the fire . From the careful way he moved , the slow placement of limbs  --  not to mention the silent reverence the other Tuskens granted him  --  Han got the impression that this was a very old person . " The storyteller , " Luke 's voice said in his ear . Other raiders brought out long poles and unfurled bright clan banners marked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These must be totems , symbols not seen by the outside world at all . A young , wiry raider sat next to the storyteller . Others came back from their bantha saddles with trophies , visual aids for the story . They held out scraps of rough cloth , a bloodied banner . Han saw battered and cracked stormtrooper helmets like the skulls of fallen enemies ; a luminous milky gem the size of his fist , which Han recognized with a start as a krayt dragon pearl , one of the rarest treasures ever to come from Tatooine . The old man raised up his bandage-wrapped hands and began to speak . The other raiders sat enraptured as stories spilled out in low grunts and barely recognizable sounds that might have been words . Luke translated for Han . " They 're telling of their exploits , how they took an entire stormtrooper regiment many years ago . How they slew a krayt dragon and took the pearls out of its gullet . How they defeated another Tusken clan , slaughtered all their adults and adopted their children into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storyteller finished his tale and squatted lower , gesturing to the young apprentice who glanced around . Two Tusken Raiders stood on either side of the boy , holding their gaffi sticks with the axheads pointing down at the apprentice . The storyteller raised a trembling hand and turned it sideways like a knife blade . The apprentice hesitated for a moment and began to speak slowly . " Now what ? " Han said . Luke answered . " That boy is being trained as the dan 's next storyteller . The Tuskens believe very much in inflexible tradition . Once a story is set down as an oral path , it must remain forever unaltered . This boy has learned the story he is now telling about a raid on a moisture farmer who attempted to bring peace between humans and Jawas and Sand People . " " But why the weapons ? " Han said . " Looks like they 're ready to snuff the poor kid . " " They will , if he makes so much as one mistake . If the boy alters a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Raiders will kill the apprentice immediately . They believe that speaking the stories in any manner other than the way they were originally told is great blasphemy . " Han said , " Not much room for mistakes , is there ? " Luke shook his head . The other Tuskens were concentrating completely on the boy 's speech . " The desert is a hard place , Han . It allows no room for mistakes . The Sand People are a product of that environment . They have harsh ways , but such harshness has been forced upon them . " The boy finished , and the old storyteller raised his other hand in a congratulatory gesture . The young apprentice slumped with trembling relief , and the other Sand People muttered their appreciation . After a while , the fire was banked and began to burn low . The Tusken Raiders settled down for the night . " I 'm going to get some rest , " Han said . " You have n't slept in two days , Luke . Ca n't you wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? " Luke shook his head . " I do n't dare . If I stop monitoring their thoughts , if I release my hold on their minds , they might suddenly realize we 're not supposed to be with them . If somebody sounds an alarm , we 're lost . Besides , a Jedi can go a long time without rest . " " Whatever you say , buddy , " Han said . " We should reach Jabba 's palace by tomorrow , " Luke said with weary hope . " I ca n't wait , " Han said . " I mean , we had so much fun the last time we were there . "
