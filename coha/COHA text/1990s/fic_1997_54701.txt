Let us begin with two islands called Male Island and Female Island . <p>  --  Marco Polo : The Travels Bob Williams , drunk for seven years , surprised his wife by sobering up and opening a candy store in an abandoned boxcar that had sat for years beside the railroad tracks . He got the proper licenses , cleaned the place up , and made all the candy himself , old-fashioned sweets such as fondant , pralines , toffee , buttercreams , and maple fudge . <p> He was handsome again , Brandy saw , for he had shed his gut . His black hair grew in a thick shock past his ears . Nine years they 'd been married , and now Bob was thirty-six and Brandy twenty-six , still her same small-boned , nut-brown self , still barren . Her parents had died of pneumonia the year before , not in winter but in spring , within a week of each other , leaving the blue house that Brandy and Bob had shared with them not just to Brandy but to Bob , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked him . <p> The blue house sat right beside the tracks , close enough to the boxcar that Brandy could see Bob 's every move through its long , open sliding doors . She watched him at night when he worked in the glow of yellow light , stirring vats of chocolate and rolling out almond paste on a marble-top table . For two years now , even before her parents died , she and Bob had slept in separate rooms  --  hers the one they used to share , the room she 'd had as a child and all her life , and Bob in the downstairs den that her father had kept as an office and had yielded to his son-in-law . The room contained a sofa and a cot , but Bob preferred the floor . Once or twice , Brandy had tiptoed to the threshold and found him stretched out on his back , sound asleep , smiling , dressed in the clothes he had worn all day . He had slept so much from the drinking , all the early years of their marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he kept long hours at the candy store , and he was so happy he sang , which she had never known him to do . He sang the old songs he 'd learned as a kid in the elementary school they 'd both attended , though he 'd gone there ten years before her . She heard him sing " Supper on the Grass " and " Bring Me Little Water , Sylvie " and " John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt , " which got on her mind so bad she finally went out to the boxcar and asked him to stop . <p> It was early morning . In her nightgown and bathrobe , she climbed the steps , stuck her head in , and saw him pressing pecans into a pan of fudge , licking a big wooden spoon . <p> " Breakfast , " he said and smiled . <p> " You woke me up , " she said . <p> " It 's time you got up anyway , " he said . " I wish you 'd help me , Brandy . Make the candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held two jobs for a long , long time , when Bob was too drunk to complete the housepainting he 'd contracted for , and now the habit of work was as strong in her as her love for Bob had been when she was sixteen and wild for him . " How do I know this will last ? " she asked now , in the dim morning cool of the boxcar while a mockingbird trilled outside . " The store might fold . You might start drinking again . Why did you stop , Bob ? What turned you off from it ? " <p> " I had enough , " he said . He put the fudge away to cool . " Do you want me to start again ? " <p> " I never knew you had so much willpower , " she said , but she did n't mean it as a compliment . She felt instead that he was keeping secrets from her , that before her very eyes he had changed into somebody else , while she was still stuck in her barren body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . <p> Bob said , " Some fools count the days they 've been sober . I do n't . It just does n't attract me anymore . I can even cook with it and not want any . " <p> " Well , stop singing that damn song . You know the one I mean . " Brandy stumped back to the house . She heard Bob 's laughter behind her , back in the boxcar . She 'd never even known he could make candy or that he wanted to sell anything or that he was planning to start a business of his own . She 'd thought she knew him : a big drunken wreck of the good-looking man she 'd married . Now he was n't the wreck or the bridegroom , either one . Who was this sleek stranger who charmed his customers ? <p> As she reached her house again , the 7:00 A.M. train shot by , steaming and shrieking and churning . People often asked her , " How can you stand to live so close to the tracks ? " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . She went inside and dressed for her job as a school secretary . Her other job , bookkeeping for two churches , she did at home . <p> Wearing all but her shoes , she went to a window and stared out at the Old Hotel . Built ninety years ago , it stood opposite her blue house on the other side of the tracks , a crumbling country tenement now with only one family living there as caretakers , but still as proud as in the days when it was grand . She realized that Bob , who had been obsessed with the Old Hotel for years , had not talked about it recently . At one time he had chronicled its history in scrapbooks , worshipping its creator , a Confederate captain who had died disappointed that the hotel never drew enough guests . Brandy squinted , staring : pigeons roosted on its balconies , and its broken windows sparkled . For a long time the hotel had been her rival , and now Bob was neglecting it . <p> " I do n't have time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoes . She was late  --  she who was never late . <p> All morning at work , typing papers for the principal , she thought about Bob and his newness . Be glad for him , she told herself , it 's what you 've wanted for so long . She remembered being sixteen and in love with him , when all other men and boys had seemed uninteresting , even a little foolish . Now she felt like the biggest fool of all . <p> The truth was , his happiness galled her , and so did his success . For he was successful-customers bought the candy all day long , from the first day he opened the shop . Yet she had supported him for so long that she felt she 'd be angry for a hundred years , whether he worked or not , whether he stayed sober or not . She was still the hardworking , hoarding ant , and he the grasshopper . <p> Hovering beside her desk , the principal said , " I hear they might organize a Chamber of Commerce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 'll be the day , " Brandy said , slamming a drawer shut . She pinched her finger and cried out . The principal stared at her , and she said , " He was a lot more fun when he was drinking . " It was n't true , but it made the principal turn away big-eyed and leave her alone . As she typed , Brandy 's thoughts were all of sabotage ; she would put a rat in Bob 's kettle and call the health inspector . <p> At lunchtime she went home , as she always did . A shock awaited her : she found Bob 's scrapbooks of the Old Hotel tossed out on the scrap heap for burning . She pulled them out and marched to the boxcar . <p> Even before she reached it , she heard him singing : " Come away with me , Lucille , in my merry Oldsmobile . ... " A ditty Brandy remembered from the old school songbooks , and that she 'd never heard Bob sing before . " Automobubbling , you and I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in there with him , some darkhaired beauty named Lucille whom he has found to love , some candymaking stranger that he has known all his life and has rediscovered ; they 'll be making candied violets and planning their future together . She went inside the boxcar . There he was , alone , pulling taffy . When he saw her , he grinned broadly and kept on singing , his pitch deepening . The taffy gleamed purple in the sunlight . <p> Brandy waved the scrapbooks , which were heavy in her hands . " What are you doing ? " she asked . One book fell to the floor and opened to a picture of the Confederate captain hammering stakes into a hayfield , laying out his plans for Glen Alien . Black-and-white grasses swayed frozenly in the whiteness that was the sun of 1868 ; the stake read " Mountain Road . " " How can you throw these out ? " she said . " I thought you loved the Old Hotel . You 've got the most complete record of its history that anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrapbooks if you want to , " said Bob . " I 'm going to make a candy model of the hotel , out of gingerbread and marzipan . " <p> They stood in the sunlit boxcar with the smell of the candy all around them , and Brandy thought : this is a riddle , some question I did n't ask . Why do you sleep downstairs , Bob ? Why do you stay with me at all ? He was an escape artist , she decided , who somehow had gotten out of chains and handcuffs underwater while she was still caught there , struggling . The Old Hotel was where they used to make love long ago , before they were married ; they 'd made love so many times in its abandoned fourth-floor rooms . <p> She took the scrapbooks in her arms and carried them back to the house , where she put them on the upper shelf of the hall closet . An obsession pitched away : what would become of it ? Would she herself catch it , like a softball or a fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf . <p> He was powerful , and not only because he was still young and strong , rejuvenated , and not only because he was her husband who slept downstairs and sang to himself while he made candy . Even if he grew old and sick , he would be powerful in his new way . <p> She stood in front of the closet . She heard the flag snapping lazily on the flagpole all the way down at the post office ; but other than that , how silent it was , her house and Glen Allen all around her . Her parents ' voices still echoed in these rooms somewhere , her parents who were buried behind the Baptist church . Echoed to silence , those voices , but Brandy felt them . She felt her mother sigh : No children , nor will there ever be . <p> Barren : such an old-fashioned word . Yet she did n't want to adopt , to bring into her midst some stranger 's brat , some bad seed , for she felt sure it would be bad , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about that , had n't they ? Memory failed her . Panic spread through her body in a dark flood . <p> Small-boned and nut-brown , she was . Never meant to bear a child . As a little girl , she 'd picked out names for babies she 'd planned to have someday , beautiful names she loved  --  Ambrose and Mary Ellen . <p> Oh Brandy , put the windows down ! came her mother 's voice , but her mother was dead . Do n't you hear the wind rising ? A storm 's coming . And like a mechanical doll , her nut-brown legs joint-popping at the ankles and knees as if she were still growing , she obeyed . <p> She did not confide in anyone . To the outside world , how happy they must seem : a man contented in his work , his wife having him nearby all day . Maybe she was lucky . Bob did n't keep snakes or set the house on fire . <p> After school let out each day , dozens of children paraded into the candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she pinned her hair back and put on an apron that covered all her clothes , though she did n't cook the candy . She helped Bob sell it , so that the picture to the world was complete : a morn-and-pop shop , a young couple making their way in the world . Bob kept his profits in a box Brandy 's mother had owned , a heart-shaped box that was decorated with lovely ridged seashells . <p> The children veered away from Brandy . Their eyes slewed away from hers when she counted change into their hands and wrapped up the sweets . They wanted Bob . <p> " Tell me your dreams , " he said to them , and Brandy at first said , " Do n't  --  do n't do that , Bob , " so sharp he looked up at her , for she said it in her mother 's voice . She feared the parents might misunderstand , might think Bob meant to drag the children 's secrets out and hurt them , might accuse him of putting sugary hands on their little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kids , do n't tell me the dreams everybody has , not the ones about falling or losing your teeth or being naked in a public place . Those old familiar dreams  --  why , they go all the way back to the days of ancient Greece . " He paused , wiping 10-X sugar off the countertop , and the children gazed at him in awe , for their own parents always shooed them away when they told their dreams , and never talked about ancient Greece . Bob said , " I want your strange ones , those and only those . Do n't try to palm off any TV stuff on me . " <p> A child with eyes too big for her face said , " I dreamed I turned into a fire engine , " and Bob cried , " Yeahi " and gave the little girl a cinnamon stick , striped like a barber 's pole , which she stuck between her lips like a cigarette . <p> The children did n't want to talk to Brandy , but old ladies did ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , just as they had since Brandy 's childhood , these sibilant creatures who smelled of dust and lemons and cut crystal . They talked their old talk to Brandy , so that at night their voices rang in her ears and she saw again their open mouths with the tongues dark like parrots ' . To her they quoted their violent old cookbooks : " Kill a hen ! " " Strain the clabber ! " " Mash the bananas with a silver fork . " <p> " Tell my husband , he 's the cook , " Brandy would say , wanting to steer them away from her , their black-clad bodies heavy or desiccated . They cleaved to Brandy , and Bob got the children and their dreams . The old ladies brought recipes for brown-sugar sand dollars ( confections so sweet Brandy thought her teeth would scream ) and told of clocks that chimed only when family members died , and soon Brandy had quit both her jobs to be at the candy store all the time , though her heart beat so fast she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its wind and thunder , soot staining the white desert of her apron and the white , clicking shine of Bob 's laughing teeth . The train going by . ' hearing it ... that was the only time she ever prayed . <p> Her racing heart was new . <p> " Tell me your dreams , " Bob said , and the children did . <p> The old ladies were too old to die . They went to all the funerals in Henrico County ; they had come to those of Brandy 's parents . Brandy 's mother had admired them , had inherited them from her own mother , these elegant crows whose families ( Broaddus , Sheppard , Scott , Christianson ) had been in Glen Allen forever , their fortunes rising and falling , and whose husbands had died so long ago that they had scarcely existed . The old ladies had known Captain Cussons , they claimed ; he had loved them when they were beautiful girls . <p> They fought among themselves about how Captain Cussons had died , Cussons the founder of Glen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever , when he was on a visit to Memphis . " " No , he fell and broke his neck climbing the steps to the east tower , see , look where I 'm pointing . He broke his neck and his niece found him , the niece that went to Paris and was never heard from again . " <p> Bob snapped his head up from dipping candied orange peel in chocolate and said , " The captain died of pneumonia in January 1912 . " <p> " Pneumonia , " said an old lady around the sourballs in her mouth . " A goose just walked over my grave . Pneumonia is what will get me , I know it now . " To Brandy she said , " Your poor mother and father . " <p> Brandy watched and listened , and her thoughts were at once right there and way far away . She thought : the answer to the riddle will be whether or not he comes to me in the night , ever again . Of course she could go to him , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he lay on the floor , wedged between her father 's desk and the rosewood bookcase with carved feet like a vulture 's , feet that had scared her as a child and scared her still . Would she find Bob there , or a lump of fondant dressed in Bob 's clothes , a gingerbread man with cinnamon hearts for eyes ? <p> Around her the talk turned back to sweets . " He can candy anything , " the old ladies said fiercely . " He made candied onions yesterday . Deliciously " The ladies were jubilant these days , raucous even , the sugar running through their veins like sap . Old ladies and children , all day long : Brandy and Bob were never alone . The only thing she could think of to say to him was so awful that she was glad for all the people around , so she did not say it : " I 'm the goose on your grave , Bob . " <p> Screening out the old ladies ' talk , she listened to the children telling Bob their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set a green lion free from a zoo , " and another said , " I was on a roller coaster that crashed , " and another said , " You liel If it crashed in your dream you 'd be dead . " Bob rewarded them with lime and cherry gumdrops , and meringues with silver icing piped around the sides . <p> " It 's a craze , " an old lady said to Brandy about the buying of dreams , her breath sharp with age and licorice , " just like the children have their crazes , thumb-wrestling and such . If he gives away too much of his candy , how 'll you make any money ? " <p> " I wonder about that myself , " Brandy said , but it seemed that the more candy Bob gave away , the more money he made . <p> " Let me see that box , " the old lady said , seizing the shell-covered cashbox . " Why , it 's a sailor 's valentine , " she cried , running her thin hands over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for their sweethearts . This is a very fine one , made so long ago . " <p> She was the oldest of the ladies , so ancient that at birth , she liked to say , she 'd been wrapped in a Confederate flag . She asked Brandy , " Ca n't you picture some sailor on the high seas , gluing these shells on the box to give to the girl he loved ? " <p> " It was my mother 's , " Brandy said , " and her mother 's before that . " <p> " There 's lint among the shells , " the old lady said , and she blew on it so that dust spewed up in bright motes . <p> Summer came , and it was hot as a dream . Brandy decided it was time to do something with her parents ' clothes , but she did n't know what . Her mother 's things did n't fit her , and already her father 's shoes had gone strange , the leather dark and cracked ; Bob 's feet were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . The dresses and coats looked sad hanging deep in the closets , waiting to be taken out and worn into the world again . The house was dusty all over , and the clothes , even hidden away as they were , made Brandy sneeze . <p> She asked the old ladies , " What should I do ? " and they said give everything to the church . So she did . Bob helped her pack up everything in cardboard boxes Brandy brought home from the grocery store , boxes that bore the names of Virginia food companies : Pocahontas tomatoes , Tidewater herring roe , Sauer 's vanilla , Graves Bros. apples . Brandy stuffed her mother 's pocketbooks with the editorials from the Richmond Times-Dispatch and wrapped them in the funnies . Her heart was caving in . It was a hot Sunday afternoon with the smell of honeysuckle coming through the windows and the cicadas singing outside and a few wasps crawling on the pale ceiling of the room where Brandy 's parents had slept . Brandy put on her mother 's plaid winter coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel her mother 's embrace again , in the familiar cloth . So hot it was , in the sunny room , in the plaid , mothballed coat . Sweat and tears mixed on her cheeks . She lowered her head as she packed the coat away . <p> Bob hummed while he helped . He looped her father 's ties around his neck and said , " I 'll keep some of these to remember him by . " Everything else went to the church , where it was given out to people who were poor . <p> Sometimes , in the years that followed , Brandy would see her mother walking ahead of her on the road , but it was only some woman wearing the plaid coat . Brandy would wave as she drove by , and the stranger would wave back  --  her mother 's arm , her mother 's coat , who could say ? <p> And still the train came through , five or six times a day and more at night , the train she could run away on . All those years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ; all the years when she was in school , she had heard it , and it was a summons she understood . She had been its witness forever , had always known she could hop on it and leave . She imagined that it carried the same cargo it had hauled for 150 years-same coal , same lumber , same passengers with their profiles bent toward their books  --  and the crewmen must be the same as in the days of Captain Cussons , ageless engineers flying up and down the rails . If for an instant the train would stop , she might see that the riders wore the styles of a century ago  --  watch chains and black brocade for some , yeoman 's boots and burlap for others  --  and that the sweet , splintery timber came from some virgin forest deep in the Dismal Swamp , that the heaps of anthracite in the coal cars had changed , over time , into black diamonds . She used to make up stories about the train when she was little and could n't sleep , or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle and felt homesick , though her house was only a mile away and the school was friendly . She had wanted to be home in the blue house , smelling the tar and sulfur in the hurricane wind from the train . The train was truth ; it would flatten her to a hot dime on the tracks . <p> So now she told herself : I could just get on it and run away . <p> What to take with her ? What would she want ? A box of Bob 's maple fudge , for which she 'd developed a taste ; the carved claw feet of her father 's bookcase ; all the lilacs from her yard , which bloomed early every spring ; the family of shy , wild cats that came out of the woods at night to eat the scraps she left for them ; the screech owls and whippoorwills she had heard forever ; and the salty well-water that visitors disliked , which her father had been so proud of , which had turned Brandy 's teeth pale maize in childhood and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be so heavy she 'd fail on her leap to catch the train . <p> She thought about this as she sold candy in the boxcar , and she felt the old ladies reading her mind , condemning her . The only way to go would be to leave everything behind . Her own thin self she could manage , her small nut-brown body could make it , jumping and clinging no matter how fast the train hurtled by , hanging on till she blacked out and woke up  --  where ? Far off in a city where she was no one , not herself , not her past , not Brandy at all , anymore . <p> Because of her racing heart , she stopped eating candy . She had not gained weight ; she never did . But her fast heart scared her , and she went to the doctor , who listened to her chest and gave her pills . <p> " You 'll be fine , " he told her . " You do n't have to do anything different . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 've been hoping for the longest time . " <p> " We did tests , did n't we ? " the doctor asked . " A few years ago . We could run some more . " <p> " No , " Brandy said . <p> " You can be happy without a baby , " the doctor said . <p> She was n't thinking about babies the way she used to do . Instead she thought about running away on the train . Driving home with the bottle of pills in her lap , she thought that even in the act of escape , in the headlong triumph of rail-riding , maybe what she would really want would be to come on back . She drove to her house and parked in the yard and swallowed one of the pills in her dry throat . It tasted like a sandy kiss and made her cough . <p> Yet her heart kept racing , though she took the pills twice daily as the doctor had instructed . Her heart was a wild , live thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with the rest of her , so that she pressed her hand over it and breathed slow and deep till the spells passed , as they always did eventually , leaving her weak and flushed and sweaty , laughing at the children who poured out their dreams for Bob : " I dreamed me and my brother were n't nothing but two heads talking in the sand , " a big boy said . <p> Fall came , and with it the mackerel sky Brandy loved , the tightpacked zigzag clouds of early morning , like a fish 's scales . Bob made so much money that he took to keeping it in a sack . At day 's end he 'd empty it on the counter and run his fingers through it , the coins ringing as they hit , the bills floating greenly for a moment , aloft . " Do n't think this is why I run the store , " he told Brandy one evening , when he saw her watching . <p> " You do it for dreams , " she said over her surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pill , swallowing it with a swig of ginger ale . " Bob , " she murmured , and he looked up from the money . She found her voice then and said , " If I die , there 'd be nothing on this earth to show I was ever here . " <p> He came close as she stacked trays of nougat in the refrigerator , but he did not touch her . He stood with his arms folded across his chest , and his gaze was on her now , his mouth straight and still . " What would you like to leave behind ? " he said . <p> " I just feel empty , " she said . " We go on and on together , but we do n't have any children . Say it , Bob , we 're not good together anymore . " <p> " It should be better now , " he said , " now that I 've quit drinking . I do n't think we 'll ever have children , Brandy . We 'll have to live with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you even want to ? " she asked . " Is there any point in it , anymore , now that we have given up ? " <p> " I do want to , " he said , to her surprise , and in silence they closed up the shop and stepped outside . Bob reached up and closed the long sliding door of the boxcar with a clash that echoed into the woods . <p> In bed that night he asked , would it hurt her heart ? <p> " No , " she said and smiled in the darkness . When he turned to her , she had a memory : as a child she had found a bottle of Benedictine in her father 's gun closet and had made a secret snack of it , alternating deep gulps with bites of a chocolate bar . Faster and faster she ate and drank , with the fire and the sweetness in her mouth . <p> Dawn came , and Brandy heard that familiar voice as plainly as if her mother had stepped into the room : Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Bob awoke , Brandy said , " I do n't think I slept at all . " <p> " But you did , " he said . <p> " I was not complaining . " <p> She buried her face in his neck and cried , all the sorrow flowing out of her . Outside , the crows were cawing , and inside , her mother was saying , This is a fine warm house . It has stood so many winters . <p> <p> By CARY HOLLADAY <p>
