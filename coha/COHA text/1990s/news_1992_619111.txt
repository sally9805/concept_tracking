<p> My daughter , Lisa , is different . You ca n't tell from looking at her , but she is in the 1 percent of the population who has schizophrenia . <p> What would happen if people found out ? Would she lose her job , her apartment , her friends ? <p> Mental illness is scary . While most of my friends can brag of offspring who move up corporate ladders or are involved in exciting careers , I am silently grateful that Lisa does n't need to be institutionalized . <p> Was her illness my fault ? I wonder . Did I wean her too early ? Was I too strict ? Too lenient ? Trying to understand what happened , I gave myself a crash course in this mind disorder  --  went to lectures , haunted the library for anything in layman 's language . My discoveries were enlightening . Most experts now agree that the disease is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , that it may be genetically predisposed and that psychotherapy seldom helps . Physician E. Fuller Torrey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layman 's most comprehensive guide , became my bible . <p> What had happened ? <p> Lisa 's childhood seemed normal . Yes , she was an ultra-shy kindergartner , but by her teens she seemed outwardly like any other high school student . After college , she moved to a city 300 miles away . On one of her infrequent visits home , I hugged her , wrapped an arm around her waist . " You 've lost weight , " I commented . <p> " Fifteen pounds , " she grinned , but there was an odd expression in her eyes . <p> That night , I heard her wandering around . " I ca n't seem to sleep anymore , " she complained . <p> " What 's bothering you , hon ? " <p> " It 's those strange people at work coming over and asking me questions I ca n't answer . " What was wrong ? She was bright ; she had two college degrees . I tried to reassure her about her new job , suggested she make up study cards to help with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote dozens of cards and frantically pored over them every free minute . But after she went back she called to report , " The cards are not helping . The boss is sending spies to trip me up . " She seemed so distraught that I suggested she come back to talk to a psychotherapist in our home town . <p> " Classic delusion symptoms , " he said . " Your daughter is a high- functioning paranoid schizophrenic . " His words numbed me ; I felt like I 'd been dropped in an Arctic bath . Had he confused her with another patient ? He could n't be talking about my sweet , gentle child . " Lisa does n't r-r-rave and r-r-rant , " I protested . For the first time in my life I stuttered . Desperate to deny , I went on , " She d-d- does n't have multiple p-p-personalities , is n't v-v-violent . " But he was adamant . His recommendation of anti-psychotic drugs left me stunned . <p> Lisa was lucky . Her disease was diagnosed early , her illness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished her agitation , eliminated the paranoia and allowed her to sleep . My daughter , a person who hated medications , who refused even aspirin for a headache , promised she 'd take the drugs . Once again , she returned home and went back to work . She found a psychiatrist nearby to see . <p> Then , lulled by the effective medications , Lisa stopped taking them . <p> Her phone conversations seemed normal ; she spoke of movies seen , friends visited , dinners cooked . I dared to hope , too ignorant to know that schizophrenics who recover after one episode are the exception , not the rule . <p> Eight months later , she came home to help me pack and move from the home our family had lived in for 20 years . The stress was too much for her , but in the frenzy of wrapping and storing and disposing of things , I overlooked it . I did n't notice how withdrawn she 'd become . <p> Off she went for a week 's vacation with a boyfriend . Two days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His baritone was etched with worry . " She 's mumbling to herself and acting strange . I 've brought her back home , but I do n't know what to do . I 'm leaving . " <p> He never spoke to her again . <p> My daughter 's call followed . " Mom , I . . . " Then there was nothing but the hum of the open line . <p> " What 's wrong ? Are you sick again ? Do you want me to come to you ? " There was no response from her end , only silence , and then she hung up . I phoned her doctor and waited in despair while he contacted her . <p> " She 's OK , she told me she 's making cocoa . " He did n't sound concerned . <p> " Ten minutes ago she was incoherent , " I shouted , baffled by the inconsistency . <p> His voice was calm . " Not to worry . She 's coming in for an appointment tomorrow morning and I 'll see how she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> " She did n't turn up , " he said , " and she does n't answer the phone . " Now he sounded worried . <p> " What can I do ? " <p> " I 'll call the police and get back to you , " he said . <p> Police , now . What next ? Everything stood still until the doctor rang . " Lisa 's OK . The police found her in a daze at home and I arranged for her to be taken to a private psychiatric hospital . " <p> I ran to the car , gripped the wheel , sped along the freeway , my thoughts a tangle . I broke speed limits to reach my daughter . <p> Walking down the hospital corridor , I saw the many faces of mental illness : a despondent teenager with bandaged wrists slumped in a corner ; a gray-haired matron rocking a rag doll ; a hyperkinetic boy bouncing from chair to chair , unable to settle down ; several girls who looked like high school cheerleaders . <p> In the visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say a word but smiled beatifically . Her body is here , I thought , but where , oh , where is my daughter ? Though inside I was shaking , I searched desperately for enough trivia to keep a one-sided conversation going . Like an intravenous line , I tried to pump my love through the limp hand I held in mine . All too soon , an attendant led her away and locked the door behind her with a resounding click . Tears rolled down my cheeks . I stumbled out to the car and sat huddled , unable to think or move . <p> Each day there was improvement . Lisa spoke in simple sentences : " We painted today . " She handed me a primitive sailboat picture . " I made this for you . " I swallowed the pain I felt at her childish joy in kindergarten activities . Heartsick , I wondered whether her fragmented brain would ever be put back together . <p> Gradually the medications took hold ; she returned to normal . I remained at her house until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in two weeks . <p> It 's been two years since that bleak time ; Lisa is coping well . The horror of being institutionalized has kept my daughter faithful to her medications . Thanks to the anti-psychotic drugs , she 's been able to hold a full-time job , live a reasonably normal life . But I 've had to learn to live with her uncertain future , abandon my dreams , scale down my expectations . Vulture- like , fear of another episode always hovers . <p> I keep reminding myself that Lisa was fortunate . She had savings , medical insurance , entry to the country club of mental hospitals in her city . Other schizophrenics are n't so lucky . Many live in halfway houses or get what treatment they can at city and county mental clinics . Others wander the streets . Each time I see a homeless young woman grubbing for garbage , panic floods my heart . <p> Then , I 'm grateful . She 's not Lisa . <p> How do I handle my fears ? Help is out there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alliance for the Mentally Ill ( AMI )  --  the only place where I can be open and aboveboard about Lisa . At the first meeting , with much reluctance , I spoke of the horror of her illness and my concerns for her future  --  whether she could continue to work , live alone , the possibility of relapses . Husbands , fathers , siblings around the table nodded in recognition . They quoted from articles read , spoke of struggles of their own . I left feeling lighter . The shared knowledge and compassion of other shattered families made my burden less oppressive . <p> AMI also works to discourage stereotyping and eliminate the stigma associated with this disease . Members sponsor lectures , give talks to high school students , to nurses , to the public . In some cities , families have been the prime movers in the establishment of rehabilitation centers . Others run life-saving 24-hour hotlines . <p> But changes in attitudes come slowly . Prejudice dies hard . Unlike my daughter , few schizophrenics can keep their illness private . The world needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill on medication are n't scary . But I understand and respect her reluctance to reveal her secret . Perhaps some day she will .
