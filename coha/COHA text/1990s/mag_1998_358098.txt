After years of enduring tantalizing rumors that she would win the Nobel Prize for Literature , South African novelist Nadine Gordimer developed a pat response for nosy journalists : " I would say , ' If I ever win it , I 'll let you know , ' and I 'd put the phone down . " Then one day in 1991 , while standing in the kitchen , Gordimer  --  whose piercingly authoritative phone manner reflects the high moral seriousness of such books as Burger 's Daughter and July 's People  --  received the call that ended the speculation . " I was , of course , delighted , " she says . " Everybody must be when they get the Nobel Prize . " <P> Delighted at first , that is . Caribbean poet Derek Walcott , who won the prize in 1992 , recalls a similar burst of joy followed by a prolonged state of siege . " The phone rang endlessly , and a lot of invitations came . It was a really terrible time , not terrible in a bad sense but terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't work , because it 's so demanding . " What Walcott characterizes as the Nobel 's less than phenomenal influence on his book sales did n't make up for the chaotic fuss . What did soothe him , however , was the prize money , as he frankly and cheerfully admits . " It was almost a million dollars , " he recalls . " What I 'm really grateful for is the fact that I could build a very nice house in a very nice little bay in St. Lucia with a studio . " <P> Once labeled a potential " kiss of death " by novelist Saul Bellow , after he won the prize in 1976 , the Nobel can be a bittersweet distinction . For William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway , the prize was a swan song , a tribute to past masterpieces whose greatness their subsequent work did not approach . For others , it 's just a very prestigious distraction . Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska , the 1996 laureate , complained that the prize destroyed her cherished privacy by turning her into an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief of Farrar , Straus and Giroux ( Gordimer 's and Walcott 's publisher ) , the prize can " inundate " a writer . " People , " he says , " want a piece of your ass even more than they did before . " <P> Judging by the pace at which they 're working , both Gordimer and Walcott appear to be surviving the Nobel . Gordimer 's new novel , The House Gun , which comes out this month , is a tense postapartheid family drama as vital as anything she has ever written . The protagonists are a white upper-middle-class couple who 've managed to glide through their country 's revolution without so much as a hair out of place . Then their adult son confesses to murder , and the stalled karmic wheels begin to turn . The story deftly brings home a tricky truth : peace can be as perilous as war , and even more confusing to negotiate . <P> As a member of the African National Congress , Gordimer has always been a deeply political creature , both in her public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nation 's great issue has n't cooled her intellectual fires . With her son , documentary filmmaker Hugo Cassirer , she 's currently working on a film that will contrast the recent histories of two long-divided but now reunified cities , Berlin and Johannesburg . Referring to the project , Gordimer may as well be speaking of her own experience with the Nobel : " We 've become fascinated by what happens after the initial euphoria , and how you deal with daily life .
