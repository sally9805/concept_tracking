In Belfast a bomb has blown up a truck and the British army has sealed off much of the Catholic Falls Road area . So Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams arrived a bit late for his interview with TIME deputy managing editor John Stacks and London bureau chief Barry Hillenbrand . In discussion : the conditions for participation of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the Irish Republican Army , in peace talks with the British . <P> Q. TIME : Over the past year , once bitter enemies in South Africa and the Middle East have made tremendous progress in working together . Why have n't you tried to seize the moment here with the British ? <P> A. Adams : I do n't believe that reflects a sensible notion because both of those complex situations ( ( in South Africa and the Middle East ) ) came into public prominence after years of private and presumably secret deliberations . We have deep-rooted conflict here , the legacy of some hundreds of years . The last year has seen a remarkable turnaround , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has a solid foundation . <P> Q. TIME : But it looks as if Sinn Fein is unwilling to renounce violence as a precondition for talking . <P> A. Adams : We will talk now . Sinn Fein is n't the obstacle to talks . There needs to be dialogue without preconditions . <P> Q. TIME : You think the demand for a cessation of violence is a precondition ? <P> A. Adams : I do n't think it should be . They talked to us up until last November without preconditions . What they are doing is simply taking a negotiating stance . But the whole lesson of history is that you have to have dialogue . The presence of preconditions simply puts that day off . <P> Q. TIME : Do you mean you and your party will not say " We renounce violence " at this weekend 's Sinn Fein conference or anytime down the road ? <P> A. Adams : I do n't remember Nelson Mandela renouncing violence or Arafat genuflecting . It 's a two-way process to bring about a demilitarization , to get those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be engaged in violence . But to put preconditions on people prematurely only makes the situation more problematic . Sinn Fein does n't advocate violence . We do n't advocate armed struggle . We have suffered from the violence . I want to see an unarmed strategy . I want to see a situation where the I.R.A . ceases activities . But the people who are looking down their guns at us are saying , well , you ca n't talk to us unless you renounce violence . To me it 's all meaningless , it 's all platitudes . <P> There is nothing in my political life , or in fact in my other life , that gives me any reason to trust the British . I think every Republican wants peace . But they are not war weary . They do n't want to just give up . <P> Q. TIME : Many believe you are committed to joining the peace process but you are having trouble convincing your colleagues in the movement .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
