<p> PRONOUNCED IN THE WAY THE Academie Francaise would have it , Maguy Marin 's surname sounds convincingly French . Indeed , born and brought up in Toulouse , she is widely recognized as one of France 's most innovative choreographers . And when the Lyons Opera Ballet performs her mischievous modern-day version of " Coppelia " at the opening of Lincoln Center Festival ' 96 tomorrow night , it will naturally fly the French colors . <p> Yet , at 45 , Ms. Marin still feels like something of an outsider in France . For all the public acclaim and Government subsidies that her work has received here , her blood , her cultural roots and even her surname are actually Spanish ( though she does n't use the accent , the name is properly Marin , pronounced meh-REEN rather than the French meh-RAEN ) . And this perhaps explains the distinct route she has taken as a choreographer . While her French colleagues often approach dance as an intellectual exercise , she works with emotion and plays with emotions . <p> " I am not fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French deal with each other , " she said recently , speaking in fluent French with digressions into equally fluent Spanish . " The French like to analyze , to study things from a distance . I ca n't do that . I have to be inside , involved , engaged . I like things to be more physical , more carnal . It 's my Latin character . " <p> Certainly , her " Coppelia , " which she created for the Lyons Opera Ballet in 1993 , is far sexier than anything imagined by the composer Leo Delibes and the choreographer Arthur Saint-Leon when they adapted a story from " The Tales of Hoffmann " in 1870 . Ms. Marin has set her " Coppelia " in a bleak housing project , and has replaced Dr. Coppelius 's single idealized doll with two dozen blond sirens who could have stepped out of a saucy television commercial . <p> " I felt it was a story that could be easily updated , " she said over lunch in a bistro in Lyons , where she lives . " Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're in the housing projects . Also , the original story is about a dream woman . And I thought about how today all women are under pressure to try to resemble the feminine ideal . Frantz is caught between the illusion of Coppelia and the very real Swanilda . " <p> To emphasize the fantasy , Ms. Marin uses a movie screen as a backdrop . And it is onto this screen that the aged Coppelius projects his image of the perfect woman . Later , when young Frantz seeks the mysterious blonde and drinks a glass of champagne too many with Coppelius , many Coppelias suddenly appear , stepping symbolically from screen to stage to titillate the two men as they sleep . When Frantz awakes , of course , only Swanilda awaits him . <p> This work is a far cry from traditional versions of " Coppelia " ( including Patrice Bart 's new version for the Paris Opera Ballet ) , but what truly gives it Maguy Marin 's imprint is its strong dramatic character . For Ms. Marin , dance on its own holds little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than her radical doll-house version of " Cinderella " for the Lyons Opera Ballet , which won her acclaim in New York in 1987 , is really dance-theater . To tell her story , dance , music , song , pantomime and acting are equally useful vehicles . <p> " She has a very exuberant theatricality , a Spanish and baroque vision that does not fit into the traditional conception of modernity in dance , " said Yorgos Loukos , director of the Lyons Opera Ballet . " She has a strong physical relationship with her dancers , but her movements always serve a theatrical purpose . She is very sophisticated and refined , yet not at all sober and moderate . Of all the French choreographers of her generation , she is probably the one with the strongest theatrical coherence . " <p> This is perhaps unsurprising . Born of Spanish Republican parents who came to France in 1938 , fleeing the Spanish Civil War , she was brought up surrounded by music and dance . Her father , a Communist postal worker from Andalusia , sang flamenco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang zarzuelas and the mournful tangos of Carlos Gardel . Both loved dancing . <p> " It was fantastic to watch them dance , " Ms. Marin recalled . " I have never seen anyone dance the tango as well as they did . You know , in those days , everyone gathered around the table for meals and then people would start singing . It was real popular culture . Guitars , songs , dancing . It 's like that in all popular cultures  --  singing and dancing together . I was only 8 when I sang in public for the first time . " <p> At around the same age , though , Ms. Marin began ballet lessons at the Toulouse Conservatory and was soon plunged into a world of rules and rigor . She took to this too . Only 10 years later , when she joined the corps de ballet at the Strasbourg Opera Ballet , did she discover modern dance . In 1970 , she jumped at a chance to study at Maurice Bejart 's school , Mudra , in Brussels . And it was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were truly opened . <p> " The idea was to create dancers who did more than dance , " she said . " We had courses in yoga , theater , singing , rhythm , modern dance and ballet . We learned to improvise . It was the school 's first year and it was very open , probably too open for Bejart , because he later had trouble persuading students to join his company . They thought Bejart was too classical . " <p> MS . MARIN NONETHELESS joined Bejart 's company for three years . But by 1977 , she had tired of dancing and was , as she put it , " vaccinated " against classical ballet . With Daniel Ambash , another Bejart dancer and the father of her older child ( she has two ) , she formed the Ballet Theatre de l'Arche . And by 1979 she had created her first work , " Contrastes , " for the Lyons Opera Ballet . In 1981 , the Ballet Theatre de l'Arche took up residence at the municipal theater in Creteil , a Paris suburb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated , it was renamed the Compagnie Maguy Marin . <p> By then , her work was clearly dance-theater , and it contrasted sharply with that of other French choreographers , who at the time were strongly influenced by Merce Cunningham and other American experimental choreographers . " When she began , French critics tended to prefer cerebral works , which created a sort of suspicion toward her , " Mr. Loukos said . " She was seen to be pretending to be modern because she was using techniques banished by post-modernism . " <p> As early as 1981 in " May B , " Ms. Marin sought inspiration in the desolate world of Samuel Beckett ( who urged her to be " disrespectful " ) , with her dancers doubling as actors who grunt , laugh and grimace . In " Babel , Babel , " a sort of mini-Woodstock in which naked men and woman frolic and dance , Ms. Marin herself steps forward in black leather and other punk accouterments to sing . In " Ran Dam , " her most recent work , in which she focuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . <p> She finds it far more difficult to work with a classical troupe , even one like the Lyons Opera Ballet that is made up of classical dancers but has a repertory that includes works by Bill T. Jones , Jiri Kylian , Ralph Lemon , William Forsythe and Mats Ek . For a start , there is less rehearsal time . Classical dancers also hate to " dance " on the floor , she said . And they are reluctant to take off their clothes . But most of all , she said , they are not used to acting . " If you ask them to walk normally , they walk like dancers , " she said . " When I gave them masks in ' Cinderella , ' it was a way of distancing them from classical dance . " <p> " Cinderella , " which has been performed more than 300 times since 1985 , is her biggest hit yet . " Coppelia " was well received in France , but with less fanfare . " It is not a parody of classical ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fabienne Arvers wrote in the Paris newspaper Liberation . <p> In " Coppelia , " Ms. Marin again rebels against the perfection of the classical dancer 's form , albeit disguising bodies differently . For the first half of the work , in which she deliberately echoes Jerome Robbins 's " West Side Story , " her dancers wear scruffy clothes . Then , when the scene moves to Coppelius 's apartment , her dancers , 12 men and 12 women , become chesty bimbos in tight red dresses . <p> " I have seen fat women dance the flamenco , and it 's marvelous , " Ms. Marin said . " Every kind of body is a vehicle for dance . In traditional dance , it is the dancer 's body who is served . But I think it should serve the personality that it is interpreting . If it 's about dolls , the body should serve the doll 's soul . If he is an old man serving Beckett , he has put himself inside a Beckett character . But I can not use actors because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What is clear is that Ms. Marin today is far closer to , say , Pina Bausch than to William Forsythe , who maintains closer ties to classical dance . And if she continues to turn her back on dance , it is intentional . " I do n't understand when people come out of a show and say there was n't any dance , " she said . " So what ? Have I signed a contract to create dance ? Must there be 70 percent dance in my show for me to be a choreographer . Sometimes there is no dance , just theatrical games with the body , but no dance . So perhaps I 'm not a choreographer . Perhaps I am something else . Who knows ? It does n't matter . "
