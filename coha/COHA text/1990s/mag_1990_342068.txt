Dozens of people , including police , were hurt during the two-hour riot ; at one point , Bhutto was pulled into the crowd and collapsed . <P> Government supporters and Bhutto partisans blamed each other for inciting . the violence , which postponed the hearing into charges that the former Prime Minister sold government-protected land below market rates to a London firm possibly linked to a cousin . But if the protesters ' goal was to delay proceedings until after parliamentary elections are held on Oct. 24 , they were disappointed . Another hearing is scheduled for this week . If Bhutto is found guilty , she will be banned from running in the October elections and disqualified from holding office for up to seven years .
