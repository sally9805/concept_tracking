It 's a weird claim to fame , but Warren Doyle Jr . probably holds the record for the fewest socks used while hiking all 2,157.8 miles of the Appalachian Trail : one pair . // Doyle , a 45-year-old American studies professor and director of the Outdoor Education Center at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , accomplished that odoriferous feat in the spring and summer of 1990 , when he made his fifth through-hike from Springer Mountain , Ga. , to Mount Katahdin , Maine . And he has walked the entire trail in bits and pieces four other times . " He 's on the trail more than anybody , " says Jean Cashin , who represents the Appalachian Trail Conference ( ATC ) in Harpers Ferry , W.Va. // Doyle squeaked by on one pair of his own socks in 1990 by helping himself to stray ones left behind by other hikers . Although this brought with it the indignity of wearing mismatched hosiery , in Doyle 's mind it proved an important point : You do n't need lots of clothing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn facts into myths and myths into facts , " says Doyle , who left his home in Clifton , Va. , on April 29 to knock off through-hike number 6 , which should be history by Labor Day . " We have to question who 's telling us what we need and why are they telling us. " // You think top-of-the-line waterproof boots are necessary ? Big myth . Doyle wears sneakers that he picks up for a buck a pair at garage sales . They go nicely with his secondhand backpack and five &amp; dime sleeping bag . Think a famished body needs to be refueled with hot meals ? Another myth . Doyle does n't even carry a mess kit , choosing instead to subsist largely on cookies and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches . Afraid to drink the water on the trail ? Shucks , says Doyle , a little giardia never hurt anybody . If a muddy stream is good enough for deer , it 's good enough for him . // " He strips things down to the essentials , and then he removes a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ga. , a member of the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association , which Doyle founded 12 years ago . " Warren may well be the Abbie Hoffman of the Appalachian Trail . " // Doyle does n't look like a revolutionary  --  or , for that matter , a marathon hiker . A disobedient shock of thinning hair tops a face that frequently sports a nervous jack-o ' - lantern smile . Doyle has a doughy belly , short arms and a rolling gait that evokes visions of a boardwalk cop walking the beat with a chili dog in hand . // But make no mistake : Doyle dearly loves hiking the AT , questioning authority and speaking his mind . The Appalachian Trail came under federal control in 1968 with the passage of the National Trails System Act , which expedited the acquisition of surrounding land . Only 44 miles of the AT remain privately owned , and Doyle is miffed . A lifetime member of the ATC , but also a lifelong prickly individualist , he rails against the government 's right of eminent domain . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer 's handshake , " says Doyle . " To me the point of the trail is trust . " // Doyle does n't applaud when stretches of the AT are relocated around expanding cities and towns . He considers the jumble of wilderness , history and society to be part of the trail 's special charm . Nor does he cotton to the closing of chunks of the trail during forest fires , or to rangers posting signs about unsafe drinking water . Too many rules . Too much meddling with nature , Doyle says . // " I think Warren would like to believe all people are basically good-hearted and would love the trail , and you would n't have to manage it , " says Brian King , the ATC 's director of public relations . " There would be no rules , because people would bring their own rules . But that 's not the way it is. " // Doyle pleads guilty to being a romantic . One of his favorite poems is Walt Whitman 's Song of the Open Road , which contains the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe you are not all/that is here , I believe that much unseen is also here . " No wonder Doyle thinks a through-hike on the AT is the wisest possible use of several months ' time . Such a venture is not merely a matter of paying overdue attention to the way the sun slants through Virginia pines or the lullaby of rain on a tent roof . It 's a chance to shed the constricting skin of routine , to assess a life in progress . It involves committing oneself to a goal and disciplining the mind to overcome discomfort and fatigue and all those PB-&amp;-J sandwiches . In short , Doyle 's hikes are n't simply walks in the woods . // " I 'm not spending 127 days away from loved ones for something as frivolous as recreation , " he says . But Doyle 's introduction to the outdoors was just that : He did run-of-the-mill backpacking in Vermont and New Hampshire while attending Southern Connecticut State . Then , while he was working one summer as a volunteer in the mountains of Jamaica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social conscience stirred . In 1973 , at 23 , Doyle decided he needed a rigorous challenge , " something that had no material reward , no trophy , no cheerleaders , nothing like that . " // He settled on doing a solo through-hike of the Appalachian Trail and completed the trip from Georgia to Maine in the then record time of 66 days , dropping 32 pounds along the way . Doyle was in graduate school at Southern Connecticut State at the time , pursuing a doctorate in education . Upon his return he did day hikes on the Connecticut portion of the AT with friends , among them his wife , Ginger , and out of those forays sprang the notion of writing his dissertation on the interaction of a group of hikers navigating the entire trail . // In 1975 Doyle led  --  and he uses the term loosely  --  a party of 19 hikers from Georgia to Maine . Although group pilgrimages were virtually unheard of on the AT , everyone made it . // Doyle had discovered what amounted to his calling . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people look at it , and the trail would be his tool . He led group hikes in 1977 , ' 80 and ' 90 , and this summer 14 people , ranging from college students to senior citizens , are following him along the undulating path to New England . // " Warren really is a philosopher-educator and is using the trail as a metaphor , " says Tom Steinmann , a Nashville producer who made a film of Doyle 's 1990 excursion . " I do n't know how many hikes he has to do to feel there 's a completion to this process , but I could see him doing this for the rest of his life . Because it 's really not just the through-hike . It 's the center point of everything that he 's about . " // On Doyle 's four group hikes that are already in the books , 56 of 59 people gutted it out from beginning to end . That is an astounding success rate , considering that 1,500 to 2,000 hikers set out to do the full AT each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows every little nook and cranny along the trail that could make it more enjoyable , " says Jamie Keeble , a Virginia schoolteacher who was on the 1990 trek . " Every swimming hole , all-you-can-eat restaurant and ice cream stop . " // Doyle preps his hikers with a series of grueling three-day outings , some held two years before departure day . He passes along practical tips , from the wisdom of a slow-but-steady pace to his rule-of-thumb weather prognosis ( expect 20% of the days to be rainy , 20% dry , 20% hot , 20% cold , and 20% made-to-order lovely ) . // But the crux of Doyle 's AT survival credo is a Three Musketeerish sense of interdependence . Everybody puts in $300 to cover general expenses and camping fees . More important , 12 times en route to Maine , Doyle and company link hands and pronounce their commitment to the cause : They 'll hike every step of the Appalachian Trail ; they 'll adhere to a strict schedule that averages 17 miles a day ; arid , come hail or high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team . // Doyle , who forgoes such amenities as sunglasses , suntan lotion , pocket knife and underwear , does n't demand that his compatriots travel as lightly as he does . In order to squeeze the trip into 127 days and to give group members the advantage of toting day packs , a support van hauls their main supplies . That luxury offends some AT purists , as does Doyle 's touchy-feely , we-are-the-world hiking philosophy . But those who have trudged the AT alongside Doyle swear by him and his circle . // Four months of enduring bug bites and blisters , of savoring fresh blueberries and the blush of setting suns can leave a lasting imprint on one 's soul . " One of the things that it did was awaken something in me : my connection with nature , the community spirit , " says Keeble . " It did magnify to me how much I really need people in my life . " // Keeble has felt AT euphoria once . Doyle is addicted . The trail is in his blood . He keeps returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children this summer , but the trail beckons . As always , he draws strength from his sore-footed friends and rejoices at seeing the are of a rainbow and hearing a loon 's wail . He will blubber like a new Miss America when at last he stands again atop misty Mount Katahdin . And , as always , nothing on the AT is exactly the same . " Every time I go out there I learn more , " says Doyle , " because I 'm different every time I go . " // He and his wife have split now . He is a little older and creakier . His red trail beard shows streaks of gray . No question , the Warren Doyle treading the Appalachian Trail this summer is a changed man . This time he even packed three pairs of socks .
