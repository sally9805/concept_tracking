<p> What 's the difference between Chanel No. 5 and Chanel No. 19 ? Ask Cyranose 2000 , an artificial proboscis that s sniffing out the market <p> The strange scent-detection device demonstrated by the sales team from Cyrano Sciences looked a little like a candy-colored cell phone . But to the nurses at the University of California , Los Angeles Dental School , it seemed as beautiful as a mouthful of perfectly capped teeth . <p> A program at the Dental School was testing remedies for oral malodor  --  in other words , chronic bad breath  --  and the nurses were taking turns monitoring patients ' progress . The methodology was simple : Nurse puts nose to patient 's mouth , then everyone breathes deeply . Professionalism aside , no one involved walked away savoring the experience . <p> Why not try the Cyranose 2000 instead ? According to Steven Sunshine , the earnest , 38-year-old president and CEO of Cyrano , his company 's handheld detector promised not only a welcome reprieve for the nurses but also vastly improved accuracy in halitosis research . A smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective experience of airborne chemicals known as odorants . Far better , according to Sunshine , to quantify the aroma in question by relying on the Cyranose 2000 's 32 precise sensors . <p> As a sales pitch , it was a slam-dunk Unfortunately for Cyrano Sciences , marketing its new electronic nose to other prospective customers wo n't be half as easy . The company , a startup staffed by chemistry PhDs and electrical engineers eager to make their mark in business , faces a customer landscape studded with skeptical purchasing managers , disparate technological requirements and the simple fact that the world has thus far been doing just fine without an electronic nose . From the food industry , to animal husbandry , to contraband law enforcement , the **29;611;TOOLONG at Cyrano Sciences must tackle head-on the single most after the initial phase of product development : inventing a market . <p> Conjuring demand out of whole cloth is common currency for pioneers in any industry . Apple Computer stared down the challenge in the early 1980s . Consumer goods titans such as Procter &; Gamble and Gillette regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture of desire with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual advertising . Today , life for some would be next to unlivable without triple-bladed razors and 500-megahertz personal computers . Soon , we may not be able to get by without our smell machines . At least , that 's the plan . <p> With the launch of the $5,000 Cyranose 2000 slated for this fall , Sunshine and company are setting out to sample the waters in two trial markets : detecting " off " odors in packaging materials , and quality control testing of raw materials such as soda concentrates for the food industry . Cyrano will face entrenched competition from both high-end , specialty analytical instruments as well as from what might be termed an installed base of human noses . Specifically , the device will have to out-sniff professional teams of olfactorily acute individuals known as human " sensory panels " employed by consumer goods makers . ( Facing a related dilemma , Scott Cook , the co-founder of personal accounting software leader Intuit , once quipped that his toughest competitor was his customers ' stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cyranose 2000 is the brainchild of a chemist named Nathan Lewis at the California Institute of Technology , who in 1993 began pondering the workings of the human nose-an organ responsible for what is arguably the most versatile and least understood of the five senses . Lewis , along with then-postdoc Mike Freund , decided to design a synthetic sniffer . The strikingly simple solution they hit upon ( see diagram , p. 67 ) entails doping ordinary polymer plastics with particles of a conductive material , such as carbon black . Painted onto a ceramic surface , electrons move through such composites at a predictable rate . But expose it to an odorant , and the plastic starts absorbing vapor molecules and swells like a sponge . Because the swelling alters the spacing between the conductive particles , it creates an easily measured change in the composite 's electrical resistance . <p> As it turns out , every type of plastic has its own unique chemical likes and dislikes . Some readily absorb oily vapors such as benzene , others prefer water . By creating an array of sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to generate a distinct electronic pattern for every odor . The next step was to record the patterns that different smells induced in the sensor array . Once trained , this " nose chip " could recognize fragrances it had been exposed to previously and determine when they changed . <p> Lewis learned that similar technology had already been invented by scientists in the United Kingdom , who had started their own company , AromaScan . In fact , the Brits were just one among a half-dozen firms that had been attempting to sell artificial probosces . But partly because of their high cost , these instruments had found little success and today the electronic nose market still remains puny at less than $15 million per year . <p> Lewis believed his approach was more versatile than the British system and , because it was so simple , would also be very cheap to manufacture . After building a prototype system with the help of Caltech chemistry professors Robert Grubbs and electrical engineer Rodney Goodman , the device 's commercial potential began to crystallize . Lewis was issued a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a **35;642;TOOLONG named Seth Harrison began sniffing around the Caltech labs . By April 1997 , Cyrano Sciences had been formed with the university 's blessing , a license to the electronic nose patent and Harrison as interim CEO . <p> Taking over the kind of gray , nondescript warehouse in suburban Pasadena that even longtime neighbors never really notice , the company began hiring a product development team , mostly chemists and other materials scientists . For more than a year and a half , the researchers fabricated arrays of organic polymer sensors , wrote software to recognize the electrical " fingerprints " yielded by individual vapors , and built a dizzying number of plastic-molded prototypes . The engineering team endlessly tested the nose-chip designs against various women 's perfumes . " Our goal , which we eventually accomplished , was to get it down to where it could detect the differences between Chanel No. 5 and Chanel No. 19 , " says Greg Steinthal , head of the engineering department . <p> The quasi-academic environment and dearth of business-types were part of the strategic plan put in place by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company since its inception . " Too many MBAs in an early technology development program might lead you in the right business direction , but they wo n't understand the real technology issues . That can throw off the corporate timing , " says Harrison , a general manager at Oak Investment Partners in Westport , Conn. , which , along with Johnson &; Johnson 's investment arm and Marquette Venture Partners , has so far pumped $12 million into the enterprise . <p> While basic science and engineering remained the task at hand , the company made an effort to hire people with commercial experience  --  especially aspiring entrepreneurs languishing in large corporations . Steinthai was brought in from Telaire Systems , where he had already helped push a carbon dioxide sensor to the market . Sunshine was hired as chief of R &D; from manufacturing giant Raychem , where he 'd led an in-house incubator . According to Sunshine , the common denominator among his colleagues is " knowing when to stop researching . " ( Little wonder that Lewis and the other Caltech inventors had chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of this year , with most of the kinks worked out of the device , Cyrano was ready to make the seismic shift to an enterprise focused on the unscientific domain of salesmanship . Sunshine was promoted from research boss to CEO and began recruiting a marketing staff thick with technical backgrounds . <p> A key hire was Saskia Feast , a British chemist whom Sunshine gave the title of technical marketing manager and tasked with sizing up potential customers . Up until this point , the nose 's creators and investors bad been doing plenty of daydreaming about applications ( busting drug dealers , diagnosing cancer ) and had come up with a laundry list of some 20 potential markets . But which were most likely to make the jump to the unfamiliar nose-chip technology ? Feast has been boning up on a score of industries in order to find out . <p> She began by identifying 73 large prospective customers , and is now grading them on a scale from " one " to " five , " depending how on difficult the sale looks . The fives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated businesses where new technology means risky change , and electronic noses are eyed with suspicion . For instance , in the chemicals industry workers assess accidental spills by breaking a sample down into its chemical subcomponents , then analyzing each part . Cyrano 's argument is that the industry could skip this detailed analysis if it knew roughly what spills contained  --  something the nose chip could do with one whiff . But the chemicals industry is n't used to diagnosing blended elements and Feast expects Cyrano 's message will be hard to get through . <p> For reasons that are hardly mysterious , food companies represent the overwhelming number of zeros and ones in Feast 's database . The industry , she says , " is filled with people very familiar with using smell " to detect spoiled food . Real noses , however , while quite precise , are attached to people who are n't perfectly engineered for the job : They get cold and tired , and lose their edge after repeated contact with similar odors . But even the food industry is no easy sale : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection and not delivering ; Cyrano is pegging its hopes for a marketing knockout on an industry not entirely eager to get back into the ring . <p> With a large , fragmented market full of companies ready to turn up their noses at newfangled technology , Feast 's strategy is to seed the machine among " opinion influencers " in their industries , such as Kraft Foods and DuPont . The hope is to convert these key customers into nose chip evangelists . The same goes for the company 's academic allies : Cyrano is a member of the Monell Institute 's Chemical Senses Center , as well as the Media Lab at MIT . " The idea that we 're a flash in the pan is something we always have to deal with , " says Bruce Hermann , director of applications engineering , and a force in the company 's marketing efforts . <p> The search for stability has also led Cyrano into what Hermann terms " a delicate dance " with a predatory competitor . In March , Cyrano signed a pact with Hewlett-Packard to jointly develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scientific instrument giant already sells a vapor detection device of its own , a hulking , refrigerator-sized appliance called the HP 4440A Chemical Sensor , priced at $80,000 . <p> Cyrano brings to HP 's table a technology that might turn out to be a " category killer . " The deal 's potential benefits for Cyrano are enormous , giving the company instant clout with potential customers and bolstering its reach into new sales channels . But HP 's ultimate intention is something of an unknown , and there 's no hiding the risk for Cyrano . Even the folks at HP do n't shy from pointing it out . " Collaborating with HP is a two-edged sword for them " observes Mary Pat Knauss , future products marketing manager at HP 's Wilmington , Del. facility . <p> The pact gives Cyrano " a stamp of credibility " but also holds the risk of terminally narrowing the smaller firm 's future . Losing its identity in HP 's embrace could mean becoming just another supplier for a line of odor detectors carrying the HP logo . Sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a " Cyrano Inside " sticker . He 's only half kidding , because in fact Cyrano does plan to engage in what Sunshine calls " chip-based design , " a.k.a. electronic nose as universal electronic component . Sunshine imagines the nose chips could be integrated into many consumer products , for instance , a microwave oven that knows when food is cooked . Or firefighting equipment that can tell the nature of a blaze  --  chemical , electrical or arboreal . <p> Leaving the marketing to HP or another company would also allow Cyrano 's engineers to do what they seem to love best , which is solving problems . Already the hunt for new applications has taken company officials as far afield as a Pennsylvania dairy farm , where the electronic nose holds promise for sensing which cows are in heat and ready for artificial insemination . ( Currently , farmers use a bull , often leaving the animal in a state of homicidal frustration . ) Cyrano is also studying how well their nose can mimic human sensory values . That is , they 're teaching it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing project with the Los Angeles Municipal Sanitation Department looks to size up the stink from sanitation leaks . <p> The work of forging new markets for a new product is not , it seems , totally unlike olfaction itself : both are endless , episodic trails of new experiences , not all pleasant . Standing in front of a blank whiteboard in Cyrano Sciences ' expansive warehouse-office , Sunshine talks about how he now spends most of his time  --  preparing for the product launch and hunting for money . With a " substantial " burn rate ( the amount of cash the company inhales each month without earning any revenue ) Sunshine is busy raising a second round of financing . He 's confident he will secure it , but the stress of running the company shows in his boyish features , lust then , someone enters the room carrying one of the brightly colored Cyranose 2000 prototypes . Suddenly , Sunshine 's eyes cease blinking and his face takes on the look of someone who can detect the sweet smell of success .
