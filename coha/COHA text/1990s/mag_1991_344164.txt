Was the illegal diversion of profits from Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan contras an unauthorized plot hatched by a small band of zealots in Ronald Reagan 's National Security Council ? Or did high-ranking members of the U.S. intelligence community not only learn about the scheme and do nothing to stop it , but unlawfully help to conceal it from Congress ? <P> Those unsettling questions have become the focus of the investigation by Lawrence E. Walsh , who has been the Iran-contra independent counsel since December 1986 . His inquiry is being assisted by Alan Fiers , former head of the CIA 's Central American Task Force , who has admitted misleading Congress about when the agency first learned of the diversions . Fiers now says he became aware of the fund transfers during the summer of 1986 and warned the agency 's deputy director of operations , Clair E. George , about them . But he charges that George ordered him to deny any knowledge of the U.S. role in supplying weapons to the contras when he testified before the House intelligence committee in October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek perjury indictments against George and others . They have also cast a shadow over President Bush 's nomination of Deputy National Security Adviser Robert M. Gates to become the CIA 's director . <P> Last week the Senate intelligence committee postponed Gates ' confirmation hearings so that investigators can probe further his knowledge of the illegal supply effort . Some Senators find it hard to believe that Gates could not have known about an operation with which his boss , the late CIA chief William Casey , and his subordinates were familiar . Gates claimed repeatedly that he had only vague inklings about the unauthorized aid in late 1986 , when he served as deputy to Casey . But late last week , in response to new reports that he was briefed several times on help to the contras , the White House acknowledged that Gates had played a central role in overseeing aspects of the plan  --  but only the intelligence and communications parts that Congress had authorized . <P> Walsh discussed the case with TIME , including how disagreements with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh over the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had a lot of problems in this prosecution with classified information . How did that affect your work ? <P> A. The classified-information problem is frustrating because there is no review of the subjective judgment of the intelligence agencies in saying they will not release information that a court has held necessary for a fair trial . <P> It 's not just information that the government needs to prosecute its case . The problem also arises when the defendant asks for information he says is necessary for a fair trial and the judge agrees with him . And then the intelligence agency holds back that information on what sometimes seems to be an excessive claim of the need for the secrecy of information that is already publicly known .
