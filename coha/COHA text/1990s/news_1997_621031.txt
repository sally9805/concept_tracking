<p> AT A MOST unusual time  --  Michael Jordan 's time  --  the NBA showed last week that dreams come in all sizes . <p> Plenty of kids were at the playground that Friday afternoon , pretending to be Jordan . There might have been a few Allen Iversons in the bunch , certainly a John Stockton , maybe a Kerry Kittles or Bobby Sura . The greater the talent , the more vivid the imagination . <p> In the wake of the Bulls ' championship , a new kind of dreamer was born . He 's a little red- head , the kid who usually gets picked last when they choose up teams . Now he 's shooting alone in his driveway . He 's wide-open behind the free-throw line . He 's Steve Kerr , for crying out loud . <p> " This is for the title . . . It 's a 16-footer . . . It 's good ! Jordan 's hugging him ! The crowd goes crazy ! " <p> Kerr 's stunning game-winner seems especially poignant now , at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nation 's interest . Is there a life after Jordan ? Just what is the state of the NBA ? <p> Let 's put it this way : The league needs Jordan in the worst way . Doubts about the future are thoroughly justified . But hold the doomsday forecast until that day actually arrives . <p> Start with the strong points in the NBA 's favor : <p> * It 's Fantastic . Says so right there in the advertisement , so it must be true . Never mind that this year 's playoffs were largely a disappointment , particularly in the Eastern Conference . The league says everything 's wonderful , fans storm the arenas and we anxiously await each telecast at home . That 's called building an image . The NBA does it better than anyone . <p> * The league has by far the most generous television policies of the major sports , making it readily available entertainment for the common man . <p> Baseball is hopelessly behind , as usual , routinely botching postseason availability and blacking out hundreds of games on satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hey , you explain why the A 's and Giants ' road games are blacked out on DirecTV ) . <p> Football continues to black out home games if they are n't sold out , a policy that smacks of elitism  --  a frontal assault on the poor and impoverished , who live for the games but ca n't afford to attend them in person or buy into some ludicrous PSL ripoff . Even if they buy the satellite dish  --  sorry , the blackout applies there , too . <p> The NBA continues to do a disservice to young fans on the East Coast , starting games of the championship series at 9 p.m. ( maybe those little Jordan fans have parents with VCRs ) , but it remains far ahead of the field , showing every playoff game ( on one of three networks ) and making virtually every regular-season game available on satellite-TV packages . You can watch an NBA game if you 're really serious about it , and that 's how it should be . <p> * Commissioner David Stern has a death grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care if he 's done it through graft , corruption and bribery ( nor do any such accusations exist ) . Stern 's NBA has never lost a game to a labor crisis , and that is critical to its good reputation . <p> * The league is a runaway success internationally , and not merely because of Jordan , Shaq and Magic Johnson . The NBA is peerless in international relations and marketing , causing a frenzy over the game in countless countries around the world . When some NFL team plays in London , it 's a joke . When the NBA goes to Paris , it 's a happening . <p> * Here at home , the game is sold brilliantly through sporting- goods products and television advertisements . Pick any six Jordan commercials , and they 're likely to be better than anything the NFL or baseball people have produced since the old Miller Lite gems . Shaq has great ads ; so do Grant Hill and Kobe Bryant . It helps that these people happen to be the hippest , most urbane athletes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * The star system is in place  --  just barely . The league needs great teams and superheroes . As long as the Bulls keep the core of Jordan- Scottie Pippen-Phil Jackson , the world will stop during the month of June . <p> But the flip side of the NBA picture starts right there . For the first time in league history , there is genuine concern about a player retiring . <p> Bob Cousy 's retirement was n't even an issue on his own team ; the Celtics ' backcourt was turned over to Sam and K.C. Jones . Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain gave way to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton . Greatness passed through Jerry West , Oscar Robertson , John Havlicek , Walt Frazier , Magic Johnson and Larry Bird . A single player 's retirement meant nothing . Even in the late ' 70s , regarded as the dark ages of NBA basketball , there was Walton , Julius Erving , Marques Johnson , George Gervin , Bob McAdoo , Pete Maravich , Rick Barry and Bernard King  --  an infinitely more appealing group than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire tomorrow , who could legitimately carry on the league 's fine tradition ? Shaq ? Grant Hill ? Kevin Garnett ? It 's a little late for Olajuwon , Barkley or Malone to inherit the throne , and until further notice , the young stars ' credibility remains in serious doubt . <p> There are other problems , to say the least . The salary cap is portrayed as a stroke of genius , but it has given the league a putrid brand of parity . When Jordan leaves , there will be no great teams as we 've known them over the years . Trades  --  the lifeblood of conversation , especially among fans of downtrodden teams  --  are almost impossible to make . Sure , the cap puts teams on equal financial footing , but it has n't done one damn thing for the quality of play . If anything , it has been a deterrent . <p> Stern actually went on record saying that his administration made the league safe for African Americans . That 's absurd . Maybe the television people believed that ; they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:30 p.m . But the mainstream of American fandom has been hooked on the NBA since Russell took on Chamberlain . They loved the Celtics ' all- black starting lineup of Russell , Sanders , Naulls , Jones and Jones . For that matter , they kind of fancied Beaty , Bridges , Caldwell , Hudson and Wilkens on the St. Louis Hawks . They did n't give up in ' 78 when Seattle played Washington for the championship . They loved the game with the same passion and dedication . So just throw that racial-enlightenment business right out the window . If any American hated the predominantly black NBA of the past , you can bet he still does . <p> There are serious problems on the court . The once-great Eastern Conference has become a pushover for Jordan , offering little more than Alonzo Mourning , the dreadful Knicks and cheap novelties like the Hawks or Chris Webber . This used to stand for Russell trying to get past Robertson or Chamberlain so he could get to West and Baylor ; Bird fighting for his life against Erving or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's more like Tim Hardaway , from 33 feet , and on to the next round . <p> We 've harped on the team-play issue throughout the playoffs , but the fact remains : Without John Stockton and the Bulls ' coaching hierarchy , it 's a league of boring isolation plays . The illegal-defense rule is a joke , forcing officials to watch a defender 's position on the floor instead of more important matters  --  like that elbow to the face , just out of view , while you tried to figure out if Ewing was guarding anybody . The latest proposal is to allow any defense , but only on the strong side of the court . What , are they kidding with this ? Allow any defense , you fools . Nobody 's going to play a zone for 48 minutes ; no great coach ever has . But allow for the possibility and stop the idiot worrying over who 's " illegal . " <p> It 's nice to have a " young-man 's game , " but teenagers are starting to rule the NBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , forsaking their education and putting the rest of their lives at risk . They get embarrassing multi-million dollar contracts before they 've taken a dribble . Then they have the power to leave , after three years , and torch their team 's investment . Not to mention someone like Joe Smith , who talks of leaving almost immediately and casts a pall over the organization . ( Solution : Ca n't play in the league until you 're 21 . Age discrimination be damned . And here , take this $ 200,000 salary until we find out you can play . ) <p> Inside the arena , we all have a great chance of going deaf  --  if we do n't set fire to the place first . Twenty-second timeout ? Whoa , here come 15 gymnasts with mats ! That gets you in the old pick-and- roll mood , does n't it ? The world 's worst music  --  absolutely the most lame selections ever produced in this country  --  comes through the loudspeakers at deafening levels . Mascots come flying down flights of stairs ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Announcers go crazy , without the slightest regard for what 's happening on the floor . My favorite moment came in this year 's Chicago-Miami series : The Bulls were way ahead , the crowd was sagging , and as a meaningless hoop went through the basket , the clue-free announcer yelled , " Alonnnnnnn- zooooooo MOOOOURRRRRRning ! " While about three people clapped their hands . <p> That 's your league today , Mr. Stern . The big dumb-down . In terms of taste , you 're about three steps shy of the X-Games . A good commissioner stands for Boston Garden , Ella Fitzgerald , Wynton Marsalis . You apparently stand for Chuck E. Cheese . Blue hair . The good time inherent in trashing a hotel room . " High School High . " God help us all when play stops in the NBA . Then comes the real entertainment , and it 's enough to make you want to leave the country . <p> And to top it all off , nobody can shoot . Well , actually , Jordan can shoot . So can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't shoot . The future has been slammin ' and crossover-dribbling and not even thinking to pass , because that 's how life is on the playgrounds , and that 's fine ; you ca n't argue with society . Nevertheless , the future ca n't shoot . <p> Kobe Bryant , all of 18 years old , stepped up to take three critical shots in the Lakers ' final game against Utah because nobody else had the guts to take on the responsibility . It was a testament to Bryant 's savvy and confidence  --  this kid likes to pretend he 's Jordan , from the talk to the moves to the tongue hanging out  --  and it was wonderful to watch him address the moment . But Bryant drew nothing but air on all three shots . <p> " By the time I was 18 , I had n't shot three airballs in my life , " marveled Houston 's Matt Bullard . No kidding . Jerry West might never have shot one . Great shooters fire airballs on uncontested shots maybe once in 10 years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bullard . " They work on the open-court game and on breaking guys down off the dribble and dunking . " <p> So what is the NBA , in the end ? Well , it 's Fantastic , of course . It was quite often magical during the Finals in Chicago and Salt Lake City . Late in the evenings , around the press hospitality rooms , we talked Michael Jordan for hours . There was the sense of witnessing true greatness , like Ali against Cleveland Williams or Pele against England , and we were incredibly fortunate to have seen it from close range . <p> WHAT 'S RIGHT <p> . <p> * A strong image of entertaining play <p> * All games available on TV , in contrast with Major League baseball and the NFL <p> * No player strikes , so far <p> * International appeal <p> * Superb marketing <p> * Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls <p> . <p> . <p> WHAT 'S WRONG <p> . <p> * Jordan 's age ( 34 ) . He 's nearing retirement , and none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * The salary cap , which has all but eliminated great teams and has made trades nearly impossible . <p> * Erosion of team play <p> * Influx of teenaged players who get rich contracts before they 've established themselves . <p> * Problems in arenas : deafening music , idiotic PA announcers , dumb mascots . <p> * Inability of most players to shoot
