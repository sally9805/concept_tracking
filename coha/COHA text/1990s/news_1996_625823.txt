<p> Oilers fans deserve a plan to keep team <p> An open letter to Mayor Bob Lanier : <p> The next time you attend a Rockets game from your $ 300 courtside seat , try to imagine the following : The Rockets are playing their final season in Houston because the mayor of Houston has decided that the citizens of Houston do not want to spend any tax money to build the Rockets a new arena in Houston . The mayor declares : " " We 're the fourth-largest market in the country , so our chances are good of attracting another NBA team in the future if the Rockets leave . " <p> How would you feel , Bob Lanier ? Would going to an NBA game in The Summit to cheer on the Houston Clippers excite you ? Would it ever be the same for you as supporting the Houston Rockets ? <p> This is the situation that Oilers fans face . We 're not particularly interested in supporting a team that has moved here from another city . We have memories of Earl , Bum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Bruce Matthews and Ray Childress finish their careers in Houston . We have hopes of seeing Steve McNair and Chris Sanders develop into superstars in Houston , not Nashville . We can not understand your blase attitude to this whole situation . <p> At some point you decided that a new domed stadium was not feasible for Houston . While this is certainly a valid viewpoint , Oilers fans are left to wonder why officials in Cleveland , Seattle , Cincinnati , Chicago and Tampa Bay have produced written plans to keep their teams while you have produced no concrete plan to keep the Oilers . The least that Oilers fans should expect from the mayor of Houston is an active interest in keeping the team in Houston . <p> Frankly , we 're tired of hearing about what you ca n't do to keep the Oilers . We want to hear about what you can do to keep the team here where they belong . Put together a plan and put it in writing so we can debate it . Oilers fans deserve nothing less . <p> Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in late August , he and County Judge Robert Eckels put forth two options - building a new open-air stadium or renovating Rice Stadium to meet NFL standards - as alternatives to renovating the Astrodome . In October , Lanier suggested the sale of permanent seat licenses , luxury boxes and naming rights for a new stadium could raise $ 120 million to $ 145 million for a new stadium , but he has yet to make public anything more specific . <p> Last train to Greedville - It would be a tragedy for the Oilers to leave our city . I am a strong supporter of the Oilers , and it would hurt me deeply to see them leave . <p> The person who needs to leave is Bud Adams . Bud Adams does not care about my Houston Oilers . <p> I have attended Oilers games since 1979 . I was in attendance back in 1980 when the city had a rally for the Oilers after they were beaten by the Steelers in the playoffs . I watched in amazement as the Oilers blew their sure thing in Buffalo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team is headed back in the right direction . It seems only fitting that Bud Adams wants to move them . <p> If I only had the money , the Oilers certainly would not be leaving . At least we have arena football . It would n't surprise me if Bud Adams did n't try to take that away from us also on his way to Greedville . <p> Eric Woloson Houston <p> Etched in stone - Way to go John McClain ! That was great thinking on your part for donating the $ 15 check , which Mayor Bob Lanier sent to the Chronicle for one month 's subscription , as a down payment on a new stadium . Just think , if you write an article that offends him every day , we 'll have a ground-breaking ceremony in a couple of years . <p> It 's a shame that our local politicians do n't see the same value in the Oilers as the fans do . At least there are some politicians who are willing to do whatever it takes to obtain the Oilers , it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said that he would try to get an NFL franchise if the Oilers leave . That does n't make any sense because then we would have to not only pay for a new stadium , but also pay for a new team . That 's twice as much money we would have to dish out . Keeping the Oilers in Houston Really Will Save You Money ! <p> We already have fans here in Houston . We already have a strong football tradition in Houston . We already have the Oilers here in Houston ! Why does he want to throw it all away and start all over again ? Let 's just get this stadium built . We 'll even get Bob Lanier 's name etched in stone on the building . <p> Aaron Thomas Waco <p> Gleam of hope - At last ! Fran Blinebury 's two columns of Jan. 2 and 3 relative to the Nebraska football program are a wonderful eye-opener as well as a gleam of hope that finally even people in sports - and I do n't in any way restrict this to sportswriters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are awakening to the position that football should be in our world . That a football player is not above the law ! <p> That coaches who put them above the law are themselves guilty , perhaps even of stealing from our younger kids . <p> May you continue your presentation of this line of thought , and you have done so to this point in a considerate , understandable mature manner that will generate respect and perhpas join others to that line of thought . <p> Walter E. Belt , Jr . Flatonia <p> Blinebury out of bounds - Regarding Fran Blinebury 's Jan. 3 " " critique " of the Fiesta Bowl ( Cornhuskers far from perfect ) : Fran , you 're just one of many thousands of sportswriters , not a criminal psychologist or jurisprudence expert . Period . Stick to what you know . <p> The Cornhuskers were perfect except for two interceptions , and they played an outstanding game . Does Lawrence Phillips need counseling ? Of course ! Does Warren Moon need character improvement ? Obviously ! Was Pete Rose above reproach concerning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each case , these off-field indiscretions took away from their natural ability , talent and accomplishments not one iota . Tom Osborne saw the opportunity to salvage a fine athlete and person and to help in the corrective steps . Let 's give that coach yet another accolade for this insight . Does it wipe away Phillips ' out-of-uniform infraction ? Absolutely not ! <p> So , please . . . report the game . <p> James Deaux Pasadena <p> Osborne deserves respect - Fran Blinebury is right to say that Lawrence Phillips does not deserve the praise and accolades people have given him recently . Yet , Fran has no right whatsoever to take anything away from Tom Osborne . He does deserve all the recognition , praise , and accolades people have given him . Here is a man who has influenced and helped hundreds upon hundreds of student athletes to become fine , upstanding citizens . That , far more than his winning percentage , deserves and commands your respect and admiration . <p> Jason McLendon Pasadena <p> Niekro deserving - I am disgusted that Phil Niekro again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of his 318 wins were for the pitiful Atlanta Braves . He did n't have the luxury of pitching for the LA Dodgers or Big Red Machine . <p> With no bullpen help and little or no run support , he kept the woeful Braves in many a game . His starting assignments were often against the opposing team 's ace . His ERA and win percentage reflect the fact that he was all the pitching the Braves had for any given year . A true competitor and a great pitcher , Knucksie deserves to be in the Hall of Fame . <p> Tom Porter Houston <p> TYPE : Letters
