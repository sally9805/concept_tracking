<p> Last of five articles <p> Two decades of study about the sexual stereotyping of girls is now inspiring a new subject for gender research : boys . <p> Our boys are in trouble , say a vanguard of researchers , and it 's time to pay attention to how we are raising them . <p> The case begins with numbers . Boy babies die in greater numbers in infancy , and are more fragile as babies than girls . Boys are far more likely than girls to be told they have learning disabilities , to be sent to the principal 's office , to be given medication for hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder , to be suspended from high school , to commit crimes , to be diagnosed as schizophrenic or autistic . In adolescence , they kill themselves five times more often than girls do . In adulthood , they are being incarcerated at ever-increasing rates , abandoning families , and becoming more likely to be both the perpetrators and victims of violence . <p> Some psychologists and educators studying boys argue that because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an overlay of popular culture , male children do not fully develop their capacity for emotional depth and complexity . As a result , they are less able than they need to be to navigate the turmoil of adolescence , to develop healthy adult relationships , in some cases to survive at all . While the simple hierarchy of male authority and dominance in our society is becoming obsolete , the men of tomorrow are not being trained for a world in which their traditional survival mechanisms  --  like physical strength , bluster and bullying  --  no longer prevail . Meanwhile , traditionally male virtues like courage and determination are too often neglected . <p> " An enormous crisis of men and boys is happening before our eyes without our seeing it . There 's been an extraordinary shift in the plate tectonics of gender ; everything we ever thought is open for examination , " said Barney Brawer , a longtime educator . Brawer is managing the boys component of the Harvard Project on Women 's Psychology , Boys ' Development , and the Culture of Manhood , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new understanding of girls . For two years the project has held a series of discussions and lectures , sponsored mothers-of-sons support groups , and designed research projects . The public interest in their work has taken the academics by surprise . " It 's almost more than we can handle , " Brawer said . <p> A few miles away in Newton , Mass. , psychologist William S. Pollack is also worrying about boys and writing a book about them . So are Michael Thompson and Dan Kindlon , also psychologists , and consultants to all-boys schools in the Boston area . Publishers have forked over six-figure advances for these books , due out later this year , hoping to replicate the financial bonanza of Mary Pipher 's bestseller on girls , " Reviving Ophelia . " <p> " We 've become very clear about what we want for girls , " Brawer said . " We are less clear about what we want for boys . " <p> ' Politically Incorrect ' <p> " It 's politically incorrect to be a boy , " says the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clumsy clods with smelly feet who care only about sports and mischief . They are seen as " toxic , " says Pollack , creatures " who will infect girls with some kind of social cooties . " But could it be they are just as much victims of gender stereotyping as girls have been ? As their sisters grow up with more options and opportunities than they used to have , boys may be feeling the tightening noose of limited expectations , societal scorn and inadequate role models . <p> " Why is there always a bad boy in every one of my classes , every year , but no bad girls ? " a second-grade girl asked Kindlon , who with Thompson is writing a book called " Raising Cain : Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys . " Thompson jokes that the subtitle of the book should really be " how to raise your son so he wo n't turn out like your husband . " <p> " Our beliefs about maleness , the mythology that surrounds being male , has led many boys to ruin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up for Manhood : Transforming the Lives of Boys in America . " " The image of male as strong is mixed with the image of male as violent . Male as virile gets confused with male as promiscuous . Male as adventurous equals male as reckless . Male as intelligent often gets mixed with male as arrogant , racist , and sexist . " <p> Said Pollack : " If girls were killing themselves in these numbers we 'd recognize this as a public health issue in our society . " <p> A survey on gender by The Washington Post , Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University showed that most parents feel they treat their sons and daughters equally . Still , most parents know that Jack will heedlessly jump off just about anything or pick up a block and make it a gun , while 4-year-old Jill insists on wearing her party dress and wrapping her toy animals in blankets . But while Jill can keep or abandon party dresses as she wishes Jack is often forbidden a toy gun , or he 's told repeatedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in Washington remembers his elementary school as a place without male teachers , where by sixth grade ( age 11 or 12 ) boys were assumed to be the troublemakers . One day a girl sitting next to him made him laugh by sticking a pencil up her nose . When the teacher reprimanded him , the boy blamed his friend and her pencil antics . But the girl denied doing anything  --  and the teacher believed her and not him . She sent him to sit in the hall for lying . <p> " That kind of thing happened all the time , " he said . " It made me not respect teachers very much . " <p> Barb Wilder-Smith is a Boston-area teacher who became interested in researching boys after she gave birth to two of them  --  and realized she did n't know much about them . Three years ago she took her then 5-year-old to buy a new bike . At the time , his favorite color was pink and he wanted a pink bike . She and her husband were content to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman said he could n't have a pink bike , pink was a girl color , and he had to have a red or blue bike , " Wilder-Smith said . " My son looked at him and said , ' That 's ridiculous , colors are n't boys or girls , and pink is my favorite color . ' " <p> The boy got his pink bike . But he was teased so much by other children , who called this 5-year-old gay , that he put a sign on his bicycle basket . It read : <p> I like pink . <p> I am still a boy . <p> I have a penis . <p> Now he is 8 , and does n't let anyone know he likes pink . It was the girls who hassled him about it most mercilessly . Girls who wear blue all the time . <p> Talking About Differences <p> Considerable trepidation surrounds this new interest in boys . Some parents are afraid that it 's about having their boys grow up " to be sweet and nice and good , " as Wilder-Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both genders worry that the hard-won changes that benefit girls will be pitted against newly defined needs of boys , and that the old canards about biology being destiny will come back from the near-dead . Some are resentful that attention is being directed toward boys when girls have had only " a nanosecond in the history of educational reform , " as Gabrielle Lange wrote in the American Association of University Women magazine Outlook . Researchers into boys ' behavior fear they will be tagged as anti-female , and they tread cautiously into the politically and emotionally loaded field of gender study . <p> " For 30 years it has been politically unacceptable to talk about neurological or biological differences , " said Thompson , who has worked as a clinical psychologist with both coed and all-boys schools . But now , he and others note , the scientific community seems more willing to acknowledge that there are differences between males and females . The question is what the significance of these differences is . <p> Diane F. Halpern , a psychology professor at California State University in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female intelligence . She found that women do better in tasks that test language abilities , fine motor tasks , perceptual speed , decoding nonverbal communication , and speech articulation . Men are superior in " visual working memory , " tasks that require moving objects , aiming , fluid reasoning , knowledge of math , science and geography , and general knowledge . At the same time males have more mental retardation , attention deficit disorders , delayed speech , dyslexia , stuttering , learning disabilities and emotional disturbances . <p> Girls ' brains are stronger in the left hemisphere , which is where language is processed , while boys ' are more oriented to the right hemisphere , the spatial and physical center . Recent advances in brain study have shown that the two hemispheres are better connected in females , which may eventually explain why the genders show different patterns in cognitive tests . <p> " Boys ' early experience of school is being beaten by girls at most things , " Thompson said . " The first thing we do in school is make them read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good at . " <p> Boys score better on achievement tests , but girls get better grades  --  another pattern that inspires all sorts of interpretations . Since boys are bigger risk-takers , perhaps they guess more on tests and by the law of averages get enough right answers . Halpern suggested that since most standardized tests are multiple choice , and female strength tends to be in writing , perhaps they lose out that way . Conversely , since sitting still , neatness and studiousness are rewarded in classroom grades , maybe boys are inadvertently penalized in that arena . It also has been demonstrated repeatedly that scores can change with the right training . <p> Boys and Learning <p> Why are so many more boys  --  six times more  --  diagnosed with learning disabilities ? No one knows for sure , but there are some theories . One is that the standards for diagnosing LD are so loose that disruptive boys are classified to get them to special help and out of the classroom . " The system has shaped the definition rather than the other way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities who teaches graduate school at the University of Iowa . <p> Douglas Fuchs , a professor at the Kennedy Center Institute on Education and Learning at Peabody College of Vanderbilt , thinks learning disabilities are over-diagnosed and may be related to early language differences . Millions of boys are now taking Ritalin to treat attention deficit and hyperactivity . <p> No one questions that many boys are legitimately learning disabled  --  neurologically mis-wired in ways that make traditional learning difficult . But there may be other factors that affect a boy 's ability to be successful in school . <p> Pollack 's theory , based on his years of research and clinical practice , is that many boys ' problems are rooted in a too-early separation from their mother 's nurturing . While boy babies start out with a wider emotional range  --  more sounds , expressions and wails  --  parents tend to give them less adoring interaction after about the age of 6 months , he says . Even though boy babies are more physically fragile , he believes that adults tend to think of them as being bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than try to understand their noise . Boys are so traumatized by this " disruption of their early holding environment " that they harden up and withdraw , which has repercussions for the rest of their lives , Pollack suggests . <p> Another question is whether we have failed to appreciate the language of boys because so much of it is either violent in imagery or oblique in approach . Wilder-Smith recalled getting a note from one of the 5-year-old boys whose fantasy play-acting she recorded for a year in a Boston school . <p> " Have a Hindenburg Exploding Life ! " the boy wrote . Wilder-Smith was n't sure at first if this note was meant affectionately ; after she thought about it she realized it was . It just was n't her kind of language . But she has come to believe that what appears to be violent play or imagery to a woman may be a valuable tool to a boy , his way of conquering fear and his smallness in the universe . Removing that outlet may end up making boys more violent rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the example of a Vermont farmer working on a broken tractor . His son may spend the day at his side , and yet they may exchange no more than a dozen words . But the son has seen a great deal  --  perseverance , problem solving ( or trying to ) , engine repair . " We 've lost a lot of that kind of communicating , " he says . <p> Boys exhibit different signs of depression , says Pollack , whose book " Real Boys : Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood " will be published later this year . Thus we often fail to recognize them because they are not as evident as the symptoms common to girls  --  who in adolescence and adulthood are diagnosed with depression at far higher rates than males . " Our view of depression has been feminized , " he said . " Boys may have a moody withdrawal rather than tears . " <p> After spending a year observing in a Boston public school , Wilder-Smith is among those who think we may need to reevaluate our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she suspects , the mothers and female teachers who statistically spend the most time with young boys believe that the key to producing a nonviolent adult is to remove all conflict  --  toy weapons , wrestling and shoving , imaginary explosions and crashes  --  from a boy 's life . <p> " I 've watched teachers who have the rule with creative writing that there 's ' no killing in stories , ' " she said . " One boy said , ' But the bad guy ! He has to die somehow ! ' Finally the teacher said the bad guy could die , and allowed him to be run over by a truck . . . . They ca n't draw it violence , they ca n't write about it , they ca n't act it out . " <p> " We do take away a lot of the opportunity to do things boys like to do , " said Carol Kennedy , a school principal in Missouri with 34 years ' experience in education . " That is be rowdy , run and jump and roll around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vivian Gussin Paley once put a running track in her kindergarten classroom . The girls ran around it in laps . The boys chased each other . They all seemed to like it . <p> Mass media ill-serve both genders , researchers say . Many believe that violence on television encourages aggressive behavior in boys and girls , but they have no conclusive proof of a connection . There is more evidence backed up by teachers that television has encouraged shorter attention spans and a need for artificial excitement . While girls are surrounded by television shows and books in which boys are almost always the protagonist , the hero and the main ingredient , boys rarely get a positive cultural message that it 's okay to be afraid or sad , to not be athletic , to have a girl for a friend , or to enjoy writing poetry . <p> New Pressures <p> It is no secret that modern life has produced a new style of childhood . But some aspects of contemporary life may exact particular hardships for boys that are rarely acknowledged by those in authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removes a boy 's primary role model from his daily life , it often brings additional burdens from his mother . He becomes the " man of the family , " a role he is generally not prepared to handle . School principals dealing with boys who are sent to their office with behavior problems are finding that many of them are in this situation . <p> " The responsibilities most of our young boys are having placed on them is different than ever before , " said principal Kennedy . " Mother is sharing things with that boy that almost makes him a partner rather than a son . . . . We find that even in elementary school , when a boy is taking on the role of being the major babysitter , he is often paying more attention to what happens at home than at school . It 's more of a boy problem because a mother can see the boy as head of household , or man of the family , and does n't tend to do that with a girl . " <p> Unsupervised play is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Researchers like Brawer suspect that while too many hours are being idled away alone , indoors , in front of a television set , too few are being spent outdoors in time-honored games of exploration , mock warfare , fort building , sneaking around , inventing ball games and so forth . Because many parents today are legitimately afraid of criminals and bad drivers careening down neighborhood streets , boys  --  and girls  --  are rarely allowed the freedom to investigate and master their home turf in a way that once provided a rehearsal for the real world . <p> So the questions mount . Brawer , who is writing a dissertation on Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder , notes that in the 1,700 studies on the subject that he has found , the word " father " is mentioned only three times . " The neurobiological crowd does n't believe in Freudian language , " he said . " But if you look at the conditions under which kids are more or less likely to have problems , the indicators go way down when the father is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> What messages do mothers inadvertently send when they recoil from their son 's wish to have a toy gun or his desire to be a ballerina for Halloween ? How do fathers restrict a boy 's emotional vocabulary when they say " big boys do n't cry " ? Should some boys , as Thompson and Kindlon suggest , start school at 8 rather than 5 or 6 years of age ? <p> " It may still be a man 's world , but it 's not a boy 's , " Pollack said . " He 's been sat on so long he 'll push to keep the dominance . Recognizing boys ' pain is the way to change society .
