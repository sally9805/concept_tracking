<p> It 's like walking through a haiku . It feels as well made as custom cabinetry , mortared and mitered and tight . These nearly six decades later , the cypress of its board-and-batten walls has turned a kind of gleaming butternut , so the effect is a little like being inside a jack-o ' - lantern . <p> And it 's about that big , too . <p> You wo n't find many closets in the Pope-Leighey House . Frank Lloyd Wright did n't believe in a lot of closets and storage space for the common man . Like Thoreau , like Jesus , he thought too many material possessions an unhealthy thing . It may have been the only thing he had in common with Jesus . <p> You wo n't find many nails in this miniature marvel ; the bulk of it is put together with wood screws . <p> There is one bathroom . There are two utilitarian bedrooms . There 's a carport . ( Did you know Wright invented the carport , believing garages too costly and unnecessary ? ) There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional Wrightian one-family houses , is properly referred to as " the workspace . " There 's a Lilliputian office or den , which is known as " the sanctum . " And of course there 's the epicenter of family life : the high-ceilinged living room with its plate-glass windows and great brick hearth and uncanny ventilating systems , with their signature geometric designs . It 's the one space in the house where everything soars , opens out onto nature . <p> Frank Lloyd Wright believed deeply in the hearth and family life , never mind his divorces , his celebrated infidelities . <p> This vest-pocket symphony of wood and brick and glass , its form so perfectly following function , is 1,200 square feet . Originally it had been planned for 1,800 square feet  --  but the Depression-era Washington newspaperman for whom it was designed could n't afford such vastness . In 1940-41 , when the house was being built , and when a lot of folks were convinced the thing would cave in on itself in the first snowfall , the cost to the owner was roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The flat-roofed L-shaped abode sits now , not on its original site , but about 16 miles away , in the elbow of a lovely hill at Woodlawn Plantation near Mount Vernon , having cheated death at least twice and outlived the bulldozers of Interstate 66 and all the naysayers of earlier , disbelieving times . <p> That it exists at all , able to be toured , able to be touched , has a lot to do with the faith and will of latter-day preservationists and of its second owner  --  but this fact has nothing to do with how and why it came into being in the first place . That is an even greater story of faith and will . <p> It came into being because of a six-page letter a $ 50-a-week , 29-year-old copy editor at the Washington Evening Star mailed on Aug. 18 , 1939 , to a world-famous architect at a world-famous place called Taliesin in Spring Green , Wis . <p> The letter writer was a husband and father who regarded himself as a New Deal liberal possessed of Thoreau-like impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved books , classical music , the outdoors . He saw something of his own face in Wright 's celebrated common-man ideal . And he was , like the visionary himself , a native Midwesterner , indeed a Wisconsinite . The newspaperman worked on his letter a long time , composing drafts during noon hours on long sheets of cheap white copy paper filched from his newspaper . These were his opening words : <p> " Dear Mr. Wright , There are certain things a man wants during life , and , of life . Material things and things of the spirit . The writer has one fervent wish that includes both . It is a house created by you . " <p> The letter went on for 10 more paragraphs . It was signed : " Sincerely , Loren Pope . " <p> The writer took it to his local post office in East Falls Church just off Lee Highway opposite the streetcar tracks . <p> Two weeks later came a buff envelope with a bright red chop and small black lettering . Inside was an opposite sort of missive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sentences , dead to the point , fewer than 40 words total . It was dated Sept. 2 , 1939 . It began : " Dear Loren Pope : Of course I am ready to give you a house . " It was signed : " Sincerely , Frank Lloyd Wright . " <p> How could the improbable dreamer , who opened that letter on that iconographic Washington morning 57 Septembers ago , have known what he was in for ? He would have never written a letter if he had known . <p> " Joyous fulfillment , " says an elderly man with hearing aids , sitting in warming winter refracted sunlight , having suddenly recovered his emotions . <p> " Unbearable grief . " <p> A Dream Design <p> The Gypsies have a curse : May your dreams come true . In some ways , that 's what this tale is about . But it is n't all that it 's about . There 's a warming twist . For if Loren Pope experienced the curse in the bitterest way , he was also determined to survive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . And the house , or at least the move there , had everything to do with it . <p> You look at the man , and somehow you instantly see the house , even though he has n't lived in the Pope-Leighey House for half a century . Like the house , he 's small and compactly made . But also like the house , there seems to be something deceptively sly and expansive about him . You get the unconventionality right off . You also get tinges of the Wrightian ego . <p> " Two years ago , I was doing 50 push-ups every morning , " he says . " Now I have some arthritis in my wrist and so only do 20 . " He walks three miles a day . He 'll be 87 in July . But the mind is mortared and tight . He has black horn-rims and bristly brows and long sideburns and great curls of flowing white hair . <p> He 's crouched on a sofa in his living room , as if set to spring . He 's got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really seems to have on is his curiosity . <p> His house is on a side street of Alexandria , most distinctive one on the block . It 's not a Wright house , but it 's beautiful . " Very Japanesey , " he says . " It 's sort of second-generation Wright . You could say I 've been aesthetically monogamous all my life . " The kitchen could hold about four kitchens of the Pope-Leighey design . Among other things , Pope is a gourmet cook . <p> His third wife is in the back room , reading . Her name 's Viola . They intend to take in a play this evening . <p> He has supported himself for many years as an educational consultant . He advises high school students and their parents on how to choose the right college . He 's got persnickety opinions , but he 's fine company . <p> He 's trying to pinpoint when the name " Frank Lloyd Wright " first entered his consciousness . Probably one day at lunch in the mid- ' 30s , courtesy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was before he found work at the Evening Star . ( Before the Star , the city 's dominant afternoon daily , he 'd stopped for a cup of coffee at The Washington Post ; he was on the copy desk in the sports department . ) <p> Then , in January 1938 , the journalist saw Frank Lloyd Wright 's picture staring off the cover of Time . Inside was a lengthy piece about an architect who had been internationally famous since at least 1910 but who was still largely ignored by the conventional architectural world ; who 'd developed the low-slung Prairie style of houses in the Midwest ; who 'd built the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo ; who 'd just completed a work of genius and audacity called Fallingwater , which was a residence cantilevered in concrete slabs over a waterfall in western Pennsylvania . <p> The article also told of Wright 's belief in " Usonia . " It was his name for the U.S.A. , and he 'd taken it from the writings of Samuel Butler . The word represented his utopian vision of affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . The Usonian house , the article said , quoting Wright , " may help to indicate how stifling the little colonial hot-boxes , whether hallowed by government or not , really are . " <p> After that , Pope remembers going to the library and getting out Wright 's autobiography . It 's titled " Autobiography . " Pope : " I read the first chapter three times . I read the second chapter three times . And then I read the third chapter three times . By then it was past my bedtime , and the next day I went to Brentano 's and got my own copy . " <p> He still has his original hardback ; the clothbound cover has gone soft as a family Bible . <p> " I mean , that was Holy Writ to me . Is there a stronger word than seduction ? " <p> So a bargain was struck . So some architectural renderings were begun . <p> A Home Takes Shape <p> On the hallway walls of Loren Pope 's home , beautifully framed , are letters from Frank Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to get a sense of some of the heartache that had to be endured before the little house in East Falls Church got built . You also get a sense of the friendship that grew between two like-minded men outside the mainstream . <p> Nov. 28 , 1939 : " Dear Loren : Plans herewith with thanks for the check , articles and everything . I hope we come out as well as we begin . " <p> The copy editor earning $ 50 a week could secure no mortgage from any of the local lending institutions . At the Arlington/Fairfax Building and Loan Association , they tried not to hide their laughter . " A man there told me , ' Loren , this house would be a white elephant . ' " <p> The plans were absurd : three-inch no-stud " sandwich " walls to be screwed into a plywood core . Heating pipes to be encased beneath the red slab concrete flooring . Colleagues at the Evening Star would see him coming down the hall and start talking about " the hot-foot principle . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original letter ( by now he 'd made his own pilgrimage to Taliesin and had come to know Wright personally , and had even slept in a room beneath the seer 's bedroom ) , Pope secured a $ 5,700 construction loan from his employer . The loan was to be repaid at the rate of $ 12 a week taken out of his wage envelope . He believed that free men ought not to be encumbered by loans from their employers , but he had nowhere to turn . <p> Gordon O. Chadwick , a Taliesin apprentice , arrived in suburban Virginia to begin taking bids . <p> From Wright , July 9 , 1940 : " Dear Loren : This placing of the house is much better orientation with sunlight and a less formal attitude  --  throughout . More our stuff , I believe . The garden can be stepped down . " <p> The great day came . The family moved in . It was March 1941 . The Popes had one small child . His name was Ned . He was 3 . Another child was due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on May 17 , 1941 , Ned Pope drowned in a neighbor 's pond a short distance from the house . <p> A Foundation Cracks <p> An old man is still hunched forward on the sofa . Winter sunlight is still warming the room . " Well , that was my day off . I was walking outside , digging on something . He just sort of got away . I was n't paying attention , I guess . " <p> He begins to square the edges of some stacked books on his coffee table . One of the books is titled " A Natural History of the Senses . " Another is titled " Emerson : The Mind on Fire . " <p> " Let 's see . How can I talk about this ? I have n't cried recently . I have n't cried for the last three or four years . I 'm not sure why . Ned . What can I say ? He was a lovely kid . Sweet and bright child . <p> " It was such a small pond  --  if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . <p> " I blame myself for his going down there . <p> " I just instinctively ran to the pond . I was the one who found him . " <p> Later he tells you : " I used to be driving home and see a telephone pole up ahead and just think I could plow right into it and end it all . " <p> The child was cremated . <p> Did the death change everything about the house ? Yes and no . The family stayed for another five years . Two more children were born , first a son and then a daughter . ( The second son was born within two months of the drowning , and this was a godsend . ) It 's true the Popes eventually needed more room and felt they had outgrown the house  --  this seems part of the explanation . But every history of unbearable grief is so layered and tangled , and probably not even now can Loren Pope make any real sense of what happened . Or why . <p> In November 1946 , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 100 prospective buyers . They sold the dream in about two weeks . " We sold it to the couple we thought would love it most . " Their names were Robert and Marjorie Leighey . <p> The Popes did n't have a lot to pack . A free-thinking man , who 'd always had a restless bone , he had the idea that he 'd make a clean break and become a freelance writer out in Loudoun County . He 'd subsidize the writing by raising Landrace hogs . And when enough hogs had been taken to market , and enough articles had been sold to magazines , he 'd again enlist the genius from Taliesin to design him " a pleasure palace in the country . " <p> Pause . " It was a fantasy . " <p> Well , they did move to a farm in Loudoun County . He did raise some hogs . He did till some fields and he did sell some articles . But eventually he needed money and he came back to the news business . He worked several places , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times . After the Times he and his family relocated to Oakland University in Michigan , where he worked as an administrator . <p> There were long years when he thought he was done with the house in East Falls Church . <p> His first marriage of many years collapsed . His second marriage did , too . His second son grew up to an extremely troubled life , says his father . There were long years when the Pope family had seemed to cave in on itself . <p> Last year , Loren Pope wrote : " To me , this edifice with three lives is much more than a house . I have been away from it more than I 've been in it , but spiritually I never left . It represented life across the spectrum . " <p> Out of Harm 's Way <p> Three lives . The conjoining of a house that did n't die and the tale of a man who did n't let tragedy destroy him takes a brief swerve here . As Loren Pope has said on many public occasions : Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leighey 's generosity in particular  --  there today would be no house for Wright-lovers in Washington to enjoy . Pope has often spoken of Mrs. Leighey as " the true heroine of the piece . " She is deceased now , as is her husband . <p> The Leigheys lived in the house for almost 20 years . In late 1963 , the Virginia highway department announced its intention to seize the property under eminent domain for the construction of what was to become I-66 . <p> Robert Leighey had recently died . In July 1964 , Marjorie Leighey signed a contract with the National Trust for Historic Preservation , in which she agreed to donate the house , its contents and the entire $ 31,500 condemnation fee to the trust in return for its guarantee to save it . The story gets a little complicated here , but the essence of it is that through the efforts of many people and organizations , including the Interior Department , the Usonian dream of Frank Lloyd Wright got moved out of the wrecking ball 's path . <p> They dismantled the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plantation where George and Martha Washington 's granddaughter , Nelly Parke Custis Lewis , had lived in the early 1800s . In June 1965 , at the dedication ceremonies , Interior Secretary Stewart Udall said : " Now , as men and women of the centuries to come visit this historic place , they may entertain thoughts of two men  --  George Washington and Frank Lloyd Wright  --  who were in quite different ways Founding Fathers . " The cost of dismantling and rebuilding was $ 48,000 . <p> Inadvertently , the house had been set on a belt of marine clay at Woodlawn . At length the base began to warp and crack . There was nothing to do but take apart a jewel once more . In 1995 , the ingenious American residence with such a troubled history underwent another disassembly . The preservationists turned it and moved it about 30 feet . According to the curator at Woodlawn , the cost of the latest restoration of what was once a $ 7,000 house totaled about $ 750,000 . Frank Lloyd Wright must be hooting in Heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must perversely and constantly inflate himself . <p> Last June 8 , in commemoration of the 129th anniversary of Wright 's birth , the house was reopened to the public . Pope is on the council that administers Woodlawn , and enjoys making himself available to give tours to foreign architects . Like an old man with stubborn insides , the Pope-Leighey House has survived what was threatening to crack it apart . <p> That old man is squaring stacked books on his coffee table . <p> " For a long time it was pretty painful to go back there . Ned . Of course Ned . Oh , it was pain and grief together . I 'd remember what it was like when we first moved in , all that joy . And then I 'd remember  --  " <p> He almost cried , saying this part . But he did n't . <p> Home Again <p> He 's at the Pope-Leighey House . It 's mid-afternoon and he 's been talking for almost four hours . He is giving a private tour . <p> " I remember once Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't offer you much . Will you please stay for dinner ? ' " They had an egg dish . Wright was charming and gregarious , though certainly an egoist . Pope : " He knew who he was , and there was no arguing it . " <p> He walks up to the carport opposite the semi-concealed front door . " Our Studebaker Champion was right here ! " <p> In the kitchen he puts his hand on a free-standing cabinet . " I made this piece of furniture . Mr. Wright approved of it . " He made several pieces of furniture for the house . Mr. Wright approved . <p> " My daughter 's high chair was there . " He brushes his hand over a hulky black rotary phone . " My son , Loren  --  that was the child born after Ned  --  would pick it up occasionally . If he got there first , he 'd always say , ' Newsroom . ' " He goes over to a glass door that opens onto the brick patio . " We left these doors open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees up from the woods down there . " It is a memory slip , a time bend , for the woods were n't here , of course . They were in East Falls Church . <p> On the way back up the drive , Loren Pope says quietly : " I used to have nightmares I might never have another Wright house . Well , I did n't . But I came back to this one . " <p> Then a free man , 10 years younger than this century , says : " You never know how the fabric of your life will work out . "
