For many who suffer from chronic schizophrenia , the drug clozapine seems to work miracles . One woman who thought she was God and could control the weather was in and out of mental institutions 35 times before starting on the antipsychotic drug .

Clozapine , approved by the Food and Drug Administration in February , could benefit an estimated 100,000 people in the U.S. <P> But the patients who need the drug most face a huge barrier : treatment costs nearly $9,000 a year . The drug is a patented product , available in the U.S. under the brand name Clozaril only from New Jersey-based Sandoz Pharmaceuticals , a subsidiary of Sandoz International of Basel , Switzerland .

To address the safety question , the FDA ruled that Sandoz must devise a blood-monitoring system that would spot early signs of the fatal complication .
