From faculty lounges to garrets to the watering holes of writers across the nation , the unsettling news spread that the script for Bob Dole 's best speech ever , his not-a-dry-eye , " White House or home " abdication address , was the work of a Wall Street Journal columnist listed as Mark Helprin . Come again ? The Helprin known by starving artists and threadbare assistant professors of English is , after all , an aesthete hatched at the New Yorker and renowned as the writer of eloquent , rarefied novels . And as a tormentor of reporters , who in his early years invented an ever changing , operatic past in which to luxuriate . One tall tale had his father refusing to let Helprin eat supper until , standing at attention , he had told a satisfactory original story . <P> Helprin 's novels are not clearly political and at their most florid are , though much admired , in fact not clear in any direction . Winter 's Tale , for instance , is an obscure and very long fantasy about an annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case , is marvelous , brilliantly written bosh about an elderly maniac who fulminates obsessively against coffee . Coffee ? Sure . You see ... <P> But Helprin , it turns out , is also a conservative political columnist . He has expostulated for the Wall Street Journal off and on since 1985 , in style and tone closer to Rush Limbaugh than George Will . As a contributing editor to the Journal in 1992 , he evaluated the man now running as the party 's candidate : " Senator Bob Dole , the grand old rhinoceros of the G.O.P. , is in his fury and in his wisdom a natural for the presidency , but by the time he assumed it , he would be 73 years of age . " Depending on how you feel about rhinoceroses , that could have been an endorsement . <P> In any case , Helprin scolded the Clintons with harrumphing indignation . Hillary irked him even more than the President did , and he sniffed about " the White House ' Hillarys '  --  Highly Inexperienced Left-Liberal Academic Righteous Yuppies . " Helprin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those he saved for his novels . " Now that the bloom is off the rose , the White House oracles are thumping their naked tails in unison to protest that Whitewater is political , " he wrote . <P> Ouch . Block that bloomless rose . But among subsequent columns was one in February titled " Let Dole Lead . " Helprin recommended there that Dole , the wily legislative fox , drive Clinton bonkers with bills he would look bad vetoing . By this time the G.O.P. 's future was in danger and whether it was lost was pretty much up to the old rhinoceros . Dole read the column and liked it . In April he met with Helprin , an aloof , inscrutable character who lives on a 200-acre farm in New York 's Hudson Valley , and Helprin became the first person in years to give voice to another aloof , inscrutable character . Getting the resignation speech right for the brusque rhythms of the majority leader took a dozen sessions of phone editing . Dole would read a passage , then grump , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that . " Out went Helprin 's flower arrangements , but what was left rang true .
