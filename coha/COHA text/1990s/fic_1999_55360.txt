Murphy calls , says he wants to meet me down at the Chagrin River after work . " Fish and talk , " he says . I can hear machines in the background , people shouting . <p> " When 's after work ? " <p> " Punching the clock now , " he says . <p> " And ? " <p> " And I have a favor to ask . " <p> I hang up , give the radio ten minutes to play something good . Then I leave . <p> On the way I buy a bottle of Dickel white label and a sack of crushed ice , even though I 'm trying to taper back a bit . <p> In the parking lot , I wait , engine on , radio off , staring at the crisp paper seal on the bottle . The Chagrin River flows through the exposed shale valley on its way to Lake Erie . The water is full of poison . Nobody eats the fish anymore , not even the homeless who camp out under the bridge in summer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this town wear tweed sports jackets and high-top sneakers with duct tape on them . Sometimes at night I see them standing alongside the road scrounging for returnables . <p> I watch as cottonwood blossoms drift out into the brown river and stick in the current . Behind me , under a large green-shingled pavilion , city workers are installing the Frontier Days signs , pounding in log posts and tree trunks for the musket sharpshooting contest and axe throw . <p> Then I see Murphy 's van pull in . <p> I wave and grab my rod out of the truck bed , reach into the cab , and tuck the bottle into the bait bucket . He nods and gets out . <p> We walk to the river . " How 's the factory ? " I ask . <p> Murphy cocks his good ear toward me  --  eighteen years at the same press , and he 's deaf in his machine-side ear . He 's got gray skin , thin sand-colored hair , and a bright red face that makes him look angry all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I point at the bottle . He does n't say anything , just looks at my hands to see if they 're shaking . Steady as a rock . <p> We go to the concrete embankment that overlooks the dam and set our gear down . He runs a worm on a hook , and I do the same , before we drop our lines into the foam . With the poles propped against a rusty girder , we let the sound of the river breaking over the dam fill us . <p> Ten minutes later I show Murphy the bottle . He breaks the seal and pours the whiskey into two coffee mugs . <p> I 'm trying to quit , you see . <p> Murphy knows this , says it 's a good idea , but wo n't tell me I should n't have one with him . He works  --  knows how it is , how a little sip or two takes the edge off , rounds off the day . <p> I 've done the meeting thing , listened while some ex-drunk recounts his life story with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes they make me wear a name tag when I 'm looking jammed up . Afterwards when everybody herds together to shake hands , hug , and stack fold-up chairs , I just stand back against the wall until one of the old-timers shuffles over to me , slings an arm over my shoulder , and asks me to join in . All the touching and goodwill makes me want to jump out of my skin , especially when they tell me how I got ta fight the good fight and count the days . <p> I work alone and do n't go out much . I fish and brood . <p> Murphy grabs his rod a minute and then sets it back down . <p> " Thought I had a nibble , " he says , sipping from the mug . " Thanks for coming , last minute and all . " <p> I wave him off . <p> " This is good , " I say . <p> And it is . Even the river looks nice . Not like the fall coho run when the river is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until Murphy looks the other way before taking the first sip . <p> He turns back around , and I hit him with a question , so he wo n't start on me about meetings and how he 's happy I 'm making the effort . <p> " How 's Jeff ? " I ask . <p> Murphy nods . It 's the same nod ever since Jeff head-on-ed a telephone pole on Lost Nation Road three years ago . He was drunk , just coming home after making last call at Delaney 's Sunset Inn . There was black ice . He hit the brakes and took out some mailboxes , before the telephone pole . They pried him out of the car . The police said he was going twenty over the limit and that he was lucky to be alive . But there was a closed head injury-one of those wait-and-see things , and he hovered in a coma for a week . When he came out of it , Murphy called me from the hospital to say things were looking up and asked if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bleeding did a number on his brain . Doctors filtered in and out of the room . One of them looked at me and said something about God rolling the dice , and I wanted to smash his white teeth . <p> Jeff got fat after the accident . His hair grew back in wild white and brown patches where they 'd stitched him . During the day Jeff watched television and stared out the window as cars passed by . <p> " They got him on new pills . Big as my thumb , " Murphy says , flipping his worm into the current , where it disappears alongside mine . " And they had a nurse come out to the house to tell me I have to put him on a better diet . " <p> " Better diet ? " <p> " More fiber . Less fat . They want him to live to be a hundred . " <p> Down river a couple of teenagers dressed in rotten sneakers and cutoffs start skipping rocks at a flock of ducks . Their laughter echoes off the shale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a noisy family picnic happening under the cottonwoods . And it 's a family photo : Dad doing battle with the yellow jackets , while Mom watches her three children run along the tops of the picnic tables throwing water at each other from red plastic cups . <p> " What 's the favor ? " I ask . For a minute I think he 's going to ask how my meetings have been going , and I steady my hands against the concrete . <p> He clears his throat and fiddles with the drag setting on his reel . " Well , Jeff saw one of them stupid ads on the television for Frontier Days . They got these spots with a bunch of guys running around the woods in buckskin pants and long rifles . They 're on during the Tribe games . In between innings  --  you 've seen them . " <p> " I guess I have n't , " I say . <p> " Well , Jeff likes them , " he says . " Keeps telling me how he wants to go , wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I thought the mayor nixed the buffaloes this year . " <p> " I do n't think so , " he says . " Anyway . I 've got to work this Saturday . " <p> Just then one of the kids from the picnic table approaches the embankment and tosses a hot dog into the water . The hot dog eddies in the current before sinking and leaving an oily trail of mustard floating on the water . The father murmurs an apology , but Murphy waves him off . <p> " Ca n't you call in sick ? " I ask . <p> Murphy shakes his head and checks his line . Most of his worm has been nibbled off . <p> " We 're short as it is . Betty Brownlow quit and got married . Ca n't get the God squaders to work the weekends , and foreman Frank 's pissing and moaning about meeting some deadline . Hell , I promised them . " <p> " So you need me ... , " I start . <p> " I would n't ever ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands tremble as I watch Murphy bait his hook again . <p> " I 'll have to put off a little job I got going , " I lie . <p> Murphy licks his lips and runs his fingers through his thinning hair then . " I know it 's a lot to ask , " he says , " but he 's got it in his head to see a live buffalo . It would mean a lot to him . " <p> " No problem , " I say . " Does he remember me ? " <p> " Sure he does , " Murphy says excitedly . " Just do n't touch him , remember that . " <p> " You sure about this ? " <p> " You 'd be doing me one big favor , " he says . <p> I do n't say a word . The river hisses and snakes around logs and rocks , kids scream in the distance , and after a few minutes it 's just us fishing again , and everything is normal . Then the sun starts to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that I do n't dare have another drink in front of Murphy . So I fill his mug , screw the cap back on the bottle , and tuck it into the bucket where I ca n't see it . <p> " You can pick him up in the morning , " Murphy says . <p> " No problem , " I say , pulling my line against the current and then letting it drift free for a moment before it thuds to a stop . <p> When Saturday rolls around , I have n't had a drop in three days . My face feels like it wants to peel off . My hands hurt . I pull on my clothes and stir together breakfast . Murphy calls me from the plant . I can hear the presses in the background . He has to shout . Says he wants to remind me that Jeff knows I 'm coming and that it was all he could talk about last night . He tries to thank me again , and I tell him to forget it , that it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a promise and all that . <p> The last time I went to Frontier Days was with this woman named Marie who got drunk on peach schnapps and threw up on the Roto-Twirl . I was out of work then and crazy from sitting around on my hands , waiting for the phone to ring . I never saw her again . Then I got work and was too busy to even think about her , just the money fluttering in from the jobs and the promise of a drink after the tools were put away . I had life in a box . There was no future , just each day , one at a time . I started kicking things around , looking at my options , like some sort of high noon of the soul . Instead of charting a course I spent a lot of time deciding what I did n't want to be , drinking toasts to this and that , getting by . But then nothing happened . I am still a carpenter , still waiting . <p> At the meetings this old guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me stories about how he helped build city hall back when they did all the figuring in their heads . He says he used to drink two bottles of beer after work and felt good about where his life was going . Then it was six , and from there it was a hop , skip , and a jump to twelve and the bottle . He asks me if I keep count . I pretend not to hear . <p> I drive over to Murphy 's . It is a small two-bedroom bungalow with a nice dogwood tree in the front yard . The only evidence of his ex-wife , Katrina , are a few patches of flowers left over from her sudden gardening binges . Since her departure Murphy has managed to neglect or mow over most of the once burgeoning flowerbeds , leaving only a few yellow daylilies and anemic gladiolas . <p> I ring the bell and wait until the door swings open . Jeff stands behind the glass storm door , staring at me blankly for a moment like a bank teller . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else has combed it . I wave , and he smiles before opening the door . I forget and extend a hand for him to shake . He looks at me and puts his hand behind his back . <p> " Can I go now ? " he asks . He shuffles closer . " Dad says I go see buffalo right now . " <p> " Sure , " I say . <p> " Right now . " <p> His brown eyes , still crusted with sleep , stare at my mouth and then at my hands . Not so steady with those three days . I get nervous and clap a few times and tell him to saddle up . He jumps up and down , patting his hair down and shifting his weight from side to side . <p> He settles and then goes to the door , opens it carefully , and peers outside , as if snipers are waiting for him . <p> I point at the truck . " You still want to go ? " I ask , hoping he 'll shake his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Favor refused . But I 've already sunk three days into this for Murphy , so I point at the truck again . <p> " Sure , yeah , " he slurs . " Very cool , very cool  --  I go . " <p> I step out into the sunlight and head toward the truck . <p> I buckle his seat belt for him . He stiffens when I touch him and sits staring out through the windshield as if he 's remembering his accident all over again . Then I show him how the radio works . He punches the buttons from station to station . " I like them all now , " he says , his voice flat and spooky . Before the accident , he was just another young thug , learning to drink and lie , generally up to no good with no strong feeling either way on criminal behavior . And now he 's got nurses coming over , feeding him pills , talking about his diet . <p> I let him roll down the window and stick his head out like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a moment he 's pure joy . Suddenly he pulls his head inside . A large wasp is tangled in his hair . It flexes its wings a minute before shooting out the window to freedom . <p> " We 're going to Frontier Days , " I say , trying to put some party in the line . <p> " Dad told me . Buffalo , they going to shoot the buffalo , and I 'm gon na watch . " <p> " They wo n't shoot the buffalo , " I say . " They 're for people to look at . " <p> My hands are shaking again , and I 'm talking too loud . <p> " You say , whatever , " he says as we dip into the river valley and turn off at the Daniel 's Park sign . A huge banner that reads frontier days has been strung across two elm trees . Jeff stops punching the radio button and stares at the banner as a policeman in an orange vest points his flashlight , directing us down a dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waddle by armed with fold-up lawn chairs and coolers . Groups of children scurry past the truck carrying unlit sparklers and miniature American flags in tight pink fists . Jeff watches the people , and I wait for something to come across his face , a smile or frown . Nothing . <p> We park . Jeff stretches and stares at the sun . Off in the distance I can hear the echo of gunshots and cheers . A fat man in a buckskin jacket crashes out of a blue Port-a-John , buckling his pants . Jeff stops stretching and stares . <p> " Davy fucking Crockett , " he says , pointing . <p> The man glares at us , his eyes full of beer and maybe too many hours of work . He 's got hands like a welder and one of those I-ride-a-Harley beards . <p> " Problem ? " he says to Jeff . <p> Jeff freezes , crazy smile plastered across his face . <p> " He 's ... , " I start . <p> The man nods . " I understand , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers and shoots the man in the back , laughs , and then falls silent again . He wanders over to the river and stands there on the muddy bank , head bowed . <p> That 's when I start looking for the bright blue and yellow of the beer garden tent . <p> " We can come back and look at the water later , " I say , hoping he does n't jump in after something and drown . <p> He gapes at me , and for a moment I realize he has no clue who I am  --  just this guy hustling him away from the river to get to some beer . <p> I walk back up through the crowd , and he follows me to the beer tent . I buy a string of tickets and order a beer , sip off the warm foam , and give Jeff two tickets . He carefully takes them without touching my hand and orders a Coke . He gulps it down and burps loudly . The counter girl looks at me and smiles . She has hickeys on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow face . <p> " More , " Jeff says . She pours him another , less ice this time . He drinks it down and leaves . <p> We move through the crowd . Nobody steps in front of Jeff . One look at his checked-out expression , and people move the other way and whisper . <p> Jeff follows the gunshots and comes to a small field lined with a brown snow fence . The air is thick with black powder and wet grass . Families sit on wool blankets and lawn chairs . The children watch as men and women dressed like pathfinders load muskets on rickety plywood tables . A chubby woman in an old-fashioned lace dress stands on a riser , waving her handkerchief at the shooters . <p> " Gentlemen , " she says . " Load your weapons . " <p> Two old-timers dressed in pinstriped shirts and derby hats stand near the targets , ready to tally scores on a marker board . Jeff gawks at the guns a minute before making his way to the front of the crowd , yelling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , apologizing in his wake , knowing there 's not enough beer in the world to make this any easier . <p> Somebody whoops and throws an empty beer cup onto the field as the rifles fire and gray-blue smoke drifts out over the crowd . The old-timers go to the targets and dig around with pencils and yell out who hit what . <p> When I catch up to Jeff , he is pressed up against the yellow divider rope and snow fence , watching the men in buckskin slip ramrods down into their rifles . A woman dressed in a coonskin cap and shooting gloves with long ribbons of brown fringe looks at us and says , " Howdy . " <p> Jeff says howdy back , just long and flat enough for her to suspect that something 's wrong . She looks at me like I 'm his father and smiles politely before loading her gun . <p> " Shoot , " Jeff yells . He laughs and pats his hair . <p> A little girl dressed in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt and yellow shorts points at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother leans over and tells her to eat the melon and not to play with it . The girl stomps her feet and throws the wedge of melon on the ground . Jeff stares at the melon in the dirt until the crack of rifles breaks his attention . <p> We watch the contest . Lady Buckskin hits a bull's-eye and bows to the crowd , blowing kisses . Two other men take aim with mirrors over their shoulders and fire . Afterwards , they hold the mirrors up to the crowd . Jeff cranes his neck to see himself in the mirror , pushing his belly tight against the rope as I drain the rest of my beer . <p> This is easy , I tell myself . <p> Just as I start thinking about another beer , the little girl in the Mickey Mouse T-shirt approaches Jeff again and taps him on the knee . He freezes and starts yelling , " Hot , hot , hot , hot ! " His arms shoot down to his sides , and the girl runs away crying . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I give her some parental shorthand that tells her Jeff is not right . <p> Jeff stops screaming when the lady in the dress calls out for the shooters to shoot and the loaders to load . I think about Murphy punching the button on his press , worrying about Jeff and sweating the time clock . <p> " Want another Coke ? " I ask Jeff . He nods and begins walking toward the beer tent , yelling " Excuse me " loud enough to shake up this old couple having a go at some cotton candy . <p> We make the beer tent and stand in line . Jeff rocks back and forth , one foot then the other , humming . <p> A woman bumps into me from behind . I turn around and look into eyes so brown my heart stops beating for a minute and my throat goes dry . She has long hair the color of fresh asphalt and slight bags under her eyes , which make her look tired and sexy . <p> " Sorry , " she says , placing a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breath and try peeking down the front of her white muscle T-shirt . There 's nobody with her , and I start thinking about getting lucky when Jeff turns around and burps at us . <p> She laughs . <p> " Yours ? " she asks , tapping an empty beer cup against her hips . <p> " Sort of and not really , " I tell her . <p> She bites her lower lip and laughs again . " Which is it ? " <p> " I 'm doing a favor for my buddy . " I lean into her so Jeff ca n't hear . " He was in an accident . Scrambled him some . " <p> She nods and looks at me over her empty beer glass . <p> " You want another one ? " I ask . <p> " If you 're buying , " she says . <p> " All day , " I say , showing her my string of tickets . <p> " You bet . " <p> Jeff sees the tickets . " Ooh , " he says , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You look familiar . You ever go to meetings ? " <p> " Depends what kind , " I say . " And who 's asking . " <p> " Wanda , " she says . " And you know what I 'm talking about . " <p> I nod . " I go sometimes . " <p> " I thought I recognized you , " she says . <p> " My name 's Dan , " I say , extending a hand for her to shake . <p> " We 're not supposed to be doing this , " she says , pointing at the beer glasses . " But my divorce papers just came through , and I live just up the street , and you know what ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " I got tired of hearing the people having fun . It was making me sad . It was either this or listen to music all by myself and get depressed then spend the night looking for a meeting . So I said what the hell  --  how many times you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . " <p> We watch Jeff order another Coke . He carefully places two tickets on the counter and jerks his hand away before pointing at the soda machine . <p> " How come you never talk at the meetings ? " Wanda asks . " Me , I just let it all out , and I do n't give a damn what they think . " <p> " I do n't really have a problem , " I say . <p> " Sure , " she says . " Neither do I. I just like going to meetings in smoky basements . " <p> " It 's not like that . " <p> " Do n't worry , I wo n't tell . Me  --  I 'm kissing three months goodbye , and I 've never felt better . What 's the longest for you ? " <p> " I already told you it 's not like that . " <p> " We can play that game . " <p> " Deal , " I say . <p> She pauses , rolls her eyes , and I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk more at the meetings , " she says . " People are beginning to wonder about you . " <p> " That 's okay with me . " <p> " The mystery man , " she says , shaking her hair . <p> I buy her another beer , and when I turn around to hand it to her , she says , " Your friend  --  he just walked off . " <p> I search the crowd looking for his slump shoulders and crazy hair , and it 's as if he 's vanished . <p> " Did you see where he went ? " I ask , trying not to panic . <p> " He took off that way when you were n't looking . C'm on , we 'll find him , " she says , taking my hand and leading me through the crowd . <p> We check the axe and hatchet throw , the midway . No Jeff . I start thinking about Murphy and begin jogging . Wanda follows , apologizing as I race over to the corn-roasting pit . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices blur into a beery chowder as game tenders yell out for suckers  --  Three Darts Three Balloon One Buck , Dunk the Clown , Guess Your Weight . <p> We walk back to the river , and still no Jeff . Wanda glances at me , and I can see the fear registering in her eyes , making her sober . <p> " This was n't supposed to happen . I 'm responsible for him . I promised his father . " <p> " Maybe he went back to the car ? " <p> " Where are the buffalo ? " I ask her . <p> " Over there , " she says , lifting a few damp strands of hair from her neck . <p> I take her hand and lead her through the crowd . Overhead , the Tilt-a-Whirl casts a band-shaped shadow across the trampled grass . <p> We smell them first , a sun-baked stew of wet carpet , dead dog , and buffalo shit . Several people rush past us with worried looks on their faces . When I hear one of them say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my lungs . <p> Wanda sees him first . She gasps and points at a group of rent-a-cops and a police officer circling a small herd of dusty-looking buffalo . One of the officers has his revolver drawn while the rent-a-cops brandish flashlights . More people dash by , others point cameras at the spectacle . <p> Then I see Jeff , standing inside the pen surrounded by the animals , his red Cleveland Indians T-shirt visible against the dirty brown fur . A man dressed in buckskins talks through a bullhorn at Jeff , his words breaking in choppy amplified waves I ca n't make out . <p> I push my way to the front of the crowd and see Jeff waving his arms , as if he is orchestrating some private dance with the buffalo as they mill around him . I hop the fence and pull Wanda over . Her shorts catch on a stave iron and tear . <p> " Shit , " she says , dark , sweaty hair cascading around her face as she steadies herself against me . " Just my luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . <p> A rent-a-cop intercepts us and points a heavy steel flashlight at my chest like a gun . " Please remain behind the fence , " he says . <p> " His name 's Jeff , " I tell him . <p> Wanda nods and grabs my hand , lacing her fingers through mine and squeezing . The rent-a-cop lowers the flashlight , his hands shaking slightly . <p> " Are you with him ? " the rent-a-cop asks , pointing out to the animals . <p> " He 's not right , " I say . <p> " What was your first clue ? " he says . Sweat boils out of his pores , running down his neck and soaking his tight collar . <p> I glare at him and clench my jaw . <p> " I 'm sorry , " he stammers , tossing his hands into the air . " It 's just we 've got a real situation here . " <p> One of the police officers steps away from the ring of onlookers and approaches us . " You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face is webbed with broken vessels , and his nose looks as if it has been broken more than a few times . <p> I nod . " He 's with me . " <p> He squints . " Well , he started yelling , said he was going to shoot or something . We think maybe he 's got a gun . " <p> " He does n't have a gun , " I say , tightly . <p> " I do n't want to be the one to find out , " the officer says . " And I do n't want to get stampeded or anyone else for that matter . " <p> " He just wants to see the animals . " <p> " Yeah , but that do n't fix our problem now , does it ? He gets himself hurt , the city 's liable . Are you gon na take responsibility for that ? " <p> " I 'll get him , " I say . <p> " As long as nobody gets hurt , " he says . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids . " <p> I walk out to where the buffalo are pinched into a tight herd . All the grass has been worn away from their hooves . The noise of the crowd drops away like I 'm in some sort of box . Jeff sees me coming and starts waving . <p> When I 'm near the outside edge of the herd , I put my hands out in front of me and close my eyes . I wait until the ground stops shaking before opening my eyes . Three feet in front of me stands one of the larger buffalo . It shakes its mane and stomps , causing the whole herd to shift about nervously . I take a few more steps , figuring there are only two ways to come out of this mess : dead or injured . <p> I move slowly , touching the animals on the sides , guiding them away from me until one of them leans its rump into me and I can feel every muscle in its body quiver . <p> Jeff wades farther into the brown mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them lower their horns as I pass by , touching their dirty flanks . I glance over my shoulder to find Wanda , but I ca n't pick her out of the crowd . <p> When I get within ten feet of Jeff , a pair of buffalo step in front of me and lower their shaggy heads as if they are protecting him from my advance . <p> " Go now , " Jeff says , patting an animal on the back as it leans into him . I edge around to the other side , and again the animals react and block my path . <p> " Do n't shoot them , " Jeff says . <p> " It 's Dan , " I say . " Nobody 's going to shoot anything . " <p> He shakes his head , and one of the animals starts licking his leg . Jeff 's face lights into a grin , and suddenly I see how delicate the whole thing is , how maybe he moves too fast or hits one of them and the whole herd charges the fences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . <p> But he does n't . <p> He lets the animal lick him , and I work my way through the last wall of animals until I am standing beside him . <p> " Steady , " I say . Jeff looks at me and shakes his head . I can hear the crowd now . Little children screaming and pointing ; drunks yelling out advice . I shut my ears and put out a hand for Jeff . The buffalo at his side stops licking and looks at me . Jeff stares at my hand . I hold my breath and inch toward him as if I 'm going after somebody stuck in the ice . The breeze picks up and lifts the stink of animals away for a moment , allowing the scent of warm summer river water and cotton candy to drift across us . The animals shift nervously , and before I know it , I am surrounded by them , my chest filled with the sound of their hooves pounding the ground . I force myself to move closer , and just as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around one of the buffalo . For a minute I expect the whole herd to move in one merciless brown swarm , tramping me like grass . But they do n't . <p> The animal stands there as Jeff presses his face into its neck and smells . I touch his back . He ignores me and keeps on hugging . The animal 's eye rolls in my direction , and for a moment I do n't know what to do . I take my hand off Jeff . The bullhorn cackles more words I ca n't understand . Muskets crack and split the air in the distance . Jeff looks at me , his face covered with fur and dirt , and for the first time today I recognize someone in his eyes  --  a flicker of the person he might have been . He squeezes harder and harder , his face buried against the animal , and when he looks up his face is blank , the moment gone . <p> As the animals begin nudging and pushing me out of the circle , closing ranks , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him as Jeff 's arms tighten around the buffalo 's dusty neck . His body is soft and helpless against the thick brown of the buffalo . I wonder if I look the same or worse to the people in the crowd . A man afraid to move . A man frozen among the animals where touch is everything . The only thing . <p> <p> By Elwood Reid <p>
