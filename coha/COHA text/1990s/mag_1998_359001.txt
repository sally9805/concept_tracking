On all the maps , the beautiful , bustling island 100 miles off the coast of China is clearly labeled : Taiwan . The swarms of tourists and businessmen who arrive at the cavernous Chiang Kai-shek International Airport know they have landed in Taiwan . Even hostile communist officials in Beijing sometimes refer to their old foes , the Nationalists , as " the authorities on Taiwan . " But if the government on the island should ever begin calling itself the Republic of Taiwan , signaling that it is declaring its full independence from the mainland , the most likely reply from the People 's Republic of China across the straits would be a military attack and a war the U.S. would have trouble staying out of . <P> The uncomfortable truth is that Taiwan is already independent in all but name and that Beijing is sharpening its weapons to reverse the process . Last month Chinese President Jiang Zemin summoned his top officials for a three-day review of Taiwan policy and urged them to " speed up the reunification of the motherland . " Chinese Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core issue " in relations with the U.S. , and President Bill Clinton will hear all about that when he arrives in China next week . <P> Clinton will insist that he too supports the concept of one China and is not colluding in creating an independent Taiwan . But he will probably refuse to put that in writing , and he will not agree to stop selling modern weaponry to the Republic of China on Taiwan . The U.S. is caught right in the middle of one of the most explosive confrontations left in the world . <P> Washington 's promises that it will not tamper with Taiwan 's future by signing a new U.S.-China communique have not reassured Taipei . Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has already responded to Chinese demands with a policy statement nicknamed " the three nos " : that is , the U.S. will not support a two-China policy , nor Taiwan 's independence , nor Taiwan 's membership in the U.N . These are the points that China wants Clinton to write down and sign . <P> The mere possibility of such a Clinton-Jiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use better relations with the U.S. as bait , to entice Washington into a joint effort to put pressure on Taiwan . Taiwan is worried that some arm-twisting could be coming . " We believe the U.S. should not discuss the three nos with Beijing , " says Chen Chien-jen , director-general of the Government Information Office in Taipei . Adds Vice Foreign Minister David Lee : " We do n't want this written down because we do n't want Beijing to interpret what independence means . " <P> Washington has been hip deep in China 's civil war for 50 years , since General George C. Marshall tried unsuccessfully to mediate between the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek , and the communists led by Mao Zedong . Even now , under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 , the U.S. sells " arms of a defensive character " to Taiwan and warns Beijing that Washington expects " that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means . " Any use of force would be " of grave concern . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
