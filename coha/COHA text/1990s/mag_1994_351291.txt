Playwrights tend to burn out young , so the mere fact that Arthur Miller , 78 , opened a new drama on Broadway last week , 50 years after his debut , is noteworthy . Even better , the play is good  --  complex , a little mysterious , full of arresting incident , grippingly played . The bad news is that there is so little audience for serious work that its survival is , in the producer 's words , " week to week . " Only two new plays have had much of a run on Broadway this season , Neil Simon 's Laughter on the 23rd Floor and the second half of Tony Kushner 's Angels in America , and their attendance has been declining . <P> Broken Glass revisits familiar Miller terrain . The era is the Depression , the battleground is a Jewish family , the ugly rumbling offstage is the rise of Adolf Hitler . The mainspring of the play is the paralysis that Sylvia Gellburg suffers in her legs , which has no apparent physical cause . Is it a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the futile assimilationism of her Jew-among-Wasps banker husband ? Is it somehow tied to her Cassandra-like obsession with Hitler 's assault on German Jews , a threat in which no one around her sees urgency ? Or is her disability a plea for attention ? Meditating on these dilemmas are Sylvia ( Amy Irving ) , her volatile husband ( Ron Rifkin ) and a doctor ( David Dukes ) , who , without training , tries to psychoanalyze her , but begins to seduce her instead . <P> Miller 's theme , here and arguably in all his work , is that a sense of connection with other human beings , near and far , is at once our most destructive and most redemptive condition . Taking on other people 's problems exacerbates one 's own ; ignoring them leaves one spiritually dead . The doctor theorizes that people do not get sick alone , but in twos and threes and fours  --  and more . That has happened to Sylvia Gellburg and to the world collapsing around her .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
