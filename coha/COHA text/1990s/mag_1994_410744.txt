For more than a quarter-century , Americans have been voting with their feet against the economic policies and social conditions of the inner cities . Fifteen of the largest 25 U.S. cities have lost 4,000,000 people since 1965 , while the total U.S. population has risen by 60,000,000 . The exodus no longer is just " white flight "  --  minorities also are leaving the cities in record numbers . In recent years , the departure of businesses , jobs , and middle-income families from the old central cities has begun to resemble a stampede . For example , since the late 1970s , more than 50 Fortune 500 company headquarters have fled New York City , representing a loss of over 500,000 jobs . Cleveland , Detroit , Philadelphia , St. Louis , and other major cities also are suffering from severe out-migration of capital and people . Those once-mighty industrial centers are becoming hollow cores of poverty and crime . Ever since the Los Angeles riots and looting , urban lobbyists  --  including mayors , public employee unions , urban scholars , and many members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of Federal neglect under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush . " There was , quite literally , a massive Federal disinvestment in the cities in the 1980s , " according to Congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington , D.C. To revive them , the U.S. Conference of Mayors is asking for $35,000,000,000 in new Federal funds  --  a " Marshall Plan for the cities . " The Federal government already has tried the equivalent of some 25 Marshall Plans to revive the cities . Since 1965 , it has spent an estimated 2.5 trillion dollars on the War on Poverty and urban aid . ( That figure includes welfare , Medicaid , housing , education , job training , and infrastructure and direct aid to cities . ) Economist Walter Williams has calculated that this is enough money to purchase all the assets of the Fortune 500 companies plus all of the farmland in the U.S. , but it has not spurred urban revival . In 1992 alone , Federal aid to states and cities rose to $150,000,000,000 . Adjusted for inflation , that is the largest amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinvestment . CENTRAL CITIES ' BUDGETS ON THE RISE The budgets of Cleveland , Detroit , Philadelphia , New York , St. Louis , and other large central cities have not been shrinking ; they have been rapidly expanding for decades . In constant 1990 dollars , local governments spent , on average , $435 per resident in 1950 , $571 in 1965 , and $1,004 in 1990 . The largest cities saw an even faster budget rise . In real dollars , New York 's budget nearly tripled from $13,000,000,000 in 1965 to $37,000,000,000 in 1990 . Philadelphia , another nearly bankrupt city , allowed its budget to rise by 125% between 1965 and 1990  --  from $1,600,000,000 to $3,500,000,000 . During the same time period , the city lost 20% of its population . In short , 25 years of doubling and even tripling city budgets have not prevented urban bleeding . Not all U.S. cities are in decline . Among the nation 's largest urban areas , there are dozens  --  many on the West Coast , in the Sunbelt , and in the Southeast  --  that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years . Las Vegas , Nev. ; Phoenix , Ariz. ; Arlington and Austin , Tex. ; Sacramento and San Diego , Calif. ; Raleigh and Charlotte , N.C. ; and Jacksonville , Fla. , all have rapidly rising incomes , populations , and employment and low poverty and crime rates . What do growth cities  --  Phoenix , Raleigh , and San Diego , for example  --  do differently from shrinking cities such as Buffalo , Cleveland , and Detroit ? The answer is found , at least partially . in their fiscal policies . Bureau of the Census finance data from 1965 , 1980 , and 1990 for the 76 largest cities reveal significant and consistent patterns of higher spending and taxes in the low-growth cities than in the high-growth ones . * For every dollar of per capita expenditures ( excluding those spent on anti-poverty programs , education , and health care ) in the highest-growth cities , the shrinking cities spend $1.71. * In 1990 , a typical family of four living in one of the shrinking cities paid $1,100 per year more in taxes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . * Shrinking cities ' bureaucracies are twice Bs large as those of growth cities . In 1990 , the latter had , on average , 99 city employees per 10,000 residents ; the former , 235. * Cities with high spending and taxes lost population in the 1980s ; those with low spending and taxes gained . High spending and taxes are a cause , not just a consequence , of urban decline . Expenditures are high and rising in large central cities primarily because their governments generally have above-average unit costs for educating children , collecting garbage , building roads , policing neighborhoods , and providing other basic services . In 1988 , for example , the shrinking cities spent roughly $4,950 per pupil on education , whereas the high-growth cities spent $3,600 . The $1,350 cost differential can not be explained by better schools in places such as Detroit and Newark . The influence of municipal employee unions also contributes to higher costs in declining central cities . Compensation for unionized local employees tends to be roughly 30% above wages for comparably skilled private-sector workers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . In Philadelphia , the average municipal employee receives more than $50,000 a year in salary and benefits . According to the Census Bureau , cities with populations over 500,000 pay their mostly unionized workers more than 50% more than those with populations under 75,000 , whose workforces are less likely to be unionized . In short , thriving cities are places where costs are lower , bureaucracies are smaller , and services are better . Some city officials are beginning to recognize economic reality . Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell is challenging the entrenched municipal unions and other spending constituencies with a budget plan that calls for $1,100,000,000 in savings over five years . He has spurned more Federal aid as the poison that produced Philadelphia 's near-insolvency in 1992 . Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith have contracted out dozens of services to private providers and have slowed the growth of massive , bloated budgets to a crawl . The decline of America 's major cities is not inevitable . They can and should be saved . For generations , they have served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of culture , diversity , and intellect . Through an aggressive agenda of budget control , tax reduction , privatization , and deregulation , America 's declining cities can rise again in prominence and prosperity . The riots in Los Angeles in the spring of 1992 dramatized the social and economic deterioration of many central cities . At a rally held in Washington a month after the riots , then-New York Mayor David Dinkins aptly described the inner cities as places of " only grief and despair . " Almost all quality-of-life indicators for many of the fastest shrinking cities confirm that gloomy assessment . Consider these examples : * The 1990 census data reveal that 48% of all Detroit households are headed by a single female . * Newark has a lower real per capita income today than it did in 1969. * Cleveland had nearly 1,000,000 residents in the 1950s ; now , it has fewer than 500,000. * The Chicago area has averaged 10,000 manufacturing job losses annually for the past 15 years . A Feb. 14 , 1992 , Chicago Tribune headline said it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis has lost more than two of every five jobs it had in 1965. * Philadelphia has a four-year $1,000,000,000 budget deficit . Its bond rating sunk so low that it effectively is blocked from municipal capital markets and must borrow through a state oversight agency . * Washington , D.C. , has been dubbed the " murder capital of the world . " * In Baltimore , 56% of black males between the ages of 18 and 35 were in trouble with the law in 1991 , according to a study by the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives . The root cause of almost all the social , economic , and fiscal problems of America 's depressed cities is the steady flight of businesses and middle-and upper-income families . In the past quarter-century , 15 major cities combined have lost 3,800,000 people and roughly the same number of jobs . No longer is the issue just white flight . The 1990 census data suggest that middle-income minorities are fleeing to the suburbs in record numbers . The urban crisis is not shared by all cities . The declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest-growth cities . Raleigh , for instance , has seen its population almost double , jobs more than double , and real per capita income grow by better than 40% since the mid 1960s . The wide diversity in the economic performance of central cities suggests that the individual policies of each play an important role in explaining urban growth and decline . In conventional analyses of the urban crisis , cities are portrayed primarily as victims of national trends , Federal mandates , and other conditions beyond their control . Factors blamed include the recession , Reagan budget cuts , suburbanization , decline in manufacturing , rise of the automobile , immigration , an aging infrastructure , racism , AIDS , homelessness , urban gangs , guns , and drugs . Each of these can place considerable strain on municipal budgets , yet city officials are impotent to combat them . There is some truth to this . The last recession is painful evidence that no city is immune from the impact of national economic conditions and policies . For instance , from the 1950s through the 1980s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state widely was considered recession proof . Yet , the recession had a devastating impact on California localities  --  many of which are at the top of the list of growth cities . One-third of all job losses in the past two years has occurred in California . Another example is the impact that wide fluctuations in international oil prices in the 1970s and 1980s had on the economies and budgets of Texas cities . Unquestionably , there are regional factors at play in determining relative rates of growth . Most of the declining cities are the once-mighty industrial centers in the Northeast and Midwest  --  the Rust Belt . Most of the growth cities are in the Sun Belt , on the West Coast , and in the Southeast . A related factor that usually correlates with the rate of economic growth is age  --  older cities tend to experience less economic growth , a phenomenon that often is attributed to their aging infrastructures . Still , the fact that some cities have been flourishing for long periods of time as others have been deteriorating suggests that self-imposed policies play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors can not explain fully the different growth rates of cities . Although the South has been a high-growth region , three of the fastest declining cities  --  Birmingham , Louisville , and New Orleans  --  are in that area . Even within states , there are significant differences in the economic performance of cities . Why is Oakland declining , but Santa Ana growing ? Why is Arlington doing so much better than Fort Worth , or Colorado Springs better than Denver ? What explains the fact that the eighth fastest growing city , Lexington , and the ninth fastest declining city , Louisville , both are in Kentucky ? An important factor is that their spending and taxing policies are very different . Growth cities have pro-growth fiscal policies ; declining cities , anti-growth . Taxes and spending . There are several potential problems in comparing spending and taxes by city . The major one is the division of responsibilities for program funding among state governments , counties , school districts , and cities differs from state to state . For example , in some , the responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , it is paid for by the state government ; and in still others , the cities bear the cost . Another complication is that some cities are not part of independent counties , and so the city government funds all the activities of the county . By contrast , most cities are part of larger counties , which means that the costs of funding services such as hospitals and courts in the inner cities are spread to the suburbs . Finally , in some cities , school funding is handled by school districts or in large part by the state , not the city , government . Another potential difficulty with comparing city growth rates over time is that borders change . Many cities , such as Portland , Ore. , aggressively have annexed neighboring suburbs . In the case of Portland , annexation has been a major source of population growth . However , that annexation probably is as much a consequence of the city 's economic success as it is an explanation . In many cases , localities have merged with central cities because it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same token , more and more localities are attempting to secede from declining central cities because the latter 's economic policies , such as tax rates and service costs , have grown too burdensome . Population growth . The best indication of the liability of a city probably is whether people are moving to or out of it . Those that had large population losses from 1965 to 1990 spend , tax , and hire city workers at roughly twice the rates of the cities that had large population gains . For instance , the highest-growth cities ( those with population gains of 100% or more ) spend six percent of personal income , whereas the lowest-growth cities ( those that lost at least 15% of their populations ) expend 12% of personal income . The highest-growth cities had 107 employees per 10,000 residents vs. 217 in the lowest-growth cities . Those findings suggest that cities with high taxes and service costs are driving people away . Job growth . Just as population changes are a measure of how people are voting with their feet , so are employment patterns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas with pro-growth and pro-business climates . Per capita spending is roughly 50% higher in the lowest-growth cities than in those with the greatest increase in employment . The cities with the lowest growth in employment spend almost $1.40 for every $1.00 of municipal expenditures in the highest-growth cities . High taxes and spending are driving businesses and jobs away from shrinking cities . Female-headed households . One indication of poverty and family disintegration in an area is the percentage of female-headed households . Fatherless homes are about eight times more likely to be poor than are intact families . Moreover , children who grow up in fatherless households are much more likely to commit crimes and engage in other socially unacceptable behavior of the type that plagues inner cities . Between 1970 and 1990 , the percentage of female-headed households rose at an alarming pace nationwide . The largest growth occurred in the inner cities , where Census Bureau data indicate an increase from about 15 to 35% in fatherless homes . Cities with the largest rise in female-headed households have spending and taxes at least 50% higher than those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best measures of the economic growth rate of a city and the standard of living of its residents . The cities with the lowest growth in income ( less than 10% ) are characterized by per capita spending and taxes that are about 10% higher than those of cities with the highest growth in income ( more than 25% ) . As a share of personal income , spending and taxes are about 25% higher in cities with the lowest growth . WHERE THE MONEY GOES The urban lobby and scholars invariably argue that low-growth cities spend more because their needs are greater . Poor cities have to meet increased demands for antipoverty spending , subsidized child care , homeless assistance , drug abatement and rehabilitation , crime control , job training , etc . Because declining cities have less wealth and fewer workers and businesses to pay the cost of those programs , they have to impose higher tax burdens on their residents and businesses to raise the same amount of revenue wealthy and prospering cities do . Education is a major budget item that should not cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . If per student education costs were uniform across cities , one would expect to find higher per pupil expenditures in growing and affluent areas if only because the residents have more money to devote to the schools . Indeed , the education lobby successfully has argued before several state supreme courts that school financing is inequitable because wealthy areas spend more on schools than do poor areas . The data show that , on average , per pupil expenditures on schools in the lowest job growth cities are approximately $1,800 higher than they are in the highest job growth cities . Yet , spending on schools and student performance appear to be wholly unrelated . For example , Washington , D.C. , which spent almost $6,000 per student in 1988 , has among the worst inner-city schools in the nation . Conversely , San Diego spent about $3,500 per child in 1988 for schools that are considered above average for cities its size . Low-growth cities appear to provide education , one of the major items in local budgets , much less cost-efficiently than do high-growth cities . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national average for large cities , they could reduce their per family tax burden by hundreds of dollars . City taxes and economic growth . A city 's economic performance is influenced not only by its over-all tax burden , but by the composition of its taxes . In particular , income taxes have a consistently strong negative effect on city growth rates . Only one high-growth city  --  Lexington , Ky.  --  imposes a city income tax , whereas the low-growth cities have average per capita income taxes of approximately $100-200 . The evidence suggests that imposition of a city income tax is a recipe for economic decline . City property taxes also have a negative impact on economic growth , but not to the extent that income taxes do . Cities with high population and job growth , as well as those with low poverty rates , have substantially lower property taxes than cities in decline . City sales taxes have no apparent positive or negative impact on economic growth . If anything , high-growth cities tend to rely heavily on sales taxes for revenue ; declining cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers and businesses are affected not only by local tax burdens , but by state taxes as well . High-growth cities tend to be located in states that have low combined city-state tax burdens . State and city taxes are about $360 per person higher in cities with population losses of 15% or more since 1965 than in those with population gains of 100% or more . Even more dramatic is the destructive impact of high combined state and city income taxes on the economic performance of cities . Growth cities tend to have state and local income tax burdens that are , on average , about 60% of those of shrinking cities . Federal aid . Cities have a multitude of problems , but too little money is not one of them . Real per capita spending escalated from $435 in 1950 to $571 in 1965 to $1,004 in 1990 . At the start of that spending binge , America 's largest cities were at the peak of prosperity  --  indeed , they had higher per capita incomes than the suburbs . Now , incomes are 50% lower than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prevented urban bleeding ; if anything , it has accelerated it . Those figures understate the true extent of the budget buildup in cities . In the 1950s and early 1960s. cities had primary responsibility for funding welfare programs and indigent health care , whereas today the burden of funding anti-poverty programs is borne mostly by the Federal government and the states . In fact . most cities spend a much smaller share of their budgets on health and welfare than they did 40 years ago . The cities that are least underfunded are not the smaller , more affluent communities , but the largest ones ( i.e. , those that would be the beneficiaries of more Federal aid ) . Cities with populations over 500,000 spend roughly $1,200 per resident ( excluding health , education , and welfare ) , whereas communities with populations under 75,000 spend about $550 . The primary reason the expenditures of large central cities are so excessive is not that they have more responsibilities ; it is that they are increasingly inefficient in providing basic services . It costs New York , Chicago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much to educate a child , collect garbage , build a road , police a neighborhood , and provide other basic services as it does smaller communities . From 1980 to 1990 , direct Federal aid to cities was reduced by about 50% . That reduction was made up in various ways . A 1990 study in the American Economic Review reports that , for every dollar the cities lost in Federal aid , they received an additional 80 cents in state aid . Moreover , while direct Federal aid to cities was cut in the Reagan years , aid to poor people living in cities increased . Federal social welfare spending-on education , training , social services , employment , low-income assistance , community development , and transportation  --  rose from $255,000,000,000 to $285,000,000,000 from 1980 to 1992 . Those figures exclude Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid  --  programs that have mushroomed in cost and significantly benefit inner-city residents as well . Since 1989 , domestic spending across the board , including outlays on urban aid , has exploded . Federal domestic spending under George Bush rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domestic budget under any president in 30 years . In real terms , cities and states received more Federal money in 1992 than in any previous year . Since the late 1960s , the Federal government has spent 2.5 trillion dollars on urban renewal and the War on Poverty , or the equivalent of 25 Marshall Plans . The reason the money has not caused an urban revival is that the programs , particularly those that were abolished in the 1980s , did not work . For example , Urban Development Action Grants , which finally were abolished in 1987 , subsidized the construction of major chain hotels , such as Hyatts , and luxury housing developments with rooftop tennis courts , health spas , and indoor tennis courts in Detroit . Despite Federal grants totaling more than $50,000,000,000 for urban transit since the mid 1960s , total ridership has declined . The Federal government spent over $2,000,000,000 to build Miami 's Metrorail , which the local population calls Metrorail ; today , it has less than 20% of predicted ridership and its operating subsidies are in the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audit of Federal wastewater treatment grants to cities found that construction costs were 30% higher when plants were built with Federal funding than when local taxpayers footed the bill . Even cities that have received huge infusions of direct Federal aid have not been able to leverage those funds to resuscitate their economies . For instance , Gary , Ind. , got more than $150,000,000 from 1968 to 1972 for urban renewal  --  or about $1,000 per resident  --  yet the city 's deterioration continued . Cuts in urban aid can not account for the Los Angeles riots , the exodus from New York City , sky-high poverty in Detroit , and other woes of the central cities . The period of catastrophic decline of population , incomes , and jobs was the 1970s , when urban aid exploded . By every meaningful measure of social and economic progress , the 1970s were the worst decade for cities since at least the 1930s . By contrast , the Reagan years were a period of economic gains for many big cities . " The 1980s was the best decade in this century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post reporter Joel Garreau in his 1992 book on urban America , Edge City . " From Boston to Philadelphia to Washington to Los Angeles to San Francisco to Seattle to Houston to Dallas to Atlanta , the business districts of the downtowns thrived . " Adjusted for inflation , the tax base of America 's inner cities expanded by 50% in the 1980s , compared to 20% in the 1970s . The entrepreneurial explosion unleashed by Reaganomics had a very positive effect on the finances of big cities . Medium-sized areas fared even better . More than 150 thriving new suburban cities have grown up during the past decade , such as Fairfax , Va. ; Mesa , Ariz. ; and Irvine , Calif . They quickly have become centers of enterprise and job creation . Until the recent recession , the problem confronting those booming cities was too much development and business investment , not too little . AN AGENDA FOR URBAN RENAISSANCE Reviving America 's depressed cities will require implementation of a growth-oriented agenda on the part of the Federal government , states , and cities . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives for people , businesses , and capital to return to the inner cities . Federal role . A proper adherence to the constitutional principles of federalism would dictate that the Federal government have almost no direct relationship with cities . All Federal programs that give direct aid to local governments and Federal regulations that mandate local spending should be abolished . Federal aid , to the extent that it continues , should be provided to the states . If cities and other jurisdictions of the states are in need of financial aid , it should be provided by the state legislatures . If Congress feels compelled to assist areas that have deep pockets of poverty , money should be given directly to poor people , not city bureaucracies or service providers . There seems to be a bipartisan consensus emerging on such a strategy . A 1982 Brookings Institution report on urban decline emphasized that policymakers " should consider switching more federal aid from empowering governments to deliver services , to empowering individuals and households to purchase services or provide their own . " There are practical as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal aid to foreign countries , little of the money ever gets filtered through the city bureaucracies . For example , according to the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute , Milwaukee spends about $1,100,000,000 in Federal , state , and local money annually on poverty abatement . That money flows through 68 programs that spend almost $30,000 per poor family , but only about 35 cents of every dollar ever gets to the poor . Most of the Federal money funds a massive welfare industry . Probably the only effective Federal agenda for aiding the cities is the promotion of national economic growth . The lesson of the past three decades is that central cities ' fiscal fortunes often turn with the national economy . In the slow-growth , high-inflation 1970s , cities rapidly deteriorated ; in the prosperous 1980s , they partially revived ; but in the recessionary 1990s , cities again are financially strapped . Reducing Federal deficit spending through expenditure control , growth-oriented reductions in payroll and capital gains taxes , a noninflationary monetary policy , and regulatory relief will have a very positive effect on cities . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulatory relief to all areas nationwide , but , if politics precludes doing so , the enterprise zone concept is viable , as long as it means tax reduction and deregulation , not a new subsidy program . States ' role . State governments substantially increased their aid to cities in the 1980s , but during the 1990s , with budget problems in statehouses , aid to localities has declined . In general , such reduction is appropriate . States should not be in the business of paying for locally provided services or acting as the cities ' tax collectors . Whenever possible , local services should be paid for with local taxes . State aid to localities is defensible only when it distributes funds exclusively to lower-income jurisdictions or pays for services that provide a direct benefit for the entire state . The principal way state governments can promote the economic growth of their cities is to reduce the over-all state tax burden on individuals and businesses . States without an income tax  --  such as Florida and Texas  --  tend to have healthy and growing cities . Northeastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that region . For example , New York City has estimated that a $900,000,000 tax increase proposed by the state would cost the city some 300,000 jobs . CUTTING SERVICE COSTS Cities ' role . The key to restoring economic vitality and capital investment to declining cities is to reduce the costs of providing municipal services and then slash the heavy tax burdens that are required to pay for them . For no justifiable reason , unit service costs are substantially higher in large cities than in small ones  --  whether for education , public transportation , street cleaning , park maintenance , garbage collection , or police protection . Labor costs appear to explain much of the inefficiency . Salaries of government workers in suburbs average $2,150 a month , compared to $2,700 a month in cities with populations over 500,000 . If benefits are added , the disparities are even wider . Large cities also pay their employees substantially more than comparably skilled private-sector workers receive , and the gap is growing larger . If cities had the political will to cut service costs and taxes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin is through competitive contracts . Smaller cities routinely contract out municipal services ; large unionized cities seldom do . Indeed , some , such as La Mirada , Calif. , contract out almost all their services and thus have tiny city bureaucracies . Several dozen studies verify that unit costs are reduced 20-50% by contracting out to the private sector . Moreover , the quality of contracted-out services is rated higher than that of services offered in-house . However , public employee unions are so powerful in some large cities that not only is contracting out effectively prohibited , but any private-sector competition with the government monopoly service provider is forbidden by regulation . For instance , in New York City , private van and jitney services are providing fast , reliable transit for Manhattan commuters , yet the city transit agency has acted to shut such operators down . The action is contrary to the interests of residents and area workers . City provisions that prohibit private competition with the government should be ended . Education is one of the largest items in city budgets . The declining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally lower-quality public schools . In most large cities today , private schools provide a better education for half the cost of inner-city public schools . Central cities can cut costs significantly by recognizing that , when parents send their children to private schools , there are huge savings for the public school system . Even accounting for the fact that some school costs are fixed , if cities were to provide inner-city parents with incomes under $30,000 a voucher of , say , $2,500 per year to send each child to a private school , the public school systems significantly could reduce their operating costs and educational opportunities for children of low-income families would be improved . There are diseconomies of scale in municipal services . Some cities , like New York , have such powerful special-interest lobbies and entrenched bureaucracies that it has become politically impossible to cut service costs , even in times of severe crisis . Large cities could reduce costs by splitting service responsibilities and conferring taxing authority on city districts , villages , or even homeowner associations . If the provision of services and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taxpayers would have greater influence on decisions about which services they need and which they do not , and they could place greater pressure on the government to reduce costs by diluting the influence of special-interest groups . An even more radical idea is for cities to acknowledge that they have become unmanageable at their current size and to split up into separate smaller jurisdictions . It would make sense , for instance , for each borough of New York City to become a separate city , as Staten Island is attempting to do . Service responsibilities that can not be divided conveniently  --  poverty programs perhaps  --  then could be borne by the county government . Finally , cities can lure businesses and people back by changing the composition of taxes . If all cities with income taxes were to replace them and other levies on industry with sales taxes , those cities substantially could improve the business climate within their borders . City income taxes are defended by local officials as fair because they fall primarily on upper-income individuals and big business . In practice , those taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and small business owners , because the wealthy have fled most cities with income taxes or have received legislative exemptions from high taxes . Urban advocates are right when they say that America 's inner cities have been victims of destructive government policies , but not those of the Federal government . The wounds of the central cities largely are self-inflicted . A 1988 private audit of nearly bankrupt Scranton , Pa. , stated that " the city government appears to exist for the benefit of its employees instead of the people . " Those words could describe the operating principles and skewed priorities of too many ailing cities . Unless and until America 's central cities start putting people first , cutting service costs and anti-growth tax rates , no amount of Federal aid can reverse the decline of urban America . Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel are , respectively , director of fiscal policy studies and a research assistant , Cato Institute , Washington , D.C. <p>
