How can Serbs support Slobodan Milosevic after what he has done in Kosovo ? " Westerners often ask . The truth is many Serbs just do n't know the facts . Their ignorance is symptomatic of life in Serbia , where appearance and reality are carefully managed by Milosevic 's propaganda machine . And though some Serbs have access to CNN and the Internet , it 's still tough for them to get a clear view in a state where Milosevic controls even the weather report . <P> At all costs Milosevic wants to maintain his fiction that Serbia won the war and Kosovo is not lost . To achieve this illusion , Milosevic has had to engineer one of the strangest U-turns in the history of propaganda . First , NATO was the enemy , the evil aggressor who bombed Serbia . Now peacekeepers from NATO countries are said to be protecting the Serbs  --  and , ultimately , their stake in the province . Last week TIME 's Belgrade team assembled a week 's worth of Milosevic 's propaganda . Then we turned to some spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's clear that getting rid of Milosevic will involve finding a way to weaken his propaganda operations . <P>  --  By Gillian Sandford and Duska Anastasijevic/Belgrade
