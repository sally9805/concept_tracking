<p> So how tough is saying goodbye to Knots Landing ? " Do you want me to cry in front of you ? " Michele Lee asks in mock despair . <p> Well , not in the kitchen . <p> There 's something about kitchens and Knots Landing . In 14 years of upscale-suburban pulp and passion , what has n't been gossiped about , dished and digested in Michele 's - er , Karen 's - kitchen ? <p> Over coffee . Or as breakfast is whipped up in lovingly choreographed displays of exposition and domestic highs and lows . Or as meatloaf , maybe a casserole , is prepared after a long day in the trenches of prime-time soap opera . <p> As Knots bows out tonight in a three-hour extravaganza ( CBS , 8 p.m . ET/PT ) , what better place to eulogize than in Michele Lee 's own kitchen ? It may be more expansive and well-appointed than Karen Fairgate MacKenzie 's - with speakers for piped-in music , tivoli lights in the cabinets and a benchlike nook so guests can watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no less inviting . <p> " The kitchen is the heart of the home , " Lee says . <p> She means her own tucked-away abode in Beverly Hills , on this spring morning equipped with bagels , cream cheeses and fruit salad . " We designed it this way because we found that , when entertaining , everybody congregates in the kitchen . " <p> But her spiel on the kitchen is just a prelude to her discourse on the icon of Knots ' cul-de-sac , Seaview Circle . The MacKenzie kitchen , next door to the Ewings ' , was a longtime haven , a Thursday night tradition for millions . <p> " The image of that cul-de-sac , and those homes sitting at the end of it , was emotional . Pouring coffee in a kitchen or making the pasta and listening to your best friend , that 's something we all identify with . " <p> Knots was like that . " For many people who watched the show , Thursday night became a center , a focus for either family members or girlfriends or phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lee knows this . She watched Knots every week on her own TV . " It was n't ego . I was a Knots Landing fan . " Still is . It 's hard to let go . <p> As she talks about the final days , tears well up . " I ca n't help it , " she says , laughing . " There 's a part of me that is married to that character ( deep breath ) and that kitchen . That 's it . It 's honest . I 'm very familial . I 've seen people from the show more since we quit than before . Everybody 's in withdrawal . " <p> To understate the situation , she adds , " Goodbyes are hard . " A pained smile . " Do n't start , " she chides . <p> Calling Michele Lee Knots Landing 's den mother is " a sweet way to put the truth - she was the tent pole , " says David Jacobs , who created Knots as a spinoff of Dallas and considered Karen " my alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , Jacobs says , " I 'm just as ill-equipped to define it all objectively as she is . " <p> He made the conscious decision to schedule the last day of filming in the MacKenzie kitchen . On call : Lee , her TV husband Kevin Dobson ( Mack ) , returning and presumed-dead heroine Joan Van Ark ( Val ) and the only other original cast member Ted Shackelford ( Gary ) . <p> " Give me a break , " Lee says . " That last day , we had the best time . We laughed , cracked up , got naughty , we cost so much time . It was our way of getting through the day . " <p> Jacobs was there . " I got to say , ' It 's a wrap . ' It barely came out . " <p> After tonight , Knots is a wrap for viewers , as well . An age has passed : the Ewing era , which began in 1978 with Dallas and dominated prime time through much of the ' 80s . <p> Of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . Beyond the kidnappings , outlandish cliffhangers , big-business intrigues and bedroom shenanigans , Knots felt most like family . A kind of gaudy , eccentric cousin , perhaps . <p> " I did n't think it would ever be the megahit Dallas was , but I always said it could run longer , " Jacobs says . It might have run indefinitely , if TV economics had n't prevailed . With flat ratings the last few seasons , and escalating production costs and salaries , Knots was just too pricey . <p> " The danger of keeping Knots going would have been trying to do it with further erosion , " Jacobs says . " Bill Devane ( Sumner ) and Nicollette Sheridan ( Paige ) were both going to leave after this season . And it was so hard to do it this year . " To keep costs down , each actor was written out of four episodes - even when it made no story sense . <p> Everyone , that is , but Lee . <p> With Karen 's marriage to Mack breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final regular hour episodes . " And I could n't take it , " Lee says . " I could n't take it . So I offered them my services . I mean , how could I not be in the last four shows after being in every episode , right ? " <p> Hastily inserted were scenes of heartsore Karen in New York . Her record is intact ; she 's the only one to be in all 344 episodes . <p> " My feelings were two-pronged . It was very emotional , so a lot of it had to do with my feelings for the show . And the other was selfish : How could I not be in every episode ! " <p> There you have it . " I loved Karen . I really did . Even though she was largely my personality , there was a thing about her . And her life . And her place in the community and how she felt about her family and her sense of humor and the way she did things a little bit bigger than me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who 'd blame her ? <p> But under the sadness , there 's no bitterness . " That 's the killer . You ca n't blame anybody . We 're dealing with a new world , new economics . " <p> She takes comfort that this last season was " a valiant try . The show in many ways was better than it had been in the recent past . " And she has a future at CBS , having just signed a deal to star in and produce a series and movies , including a bio of country star Dottie West . <p> Tonight 's two-hour finale , preceded by an hour " block party " of memories and clips , " will be emotionally satisfying for the fan , " Lee promises . " All the stories and main characters ( including the return of Van Ark and Donna Mills ) are played out , so there 's completion . If the show had to end . . .

With a few little twists and a pleasant little joke at the end . " <p> Jacobs says he has " let go already " of Knots , but when he saw a rough cut of the " block party " special , " I got very emotional . I do think it 's time to say adios . I 'm just glad we went out with some dignity . " <p> And more than a few tears .
