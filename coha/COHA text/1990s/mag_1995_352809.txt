NATION <P> A Brawl in the House <P> It started out mildly enough , as Democratic Representative Carrie Meek of Florida delivered a routine denunciation of Speaker Newt Gingrich 's lucrative book deal with a Rupert Murdoch- owned publishing house . But before Meek could reach the end of her short speech , the Republican-managed House ruled her out of order and voted to strike her remarks from the record . The parliamentary scrap immediately brought a phalanx of the people 's Representatives to the floor to scream at one another , with Republicans denouncing the speech for lack of decorum and Democrats blasting the g.o.p. ' s " totalitarianism . " Later , in a bare-knuckles address at a Republican gathering , Gingrich personally took up the fight , calling the attacks on his book deal " disgusting " and taking broad swipes at Democrats , the press and-perhaps reflexively-Hillary Rodham Clinton . <P> In the Senate , " Byrdlock " <P> Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia , the Democrats ' parliamentary ace and self-appointed guardian of the Senate 's deliberative role , launched an all-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamroller . " Byrd 's filibuster-like maneuvers reduced to a snail 's pace the Senate 's debate of a bill that would restrict the ability of Congress to impose unfunded regulatory mandates on the states . His exploitation of an arcane rule regarding committee meeting times also forced the Judiciary Committee to halt-if for only one day-its consideration of a balanced-budget amendment . Majority leader Bob Dole was sufficiently ruffled to grumble about the Senate 's " Byrdlock . " <P> The Simpson Case <P> Just days before the opening of the O.J. Simpson murder trial , the former football star 's high-powered legal defense suffered one of its most damaging defeats . Judge Lance Ito ruled that the prosecution could present in evidence the bulk of the materials it has gathered that might show Simpson was a violently jealous and abusive husband . The judge handed the defense one small win , though , allowing it to introduce some evidence regarding the alleged racist attitudes of a key detective . The mostly negative developments for the defense capped a week in which an embarrassing ego spat between two of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became public . <P> Keep On Flying <P> Voting 6 to 2 in a case involving American Airlines , the U.S. Supreme Court decided that passengers may sue an airline for retroactively downgrading their frequent-flyer benefits . The Justices concluded that federal airline-regulation laws do not pre-empt such breach-of-contract suits in state courts . <P> The Farrakhan-Plot Case <P> Malcolm X 's daughter Qubilah Shabazz pleaded not guilty to charges that she plotted to have Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan killed . Meanwhile , Farrakhan publicly echoed the claim of Shabazz 's lawyers that the case was a setup by the government . <P> Union County Drownings <P> A sobbing Susan Smith , accused of drowning her two small boys in a car last October , appeared in court for her arraignment and learned that the prosecution would seek the death penalty . A South Carolina judge entered a not-guilty plea for her after the Union County mother declined to enter a plea of her own . <P> WORLD <P> A Brutal Shock for Japan               @ @ @ @ @ @
