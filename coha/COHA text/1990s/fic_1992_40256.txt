A major supporter of Black art and culture , Johnson Publishing Co. has supported Black writers by publishing young writers in Black World magazine and in the books of the Johnson Publishing Co . Book Division . The company continues that effort in the Gertrude Johnson Williams Literary Contest , which awards $10,000 in prizes every year for the best original short stories . The contest , named for the publisher 's late mother , is designed to stimulate interest in writing and to raise the level of consciousness and hope of African-American writers and readers . " We at EBONY , " Publisher John H. Johnson said , " have noted the relative scarcity of Black writers . We want to encourage the abundance of talent we believe exists . " The 1992 winner , reprinted here , attracted wide attention . The author was Mary B. Smith , a schoolteacher who lives in Elkins Park , Pa. , with her husband , Snowden . They have three children . <p> Mrs. Brown , the terror of the eighth grade , had just finished testing her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lanky , molasses-colored boy appeared . On his head sat a blue cap with the visor tilted rakishly over one ear . His tan shirt , at least three sizes too big , was tucked carelessly into black pants whose legs sagged like deflated balloons and crumpled over a pair of scruffy white sneakers . In one hand was an envelope . <p> Davida Davis gasped . " Oooh . Country done come to school . " <p> Mrs. Brown frowned at her disapprovingly , then signaled the boy with an arthritic forefinger . " Come in , sir . " <p> The boy shuffled to a desk in front of the tiny room , where he slumped , arms folded , legs crossed at the ankles , and balefully eyed the girl sitting at the teacher 's elbow . <p> " Seven point O. Very good , " Mrs. Brown entered the score on Davida 's record . " Last time it was six . Keep it up and you 'll be on grade level by the end of the year . " <p> Puffed with pride , Davida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the class . " She picked up her bookbag , hesitated , then leaned toward the teacher and whispered behind her cupped hand : " Miss Brown , that boy live ' round my way . He baaad . He be cuttin ' school , playin ' cards and figh  --  . " <p> The boy 's voice rumbled deep in his chest . " You better not be talkin ' ' bout me , girl . " <p> Now , Mrs. Brown belonged to that genus of teacher who had no fear of young rowdies . As his tough-sounding words fell on her ears , her round , dusky face hardened ; her short , grizzled hair seemed to stand up like the ruffled feathers of an agitated setting hen . <p> She dismissed Davida with a flourish , then , eyes narrowed , she rose slowly , folded her arms and leaned toward the boy sitting across from her desk . <p> " Young man , " she said in her deep voice , " my name is Mrs. Brown . In this room students do not threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at the teacher ; his eyes met a piercing glare that had deflated a thousand belligerent egos . His eyes wavered , then fell . <p> After a measured silence , the teacher spoke . " Now , I believe that envelope you 're carrying is for me . " Eyes still on the boy , she sat down . " You may bring it to my desk  --  after you remove your headgear . " <p> The boy snatched off his cap . " ' Scuse me . I forgot . " <p> Mrs. Brown waved him to the chair next to her desk , opened the envelope and drew out a scribbled note : ' Gerald King . 15 . Disc/transf . No recs . TRUANT . Test/placement G.8 . ' <p> Annoyed , she tapped the note . She had been too busy to eat and had delayed her lunch until this last period of the day . She thought of the turkey-raisin sandwich in her locker and her stomach muttered . She looked over at the sullen boy who was now staring dejectedly at the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the next day , he might not return for weeks . And the sandwich would keep . She pushed the note under a corner of her blotter , then wrote his name on a blank 3X5 card . <p> " Well , Gerald , you seem to need a reading test . " <p> " What for ? " The boy 's leg began to jiggle . <p> Nervous , Mrs. Brown wrote on the card . " We like to know something about you before we assign you to a group . " <p> " In the other school they put me in class right away . " <p> Without answering , Mrs. Brown handed him a book from a pile on her desk . " Read up to page five . " <p> Opening the book as if he expected it to explode , the boy peeked in , then pushed it away . " This is a baby book . " <p> Obstinate , wrote Mrs. Brown . " Why do you think that ? " <p> " It 's skinny . And ai n't nothin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty oak from an acorn grew . " She held out a card with 10 words listed in large print . " Read these . " The boy ran a shaky hand over his head . " Oh , man . " <p> " Ca n't read them either , huh ? " Pre-primer , she wrote . <p> He swelled up , " I can re  --  , " then subsided beneath the teacher 's steady gaze and muttered . " I just do n't have my glasses , that 's all . My mom got to get me some new ones . " <p> " Tell it to the Marines . " Mrs. Brown shook the strip under his nose . " Read any word you can . " <p> The boy drew his head back and studied the words . He pointed . " Is . " He pointed again . " The . And this one 's A. " <p> " Yippee . " Mrs. Brown wrote the three words on the card . " When 's the last time you 've been to school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' about me . " <p> Mrs. Brown tapped the slip of paper on her blotter . " This note says you 're a truant . " She wrote a problem in long division on a sheet of paper and handed it to him . " Do this . " She watched the boy closely as he worked the problem . <p> " That was easy . " <p> Reasoning O.K. , Mrs. Brown wrote on the card . Now it was time to prick him , see if there was anything in him but hot air . She looked over at him slyly . " You say arithmetic is easy , but you ca n't read . Now what does that mean , that you 're too dumb to do both ? " <p> " No ! " The boy 's eyes flared , then cooled . " My grampa said I was smart . He the one showed me how to figure . How to drive , too . " <p> Sensitive , she noted . " Where 's your grandfather now ? " <p> The boy shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little prodding , he told her about a six-year-old boy whose teenaged mother left him on a tobacco farm in South Carolina where they were living with her parents . There was pride in his voice as he talked about helping his grandfather with the hoeing , planting and harvesting , sometimes even driving the truck to town with the crops whenever the old man got sick . " That 's why he taught me how to figure . So nobody could cheat me , " he said shyly . After his grandmother died , he missed a lot of school and fell behind . It seemed important for him to be with his grandfather , so he stopped going . Then two years ago , his grandfather died and he ran the farm by himself for a year . It was a tenant farm , and when the owner found out about his grandfather 's death , he contacted the boy 's mother . " So I had to come live with her . " He sighed . " But I sure was doin ' better down there than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown . " You ca n't do better if you get kicked out of school for misbehaving . " <p> Gerald hung his head . " Them kids laughed at the way I talk and called me ' country ' . So I fighted them . But they kept on , and I kept on , so the principal sended me here . " <p> " Every school has enough home-grown hoodlums . " <p> " I ai n't no hoodlum , ma'am . " The boy spoke with quiet dignity . " Else I would n't be here today . " <p> " Maybe . Or maybe you 'd be in a family court . " <p> " No ma'am . I come on my own . So my mother and stepfather stop arguin ' over me . " <p> Mrs. Brown regarded the boy 's scowling face , his slumped shoulder , his work-hardened hands trembling on his thighs . Her heart tightened . Her stern face softened . Now here was a boy with a logical mind , mother wit , determination . But he was caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to be freed . Was she to late ? She would find out . Face set , voice hard , she said , " Sit up , sir . Look at me . " <p> Facing her sheepishly , the boy hitched his body up . <p> Mrs. Brown looked deep into his eyes and said , " You are 15 years old and you are illiterate . " She paused to let that awful word sink in . " You ca n't read . Can you ? " <p> The boy 's eyes filled . " No ma'am . " His voice was husky . <p> Mrs. Brown almost relented , but she had trod this path for many years . Her voice was soft . " Others can . " Now urgent . " Why ca n't you ? " <p> The boy frowned , then pressed his lips together and stared at the floor as if he would find the answer there . At last he shrugged . " It just seem like ai n't no system to it . " <p> That answer did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar ones . " Well there is . In fact , we have an easy one here , " she paused significantly . " But a lot of kids do n't want to learn it . That is , at first . " <p> The boy eyed her suspiciously . " How come ? " <p> " They say the other kids laugh at the books they use . " <p> " Then they stupid , " snorted Gerald . " They be laughin ' at ' em anyway ' cause they ca n't read the real books in class . " <p> " But not for long . " Mrs Brown leaned forward . " A few years ago a boy named Alfred came here in the seventh grade . He read worse than you . His mother moved around a lot , so he 'd been in sixteen different schools before he got to this one . He was never in one school long enough to learn how to read . " Mrs. Brown tapped the book that Gerald had rejected so disdainfully a few minutes earlier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in one period . " <p> Gerald 's eyes widened . " This book ? " <p> " Alfred piled right on through it and seven others in three months . He pulled up from reading no grade to fourth grade in half a year . And when he left here in the ninth grade , he was reading like a champ . " She sat back , reminiscing . " Of course , Alfred was smart . " <p> " I could do the same thing . " <p> " Alfred was logical , too . He could figure things out  --  " Mrs. Brown snapped her fingers  --  " like that . " <p> " Me , too . And I can do arithmetic good . " <p> " And Alfred was determined . He was serious . Once he came to school with the flu and we had to send him home . " <p> " When grampa died , I ran the farm all by myself . " <p> " Pooh , " scoffed Mrs. Brown . " If you had stayed on that farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets your age , " she continued , " if he wants to learn how to read , he has to have a thirst . Like a camel that smells water after a long trip across the blazing sands of the Sahara Desert . Learning to read is frustrating . Some days you get so mad , you want to quit . Now , this boy Alfred I mentioned , he loved music . He wanted his own saxophone . But it cost money and his mama had three other mouths to feed . So he had to get a job . Well , the man who owned the supermarket told Alfred if he learned to read he 'd give him a job . See ? " <p> Gerald was now on the edge of his seat . " I got a good reason for learning to read , Miss ! " <p> " You told me . " Mrs. Brown closed one eye like an old hoot owl . " To stop your parents from arguing about you . " <p> " That 's why I came today . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to learn to read . " He patted his pocket , then withdrew a small white booklet . " This is the real reason . " On her desk he laid a driver 's manual , stained and creased from folding . " My stepfather , he fix TVs and vacuum cleaners , and he say since I can already drive , if I get my license , I might can go with him sometimes . I got to learn to read so I can git me a license when I turn sixteen . " <p> Soberly , intently , tented fingers pressed against her lips , Mrs. Brown regarded Gerald like a cat watching a fledgling 's first attempts at flight . " That might do . " <p> " Please , Miss ! I know I can read that book today . " <p> Mrs. Brown eyed the clock . " We 'd be here after school ! " But at the boy 's pleading look , she opened her desk drawer and pulled out a work packet of white squares and a set of capital letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head as if in doubt . " I usually take three days with the regular kids . " <p> Gerald hitched his chair closer to the teacher . " I 'm ' a learn this system today . " <p> Mrs. Brown placed a big red M on her desk . " First of all , letters have sounds . This is Em . Listen . " Mmmmm . " She rubbed her stomach . " Like mmmm , good . Next we blend the letters with little words . " She laid a white square in front of Gerald . " The word on this card is AT . " She laid the M in front of the card . " Now say the sound of Em , mmmm , then say AT . " She pushed the M toward the AT card , " And you get mat . " <p> Gerald was flabbergasted . " Like a mat in gym class ? " <p> " A little word , " said Mrs. Brown , " but it can grow . Mat . MATCH , " more intensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked . " Why , that 's easy ! " Soon he had blended most of the letters with the AT card . " What 's next ? " <p> Mrs. Brown dealt him five AT cards , " We play cards . " <p> " Cards ? " <p> " To reinforce what you just learned . And , " she winked archly , " to spice things up a little . " She dealt herself five AT cards and piled the red letters on Gerald 's desk . <p> Then the teacher with a witch 's fingers and the boy with a farmer 's hands played cards . How she laughed to see that boy grunt and gasp and spit as he struggled to make lips , tongue , and teeth produce those little words . <p> With less effort did Hercules defeat Anteaus . <p> Finally Mrs. Brown tapped the book on Gerald 's desk . " Read page one . " <p> Nervously , Gerald smoothed the page . " Nat . Nat ... is ... ay cat . " Following his long brown finger , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat ... is ... ay ... FAT ... cat . " He looked up . For the first time he smiled , grinning as if he had just read the first page of a Dickens novel . " He sound just like my cat . He orange and real fat . And lazy . You like cats , Miss Brown ? " <p> At 3:20 Mrs. Brown was making a notation on Gerald King 's card . ' 2/19 . Read 30 pages , Book 1 . ' <p> There was a light tap on the door and Davida Davis appeared in the doorway with a sheepish look on her face . " I come to say I 'm sorry for actin ' up when that boy come in . " <p> " You 're forgiven . " <p> " He took a Book 1 . I just seen it in his back pocket . " <p> Mrs. Brown chuckled . " Rolled it up , did he ? " <p> " Yuup . When you gave me that book last year , I felt so stupid . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that real smart boy named Alfred pulled up four grades in a half a year , and I said I could , too . Remember ? " <p> Mrs. Brown smiled down at Gerald 's card . " I remember . " <p>
