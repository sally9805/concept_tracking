<p> THE biggest new church in Kiev is going up at a snail 's pace typical in post-Soviet Ukraine - bricks are hard to come by , and money is always a step behind wishes . <p> But the church and adjoining seminary were n't contracted by Ukraine 's predominant Orthodox or second-place Catholics . Instead , Baptists are already using the finished interior to hold services for a briskly growing roster of faithful . <p> " Last year we baptized 10,000 new members and opened 83 new churches and 70 prayer buildings in Ukraine . Ten years ago we were baptizing 10,000 across the whole Soviet Union , " says Hrihory Komendant , president of the All-Ukrainian Association of Evangelical Christians-Baptists . <p> Ukraine , he says , has the biggest and fastest-growing community of Baptists in the former Soviet Union , with about 7,500 churches and 500,000 members . <p> Increased religious tolerance in the final days of the Soviet Union cleared the way for denominations of all stripes to attract members over the past decade in Ukraine . <p> But economic misery and a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is particularly active here , an especially appealing alternative . <p> Seven out of 10 new Baptists have switched from other religions , attracted by its professional publicity campaigns , humanitarian aid , and hands-on approach to faith . <p> Vika Sai , a mother of two who attends the new church , said she converted to Baptism two years ago after a series of disasters in her life - a husband who beat her , illnesses in her family , and poverty - brought her to her knees . <p> Her mother , also a recent convert , prayed with her , and with God 's help her husband 's injured eye and daughter 's injured arm were healed , Ms. Sai said after a Tuesday night service , her eyes shining with tears of gratitude . <p> " I used to be Orthodox , but it 's not enough to wear a cross .

Mass services by visiting evangelists such as Billy Graham have also greatly raised the profile and reputation of Baptists across the Soviet Union . <p> Donations from abroad , particularly the United States , make up more than half of the Baptist church 's income in Ukraine .

When they hear God loves them , they 're taking advantage of it like you would n't believe , " he said . <p> Baptists and other " imported " religions have periodically come under fire from leaders of the 35 million-strong Orthodox church , who accuse them of luring away faithful and dividing the nation . <p> But the Orthodox church is currently involved in a bitter internal dispute - one branch is subordinate to a Kiev patriarch and the other to Moscow 's - and has little time to spare for other faiths . <p> The two Orthodox branches and 5 million Uniate Catholics are also slugging it out - sometimes literally - over property rights to churches that were boarded up or turned into museums for atheism in Soviet times . Uniate Catholics acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Baptists have been able to sidestep that conflict by building most of their own churches . <p> In fact , Baptist leaders say the church is as strong now as it has ever been , since the first recorded Baptist baptism in Odessa in 1861 . <p> " I would hesitate to say there is a boom of Baptists . But there is definitely a steady growth , " says Mykola Novichenko , who heads the religion department of the Ministry of Nationalities , Migration , and Faiths . " The Orthodox community is so turbulent and crisis-ridden right now that the Baptists provide a big contrast with their stability . Considering the hard times we 're having , that 's what attracts people . " <p> hinri Kyo 's gassing of the Tokyo subway in March . Nunn sent investigators to Tokyo after the attack .
