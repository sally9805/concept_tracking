<p> Not many schoolboy brawlers grow up to be Jesse Venturas . But in politics , as in wrestling , lots of people who start out small and unnoticed loom large and powerful as time goes on . <p> And so it is with society at large : Lots of discoveries or developments that seem insignificant at first trigger changes that lead eventually to major transformations in the way we live . <p> Here are a few of the most underreported such stories of the past decade , century and millennium , starting with the earliest and most far-reaching and ending with the most recent and localized . <p> The French and Indian War <p> Eclipsed in most history texts by the American Revolution , which started about 20 years later , the Seven Years ' War , as it was known in Britain and France , was a regional conflict that had enormous repercussions on both sides of the Atlantic . <p> First of all , ' By eliminating the French as an imperial presence on this continent , it ensured that English would be the predominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colorado history professor Fred Anderson , whose book on the subject , ' The Crucible of War : The Seven Years ' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America , 1754-1766 , ' will be published in February by Alfred Knopf . <p> Secondly , he says , by alienating the American colonists - who wanted to be seen more as comrades of the British than as subjects - it started the drive toward independence . <p> Third , by humiliating the French , it gave the colonists an ally without whom they could n't have won the revolution . <p> Finally , by bankrupting the French , it set in motion the chain of events that culminated in their own revolution and led to the reign of Napoleon , who changed the course of European history in the early 19th century . <p> And that 's not to mention what the Brits ' decisive victory did to a ) further their concept of an empire on which the sun would never set , and b ) deprive the Indians of French firepower , without which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Newburgh Address <p> While this country has witnessed assassinations and scandals galore , it has never experienced a military coup , thanks in part to George Washington . <p> In an incident rarely mentioned in civics classes , the general talked a group of disaffected colonial officers out of taking over the government in the spring of 1783 , when the country was still operating under the Articles of Confederation . <p> The officers - camped at Newburgh , on the Hudson River north of New York City - had gone months without being paid , and , suspecting that Congress might not settle their claims before demobilization , they had drawn up an eloquent , unsigned address urging direct action . <p> As Metropolitan State College history professor Tom Altherr tells the story , Washington got wind of this ' irregular invitation ' and rode overnight through a sleet storm to confront his subordinates , not knowing whether they would murder him or hear him out . Allowed to address the officers , Washington - 51 years old at the time - urged them to be patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've gone gray as a result of this war , and now I 'm going blind . ' <p> It was a lie , of course , but it drew the officers ' sympathy , defused the situation and deterred a mutiny that would have gravely imperiled the new republic . <p> Westward migration <p> The great westward migration of the 19th century was begun not by downtrodden Easterners seeking a better life , as generally believed , but by Protestant missionaries seeking to save the natives of the Oregon country . Delegations of Methodists , Presbyterians and Congregationalists , among others , began settling in the Willamette Valley south of Portland in 1834 - well before the Catholics arrived , and almost a decade before the Oregon Trail became clogged with wagon trains . <p> But while 500,000 people attempted to move west in the years 1841-69 ( an estimated 40 to 50 percent died on the trip or within a year later ) , Altherr points out that a far larger shift in population occurred in the 20th century . <p> In a similar period from the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western states grew by about 28 million - more than 50 times the increase in the 1800s . Sure , many of the newcomers were children of the baby boom , but their parents got there somehow , right ? <p> Gene research <p> Experimenting with sweet peas in the garden of his monastery , an obscure Austrian priest named Gregor Mendel theorized in the 1850s that certain properties now known to be carried by genes - like height - were either dominant or recessive . His work lay dormant for half a century , however , until scientists unearthed it in the search for answers to questions raised by the discovery of chromosomes . <p> Since then , genetics research has blossomed into a field with tremendous impacts on medicine , agriculture and forensic investigation , as anyone who 's heard of gene therapy , bioengineering and DNA testing is aware . <p> What has n't captured the public imagination , says Cheri Jones , curator of mammals at the Denver Museum of Natural History , is the potential for gene research to revolutionize fields as diverse as wildlife management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing a population of some threatened species into a new area , ' she explains . ' You might want to look at its DNA and match it with a species that 's closely related , as opposed to one that 's across the continent , to improve the chances for successful breeding . It sounds like real esoteric stuff , but it 's the kind of practical decision land managers have to make . ' <p> Similar matchups can also be made in the study of evolution , she notes , to determine how the DNA of an ancient organism may relate to a modern creature that may or may not have a similar outward appearance . <p> Freeways <p> It could be argued that the foundations of the modern freeway system were laid by the introduction of asphalt in the 1870s or Portland cement in the 1890s . But in truth , the notion of interstate highways was conceived by Dwight D. Eisenhower near the end of World War I , when he suffered through an excruciatingly long trip across the country as a young Army officer accompanying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II and his subsequent election as president in 1952 , however , that Eisenhower was able to translate his idea into legislation . The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 authorized $ 32 billion over 13 years for 41,000 miles of roads that would eventually cost three times as much and take three times as long to complete as originally anticipated . <p> The network of limited-access highways would spawn economic and social effects of far more consequence than the swift movement of men and materiel in a military crisis . <p> The freeways enabled trucking companies to displace railroads as the nation 's primary freight haulers , thus giving the United States ' the most efficient transportation system in the entire world , and allowing most of the country to share in the economic boom , ' according to Greg Fulton , president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association . <p> The system also changed Americans ' vacation habits , jump-started the tourist industry , standardized food and lodging services and - more troubling - split neighborhoods , encouraged white flight and accelerated suburban sprawl . <p> A. Philip Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin of the civil rights movement to the Montgomery bus boycott of the early 1950s , but arguably it was born decades earlier , when A. Philip Randolph founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in 1925 . <p> Randolph 's greatest triumph , perhaps , was a federal anti-discrimination order he elicited from President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 by threatening to stage a mass march on Washington to protest racist practices in defense-related industries . More than 20 years later , at the age of 74 , the pioneering black leader finally did direct such a march on Washington - the 1963 demonstration that gave rise to Martin Luther King 's famous ' I Have a Dream ' speech . <p> Changes in families <p> The single-parent family is enshrined in American life today , thanks to TV sitcoms . But for much of the latter half of the 20th century , it was overshadowed by images of the traditional nuclear family headed by a working father and stay-at-home mother . <p> Ironically , the same sort of lag in awareness may be occurring with regard to ongoing changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' typical ' family at the millennium is likely to take one of four alternative forms : the two-wage-earner family , the single-parent family , the blended family of remarriage , or the empty nest couple whose children have grown up and moved out , ' says University of Colorado sociology professor Patty Adler . <p> ' In addition to these forms , many people spend significant parts of their lives living apart from their families , as single young adults , divorced singles or older people who have lost a spouse . ' <p> As Americans struggle to cope with changes in gender roles , the world of work and age-related expections , she suggests , new family forms will emerge to give people ' a more creative , flexible and inclusive future than that contained in our monolithic family past . ' <p> Nukes <p> The most dangerous kind of fallout from the nuclear arms race of the Cold War years may not have been the small amount of radiation spewed into the atmosphere by early testing , but the widespread cynicism engendered by the secrecy that surrounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a matter of national security ' removed a whole sector of government operations from public scrutiny , ' notes University of Colorado journalism professor Len Ackland , former editor of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and author of a new book called ' Making a Real Killing : Rocky Flats and the Nuclear West ' ( University of New Mexico Press , $ 34.95 ) . <p> ' Huge arsenals were built in the ' 60s and ' 70s , yet there was n't even a public debate about it until the early ' 80s with the Nuclear Freeze Campaign , ' he says . ' Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex , but we do n't seem to have listened to him . ' <p> The upshot , Ackland argues , is a chilling lack of concern over the thousands of weapons still deployed ( or ready to be ) by U.S. and Russian forces , as well as those in the hands of China , India and other countries . As he puts it , ' Just because the Cold War has ended does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lasers <p> The design for the laser beam was patented in 1957 , the same year the Russians launched the first Sputnik satellite . But the first effective , working model did n't emerge until 1960 , when Denver native Theodore Maiman - son of the chief radio engineer for Mountain Bell - built one while working for Hughes Aviation . <p> Herb Hackenburg , a telephone historian and author of the book ' From Muttering Machines to Laser Beams , ' notes that lasers are familiar to the public because of their high-profile applications in eye surgery , computer printers and military targeting . But it is their crucial role in telecommunications , he adds , that may be most significant . Simply put , he explains , ' The fiber-optic network provides the road for the information highway , and the laser is what travels on that road , carrying all the digitized data . ' <p> Denver 's revival <p> At a local level , the ' absolutely breathtaking revitalization of Downtown Denver ' has occurred so gradually it 's gone almost unnoticed , says Jim Griesmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denver . <p> As an example of what can be accomplished through enlightened public and private planning , Griesmer maintains , Denver 's Downtown is unmatched even by similar facelifts in such cities as Chicago , Seattle and San Antonio . It 's so impressive , he says , that scores of professional city managers who attended an international meeting here two years ago remarked ' how taken they were ' with the city 's core . <p> The transformation began in the mid-1960s when Dana Crawford began renovating the run-down buildings that would become Larimer Square . It gained momentum in the ' 70s with the construction of the 16th Street Mall , Auraria campus , Denver Art Museum , the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and McNichols Sports Arena , and cruised through the ' 80s and ' 90s with a flurry of new skyscrapers , the convention center , the baseball stadium and a whole new restaurant district in LoDo . <p> ' The original goal , ' says Griesmer , ' was to bring shoppers back , but that was the Downtown of yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entertainment , living , cultural and financial opportunities .
