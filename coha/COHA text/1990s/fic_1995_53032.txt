He was a Tomb Robber . Well , when you were dead , you were dead . <p> All came to it . The mighty in their gold and gems , the impoverished unknown , wrapped in rags , their legs broken to fit the grave . And even he , Carem , would one day die . He did not mind if someone robbed him , after death . Welcome , my friend . <p> It was this life that counted . <p> Oh , he had been born as no one in the splendid city among the pink rocks . Noom Dargh , once the seat of kings , but no longer . He had been a whore 's son , sold at three months to be another whore . At ten , evading the man who was his owner  --  spuriously charming , as Carem had learned to be , they all trusted him  --  he made off with traders . He was quick as fire . Handsome too . <p> Among the traders he learned his profession . <p> The caravan routes went all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange bulbous stones , caught forever in mid-topple . " What is that place ?

No , not until they breached the stinking hotness of the rock and the bats , which laired there , poured outward  --  Then the man who liked Carem consoled him . " There 's nothing here to hurt you . But look  --  what 's that which shines ? " What shone was gold , contrary to so many proverbs . <p> By the time he was a man , Carem had gained much knowledge , and some wealth . Let it be said , the wealth came from others and the knowledge was all to do with thievery . But Carem did not harm the living . No , he was kind to them . He gave to beggars in the street , and was generous with the girls he dighted . <p> By his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Noom Dargh , a house with gardens and channels of water , a house with courtyards and dove-cotes , and awnings embroidered by gold . <p> He had also two wives , Bisint , who was rich , and Zulmia , who was beautiful . <p> In the city they spoke of him with respect . No one publicly remembered anymore what he did . Indeed , he did not do it , for now other men worked on his behalf , and brought him treasures by night through a secret walk in the starry garden . <p> Lucky Carem . A life from death . <p> One sunset as , half a mile away below his mansion , the city turned blood-red and the desert scarlet , someone came seeking Carem ; would speak only to him . <p> They met on a shady terrace and drank fig wine . <p> " I hurried straight to you , sir , " said the visitor , a traveler from antique lands . " You alone could do it . " <p> " Do what ? " <p> " Get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It needs knowledge of such things . " <p> " What things are they ? " <p> The traveler smiled . " They call yours a bestial career , but I say one does what one is good at . " <p> " You mean my shares in merchant enterprise . " <p> " No . Your tomb-robbery . " <p> Carem said , smiling too , " Have I been insulted ? " <p> " Not at all . You 're known as a master . And this , believe me , who would not dare it , needs a master 's touch . " <p> " You may explain . For purposes of amusement . If I laugh enough , you shall have gold to fill one hand , and sufficient silver to fill two . " <p> " Treble that . You will find you 'll laugh your head off , Lord Carem . " <p> Then the traveler spoke of an ancient country , once astride the world , and now come down to ruination . Its great obsession , this land , had been the burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many  --  in the most sumptuous and enduring manner . And , too , in deepest secret . Now and then one of these burial spots would be thought to have been discovered . Then everyone went mad . And , often as not , since they were usually also wrong , venturers came back with nothing but sore bones and empty wallets . <p> " This I have , however , " said the traveler , " is not only sure  --  and I can give you proof  --  it is infallible . Besides which , it is known . Spoken and dreamed of , a thing of sparkle and nightmare . " <p> " Is there the normal curse , then , on the tomb ? " asked Carem , indolently . Had he been a fox , his ears would have stood up high enough to touch the awning overhead . <p> " A curse known as familiarly as the tomb . Indeed , the tomb is named for it . There in the waste beyond the pastures of the River Khenemy . " <p> " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . So I 've been led to believe . " <p> " Not there . " <p> " The Garden of Arches , then ? That too . And only a wisp of gold got from it . " <p> " Not there . " <p> " More wine ? " inquired Carem . " A cake ? " <p> " Yes , I will take more wine . The burial place I offer you is the Tomb of the Black Dog . " <p> Then Carem , despite the last trace of the sunset , paled . His eyes opened and closed , and opened . He said , " Surely that is only a story . " <p> " Till now . Now it can be yours . " <p> " And your proof . " <p> Then the traveler took a purse out of his clothing and out of the purse he drew a narrow gleaming snake . This he set on the terrace , where , after two or three convulsive movements , it brought up out of its jaws a small black egg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler spoke a word that fell like a raw hot drop of unseasonal rain . <p> The egg burst , and there lay a tiny black figure of a dog at rest , its head erect , and its throat rimmed by gold . <p> " A copy of the image that guards the tomb ? " <p> " Found in the sand not twenty paces from the area . " <p> Muttering a protective charm , Carem picked up the figurine and held it . It was unearthly cold . He put it down . It east no shadow , turn it as he would . <p> " Tell me all you know , " said Carem . <p> The traveler did so . Presently much gold and silver was given over in handfuls . <p> At midnight they parted , the traveler and Carem , and Carem went prudently to sleep with his plain wife , Bisint , for in the morning be would be going away . <p> The Journey to Khenemy took several months , longer than was ordinarily needful , since Carem undertook the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeker of the shrines of the holy river . <p> Many tiresome days Carem spent , smothered by dust and ringing his irritating little pilgrim 's bell at the gates of collapsed temples , until at last , moved apparently by that mystic urge which drives prophets and seers , he wandered out into the desert waste . <p> The desert of Khenemy was like no other . <p> Where the River was , emerald pastures swelled , with cows and cameloids feeding beneath palms heavy with dates , and lime green banana trees . Then there lay the strips of fields , and sacred groves , and thereafter the first of the waste , brown as an egg where , in caves , the former inhabitants of old fallen cities lived , lighting at night their fires and lamps of horn , like yellow stars felled to the land . <p> After this , a place opened that was like hell . <p> The land was white , and blistered the soles through your boots , the sun was a ball of white matter , and the sky white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khenemy , which had passed away . Statue men a hundred feet tall , wielding swords of stone , towers and gateways that led nowhere , all blasted by a hot moistureless wind , the breath of something long dead . <p> Carem , though , had a map . Not to hand , but written accurately in his head . <p> So he trekked by day the burning waste , and slept by night under the suns of other indifferent worlds . And on the second evening , he reached a sort of cliff . And in the eastern front of it was a mark , that looked only natural , but not to him . It was like the face of a dog . <p> No time like the present <p> Carem went to the cliff and stared hard , and saw how the rock was . <p> Then he put up his agile right " lame " foot , and lifted himself . From the first step he discovered the second . They were set oddly , and were not safe . He negotiated them all , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Above , far up , the cliff was fiat as a stone table . <p> Once there , it was possible to look for miles , and see nothing but the nighttime desert , with here and there , one of its ghastly monuments . <p> Instead Carem looked and saw a hag seated by a round hole in the stone . <p> " Stay , " said the hag . " Let me tell you what you risk . " <p> " Very well , " said Carem . <p> " Once I was very young , " said the hag . " That might be said of all of us . " <p> " I traveled here , " continued the hag. humorlessly . " I sought to enter the Tomb of the Black Dog . Aieee ! I did not know . I thought it the burial place of some great king , guarded by that fearsome guardian , Anubar , the Biter of Souls . " <p> Carem nodded . <p> The hag said , " Know , it is the Tomb of the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He Himself lies buried here , that guardian invoked in so many other places . " <p> Carem shivered , but it was only the heat . <p> " Thus all of you died , granny , and you 're a ghost . " <p> " Nay , " said granny , " me alone He let live . But see , " and she opened her robe with her left hand to reveal horrid scars and omissions . " He tore off my right arm and my right breast . I am His warning " <p> " Thank you , " said Carem . " Now you have warned me you may be off . " <p> The hag got up and walked away . She cast no shadow . That too the Black Dog had tom from hir . She went down the cliff by another way , invisible to ordinary persons . <p> Oh , he was not alarmed . Not Carem . <p> He sat by the black hole in the stone and took a pipe from his garments . On this he blew . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ' journey away , at the spot to which he had earlier sent the men who would help him at the tomb . He had now merely to wait . <p> He first anointed himself from a phial , then stretched out in the hot night . The dead breath of the wind lulled him . He slept . <p> When the moon rose , the jingle of harness conveniently roused him again , and sitting up , he beheld the twenty men he had hired , who had gathered at the foot of the cliff . <p> Carem rose and poured onto the stone of the tomb some wine and oil . <p> " What are you doing ? " demanded one of the men below among the cameloids . <p> " Making the first offering , " said Carem . " Come up now , as I will direct you . " <p> Up they came . A mixed bag they were . Some aristocratic and anxious , others pure fresh scum . They crowded around him , and Carem pointed to the hole . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the tomb ? " <p> No one thrilled at the chance . <p> Carem said , " This gold piece , to the first . " <p> After this there were some offers . <p> Presently three men climbed down , one after the other . <p> " What do you see ? " <p> " Darkness . " <p> " Yes , that 's as it should be . " <p> Then Carem went down and the others followed him . <p> In the tomb , Carem struck a light , and lit a torch . <p> It was very hot , as Carem was well used to , but no bats laired there . Nothing lived in that enclosure . Not even a spider or a beetle . Bones there were , however , on the floor . <p> The walls were brown , and painted dimly by a massive figure that had the head of a long-nosed black dog . At this the crew pointed uneasily . <p> Carem drew from his clothes a small dark bottle . He spilled out its contents on the stone floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a map , in liquid , of the tomb . <p> Just at that moment came a low soft growl . <p> The hired men , most of them , bleated with alarm . <p> But , " It 's only magic , " said one . <p> " Exactly so , " said Carem . " You are meant to fear it and run away empty-handed . Think of the treasures that lie in the inner chambers . " <p> The men were somewhat consoled . They rubbed their amulets and muttered . <p> " Do you see that door , " said Carem , consulting his liquid map , " who will go through first ? " <p> There was great rivalry as to who would not . <p> While they argued something came rushing . <p> It was like a wind , or five hundred hounds , packed close as fish in a shoal , running after game . <p> The man nearest the door was one minute there , and then his head was off . It was wrenched from his shoulders . Next the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crotch . All this was done by an agency invisible . <p> With quick screams , and sometimes so swift there was no time for that either , the twenty men of Carem 's hire landed in pieces and bits on the floor , where the bones of previous victims lay . <p> But Carem , who had anointed himself with a certain thing repellant to all dogs , was not touched . <p> When the last man had had his throat tom out , a low satisfied growl rang round the space . <p> " Thus I make the second offering " said Carem . <p> Then he walked through the dark door without being molested , and through thirteen passages , right up to the farthest wall . There he kneeled and felt with his hands by the light of his torch . <p> Soon he made out a round door no higher than a child of three , and no wider than said child lying sideways . <p> Through that Carem crawled , and so entered the treasure vault . <p> There was just enough light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jewels , green and crimson , blue and white . But everything was on a little scale , even the emeralds no larger than a thumbnail , and the golden effigies of dogs and wolves , foxes and jackals , were the size of acorns and peach stones . <p> Carem filled the bags inside his clothes , his boots , his loin-pouch . He opened the ready purses at his neck and waist . He put things into his mouth , and up his nostrils , and in his ears , and elsewhere , which shall be nameless . <p> Take as you find . <p> On the wall of this last room , which was a sort of kennel , was painted no dog , but a black eye . Carem took no obvious notice of it as he screwed a ruby into his navel . Sucking a last golden standing jackal with diamond eyes between his lips , Carem crawled back out of the inner place . <p> He had accrued a great amount , yet a greater was left . Let that , then , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have reputation . That was worth a vaster amount than the stones themselves . <p> Back through the thirteen passages he waddled . In the outer passage he waddled . In the outer place , he stepped fastidiously over the bones . <p> He stood a moment listening . <p> Somewhere something howled , but it was , as usual , on the desert outside . <p> Carem climbed the rope , awkwardly , and emerged into the boiling air , which was itself like the interior of a grave . <p> On the table top of the tomb , huge black paw marks were apparent in the moonlight , and overhead the mass of stars seemed to describe , for a moment , the skull of a dog . <p> Carem pulled up the rope , and spoke a word . The entry to the tomb , the hole , vanished . <p> Below the cliff most of the cameloids had run off . But a few remained , trembling and farting with fear . He would sell them at a handy village . Well , a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff , Carem turned about on the sand , clanking and clinking from his weight of jewels and gold . <p> There on the smooth ground lay something black , pointing from him and away from the moon . He had kept his shadow . All was well . <p> On his return home , plain Bisint tactfully sent word that she was out of sorts , and beautiful Zulmia met Carem in the garden , plump as a white plum and garlanded with blue-black hair . Much joy he had of her , under the roses and lemon trees , while bees buzzed and the honeyed sun slowly set into the uncomplicated pink desert of Noom Dargh . <p> He did not tell Zulmia , or even Bisint , anything of his exploits , nor did he give them anything from his robbery . Instead he brought Zulmia a rope of pearls and sapphires to match her skin and eyes , and Bisint a rope of topaz to match her teeth . <p> The treasure of the tomb Carem sold carefully and meagerly . Soon nobles and lords sent word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings . He would be famous now . He would be feared as well as praised . <p> Zulmia approached her husband modestly . She told him , as if he , not she , had been clever , that she was with child . <p> " I am sure it 's a boy , masterful husband . Only a male would spring from your loins . " <p> Carem was pleased , for never before , to his knowledge , had he reproduced himself . <p> He looked delightedly at his lovely wife , plumper than ever , her hair like silk , and at her feet her jet black shadow . All was wonderfully well . <p> How charmingly the days and nights passed then . Even Bisint was helpful , often ailing , and keeping to her rooms . If she should die , all her wealth would come to Carem . <p> He would think now , upon sunny evenings , watching the final noose of light about the towers of the city below , how he might give up for good his profession . How he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare refuse him entry . His son , after all , should inherit a business , not merely an empire of robbery . <p> On the night of the full moon , eight months later , Bisint peacefully passed away . <p> In a generous spirit , Carem left her her topazes to be buried in . <p> It was midday , and beautiful Zulmia had gone into labor . From the arbor where Carem sat drinking pomegranate wine , the house was closely visible , and her screams of pain might now and then be heard . They were good , rounded , healthy screams . It seemed the birth was going perfectly . <p> Carem saw a woman approaching through his gardens . He took her for a servant bringing roast lamb and date leaves . He smiled and poured a little wine on the ground , an old custom , for the child to be . <p> Something caught Carem 's eye then . It was his fine dark shadow . How bold it was . How black . <p> Carem studied this . He noticed , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arbor trees , had caused his shadow to take on a peculiar shape . It had two upright ears . Its nose was very long . <p> As Carem was pondering this , the servant woman came up to him . She was not his servant , but a squat female , veiled , with the sun shining through her . Around her neck gleamed faintly a rope of yellow stones . <p> " I am your dead wife , " said Bisint 's uncomely ghost , unnecessarily . " I have arrived to warn you . " <p> " That was most kind . Of what ? " <p> " Hark . " <p> Carem harkened , and heard another loud scream from the house . <p> " Yes , " said Carem . " That is Zulmia . " <p> " Indeed , " said Bisint , " and she does well to scream . O stupid Carem , what did you bring away from the Tomb of the Black Dog ? " <p> It was random to lie to or upbraid a ghost . " Some trinkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O stupid Carem ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Only I , myself . " <p> " Stupid , stupid Carem , " emphasized Bisint , and disappeared . <p> Carem looked down for his shadow , that had pointed ears and a snout . It too had vanished . <p> A particularly awful scream rocked through the air . <p> Carem glanced at his mansion . <p> Zulmia 's windows , which were hung with crystal clear cloth , turned suddenly violently red . More , they appeared wet . <p> Then came other screams , the shrieks of women and the bawling of men . <p> A noted physician sprang suddenly out of the window . He fell down among the lemon trees . <p> Carem rose and went toward him . <p> " What , pray , goes on ? " <p> " Your wife is delivered , " said the physician . He had broken both his legs , but paid them no heed . His robe , like the window hangings , was soaked by blood . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Neither . I will tell you , " said the physician , " since I can not run away . Something tore itself from the womb of your wife , up out of her belly . It burst her like an orange . It was dark . It had a pointed snout . <p> Carem turned from the physician and gazed at the doorway of his house . <p> From the golden inner walk , something black was coming . It was tall and lean and moved lightly on its hind limbs . <p> Nothing had he brought from the Tomb of the Black Dog , save his loot and his body , with every aperture blocked . But one . One too small indeed to fill . And the shadow had gone with him . The shadow had run out of him , there among the roses . <p> From Carem 's doorway stepped Anubar , Biter of Souls . He was black as night , in the mid of day . His ears stood up , His snout was long . In His clawed paws lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like bracelets were wrapped the entrails of others . He ripped the physician 's body in half , m passing . Then stared at Carem , who bowed low and waited for death . <p> As well he might . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " Take a good look at the enemy , gentlemen .
