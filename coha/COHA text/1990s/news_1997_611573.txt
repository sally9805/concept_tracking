<p> A colossal shift in the Earth 's mass half a billion years ago caused continents to migrate rapidly from frigid polar regions to the steamy tropics , and vice versa , in a global upheaval that may help explain an astonishing sudden increase in the diversity of living creatures on the planet , scientists reported yesterday . <p> The dramatic discovery that the world 's geography rotated 90 degrees at the same historical moment when evolution suddenly accelerated was presented by researchers at the California Institute of Technology , who based their conclusion on an unprecedented analysis of the magnetic fields of rocks collected over 20 years worldwide . <p> If confirmed , the findings could provide a long-sought explanation for an event in Earth 's history known as the " Cambrian Explosion . " During this period the planet experienced a biological " big bang " that has never been repeated . New types of animals emerged at rates more than 20 times normal , leaving the first fossil records of virtually every sort of swimming , flying or crawling animal that exists today . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new findings , described in today 's issue of Science , indicate that the evolutionary surge coincided with an equally unique shift of the major landmasses , which briefly traveled at speeds hundreds of times faster than anything seen in recent history . Within the relatively short span of 15 million years , regions that had been at the north and south poles relocated to the equator , and two points on opposite sides of the equator became the new poles . <p> These massive changes would have produced traumatic alterations in regional climates and , the researchers theorize , could have broken up broad existing communities of creatures into smaller , more inbred ecosystems , where animals are known to evolve more rapidly and efficiently . <p> The idea that the geological upheaval might have influenced the biological one " just fits nicely , " geologist Joseph Kirschvink , who led the research , said in an interview . " It 's a radical idea , admittedly , but it can be tested . " <p> Geomagnetic studies of samples show that , beginning about 534 million years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South America , Africa , India , Australia , New Zealand , and other lands are derived ) rotated counterclockwise almost 90 degrees . In the same period , North America likewise migrated from a position near the South Pole to straddle the equator . <p> On the eve of this global movement , violent earthquakes had been tearing continents asunder and slamming them back together , throwing up towering volcanic mountain ranges at the seams . About 550 million years ago , Kirschvink speculates , there must have been a particularly large " crunch event " that sutured bits of many continents together while a huge chunk of seafloor sank , casting up a new volcanic range near the South Pole . <p> Like a wad of gum stuck on the underside of a child 's toy top , this huge cold slab of rock apparently was enough to throw the planet 's mass distribution off kilter . <p> Such an event apparently triggered a process known as " true polar wander , " which is quite different from the well-known ongoing process of movement in the Earth 's crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by heat convection inside the planet , which moves giant crustal plates a few inches per year , triggering earthquakes and volcanic activity . <p> By contrast , polar wander is driven by an imbalance in the planetwide distribution of mass relative to its spin axis . Any spinning body " tries " to place its fattest part at its equator , as is evident in the shape of a toy top . In Earth 's case , once the imbalance developed , the land masses apparently sped across the planet 's face at speeds well over several feet per year as the planet tried to " right " its balance . <p> " Earth has followed a ' plate-tectonic speed limit ' for the past 200 million years or so , " said CalTech graduate student David Evans , a co-author of the paper , " with nothing approaching the velocities needed for this early Cambrian reorganization . " ( Since then , it has been largely by means of the slower , heat-driven tectonic process that North America and the other continents have crept to their current stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambrian explosion of life is speculative . Existing life forms would have been forced to cope with rapidly changing climatic conditions , the team asserts , as tropical lands slid into the cold polar regions , and cold lands heated up . <p> The global shifts could have disrupted regional ecosystems , breaking them into smaller , more isolated communities , Kirschvink suggested . Studies have shown that " evolutionary innovations are much more likely to survive in a small inbreeding population , rather than in large , freely interbreeding groups , " he noted . <p> Even the slightest change in ocean currents can have a dramatic effect on regional climates , noted co-author Robert Ripperdan , a geochemist at the University of Puerto Rico . <p> The global shift could explain another mystery of the Cambrian period  --  large swings in the ocean 's record of carbon deposits , Ripperdan said . " No one could think of a mechanism " to explain this , he said . Under the new theory , " all of the evidence suddenly makes sense . " <p> If the ocean circulation system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geological record indicates , that would leave enough time for the process of natural selection to produce new animal adaptations , the researchers suggest . <p> " Then , wham ! They 're hit again and the process repeats itself , " Kirschvink said . " That is a great script for increasing diversity . " <p> Other scientists said the Kirschvink hypothesis is as startling , and as intriguing , as the theory that some kind of impact led to the extinction of the dinosaurs  --  a theory at first dismissed but now widely accepted . <p> " It sounds fascinating . . . but I 'm skeptical , " said paleontologist James Valentine of the University of California at Berkeley , who has specialized in the Cambrian Explosion . The idea " is certainly worth pursuing , " he said , but it does n't provide a specific mechanism by which animals suddenly evolved new " body plans . " <p> " This is incredible , " said planetary geologist James Head , of Brown University . " But let 's consider it , for sure . Our vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more recent history . The more potentially reasonable ideas we have to try to understand one of the most fundamental changes in the history of Earth the Cambrian period , the better off we are . " <p> Scientists have known for a half century that the solid exterior of a planet might move rapidly with respect to the spin axis . The solid mass actually revolves around the planet 's liquid core , while the spin axis remains fixed in space , relative to the sun and other planets . <p> To illustrate the principles involved , the researchers suggest cementing lead weights at opposite points on a basketball . Then try spinning the ball as it rests on one of the weights ( the south pole ) . The ball 's axis of rotation will migrate until the weights are spinning around the ball 's " equator . " <p> Kirschvink said the team had studied data collected since 1975 from most of the continents . They used ultrasensitive devices known as superconducting magnetometers to study the weak fossil magnetism left in rocks as they cool from molten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient geomagnetic field , like a compass pointing across the ages in the general direction of " ancient north " ; it also helps them estimate the ancient latitude in which a given sediment was deposited . ( The field " dips " toward vertical at the poles , but is horizontal  --  or parallel to the surface  --  at the equator . ) When the magnetic material points in another direction , the researchers note , this indicates that " the ground itself has moved in relation to Earth 's magnetic north , which is locked over time to the spin axis .
