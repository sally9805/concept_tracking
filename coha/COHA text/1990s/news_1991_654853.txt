<p> LI YUEHUA squints in the morning sunlight , reaches for a pole , and starts another warm spring day hanging out Hong Kong fashions for sale at his stall in Shenzhen 's popular East Gate free market . <p> It 's just after nine in this upstart southern Chinese city bordering Hong Kong , and crowds of bargain-seekers are already threading their way down the narrow lanes lined with vendors ' makeshift stands . <p> Running a hand through unkempt black hair , the lanky , **27;336;TOOLONG spots his first customers , a trio of gaudily dressed young women . <p> " Hey , little boy , " calls the sassiest of the three , who turn out to be performers with an itinerant song-and-dance troupe from Hunan Province . " Give me a discount on these pants , " she says with a teasing grin , lifting up a flouncy black skirt to try on the skin-tight blue tights . <p> After 20 minutes of haggling , the women leave with half a dozen pairs of the shiny leotardlike slacks . Li smiles over a comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Business has n't been too good lately , " says 17-year-old Li , who spends 12 hours a day , seven days a week , peddling pants with the Playboy logo , jean jackets emblazoned with the American flag , and other trendy outfits . <p> Like many youths forced to grow up a little too fast , Li comes across at first like a tough , street-wise adult . But away from the raucous market , he reverts to a teenager , full of the awkwardness and confusion of a boy uneasy with manhood . <p> He wears sports shirts and smart-looking jackets . TV dramas and news broadcast from free-wheeling Hong Kong are his favorites . But the veneer of sophistication fails to mask the xenophobic , traditional roots of a peasant youth who says he has never before spoken to a foreigner . <p> By day , Li leans back amid the bright , breezy racks of new clothing with a contented smile , drinking in the city 's energy as he might a cool glass of soda . But by night , when he returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help longing for the quiet green hills and terraced paddy fields back home . <p> Just a year and a half ago , Li left his parents , sister , and earthen-brick farmhouse in a village 150 miles northeast of Shenzhen and joined a growing army of 70 million peasant migrants in their march on Chinese cities . <p> The rural exodus began in the early 1980s , after China dismantled Mao 's communes and eased the hukou system that controlled residence , unleashing a vast store of surplus farm labor . <p> Meanwhile , the market-oriented policies of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping created high demand for unskilled manpower , especially in fast-growing coastal cities and pioneering " zones " for economic reform like Shenzhen . <p> Li , like most migrants , was compelled by the prospect of a job and cash wages to pull himself out of the morass of poverty and idleness at home . <p> " My family has no money . At home , we eat what we grow and only sell a little , " he says in the twang of his native Wuhua County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Guangdong Province . <p> Li 's parents sustained the family by growing rice , peanuts , and other crops on a small , quarter-acre plot . They raised chickens , pigs , and a water buffalo . Li played soccer and ping-pong with friends after school . <p> BUT few in Wuhua County , including Li , saw opportunities to get ahead , especially after the area was ravaged by a major flood in 1986 . <p> " Everyone in my hometown is heading out , " he says . <p> After a disappointing failure in the high school entrance exam , Li and his older brother pocketed the modest family savings and caught a bus south for Shenzhen . At the border that fences off the 327-square-kilometer ( 126-square-mile ) economic zone from the rest of China , they acquired a pass from police and crossed into the city , awed by its skyscrapers and luxury hotels . <p> The brothers quickly set up shop in the free market , joining hordes of vendors , repairmen , construction workers , and other migrants encamped in Shenzhen , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 620,000 permanent residents . <p> Today , Li can claim moderate success . He clears $125 a month at the clothing stall , making him wealthy by Chinese standards , though not in Shenzhen , which boasts the country 's highest annual per capita income at $2,000 . <p> He earns enough to dress well , pay the rent , see a couple of movies a month , buy kung-fu novels , and send $50 home to his parents from time to time . <p> The southern boomtown is a feast for Li 's curious , active mind . Unlike back home , where he rarely saw newspapers , here he reads them every day and " knows all about the Gulf war . " <p> With a new-found independence from the Confucian , patriarchal ways of the village , Li says he will make his own decisions on marriage and future jobs . <p> " I listen to myself , not to my parents , " he says . <p> But Li 's life also reflects the hardship , alienation , and insecurity of peasant migrants as they form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his early morning and late-night hours in a crowded slum , where he lives with at least 10 other migrants in a sweltering , corrugated-tin shack built on the roof of a three-story tenement . In a tiny , dark room shared with his brother and a distant cousin , Li sleeps on a straw mat laid over a wooden board supported by two saw horses . Unlike those of other migrants , his bed lacks mosquito netting . On the wall hangs a yellow cap and a worn guitar , the only nonessential item in the room . <p> Li cooks simple meals of rice gruel with bits of meat and vegetables on a kerosene stove in the hall . Until a spigot was rigged up recently , the hovel had no plumbing and Li washed with water hoisted by bucket from a nearby well . <p> Public toilets are a five-minute walk away . Raw sewage and putrid debris lie scattered in the gutters and concrete walkways below . The shack is noisy with sounds of cooking , washing , and babies crying . <p> Long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the free market , where fierce competition among vendors puts a limit on camaraderie . Trust is also hard to come by , as crimes like theft and fraud run rampant through the shifting migrant community . <p> " It 's a little lonely here , " a boyish Li confides . <p> Sitting on a stool in his stall under the glow of a fluorescent light , he seems to grow numb watching the shoppers pass as darkness falls on the marketplace . <p> " This job is much harder than studying , " he says with a tired voice . " Sometimes I miss home and my best friends . "
