Chapter One&lt; Charlie , you son of a bitch , you always did have a warped sense of humor . How the hell could you do this to me ? Joel Blackstone stood at the back of the tiny church and surveyed the cluster of mourners gathered in the front pews . September sunlight filtered down through the stained-glass windows illuminating the inside of the A-frame structure with a glow . The minister 's voice was strong and surprisingly cheerful , given the fact that he was officiating at a memorial service . " Charlie Thornquist was the most dedicated fisherman I ever knew , " the minister said . " And that 's saying something , because God knows I 've done a pretty fair job of dedicating myself to that noble pursuit . But for me it was an avocation . A hobby . For Charlie it was nothing less than a true vocation . A calling . " At the minister 's right , an urn rested on a wooden stand . The small brass plaque that hung on it was engraved with the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of Joel 's eighty-five-year-old boss , Charlie Thornquist . Several photographs of Charlie with some of his prize catches were displayed around the urn . The most impressive was the one of Charlie with a marlin he 'd landed off the coast of Mexico . Joel still could not believe that the old bastard had ripped him off in the end . After all that talk of letting Joel buy him out in another year , Charlie had stiffed him . The company Joel had built from the ground up had gone to the daughter of Charlie 's nephew . Ms. Letitia Thornquist was a librarian at some little midwestern college in Kansas or Nebraska or some equally foreign locale . The hell with it . Thornquist Gear belonged to him , Joel Blackstone , and he was damn well not going to allow it to fall into the grubby little palm of some ivory tower type who did n't know a balance sheet from an unabridged dictionary . Joel 's insides tightened with anger . He had been so close to owning Thornquist free and clear . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Joel who had poured everything he had into the firm for the past ten years , Joel who had single-handedly turned it into a major player in the marketplace . And it was Joel who had spent the past eight months plotting a long-awaited vengeance . But to carry out his revenge , he needed to retain complete control of Thornquist Gear . One way or another , Joel thought , he was going to maintain his hold on the company . The little librarian from Iowa or wherever could go screw herself . " We have gathered here today to bid Charlie Thornquist farewell , " the minister said . " In some ways it is a sad moment . But in truth we are sending him into the loving hands of the master fisherman . " We had a deal , Charlie . I trusted you . Thornquist was supposed to be mine . Why the hell did you have to go and die on me ? Joel was willing to concede that Charlie probably had not intentionally collapsed from a heart attack before changing his will as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie had a way of letting business slide in favor of fishing . He had always been good at that . This time good old Charlie had let things slide a little too far . Now , instead of owning Thornquist Gear , the rapidly expanding Seattle-based company that specialized in camping and sporting equipment , Joel had himself a new boss . The thought was enough to make him grind his back teeth . A librarian , for God 's sake . He was working for a librarian . " For most of his adult life Charlie Thornquist enjoyed one driving passion . " The minister smiled benignly on the small group . " And that passion was fishing . For Charlie Thornquist , it was not the actual catch that counted , but the communion with nature that accompanied each and every fishing trip . Charlie was happiest when he was sitting in a boat with a pole in his hand . " That was true enough , Joel reflected . And while Charlie had gone off to fish , Joel had sweated blood to transform Thornquist Gear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and hungry shark that was on the verge of swallowing whole its first live prey . Charlie would have appreciated the analogy . Joel narrowed his eyes against the golden glow filtering through the colorful windows . He studied the trio in the front pew . He bad already met Dr. Morgan Thornquist , thanks to Charlie . Morgan was a full professor in the department of philosophy and logic at Ridgemore College , a small private institution in Seattle . Morgan had been raised on a midwestern farm , and some of his past still showed in his sturdy frame and broad shoulders . But nothing else about Morgan reflected his early years as a farm boy . He was in his early fifties and , according to Charlie , had lost his first wife five years earlier . With his bushy brows , a neatly trimmed gray beard and an air of academic pomposity , Morgan perfectly suited Joel 's image of a college professor . Joel had nothing against Morgan . On the couple of occasions when they had met , the man had been gracious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying Morgan Thornquist was highly intelligent . The same could be said of his current wife , the tall , ice-cool , very pregnant blonde seated on Morgan 's right . Stephanie Thornquist was , by aft accounts , just as brilliant as her husband . Forty years old , she was a professor in the department of linguistics at Ridgemore College . There was no denying Stephanie was a striking woman . Her features were patrician , her figure tall and elegant , even in pregnancy . Her silver-blond hair was cut in a very short , very sleek , very angular style that was at once modern and timeless . Her cool blue eyes reflected the same serene intelligence one noticed in her husband . Having at least made the acquaintance of Morgan and Stephanie , Joel had a fair idea of what to expect from them . They were neither a direct threat nor a mystery . His new boss , on the other hand , was both . Joel 's gaze slid almost reluctantly to the young woman seated on Morgan Thornquist 's left . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to the experience . From where he was standing he could not see her face very clearly , mostly because she kept sniffling into a huge hankie . Ms. Thornquist was the only one in the small crowd who was crying . She did so with some enthusiasm , Joel noticed . Joel 's first impression of the new owner of Thornquist Gear was that she bore no resemblance whatsoever to her stepmother . Instead of being tall , elegant , and blond , she appeared to be short , rumpled , and definitely not blond . In fact , the thick , wild mane of honeyed brown hair was the first thing Joel really noticed about her . She had made an obvious effort to anchor the unruly mass in a severe topknot , but the entire affair was already slipping its mooring . Tendrils of hair had wriggled free of the gold clip and gone exploring on their own . Some dangled down the soft nape of her neck ; others were darting playfully over her brows and curled down her cheeks . Charlie had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie had also mentioned the name of the college where she worked as a librarian , but Joel had since forgotten . He tried to recall the name of the institution  --  Valmont or Vellcourt , something like that . At that instant Letitia Thornquist turned around and saw him watching her . Joel did not look away as she peered at him through a pair of round tortoiseshell frames . Her eyes were large and curious . The little round glasses and the high arch of her dark brows combined to give her a look of wide-eyed innocence . It reminded Joel of the expression on the face of an inquisitive young kitten . She frowned thoughtfully at Joel , apparently trying to figure out who he was and what he was doing there . He realized with a small shock of interest that she had a nice full mouth . He also noticed that the jacket of her suit appeared to be rumpled , at least in part , due to a certain roundness of her figure . She was not the least bit heavy , he saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a certain earthy sensuality about her . This was the kind of woman men secretly pictured in their minds when they thought of home and hearth and babies . Joel groaned inwardly . As if he did not have enough problems on his hands . Now he had to figure out how to do business with a bright-eyed innocent who looked as if she should be toiling over a hot stove with a couple of toddlers playing around her feet . On the other hand , he told himself encouragingly , if Letitia Thornquist was what she appeared to be  --  a naive midwestem librarian  --  he should be able to handle her . He would make her the same offer he had made Charlie . With any luck Ms. Thornquist would jump at the chance to get rich in a few months and hop the next plane back to Kansas , or wherever it was she came from . There was supposed to be a fianc in the picture somewhere , Joel belatedly recalled . He was sure Charlie had mentioned her recent engagement . Joel was checking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornquist turned her attention back to the minister , who was concluding the service . " Charlie left this world while engaged in the activity he loved best , " the minister concluded . " Not all of us are thus privileged . His family and friends will miss him , but they can take satisfaction in knowing that Charlie lived his life the way he wished . " Joel gazed at the urn . I 'm going to miss you , you old son of a gun , even if you did throw a monkey wrench into everything at the end . Joel watched with interest as Letitia opened her black bag , removed another large hankie , and blew her nose . She shoved the handkerchief back into her purse and tried to straighten her suit jacket with an unobtrusive movement . It was a useless effort , Joel concluded as he watched . It was obvious Letty was one of those people who could not put on a suit without having it look rumpled inside of five minutes . As if again aware of his gaze , Letty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came straight out of the blue , Joel found himself wondering if she wore that same expression of intent curiosity when she was in bed with a man . He could just imagine her surprise when she reached her climax . The thought made him smile . He realized it was the first time he had done so in days . " Let us all observe a moment of silence as we wish Charlie Thornquist an endless fishing trip . " The minister bowed his head , and everyone else followed suit . When Joel looked up again , he saw the minister hand the urn to Morgan Thornquist . The small group in the pews rose and started down the aisle toward the front of the small church . Morgan and Stephanie paused to talk to a couple of the other mourners . Joel kept his eye on Letitia , who was reaching for another hankie . When she opened her purse , two of the large pile of used handkerchiefs popped out and fell to the floor . Letitia bent over to retrieve them from under the pew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derriere . The movement also tugged her blouse free of her skirt band in back . It was then that he decided Ms. Letitia Thornquist was going to be merely an inconvenience , not a major problem . On impulse he started down the aisle toward the pew where Letitia was on her hands and knees searching for the lost hankies . " I 'll get that for you , Ms. Thornquist . " Joel came to a halt , bent down , and scooped up the damp handkerchiefs . He handed them both to Letitia , who was still crouched between pews . She looked up in astonishment and Joel found himself gazing down into a pair of huge , intelligent sea green eyes . " Thank you , " she murmured , struggling to get to her feet and straighten her skirt and jacket at the same time . Joel stifled a sigh . He grasped her arm and hoisted her up . He realized she felt light but surprisingly strong . There was a healthy , vibrant quality about her . " Are you all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always cry at funerals . " Morgan Thornquist ambled over , smiling . " Hello , Joel . Glad you could make it . " " I would n't have missed Charlie " s funeral for the world , " Joel said dryly . " I understand . Have you met my daughter ? " Morgan inquired . " Letty , this is Joel Blackstone , Charlie 's chief executive officer at Thornquist Gear . " Letty 's eyes were brilliant with curiosity and a hint of excitement . " How do you do ? " " Fine , " Joel said shortly . " Just great . " Morgan looked at him . " You 'll come out to the cabin with us , wo n't you ? We 're going to have a couple of drinks and dinner in honor of Charlie . " " Thanks , " Joel said , " but I had planned on driving back to Seattle tonight . " Stephanie walked over to join the small group . " Why do n't you spend the night with us , Joel ? We have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks and dinner . " What the hell , Joel thought . It would give him a chance to see just what he was going to be up against in the form of Ms. Letitia Thornquist . " All right . Thanks . " Letty was frowning thoughtfully . " You 're my uncle 's chief executive officer ? " " Right . " Her eyes skimmed somewhat disapprovingly over his black windbreaker , jeans , and running shoes . He knew the precise instant when she noted the absence of a tie . " Were you in a hurry to get here , Mr. Blackstone ? " she asked politely . " No . " He smiled faintly . " I dressed for the occasion with Charlie in mind . I worked for him for nearly ten years , and I never once saw him with a tie . " Morgan chuckled . " Good man . Charlie was always telling us how useful you were . He claimed it was solely because of you that he got to spend the past ten years fishing full-time . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornquist off his shoulders , " Joel murmured . " I know you did . I 'm sure you and Letty are going to work very well together , too , " Morgan announced . " You two have obviously got a great deal to discuss . " " Dad , please , " Letty said , " this is hardly the time or place to talk about business . " " Nonsense , " Morgan retorted . " Uncle Charlie would not have wanted us to get maudlin . And you and Joel need an opportunity to get to know each other . The sooner the better . Letty , why do n't you come on back to the cabin in Joel 's car ? You can give him directions , and the two of you can introduce yourselves properly . " Joel saw the uncertainty in Letty 's eyes as she considered that proposition . He decided then and there that the best way to handle his new boss was to save her the difficulty of having to make challenging decisions all by herself . " Good idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Letty 's arm and started toward the church steps . " My Jeep is parked right outside . " " Well ... " Letty 's eyes darted quickly back and forth between her father and Joel . " If you 're sure you do n't mind ? " " I do n't mind at all . " Just as Joel had anticipated , his own decisiveness seemed to make up Letty 's mind for her . Clutching her black shoulder bag , she allowed him to draw her along in his wake . No sweat , Joel thought . This was going to be like taking candy from a baby . Charlie had been just as easy to handle in his way . Right up until the end , that is , when good old Charlie had screwed him over royally . " Ouch , " said Letty . " You 're hurting my arm . " " Sorry . " Joel forced himself to relax his fingers . Charlie , you bastard , how could you do this to me ? Letty sat uneasily in the passenger seat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the blacktop road that ran along the small river gorge . She her purse firmly in her lap and slanted her new CEO an assessing sidelong glance . She was puzzled by the tension she sensed in Joel Blackstone . Granted , funerals were emotional occasions , but this was more than the somber mood one would have expected at the loss of a boss . There was a restless impatience in Joel Blackstone . Letty could feel it . It burned in his tawny eyes and vibrated along every line of his lean , hard body . He seethed with it , although he was masking it well beneath a layer of cool self-control . There was anger burning in him , too . Letty could feel it , and it sent a shiver down her spine . Angry men were dangerous . The sense of potentially explosive power in Joel was underlined by the fiercely molded planes and angles of his face . It was a savage face , Letty thought , a face that reflected the ancient hunting instincts that by rights should have lain deeply buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much too close to the surface in Joel Blackstone . She guessed he was in his mid-thirties , thirty-six or thirty-seven , perhaps . Something about him looked and felt far older , however . Letty was torn between a nearly overwhelming curiosity and an equally strong sense of caution . She had never met a man who managed to make her wary in quite this manner . It was a primitive sensation . " How long did you work for my great-uncle , Mr. Blackstone ? " she finally asked politely when the silence got to be oppressive . " Nearly ten years . " " I see . " Letty moistened her lips . " He , uh , spoke highly of you . Said you were very sharp . He thought you had a certain instinct for business . " " Yeah . I had an instinct instead of an M.B.A . " Joel flashed her a brief amused glance . " He spoke highly of you , too , Ms. Thornquist . Said you were a bright little thing . " Letty winced . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always treated it with a sort of indulgent condescension . " " He was a self-made man . He did n't think too much of the ivory tower life . " " And neither do you , I take it ? " With effort , Letty kept her tone polite . " Charlie and I had a few things in common . That was one of them . " Letty pursed her lips . " Not exactly . I think you feel actual disdain for it . Charlie was not disdainful . " " Is that right ? " Joel did not sound particularly interested . " Charlie raised my father after my grandparents died . It was Charlie who financed Dad 's education all the way through graduate school , you know . So you see , he could n't have been completely disdainful of the academic life . " Joel shrugged . " Charlie believed in letting people do what they wanted with their lives . All he asked was that they leave him alone so that he could go fishing as often as possible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " So much for trying to ease the tension with idle conversation , Letty thought . She wondered what sort of woman Joel Blackstone dated . Surely if he had a wife he would have brought her to the funeral . Whoever his woman was , she would have to be a very sensual creature , Letty decided . A man like Joel would want a woman who could respond to him in a very physical way . Of course , she reminded herself , most men wanted that sort of woman . Even Philip , whom she 'd thought would not be quite so demanding , had needed a more responsive woman . It was fortunate for all concerned that she had discovered that fact during their engagement rather than after the marriage had taken place . " How long will you be out here on the Coast , Ms. Thornquist ? " " You may call me Letty . " " Sure . Right . Letty . How long ? " " I do n't know yet . " Some of Joel 's superficial control dissolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience Letty sensed churning inside him . " What do you mean , you do n't know ? " Joel glowered at the narrow , winding road through the Jeeps windshield . " Do n't you have to get back to that college where you work ? " " Vellacott ? " " Yeah , Vellacott , or whatever . Do n't you have to get back to your job ? " " No . " " But Charlie said you worked in the library there . " " I did . Reference desk . Nearly six years . " Letty gripped the dashboard . " Would you mind slowing down a little . " " What ? " Joel threw her a scowl . " I said , would you mind slowing the car a little , " Letty repeated carefully . " Your father 's already pulling ahead of us . Nice car , by the way . " Letty glanced at the red Porsche convertible . it was moving swiftly , clinging to the twisting road like a limpet . Morgan had the top down , and Stephanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephanie looked good in white , Letty reflected . It suited her ice-maiden beauty . " The Porsche belongs to Stephanie , " Letty said . " My father drives a BMW . " Joel cocked a brow . " You sound as if you disapprove . Got something against nice cars ? " " No . It 's just that it 's a little odd to have a stepmother who drives a candy red Porsche , " Letty admitted , " when the most exciting thing I 've ever driven is a Buick . Please slow down . You do n't have to worry about getting lost . I know how to get to their house . " Joel eased his foot off the accelerator . " You 're the boss . " Letty smiled , pleased at the sound of that . " Yes , I am , are n't I ? It feels very strange , you know . " " Inheriting a company the size of Thornquist out of the clear blue sky ? Yeah , I can see where that might feel a little weird . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me , Letty , do you have any experience in the business world ? " " No , but I 've read a great many books and articles on the subject since I learned that Great-Uncle Charlie left me Thornquist Gear . " " Books and articles , huh ? You know , Letty , there 's quite a difference between the business world and an academic environment . " " Is there ? " She studied the scenery . Twilight came early in the Cascades , she noticed . The heavily forested terrain was already turning dark and mysterious as the last of the sun disappeared . She was accustomed to wide open spaces and gentle rolling hills . These wild , aggressive mountains were a bit overpowering . Just like Joel Blackstone . " A world of difference , " Joel said pointedly . " I do n't know if Charlie ever mentioned it to you , but he and I had a sort of unofficial understanding . " " Did you ? " " I was going to buy him out in another year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidelong glance . " That 's right . Look , I know it 's a little too soon to talk about it , but I want you to know I 'm still prepared to go through with the deal . I 'll continue to run the company for the next year , just as I have for the past ten years . Then , when I 've got the financing in place , I 'll cash you out . How does that sound ? " " The turnoff is up ahead on the right . " Joel 's jaw tightened . " Thanks . " He slowed the Jeep and obediently turned off the river road onto an even tinier one that led into the trees . The structure of glass and wood at the end of the lane was a cabin in name only . By anyone 's standards it was a lovely and expensive home . " You can park behind the Porsche , " Letty said . " Nice place , " Joel said , casting a knowledgeable eye over the sleek lines of the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porsches and weekend cabins like , this . " " My father is one of the country 's leading experts on medieval philosophy . By temperament and training , he is himself a fine logician . My stepmother has written some of the most important papers being published today on syntactic and semantic analysis . " " So ? " Letty was amused . " So they are both brilliant analytical thinkers . It gives them an edge when it comes to making financial investments . " " I 'll keep that in mind the next time I want some advice on the stock market , " Joel said . He opened the Jeep door and got out . Then he started around the hood to open Letty 's door . Letty saw what was happening and scrambled out on her own . She did not want Joel getting the impression that just because he worked for her , he was expected to wait on her hand and foot . She had a feeling things were going to be difficult enough as it was between herself and Joel Blackstone . Letty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . " Can I help ? " she offered , already knowing what the answer would be . " No , thank you , Letty . " Stephanie smiled her cool , serene smile as she peeled shrimp . " Everything 's under control in here . Why do n't you go out and visit with your father and Joel ? " Everything was always under control with Stephanie . Letty wondered what it would take to ruffle the glassy smooth surface of her stepmother 's glacial poise . " All right . If you 're certain there 's nothing I can do . " " I 'll call you if I need you , " Stephanie promised . " Well , if you insist . What are you preparing ? " " Black linguini with shrimp and mussels . " Letty blinked . " I do n't believe I 've ever had black linguini . Do they use food coloring to make it black ? " " Heavens no . " Stephanie looked startled . " Squid ink . " " Oh . " Letty retreated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , because she would not want anyone else in her pristine , orderly world . Too much risk of a mess , no doubt . Stephanie was a gourmet cook . This did not surprise Letty , because she had learned very quickly that everything Stephanie did , she did with a high level of expertise . What amazed Letty about Stephanie 's cooking was that she turned out truly exotic fare without creating so much as a ripple of disorder on the surfaces of her steel and white tile kitchen . Morgan was talking to Joel near the seven-foot windows when Letty entered the living room . He glanced at his daughter . " Ah , there , you are , my dear . We were just about to open a bottle of Yakima Valley sauvignon blanc . I think you 'll like it . " He turned to Joel . " Letty has n't spent much time out here in the Northwest yet . We 're trying to educate her palate  --  " " I am told Seattle is a foodie town , " Letty said dryly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we like to eat . And we like to eat well . " " So I have been given to understand . All right , Dad . I 'm ready to try your latest discovery . " Letty sat down on one of the white leather sofas . She noticed Joel stayed near the window , gazing out over the night-darkened forest . " This one is a genuine find , I 'm pleased to say . " Morgan went to work at the small bar built into the far end of the living room . " Great depth and finesse . Very subtle . Quite sophisticated , actually . " " Sophisticated " was a word Professor Morgan Thornquist would never have applied to a bottle of wine in the old days . Letty was still coming to terms with the changes she was witnessing in her father . Some of them were good , she conceded . He had shed the extra twenty pounds he had carried for as long as Letty could remember , and he 'd given up his pipe . He looked healthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . There was no denying he was thriving out here in the Pacific Northwest . For the most part Lefty was happy for him . But as far as she was concerned , the decision to start a second family at Morgan 's age was taking things too far . She still could not believe she was going to have a baby brother soon . " Here we go . " Morgan drew the cork from the bottle with a flourish . " Excellent color , do n't you think , Joel ? Letty , let me have your glass . " Letty got up and handed her father the long-stemmed wineglass . Morgan filled it before setting it down on the lacquered Art Deco coffee table in front of the sofa . " None for Stephanie , of course , " Morgan said . " She wo n't touch alcohol again until after Matthew Christopher is born . How about you , Joel ? " Joel , who was standing near the window , studying the magnificent view , glanced at the wine bottle . " Any beer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kept the refrigerator stocked with Charlie 's favorites . You know how he liked his Northwest-brewed beer and ale . " He raised his voice . " Stephanie my dear , would you bring Joel a bottle of that good ale we picked up last month at that new brewery in north Seattle ? " Stephanie appeared almost immediately in the doorway with a bottle and a glass . " Here you are , Joel . " " Thanks . " Joel ignored the glass and accepted the bottle . " To Charlie . " He took a long swallow . " To Charlie . " " To Charlie . " " To Charlie . " Letty took a sip of the sauvignon blanc and surveyed the platter of vegetables that sat in the center of the lacquered table . She was familiar with most of them , although she noticed one or two odd-looking items . She dunked a peapod in the dip . " What is this ? " she asked politely . " I do n't recognize the flavor . " " That 's a tahini- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you like it ? " " Very interesting , " Letty said . She moved on to a little dish of deep red spread surrounded by crackers . " And this ? " " Just a little something I make using sun-dried tomatoes . I 'll give you the recipe if you like . " " Thank you , " Letty said formally , aware that everyone was watching her with varying degrees of amusement . " Do you like sashimi ? " Joel asked a little too politely . " Back home we bait fish hooks with sashimi , " Letty said . Morgan laughed indulgently . " Everyone eats sushi and sashimi out here on the Coast . Is n't that right , Joel ? " Joel nodded slowly , his eyes on Letty . " There are sushi bars on every third corner from here to Vancouver . And the corners that do n't have sushi bars usually have Thai restaurants . But I imagine Letty prefers beef . " Stephanie looked immediately concerned . " Oh , dear , Letty , you are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red meat anymore . " " Well , we do n't eat a lot of raw fish back in Indiana , either . I read an article that said there 's a risk of worms in raw fish . They cause a very unpleasant illness that can be extremely difficult to cure . " " Nonsense , " Stephanie said as she started back into the kitchen . " Statistically , the chances of getting contaminated fish are extremely small if one is careful to eat in good quality restaurants . " Morgan looked at Letty . " Why do n't you tell us what your plans are now that you have your own business ? " " Actually , I 've been giving that a lot of thought . " Letty paused to take another sip of wine . She could literally feel the seething tension vibrating close to the surface again in Joel . He had clearly gone on high alert . She realized with a trickle of dread that she had never been more aware of a man in her life . It was a very disconcerting sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been thinking , " Joel said softly , his eyes intent . " I 've come to the conclusion that I need to make a few changes in my life , " Letty murmured . " This inheritance from Great-Uncle Charlie could not have come at a better time . It might almost have been fate . On the plane trip out here I decided not to go back to Vellacott . " Morgan looked astonished , but vastly pleased . " Well , well , well . I 'm glad to hear it . You 're not normally the impulsive type , my dear . What were these changes in your life that you made on the spur of the moment ? " Letty munched a sliver of toast slathered with sun-dried tomato spread . " I 've broken off my engagement to Philip , I 've quit my job , and I 've decided to move to Seattle and take over the reins of Thornquist Gear . " The sharp crack of glass exploding on hard tile drew everyone 's attention . Letty glanced across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that he had dropped his bottle of ale . Joel looked up from the shards that glittered at his feet . His eyes burned like those of a tiger in the night as he stared straight at Letty . " Sorry , " Joel said very softly , his tone devoid of any emotion . " An accident . Do n't worry . I 'll clean it up . "
