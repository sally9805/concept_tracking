Kings are for nations in their saddling clothes .  --  Victor Hugo Anybody glancing at the television talk shows over the last four or five months would have been hard-pressed to escape the grinning presence of H. Ross Perot , the would-be captain of the American soul who promotes himself  --  to Larry King and Jay Leno and Charlie Rose and the folks at NBC news  --  as a political masterpiece . The performance is like that of the crow in Aesop 's fable who thinks it can sing as sweetly as the nightingale , but it draws a crowd , and the crowd grows larger and more attentive as President Bill Clinton 's approval ratings drift lower in the public-opinion polls . When not otherwise promised to a television host , Perot travels to Washington to teach the Congress the lessons of good government that he learned from his long and careful study of the works of Norman Rockwell . Again the spectacle is grotesque , but what is more grotesque is the deference of the politicians who applaud his screeching as if it were the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February and early May Perot testified before three congressional committees , and he invariably arrived with a claque of true believers who occupied the back rows of the hearing rooms and provided the silent veneration and spontaneous applause . Also invariably , Perot addressed the members of the committees as if they were schoolchildren arraigned on disciplinary charges before a headmaster determined to make them say their prayers and drink their milk . He established the pose in early March , for the benefit of a committee considering the possibility of congressional reform . Instead of addressing the questions at hand , Perot delivered his standard lecture about a corrupt government squandering the nation 's treasure on idle luxuries and useless toys . Portraying the servants of that government ( among them all the politicians present in the hearing room ) as a crowd of spendthrift fools , he recited his familiar list of complaints about the deficit , foreign lobbyists , extravagant expense accounts , private gymnasiums , idiot welfare programs , cut-rate haircuts , and preferred parking spaces at Washington 's National Airport . He ended the lecture with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress continued to misbehave and failed to heed his sound advice , then on election day the great , good American people would drive them from the temple . Perot knew that this was so because the great , good American people had appointed him their champion and surrogate , and they were not in a mood to tolerate any trifling with their affections . Grinning for the cameras , comforted by the murmuring of the true believers in the back row , delighting in the wonder of his own virtue , Perot said , " I urge you , on behalf of millions of ordinary people who are out there earning a living : Stand on principle . Do n't compromise . You will have their support . I can guarantee you . I can deliver if I have to . " What was shocking about the remark was the servile acquiescence with which it was received . Nobody laughed in the man 's face . Perot had dressed up the nakedness of his own ambition in the Halloween costume of the public-opinion polls , and he might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Caesar 's legions , or the terrible wrath of Ramtha , the ancient warrior from the lost continent of Atlantis who speaks to Shirley MacLaine , but nobody asked him why he was n't wearing his Batman mask or his wizard 's pointed hat . The politicians lacked the courage to laugh because , like President Clinton and the oracles of the Washington news media , they accepted the existence of what they called " the Perot vote " as if it were as real as Mexico and as lucky as a winning lottery ticket . If Perot could attract 18 million votes in last year 's presidential election without bothering to declare himself a candidate , and if , four months later , his approval ratings stood at 51 percent ( as opposed to 24 percent in September 1992 ) , then clearly his voice was the voice of God . The polls were the polls , and what was the use of objection or dissent to people frightened of both the future and the electorate ? Senator William S. Cohen ( R. , Me. ) expressed the presiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perot 's contempt , with a flatterer 's eager smile : " I walked in here from a meeting with the President , and there were as many people waiting to get in to see you as there had been waiting to see him . And I said , " Who won the election ? ' ' " The question took the measure of the fear and trembling on Capitol Hill . During Perot 's guest appearances before various committees , most of the politicians offered him easy cues in the manner of Larry or Charlie or Jay . The two politicians brave enough to ask rude questions  --  Representative Donald M. Payne ( D. , N.J. ) and Senator Harry M. Reid ( D. , Nev. )  --  noticed that Perot drew his strength from the general loss of faith in the institutions of democratic government . The question , Payne said , is not " Whom does he help ? " but rather " Whom does he hurt ? " Reid said , " I 've come to realize that people are afraid of Ross Perot . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Perot vote represents no interest and no constituency . Like the Bermuda Triangle or the Land of Mordor , it is a fiction , an anthology of grievance or a reservoir of unspecific anger and resentment . Last November it mostly consisted of the disillusion with the purpose as well as the practice of politics , and as President Clinton continues to disavow his campaign promises ( bowing or curtsying to almost any corporate lobbyist dressed in a loud voice and an expensive suit ) , it manifests itself as an inchoate feeling of nostalgia for a world of kings and queens and fairy tales . During the last six months , I 've listened to as many as forty people declare their belief in H. Ross Perot , but aside from their aversion to Bill Clinton and perhaps higher taxes , I ca n't imagine their agreeing with one another on any specific political theory , program , policy , issue , philosophy , plan , or initiative . Unlike the people who comprised the vote for Governor George Wallace in 1972 , or the supporters of Theodore Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappiness . Democracy is about consenting to lose an election , about the balancing of particular interests and the making of always imperfect compromises between specific constituencies , but Perot 's admirers think democracy is a movie by Frank Capra . Among their disparate company I 've counted automobile salesmen , environmentalists , English professors , social engineers , monopolists , remittance men , and friends of Ralph Nader . What they hold in common is an agenda of miscellaneous complaint . Everyone knows what he or she detests ( most especially media spokespersons wearing dark suits and red ties ) , but hardly anyone knows how a caucus works or who paves the roads . On a Friday afternoon in April , over the course of two hours on a train , I met a young woman who said that she voted for Perot because President Clinton had betrayed Kirtland 's warbler as well as the spotted owl , and an older man , retired and living in Naples , Florida , who said that he had reduced his interests to three  --  the Bible , the Social Register , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City in early May , I ran across an angry gentleman in a tweed suit who jammed a forefinger into my chest while making repeated and emphatic points about Perot 's strength , Perot 's decisiveness , Perot 's resolve , Perot 's grit . Yes , he said , he had considered all the weak-kneed objections , but he was sick of politics , sick of feeling sorry for people who , when you really thought about it , got what they deserved . He did n't think it necessary to specify the tasks to which Perot 's grit might be applied , but I was left with the impression that he would n't think it amiss if Perot began the work of reclamation by placing the members of Congress under house arrest or stringing them up by their thumbs . What was wanted was some strong authoritarian medicine to purge the country of its moral relativism ( or its limousines , or its liberal media , or its grasping real-estate developers ) , and Perot clearly was the man to write the prescription . I suspect that Perot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperament is apparently that of a vindictive prig , a man who would prefer to conduct the affairs of government as if he were the abbot of a monastery or the warden of a prison . With surprisingly few exceptions , all of his associates  --  former , current , commercial , and political  --  testify to his autocratic cast of mind . One is either for him or against him , and anybody who is against him is either a fool or a knave . Certainly he does n't respond well to even the mildest criticism , and he engages in nominally democratic debate only when he has been assured the privilege of the last word . His pose as the country 's candid friend  --  the honest man speaking truth to power  --  is so patently false that I 'm surprised it does n't turn rancid in the heat of the television lights . Perot is more accurately described , in G. K. Chesterton 's phrase , as the " uncandid candid friend , " the smiling and unctuous man who says , " I 'm sorry to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He does n't love what he chastises . The love of country follows from the love of its freedoms , not from the pride in its armies or its gross domestic product . Perot loves his own picture of America , and like the latter-day Puritans who take it upon themselves to examine the citizenry for flaws in its blood , its urine , and its speech , he makes no secret of his sanctimony and intolerance , of his wish to blame , punish , and cast what he trusts will be the first of many stones . The rising of Perot 's image over the horizon of the news suggests that the traditional American political narrative has lost much of its force and most of its coherence . None of the contradictions in Perot 's character  --  the avowed autocrat championing the cause of populist revolt , the humble and plain-spoken servant of the people asking , in effect , to be elected king-dissuades his admirers from the belief that he embodies the country 's only hope of regeneration . Perot picked up the scent of Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his budget message to Perot 's approval before presenting it to Congress . In March Lloyd Bentsen , the secretary of the treasury , made a pilgrimage to Dallas to ask Perot 's blessing for the President 's crusade against the deficit . Perot ignored the flattery and sharpened the edge of his sarcasm . Within a month of the inauguration he had returned to the talk shows , and to one of the television reporters in attendance he said , " My role is as a grain of sand to the oyster . " He canvassed the country as the bringer of bad news , speaking to rapt audiences in California , Texas , Colorado , Florida , Maine , testifying before Congress , presenting two half-hour advertisements for himself on NBC ( at a price of $500,000 each ) , and in answer to questions about the business of state , he relied on his gift for the caustic phrase : On the North American Free Trade Agreement  --  " A worn-out inner tube . " Of the Clinton Administration 's attempt to stimulate the economy  --  " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure cancer with aspirin . " Of the United States Congress  --  " It 's time to pick up a shovel and clean out the barn . " Of the White House advisers assigned to formulate an energy policy  --  " Poets , philosophers , and beekeepers . " Of the secrecy protecting Hillary Clinton 's deliberations about health care  --  " This is not a nuclear bomb program . " The witticisms achieved their intended effect , and as the winter passed into spring , President Clinton worried as much about the Perot vote  --  its demography , average age , racial composition , throw weight , and mystical significance  --  as he worried about his budget proposals and the war in Bosnia . In early April , speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors at Annapolis , in a tone of voice that was nearly that of a hurt and puzzled child , he was saying that 85 percent of his economic program was " what Ross Perot recommended in the campaign . " Clinton did n't know how to placate or appease Perot , and his nervousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a toadying courtier , and the impression hastened his descent in the public esteem . By early May Clinton and Perot were exchanging insults in the newspapers ( referring to each other as liars and rumormongers ) , and it had become embarrassingly clear that the gentlemen resembled rival talk-show hosts competing for the same audience . To the extent that authority is invested in persons instead of ideas or institutions , the politician stands on no platform other than the scaffolding of self-dramatization . The rule of love supplants the rule of law , and instead of addressing fellow citizens , the commoner who would be king seeks to recruit fans . If the media had wished to do so , they could have discredited Perot and the Perot vote as easily as they did the Branch Davidians or Oliver Stone . The man quite clearly did n't know as much about the practice of democratic government as the average tenth-grade student in a second-rate public school in downtown Waco . The book that he published during the 1992 presidential campaign appeared on the best-seller list only because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as was necessary to answer the alarms of the newspaper headlines . If he 'd not been worth $2.5 billion , he would have been seen as another salesman of economic self-help touring the circuit of the talk shows in order to hustle his theories of financial redemption ( $21.95 in hard cover ; $9.95 in paperback ; $27.50 for the videocassette ) , and his political views would have been understood for what they were  --  the commonplace axioms of a pretentious businessman prompted to play the part of statesman and sage . But the news media , like Perot , adopted the pose of the uncandid candid friend , and they preferred the melodrama of the wealthy scoutmaster at odds with the wayward son of the South . Perot as clown did n't sell papers , but Perot as Sir Lancelot sold in the markets of superstition to the same sort of people who read Rush Limbaugh and Women Who Run with the Wolves . The loss of distinction between who is real and what is fictitious sustains the market for movies on the order of Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books in the manner of E. L. Doctorow 's Ragtime , for the art of lip sync and the New Age dreams of a shaman 's return from Atlantis . Perot commissions Ken Follett to write a heroic version of his life under the title On Wings of Eagles , and Gloria Steinem , always a bellwether of the going trend , aligns the passion for witchcraft with feminist political doctrine : " The healers and wise women of pagan times knew what they were doing when they made covens of thirteen witches  --  small enough so everyone could talk , large enough for diversity and an uneven number so decisions were not deadlocked . " The transformation of politics into soap opera makes nonsense of the sham distinctions between Democrat and Republican , liberal and conservative . Our political discourse becomes synonymous with advertising  --  a mob of images notable for the strict separation of cause and effect  --  and the inferior forms of credulity , on a par with astrology and fortune-telling , comprise the tailor 's remnants of what was once a public debate . The less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent their desire to appoint politicians to the ranks of the immortals . The founders of the American republic entertained few illusions about the perfection of human nature , but as an advance over the pagan belief in a pantheon of gods and heroes , they proposed the countervailing ideal of a civil government conducted by mere mortals . The proposition was as courageous as it was optimistic , but it does n't meet the expectations of an age that worships celebrity and defines itself as the sum of its fears . As the world comes to be seen as a more dangerous and complicated place than was dreamed of in the philosophy of Walt Disney , people become impatient with rulers in whom they all too easily can recognize weaknesses embarrassingly similar to their own . The news broadcasts swell with proofs of catastrophe  --  murder in the suburbs and riots in the cities , civil war in Bosnia and bankruptcy in Washington  --  and an anxious public yearns for the shows of omnipotence , not only on the part of its presidents but also from its scientists , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen . Because omnipotence does n't exist in the state of nature , it must be manufactured , and the supply increases with the demand . The bestseller lists promise the miracles of rescue and deliverance ( in the form of diets , exercise machines , and manuals of spiritual recovery ) , and on the stage of the national political theater the cast of democratic magistrates gives way to a procession of miraculous mandarins offering prayers and sacrifices to the sun or the moon or the deficit . Some of them sing and dance , and some of them , like H. Ross Perot , draw diagrams and astonish Jay Leno with the great news that they also play drums . <p>
