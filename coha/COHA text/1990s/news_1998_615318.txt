<p> It could be a family album  --  or the wall of a mausoleum . Instead of patches , the quilt draped over a blackboard at the Link Counseling Center in Sandy Springs bears pictures of people who look to be enjoying life . A young man swinging a golf club . A woman in a lab coat with a clipboard . A boy in a tuxedo at his brother 's wedding . A father cradling his infant child . Each image is accompanied by a set of years  --  a birth year , a death year  --  and the queasy knowledge that these people , however happy they appear freeze-framed on this field of brown fabric , took their own lives . <p> " They look so normal , " says Sandy Martin , an Atlanta real estate agent , who conceived the Faces of Suicide quilt . " That 's the point . It can happen to anyone . " <p> It happened to her . Her son Tony shot himself . He 's on the right side of the quilt , the grinning young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years ago , the last thing a suicide victim 's family would have wanted was to publicly discuss their private tragedy . Suicide , the eighth-leading cause of death in the United States , was a source of shame , guilt and religious condemnation . But now the death that dare not speak its name is finally being spoken about . A grass-roots suicide awareness movement is trying to dispel the stigma and ignorance associated with self-inflicted death as it lobbies the government to do more to attack suicide as a preventable public health problem . Much of the movement is growing out of Atlanta , through the anguished efforts of loved ones left behind struggling to find purpose in their pain . <p> Jerry and Elsie Weyrauch , whose daughter Terri hanged herself , run a suicide prevention network called SPAN out of the basement of their Cobb County home . Last year , they successfully petitioned the U.S. Senate to declare suicide prevention a national priority . This month , they 've organized an unprecedented conference of experts and activists  --  co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a national program to reduce suicide . <p> Iris Bolton , whose son Mitch shot himself , turned her tragedy into a life 's calling . She founded one of America 's first suicide support groups and , as director of the Link , has counseled the families of victims for almost 20 years . Her counseling center is about to break ground on a new library and national referral service on suicide next to the existing facility in Sandy Springs . <p> Kenya Napper Bello , whose husband , Razak , jumped to his death in an Atlanta hotel atrium , publishes a newsletter called Black Men Do n't Commit Suicide and has become a nationally known speaker on the growing problem of suicide among African-Americans . <p> And then there 's Martin , the woman who came up with the idea of creating suicide memorial quilts like those for AIDS casualties . Since beginning her first quilt last year  --  " The people at Kinko 's were crying when I told them what the picture transfers were for "  --  she has taken her gesture of remembrance across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of the U.S. Capitol last spring during a suicide awareness rally . <p> That day , standing before the brightly colored array of lost lives , Surgeon General David Satcher pronounced suicide a " serious public health problem " and conceded that it had not been addressed adequately . In doing so , he made official an evolution in attitude and public policy that would have seemed unthinkable when he was growing up in Alabama 50 years ago . By their own hand <p> The numbers are sobering . More Americans die of suicide than AIDS or homicide . In preliminary figures for 1997 , the National Center for Health Statistics reports 29,725 suicides in the United States  --  more than three for every two murders  --  and that may be understating it . Researchers believe suicide is underreported by as much as 20 percent . <p> It is largely a male tragedy . Men are four times as likely to kill themselves as women ( although women are thought to try at least as often ) . Both sexes attempt it for a variety of mental , physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impulsive , lonely , poor , frustrated . In 60 percent of the cases , they are depressed to the point of hopelessness and impaired by what psychologists describe as a tunnel vision that limits them to seeing only one way out of their pain when there may be many . <p> For centuries , society blamed suicide victims for their despair . The church considered it a mortal sin and would not allow suicides to be buried in hallowed ground . In his epic verse tour of hell , Dante reflected this view by casting suicide victims into the seventh ring of damnation , one step closer to Satan than murderers . Suicide was a crime in many countries . In England during the 1860s , a man who had attempted to kill himself by slitting his throat was arrested , his wounds stitched up , then hanged for his offense . <p> " We used to see suicide as a character flaw , " says Robert Gebbia , director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , a New York-based research organization . " Now we 're more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , something more like diabetes . I think a lot of that has to do with survivors coming forward to talk about it . " <p> But as survivors know so well , suicide still unnerves people more than most other deaths , even if the moral taint has faded . Survivors talk of the condolence cards that never came , the casseroles never brought , the words never spoken because people are afraid of saying the wrong thing at such an awkward moment . <p> After his son committed suicide , Wayne Rogers , a Delta Air Lines scheduler in Douglasville , actually found himself comforting people who were trying to comfort him . " You could see it in their eyes ; they had no idea what to say . So I 'd put my hands on their shoulders and tell them it was all right . " <p> Suicide is a particularly thorny subject for African-Americans . " It 's definitely more taboo with black people , " says Tonji Durant , a CDC epidemiolgist who co-wrote a well-publicized study this year showing that the suicide rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napper Bello , a 33-year-old mental health advocate in Atlanta , has lived that study . Four years ago , her young husband lost his job and his struggle with manic depression , leaping to his death from the 32nd floor of the Marriott Marquis hotel . In her grief , she could see a pattern she had never discerned before ; she personally knew seven young black men , not counting her husband , who had killed themselves . One of them had been president of her class at Benjamin E. Mays High School . <p> " I got angry that we were n't doing anything , " she says . " A lot of black people do n't talk about it when they have problems . A lot of them do n't trust anyone outside the church . They see hospitals and psychiatrists as white institutions . " <p> Bello started speaking at churches and schools . She wrote about her husband in Essence magazine and received 700 letters . She started a newsletter with the ironic name Black Men Do n't Commit Suicide . One time , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exclaimed , " Suicide ? That 's what crazy white people do . " <p> Bello knew better , of course . Her journey to understanding began when she went to a national meeting of survivors , as the friends and families of suicides call themselves . It was there that she first heard the woman who is regarded as the godmother of the suicide awareness movement in Atlanta . A place to be heard <p> On Mount Vernon Highway , two blocks from the hurly-burly of Roswell Road , a rambling gray house sits in a grove of trees like an island of serenity . Taking in the muted colors and hushed voices inside , it 's easy to forget that people come here to pour out their hearts , to cry and wail if need be . For them , this place is a sedative . And the administering nurse is a dark-haired woman of 67 with a perpetual smile and a bottomless box of Kleenex who knows from experience how endless the valley can be . <p> Iris Bolton was already director of the Link when suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then was drug abuse and family counseling , and the mother of four had gone back to school to earn her counseling degree at Georgia State University . One night that February , she came home to find neighbors loading a bloody mattress into a truck in her carport . Mitch , her 20-year-old , had shot himself with two revolvers while he was on the phone with a girlfriend . She believes he suffered from undiagnosed depression . <p> Bolton plunged into a depression herself . She could n't sleep or eat . She dropped out of college and stopped coming to the office . <p> " I thought I was a failure as a mother and a failure in my career , " she says . " I could n't imagine why anyone would listen to a counselor who could n't save her own son . " The thought makes her chuckle slightly . " We get such grandiose ideas after a suicide . We think we caused it , so we have this exaggerated sense of responsibility . " <p> Three months later , a minister friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group for bereaved parents . " Go away , " she told him , " I do n't even know if I want to live yet . " Three months later , the minister called again , and she reluctantly agreed to help organize a session that evolved into one of the country 's first suicide support groups . There are 12 such chapters meeting regularly in metro Atlanta now , more than 300 nationwide , most of them going by the name Survivors of Suicide . Twenty years ago , there were none . <p> " It was a collective outpouring from all over the country , " Bolton says . <p> The suburban mom made suicide counseling her mission . She enrolled at Emory University and earned a degree in suicidology ( the catch-all term used to describe suicide experts , regardless of discipline ) . She spoke at schools after teenagers had taken their lives and organized an aftercare team to make house calls to counsel families in shock . She wrote a book about her child and her grief , a slender , heart-rending volume called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember the agent saying that no New York publisher would want to buy a book about suicide , " Bolton says . So she published it herself in 1983 and has distributed more than 40,000 copies . The agent probably would n't make such a comment now that Danielle Steel , Judy Collins and other prominent people have written memoirs about their children 's suicides . <p> Bolton 's style of confessional healing is n't for everyone . She finds that when families of suicide victims come to the Link for support group sessions or individual counseling , women usually keep coming while men often drop out . Men tend to view suicide as an inexcusable sign of weakness . They do n't like to talk about it , and that 's her first rule of dealing with suicide : Talk about it . Tell the story . Stop denying . Express your emotions . Forgive the dead , forgive yourself . Find some meaning in the misfortune . <p> No one has taken her advice to heart more than a retired couple in Marietta . From shock to activism <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of their first visitors was Bolton . They did n't know her from Eve . She went to their house at a friend 's suggestion and stayed for five hours . " Iris gave us permission to talk about it , " Elsie Weyrauch says . " I do n't think we would have made it without her . " <p> That was 11 years ago . Today the Weyrauchs are preparing for a landmark meeting of the nation 's top suicide experts and activists , the National Suicide Prevention Conference Oct. 15-18 in Reno , Nevada . It would not be happening without them . Permission to talk , indeed . <p> The Weyrauchs knew that Terri , the oldest of their four children , was introspective and sensitive , but they had no idea she suffered from suicidal depression . Apparently , she did n't like to take her medication because she felt it interfered with her job . She was a physician , married and working in Chicago . One morning in June 1987 , she exercised and dressed to go to work , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in a closet . <p> Her parents knew little more about suicide than the person who , not thinking , sent them a condolence card showing a raccoon suspended from a tree with the caption " Hang in there . " <p> " I had been a psychiatric nurse in my younger days and had even worked suicide watches , and I knew nothing , " Elsie says . " I was as judgmental as anybody . I thought suicides only happened in dysfunctional families , so naturally I blamed myself . " <p> The Weyrauchs set about educating themselves . They became involved in the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and helped form a Southeastern chapter . They began meeting with the CDC 's National Center for Violence Prevention and Control , which had begun investigating suicide as a public health issue . They talked to politicians , professors , ministers , survivors , think tanks , pharmaceutical companies  --  anyone who might hold a piece of the puzzle . <p> " It seemed to me that we had all these groups doing work , but no one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the energetic retired Navy quartermaster had an idea : He and his wife would found an organization to link survivors with experts and authorities in an attempt to build support for a concerted national effort to reduce suicide . <p> Since then , SPAN ( the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network ) has sponsored three suicide memorial vigils at the U.S. Capitol and delivered 72,000 letters to lawmakers in support of a resolution declaring suicide a national priority . The Senate passed it unanimously last year ; it 's pending in the House , where Georgia Congressman John Lewis introduced it and Speaker Newt Gingrich has signed on as a co-sponsor . The resolution is just that  --  a resolution with no plan or funding  --  but the Weyrauchs see it as an important first step in building public awareness . <p> " Even though it 's largely symbolic , there is value in the resolution , " agrees Alan Berman , director of the American Association of Suicidology , a research and professional group based in Washington . " Jerry and Elsie are vocal and emotionally involved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity than anyone . Clinicians and researchers do n't know how to do that . " <p> In the meantime , the Weyrauchs continue to work seven days and 100 hours a week on the sorrowful subject that they admit has become an obsession . In their cluttered basement , the phone is always ringing , the keyboards are always clacking , and their dead daughter is always watching from her pictures on the walls . <p> " We 've got so much work left to do , " Elsie says . She was reminded of that at a fund-raising run recently . When one of the police officers on duty saw what the cause was , he complained , " We get so many suicide calls . I wish those people would just kill themselves if that 's what they want . " Another suicide , another survivor <p> Every day , on average , another 85 Americans take their lives . Each death is like a rock cast into a pond , spreading waves of grief through an ever-widening circle of survivors . There are an estimated 4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a family member commit suicide . On June 6 , 1996 , Mary Ann Stark became one of them . <p> As she settles into the living room of her Roswell home to Tell the Story , the 49-year-old widow realizes there are n't any photos of her husband in view . " We do n't have many , " she says quietly . " Norman always took the pictures . " <p> The sofa and chairs have been re-upholstered so they do n't remind her of that day , four summers ago , when her husband of 25 years sat here and told her that he had lost his job . <p> Norman Stark was an marketing executive for a well-known Atlanta company  --  his wife asks that the name not be used  --  and had worked there for 22 years . One day , without warning , he was called into an office and informed that he was being let go in a reorganization . <p> " His work was his life and hobby , " Mary Ann says . " He loved that company like a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> For months he tried to find work with another large company . Consulting did n't appeal to him ; he wanted to belong to another family . But he was in his mid-40s , and the offers did n't come . <p> " I could tell he was getting depressed , " Mary Ann says . " He started withdrawing . He would n't play golf with his friends . He would n't eat dinner with me and Tracy ( their daughter ) ; he 'd take it downstairs and eat by himself . And he did n't want to talk about it with anyone . " <p> Early on , her husband visited a couple of psychiatrists recommended by his former employer 's health plan . One of them said there was nothing wrong with him , he just needed a job . After Norman started losing weight and not dressing himself everyday , Mary Ann made an appointment for him to see another doctor in the hopes that he would prescribe antidepressant medication . <p> On the day before he was supposed to go , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her horror that he had been writing a will . A minute later . she heard a noise like a door slamming . Norman had walked into the back yard , laid out a blanket so he would n't make a mess , and killed himself with a shotgun . The meaning she makes <p> It is two years later , a Tuesday night in September , and Mary Ann is attending her Survivors of Suicide meeting at the Link . The chairs are circled , the tissue paper is handy , and the soulmates in grief are updating each other on their ongoing struggles . <p> " I have an announcement , " Mary Ann tells the group . " I have decided to go back to school and get a degree in counseling . " She wants to work with companies to persuade them that they can do a better job with the mental health of their employees . " That 's the meaning I 've made out of this , " she says . " No one should have to go through what I 've been through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hard not to look beyond them , to the blackboard , where the freeze-framed smiles of the dead are captured on the quilt .
