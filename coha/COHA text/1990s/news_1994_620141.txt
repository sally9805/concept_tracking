<p> DEATH AND TERROR IN SAN FRANCISCO <p> Editor  --  Living in the 1600 block of Franklin Street and for 25 minutes on Sunday night , November 13 , I watched , in terror , the bravery of our S.F.P.D. trying to overcome a madman shooting up our neighborhood . Each day I go to work never giving my safety much thought , but peering out of a window Sunday night and looking down at these brave men and women has given me a renewed appreciation for what they are asked to do on a daily basis . My thanks to the brave men and women of the S.F.P.D. who , daily , put their lives on the line . Most of us take the police for granted or say they are n't doing enough to fight crime . After what I witnessed on Sunday night , this is so far from the truth . <p> There are many of us who wish guns could not be sold so easily or get into the hands of those who do n't care about or respect anyone , anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police helpless against the firepower of one person and knowing the fear of my neighbors on Franklin and Pine streets , all of whom were imprisoned for 25 minutes because of this madman , I know something needs to be done about guns . I 'm one of the little guys who feels powerless against the power of guns . I 'm one of the little guys who thought this could n't happen in my neighborhood . Gun lobbyists do n't know the fear we little guys felt on Sunday night . <p> Our police need our help , and stopping the sale of war guns is something that must happen . How many more people need to die for a principle ? To all gun lobbyists  --  when a gunman gone mad is shooting up your neighborhood , call me and remind me of your " right to bear arms . " <p> KATHRYN MURRAY <p> San Francisco <p> UNJUSTIFIED BEATING <p> Editor  --  The San Francisco police take into custody Robert Pinckney , an unarmed man who has been badly wounded by gunshots in the arm and leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a suspect . <p> Even if he was a suspect , this does not justify the police beating a helpless person . Perhaps they are unaware of the Rodney King incident ! The assaulting police officers should be fired or severely disciplined . The S.F. Police Department should not tolerate brutal cops . <p> The fact that this victim of police brutality was a hero who may have saved police or civilians from death or injury only dramatizes the outrageousness of the police conduct . <p> DAVID WEITZMAN <p> Berkeley <p> END OF THE ' FREE LUNCH ' <p> Editor  --  Your November 16 editorial , " Newt 's Contract Offers a Free Lunch , " sounded like it was written by Clinton 's budget chief Alice Rivlin . The editorial 's very title reeks of liberal hypocrisy . Indeed , it was the 40-year Democrat-controlled " free- lunch " Congress that gave us soaring deficits and a " free- lunch " agenda of welfare . The Republicans are going to really address these " free-lunch " issues , and now is not the time for your paper to belittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 . <p> As for Reagan 's fiscal policies , they were not really implemented during the 1980s because the Democrat Congress refused to control its knee-jerk spending . The question now is whether Clinton will agree to work with Congress , or use his veto power to cause gridlock . And if gridlock results , the American people will rightly place the blame on Clinton 's vetoes . <p> Incidentally , another article in your November 16 issue entitled , " GOP Tax Cuts Could Revive Inflation , White House Says , " centered on a partisan attack levelled by Alice Rivlin against the " Contract with America " that the GOP tax cuts might cause a recession . It seems that your editorial writers get their ideas directly from the White House , and unashamedly print their liberal sources alongside them . <p> DONALD PADGETT <p> Pacific Grove ( Monterey County ) <p> ' WAS N'T IT . . . ? <p> Editor  --  How refreshing it was to read The Chronicle 's stinging rebuke of Newt Gingrich 's promised " Voodoo Two " economic package ( Editorial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Chronicle that twice endorsed the man who brought us " Voodoo I , " along with its multitrillion-dollar deficits and the legacy of misery to so many Americans who are not millionaires ? <p> And was n't it The Chronicle that recently endorsed Pete Wilson , whose fiscal policy for a bankrupt state can be summarized as , " Cut Taxes , Build Prisons " ? <p> No , my memory must be failing me . I 've been watching so much television lately , and will watch more to avoid the reality that is about to befall us . <p> GRAY BRECHIN <p> Berkeley <p> A CHAIRMAN RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  I regret that a November 16 Chronicle article , in describing my chairmanship of the Committee on Natural Resources , alleged that I ran " roughshod over those who did not share his views . " Your reporter neglected to mention that , unlike many chairmen , I allow all amendments and bills to be offered before the committee , and when those bills come before the full House , I always support the ability of any member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am often praised by senior Re publicans for my commitment to an open legislative process , even when such openness resulted in 30 hours of obstructionist debate during consideration of the California desert bill earlier this year . <p> Your reporter should not be fooled by those who disguise their opposition to environmental policy by complaining about the democratic process . If an amendment fails , it is not because of my management of the committee , but because an insufficient number of members supported it . That 's democracy . <p> GEORGE MILLER , chairman <p> Committee on Natural Resources <p> House of Representatives <p> Washington , D.C. <p> BALLOT ADVICE <p> Editor  --  Absentee ballots should be upgraded to include the voter 's thumbprint and Social Security number printed with magnetic ink on the ballot . The high-speed optical scanners available today could process 500,000 ballots in a matter of hours . It 's as simple as that ! <p> CYRUS WEISS <p> San Francisco <p> ARTISTIC VISION <p> Editor  --  A main problem with today 's government is that there are few responsible artists that hold office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take . I do n't mean we should put the ever present science and modern technology in the closet . It should be part of the country 's vision , but art , heroic sentiments , should be in the forefront . <p> TED TRISH <p> Walnut Creek <p> THE NAME 'S THE THING <p> Editor  --  Politics are at best complicated and unpredictable . A popular race-track strategy may be in order : when in doubt , the name is the thing . <p> For governors , Jim Guy defeated Sheffield . Fob won in Alabama , no California-think that he is fresh off the boat . Zell won , just up the road . So did Angus and Arne . A guy called Fife orchestrated Eddie Basha 's defeat . Only Providence could help one in Rhode Island ; Myrth York vs . Lincoln Almond . In the Senate , voters chose Connie , Olympia , Spencer , Trent , Orrin , and Slade ; all good people perhaps not , but good names for the country . <p> Not there are Ollie , Harris , Mitt and Parris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day comes too for this election 's theme  --  a guy losing to Montana 's Conrad , the Honorable Jack Mudd . <p> JOHN COAKLEY <p> Napa <p> WELCOME BACK <p> Editor  --  Thank the journalistic heavens the strike is kaput . Christmas came early , Herb Caen is back . His column is our literary dialysis and I was getting white . <p> There is a reason Herb Caen 's column is located in the middle of The Chronicle . He 's not found in the front , nor lodged in the rear . Caen is in the middle , padded each direction by layers of paper which act like bones , muscle and skin . Yes , his column lies protected as do all hearts . <p> Welcome back . <p> ROBERT WARD <p> Santa Cruz
