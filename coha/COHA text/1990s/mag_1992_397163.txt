The world has lost the war against AIDS . The following statistics makes this readily apparent : * There is one new HIV infection in the U.S. every 54 seconds . * There are 267 new cases of AIDS every day , about 8,000 each month . * There is one AIDS death every nine minutes . * At least four in every 1,000 college students now are infected . When I first started hearing about and fighting against what was to be called AIDS , there were only 41 cases . When I first started getting really scared and vocal , there were 1,000 . America rapidly is approaching 200,000 cases of full-blown AIDS , with up to 10,000,000 people infected with the HIV virus worldwide . No one knows how many there really are , and no one even knows how to count them . Currently , the group contracting AIDS the fastest in the major cities is heterosexual women . In New York City , the percentage of straight women coming down with AIDS has risen from three to seven percent . The first 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish accruing in only two years . ( If the U.S. health care system nearly collapsed under the burden of the first 100,000 cases , imagine what another 100,000 will do . ) The worst thing about these numbers is that they 're terribly low . The Centers for Disease Control , which keeps the tallies , relies on doctors reporting all their cases . We 're discovering many doctors , for various reasons , are n't doing so . They have n't time , or they 're protecting their practices or their patients . Thus , all of these figures , which are known to be low , are also known to be imprecise . They 're extrapolations based on small samplings from isolated areas or from those cases that are reported to authorities . We also know that large numbers of those infected never see a doctor . By the year 2000 , the World Health Organization estimates that , globally , there will be 40,000,000 people infected with the AIDS virus . One out of four U.S. households already has been touched by AIDS . AIDS , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people knew from the very beginning what would occur unless measures of warning and education were taken immediately . However , because AIDS then was striking down mostly gay men , the forces of bigotry were powerful enough to prevent such measures from being taken . Indeed , ignorance and intolerance still are doing so . AIDS has taught 25,000,000 gay sons and daughters a frightening lesson . Many of their parents do n't want to take care of them when they become ill . In fact , this country will do almost anything rather than pay attention to AIDS : It will not educate or support adequate funding for research and treatment ; do anything to lessen the cost of what meager treatments do exist , which are so expensive that most people with AIDS simply ca n't afford them ; or exert pressure on the second president in a row who pretends that AIDS  --  more than a decade into a plague  --  is n't even here and refuses to put someone with brains in charge . Can you imagine : A plague is raging and no one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing their own kids ; in a time of plague , only minimal , sporadic , uncoordinated research is being conducted by mostly second-raters or , for the most part , not even being undertaken at all ; lifesaving drugs ( some even owned by the government ) are priced so high that most people who desperately need them ca n't afford them ; no endorsement of full-scale education , safe sex guidelines , or condoms ; the second consecutive compassionless U.S. president refuses to put anyone in charge ( as he did immediately for scandals involving HUD and the savings and loan industry ) ? George Bush has appointed another in a long line of useless Secretaries of Health and Human Services and a compliant Surgeon General ( getting rid of C. Everett Koop , who was an exceptionally useful one ) , and removed the head of the Food and Drug Administration just when , miracle of miracles , the man was beginning to do something effective . Until recently , Bush had n't even appointed a director for the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a government-supervised network of local hospital treatment centers , which has not worked , functioned , or gotten off the ground . God forbid they should test anything but AZT , which has produced a 50% increase in lymphomas among those patients who manage to survive it . God forbid they should run studies on any of the 50-100 drugs backed up in the NIH pipeline or on a combination of therapies , test treatments for the opportunistic infections that kill most AIDS patients , or acknowledge any treatment from abroad . God forbid they should test drugs not manufactured by the companies that have nearly every principal investigator at every hospital , university , medical center , and government agency on their payrolls as " consultants . " ( Talk about conflict of interest ! Just about every AIDS investigator receives fees from one or more pharmaceutical manufacturer . ) We hardly are closer to a cure than we were six years ago when this system was set up to research and locate the cure for AIDS . As matters now stand , 40,000,000 people are going to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has said publicly that he believes it can be cured . Yet , every impediment imaginable is being placed in the way of patients receiving this cure . This is happening because AIDS still is thought of as a gay disease . Even though AIDS affects predominantly heterosexual people in Africa and infection rates among straight cases in the U.S. continue to rise slowly , it has served the conservative right-wing agenda in America to maintain that AIDS is a gay disease . Faggots are this era 's kikes and niggers . An officially sanctioned scapegoat to sow hatred seems , historically , always to be necessary in this country and this world . As it 's now illegal to discriminate against Jews and Blacks , let 's go after the queers . Gays also keep Congress inordinately busy . Sen. Gordon Humphrey ( R.-N.H. ) offered amendments two years in a row denying Federal health care funds to any organization that used the terms " normal , natural , or healthy " to describe homosexuality . Sen. William Armstrong ( R.-Colo. ) offered a broad amendment to the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove protection for gays whether they had AIDS or not . Sen. Jesse Helms ( R.-N.C. ) got an amendment passed that requires all government-funded safe sex materials in no way to mention , illustrate , or discuss homosexuality or the ways gays have sex . I had a friend in ACT UP ( AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ) from a small town in Massachusetts who was 22 years old and very sick . I asked him : " How did you get infected so young ? Did n't you know what was going on ? Surely word must have reached your town to be careful . " Yet , he told me , he had n't known anything about AIDS when he made love those first few times . When I meet kids like this , on their way to death before they even know life , I want to force people like Ronald Reagan , George Bush , Cardinal O'Connor , former New York Mayor Ed Koch , Jesse Helms , and Abe Rosenthal ( the editor of The New York Times during those first years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News That 's Fit to Print , " refused to write anything about AIDS ) to come face-to-face with these youngsters who are going to die because their leaders refused to allow the country to be educated and warned . There are 25,000,000 gay people in the United States , which is no small number of taxpayers . We have a right to be taken care of when we are ill just like white heterosexual middle-class men , the ruling class in this country . Indeed , the American Revolution was fought over just this issue  --  taxation without representation . So let 's talk about " the rights of taxpayers to determine how their money is spent , " as Rep. Pat Williams ( D.-Mont. ) did , referring to heterosexual taxpayers . Let 's not take any more polls about whether " taxpayers " or editors of Newsweek or viewers of " Entertainment Tonight " approve of gays . It 's illegal to take polls about whether people approve of Jews or blacks . ( If these polls were taken , I think Jews and blacks would lose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gays are abnormal . Twenty-five million is too large a number to be caused by anything but normal statistical differences . Do n't claim , as Rep. William Dannemeyer ( R.-Calif. ) has , that homosexuals can change  --  we ca n't and would n't want to if we could  --  so are n't entitled to their rights . Jews can convert to Christianity , but , either way , they 're protected against discrimination . When a black kid is murdered in Bensonhurst , a Jewish kid gets mauled in Brooklyn , or 14 school kids are killed in upstate New York by a tornado , the law and the media appear in droves . Gays are murdered regularly and usually no one is there at all . HATE AND DISCRIMINATION I seem to have spent a lot of time talking about hate and discrimination , rather than about AIDS , but then it has taken me more than 10 years to realize that AIDS , in every possible is a metaphor for the hatred of the ruling class for the minority . This minority now includes not only gays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who take drugs ; men and women who prefer not to get married ; and women who find themselves selling their bodies for money . Somehow , this mixed salad of people is tossed together and , instead of being heralded ( as this country and its leaders are always so proud of proclaiming ) as part of the big wonderful " melting pot , " the " rainbow coalition , " the " thousand points of light , " or the " gorgeous mosaic " that makes America brave and great and strong and true , they are relegated to that now-hateful category of minority : the expendable ones ; those who intentionally can be left to die . Intentional genocide is going on . Otherwise , so many people would not be left to die . Otherwise , the leader of our country would put somebody in charge of a plague . Quite simply , some bookkeeper has discovered that it is cheaper to let us die than to try to save us , to keep us alive . Numerous Federal studies and Congressional oversight hearings have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One billion dollars is being flushed down the toilet at the National Institutes of Health , where no one is in charge of AIDS and where there are so many committees and committees within committees and peer reviews that it is truly impossible , and unnecessary , for anyone ever to have to make a decision . Can you imagine a system set up so no one has to make a decision ? That is what has happened to government in our country . It 's also how the Holocaust was allowed to happen : Good men and women , who had families to protect and were part of huge bureaucracies , were only following orders from someone higher up . In America , yet another holocaust is going on . Good men and women with families to feed , who are part of huge bureaucracies , keep their jobs by doing  --  or not doing  --  what their superiors instruct them to do or not do . The superior at the top , the President , tells them nothing , so nothing really is being done , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people are coming down with and dying from AIDS . I asked Dr. Anthony Fauci , who is in charge of choosing and testing new AIDS treatments for our government and who has been called " a hero " by Bush , if he has told the President how awful everything is . Fauci said you do not talk to the President that way . This is how Hitler 's henchmen followed his orders . A society that hates gays has allowed them to become this decade 's Jews . Just as Jews were joined in extermination by others who were not Jewish , so gays now are joined by many others who are not gay . Yet , no one condemns this event . Morality and moral norms are not operating . Just as the world sat by while millions of Jews and others were exterminated , so this same world is sitting by as millions of gays and others are murdered . The Secretary of Health and Human Services , Louis Sullivan , actually has opposed the AIDS Research Bill . The Bush Cabinet is much better on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes . Sullivan has been surrounded by a staff of protective right-wingers . Of all places in the Cabinet , the Department of Health and Human Services is one of the most tricky . This is the department that deals with abortion , and Sullivan , very early on , put his foot in his mouth by favoring abortion , then back-tracking . This act terrified the White House and they surrounded him with a staff so conservative , AIDS rarely is spoken of either . Nobody here is really saying : Go out and kill the gays and the blacks , the Hispanics and the junkies , the prostitutes and the illegitimate kids , and the unwed mothers . Yet , that is what they 're implying and what is really happening . We now recognize that Franklin Roosevelt did less to save the millions of European Jews from their deaths during World War II than was realized at that time or for many years afterward . Two distinguished books go into great detail : While Six Million Died , by Arthur D. Morse , and The Abandonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it quite succinctly : " Since Roosevelt was afraid that the Jewish issue was a political liability , he helped to doom European Jewry by inaction even as he proclaimed America as the asylum for the oppressed . " The man in Roosevelt 's government who was responsible for the Jewish " rescue " issue was Breckinridge Long . According to Wyman , Long does not appear to have been " overtly negative to Jews simply because they were Jews . " He does not appear to have been anti-Semitic . What is clear is that his was the desk at which all help , all suggestions , all possibilities to save Jews stopped . Nothing proceeded any further , to any superior , or to Roosevelt . He performed the same services for Roosevelt , sweeping a particularly uncomfortable issue under the rug , that domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer did for Reagan and that White House Chief of Staff John Sununu performed for George Bush . There is no question in anyone in Washington 's mind that Sununu 's mission was pandering to the conservative right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Jewish issue was to Roosevelt . Every glimmer of progress on AIDS  --  in funding , leadership , and responsibility  --  had been dashed in Sununu 's office . A New York Times reporter described George Bush , on Oct. 29 , 1990 , as " a prisoner of his presidential staff and the information and strategy they funnel to him . " Do n't tell me it ca n't happen here . So , what do we do ? Lie down and die ? Many people do . It 's very hard for minorities to organize . They have enough trouble existing in this world as it is . Many of them are very poor . A lot of them do n't speak English . Most of them , in one way or another , are afraid . That 's why it 's so easy to kill off so many of us . That 's why it 's so easy to evict us , or cut our benefits , or eliminate our social programs . Most people are afraid to fight back . Most people do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have power . Yet , the Constitution gave us power . ( It always amazes me when I tell people they have power and they answer : " Power ? Me ? What power ? " ) Their collective voices are power . Names strung together on membership lists are power . Bodies strung together in a line are power . THE NEVER-ENDING FIGHT I know it 's not easy , that it 's harder than ever . The fight against the entrenched by the dispossessed is never-ending and exhausting . I formed ACT UP in 1986 and , since then , we have achieved considerable power . However , many of us are extremely tired . More and more of us are getting sick and dying faster than we replenish our ranks . AIDS is getting worse and worse . I used to think that ACT UP could save the world . If there was an ACT UP in every city and on every college campus , the system would have no choice but to respond . This country was extricated from the war in Vietnam by a grass-roots movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but AIDS is growing faster . There already are more people dead from AIDS than died in Vietnam . My body now is infected with HIV , I am very tired , and my fellow fighters in ACT UP chapters around the world are tired . I fear for the future of 40,000,000 people unless , by some miracle in some laboratory somewhere , a cure is discovered soon . I do n't know what it takes anymore to rouse you to join this fight or to realize that it is the most important fight in the world today . You must put aside or combine this with other fights which , perhaps , appeal to you more  --  fights for civil rights and equal opportunity , pro-choice , and anti-smoking . Whatever is important to you , I ask you to fight for that and AIDS . A transmissible virus is going around , and nothing is stopping it . While you have been reading this article , about 60 people have become infected and five have died . Only an all-out effort by the President and Federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They alone have the resources and authority to win . Pres. Bush must put one person in charge of AIDS and grant this person emergency powers to cut through the red tape . AIDS must be made top priority . Anything less will condemn 40,000,000 people to death . As matters now stand , I believe nothing , at present or in the near future , is going to save the lives of those presently infected . Despite what you read or hear or see or are told , AIDS is not a manageable disease . I do n't see anything that makes me think it is going to be manageable in my lifetime or the lifetime of those already infected . George Bush knows this . Every doctor in every hospital knows this . Will you be as silent as your President ? Will you be his accomplice in this holocaust ? I hope what I have written somehow reaches a part of you and you will join our fight . Mr. Kramer , the founder of ACT UP ( AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ) , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal Heart . " <p>
