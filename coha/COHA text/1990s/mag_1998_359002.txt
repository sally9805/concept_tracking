Corporate diversity programs have nothing on the U.S. national soccer team that takes the field this week in the World Cup finals , La Coupe du Monde , being held in France . There are blacks , whites and Hispanics . One striker is South African , and the sweeper is from Germany . Better to talk to the left fullback in French ; one midfielder is Dutch-born , another is from Uruguay and yet another from Yugoslavia . Throw in some California dudes , a couple of kids from Jersey , a farm-boy goaltender from Washington State and , bless us , a few sons of suburban soccer moms , and you 've got a classic melting-pot , hyphenated-American squad . " I do n't think about Germany as the country I grew up in , but as the team I want to beat , " says Thomas Dooley , 37 , son of an American serviceman and a German mother . Dooley now plays for the red , white and blue . <P> The World Cup , the quadrennial global soccer championship being fought out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all the best and worst of nationalist sentiments , not to mention the most incredible soccer talent on earth . It 's a spectacle that dwarfs the Olympics in national emotion . Nobody gets upset in Italy if the gymnastics team does n't win a medal , but if the beloved Azzuri falters , the players may want to return home wearing disguises . <P> The U.S. team does n't face that kind of pressure yet , but expectations have been rising as soccer 's popularity in America increases . Dooley , an earnest sort , is captain of the best American team ever , as evidenced by its knocking off world champion Brazil 1-0 in a friendly match earlier this year . Foreign-born players like Dooley , who played for the U.S. in the 1994 World Cup , combined with the fast-rising level of home-grown talent have turned the U.S. team from international doormat to contender . " The mix is good for competition within the team , " says Steve Sampson , the first native-born American to coach the team . " We are playing with a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've learned not to over-respect everybody . We no longer play not to lose . We play to win . " <P> Oddly , the U.S. has also benefitted because it produces players who are good enough to play in Europe . Midfield maestro Claudio Reyna , 24 , from Springfield , N.J. , has established himself at Wolfsburg in Germany 's top league , along with teammate Chad Deering , 27 , from Plano , Texas . Starting U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller , 28 , from Lacey , Wash. , minds the nets for England 's Leicester City and is easily one of the world 's top keepers . His backup , Brad Friedel , of Bay Village , Ohio , plays at Liverpool , one of England 's most famous teams . <P> Yet it 's going to take something special for the U.S. to advance to the second round , because the Yanks are playing in one of the toughest of the eight groups in the tourney . In addition to taking on Germany , a three-time world champion , America faces Yugoslavia , an enormously talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Bosnia .
