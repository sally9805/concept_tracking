<p> THE GREAT SONGWRITERS from the glory days of the American musical used to love poking fun at operatic music in their shows . There is an impish example in the 1956 Jule Styne musical " Bells Are Ringing . " A bunch of New York bookies , who front their operation as a classical record mail-order business , describe the " Simple Little System " they use to place their bets through a telephone-answering service . <p> Everything is done in code , explains Sandor , the head bookie , as the song begins with a mock Verdian oompah accompaniment that teases the famous " Anvil Chorus . " The names of composers represent different race tracks : Beethoven is Belmont Park , Puccini is Pimlico , Humperdinck is Hollywood , and so on . In choral refrains that evoke Handel 's " Hallelujah Chorus , " the other bookies lift their arms and shout " Hialeah ! Hialeah ! " <p> As an opera buff who also reveres the heritage of the American musical , I always find such low-brow satire exhilarating . These traditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Styne , or Loesser , or Rodgers and Hart skewered opera in their playful songs , they were declaring their cultural emancipation . <p> The American musical may have evolved out of European operetta , these creators would seem to be saying , " But what we are doing now is an ocean away from imported high culture . Our shows are sassy , clever and plain-spoken . Opera , humph . With all its pumped-up emotions , hooty singers and absurd recitative , who needs it ? " <p> So why have Broadway composers been doing just that : unabashedly aping the most inflated aspects of opera ? In the last 15 years , the bracing American musical show has been increasingly smothered by international megamusicals with schlocky scores , hokey lyrics and ponderously historical books . Composers and lyricists , especially some recent ones , have been abandoning the hallmark of the American musical tradition : the art of mixing words and music in felicitous , skillful and surprising ways . It 's a direction that infuriates those who revere this uniquely American heritage . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interloper Andrew Lloyd Webber , who fashioned pop riffs , soupy melodies , blatant melodrama and scenic extravagance into what the director Harold Prince once called " family opera . " Also responsible are Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil , the continental team who gave us the overblown " Les Miserables . " The Europeans have had an enervating influence on American musical theater . <p> The decreasing hold of high culture on our media-fixated society may also be a factor . For many , the idea of seeing " Don Giovanni " or reading " Les Miserables " sounds a lot better than the reality of sitting through Mozart 's three-hour opera or slogging through Hugo 's 1,000-page novel . The megamusical can provide an epic alternative that requires just sitting back , letting it hit you and stilling all mental activity . <p> Of course , the European opera and American musical traditions do overlap and , in many cases , the differences are hard to pinpoint . Like many operas , lots of musicals are musically complex and rich with ensembles . And like many musicals , lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me , the telling difference is that the music alone can carry the dramatic substance in an opera in a way that is seldom true in a musical . When I was young , I got hooked on the Saturday radio broadcasts from the Metropolitan Opera , even though I had scant awareness of what the operas were about . Yet it somehow did n't matter ; the music was inherently dramatic . <p> Some dismal results of Broadway 's striving for oversized operatic grandeur are currently in evidence in several of the shows rushed into production to qualify for the Tony Awards in June . <p> The most egregious recent example of a Broadway musical aspiring to opera is " Jekyll and Hyde . " The theme of the show  --  there is good and evil in everyone , so look carefully behind the facade  --  is battered into us by Frank Wildhorn 's hyped-up music and Leslie Bricusse 's doggerel lyrics ( " This is the moment , / This is the time , / When the momentum and the moment/ Are in rhyme , " sings Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in a kind of beefy-voiced faux-recitative . Few songs are allowed to be just songs . A melody will start innocuously enough , then segue into the inevitable buildup , with swelling strings and bursting brass . When something ominous is about to happen , crunch-crunch chords start pounding out a four-squared pulse , and clipped motifs in minor modes begin churning away motorically . <p> The idea that the Broadway show is America 's indigenous opera is an old one . Leonard Bernstein touted it constantly . But what he was talking about was borrowing the sophisticated elements of opera , like extended vocal ensembles , and putting an American spin on them . A score like " Jekyll and Hyde " sounds like a campy caricature of opera . <p> Despite Bernstein 's proclamations about the American musical , his shows are steeped in the words-and-music heritage of Broadway  --  even his elaborate score for " Candide , " which can be seen in a frantic revival at the Gershwin Theater . Bernstein 's music actually parodies opera , in a loving but unmistakable way , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that tweaks the " Jewel Song " from Gounod 's " Faust . " Of course , the musical jokes get lost in Mr. Prince 's three-ring-circus staging . And at a circus , nobody pays much attention to the music . So , not surprisingly , Bernstein 's score does n't have a chance . <p> Stephen Sondheim 's " Sweeney Todd " is another show notable for its almost continuous music and complex vocal ensembles . But it too is misperceived as aspiring to opera . It does nothing of the sort . The music is pervasive because Mr. Sondheim is trying to evoke Victorian English melodrama , where the eerie goings-on were almost continually accompanied by musical murmurings in the orchestra pit , or background refrains in the chorus . <p> And even though the late Jonathan Larson 's " Rent " pays homage to " La Boheme " by zapping Puccini 's characters from Paris in the 1830 's to the East Village in the 1990 's , Mr. Larson was not imitating opera musically . This gifted composer and lyricist was striving to combine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grittiness of rock , a difficult merger that he brokered about as well as could be imagined . <p> It is easy to get caught in the legitimate confusion between opera and the musical , and that may be what happened to Maury Yeston , the composer and lyricist of " Titanic . " <p> This Yale-trained composer and theorist won a Tony Award for his strangely intriguing score to " Nine " in 1982 , a year in which his show also won for best musical over Michael Bennett 's " Dreamgirls . " The Tony Award genie must hover over Mr. Yeston , for he scooped up another best-score award in June for " Titanic , " during a lackluster year . <p> In " Titanic , " at the Lunt Fontanne Theater , he has tried to write some fetching songs in the Broadway tradition , but the titanic grandeur of the story prodded him into operatic pomposity . It is frustrating , for there are hints throughout of Mr. Yeston 's gifts , and Jonathan Tunick 's elegant orchestrations ( for which he also won a Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color to Mr. Yeston 's writing . <p> Some of the music has a muted , modal quality , like old English folk ballads . The pastiche numbers are almost always good : the rag music for the deck dance , the sturdy hymn the passengers sing as a Sunday service . But only in one scene does Mr. Yeston 's music really flesh out the characters : an atypically subtle song involving a young engine room stoker who wants to send a message to his girlfriend in England , and a self-effacing radioman who helps him for free . The music is breezy and charming , with " dot dot , dash dash " telegraph code deftly mixed into the radioman 's lyrics . <p> The song given to the character of the young , unwed and pregnant Kate McGowen , who is fleeing Ireland in desperate hope of finding an American husband , begins with wistful beauty . At first , it 's a relief from the incessant energy of the score . But before long , typical excess takes over , with everyone joining in for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show like a mantra . <p> The roster of Broadway creators who still believe in the words-and-music heritage appears to be thinning out . What is the appeal of these lamely operatic megamusicals ? I can only guess . <p> Great opera , like other high culture , audiences are told , is supposed to be stirring and elevating . Yet what if you find opera boring and incomprehensible . A show like " Jekyll and Hyde " provides a mind-massaging alternative . Audiences try hard to experience an uplifting event of intense musical drama . But to do so , my guess is that many people have to leave their critical scruples in the lobby . <p> At a time when even television sitcoms are cynical ( the just-ended " Roseanne " ) , or urbane and edgy ( " Seinfeld " ) , you would think an audience would be howling at pap like " This is the moment ! / Damn all the odds ! / This day , or never , / I 'll sit forever/ With the gods ! , " sung to insipidly melodramatic music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to rescue Broadway for us , things may get even worse , as " King David , " which recently inaugurated the New Amsterdam Theater in a limited run , made clear . This film-scorish " concert musical " by the composer Alan Menken and the lyricist Tim Rice was cloying and bombastic . Apparently , Mr. Menken is not satisfied writing cute songs for mermaids and singing teapots . But surely the many fans of his film musicals will be mystified by the loopy liturgical excess and campy extravagance of this score . <p> Mr. Rice 's incessant rhymed couplets kept jabbing at you like one-two punches . The amplification was pummelingly loud . I made it only to intermission , before I fled , craving the obliterating noise of Times Square . <p> But it 's not hopeless . William Finn , the composer of the literate , songful and humanely moving " Falsettos , " has a new work on deck . And Mr. Sondheim , our last best hope , has a work in progress as well . <p> Several months ago , audiences left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Syracuse , " the 1938 Rodgers and Hart musical , riding an ecstatic high , so stunning was its reminder of what musical theater can be when nifty lyrics are propelled to life by snappy music . And the show takes a couple of pokes at opera along the way too .
