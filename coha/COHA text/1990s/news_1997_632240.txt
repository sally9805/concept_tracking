<p> Walk through any newsroom and the scene is pretty much the same . You 'll see desks piled high with newspapers , files , notepads and books . Lots of books . <p> Writers are readers , naturally enough . So we asked Sun-Times reporters , columnists and contributors to tell us their favorite books from 1997 . <p> Movies <p> Who the Devil Made It by Peter Bogdanovich ( Knopf , $ 39.95 ) . <p> Who the Devil Made It is a feast of memories , history and tall tales , told by the directors who shaped the course of American movies , in long conversations over a period of years . It 's a massive book , and if the directors ramble , Bogdanovich is happy to let them ; sometimes they ramble straight for gold . Among the subjects are Howard Hawks , Raoul Walsh , Alfred Hitchcock , Leo McCarey and Fritz Lang ( " Did you know that I invented the countdown ? When I shot the takeoff , I said , ' If I count 1 , 2 , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it will go off . But if I count down . . . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , Zero  --  then they will know . ' " ) . <p> Roger Ebert , film critic <p> Rock <p> The Mansion on the Hill : Dylan , Young , Geffen , Springsteen , and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce by Fred Goodman ( Times Books , $ 25 ) . <p> The most eagerly awaited music-business expose since Fredric Dannen 's Hit Men , former Rolling Stone reporter Fred Goodman 's hefty tome did n't measure up in terms of truly revealing inside dirt , and its Baby Boomer myopia could be offensive to readers who did n't grow up thinking that Woodstock was the be-all and end-all of rock history . Despite these problems , The Mansion on the Hill was the best rock read of 1997 , charting the origins of the feud between art and commerce that has raged within the music since the idealistic ' 60s yielded to the materialistic ' 70s . The main characters are all cited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest hit : Goodman charges that manager Jon Landau virtually remade the Boss , creating a political and social conscience that was n't there before and which , by the time of " Born in the U.S.A. , " proved to be very good for business . This does n't change the quality of Springsteen 's music , of course . But it 's certainly entertaining to read about the gap between ( as Rolling Stone would say ) perception and reality . <p> Jim DeRogatis , pop music critic <p> Dance <p> Passion &; Line : Photographs of Dancers , by Howard Schatz ( Graphis , $ 50 ) . <p> Dance is an exceptionally difficult art form to capture in photographs . The camera freezes time ; dance defines and then discards it . Only a handful of photographers have demonstrated the ability to seize the perfect image of exquisite , highly trained and impossibly expressive bodies in motion . As this book demonstrates , Howard Schatz is one of them . He also is a master at capturing dancers in moments of repose , recognizing that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Drawing on a wide array of performers throughout the United States  --  including members of the San Francisco Ballet , Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater , the Paul Taylor Company and American Ballet Theater  --  Schatz 's vivid images remind you of the phrase Martha Graham used to describe her dancers . They were , she said , " acrobats of God . " Schatz 's subjects are almost unearthly creatures who can carve out space by outlining the air . <p> There is an unadulterated erotic component to these photographs , as well . Many of the dancers are nude or scantily clothed . But why would anyone want to dress up a jaguar or an eagle in mid-flight ? <p> Hedy Weiss , theater and dance critic <p> Americana <p> Inside U.S.A. by John Gunther ( New Press , $ 19.95 ) . <p> Over the summer , New Press released the 50th anniversary edition of reporter John Gunther 's Inside U.S.A. , a spellbinding collection of 52 essays that Gunther wrote in the 1930s and 1940s as he drove across America . A native Chicagoan who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Daily News . He is a no-nonsense writer , mincing few words as he explores the Tennessee Valley Authority , Henry Ford ( then 84 years old ) , and the magic of Harry Truman 's Independence , Mo. , which some Mormons think will be the scene of the Resurrection . <p> Many of Gunther 's observations are still pertinent , such as when he compared the Chicago Tribune to Soviet Russia ( one of the newspaper 's targets ) : " big , totalitarian , successful , dominated by one man as of the moment , suspicious of outsiders , cranky and with great natural resources not fully developed . " I became acquainted with his work when I was a kid and read Death Be Not Proud , Gunther 's tender memoir of his son 's battle with a brain tumor . Chase down a copy of Inside U.S.A. and follow Gunther 's warm tracks on your next road trip . <p> Dave Hoekstra , staff writer <p> Jazz <p> Space Is the Place : The Lives and Times of Sun Ra by John F. Szwed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect life , and life has a way of reflecting art , but seldom have those twains met as profoundly as they did in shaping the legend of Sun Ra . Laugh at his costumed antics and cosmic claims if you will , but as documented in Space Is the Place , the late avant-garde jazz pioneer was profoundly involved in the idea of being a brother from a less-cruel planet  --  and in creating music that embodied the high principles of freedom , equality and self-expression . <p> Perhaps in more detail than is needed , Szwed explores Ra 's philosophies and visions . He immerses us in the origins of the exuberant big band sound this native of Birmingham , Ala. , launched in Chicago in the mid- ' 50s . The reader is also privy to Ra 's exacting methods as a leader and unusual communal relationship with the core members of his longstanding  --  and long-neglected  --  Arkestra . <p> It 's a great story , told well . But the best thing about Space Is the Place is the appetite it whets for Ra 's music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ever be . <p> Lloyd Sachs , entertainment critic <p> Home improvement <p> The Tool Book , by William Bryant Logan , ( Workman Publishing Co. , $ 40 ) . <p> All the tools you need to know so you can build the coffee table this book should sit atop . <p> Hard to imagine , but author William Bryant Logan has written a coffee table book on tools . Who 'd ever imagine tools could be so colorful , so picturesque , so interesting ? The Tool Book is 300 pages of illustrations , historical notes and a guide on how to pick the right tool for any given task . <p> The book , frankly , is beautiful  --  this from a man who finds turning a spade akin to eating broccoli . Did you know there are 10 different types of pruning saw , including the traditional Japanese folding version and its American counterpart ? The Western version also comes with Japanese-style teeth , by the way . <p> If you 're a gardener , a wood-working hobbyist , or just need advice on whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen leaves , this well-organized book is recommended . <p> It even looks good next to the oversized Monet picture book on your coffee table . <p> Eric Benderoff , deputy features editor/real estate <p> Classical <p> Memoirs by Sir Georg Solti ( Knopf , $ 25.95 ) . <p> For classical music fans in Chicago , the top book of 1997 has to be Sir Georg Solti 's Memoirs . <p> The Chicago Symphony Orchestra 's music director laureate finished working on the manuscript a few hours before he died unexpectedly Sept. 5 , and Knopf issued it on Oct. 21 , which would have been Solti 's 85th birthday . The book is a lively memoir by one of the CSO 's greatest music directors and the last of the great post-World War II maestros . <p> Virtually by definition , autobiographies are selective remembrances . But it 's always valuable to see how great artists perceive themselves , and Solti 's perceptions of himself and the musical world around him are remarkably clear-eyed . <p> The uncertainty of his early struggles to make a career in Europe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II is vividly described . So is his love affair with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . The classical music world has changed irrevocably since Solti made his conducting debut on the eve of World War II . We truly shall not see his like again . <p> Wynne Delacoma , classical music critic <p> Sports <p> Jackie Robinson by Arnold Rampersad ( Knopf , $ 27.50 ) . <p> Rampersad 's meticulous and elegantly written story of Robinson 's life , which benefitted immensely from the cooperation of Robinson 's widow Rachel , is as important as any biography that appeared this year  --  or any year . <p> Rampersad accomplishes the formidable task of making Robinson a symbol of Jim Crow America , of the integration of this country 's major institutions and of the twists and turns of the civil rights movement , without ever losing sight of Robinson  --  the passionate but conflicted human being . <p> The story of how Robinson broke baseball 's color line has been told before , although never in such breathtaking detail . Rampersad 's signal achievement is to make Robinson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapoport , deputy sports editor <p> Travel <p> These Rare Lands : Images of America 's National Parks ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 40 ) . <p> With a whole world of topics to chose from , it 's no surprise that the offerings in the travel category are vast and varied . Great guide books aside , These Rare Lands : Images of America 's National Parks is at the top of my gift list for this holiday season . The topic is a classic and one explored by many , but this testimony to the country 's 54 national parks is as lovely a collection as one will find . Photographer Stan Jorstad 's lush photos capture the grandeur of each park , from Maine 's Acadia to Hawaii 's Haleakala . Former U.S. poet laureate Mark Strand enhances the photo collection with compelling reflections . A little bonus : an introduction by Robert Redford . <p> Mi-Ai Ahern , travel editor <p> Television <p> The Simpsons : A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family edited by Ray Richmond ( Harper Perennial , $ 15.95 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on television programs . <p> " The Simpsons , " a satiric cartoon series on the Fox network , is the current longest-running weekly program devoted to a working-class family . Now in its eighth season , Matt Groening 's creation has passed " The Flintstones " as the prime-time longevity champ among all animated TV shows . <p> The Complete Guide is a 249-page collection of " Simpsons " history and mythology . <p> " If ' The Simpsons ' is a show that rewards you for paying attention , " says Groening , " then this book is for that exalted and/or sorry bunch of you who just ca n't seem to stop paying attention . " <p> The guide includes character sketches , tons of trivia , factoids and catchphrases . " Seventeen people went totally insane in the making of this book , " Groening says . <p> Lon Grahnke , television critic <p> Media <p> A Reporter 's Life by Walter Cronkite ( Alfred A. Knopf , $ 26.95 ; Ballatine paperback , $ 14 ) . <p> I can die a happy man now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mentor , Walter Cronkite . Titled A Reporter 's Life , it 's the enthralling story of how an overworked and underpaid wire-service correspondent was instrumental in the creation of television news ( the term " anchorman " was coined for him ) and came to be known as " The Most Trusted Man in America . " <p> From his roots as a newsboy peddling the Kansas City Star to his status today as the revered elder statesman of broadcast journalism , Uncle Walter recalls in vivid detail his impressions as an eyewitness to the greatest triumphs and tragedies of the 20th century . <p> Ironically , his two decades at the helm of " The CBS Evening News " gave rise to the cult of personality surrounding the current crop of millionaire news anchors  --  a disturbing trend Cronkite decries . His book should be required reading for anyone who broadcasts the news  --  or watches it . <p> Robert Feder , television/radio <p> columnist <p> Art <p> American Visions : The Epic History of Art in America by Robert Hughes ( Knopf , $ 65 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine art critic Robert Hughes ' American Visions : The Epic History of Art in America is a meaty tome . Hitting the bookstands this spring to coincide with an eight-hour PBS series that aired in May , it was greeted by a contrapuntal chorus of rants and raves  --  some warranted , some not . <p> It is n't a perfect book . Five hundred years of Americans making art , and what one of the nation 's most widely read and outspoken writers has to say about it , is a pretty snug fit even for 636 pages . But as a wide-ranging ( and , yes , over-reaching ) survey aimed at the general reader with an interest in art , it offers lots of information , flashes of insight and even some gossipy tidbits . <p> Hughes ' examination of architecture , design , furniture , painting and sculpture and how they 've been influenced by commerce , politics , philosophy and religion is wonderfully descriptive and lively . Central to it all , he believes , is the American obsession with " newness . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and styles , this lavishly illustrated chronicle continuously weaves past and present art into a rich and textured whole cloth . <p> Garrett Holg , freelance art critic <p> Fashion <p> Secrets of a Fashion Therapist by Betty Halbreich ( Cliff Street Books , $ 25 ) . <p> Losing your mind over what to wear ? Seek help  --  from a fashion therapist , that is . <p> Chicago native Betty Halbreich is ready to counsel with her new book , Secrets of a Fashion Therapist . As director of Solutions at Bergdorf Goodman in New York , she 's been helping women get <p> dressed for every occasion . <p> Now she , along with Sally Wadyka , wants to help anyone willing to listen . The 204-page book is written in a conversational and comfortable tone . Halbreich provides sensible advice , taking into account various clothing budgets and tastes . She forces readers to take a cold , hard look at their bodies and assess what works best for them . She even gives tips on how to shop for clothes in the chapter " Taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Halbreich focuses on the basics <p> of good dressing . This timeless advice will help any reader make a quick recovery . <p> Lisa Lenoir , fashion writer <p> Celebrity <p> When Do I Start ? by Karl Malden with Carla Malden ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 25 ) . <p> This year , publishers threw money at anyone with a flashy name . Bookstores peddled Jenny McCarthy 's ( co-written ) autobiography , Jenny Jones ' ( co-written ) life story , even Tina Louise 's bizarre memoir ( unfortunately , not co-written ) . <p> But the best celebrity book was by the decidedly unflashy Malden , written with his daughter in a warm , anecdotal , thoughtful manner . There are no tales of drug addiction , no axes to grind , no ego trips  --  just the memories of an 85-year-old actor who accepted almost any job that would come his way by saying , " When do I start ? " <p> The book captures his love affair with acting without pretension . And the affair lasted  --  he tells of starring on Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " Patton , " and on TV 's " The Streets of San Francisco . " And today 's actors could learn from his professionalism . Acting was his job , and people like Marlon Brando , Michael Douglas and Barbra Streisand were his co-workers . <p> You 'll love the trip , even if you were n't around for it the first time . <p> Paige Smoron , assistant Showcase editor <p> Pop culture <p> Poison Pen : The True Confessions of Two Tabloid Reporters by Lysa Moskowitz-Mateu and David LaFontaine ( Dove Books , $ 18.95 ) . <p> There 's no guilty pleasure more delicious than reading the confessional purgings of semi-reformed scum . Lysa Moskowitz-Mateau was a staff reporter for Star magazine and has free-lanced for the National Enquirer and the Globe ; her ex-husband David LaFontaine was also on staff at the Star . Together they have produced a breezy , cheeky and sometimes appalling retelling of their adventures stalking the likes of Elizabeth Taylor , Tommy and Pamela Lee , Michael Jackson , and O.J. Simpson . ( The celebrity names drop like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Even more entertaining are the stories about the minor celebs  --  a Richard " Empty Nest " Mulligan , a Crystal " Wings " Bernard ,  --  whose private lives must be sullied for the tabloids to have enough copy every week . You wo n't like Moskowitz-Mateau or LaFontaine very much , but you 'll find them to be fascinatingly repellent creatures  --  much like the jackal or the vulture . <p> Richard Roeper , columnist <p> Cooking <p> Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone by Deborah Madison ( Broadway Books , $ 35 ) . <p> Deborah Madison has written the perfect book for someone who wants to eat healthfully , but is clueless in the kitchen . <p> Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone has more than 1,400 alluring recipes  --  from a fresh tomato sauce made with just five ingredients ( including salt and pepper ) to elegant spring asparagus soup to earthy , trendy goat cheese enchiladas with corn and red mole sauce . But it 's also a wealth of easy-to-understand help for beginners . <p> The inside cover lists definitions of the simplest recipe terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Introductory chapters explain such basics as how to hold a knife while chopping , and describe , in words and sketches , kitchen tools from measuring cups to a food mill . The 115-page vegetables section describes dozens of varieties and tells how to shop for , store and use them . Best of all , Madison , a founder of San Francisco 's landmark vegetarian restaurant Greens , demystifies vegetarianism . Even " if you do n't attach a title to your eating style , " she writes , " you can cook everything in this book and serve it with meat , fish or fowl . " That 's what I call vegetarian cooking for everyone . <p> Barbara Sadek , food editor
