With highest respect , I except the name of Heraclitus . When the rest of the philosophic folk rejected the testimony of the senses because they showed multiplicity and change , he rejected their testimony because they showed things as if they had permanence and unity . Heraclitus too did the senses an injustice , They neither lie in the way the Eleatics believed , nor as he believed  --  they do not lie at all . What we make of their testimony , that alone introduces lies ; for example , the lie of unity , the lie of thinghood , of substance , of permanence . " Reason " is the cause of our falsification of the testimony of the senses . Insofar as the senses show becoming , passing away , and change , they do not lie . But Heraclitus will remain eternally right with his assertion that being is an empty fiction . The " apparent " world is the ony one : the " true " world is merely added by a lie . Nietzsche , Twilight of the Idols : Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exempts Heraclitus from the charge levelled at other philosophes that in denigrating the senses and the body , and in dehistoricizing concepts , they kill them and stuff them , turning them into mummies . Nietzsche 's admiration of Heraclitus is not surprising in light of the resemblances between the two writers , not the least of which is that they inspire so many divergent , and contradictory , readings . As it becomes increasingly clear  --  thanks to Nietzsche and to those whom he inspired  --  that much more is contingent than we had thought , one hesitates to make too much of stylistic coincidence . Still it is worth exploring whether there is a connection between the style , structure , and content of what they wrote , and the extraordinary range of readings ascribed to the writings . <p> Of course , there are others who claim affinities with Heraclitus . Heidegger maintains that the history of Being had reached its highest point in Heraclitus , before it went awry with Plato. 1 Indeed , on Heidegger 's view , it is by " thinking with " Heraclitus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may be able to " think no longer metaphysically " about Being. 2 " To think ' Being ' no longer metaphysically " presumably means reconceptualizing the ways in which we are in the world , and the ways the world , and what is in the world , is or can be for us . According to Heidegger , Heraclitus recognized something about the way we can think " Being , " that is , he recognized something about the way that we think , or can think , about " that which can be thought . " In other words , Heraclitus saw something about how " that which can be thought " is thought by or through us . <p> That Heraclitus should be read in a radically different way from traditional classical readings has also been argued for by Eric Havelock , albeit on different grounds. 3 For Havelock , the classical scholarship of the last century argues against the anachronistic readings inspired by classical sources . The upshot of this scholarship , according to Havelock , is that from the archaic to the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic performance functioned as the primary vehicle for preserving and transmitting culturally significant communication , to a society in which those charged with cultural preservation and transmission were literate , that is , they were able to read and write their language , and employed these techniques in storing and retrieving information. 4 Thus Havelock warns against reading Heraclitus or any of the early Greek philosophers up to and including Plato as engaged in philosophical discourse as we know it , i.e. , identifying " perennial " philosophical problems that arise when one " does philosophy " regardless of the context and the material and the cultural conditions governing one 's " thought . " Havelock 's warning combines nicely with Heidegger 's observation that the " unexpressed standard " governing Nietzsche 's characterization of early Greek thinkers as Preplatonic philosophers is the " philosophy of Plato and Aristotle ... the Greek philosophers who set the standard both before and after themselves . " 5 Indeed , Havelock could have just as easily written Heidegger 's comment that <p> ... even when philological and historical research treat the philosophers before Plato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concepts , in modem transformations , still guide the interpretation . That is also the case when attempts are made to locate what is archaic in early thinking by finding parallels in classical archaeology and literature . Classic and classicist representations prevail . We expatiate on archaic logic , not realizing that logic occurs for the first time in the curriculum of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. 6 <p> Even more to the point is the recognition by Nietzsche , Heidegger , and their postmodernist " followers " that philosophers typically take Platonic and Aristotelian concepts and representations as the standard for philosophy , period , though they fail to recognize their having done so. 7 That recent English-language analytic philosophy would do this is particularly ironic since its conception of the history of philosophy derives from the type of Whiggish history that one finds in Hans Reichenbach 's Rise of Scientific Philosophy , which claims that the virtue of such philosophy is that it has overcome its Platonist past and become scientific. 8 It is part of this view that the history of philosophy is history , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the history of philosophy , since it is not philosophy . Those who hold this view are thus likely to be ignorant of the origins of their conception of the history of philosophy , and unlikely to discover how ill-formed their conceptions of philosophy and its history are . The situation is exacerbated by the fact that philosophy , like science from which it takes its direction , continues to be conceived , as Plato conceived of it , as consisting of timeless problems  --  what is knowledge or truth or goodness or beauty  --  that are to be resolved , in time , using the timeless concepts of mathematics , logic and analysis . If earlier thinkers are to be part of " doing philosophy , " they must be " rationally reconstructed , " i.e. , recast into the language of contemporary philosophy . When this practice constitutes doing the history of philosophy , the historical origns of philosophical concepts are masked even for those trying to recover them . <p> But the recognition that philosophical problems about the " foundations " of knowledge , truth , morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representations and concepts of Plato and Aristotle makes the study of the history of philosophy more difficult , not easier . PostEnlightenment philosophy 's slowly dawning recognition that there is no " innocent eye " or " immaculate perception "  --  that perception , conception , and description require some language , theory , or set of structures  --  affects historical descriptions as well as scientific or philosophical ones . If our languages and theories do not mirror " reality " but instead give it its structure , we can not separate what exists " out there , " or what was true " back then , " from the language or theories used in our accounts of them . But why would one suppose that a universal vocabulary that transcends the vocabularies of particular societies at particular times exists for history , when it is doubtful that such a vocabulary exists for philosophy or science ? If our descriptions of the world and ourselves seem to be , as Rorty says , " created by the use of a vocabulary rather than being adequately or inadequately expressed in a vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others ' descriptions of their worlds and themselves , but also for our accounts of these descriptions and our accounts of the vocabulary in which these descriptions were formulated. 9 The greater the difference between our vocabulary and theirs , the more difficult will it be for us to give an historical account  --  or an anthropological or ethnographical account  --  of them . If one is persuaded by Havelock that differences in the ways in which vocabularies are used for preserving and transmitting culturally significant information affect the content of what is communicated , then historical or ethnographical accounts of other cultures must take into account whether the vocabulary of this culture was part of an oral and traditional " technology " for cultural communication , or a literate one  --  or part of a transitional phase from one to the other . If one accepts the classical scholarship suggesting that the Presocratics were an integral part of just such a phase in early Greek society , then giving an historical account of these thinkers will be an even more complicated task . If , as Havelock and Heidegger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a transition to the representations and conceptions of Plato and Aristotle , then an historical account of the Presocratics will be an account of Greek thought when it was not yet metaphysics or philosophy . If , as Derrida has suggested , the philosophical tradition that is written by Plato and Aristotle typically appears to ' privilege " speech over writing then this tradition will disguise not only its written origins , but also the way(s) in which writing affects speech . 10 Frequently , this will take the form of " hiding in plain sight " ; writing will be made to seem as transparent as speech , which is thought to " mirror " both thought and the world . <p> Given recent developments in post-Enlightenment philosophy and classical scholarship , the suggestion that Heraclitus might or should be read as a postmodern philosopher may not be so far-fetched after all . 11 An obvious problem with this suggestion is that there is only slightly less ( or is it slightly more ? ) disagreement about what constitutes postmodernism as there is about what Heraclitus really meant . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " what did Heraclitus really mean ? " Since on this reading , he did not really mean one thing . Indeed , it is the virtue of this reading or its vice , depending on one 's perspective that Heraclitus meant , and tried to show that he meant , several things at once . A Heideggerian reading of Heraclitus takes a similar position . To quote Kenneth Maly : <p> Is the thinking of Heraclitus carried out in such a way that it demands to be left uncertain  --  that the thinking , when properly heeded , requires , as part of its essential character , not to be quantified , systematized , or fully unfolded  --  and thus that any yearning for correctness of interpretation that ( one would " mesh " ) would necessarily come from something external to the thinking itself ? That is , does Heraclitus ' thinking image itself in such a way as to call upon genuine thinking to hold back ? Does the issue remain for Heraclitus somehow always a question ? Would the enigmatic character of his sayings still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as a unified text ? The sayings are not oracular or enigmatic because we have lost the coherent context . Rather the issue for Heraclitus ' thinking is itself enigmatic . The oracular saying " neither reveals nor conceals , but rather gives hints " ( B 93 ) . Heraclitus is " the Obscure " because the issue in his thinking ( disclosure ) remains essentially  --  for him and for us  --  a question. 12 <p> Bernd Magnus provides a clear statement of the forms post-modernism takes in philosophy. 13 According to Magnus , the following are features of postmodernist philosophy : <p> its putative anti ( or post ) epistemological standpoint ; its anti-essentialism ; its anti-realism about meaning and reference ; its antifoundationalism ; its suspicion of transcendental arguments and transcendental standpoints ; its rejection of the picture of knowledge as accurate representation ; its rejection of truth as correspondence to reality ; its rejection of canonical descriptions and final vocabularies ; and its suspicion of metanarratives ( p. 302 ) . <p> Magnus also identifies something akin to a " postmodern attitude towards theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally crucial " ( p. 302 ) . This attitude can be seen by comparing the modernist , lapsed modernist , and postmodernist responses to the question , " If from our current vocabulary we could subtract our current vocabulary , what , if anything , remains left over ? 14 The responses to the question may be summarized as follows : a ) the modernist or metaphysical realist asks whether ours is the " right vocabulary " ; b ) the lapsed modernist responds , " nothing , alas " ; c ) the postmodernist responds " nothing " ( no " alas " ) . 15 What prompts the " alas " from the lapsed modernist is that he assumes if nothing remains then " everything is permitted . " The lack of an " alas " from the postmodernist is understood by Magnus as a result not of her having formulated a transcendental argument , but of her having " drawn a moral from the history of our own philosophical practice . Crudely put , the presumption of the history of philosophy counts against the metaphysical realist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a canonical consensus on any ' philosophical ' question " ( p. 302 ) . <p> According to Magnus , the affinities Nietzsche has with post-modernists include perspectivism , the diagnosis and critique of binarism and the metaphysics of presence , the substitution of genealogical narratives for ontology , the disarticulation of the self , the erasure of the boundaries between philosophy and literature , and the self-consuming , self-deconstructive nature of his own discourse and categories ( pp. 304-05 ) . To this list one might add a feature of postmodernist that is implicit in many of the features identified by Magnus , and so obvious that it usually does not require mention  --  the role of language(s) in establishing perspective , binary oppositions , foundations , etc . I want to explore whether Heraclitus has any affinities with Nietzsche and with postmodernists , and whether these similarities can be explained by taking up some suggestions of Havelock , Heidegger , and Derrida . <p> That Heraclitus did not respect boundaries between philosophy and literature hardly needs argument . The attempt to distinguish philosophy from literature had not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument is when , exactly , something like the modern notion of philosophical discourse , as a distinct genre of writing , was first conceived . Havelock 's writings on literacy and Greek culture , taken together , may be seen as a sustained argument about the how and when of the emergence of philosophical writing . It makes no sense to ask for an argument that philosophical writing had a how and when of emerging ; the burden of argument surely rests with those who would think that writing and philosophy have always been human activities . Derrida 's writings , taken as a whole , may be seen as a sustained inquiry into how philosophical writing , as a genre , disguises , among other things , that it is a genre of writing . Pace Plato , it makes no sense to ask whether philosophical writing is a genre of writing , though it is a mark of Plato 's influence that philosophers think otherwise . <p> As a genre of writing , philosophical writing pretends ( or " pretenses " ) that the writing of philosophy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that writing merely records or inscribes speech . And it is a special kind of speech that philosophical writing " merely " inscribes : speech that while grammatically tensed is logically tenseless , speech that is not historical or contextual , speech , in short , that consists of propositions . But with the possible exception of the everyday speech of philosophers or others who devote their lives to pursuing timeless propositions , everyday speech  --  parole  --  does not characteristically take the form of propositions without history or context . Indeed , until quite recently , philosophers did not put much stake in everyday speech ; there is no shortage of examples of philosophical writers castigating hoi polloi for the " ordinariness " of their speech , thought , and way(s) of life . Philosophy has rarely , if ever , been a democratic institution ; even " ordinary language " philosophers talk in a way that many of their fellow language users find peculiar and not at all ordinary . More importantly , the notion that philosophy consists in the recognition , or as Plato would have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Derrida notes , parasitic on its being " inscribed " somewhere . According to Plato 's Socrates , it is " inscribed " in the soul because of its previous experience with the Forms . In subsequent philosophical writing , these propositions are also inscribed , though in somewhat different ways . For Descartes , they are innate , lying in wait for the " natural light of reason " to rediscover them ; for empirically-minded philosophers of nature , they are inscribed in nature ; for Kant , they are the a priori forms that judgments and experience must take . Even for referential semantics of more recent times , these propositions must be inscribed somewhere , at least formally . <p> I take Derrida 's point to be that for those who are the products of the ' logocentric " tradition , or as Havelock would have it , literates , the notion of speech is parasitic on the notion of writing or inscription . Derrida and Havelock do not and need not conflict on this point , appearances to the contrary notwithstanding. 16 Indeed , the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of cultural communication is " storage " or " inscription " in the memory . That Havelock would so conceive of a traditional , oral culture attests to , rather than contests , Derrida 's claims about the hold that the 1ogocentric tradition has on those who are educated within it . Havelock 's recourse to this trope in his metanarrative about Greek literacy does not undermine his claim that it is with actual alphabetic writing that philosophical writing  --  and thinking  --  as we know it , become possible . It is with actual alphabetic writing , then , that being logocentric becomes possible  --  that language itself , i.e. , the special kind of speech that constitutes philosophical writing , becomes the vehicle and the subject of a new kind of inquiry , the results of which are part of what is preserved and transmitted through a literate " technology of cultural communication . " 17 <p> " Philosophical writing " owes much to Plato and to the Presocratics . The latter are , as Havelock says , " poised between literacy and nonliteracy " ( p. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style that is a " form of mediation between ear and eye , " and " expect an audience of listeners , yet look forward to an audience of readers " ( p. 9 ) . What prompts philosophical writing . Havelock suggests , is <p> the changing technology of the written word . Documented description of the environment , even at the Hesiodic level , tended already to separate what was described from the spoken speech of the describer . It rendered the logos in which it was written an artifact , an object separate from the describer 's own consciousness . As this happened , the opportunity arose , and the desire with it , to render the object more explicit , to tie it down as a system or structure instead of a series of events issuing from the mouth of a poet or muse . In short , while the environment had from our point of view always existed for the oral mind , this mind had not conceptualized and objectified it as an environment . The Presocratics not only had to invent a terminology suitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a " world " or a cosmos existed to be described . 18 <p> it is difficult for those in the logocentric tradition , i.e. , literates , to speak or to conceive of the preservation and transmission of culturally significant information without recourse to metaphors or analogies like the human memory is an analogue of the book in which information is inscribed or stored . That is , after all , Havelock 's  --  and Derrida 's  --  point . In a literate 1ogocentric tradition we could expect such metaphors would regularly appear in discussions of memory , whether human or mechanical , even though it is a part of this tradition to identify language with speech , or not to distinguish speech and writing . Thus the point at which Havelock 's and Derrida 's metanarratives seem to differ  --  the priority of speech to writing  --  turns out not to be a difference at all . For Derrida , our accounts of speech and writing are part of a tradition , ongoing since Plato , in which the " privileging " of speech over writing encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " exact , scientific , rigorous " language , " mirrors " or represents the world , where " world " refers either to a transcendent reality or nature , or both . Who writes this " speech " at what time for which audience , or , indeed , whether this speech is written , is on this logocentric view contingent , irrelevant or both , since the One , True Vocabulary is out there  --  or , in here  --  for any one , or at least anyone who is sophos or a lover of sophia to find . To suggest , as Havelock does , that philosophy awaits something so historical and contingent as alphabetic writing , is to undermine the logocentric tradition and its view of philosophy . To suggest , further , that in some respects , the One , True Vocabulary is a function of anything so material , historical , and contingent as a Greek speaker who happened to be familiar with the Phoenician syllabary having the need or desire to record something , and clay , leather , papyrus , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of view that those claiming to know the One , True Vocabulary , and have considerable stake in this claim , are going to warmly or easily embrace. 19 Indeed , it is not an idea that they are even likely to formulate , it is so at odds with the tradition . <p> Havelock 's attempt to identify the historical , material , and cultural conditions prompting the tradition that Derrida calls 1ogocentric must inevitably be cast in the language of this tradition , though this language may , indeed , if Derrida is correct , will point to something within itself or which preceded it that will undermine the tradition 's claims about itself . Havelock has identified the language and style of oral poetic performance , as well as references to such performances in early Greek language , literature , and " philosophy . " " Performance " is an answer to questions like , " how would members of a non-literate society , that is , those who do not have recourse to metaphors like inscription , think to maintain their cultural identity ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in what ways would they identify themselves ? 20 Responses to questions about how nonliterates think such performances occur might be found in Hesiod 's Theogony in which he says " that a muse breathed into him a voice to sing of things as they are , were in the past , and will be , " or in the account of the journey to the goddess that Parmenides mythologizes for his audience , or in Ion 's claim in Plato 's dialogue to be entheos , god-filled , when he recites Homer . Interestingly enough , a literate 's account of how oral composition and performance is possible , i.e. , the echo-principle , is not inconsistent with such explanations . 21 <p> If we read Heraclitus as one who " does not yet think metaphysically , " that is , as one who is thinking and writing before the literate logocentric tradition fashioned by Plato and Aristotle , the reasons for Nietzsche and Heidegger 's admiration may become clearer . For Heraclitus the " logos could be rendered an artifact , separated from his consciousness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of events issuing from the mouth of a poet or muse , " enabling him to think about the logos in terms other than those formulated in the tradition of metaphysics and philosophy enshrined by Plato and Aristotle . In a sense , then , Heraclitus represents for " western philosophy " the road not taken , one that both Nietzsche and Heidegger seem to think would have been preferable to that actually followed . <p> We must be careful not to assume that Heraclitus ' style was merely a concession to audience expectation he must make in order to " publish " his philosophical or metaphysical musings , unless we are also willing to assume , despite evidence to the contrary , that we are by nature metaphysical animals . Nor should we assume that Heraclitus ' " fragments " are fragments from longer sentences constituting paragraphs of sustained philosophical prose , i.e. , a " book , " an assumption that comes so easily to one from a literate 1ogocentric tradition that he or she is apt to forget that this notion needs argument and can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument for this claim has not been forthcoming , that something like an opposite view seems to be the case . Besides , Nietzsche had the alternative of " philosophical writing " available to him , yet he chose to erase the boundary between philosophy and literature , and to do so in a way that is reminiscent of Heraclitus. 22 <p> Heraclitus ' sayings will be seen , then , as sayings or texts , a number of features of which reflect , as Havelock and Robb note , origins in oral composition and/or performance , and not as answers to as yet unasked Socratic questions , i.e. , propositions , the meaning of which is independent of the time , place , and context of their utterance . That Heraclitus may have had to compose in a style designed for an audience of listeners does not , of course , preclude the possibility that the choice of this style might serve other purposes as well . It still makes sense to ask the question " how would one expect a person who writes like that to think ? 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , and exploitation of popular sayings are rarely given the attention they deserve . 24 The tone of much Heraclitean scholarship , a tone that might be appropriate , say , for Book Lambda of Aristotle 's Metaphysics , seems very much at odds with the tone of Heraclitus ' fragments . The style and content of Heraclitus ' sayings , and the notion that philosophy as we know it had yet to emerge , suggests we should be wary of reading too much philosophy , let alone philosophical profundity , into these fragments . Moreover , we might get a rather different reading of Heraclitus if we assume that word-play , riddling , puns , and the use or misuse of popular sayings signals that their author is , or wishes to appear , ironic , sardonic , and in possession of considerable wit . Surely the following fragments , even though they lack in translation some of the humor and word-play found in the Greek , support this reading : <p> B 4 If happiness consisted in the pleasures of the body , we should call oxen happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 They vainly try to purify themselves with blood when they are defiled I with/t !  --  which is as if one who had stepped into the mud should try to wash himself off with mud.t He would be thought mad , were any man to notice him doing so doing . Furthermore , they pray to these statues !  --  which is as though oxen were to try to carry on a conversation with houses , without any recognition of who gods and heroes really are : B 15 If it were not in Dionysus ' honour thay they make a procession and sign a hymn to the shameful parts , their deed would be a most shameful one . But Hades and Dionysus , for whom they rave and celebrate the festival of the Lenaea , are one and the same ; B 22 Those who seek gold dig up a great deal of earth and find little ; B 37 Pigs wash themselves with mud , while farmyard birds wash with dust or ashes ; B 40 A lot of learning does not each a person the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so taught Hesiod and Pythagoras , or for that matter , Xenophanes and Hecataeus ; B 42 Homer ought by rights to be ejected from the lists and thrashed , and similarly Archilochas ; B 43 There is a greater need to extinguish hubris than there is a blazing fire ; B 46 thinking is an instance of the sacred disease and that sight is deceptive ; B 48 The bow 's name then ? is life ( bios ) but its job is death.t ; B 52 Lifetime is a child playing , moving pieces in a backgammon ( ? ) game , ' kingly power or ; the kingdom is in the hands of a child ; B 58 Doctors , who cut and burn , complain that they do not receive an appropriate fee for doing these things ; B 59 The way of writing is straight and crooked ; B 60 A road up and down is one and the same road , ' B 95 It is better to conceal ignorance ; B 96 Corpses are more fit to be thrown out than dung ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning and end are one ; B 111 Disease makes health pleasant and good , hunger satiety , weariness rest ; B 124 The most beautiful order in the universe ? or : the ( this ) most beautiful universe is a heap of sweepings , piled up at random. 25 <p> That Heraclitus is contemputuous of popular wisdom , and of those whom it regards as its canonical thinkers and poet , as well as the things , people , and customs which it holds in high esteem is evident in B 4 , B 5 , B 15 , B 40 , B 42 , B 43 , as well as B 104  --  What discernment or intelligence do they possess ? They place their trust in popular bards , and take the throng for their teacher , not realizing that " the majority are bad , and only few are good "  --  and B 121  --  The adult Ephesians should be all rights go hang themselves , leaving the city to adolescents . For they expelled Hermodoros , the most valuable among them saying , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable among us . If such there purports to be , let him be so elsewhere and among others . " One also finds instances of explicit or implicit criticism of things , people , or customs traditionally valued by the populace in B 46 , B 52 , B 58 , B 95 , B 96 , and B 124 , translated above , Indeed , Heraclitus ' exploitation of popular sayings which takes the form , as Robb notes , of twisting their meaning , giving them an " epistemological edge " or generating fiat-out contraditions , is especially telling in this regard. 26 For , like Nietzsche , Heraclitus is using the tradition against the tradition to show that it is a tradition , and by no means the only way of thinking or speaking that is available , and that from another perspective , what it takes to be true or holy or good might appear just the opposite . Thus Heraclitus ' recognition of perspectivism in B 5 , B 15 , B 37 , B 52 , B 59 , B 60 , B 96 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated above ; as well as in the following fragments : <p> B 3 The sun 's breadth is that of a human foot ; B 9 For the pleasures of horse , dog , and man are different things , according to Heraclitus , who says that donkeys would prefer refuse m gold ; B 49a We step and do not step into the same rivers ; we are and are not ; B 61 Seal-water is very pure and very foul water  --  for fish drinkable and life sustaining , for people undrinkable and lethal ; B 67 God is day and night , winter and summer , war and peace , satiety Janeil famine , and undergoes changes in the way that ( fire ? ) whenever it is mixed with spices , gets called by the name that accords with the bouquet of each spice ; B 72 They are separated from that with which they are in the most continuous contact ; B 82 ... the most handsome of apes is ugly in comparison with a member of the human race ; B 84a While changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and just , whereas humans have supposed that some things are unjust , other things just ; n 107 Poor witnesses for people are eyes and ears if they possess uncomprehending ( literally , ' barbarian ' ) souls ; and B 126 Cold things become warm , a warm thing becomes cold ; a moist thing becomes dry , a parched thing becomes moist . <p> In the last fragment and B 67 and B 111 , translated above , Heraclitus seems to recognize binary oppositions , that is , linguistic expressions that get their meaning from each other . His recognition of binary oppositions is also suggested in the following : <p> B 8 ... what opposes unites , and that the finest attunement stems from things bearing in opposite directions , and that all things come about by strife ; B 10 Things grasped together : things whole , things not whole ; something being brought together , something being separated ; something consonant , something dissonant .

Or : Mortals are immortals , immortals mortals , these ( the latter ? ) living in ? the death of those ( the former ) , those ( the former ? ) dead in the life of these ( the latter ? ) <p> His diagnosis of binarism may be seen as constituting a critique of what postmodernists call " the metaphysics of presence " if other of the fragments , viz. , the Logos fragments , are taken as evidence of a recognition on Heraclitus ' part that language is a , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , and foundations provided , for intelligible experience of what exists . Such a recognition may have followed from the " separation of what was described from the spoken speech of the describer , " and from " the logos in which it was written being an artifact , an object separate from the describer 's own consciousness . " The inscription of language allows the writer to see language itself as an object of study. 27 <p> The suggestion , tentative though it must be , is that at crucial times in Heraclitus logos , though in the singular , means something like language as what is actually used in speaking or talking about something , in giving an account or description or narrative of something , but not language in the abstract sense in which it is studied by linguistics , since language in this sense is an abstract construction , not something that is spoken . On this reading B 1 roughly means that of the language that is always used in saying or talking about something , men always fail to be comprehending , both before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For although all things happen according to logos , i.e. , according to some description or account in language , they are like people without experience , their experience being of utterances and deeds like Heraclitus ' own dividing each thing according to nature and explaining how it exists . Logos , the language used in saying and talking or telling a story about things , is common to all , and though it is common , the many live as though they had a private understanding ( B 2 ) . It is tempting to understand B 2 as a criticism of those who think their experience is not mediated through a common language , but consists in their own sensations . Similarly B 9 is critical of those who are asleep and turned away into their own private world , that is the world of their private sensations , ( B 89 ) while for those who are awake , i.e. , can see and hear , there is a common universe because of logos . The problem is that people do not know how to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not know that with which they speak or to which they listen . They are uncomprehending even when they have heard the logos , like deaf people , the saying " absent , while present , " bears witness to them . They should not act and speak like children ( B 74 ) . <p> But one should not understand Heraclitus on this reading as an idealist . The point is that if we are to talk about whatever exists we must do so under some description . Any descriptions one gives for it will be true , but also not true , since not only will it go under different names  --  day , night , winter , summer , war , peace , satiety , famine , in the way that fire whenever it is mixed with spices gets called by the name that accords with a bouquet of each ( B 67 )  --  but also because what is now one thing , fire , air , water , a soul or a body , not only requires its opposite in order to be meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76b , 76c , 77 ) . The point is not only that it can be re-described , but that the descriptions that we commonly give require that it be described first and one thing and then as its opposite . <p> Yet Heraclitus also shows that it is possible to describe it in the way thatphusikoi do . One can say that the cosmos was not made by man or god , but what always was , is , and will be an everliving fire , being kindled in measure and being put out in measures ( B 30 ) ; that the totality of things is an exchange for fire , and fire an exchange for all things ( B 90 ) . Then it is wise to conclude that wisdom is knowing this one thing , the plan that steers all things through things ( B 41 ) . Humans , then , do not have the right understanding , the divine does ( B 78 ) . This does not mean that the divine should be thought of in the way that Homer and Hesiod think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called Zeus ( B 32 ) . Because phusis likes to hide ( B 123 ) just as the lord whose oracle is at Delphi does not indicate clearly nor conceals but gives a sign ( B 93 ) , it is better to leave it at " the thunderbolt steers all things " ( B 64 ) . <p> Fire , for Heraclitus , may be a redescription of what exists , a symbol of that of which logos is an account or description , and/or a symbol of the self-consuming nature and self-destructive nature of the accounts given , including that given by Heraclitus : Of all those accounts I have listened to , none gets to the point of recognizing that which is wise , set apart from all ( B 108 ) . Those who claim to know that which is wise and set apart from all ,  --  the most esteemed  --  ascertain and hold fast to what merely seems to be the case ( B 28a ) . Those who simply accept appearances as appearances might , indeed , be wise , for Heraclitus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing , and experience ( B 55 ) , what Nietzsche calls the apparent world . To accept appearance as appearance requires a certain confidence . This knowledge will escape those who do not have the proper attitude ( B 86 ) . It is tempting to take this as saying that no " alas " should accompany the recognition that other than logos , that is , the accounts we give of things , including Heraclitus ' , there is fire , period , albeit an everlasting , and therefore , divine fire . While this divinity promises nothing for humans , Heraclitus ' attitude toward this fact is not apt to be one of nostalgia , regret or a keen sense of loss , for the " alas " response only makes sense for those whose conceptions of divinity and nature had promised more . Of course , we do not find in Heraclitus the image of the self or soul that appears so often in philosphical writing , for this , too , is a Platonic legacy . Rather than a self with well-articulated boundaries , Heraclitus speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a logos that is so deep that we can not discover the limits of soul ( B 45 ) . The soul of which Heraclitus speaks does not sound unlike the self that results once it is has been disarticulated by Nietzsche and postmodernist philosophers . <p> Still , if Heraclitus ' choice of the saying was dictated not only by the desire to be appreciated and remembered by his audience , but also because the saying has , or can be made to have , different meanings or different levels of meaning , then , perhaps , we should be hesitant in taking the " cosmological fragments " too seriously , or more seriously than we take the others . We would not want to be like a stupid person who gets all worked up over every statement he hears ( B 87 ) , nor like Homer who could be deceived by words ( B 56 ) . The eyes or the ears are not to be trusted if possessed by " barbarian " souls , i.e. , souls that do not understand the language in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care not to be among the fabricators of falsehoods , or among those who bear witness to them , because Justice will catch up with these ( B 28b )  --  fire will judge and convict them ( B 66 ) . 28 Of course , these fragments need not be taken literally ; indeed , it is hard to understand why a writer like Heraclitus would be taken literally . Besides , as Heidegger points out , the cosmological interpretation " says too much " . Most of that " too much " takes the form of modes of thought and language indigenous to metaphysics , which project onto Heraclitus what  --  for all we know  --  was never there . " 29 Even Heidegger 's reading  --  especially Heidegger 's reading  --  will not provide an ontology of the sort philosophical writing favors , but a narrative about the appearances of Being . On a Heideggerian reading , Heraclitus may have recognized that although phenomena reveal themselves in language and in its junctures , 30 Being is disclosed in the phenomena . <p> In reading Heraclitus , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed in " philosophical writing " which is , after all , a quite different genre of writing from that of Heraclitus . His is not the special kind of speech that such writing inscribes ; speech that is grammatically tensed but logically tenseless , speech that is not historical or contextual but consists of timeless propositions . Why should Heraclitus be read as an essentialist , a realist about meaning and reference , a foundationalist who accepts the picture of knowledge as accurate representation and truth as correspondence , and as one who assumes a transcendental standpoint from which he may give a canonical description , a metanarrative in The One True Vocabulary ? These are descriptions developed by a literate logocentric tradition from the concepts and representations of Plato and Aristotle . Heraclitus does not write like that kind of philosopher ; like Nietzsche and the postmodernists who follow him , Heraclitus philosophizes with a hammer , used like a tuning fork. 31 <p>
