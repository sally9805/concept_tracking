On the sixth day of her hunger strike Lydia Martinez entered my dreams and immediately died there . She died so convincingly that I awoke and for a few moments could not imagine her alive again . I had to force it . I forced it and then I saw her , behind a Bunsen burner , her pretty face framed inside her black hair and lit by the lapping blue flame . I felt better , much better , but as much as I tried I could not fall asleep again . Lydia was not just any girl ; besides being the brightest , she was my One and Only  --  the one and only student I was allowed to think about in that way I thought about her . <p> " Do you know what day it is ? " I asked Pearl the next morning in the teachers ' lounge , over a cigarette . Pearl was my ex-girlfriend  --  an English teacher . Through an arrangement the two of us shared , she was allowed to think about Gabriel , her One and Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the girl 's hunger strike . Think only , Pearl and I had agreed ; that way no one gets hurt . At least that was the way it had started . <p> Pearl blew smoke out her nostrils . " How could I not know ? " she said . " She stage-whispers it to him every day in homeroom : ' I 'm on Day Five , Gabriel , ' she says . ' Day Six today . ' She 's got him worried to death . " <p> " He did n't seem particularly worried in Earth Science this morning , " I said . " But just for the record , it 's Day Seven . Seven days since you drove the boy home . " <p> Pearl blew a mouthful of smoke at the dirty window that overlooked two granite benches donated by the Class of ' 78 . The windows in the teachers ' lounge were never cleaned . The janitors refused , the teachers refused . No one else was allowed inside . <p> Then Pearl looked at me with tears balanced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always used to great effect . " Chris , I 'm just barely making it , " she said . " Sometimes I think I 'm not going to make it . I know it 's not the smart thing to do , but I 'm just barely hanging on . A skin-of-the-teeth kind of thing . Do you know what I mean ? " <p> " Oh , Pearl . " My voice was more tender than I wanted it to be . " Do n't be dramatic . He 's just a boy . Think about it . " <p> " That 's the trouble  --  it 's all I think about . " She laughed , and the laugh dislodged the tears . <p> " Anyway , " she said , " it 's not like I expect you to know what I 'm talking about . " She sniffed out another laugh and then sighed . " I 'm really very sorry I said that . " <p> " Forget it , " I said <p> There was a pause , and after a moment I filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She snorted . " I do n't give two shits about Lydia and her stupid hunger strikes . She 'll quit just like the other times . She always eats eventually . " <p> " No , " I said , " she never just quits . Gabriel always comes back to her , then she eats . That 's not the same as quitting . " <p> " She 'll quit this time . I 'll bet you anything she 's eating by Friday . " <p> I did n't say anything for a moment , then I rubbed my eyes hard . " I 'm having trouble sleeping , " I said . <p> " Again ? " Pearl mashed the nose of her cigarette in the center of the ashtray . It stayed there , bent and broken , its pink end in the air . <p> " Why do they humor her ? " she said . " They should yank her out of school when she pulls this stuff . It 's only for the attention . They should just yank her out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stray papers blew across the grass . A girl shrieked and a bad muffler blatted into the distance . <p> " Who 's they ! " I said . <p> I had only kissed Lydia , and I had only done it once . It happened last week on Parents ' Night . Lydia 's father  --  of all people  --  sought me out at the front lab station , where I was explaining the periodic table to a single mom whose child was nowhere to be found . He drew up behind me and out of the corner of my eye I could see him shifting his weight from foot to foot . Lydia hung back in the doorway and watched us , her tiny chin low to her chest . From that distance the pupils of her eyes , lost inside dark irises , seemed enormous . <p> " What is this about ? " he asked when the woman had left . He waved a paper in front of my eyes . <p> I took the paper from him and read it . It took two passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra equipment , " I said , handing it back . " It 's just a deposit . If nothing is broken it 's all refunded at the end of the semester . " <p> He examined the paper doubtfully . Lydia turned her face away from the room . <p> " Just in time for Christmas , " I added . By then the vice-principal had noticed the scene developing from his office across the hall , where he was entertaining a man in a business suit . He glanced at Lydia and then frowned at me . The man in the suit spoke to him but the vice-principal continued frowning through the doorway . <p> " I pay this already , " Lydia 's father said , staring at the paper He looked panicked . " Already pay . " <p> The vice-principal circled around the man in the suit to be closer . " Great , " I said , taking the sheet " Thank you . " <p> Lydia 's father nodded uncertainly and turned to leave . He was almost at the door and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to me . She was pale . Her black hair fell into her face , as if she were hiding behind it . The vice-principal escaped from the man in the suit and stood right in the doorway next to my poster of the Curies . He stood with his nose slightly in the air , sniffing scandal . <p> " This , " Lydia 's father said . " This is my daughter . " <p> I nodded at him . My hands went in and out of my pockets . <p> " You know her , " he said . He was starting to look angry . <p> " Yes , " I said . Madame Curie and the vice-principal stared at me . <p> " She is paid . " <p> " Yes , of course , Mr. Martinez , " I said . " My mistake . " When I said his name , Lydia 's father nodded at me and let go of her arm . The fabric of her sleeve remained puckered where he had gripped her . He walked out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been collared once again by the businessman , She never looked up . <p> At half past nine I snapped the locks shut on my briefcase and closed the door to the classroom behind me . Pearl had left long ago , and I walked across the varsity diamond to the teachers ' parking lot . When I reached it Lydia was sitting on the trunk of my car with her feet on the bumper . Her hands were pressed between her knees and her hair fell on either side of her face . <p> " Gabriel went off with her , " she said , not looking up . " Why did n't you stop them ? " <p> " It 's nothing , " I said . " There 's nothing to worry about . " I was too tired and too disappointed to think about Pearl anymore . She and I had played out our big scene just a few days before . My feelings and faults , so recently exhumed , lingered about me like an unpleasant odor . I put my briefcase down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five or six things to say but instead I leaned over , moved her hair , and kissed her . She did n't raise her head and I almost missed her pretty mouth . I felt the soft , slick tip of her tongue , just for an instant , but for the most part she gave me nothing . I kept my face next to hers for a moment , and then I straightened up . <p> " It 's all so disappointing , " she said . She pulled her knees up to her chin . <p> I felt my face heat up stupidly . " What is ? " I said . <p> " Everything , " she said . " Just everything . " <p> " Well , you do n't have to worry , I wo n't do that again . " <p> She finally raised her head , but I could n't see her eyes in the shadows . She did n't say anything for a moment while she looked at me . Then she turned away . " See what I mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for an ice cream . She barely touched her cone ; I left her a block from her house with it dripping down around her fist . <p> That , as far as I knew , was the last time she ate . <p> On Day Eight in Earth Science Gabriel was napping in the last row when the two AV drones , twin brothers with twin eyeglasses , wheeled in the TV and VCR . Gabriel 's head lay sideways on his arms , a mass of soft black curls . As soon as the video started he jerked his head up and wiped the back of his hand across his lips . It was a film about cellular mitosis . When they showed a rabbit being inseminated and then dissected , he leapt to his feet . <p> " You mean they killed it ? " he cried . " What is this , Mr. Bergman , some kind of bunny snuff film ? " <p> " Gabriel , " I said . I was always tempted to stop there , at just the recitation of his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmed by his name being spoken aloud , just the way others are diminished . It was like food to him , and I did n't like seeing him fed in my class . <p> I stopped the film . " Gabriel , the term is sacrifice , not kill . We 've been over this . " <p> " Kill is kill , Mr. Bergman , " he said . " Dead is dead . " <p> " This is about life beginning , " I said . " I really think that if you 'd just sit down and watch you 'd be interested . " <p> " I do n't know , " he said doubtfully . " There 's the whole eye-for-an-eye thing ... " <p> " Sit down , Gabriel . " <p> Gabriel sat down , somehow larger and more beautiful than before . I started the film . When the egg finally divided  --  the chromosomes cleaving and rushing to their opposite pales  --  the class twisted in their seats to look back at him . He was asleep , his head on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Pearl , " I told her that night at her kitchen table , " you 're crossing the line . I do n't know what else to say to you . Think of Tess of the Whatshernames , think of Sister Goddamn Carrie . " <p> But it was too late ; just then I realized that she had already gone through with it . She was glowing but trying to hide it . <p> " Wrong sex , to begin with , " she said . She fingered her strand of faux pearls , her trademark . She did n't realize the pearls rode too far up the nape of her neck and emphasized her slightly hunched shoulders and sallow coloring . I had told her once that she reminded me of Garbo , but not the reason why . <p> " Let me show you something , " she said . " You are n't going to believe this . " She crossed her yellow kitchen and brought back a tin canister . Inside was white sugar , polluted with what looked to be tiny brown crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toast  --  covered with butter , covered with sugar . Can you believe it ? " She licked her finger and poked it into the canister . She held it up in front of her , coated . " Not a single cavity in his entire head . Teeth of steel . " After a moment she wiped the finger on the tablecloth . <p> " Lydia Martinez fainted in Kaplan 's class , " I said in a calm voice . <p> She stood up quickly and ran water over her hands . " I 'm not going to feel guilty . It has nothing to do with me . " She rubbed her hands on a dishtowel . <p> " I had a dream she was dead . I mean a nightmare . I have n't slept since . " <p> " You told me this already . " <p> " I called her house . Her parents pretended not to understand English . They put her little brother on , and he called me a whore lover and hung up . " <p> She examined her pearls absently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say who you were ? " <p> " When she came to , she asked them what day it was . Kaplan told her Tuesday . He did n't know what she meant . " <p> " God , would you listen to yourself , " she said . " Why do n't you just admit how badly you want to sleep with the girl and get it over with ? " <p> My hand gripped the tablecloth . " Do n't make fun of me . " <p> " Jesus , " she said . " I did n't say you had to do it . I just said that you should admit it . It would be good for you . " <p> I stood up . The tablecloth was crumpled where I had grasped it . " You 're not exactly the expert on what would be good for me , are you ? " <p> Pearl rolled her eyes . " Then why did you come over here ? To show me what a tough time you 're having ? " <p> " To help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked up her sugar canister and dumped it on the table . " Maybe it was so you could tell me the fascinating sugar anecdote . Got any spiral notebooks to show me ? Gym socks to hold under my nose ? " <p> She said something , but I was already moving toward the door . The screen slapped shut behind me , followed quickly by the slam of the interior door . <p> I drove past Lydia 's house on the way home . <p> By Day Eleven Lydia did n't seem thin as much as translucent . Her skin was mother-of-pearl . Her face was serenity itself : her glance at the wall clock , her gaze at the classroom door , her entire aspect , watching me , serenity . I explained quantum theory to the class the way it had been explained to me . I understood the loathing in their eyes . <p> After class I locked the door and turned out the lights . The feeble afternoon sunlight that slanted through the window seemed deadened by the looming blackboards . I sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bones of Lydia 's hand . <p> " Did you understand that ? " I asked . " Do I make any sense ? " <p> " No , " she said . " It 's kind of like Mass , except without God , without any feelings . " <p> I put pressure on her hand . " Lydia , you 're losing muscle by now . You 're losing calcium . Look at the periodic table . That 's not just rocks and metal , that 's you . " <p> " Jesus fasted for forty days and forty nights . " <p> I shook my head . " If he really did that he was just looking to make a big splash . " I could feel her tiny Catholic pulse quicken in the back of her hand . <p> " Have you ever fasted ? " she asked . <p> " No . " <p> " It reminds you that we 're all just tubes , you know . In and out . I know that sounds disgusting , but it 's funny ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it usually does . Everything seems so clean . " <p> " It 's an illusion , " I said . " I can explain the chemistry behind it . " <p> " I know you can , but not now , okay ? " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> " It 's like this , " she said . " I lived for Gabriel and now he 's gone . Why should I keep going if what I lived for is gone ? " <p> I lifted my hand . " You say that because you like the way it sounds . " <p> " You see ? " she said . " I try to tell you but you do n't believe me . " Then she took my hand back and her grip was strong . " It 's not that I want to think about him ; I do n't want to think about him . I just want someone to think about me . " She raised her hand and put the ends of my fingers against her lips . My arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she whispered , " you could make me want to stop . " I could feel the breath from each syllable on my fingertips . " Why do n't you just make me ? " <p> " I dreamt that you died , " I said . " I have n't slept since . Is n't that enough ? " <p> But it was n't . She sighed her disappointed sigh and looked at the clock above the door . She stood up , dropping my hand . I stood up to follow her but she was already gone ; after all , it was Friday afternoon and the week was over for the likes of me . <p> That night on the phone Pearl spoke with the kitchen tap running in the background . <p> " What is this ? " I said . " It sounds like you 're being gassed . " <p> She laughed too loudly . " What a clever thing to say . You 're such a wit . " <p> " He 's there , is n't he ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where is he , on the couch ? " <p> " No . Guess again . " <p> " I do n't have to guess again . He 's on the couch , watching television . You 're pretending to like it . ' What is this show about ? ' you ask him . ' Now , who is he , I forget who she is . ' You ask him every five seconds if he wants something to drink . You make the mistake of talking during some murder or explosion and he tells you to fuck off why do n't you . " <p> The water rushed louder . " You listen to me , " she said . <p> I waited , but all I heard was the water . " I 'm listening . " <p> " Be quiet a second . " Her hand went over the receiver . When the water noise came back I could hear her breath . <p> " I have to go , " she whispered . <p> Before I could answer the water stopped . Pearl 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you on Monday . I 'll be sure to bring that book . " <p> " Fuck , " I yelled into the mouthpiece . " Fuck ! " It was loud enough for him to hear ; loud enough if she had n't covered the earpiece on the way to the cradle . <p> Earth Science , bonehead science , science for simpletons . Monday , Day Fourteen , and Gabriel sat in the front row . He yawned twice ; once for real and once for me . He was n't wearing socks . He had a seventeen-year-old 's silly weekend peach-fuzz beard . He scratched himself . The girl in the next seat watched him with sad but hopeful virginity . <p> " What I want to know , Mr. Bergman , " Gabriel said , " is why animals do n't like intercourse . They always scream . " <p> Titters . " Gabriel . . " <p> " Cats act like they 're being killed . " <p> " I do n't know that that 's true . " <p> " It is . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " More titters . " No , seriously , they do . " <p> I tried a stern tone . " We 're not talking about reproduction anymore , Gabriel . That was last week . Pay attention . " <p> " I want to review . I did n't get it all the first time . " <p> I sighed and tried levity , " Neither did I , Gabriel , but life goes on . " <p> " Mr. Bergman , " he said . " Good one . " <p> " Who knows what phloem is ? " I asked , over his head . <p> Gabriel cleared his throat noisily , and the class laughed out loud at this one . But he was through . He was , after all , exhausted . <p> Fifty minutes later Pearl stood in the teachers ' lounge swirling coffee in a stained styrofoam cup . There were no stirrers ; there had n't been for weeks . I usually used a Bic . <p> " Your young man is practically passed out , " I said . " Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . " Stop , " she said . " It 's not even ten o'clock , Chris . Give me a morning 's peace , why do n't you ? " <p> "  --  is in the nurse 's office . She fainted in Kaplan 's class again . He 's beside himself . I heard him on the phone to his wife ; I think he was crying . " <p> " He 's manic-depressive , for Christ 's sake . The man weeps when the cafeteria runs out of Tater Tots . " <p> " What about your job ? " I said . " What about your career ? " <p> " God , " she said . " If you had any kind of heart . " <p> " We had this conversation , remember ? Everyone 's not like you two , you know . " <p> Her mouth wrinkled . " Oh , yes , I forgot . The chaste virgin . You would n't believe the things Gabriel says he 's done with her . " <p> " I 'm not interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sudden ? " She put her coffee down and closed her eyes for a second . " Look , I 'm sorry , but you started it . " <p> " I told you I have n't been sleeping . I 'm starting to see flashing lights out of the comers of my eyes . Whispering voices . I have n't had that since college . " <p> Her eyes flickered with concern , but just barely . " No sleep for two weeks ? " <p> " I do n't have the dreams , at least , but I still ca n't sleep . " <p> " Is this about me ? Chris , I gave you chances . I gave you chances until I could n't give anymore . " <p> " I do n't need chances , " I said . " I 've got more chances than I can cope with right now . " <p> Just then the vice-principal stepped in through the door . We stared at him . He wrinkled his nose and stepped back out . The vice-principal got his coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to use the teachers ' bathroom or wanted to locate the two of us , establish our whereabouts . The expression on his face fit either scenario . <p> We waited for fifteen seconds , picked up our briefcases , and left in opposite directions for second period . <p> The vice-principal had been hired the previous fall . Before he arrived there had been both a vice-principal and a dean of students . Soon afterward they canned the dean of students and gave his duties to the new vice-principal . It was obvious that he considered this some kind of promotion and not a screwing like the rest of us did , so from then on everyone figured him to be either an idiot or a zealous bureaucrat and avoided him altogether . The whole thing ended up making him bitter and suspicious and awfully good at his job . <p> The vice-principal 's office walls were lined with books that he had swiped from the library ; they still had the cellophane sleeves with decimal codes typed on white strips across he bottoms of the spines . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it had a leather satchel handle sewn onto the laces . He had been a coach of some kind at his last school and this was a gift from his players , young men who had apparently adored him . The students at our school were constantly stealing it . When they were n't stealing his football with the handle they were writing his name on the paper bottoms of butter pats along with an obscenity and tossing them up to the ceiling of the cafeteria , where they would stick . Every once in a while , without warning , one dropped , like a dead thing , into someone 's food . <p> " Mr. Bergman , " he said , leaning back in his gray vinyl chair . " We have a couple of situations . At least two that I know about . " <p> " Two , " I said , nodding . This set off the little flashing lights in the periphery of my vision . <p> " We have an emotionally unbalanced student on our hands and , I believe , a troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teacher , " I said . <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " We have teaching certificates , not instructing certificates . I 'm not a lifeguard . " <p> " Yes , I 'm aware that you 're not . I wonder if  --  " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said quickly . " I have n't been sleeping . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " He had leaned forward in his chair . <p> " I do n't sleep . It 's as simple as that . Please continue with what you were saying . " <p> " Fine . I thought I should tell you that the Superintendent of Schools has been enquiring about Lydia Martinez . " He said that , the bastard : enquiring . <p> " Well , when she dies he 'll probably stop enquiring . Not right away , but eventually . " <p> " You 're close to her , " he said without a beat . " She 's in your sixth period . " His face showed no hint of accusation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to shoot myself in the foot . Is n't that a term you people use ? Shoot yourself in the foot ? " <p> " Not really , " he said calmly . " I want you to get your girlfriend to talk to her , that 's all . " He picked up his football , not by the handle but by one blunt end , as if he were fondling a breast . The late afternoon sun suddenly appeared through the window behind him , and I had to lean a bit to the side to avoid getting it full in the face . It struck the vice-principal halfway through the back of his head ; his face darkened and his right ear glowed red around the edges <p> " To think , " he said , staring at his football . " We give them films about VD , about HIV , but we do n't mention this danger at all . " <p> " What danger ? " He was trying to confuse me ; I knew it . <p> " Tragic , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block out the sun . " All right , " I said . " What do you want her to say ? " <p> He looked up at me . There was no triumph in his expression " Frankly , I do n't know . " <p> " Then what would satisfy you ! " <p> " Calories , " he said . " An orange , a pear . A carrot stick . The goddamn Apple Brown Betty would do , but I do n't recommend it . " He smiled at his own joke . He was smart , though , I had to give that to him . She would probably listen to Pearl ; more than anyone else , she would listen to Pearl . <p> " Okay , " I said . It sounded inadequate , but I was tired from not sleeping . <p> " Good , " he said . " Kaplan will be happier . " <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> He flashed an innocent smile . " Our troubled teacher . I have a feeling this will perk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned . You 're priceless , I thought . Still , long after we 're gone you 'll be here . I started to get up to leave , but I sat back down . " Before I go , " I said , " what danger were you referring to ? " <p> " Oh , I thought it was obvious . " He put the football back on its stand . " Mental illness . " He tapped his forehead as emphasis . <p> " She 's not mentally ill . She actually has a point if you listen to her . " <p> " I was n't referring to her . She 'll come around . It 's all for the attention , I 'm sure . " He looked at my face and smiled . " Kaplan , " he said , " of course . " <p> " Of course , " I repeated . I left him there in his little slant of sunlight , behind his football . <p> " Fuck him , " Pearl said , back in the teachers ' lounge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right thing to do , " I said . " You owe it to her . " <p> " You need help , Chris . You need real help . Have n't you been paying attention to what 's going on here ? " <p> " Do n't start . This is n't about me . " <p> " No , of course not , " she said . " Never about you . " <p> " I told him you 'd do it . I think he suspects something with you and Gabriel . " <p> " Jesus , " she said . " Did you bother to ask him why he had to involve you , then ? Did n't you wonder about that ? " <p> " Look , like it or not he 's actually right . All you have to do is talk to her . She 'll listen to you . " <p> " God , " she said . She closed her eyes and shook her head . " This is something that should be begged . " <p> My heart pounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing you the favor . I covered for you . " <p> When Pearl opened her eyes she looked at me calmly . " If I talk to her , I tell her everything , " she said . " Tell her anything , " I said . " Tell her I have no heart . Tell her I beat you . Tell her the truth if you have to . Tell her whatever it was you told yourself . Just talk to her . This is me begging . " <p> She sighed and looked out the dirty window . " Where and when ? " she said . " Let 's get it over with . " <p> Pearl sat in the driver 's seat . Lydia sat in the passenger 's . I watched them from the bleachers of the varsity diamond as the sun went down behind me . When they were done Pearl drove off and Lydia stood alone under the trees by right field . It had gotten dark fast and the streetlight were already coming on . She stood for a few moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel scraped out , " she said . Her glance was feathery ; she was fighting hard to concentrate . I wondered if she saw the flashing lights like I did . <p> " Is she always like that ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , " I said . " But maybe not so much anymore . " <p> She sat for a moment . " She told me to tell you something , I do n't know if I should . " <p> I shook my head . " I want to know what she told you . " <p> " She told me to tell you this first . " <p> " All right . If you want to . " <p> " She said to tell you that she does n't feel sorry for you anymore . " <p> " She 's smart , " I said . Some white flashes went off and I had to close my eyes for a second . <p> " Everyone says you two used to be in love . Were you in love with her ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she say ? " <p> " Is it true I got you in trouble ? You might lose your job ? " <p> I almost laughed . I could have made that up myself . " Maybe , " I said . <p> " And everything would be okay if I just ate ? " <p> " Yes , it would . " I was lying so quickly now , so easily ; lying to impress a seventeen-year-old girl . Her martyr , her hero . <p> " I did n't want to hurt anybody , " she said . <p> " Lydia , I need to know , " I said . " Did she say anything else ? " <p> Her lips went tight . " She said that she 's never going to give him up . " <p> The flashing lights again . " Anything else ? " <p> " She said I should help you and be with you . That it 's important . " <p> My heart sank . Oh , Pearl . Then the streetlight behind me came on , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could finally see it , the whole of it . Her skin glowed ; I wanted to touch it with the back of my fingers . I did . <p> " Lydia , " I said . " You remember what you said to me before , about making you ? I could do that . I could just make you . " <p> But then that familiar resigned look crept in , very adult on her seventeen-year-old face , and I was suddenly afraid that I might be too late . <p> " It sounds all right now , " she said , " but what about in a couple of days ? You might feel different . " <p> " I wo n't , " I said . " I wo n't ever feel different . " <p> She looked away , moving her face in front of the street lamp . Blocked now , it scattered its light into the air surrounding her head . <p> " But I might , you see ? " she said . She turned back to me . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start eating again , " she said . " I might start eating and then it would all seem bad and I 'd never want to see you again . " <p> Then for God 's sake , do n't eat , I wanted to say . I 'd rather you disappeared . I 'd rather the earth opened and swallowed you whole . I 'd rather you were dead . <p> " What would you do then ? " she asked , her eyes suddenly bright and sharp and piercing . She took my hand and squeezed my fingers hard , down near the ends . " What would you do if that happened ? " <p> " What would I do if that happened ? " I repeated . I sat for a second . " That 's not what 's important , " I said . " What 's most important is that you eat and get better .
