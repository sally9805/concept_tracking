Tuesday , September 7th , 2010 , 11:24 p.m . Washington , D.C. " Okay , Commander , " Boyle said . " We 're clear . " Steve Day stepped out into the muggy autumn night from the cooler air-conditioned restaurant , surrounded still by the wonderful odors of exquisite Italian cooking . Already on the sidewalk , Boyle , Day 's chief bodyguard , spoke into his link . The limo was there , but Boyle was a very careful young man , one of the FBI 's finest . Only after he spoke did the limo 's electrically locked rear door click open . The whole time , Boyle looked everywhere but at Day . Day nodded at the driver , the new guy . Larry ? Lou ? Something like that . As he slid across the cloned-leather seat , he was feeling pretty good . Nothing like a seven-course meal and three kinds of excellent wine to put a man in a good mood . Umberto 's was new , but it was at least a four-star eateryor would be as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would n't be anytime soon . It never failed . As soon as he found a new out-of-the-way place with decent food , it was quickly " discovered " and reservations were impossible to get . True , he was the Commander of the recently established Net Force , still the flavor of the month in Washington power circles , but that did n't cut much ice when rich Senators or even richer foreign diplomats were in line ahead of you . Even restaurant owners in this town knew which backsides to kiss first , and top of the list sure was n't a political appointee as far down the food chain as Day was . For now , anyway . Still , the meal had been great : al dente pasta and artery-clogging sauce and shrimp , and salad and palate-cleansing ices . Day was both pleasantly full and slightly tipsy . Good thing he did n't have to drive . His virgil cheeped at him . Boyle slid in next to Day , closed the door , then tapped on the bullet-proof Lexan partition with one knuckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his belt and looked at it . His Virtual Global Interface Linkvirgil for shorthad a flashing telephone icon in the upper right corner of the small LCD screen . He touched the icon and a number blinked onto the screen . Marilyn , calling from home . He looked at the timesig . Just after eleven . She must have gotten back from her DAR meeting early . Those gab sessions usually ran past midnight . He grinned , tapped the phone number twice and waited for the connection . Not much bigger than a pack of cigaretteshe 'd given those up twenty years ago , but he had n't forgotten how big a pack wasthe virgil was a terrific toy . It was a computer , a GPS unit , phone , clock , radio , TV , modem , credit card , camera , scanner and even a little weavewire fax , all in one . The GPS could tell you where you were anywhere on the planetand because he was a ranking FBI officer , it did n't have the fudge-factor that commercial civilian units came with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could link to anybody with a phone or computer , via a scrambled hyperdigital channel so dense they called it a pipe and that would take an expert codebreaker a month of Sundays to tap into . This particular unit would , with the proper code , allow Day to access the FBI and Net Force mainframe DNAs , with their vast information stores . Had he been so inclined , Day could have grabbed a pinch of the powdered sugar that came on the cheesecake he 'd had for dessert , dusted a fingerprint left on a plate by his waiter and had it checked , ID 'd , and a full history on the man back to him before he 'd finished eating . It was great living here in the future , a mere decade after the turn of the century . If 2010 had such wonders , what might it look like in another twenty or thirty years ? He was looking forward to finding out , and with advances in medicine , he could pretty much expect to do so . The virgil 's speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marilyn . What 's up ? " " Nothing much . We got done early . I was just wondering if you might want a late supper . " He grinned at the virgil . He did n't have his camera on , so she could n't see the smile . " I just left Umberto 's , " he said . " I think I 'll pass on eating for the next couple of weeks . " She laughed . " I understand . You coming home ? " " On the way . " He had a condo in the city , but most nights he tried to get across the river and to the house . The kids were grown , but Marilyn and the dog still liked to see him now and again . He tapped the virgil and re-clipped it to his belt , which needed a little attention . He loosened the buckle a couple of holes and slid the Galco paddle holster with his SIG .40 around toward the front a little so it would n't dig into his right hip . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to-be better than a gun , but he did n't really trust them . Yes , he was a political appointee for the current job , but he 'd been in the field a long time to earn the spot . He trusted his old-fashioned pistol . Moving the gun helped . While he was at it , he undid the Velcro on his Kevlar vest 's side panels and re-tabbed them a little looser , too . Next to him , Boyle fought to keep his grin under control . Day shook his head . " Easy for you to laugh . You 're whatthirty ? Still bulking up at the gym three or four times a week , right ? Us fat old desk jockeys do n't have time to stay in shape . " Not that he was that much out of shape . Five-eight , maybe 190 ? He could drop a few pounds , but hey , he was fifty-two last June and he was entitled to carry a little extra baggage . He 'd earned it . They were on the narrow street behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a dark and dreary part of town , with streetlights broken out and dead , stripped cars lining the road . Another of the instant slums , going down fast even before the original paint had dried . In his opinion , the current welfare philosophy needed major work ; of course , it always had . Though things were getting better , the future still had a way to go to pick up all of its passengers . There were streets in D.C. he would n't walk alone after dark ; gun , vest , and virgil notwithstanding . An armored limo made him feel a little more secure There came a terrific bang , a flash that strobed the limo 's interior a sudden bright orange . The car rocked up on the driver 's side , hung for what seemed like forever on two wheels , then fell back and hit the street hard . " What the hell ? " Boyle already had his pistol out as the limo fishtailed , slewed and slammed into a streetlight post . The post was fiberglass . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spraying shattered glass in a tinkly rain upon the car 's trunk . Day saw a bulky man in black run toward the car from out of the sticky night . The man wore a watch cap pulled low but not covering his face . He had blond hair , a scar running through his right eyebrow . He was smiling . Day thought he caught a flash of movement at the rear of the limo , but when he looked , he did n't see anything . " Go ! " Boyle yelled . " Go , go ! " The driver tried . The engine roared , the wheels screeched , but the car did n't move . The stench of burning rubber filled the car . Day thumbed the emergency scramble button on the virgil , and was already reaching for his own pistol when the man in black reached the limo and slapped something on the door . Whatever it was thunked metallically . The man turned and sprinted away , back into the darkness " Out ! " Boyle screamed . " He 's stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the door handle on the driver 's side , jerked it up , dove out and hit the ground in a sloppy shoulder roll . There came the repetitive bark of a submachine gun , followed by the spang ! spang ! spang ! of jacketed teeth chewing at the wounded limo . Day rolled again , looking for cover . Nothing . Nowhere to hide ! He glanced back at the car . Saw and felt time become mired in heaviness . Boyle exited the car , gun working , tongues of orange fire stabbing into the dark , but it was like a slow-motion scene in a movie . Boyle jerked as the small-arms fire beat at him , slammed into his torso . In a small corner of his mind , Day knew that most submachine guns used pistol ammunition and that the vests he and Boyle both wore would stop any handgun round . As long as they did n't blood and brain matter sprayed from the side of Boyle 's temple as a bullet exited there as long as they did n't think to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on ? Who were these people ? In the limo , the driver kept trying to pull away , the roar of the engine continuing . Day could smell the exhaust , the burned tireshe could smell his own fear , too , sharp , sour , overwhelming . The mine attached to the rear door of the limo went offblam ! All the glass in the limo blew out . It sleeted in all directionssome of it hit Day , but he was only dimly aware of it touching him . The car 's roof peeled " up a little in the back , leaving a fist-sized gap . Smoke , bitter and acrid , washed over him in a hot wave . The driver hung partway out of his window , boneless . Dead . The driver and Boyle were both dead . Help would be coming , but he could n't wait for itif he did , he would be dead , too . Day came up , took two or three quick steps , jinked right for two more steps , then cut left . Broken-field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five years ago . Gunfire tried to catch him , but failed to connect solidly . A bullet tugged at his jacket , punched through under his left arm . He felt a sense of outrage . The goddamned jacket was Hong Kong silk , it had cost him six hundred dollars ! Another round smashed into his chest , right over the heart . He 'd never worn the titanium trauma plate , had just used a trifold of Kevlar stuffed down in the trauma pocket over the heart like a lot of agents did , and the impact hurt like a bastard ! Like he 'd been hit with a hammer , right on the sternum ! Damn ! But it did n't matter . He was up , he was moving A black figure appeared in front of him , waving a flashing Uzi . Even in the night and murk of his fear , Day saw the man wore bulky combat armor under his black jacket . Day had been taught to shoot to the center of mass first , but that would n't do now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacker that way any more than the Uzi 's 9mm 's were hurting him ! Still running , Day lifted the SIG , lined the glowing tritium dot of the front sight on the man 's nose . Day 's vision tunneledall he could see was the face . The green night-sight dot bounced around , but he squeezed off three shots as fast as he could pull the trigger . The armored attacker dropped as if his legs had vanished . All right ! All right ! He had taken one of them out , he had created a hole , it was just like in football when he 'd been the quarterback so long ago . Now , go through the hole , fast , head for the goal line ! He caught motion peripherally , glanced to his left , and saw another man , also in black . The man held a pistol in two hands . He was as still as a painting . He looked as if he were at the range , ready to practice . Day felt his bowels clench . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same instant . Whoever these guys were , they were professionals . This was n't any street gang looking for somebody 's wallet . This was a hit , an assassination , and they were good It was his final thought . The bullet hit him between the eyes and took away everything else he might ever think . In the backseat of the Volvo station wagon , Mikhayl Ruzhy looked into the cargo compartment behind him at the body of Nicholas Papirsa . The body lay on its side , covered with a blanket , and the smell of death seeped into the air despite the covering . Ruzhy sighed , shook his head . Poor Nicholas . It had been hoped there would be no casualtiesit was always hoped to be sobut the fat American had not been as old and slow as expected . They had underestimated himan error . Of course , it had been Nicholas who had been responsible for the intelligence about the FBI Commander , so perhaps it was fitting that he was the only casualty . Still , Ruzhy would miss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in the Foreign Intelligence Service , the SRV . Fifteen years . A lifetime in this business . Tomorrow would have been Nicholas 's birthday ; he would have been forty-two . In the front seat , Winters , the American , drove , and Grigory Zmey rode in the passenger seat , mumbling to himself in Russian . Their last nameseven Winterswere not those bestowed upon them by their fathers . They were jokes . Ruzhy meant " rifle . " Nicholas had named himself " cigarette . " Grigory called himself after the Russian word for " snake . " Ruzhy sighed again . Done was done . Nicholas was dead , but so was the target . The loss was therefore acceptable . " You doin ' okay back there , hoss ? " the American said . " I am fine . " " Just checkin ' . " The American had said he was from Texas , and either he was or his accent was a passable fake . Ruzhy looked down at the pistol on the seat next to him , the one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a Beretta 9mm , an Italian weapon . It was a fine piece of machinery , well made , but it was also big , heavy , with too much recoil , too much noise , too much bullet for Ruzhy 's taste . When he had been spetsnaz and involved in mokrie delawet affairshe had carried a little PSM , a 5.45mm pistol . The round it fired had been perhaps half as large as those in the Italian gun , and the weapon itself was much smaller than this piece . True , he 'd had the armorer tune it for him ; but still , it had always been sufficient to do the job . It had never let him down . He would have preferred that weapon to this one , but of course , that would not do . This had to look as if the killing was by someone inside this country , and a Russian assassin 's weapon would ring enough alarms to raise the dead man . The Americans were not altogether stupid in these matters . He frowned at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to them , bigger was always better . Their policemen would sometimes empty handguns containing eighteen or twenty high-powered and large-caliber rounds at their criminals , missing each time , what they called " spray-and-pray . " They did not seem to understand that a single shot from a small-caliber weapon in the hands of an expert was much more effective than a magazine full of elephant-killing bullets in the hands of an untrained idiotas many of the American policemen seemed to be . The Jews knew this . The Israeli Mossad still routinely carried .22 's , weapons that fired the smallest commercially available rounds . And everybody knew Mossad was not to be taken lightly . But at least the FBI man had died well . He had taken one of them with him and that had been unexpected . He had hit Nicholas three times in the head . Once might have been an accident ; thrice , certainly by intent . He had seen the body armor , known what it was , shot for the head . Had he been a bit faster , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front seat , the Snake muttered something , loud enough for Ruzhy to hear . He gritted his teeth . Ruzhy did not like Grigory the Snake . The man had been in the army in 1995 , one of the units that had stomped into Ruzhy 's homeland of Chechnya to kill and rape . Yes , yes , Grigory had been a soldier , just following his orders , and yes , this mission was more important in the long run than any grudges Ruzhy might have against the Snake , so he would endure the man . But perhaps one of these days , the Snake would speak of his beautiful Medal for Action in Chechnya once too often , and if that day came near enough to the end of the mission so he would not be vital , Grigory Zmey would go to join his ancestors . And Ruzhy would smile while he throttled the stupid oaf . Not today , however . There was still much to be done , bridges to be crossed , objectives to be achieved , and the Snake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michaels was only half asleep when the small monitor on the nightstand next to his bed lit . He felt the pressure of the light against his closed lids , and rolled toward the source and opened his eyes . The screen 's blue Net Force background came up and the computer 's vox said , " Alex ? We have a priority-one com . " Michaels blinked , and frowned at the timesig on the monitor 's upper right corner . Just past midnight . He was n't awake . What ? " Alex ? We have a priority-one com . " The computer 's voice was throaty , sexy , feminine . No matter what it said , it always sounded as if it were asking you to go to bed with it . The personality module , including the vox program , had been programmed by Jay Gridley , and the voice he 'd chosen for it was , Michaels knew , a joke . Jay was a great tech , but a better cook than he was a comedian , and while Michaels found the vox irritating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of asking him to change it . The Deputy Commander of Net Force rubbed at his face , combed his short hair back with his fingers , and sat up . The small motion-sensitive cam mounted on the top of the monitor tracked him . The unit was programmed to send visuals unless he told it otherwise . " All right , I 'm up . Connect com . " The **26;416;TOOLONG obeyed his command . The screen flowered , and the somewhat-harried face of Assistant Deputy Commander Antonella Fiorella appeared . She looked more alert than he felt , but then she had the graveyard watch this week , so she was supposed to be alert . " Sorry to wake you , Alex . " " No problem , Toni . What 's up ? " She would n't be calling him if it was n't vital . " Somebody just assassinated Commander Day . " " What ! ? " " His virgil sent out an alert . D.C. PD rolled on it . Time anybody got there , Day , his bodyguard Boyle and the limo driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submachine guns , looks like . Maybe twenty minutes ago . " Michaels said a word he seldom used in mixed company . " Yeah , " Toni said . " And the horse it rode in on , too . " " I 'm on my way . " " Virgil 's got the address . " A short pause . " Alex ? Do n't forget the assassination protocols . " She did n't need to remind him of that , but he nodded . In the event of an attack on a senior federal official , all members of that unit had to assume it might not be the only attack planned . " I copy that . Discom . " His assistant 's image vanished , leaving the Net Force blue screen . He slid off the bed and started pulling on his clothes . Steve Day was dead ? Damn . Damn .
