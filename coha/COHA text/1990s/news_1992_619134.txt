<p> Propelled by an explosion in small-company stocks , San Francisco 's investment banking community roared out of a three-year slump last year to post record or near-record revenues and profits . <p> Investment bankers , who even in lean years tend to speak optimistically , had to stretch their lexicon to describe 1991 . <p> " If you had to grade the year , it was a 10 , " said Sandy Robertson , a partner with Robertson , Stephens &; Co . " It was a blowout year . We had a record top and bottom line , a record amount of money under management , a record in the way our underwritings responded in the marketplace . It was a real vintage year . " <p> Bill Welty , a partner with Volpe , Welty &; Co. , described it as a " wonderful , serendipitous year . " But for most securities firms , he said , it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time . <p> " We were in a huge bull market , " Welty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Thomas Weisel , chairman and chief executive of Montgomery Securities , said 1991 " was a record in terms of sales and profitability , by a wide margin . " <p> After hovering around $ 100 million for the four previous years , Montgomery 's revenues in 1991 surged to about $ 170 million . The privately held company wo n't reveal income , but Weisel said " earnings growth kept pace " with revenues . <p> Just about the only part of Montgomery 's business that has n't taken off is its plan  --  announced with much fanfare in November  --  to sell U.S. stocks to Russian citizens . " I do n't think we 've done a single transaction yet , " Weisel said . <p> For the first time since the 1987 stock market crash , almost every aspect of the securities business flourished last year : <p> * The stock market soared . The Standard &; Poor 's 500 index of large-capitalization stocks was up 26.3 percent , while the Nasdaq composite index of smaller- company stocks posted a stunning 56.8 percent gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares traded on the New York and American exchanges and on Nasdaq hit 90 billion shares compared to 76 billion in 1990  --  an 18 percent increase . <p> * Underwriting volumes surged . Last year , 812 companies issued a record $ 45.6 billion in stock , according to IDD Information Services . That compares to 362 companies and $ 13.6 billion in 1990 . ( All underwriting figures exclude closed- end funds . ) <p> The only segment that fared poorly in 1990 was mergers and acquisitions , which was never a big activity for Bay Area investment banks . Although the local firms did n't reap the profits of the 1980s merger craze , neither did they suffer the consequences of its near-collapse . <p> Although his firm did n't post a record last year , Gordon Macklin , co-CEO of Hambrecht &; Quist , said that local investment banks " did extraordinarily well versus the rest of the industry because for the most part , we are focused on emerging growth companies .

These deals raised a combined $ 6.1 billion . That 's up from just 44 offerings worth $ 1.8 billion the previous year . <p> Alex , Brown &; Sons , which is headquartered in Baltimore but has a sizable presence in San Francisco , did 75 deals worth $ 3.8 billion in 1991 , versus 42 offerings worth $ 1.5 billion in 1990 . <p> Smaller firms also saw big increases . Volpe , Welty did 13 deals worth 309 million , up from three deals worth $ 55 million the previous year . Sutro &; Co. did seven deals worth $ 489 million compared to a single , $ 19 million offering in 1990 , all according to IDD . <p> The small-cap craze also boosted Bay Area firms ' brokerage and money management activities , which tend to be less volatile than investment banking . <p> Montgomery 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth-best performance of any mutual fund in the nation , according to Lipper Analytical Services . It now has $ 78 million in assets . <p> Robertson , Stephens ' Emerging Growth Fund posted a 58 percent return and went from $ 20 million to $ 150 million in assets . <p> Despite the boom in business , Bay Area investment firms have been fairly restrained in adding staff . Montgomery and H &Q; increased their staffs by 7 percent and 5 percent , respectively . Robertson , which is smaller than the other two , boosted its staff by 22 percent . <p> All three firms intend to continue hiring selectively this year , although Montgomery plans to hire eight to 10 MBAs  --  twice its usual recruitment . <p> Most of the firms interviewed said they plan to use last year 's windfall profits to reward their best employees and to build capital . <p> None reported aggressive expansion plans , although Robertson recently opened a small Tokyo office to handle U.S.-Japanese mergers and acquisitions . <p> Montgomery will open a new emerging-markets fund that will invest around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information service dubbed " Market Max " to institutional investors . The $ 400-a- month service  --  offering immediate and historical data  --  will be the first of its kind available for Macintosh computers , Weisel said . <p> How San Francisco 's investment firms fare in 1992 depends largely on how long stocks  --  particularly small-cap growth stocks  --  remain alluring to investors . <p> Weisel , who expects another great year , points out that low inflation and slow economic growth  --  the scenario envisioned by many economists  --  act like fertilizer for small growth companies . He also argues that despite their huge run-up , small stocks are still underpriced by historical standards . <p> Welty is less somewhat less optimistic . " I feel pretty comfortable about the first half , for the standard , pretty stupid reason that alternative investments " such as real estate , commodities , and money market funds , look pretty bleak next to stocks . <p> But , he added , " I 'm worried about the second half .

" People think if it 's good now , it 'll be even better later . " <p> Taking the middle ground is H &Q's; Macklin . " It 's hard to fight the tape , " he said . " You look at the momentum in the market , and it 's almost foolish to say this is going to stop . " <p> But , he continued , " We also understand the markets are relatively expensive . And there are always a lot of uncertainties in the world . We 're not planning or counting on another 1991 , but there are a lot of ways it could happen .
