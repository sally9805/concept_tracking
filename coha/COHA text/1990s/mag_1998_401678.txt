// While it 's true that walking is as basic an exercise as they come , can putting one foot in front of the other help you lose weight ? According to one of the largest weight-loss studies ever , the answer is a resounding yes . In a recent issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , The National Weight Control Registry ( NWCR ) published its findings regarding individuals who have achieved successful , long-term weight loss . A whopping 94 percent of participants significantly increased physical activity ; the majority burned about 1,000 of the average 2,800 weekly exercise calories by walking them off ( at an average of 400 per workout ) . A regular walking program is good for your health in other ways , too . " Walking challenges your cardiovascular system and builds muscle endurance , " asserts Ellen Abbott , walking director of the Boston Athletic Club . " It 's also easy on your joints , so your risk of injury is minimal . " The Need for Speed If your goal is to get in serious shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What you need is a hard-core fitness walking program - one that gets your heart pumping well into its training range and leaves your brow dripping with sweat a minimum of twice a week . How do you turn something as simple as a stroll into a challenging workout ? " Easily , " Abbott contends . " Walk faster , throw in some faster walking sprints and add a few hills . " Even though it may take you longer to go the distance , one mile of walking burns about the same number of calories as one mile of running . And remember , the harder you hoof it , the more calories you blast . For example , walking at a comfortable 3 mph burns 70 calories in 20 minutes . But pick up the pace to 4.5 mph , and your 20-minute calorie burn jumps to 90 calories , a 20 percent increase . If you 're trying to slim down , consider sweating off about 400 calories in each trek for three to five days a week .
