<p> Mike Sullivan has started as an offensive lineman for Miami for four years . He has been in a losing locker room only four times . So there is no wonder he feels the way he does . <p> " No matter how you come in here , " he said , " you have to leave a perfectionist . Because that 's what everybody expects out of you . " <p> Ah , Miami . The school so many love to hate , and so few beat . Five defeats in five years for the defending national champion . And now , as a Mobil Cotton Bowl date with Texas nears , the Hurricanes have rebounded from a 4-2 start - the first time in six years they 've lost two regular-season games - to be in the hunt for another title . <p> Sullivan again , recalling the 29-20 loss to Notre Dame : " I thought the chance for No. 1 was dead , I thought I was dead , I thought the whole world was dead . Seeing that 4-2 record on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our way not to be average around this place . " <p> Average , they 're not . But it comes with a price . There is no room for error . <p> " Sometime the pressure is so great , " defensive tackle and Outland Trophy winner Russell Maryland said , " you just dread messing up . " <p> At Miami , pressure is an anonymous letter left in the dark of night . <p> Just ask coach Dennis Erickson . It had been a bad October weekend for Erickson . A devastating loss at Notre Dame , the long flight home , a fitful night of little sleep and then the drive to the office Sunday morning to begin picking up the pieces . <p> Under the office door was a letter . In the 13 hours since the end of the Notre Dame game , someone had slipped into a locked building , sought out Erickson 's office and left an opinion about the coach of the Miami Hurricanes . <p> It was unsigned . And ripping . <p> Letters in the Miami newspaper were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " one said , " does n't deserve to coach the UM football team . " <p> At the time , Erickson was 15-3 at Miami . <p> " I see why his hair is as gray as it is , " Sullivan said . " There is no hiding down here . " <p> Some things have changed about Miami in recent years . Academics have been stressed - all 17 seniors are graduating - and the taunting and dancing that seemed as natural with Miami as sunshine have been toned down . <p> But one thing has not changed : the demand for success . <p> And so Miami takes this dirty little 9-2 record into the Cotton Bowl Jan. 1 with a slight chance at back-to-back national titles . The Hurricanes need a big victory , help from other teams and sympathy from voters . <p> It is a near-impossible trifecta , but even finishing close would put Miami on a new pinnacle . A No. 2 spot in the polls would make it five consecutive years finishing first or second . No school has done that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the players are as demanding of themselves as the fans . " We put so much pressure on ourselves , " receiver Randal Hill said , " we ca n't feel anything from outside . " <p> Added Sullivan of the chase for No. 1 : " There is nothing we can do to politic . We do n't want to sit out there and cry and look for sympathy votes . We have a great opportunity , without opening our mouths , to prove we are one of the best teams in the land . " <p> There is much Miami has to make up for : The stunning 28-21 opening loss at BYU . The unimpressive 30-28 season-closing victory at San Diego State , which Erickson said " looked like a frigging sideshow . " <p> And the one that really hurt - the defeat at the hands of Notre Dame . <p> At the time , all seemed lost . <p> " Our ultimate goal is out of reach now , " safety Charles Pharms said that day . <p> " A lot of people worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little today , " Sullivan said at the time . <p> But defeats motivate . And time heals . The ' Canes have won five in a row since , building steam toward Jan. 1 . <p> " People were saying we were n't the team we used to be , " Maryland said . " That we were just a lot of trash-talkers . Our backs were against the wall . We had to salvage the season . " <p> Said Erickson : " Our goal was to play the next five games with a vengeance . That 's what we did . " <p> Erickson 's first year was a ride to the national championship . This year has been a tougher grind . He has lost 20 pounds . After the loss to BYU , he would wake up in cold sweats . He maintains he is happy in his job , that this season has been no harder than any other , and that 99.9% of the Miami people are positive . But the enormous expectations have to take their toll . <p> " The people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that call in call-in shows and rip you are a little goofy and touched in my opinion , " he said . " That stuff does n't bother me . I 'm not the only one . It happens to every coach in the country . <p> " People who think we 'll win the national championship every year are nuts . But to keep it at a level of teams coached by the Schembechlers and the Paternos , that 's realism . " <p> The players say they can see his ordeal . <p> " Mood swings , maybe being a little more uptight , " Pharms described his coach . " Sometimes , he just looked bad . You could tell something was wrong . It 's pitiful , it 's bad that it gets to that point . But it 's better now than it was earlier in the season . " <p> So Miami awaits Texas and hopes for the best in the polls . Some voters still do n't much like the ' Canes , though their recent behavior has been more orderly since their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We still sneak a little bit in , " said Pharms , who swears that the Hurricanes talk no more than many other teams . <p> " I can never remember the referees telling another team to stop talking . It 's always us . " <p> But others sling trash , he assured , with hallowed Notre Dame one of the most vocal . <p> " Even Rocket , " said cornerback Robert Bailey . <p> The mild-mannered Raghib Ismail ? <p> " Even Rocket , " Pharms agreed . <p> Sullivan is happy with a quieter team : " There 's a difference between showboating and showboating when you 're dominating your opponents . We might have been showboating before we were dominating our opponents . " <p> So what we see here is a maturing Miami team , maybe too late to be a champion , but not to be special . Even at No. 2 . <p> " For all we 've been through , " Pharms said , " I do n't think we could ask for more . " <p> " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the work ethic came around . We 're as guilty as anybody for reading our own press clippings in the beginning of the year . We were pretty high and mighty . I thought we 'd walk through the season undefeated . I stand here fully corrected . " <p> Corrected , but still pushing to be perfect . There are n't many places where a 10-2 season would be only accepted more than celebrated . The Hurricanes ask a lot of themselves . <p> " We 've become a victim of our own success , " Sullivan said . " But it 's what we like . It keeps us going .
