<p> AT Jewell and David Brain 's booth at the 1997 Atlantique City Holiday Fair , the talk was n't cheap . <p> " What 's Seymour running now ? " called one collector . <p> " Sixty-five , " said Mrs. Brain , a dealer from Stamford , Conn . <p> " I 'm looking for Curly , " another voice called from out of the crush . <p> " Who is n't ? " Mrs. Brain said , with a sharp laugh . <p> With 1,500 worldwide exhibitors , the fair , at the new Convention Center over the Oct. 18 weekend , was the largest indoor collectibles event ever staged . And Mr. and Mrs. Brain were the talk of it : their glass cases were filled with Beanie Babies , seven-inch-long , plush-covered **33;0;TOOLONG animals displayed like gems against black . Mrs. Brain sold a set of Bronty the Brontosaurus , Steg the Stegosaurus and Rex the Tyrannosaurus for $1,750 . She sold Peking the Panda for $1,295 . The biggest ticket : a $2,995 tag for Peanut the Elephant , in rare royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of blue-chip stocks . Meet a blue-chip elephant . <p> With a kind of viral cuteness , Beanie Babies have invaded the antiques world . At their oldest they are barely four . New Beanies are still being made by Ty Toys , which " retires " characters periodically , taking them out of production and creating scarcity . At their Atlantic City debut as antiques , there was sniggering division among dealers and collectors . Were Beanie Babies corrupting the collectibles market ? Or was it business as usual in a business accustomed to bride-and-groom Pez candy dispensers for $4,000 and up ? It depended on whom you asked  --  and what they had for sale . <p> " They 're dangerous , " said James Maley , a dealer from Fullerton , Calif . " That stuff is essentially new . People are paying  --  they 're hot  --  but that 's the kind of market that will crash . " <p> Mr. Maley had no Beanie Babies for sale , but he had sold a discontinued Snow White Pez dispenser that morning for $250 . " Pez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained carefully . <p> Dan Morphy , a dealer from the Adamstown Antique Gallery in Denver , Pa. , did have Beanie Babies for sale . But he was willing to play it both ways . " I guarantee those will be dead in a year , " he said . " I put money on it . " <p> Though they started life as a collectible toy for children , Beanie Babies are n't kid stuff anymore . The new collecting market for Beanie Babies is being driven by and for adults , often inspired by their children 's original collections . And the prices have matured accordingly . <p> " Seventy-five percent of my people are adults , " Mrs. Brain said . " They 're a category of ' I used to buy these for my kids to play with , now I buy them for my kids and they sit on a top shelf and they 're going to pay for college . ' " <p> Kelly Flagg , 14 , of Tappan , N.Y. , was visiting Mrs. Brain 's booth with her mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were introduced in 1993 . She buys duplicates to trade , some of which are now valuable enough to barter for big-ticket items like those she saw for sale at the Brains . Kelly is within 9 Beanies of a complete collection  --  135 pieces plus 10 variants on characters , like differing names or colors . <p> David Brain estimates such a collection would now be worth more than $40,000 , not including an added premium for completeness . <p> Once Kelly crosses the finish line she intends to sell the collection to buy a Corvette . <p> " As collectors got involved , the prices went off the Richter scale , " said her father , Warren Flagg . " My daughter 's close enough that it 's worth it to start paying . " Mr. Flagg added , " God forbid that in 1993 she actually played with them  --  she was 11 . " <p> Billy McLarnon , 7 , was there with his father , Bill , and RoseAnne DeSantes . <p> " Right now , we 're down to the nitty-gritty , " Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by plane  --  we 're real serious about this . We spent $800 on them just last week , and the week before . " <p> And people think the stock market is a wild ride . <p> " The speed with which the Beanies has happened is incredible  --  I 've never seen this happen in any other collectible market , " said Mr. Brain , who has had experience in traditional collectibles , like stamps and art glass . <p> Collectibles are now referred to as the " secondary market . " Why ? Because the manufacturers of the items being collected  --  the primary market  --  are still active in the field . <p> Ty Toy introduced Beanie Babies in 1993 as a toy to collect . At a $4.95 retail price , it was easy for children to do : the idea was to own them all . But Ty Toys conveniently introduces new characters to collect as it retires older ones . <p> The company has just lowered the limbo stick on collectors again  --  this time with availability . As of June , retailers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one order per month permitted . So there is always a Beanie down the road , and Ty is driving the market . <p> Ty Toy , a privately held 11-year old company in Oakbrook , Ill. , had estimated Beanie Baby sales of $26 million in 1996 . The company has said that 1997 figures are running 10 times higher than the previous year . <p> " He 's thrilled by the secondary market , " Anne Nickels , a company spokeswoman , said of Ty Warner , the company 's founder and the Beanies ' godfather , who would not be interviewed . " Even a rumor will create a flurry of buying . " <p> Joyce Washnik , the editor and publisher of Giftbeat , a trend-tracking newsletter for the gift industry , said : " Ty has been very smart in how he 's handled the retirements . It drives the line . Retailers are making a lot of money on this . " <p> " In 42 years of the gift business , I 've never seen anything like it , " said Paul Ungrodt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan and a catalogue business , Ideation , which distributes catalogues to 500 independent card and gift shops . " In five stores , we 've sold a half-million dollars of Beanies since January , at $4.99 a piece . " <p> Beanie Baby characters have appeared irregularly in some parts of the country but not others , agitating shortages and provoking hoarding and rumors of retirement when characters do n't show up in a shipment . <p> Ms. Washnik said that retailers have jumped into the crossover between the primary and secondary markets for Beanie Babies by charging prices well above the suggested retail ones for new or " current " characters , as collectors race to find them all . <p> TY TOY says the shortages are not deliberate , that the company was caught by surprise by the popularity of the Beanies , making production and shipping erratic . As of mid-October , Ty 's Official Beanie Baby Web site , where " retirements " are posted , had received over a billion " hits " or visits . Not unexpectedly , announced retirements also create a frenzied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> October " retirees " like Hoot the Owl and Teddy the Brown Bear are trading at $25 to $75 respectively , while a January 97 retiree like Tabasco the Bull is $145 . When rumors about imminent retirements sweep through the collecting community on the Web 's several dozen Beanie sites , the stampeding among collectors would make Tabasco feel right at home . <p> How did the toys spawn such a monstrous presence in two short years , like the cuddly Gremlins in the film that a child accidentally gets wet ? <p> Other companies have tried straddling the primary and secondary markets before , most successfully Swatch . The Swiss watch manufacturer , which introduced its rapidly changing , fashion-pulse product line of inexpensive watches in 1986 , subsumed its own collectors officially in 1990 with Swatch the Club , which has more than 120,000 members internationally . Now , Swatch can orchestrate collectors as well as sell to them , with limited-edition presale product announcements and sponsored events that generate incalculable amounts of publicity . <p> " Collectibility is good for business , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It creates a hype . When club members come to these events we arrange , they 're walking billboards . " <p> If collectors have traditionally defined what they do as the thrill of the hunt , Peanut the Elephant , his fellow Beanie Babies and his Web site friends make a strange sort of safari indeed . At Atlantic City , dealers and collectors were working the vast floor with walkie-talkies and cell phones , placing bids like Wall Street traders . <p> For her part , Jewell Brain has seen one irrefutable indicator of the market 's maturity . " I was in Alabama , driving down the highway , and I passed a pawnshop with a big sign : ' Beanies Are Here , ' " she said . " If a pawnshop will take Beanies , there 's real value there . " <p> Collecting has always been a matter of some speculation , but antiques at least were backed by a gold standard of workmanship , age and rarity . Now the currency  --  collectibles  --  is a floating one , subject to Dow-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine art , decorative art or jewelry , but popular culture  --  none of it has intrinsic value , " said Catherine Elkies , the head of collectibles for Christie 's , which helped establish the market for collectibles with sales of lunch boxes and animation cels for boomers , and Pez candy dispensers and Hot Wheels toy cars for newer , Gen-X collectors hitting the market with first-job professional salaries smoking their pockets . The last two categories climbed into thousands of dollars on the block ; like Beanie Babies , both are also currently manufactured . <p> " I 'm pretty blown away when some of these prices occur , " Ms. Elkies said . " The prices that come out of this market are staggering . " <p> Whether you 're 20-something or 40-something , " Memorabilia  --  it 's where the highest grossing auctions are , " said Paul Jenkins , a collectibles specialist with Christie 's . <p> " It 's people who have grown up with these types of items , " he added , " relating to them in a nostalgic way and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone agrees . Death can be sudden  --  and it 's final . <p> " Baseball cards in the 1980 's , " said James Maley , a California dealer . " I dealt in them ; they were super , super red-hot . All of a sudden , the companies overproduced them . People lost interest . Everybody tried to sell . There were no buyers . " <p> The near future may prove the stock market all too true a parallel . But for now , David Brain , the dealer , is still talking about the Beanie he 's never even seen : Nana the Monkey . <p> " It 's the rarest of the rare , " Mr. Brain said . " I know people who know people who have one . If you ever saw it , " he said , his voice oddly clear in the thin air of pure speculation , " you would see it sell easily  --  for $5,000 to $7,500 .
