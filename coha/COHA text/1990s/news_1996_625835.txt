<p> It is Sunday , and I am happy . I have just gone flying , where the clouds were so white against the blue Texas sky , and now I sit on my tiny living room floor among the pages of the paper , a cup of coffee within reach , and my sister 's beautiful singing voice filling up our apartment . Sundays are different for me now . <p> Up until only a couple of months ago , I lived with a husband and a dog in a South American country . On a day like today in Venezuela , I would have been wakened early by the sound of dog nails being pulled down the wooden bedroom door , and I would have risen , dressed , and left the sleeping husband to take the dog on his walk . I never slept past the toenails on the door , even on a Sunday , because , as the husband reasoned , Lizard was my dog . <p> On a day like today in Venezuela , Lizard and I would have sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waiting . I used to watch the clouds move across the sky , and pretend that I was flying instead of stuck to the ground , stuck in the progressively unhappy marriage , stuck spending my lonely days with a big , sad dog . <p> Eventually the husband would have gotten up , and readied his windsurfing equipment for his Sunday at the beach . I would have tried to convince him to take Lizard along , even though it would mean he would have to watch him , and play with him , and make sure he did n't scare anyone with his furry , human-size body and slobbery jowls . <p> Lizard 's coat was brindle colored , his eyes were golden brown , his body strong and lithe . He was a gorgeous animal in all aspects , but he always seemed to me to wear such sad expressions in his eyes : boredom , fatigue , loneliness . He was healthy , though , and I spent hours each day exercising and trying to entertain him - anything to change the expression from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-year-old dog . On a day like today in Venezuela , I would have wanted nothing more than a few gentle hours away from those deeply sad eyes . <p> I think back now , among the paper and my sister 's singing , and I realize that in my dog 's eyes , I was actually seeing my own tired , aching sadness . Sadness , because my marriage was falling away , and I was often lonelier when the husband was home than when he was n't . They were Lizard 's eyes that were the windows to my soul , rather than my own , which is why his expressions weighed so heavily on me , and why , even though I took good care of him , I turned my heart away from him . I could n't bear to see myself reflected there . <p> I remember often feeling that I had no chance to escape the empty marriage and the foreign country , and it was during those times that the feel of Lizard 's rough tongue on my salty cheeks , and the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child does sometimes . He always tried to comfort me , even if I would n't love him like I should have . If I had n't been so tormented , I might have found refuge in his devotion to me . <p> Now I am back in Texas , at the edge of a new life and a new identity . In my small bedroom , teddy bears are on my bed where Lizard might have slept . I 've got a job - three , in fact , and new friends . I have begun to do again all the things I only dreamed of doing during three years of lonely Sundays in a dark house that was n't mine , in a country that did n't know me , haunted by the deep , loyal eyes of a velvety brown dog . <p> Sometimes I am exhausted by my constant activity , but even if I must go to work again after only a few hours ' sleep , I only have to think back to how a day like today would have been in Venezuela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enthusiastically carry on . <p> In the end , before I left , I fell into the habit of allowing Lizard to go outside alone through the back door of the house and into the alley . For two years I kept him away from the dogs whose owners let them roam in the streets , but in the end , I thought that if I could give him some small freedom , he might be happy . I thought that it was just as confining for him as it was for me to live in quiet solitude . I knew he would eventually come home - right away at first , but later as he gained authority , he would stay out for more than an hour - and when he did , his eyes would be full of his own mischief , and it would relieve me to see them reflect something other than myself . <p> Secretly , and full of guilt , I always wanted to let Lizard go , so that I would n't have to witness his sadness and my own , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day his new owners - who fell in love with him , by the way - were to come to the house to pick him up . We got up that day as usual , a long stretch of toenails down the bedroom door , the sleepy face so grateful to see mine . We spent the morning on the porch , but this time I watched him watch the clouds , and the way he turned his closed eyes toward the warm sunshine . For lunch I made a three-layer lasagna , and we ate it together right out of the pan . <p> In the afternoon I let him roam the alley , and then he slept for a while with his head on my lap while I stroked his ears and face . When the new owners came , I tried not to cry as I handed over his food , biscuits , and treats , then his toys and his stuffed bear , his favorite leash and the new collar I bought before I knew I was strong enough to start over . When the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first sob escaped . Lizard instantly leapt out of his confusion to try to comfort me , just as I was about to betray him . <p> Even now , I can feel those last grainy licks on my face , and can feel the velvet weight of his fur under my hand as I knelt to hug him . I can remember feeling the sudden terror of imagining a morning without his nails on the door , and then asking the new owners to please , take him now , and finally watching him walk through the big living room , stumbling because he was looking over his shoulder at me instead of at his path . <p> Today is Sunday , and I am happy . But on a day like today , I wish that just one more time I could let Lizard outside , this time going with him . Unleashed , we would run together through the cool green field behind my new apartment instead of through the alley behind the house in Venezuela . I wish that I could kneel down and hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't find enough joy in loving him . I wish I could thank him for helping me , finally , to be free . I wish that just one more time I could look deep into his soft brown and loving eyes where now there would be no sadness . <p> NOTES : Christy Paige Pullen is a writer , firefighter and tutor in English as a second language .
