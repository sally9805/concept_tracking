ContentsCopyright ( C ) William Kilpatrick # BOBBIE AXFORD AND THE raccoon eyed each other , separated by the thickness of her office window . <p> There was an uncanny glint in the raccoon 's eyes . <p> It was a cunning glint , a knowing glint , a glint that stripped her naked . It was the kind of glint she used to see in the eyes of her ex-partner , ex-lover Bill , the treacherous rat . <p> " Get the hell off that ledge ! " she shouted . She smacked at the glass with a rolled-up paper . The animal stood its ground , sure-footed , hairy , blackish-gray , hump-backed . The office was six floors up . In the old days she 'd have been able to open the window , and with one quick shove the disgusting brute would have been history . But city windows did n't open nowadays . <p> Odd that the raccoon should have climbed up all this way . Curiosity ? Death wish ? The ceaseless quest for sexual fulfillment ? Well , he would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axford Proximation Building contained many unusual things , but nothing resembling a female raccoon . <p> Funny that she should assume the thing was male . It was the eyes that did it . That lecherous gleam . <p> Enough of speculation . Time was of the essence , with the Harrods Christmas promotion coming up . Axford Proximation had rented a lot of space and she needed to develop a new and excitingproximation quest to wow the consumers . Casting a final suspicious glance at the raccoon , she returned to the business of guiding Ted through the Drummond scenario . <p> The robot was the latest in a long line of Teds . His predecessors had all met their doom in the giant construct that occupied most of the Axford Proximation building , which in turn sprawled over ten city blocks . Bobbie 's staff primed the construct with perils , aids to survival and prizes , the computer set the parameters for the quest , and she led Ted through the construct 's multiplicity of alternate pathways , checking out the quest 's viability and recording the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff as the Grim Reaper . Death lurked around every corner . <p> At this moment the monitor showed Ted , currently playing the role of Captain Hugh " Bulldog " Drummond , standing in a tiny chamber . His rechargeable flashlight was playing over bright and featureless metallic walls , ceiling and floor . There was no obvious way out , but then there never was . It looked as though Carl Peterson , diabolical mastermind , had beaten him at last . <p> Ted , who was nothing if not sophisticated , felt a flicker of fear . Bobbie checked that the fear had been successfully recorded onto the master . Vicarious emotion was a recent achievement in proximation , and was going to be a big selling feature at Harrods . <p> Next , she considered Ted 's alternatives . The tiny oxygen vial could be useful ; the chamber might shortly be filled with gas , water or whatever . Forget the plastic explosive ; certainly it would blow a hole in those walls , but it would do the same to Ted . <p> She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it himself . And Ted , though sophisticated , did not always decide right . <p> And that reminded her of Bill Kilpatrick , who could never come to a decision about anything , except for the day he walked out on her and Axford Proximation . Bill was a vacillating ninny and she was better off without him . <p> Somewhere beyond the chamber walls came a muffled whir , and a terrified screaming from Ted recalled her to the task . She 'd have to edit that out ; Drummond would never have screamed in that cowardly manner . The robot 's flashlight showed that the chamber was getting smaller . The walls were closing in , slowly but relentlessly . Neat idea . Now , what would a man like Drummond do in such a situation ? She took a mental inventory of available aids to survival . Meanwhile Ted had drawn his laser pistol , a bad mistake . His first shot criss-crossed the chamber with deadly reflections , finally striking Ted himself , fortunately at much reduced power . <p> " You all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothing down his hair . Rupert was a good-looking bastard and knew it . He 'd actually used a hologram of himself as a prize for a female quest . It had sold depressingly well . " I thought I heard someone screaming , " said Rupert . <p> " That was Ted . He 's in a jam . He 's a good screamer . " <p> " Did you know there 's a raccoon outside the window ? " <p> She turned to consider the creature thoughtfully , all business . " Think we can use him ? Are raccoons , uh , deadly in any way ? " <p> " They can carry rabies , I believe . " <p> " Have we used rabies ? " <p> " We have rabid bats and rabid dogs in the Reaper . Raccoons , I do n't think so . I 'll check it out . " He stood behind her , his hands on her shoulders and sliding downward . <p> " Stop that , " murmured Bobbie . " The raccoon will see . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen , I feel uncomfortable . There 's something . . . human about the way that animal looks . It reminds me of Bill . Do me a favor , Rupert . Have one of the staff shoot it off , will you ? " <p> " I 'll shoot it off myself . Who needs it , huh ? As if the pigeons are n't enough . " Rupert sensed rejection and his tone had turned sullen . " How is Bill , by the way ? " he asked pointedly . <p> " I have n't seen that weird guy in months and I do n't want to . " Bobbie swung round in her chair . " Why do you ask ? " She eyed him closely . There was something about Rupert she did n't quite trust . Were his eyes actually shifty or did they simply dart about alertly , the way a good personal assistant 's should ? <p> " I happened to run into his manager Slim Ferris yesterday . Business at Mindset Visions is brisk , he told me . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " Rupert 's eyes shifted , or darted . <p> " What 's ironic ? <p> " You and Bill , I mean . You used to be partners here , now you 're running rival businesses . " <p> " We 're not rivals . " Angrily , Bobbie swung back to face the screen . What in God 's name was Ted doing with that spray can in there ? " Mindset Visions is in an entirely different line of business . " <p> " Yet their sales go up as ours go down . " <p> " Lots of things go up as our sales go down . " But she was worried . Was proximation going out of style ? Were people tiring of armchair adventures ? <p> " Tastes change , " said Rupert , echoing her thoughts . " People change , too . Remember ' Calves ' Stilton ? " <p> Bobbie remembered all too well . H.K. " Calves " Stilton was a legend at Axford Proximation . A man of mighty physique , he 'd been their most inventive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drummond quest , he 'd gone berserk . " The hell with all this pretense , " he 'd reportedly shouted , " life 's too short ! " And he 'd shattered the screen of his monitor with one kick of his oaken legs , hauled open the steel door normally used only by Ted , and stridden into the Grim Reaper personally . <p> They 'd followed his progress on the monitors for a while , as he overcame peril after peril with muscular expertise and lightning reactions , until they lost him in a new scenario where eyespies had not yet been installed . When Bobbie left the office that evening , " Calves " was still in there , presumably battling Carl Peterson , the diabolical mastermind . <p> The story was taken up by Bill Kilpatrick , working late . Apparently " Calves " had emerged triumphant from the Reaper in the small hours , handed in his notice and gone home carrying his prize , a holographic reproduction of Miss Nude Earth 2024 . It was later reported that he 'd gone through a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Altair IV where they 'd lived happily ever since . <p> Such was the legend of H.K. " Calves " Stilton , the only human ever to have walked the deadly corridors of the Grim Reaper . <p> " ' Calves ' was crazy , " said Bobbie . " He must have been crazy from the start but we did n't spot it . Programmers are odd people . ' Calves ' cost us two years ' work on the Drummond quest . You 'd think he 'd have given us all the details of the program before he took off for Altair IV in that irresponsible manner . It 's his fault we 're having to run Ted through the quest . " She sighed . " My God , I wish everyone was like Ted . I know where I am with Ted . He 's simple , and he 's rational . " <p> " If that 's the case , " Rupert pointed out nastily , " why is he spraying the walls of that chamber with shark repellent ? " <p> When Bobbie Axford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disdain for material success and the wealth that came with it . Wealth , in Bill 's books , stank . He blamed it for the break-up with Bobbie . To a certain extent he was right , but he did n't realize another factor was Bobbie 's pride . She 'd founded Axford Proximation and it had prospered hugely , then he 'd come along and tried to get her to change direction . And the subsequent success of Mindset Visions suggested that he 'd been right . <p> At the moment when Ted 's metallic finger was squeezing the button on the can of shark repellent , Bill was sitting in the sordid living room of his tumble-down cottage at Foss Creek , a village with few amenities some thirty kilometers from the city , populated by dropouts and idealists . <p> It says much for Bill 's strength of character that he 'd maintained his squalid lifestyle despite the huge success of Mindset Visions , the business he 'd started after leaving Axford Proximation two years ago . Bill was no fool . He 'd taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free hand . Slim 's curriculum vitae included ten years for embezzlement of charity funds . Bill was confident that he , Slim , would ensure that he , Bill , could continue to live in the manner to which he was accustomed . <p> And now Bill , in his slovenly living room , was wearing the patented headset that represented one-half of his great invention . <p> The other half was implanted in the brain of his raccoon , McArthur . <p> Through the eyes of McArthur , Bill watched Bobbie sitting at her monitor . He watched the entry of Rupert the secretary , saw him pawing Bobbie , and his blood boiled . He could n't hear what they were saying , the window was too thick . Then he saw Rupert stride purposefully from the room , and shortly afterward McArthur 's instincts for self-preservation overrode Bill 's power of suggestion . A section of ledge beside McArthur 's right paw exploded and the raccoon bolted . Whirling impressions of white concrete and blue downspouts bypassed Bill 's optic nerve and registered directly on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to race : like proximation , the mindsets supplied vicarious emotion . Finally the images steadied up , showing dark and ancient brickwork , damp grass and dead leaves . McAnhur had gone to ground . The images faded . His faithful companion was unconscious , maybe dead . <p> Bill tried to come to a decision , always a difficult task . Should he ride boldly to McArthur 's rescue , and risk a confrontation with Bobbie ? Or should he sit tight and keep quiet ? No , he could n't let McArthur rot . He and the raccoon had been through many adventures together . At least he should recover the body and give it a decent burial . <p> But when he arrived at the Axford Proximation he found it was not going to be so simple . Several police stood beside their vehicles , scanning the bushes with infra-red detectors . His heart leaped at the sight of Bobbie , looking beautiful , chatting to the officer in charge . <p> " What 's going on ? " he asked . <p> She favored him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McArthur . " Some busybody reported seeing laser fire . " <p> " It is an offense to discharge a firearm within the city dome , " explained the officer sententiously . <p> " I told you , " replied Bobbie patiently , " it was probably a reflection from inside the building . We use all kinds of weapons in there . Anything my staff can dream up , we use it . We can simulate a nuclear holocaust if we want to . Your witness may have seen one . We have the necessary permits , if that 's what you 're worried about . " <p> In the end the police departed , muttering , and Bobbie swung round on Bill . " What are you doing here , anyway ? " <p> " I just came to pick up McArthur . " <p> " Who the hell is McArthur ? " <p> Bobbie was looking suspicious . Circumstantial evidence was required . " Just an ordinary guy , Winston McArthur , about one-eighty pounds . Salt of the earth . Lost a leg in a boating accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement , would you believe it ? " <p> " You 're lying , " said Bobbie coldly . " I do n't know why , but you 're lying . I can always tell . Now get the hell off my property before I call those cops back . " <p> Bill watched her trot back into the building all long legs and angry buttocks , and after a decent interval began to search the bushes . He soon located McArthur lying under a juniper . The raccoon was unconscious , but Bill could detect a heartbeat . " Poor old guy , you 'll be okay now , " he murmured , gathering McArthur up and carrying him to the car . <p> As he drove back to Foss Creek , Bill pondered on Bobbie 's continuing hostility . Did she dislike him personally , as she might dislike a hairy spider in her shower , or was it a generalized dislike of what he stood for ? If the former , there was little hope of a reconciliation . If the latter , he could try standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for right now ? That was easy enough . He stood for Mindset Visions , business rival of Axford Proximation . He 'd tried to sell the idea of the mindset to Bobbie when they 'd been partners , and she 'd refused . So after the bust-up , the angry words and the threats of legal action , he 'd started up on his own . And the mindset had proved a winner . People had enjoyed experiencing the real-life adventures of their pets and the thing had grown from there , with charter companies implanting lions so that their clients could follow the hunt and experience the kill and the feasting . That aspect was , Bill felt , all rather disgusting . He preferred the innocent prowlings of his raccoon although , even then , there had been that brutal episode when McArthur had raided the chicken coop . Nature was rough and raw and vivid , but that was what people liked , apparently . <p> He sighed . With the Harrods Christmas event coming up , the rift between him and Bobbie could only get worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master , Bobbie found she 'd included shark repellent as an aid to survival , instead of a small but serviceable Diamondite multiple-use club . She restarted the Drummond quest in the shrinking chamber to put matters right . The unexpected meeting with Bill had addled her thinking . <p> " Funny thing , " said Rupert , standing at the window . " Your ex-partner 's driving off with that raccoon . Why would anyone want a dead raccoon ? " <p> She joined him in time to see Bill 's ancient vehicle swaying off down the street . " I told you , he 's weird . . . Wait a minute . " Surely not ! " Do you know what I think ? That raccoon was Bill 's tool ! He implanted it with one of his goddamned devices and sent it to spy on us ! " <p> " Why would he do that ? He knows all our processes already . " <p> " I 'll tell you why . It 's so he can release the solution to the Drummond quest to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single disk if he did that ! " <p> " My God . Maybe it 's as well Ted was screwing up in there . " <p> Stung , she retorted , " Screwing up ? You leave the solutions to me , Rupert , and stick to what you do best . I 've been concerned that the quests are becoming stereotyped so I programmed Ted to introduce a random element . You see the results . " <p> It was not Bobbie 's day . There came a rumbling from behind the office walls . A hatch jerked open and a large cube of crushed metal thudded to the floor . <p> Bobbie knelt beside it . " Is that you , Ted ? Oh , Jesus Christ ! " She felt tears in her eyes . She 'd guided Ted successfully through more adventures than any of his predecessors ; the dangers they 'd shared together had , she felt , resulted in a bond between them . And now this . Through her inattention she 'd allowed him to be bested by Carl Peterson the diabolical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self . " I 'm sorry , Ted , " she whispered brokenfly . <p> " So what happens now ? " said Rupert . <p> " I . . . I suppose we 'll have to send in another Ted . " <p> " There are no more Teds . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " That was the last . I warned you about this a week ago , Bobbie . Western Robotics have cut us off until we pay their account in full . " <p> She stared at him . " Cut us off ? What are we going to do ? How are we going to finish the Drummond quest ? What about the Christmas promotion ? " <p> He hesitated . " There 's one possibility . We could appeal to Bill Kilpatrick . Maybe we could use a mindset and send an expendable raccoon through the course . Or better still , a chimp . " <p> " No way ! I would n't appeal to Bill Kilpatrick if he was the last man in the Universe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can only influence them . In the end they 'll obey their own instincts for self-preservation , and the Drummond quest is no place for quitters . I always said there was a weak link in Bill 's goddamned mindset , and this proves it ! " <p> " Do you have a better idea ? " <p> She gazed at him steadily . " Rupert , in the past you 've professed to love me . Maybe I 've been cautious , maybe even cynical . A woman has a right to be cynical after an experience like Bill Kilpatrick . But maybe I 've been unjust . " <p> " What exactly are you getting at ? " he asked warily . <p> " This is your chance to prove yourself , Rupert . " She took hold of his arm persuasively . " If you truly love me , you 'll do this for me . " <p> " Do what ? " Mounting alarm showed on his face . <p> " You 'll deputize for Ted . " <p> " Deputize for Ted ? Forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way , Rupert . I 'll be sitting here at the monitor , suggesting alternatives , guiding you through . We 'll do it together , Rupert . Partners in the Drummond quest . A melding of souls , battling adversity ! " <p> " You seriously want me to step into the Grim Reaper ? You must be mad ! " <p> She released his arm . " So you wo n't do this thing for me ? " she said quietly . " So you think I 'm mad , do you ? Well , Rupert , I 'll show you just how mad I am . If you wo n't deputize for Ted , I 'll do it myself ! " <p> " Do n't be ridiculous , Bobbie . " <p> " So I 'm ridiculous now , am I ? Because I wan t to save Axford Proximation when you wo n't lift a finger to help ? Well , do n't you worry yourself about me , Rupert . " Her voice rose to a ringing shout . " If ' Calves ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tale , then so can I ! " <p> Next morning the rain fell steadily . Bill Kilpatrick sat in his living room , watching the water dripping from his ceiling into a strategically placed bucket . McArthur lay in his basket nearby , shivering still suffering the effects of the previous day . <p> Bill was wondering not for the first time , what life was all about . It was fine to rid oneself of materialistic trappings and ambitions , but that should n't lead to such abject boredom , surely ? What did he think he was achieving sitting here like this ? Did n't he have something better to do ? Should he take up a hobby , maybe search the foreshore for a suitable piece of driftwood and paint it to look like a brontosaurus ? That 's what most of the residents of Foss Creek did . They seemed happy enough doing it , too . <p> He was on the point of heaving himself out of his chair when the door burst open and Slim Ferris hurried in , rainwater cascading from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slim 's resemblance to the forest mandrill . The close-set eyes , the long red nose , the pronounced brow ridge and pointy head ; they were all there . He could n't have entrusted the fortunes of Mindset Visions to a more suitable man . <p> " Jesus , what a pigsty . " Slim slipped out of his raincoat and shook water over the threadbare carpet . " I 'll never understand why you choose to live like this , Bill . What are you trying to prove , for Chrissake ? " <p> " This is my home , " said Bill simply . " I like it this way . " <p> " You should get a grip on yourself . Buy yourself a suit , get yourself a woman . Take an interest in the business . " <p> " Take an interest in the business ? " Bill was surprised . <p> " Well , not too great an interest . You know me , I like a free hand . But drop by the factory from time to time . Show the flag to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are beginning to think I own the whole shebang myself , can you believe it ? " <p> Reassuring words . " So how are things going ? Are we keeping our heads above water ? " <p> " Things are going just great , Bill . " The tiny eyes gleamed with enthusiasm . " We have all the headsets stockpiled for the Christmas bash and the veterinarians are implanting the recipient animals right now . " <p> " Most people will want to have their own pets implanted , wo n't they ? " <p> " Sure , sure . But cats and dogs can be boring , know what I mean ? We 've got a nice line in hyenas , hammerheads , cobras . I have a great idea for our next venture . " <p> " Do we need another venture ? " <p> " Diversity , Bill , diversity is what oils the machinery of commerce . You know what we need ? A game farm . Wild animals in their natural habitat , near as we can make it . Goes over big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that stuff . Lodges overlooking waterholes . The herds coming to drink in the evenings . " <p> " And the lions moving in for the kill ? " <p> " As they did in Africa , Bill , as they did in Africa . Culling of the weak . Strengthening of the herd . We run it nature 's way . " <p> " Except that our lions would be implanted with mindsets . " <p> " Well , yes . " A shrewd look disfigured Slim 's face . He sat down in the chair opposite Bill , leaning forward confidentially . Glancing over his shoulder , he said , " Sure , people enjoy the kill , why not ? But there 's a twist I 'm discovering . A proportion of our customers  --  say twenty-five , thirty percent  --  a significant number , marketwise , want to be wildebeest . Or zebra , or gazelle . Get it ? They want to be prey . " Slim leaned back , smiling proudly in the way of a mandrill who has imparted valuable information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? It means a sizable reduction in the projected cost of maintaining the herd . " <p> " Listen , Slim , you have n't been promoting cockfighting again , have you ? I told you I would n't stand for that . " <p> The manager of Mindset Visions looked hurt . " We make the mindsets , we implant a few , we sell the rest . We do n't implant fowl of any kind . Their heads are marginally too small , for one thing . " <p> " I heard rumors , that 's all . " <p> " Speaking of rumors , have I got news for you ! " A look of predatory glee spread over Slim 's face . He possessed a wealth of facial expressions , few of them acceptable in human society . " My spies tell me Axford Proximation is in a financial bind ! Looks like they wo n't have their new product ready for the Christmas promotion ! We 're going to clean up at Harrods ! " <p> Bill felt no answering joy . " Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Bobbie Axford 's run out of Teds for trial runs on the Drummond quest ; you remember , ' Calves ' Stilton 's baby ? " <p> Bill stiffened . " The Drummond quest ? " <p> " Yeah , so guess what ! The Axford woman is going into the Reaper herself this morning ! I mean , actually following the routes , checking out the alternatives and trying to find the solution . Apparently ' Calves ' Stilton went off without a word . How dumb can you get ? She 's history , Bill . History ! " He hesitated in an unusual moment of self-examination , sensing a certain tactlessness . " Of course , I know you and her had a few tumbles in the hay once , but all that 's water under the bridge now , I guess , huh ? " <p> But Bill was on his feet , shrugging on an ancient raincoat , hauling McArthur from his basket . " Come on , Slim ! There 's no time to lose . We have to get Bobbie out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's certain death in there ! The Drummond quest killed ' Calves ' Stilton ! " <p> " But I thought he married  --  " <p> " No , he did n't ! It 's all a myth ! ' Calves ' never made it ! I invented the whole story myself ! " <p> " Goddamn . " As Bill 's ancient car bucketed along the narrow lane out of Foss Creek , Slim was unusually silent . Somewhere in a forgotten comer of his black soul there had once glimmered a tiny flame of romance , sustained by the image of " Calves " Stilton and the hologram of Miss Nude Earthlivinghappily ever after . Now the flame was dead , and Slim was the poorer for it . " Goddamn , " he said again , unable to account for his curious feeling of depression . <p> Bobbie Axford , dressed in black leotards and accompanied by Drummond 's faithful mastiff Uppercut , stood in an octagonal room . There was an identical door set into each side , each with its brass knob . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer was simple . Drummond stood over six foot tall and was broad in proportion . He was huge , powerful , and direct . He was an expert boxer , marksman and so on . He hit first and asked questions afterwards . He was pretty well invincible . He would n't have pussyfooted around turning doorknobs . <p> Drawing her small but deadly automatic , she took a short run , leaped and smashed open the nearest door with both feet . As it hit the wall behind her she rolled into a crouch , automatic at the ready . The room was unfurnished apart from a single chair . In the chair sat a man , bound and gagged , blood seeping from a terrible wound covering the whole of one side of his face . <p> The room reverberated to a heavy thud and a yelp from Uppercut , instantly cut off . She spun round . A huge block of concrete stood where the dog had been . It had dropped out of the ceiling and would have reduced her to two dimensions if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injured man and ripped the gag from his mouth . <p> " Who are you ? " she cried . <p> " Professor Masterson , " was the faint reply . <p> " Who did this to you ? " <p> " Peterson , " the man whispered . " Carl Peterson , may his soul rot in hell . He 's the devil incarnate . He aims to take over the world . He tortured Sanderson , but Sanderson would n't talk , so he killed him with a garden spray a few minutes ago . " <p> For the first time , Bobbie noticed the naked body of a man sprawled on the floor behind the chair . His skin was covered with angry red blisters . She knelt beside him . The body had an odd , sickly-sweet smell . <p> " Do n't touch him ! " screamed Masterson . " It 's death ! " <p> " You 'd better tell me what happened . " <p> He was weeping tears of weakness . " It started months ago . I could n't help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to hold out . . . But in the end I gave him the formula . I  --  " <p> " The formula ? she asked keenly . <p> " I developed it myself , and I curse the day I did , but at the time I thought it might come in useful . A deadly poison similar to that used by certain Amazon tribes on their blow-darts , blended with a highly corrosive liquid . One drop of this substance on the skin will kill almost instantly . I happened to mention it at a dinner party one evening , and Peterson was interested . Oh , yes , he was very interested , was that devil Peterson . " <p> " I imagine he would be . It 's his style . " <p> " Since then , he 's been mass-producing it . . . " The voice was becoming fainter . " And now he 's talking about a trial run . " <p> There was no time to lose . " Which way did he go ? " <p> " He went upstairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes held a gleam of cunning . " Which was it ? I . . . " His eyes rolled up . His head lolled . He was dead . <p> There was a door in the far wall . Bobbie kicked it open and rolled through . This time , the Drummond method met with scant success . There were two flights of stone steps immediately beyond the door ; one leading up , the other down . With no chance to consider alternatives , Bobbie tumbled downward into darkness . A door slammed shut behind her . <p> Picking herself up shakily , she took out her rechargeable flashlight and examined her surroundings . She was in a small , featureless , windowless room . The place had a curious smell that she recognized instantly . It was not the sickly-sweet smell of the body upstairs . It was the sharp , metallic smell of shark repellent . <p> Her route had converged with the route of the late Ted . <p> At least she knew what to expect next . She took out her small but serviceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The walls began to close in . She extended the club to its maximum length , slightly greater than the span of her shoulders . <p> Ted had finished up as a cube . What did this tell her ? Two opposite walls must converge to a pre-determined point and stop . Then narrow sections would emerge from the other two walls like plungers , reducing her space to a tall box . Then a square section of the ceiling would descend , and her space would become a Ted-sized cube , and she would be crushed . Bobbie had often boasted to the media that there were very few fake effects in the Grim Reaper . This was real . For an instant she knew fear . <p> She shook it off . There would be time for fear later on . Right now , she knew the answer . As the walls approached she positioned the club carefully at right angles . The walls met the ends of the indestructible club , the whirring deepened . She heard a sharp splintering sound . A crack developed in one wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section fell away . She stepped through into a large , well-lit room . <p> Huge rams stood against the walls , rods extended . In one comer was a heavy , humming compressor . It seemed a lot of expensive equipment for the sole purpose of reducing a robot to a cube . No wonder Axford Proximation was in financial difficulties . She 'd have a serious talk with Rupert when she got out . <p> Rupert . Was he recording her adventures the way she 'd taught him yesterday afternoon , or was he goofing off ? She looked around for an eyespy lens , and spotted one at the top corner of the room . <p> " You 'd better not be missing any of this stuff , Rupert ! " she shouted , hauling open a door and running up a flight of stairs . <p> She paused at the top , in another octagonal chamber where Uppercut was waiting for her , having apparently dodged the concrete block after all . You could n't make assumptions in the Drummond quest . She listened carefully at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft coughing . Kicking the door open she found herself in a luxuriously appointed bedroom . An old woman lay in bed , frail , skin like parchment , clearly at death 's door . Her left hand lay limply across the brocade coverlet . Faded eyes flickered open . <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Bobbie . " I did n't mean to intrude . " <p> " Come in , my dear , come in . Sit yourself down . It 's not often an old lady like me gets visitors . Tell me , what brings you to these parts ? " <p> Uppercut snarled softly . Had Bobbie stumbled into the wrong scenario ? This looked like a Regency quest . Many quests used common scenarios ; it saved space and money . <p> She was about to leave when she noticed something . The old woman 's left hand had come alive , and the fingers were beating a ceaseless tattoo on the bedclothes . She stared , hardly able to believe the evidence of her eyes . That old habit was a giveaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise be . The fingers drumming , as though practicing on an invisible piano . It was Peterson lying there ! <p> " Carl , " she murmured . " My old adversary . We meet again . " <p> " Curse you , Drummond ! " snarled the other . He leaped from the bed , kicking aside a half-hearted attack by Uppercut , revealing himself as a tall , powerful individual wearing a tux . " It will be the last time , I assure you . Take him , Mustafa ! " <p> Bobbie 's arms were seized from behind . Despite her prodigious power she was unable to free herself , her captor had the strength of ten men , not to mention the advantage of surprise . She straggled impotently , cursing . Peterson produced a cord , and in an instant her wrists were securely bound . Mustafa , who proved to be a gigantic , swarthy Turk , held her arm in a vice-like grip . <p> Stepping back , his equanimity restored , Peterson said smoothly , " This is indeed a fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dinner party for various minor Heads of State and we 'll be delighted to have your company . It 's a rehearsal for a much bigger game , but I wo n't bore you with the details since you wo n't be around to play the next round . What a pity . I 've so enjoyed our rivalry in the past . " <p> Propelled by Mustafa , Bobbie was forced up a flight of stairs and along a dim corridor . Peterson paused before a pair of heavy , gilded double doors . trust you are going to watch your manners , my friend , " he said . " You are about to meet some very influential people . I will untie your wrists so that you may join us at dinner . But , " and the menace in his voice chilled Bobbie 's blood , " any tricks , and it will be the worse for you . " <p> " You may depend on my good breeding " she heard herself say coldly . " That , I think , is the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the double doors , revealing a brightly lit dining room with a dozen guests in formal attire , already seated . The table was laid with silver cutlery and Waterford crystal , a set Bobbie recognized from several previous quests . The only new item was a huge crystal chandelier instead of the more usual candles . <p> " Gentlemen , " Peterson announced , " I 'd like you to meet Captain Hugh ' Bulldog ' Drummond , DSO , MC , late of His Majesty 's Royal Loamshires . Captain Drummond will be joining us for dinner . " <p> There were two vacant chairs . Peterson seated himself at the head of the table and Bobbie about halfway along , between a spare elderly man whose face was vaguely familiar and a heavily tanned man with an Australian accent . Peterson , toying with his food , watched with thinly veiled contempt as the diners noisily devoured appetizers in the form of barbecued chicken wings . Bobbie did n't eat , but tried a couple of wings on Uppercut . They appeared to do him no harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to use hers when she noticed an odd smell . A sickly-sweet smell , somehow familiar . What did it remind her of ? And where was it coming from ? <p> Suddenly she jumped to her feet and uttered a mighty shout , freezing the conversation dead with its intensity . <p> " Do n't use the finger bowls , for God 's sake ! It 's death ! " <p> The guests stared at Bobbie in outraged amazement . Peterson laughed quietly . <p> " What do you mean , death ? " said the Australian . " Is this some kind of a joke ? " <p> " Perhaps this will convince you , " she said coolly and , taking her finger bowl , she set it down before Uppercut . The mastiff lapped it up with every appearance of healthy thirst . <p> Bobbie felt herself flushing . Could she , possibly , have made a fool of herself ? It would be  --  she felt herself slipping into her Drummond persona again  --  damnably bad form . She watched Uppercut for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My mistake , " she murmured , sitting down quickly . <p> Mustafa served a cold consomme . <p> " Lord Charlton , " the elderly man introduced himself to Bobbie in a dry murmur . " Fine dog you have , Captain . I had a mastiff myself , once . Had the brute put down . Worrying sheep , do n't you know . " <p> The Australian roared with laughter . " I had my mastiff put down because it worried my wife ! " Still laughing , he turned to the man on his right . " Why did you have your mastiff put down , Bruce ? " <p> Bobbie listened , annoyed . The discussion dragged on , dealing solely with mastiff euthanasia until the end of the fifth course . " Calves " Stilton had been economizing on dialogue again . If she 'd told him once , she 'd told him a thousand times . Talk was cheap but effects cost the earth . <p> Deep in thought , she suddenly awakened to the fact that everyone was standing . Peterson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he intoned , " The King ! " <p> As she automatically raised her own glass , a sickly-sweet stench caught at her nostrils . She stared in horror at the liquid , then at Peterson . <p> " Do n't drink ! " she shouted , then added apologetically , " It 's death . " <p> Amid general laughter the guests drained their glasses unscathed , while Peterson regarded her with a thin smile . " Jumpy , are you , Drummond ? Nerves a little bit shot ? You think this is death ? I 'll show you death . " <p> And he walked across the room and pulled a lever projecting from the wall . <p> The chandelier shook and tinkled , and a deadly rain began to fall . <p> SLIM FERRIS was basically a coward . The notion of death was fascinating when applied to his many enemies , but lost its charm when it became personal and immediate . " Slow down , for God 's sake ! " he shouted . " You 'll kill us both ! " <p> " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Life has all kinds of meaning if she dies ! It 's us dying I 'm worried about . Anyway , how can we save her if we 're both dead ? " <p> The logic of this argument got through to Bill , and he eased his foot off the pedal . " Sorry . It 's just that there 's all kinds of dangers in the Drummond quest that Bobbie does n't know about . Real dangers as well as simulations . Dangers worthy of ' Bulldog ' Drummond . " <p> " Who the hell is this Drummond guy , anyway ? " <p> " ' Bulldog ' Drummond ? He was my childhood idol . The first of the super-heros , really . He was enormously big and strong , yet he could move quietly as a cat . If he got in a jam , and he usually did , he did n't mess around trying to reason his way out of it . He used his fists and his lightning reactions . He did n't know the meaning of the word fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although you never knew who his parents were . He had a group of friends who thought he was God . He drank vast quantities of beer , too . " <p> " He sounds like ' Calves ' Stilton . " <p> " He could make split-second decisions . I used to wish I was like Drummond . " <p> Slim eyed him curiously . " So how come ' Calves ' programmed the quest ? Why did n't you write it yourself ? " <p> Bill hesitated . His secret was bound to come out , now . " Matter of fact , I did . " <p> " What ! But everyone at Axford Proximation thinks ' Calves ' wrote it ! " <p> " The truth is , ' Calves ' might have looked impressive in the flesh but he was n't very bright . I used to cover for him a lot . But he 'd never admit he had problems , even to himself . He 'd been straggling with a minor part of the program for days . I should have noticed and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big stuff . Then suddenly he lost patience , and before I could stop him he 'd gone through the door of the Reaper to sort it out personally . I saw him die . Carl Peterson trapped him in a sea-cave on a rising tide . Poor old ' Calves ' was dumb to the end . He built himself a raft instead of following a faint breeze of curiously fresh air to its source . " <p> " Jesus . " <p> " Slim , I designed the cave scenario . I killed ' Calves . ' I could n't face the truth and the guilt and the contempt , so I invented the Miss Nude Earth story and I let everyone think he 'd done the work on the Drummond quest himself . " He drew a deep breath . " My God , I feel better now I 've got it off my chest . " <p> There was a long silence between them . The domed city loomed ahead , silver and huge . Eventually Slim said , " It must have been difficult for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing your hero off . " <p> Bill scowled , reliving an old grievance . " I was n't dreaming up ways of killing off Drummond , not really . I was dreaming up ways of killing off Ted . " <p> " The robot ? Why ? " <p> " It was the way Bobbie talked about him . Forever singing his goddamned praises and comparing him with me . ' Ted 's so resourceful , ' he mimicked in a high falsetto . ' Ted 's so decisive , so determined , so resolute . Nothing fazes Ted . ' Well , I admit I 'm not the most dynamic guy in the world , and I got sick of hearing about Ted . One day I caught Bobbie looking at me in a considering way , and do you know what she said ? She said Ted was a better man than I. My God ! " <p> " Shall we turn round ? " suggested Slim hopefully . " Go back to your place and talk it through ? Maybe have a beer or two ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? Now Bobbie 's facing all those dangers I dreamed up for Ted . " <p> " You 'll never find her . The Reaper covers ten blocks . " <p> " I 'll find her . I know the general location of the Drummond quest ; the only problem is , I do n't know which alternatives Bobbie might have taken , and I quit working on the program before I 'd had all the eyespies installed . So we 're going to call in at Mindset Visions and pick up our implanted small animals . Then I 'm going to send them through the Reaper 's wiring ducts . They 'll be my eyes . One of them will find Bobbie , soon enough . Then I 'll take a short cut in and get her out of there . " <p> " Can you control fifty or so animals at once ? " Slim was doubtful . <p> " I do n't need to control them . I just send them scuttling through the ducts in the Drummond area , and I tune into them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out again . " <p> " They 're expendable ! " cried Bill . " Bobbie 's all that matters ! " <p> " It 's good-bye to the Harrods promotion if you 're going to sacrifice all our livestock , " objected Slim . " Think , Bill . Is she really worth it ? It 's Bobbie Axford we 're talking about . The woman who compared you unfavorably to Ted . " <p> To Bill 's credit , the car only slackened speed for a moment . " Ted 's out of the way now . You told me yourself . " <p> " There 'll be other Teds . " <p> " Not if Axford Proximation goes under , the way you said it would . " <p> " To save Bobbie you 'll have to solve the Drummond quest . So you 'll hand Axford Proximation their Harrods promotion on a plate . That means they wo n't go under . So there 'll be many more Teds , all better men than you . " <p> " My God , " muttered Bill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her collapsible umbrella and extended it briskly . <p> " What the  --  " exclaimed Lord Charlton , regarding the chandelier . But he said no more . <p> All around her the dinner guests were slumping across the table like drunks , but there was no alcohol in the frightful fluid that sprayed from the chandeliers ; there was only death . The Australian , more resistant than the others through copious use of suntan oil , was staring at Peterson in horror . <p> " Why in God 's name . . . ? " Then angry blisters erupted on his forehead , and he too fell forward , dead . <p> Peterson watched from the far side of the room , motionless and silent apart from his habitual soft cough . He suffered from liver fluke , an incurable condition caused by a meal of undercooked escargots many years ago . It was his only known weakness . His cold gaze roamed around the table , coming to rest at Bobbie . <p> " So , Drummond , our little game is over . It has been easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice touch . What a pity that it only postpones the inevitable . " <p> " What are you going to do next , you devil ? " Bobbie grated . <p> " Next ? Why , I 'm going to hold the nations of the world to ransom , what else ? I shall stockpile Professor Masterson 's excellent fluid , meanwhile giving a few practical demonstrations of its worth . A blimp might be useful for spraying a large gathering at some kind of sporting event ; the details are immaterial at this time . When I have convinced people I mean business , I shall start talking about water supplies , and the possibilities of unexpected contamination . Oh ; the fluid dilutes very satisfactorily , my dear Drummond . A liter in a reservoir , and . . . Well , I leave you to dwell on the consequences . Meanwhile , I fear I must leave you . Oh , and by the way . If I were you I 'd lift my feet dear of the floor . " <p> So saying , he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . <p> The deadly rain ceased to fall , yet Bobbie could still hear a splashing sound . It seemed to be coming from the double doors by which she 'd entered . As she watched , they burst open and a tidal wave of liquid swept across the floor toward her . She lifted her feet hastily . The characteristic smell of Professor Masterson 's poison was almost overpowering . The wave passed under her chair and the level continued to rise rapidly . She climbed onto the chair , balancing precariously . <p> But this was only a game , was n't it ? The poison was some harmless but evil-smelling junk formulated by that fool " Calves , " surely ? And the diners were all humanoid robots . So all she had to do was step down from the chair , wade to the door and out of here . <p> And yet . . . <p> It was all so convincing . She had to admit , " Calves " had done a good job . That stuff rising around her chair , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin will kill almost instantly . That was what Professor Masterson had said . But the Professor was a robot , too . <p> And even if the stuff was merely some kind of sewage , she 'd drown in here if she did n't hurry up and get out of this room . <p> So , it was a question of dipping her toe in and she 'd have the answer . One way or another . . . She tried to do it . She failed . She stood there tottering , scared to touch the liquid , scared not to , indecisive as . . . As Bill Kilpatrick , for God 's sake ! what was the matter with her ? <p> And then something floated into view , something so terrible that any thought of paddling was banished instantly from her mind . <p> It was the body of a man on a makeshift raft . <p> He lay face-down on boards roughly lashed together , dressed in the tattered remains of a blue track suit . One of his arms hung into the liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone had disappeared . . . <p> He drifted past her chair on the rising waters , and if she had n't seen the decayed remains of his face , mouth contorted in a dying scream , she 'd still have recognized that track suit , once stretched so tightly over a powerful frame . <p> It was H.K. " Calves " Stilton ! <p> She stared at the blackened face , appalled . What tortures had this man suffered ? How long had he been living in the bowels of the Reaper , eating the scraps thrown down the chutes for the piranhas , the rats and the cobras ? And what about his reported escape and his marriage to Miss Nude Earth ? <p> Obviously , it had never happened . <p> It was a lie , put about by that bastard Bill Kilpatrick . And the lie had prevented a search and rescue operation . In effect , Bill had condemned " Calves " to death in the brutal corridors of the Grim Reaper . <p> Bobbie found herself weeping . " God damn you all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the fluid lapped against the underside of her chair . <p> " Sure Bobbie 's in there , " said Rupert easily . " I had her on the screen only a moment ago . Then I lost her . " <p> " Of course you did , " snapped Bill . " Did n't you know the Drummond quest was never finished ? Most of the alternatives do n't have eyespies installed yet . " <p> " Bill 's kind of fired up about all this , Rupe , " Slim explained . " I told him what you told me about the , uh , financial squeeze and everything , and he reckons Bobbie 's up against it in the Reaper . He wants to get her out , fast . " <p> Bill was staring at Rupert . " You 've been discussing Axford Proximation 's financial affairs with Slim ? " <p> " There 's no call to use that tone of voice , " said Rupert , hurt . " I would n't harm a hair on Bobbie 's head . But I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people pay well for information . " <p> " Do we , Slim ? My God , I do n't like the sound of this ! I never authorized industrial espionage ! " <p> It was Slim 's turn to look hurt . " I told you I had spies . " <p> " Well , yes , but anyone can say they have spies . It 's just a goddamned saying . I thought you just meant you 'd heard rumors . But this is specific . This is a real spy , in the flesh . " Bill regarded Bobbie 's personal assistant in disgust . " This is goddamned Rupert . " <p> " If it helps at all , he was lying about the sick wife . Actually , he 's after Bobbie 's body , buying her gifts and such . " <p> " We pay him so he can satisfy his lust ? " Bill was outraged . <p> " That 's putting it a bit strong , " Rupert objected . " I want you to know I respect Bobbie as a woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't , I 'm going to punch you on the nose ! " <p> " You were worried about Bobbie in the Reaper , " Slim reminded Bill hastily . <p> " Jesus , yes , I was forgetting . Take the raccoons through the main entrance , Slim . Square the programmers and the mechanics . Tell them raccoons are natural burrowers and have them push them into the ducting . Who said I could n't make decisions ? I just hope we 're not too late ! " <p> He put on his headset and in due course began to pick up visions of dusty tubing . Soon the raccoons emerged into empty rooms , open fields , rolling oceans , each with their hidden stock of perils awaiting the coming of the next Ted . <p> On his third rotation through the implanted animals , Bill saw Bobbie balanced on her chair in a flooded room . The level was still rising , and it was clear that she was past the point of rational action . Her mouth was wide open , her face contorted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He took in the situation at a glance . " Rupert , let me have the pass key to the stock rooms . I 'm going to need some equipment . " <p> As the water lapped around the soles of Bobbie 's shoes , she heard the creaking of rusty hinges from the door through which the master criminal had gone . Had he relented ? Was he returning to cut off the flow of this dreadful liquid ? <p> " Peterson ! " she screamed . <p> " Well , actually , no , it 's me , Bobbie . " Of all people , it was Bill Kilpatrick , balanced on stilts and wading unsteadily toward her ! <p> She 'd never been so glad to see him . " Bill ! Hurry , this stuffs going to come through my shoes in a minute . Turn round and let me climb on your back ! " <p> But he seemed reluctant . " I 'm not very good on these stilts . The dinghy would have been better , but I did n't have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovering his balance with difficulty . " I do n't think I could carry you . It would be a disaster , really . I just know it . " <p> " So what am I going to do ? Stand here and die ? " <p> " Well , what ' Bulldog ' Drummond would do , you see , is to grab hold of the back of another chair and move it nearer the door , and step on it . Then he 'd move the one you 're on now in front of it , and so on . He 'd step from one to the other , all the way to the door . " <p> " My God , I never thought of that . That 's pretty smart of you , Bill . " Dragging the chair from under the slumped Australian , Bobbie made her way steadily to the short flight of steps leading to the door . With a thrill of horror she watched Bill 's leg sink up to the knee in the fluid as he dismounted . But he seemed unharmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is Professor Masterson 's poison , anyway ? " <p> " Water , I guess . " He looked guilty . <p> " So why the stilts ? Why did I have to go through that performance with the chairs ? " <p> " Because of the piranhas , actually . All the water in the Reaper has piranhas in it ; you know that . " <p> They passed through the door , mounted the stairs and found themselves in yet another octagonal room . Bobbie looked from door to door uncertainly . Then from behind the nearest she heard the soft coughing that would destroy Peterson , one day . " Come on , " she said , turning the knob . <p> " No ! " He seized her around the waist , drawing her back . " That 's not Peterson . My guess is , it 's a tape recorder suspended over a pit of cobras - notice the echo ? " <p> He pushed the door with the tip of a stilt so that it swung gently open , and sure enough the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears . She shivered and clung to Bill . " I 'd have stepped right into that , " she murmured . " ' Calves ' sure had some creepy ideas . " <p> " Sometimes it does n't pay to make snap decisions , " said Bill . " I always like to reason out the possibilities  --  it comes of being a programmer . And I kind of felt there might be a snake pit there . " <p> " Sorry . I may have said some hasty things about you in the past , Bill . " <p> He smiled in a masterful manner . " My guess is , Peterson will be in here . " And he flung open the opposite door . <p> They found themselves in a domed circular room , vaulting and empty apart from a massive relief globe of the Earth in the center . The globe must have been at least five meters across , revolving slowly on a steel axis projecting from the floor . A circular platform ran around it at the level of the equator , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lowered . <p> A tall man dressed in a tux strolled around this platform , keeping pace with the revolutions and examining a small area of the globe with absorbed interest . <p> " We meet again , Carl , my old adversary , " said Bill softly . <p> Peterson swung around with a snarl of hatred . " Drummond ! So you 're not dead after all ! " <p> " You 've said that many times in the past , Peterson , but you wo n't be saying it again . " <p> The master criminal recovered his equanimity , chuckling . " Too late , Drummond . Always too late . " Still walking to keep up with the rotation of the globe , he indicated a small red button set in a mountainous area . " You see this button ? When I press it in approximately ten seconds ' time , a measured quantity of Professor Masterson 's poison will be released into the Tokyo water supply . A great number of people will die , and the nations of the world will realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolled around the far side of the globe . " Seven . . . Six . . . Five . . . " <p> Bobbie watched in wonder as Bill , with reactions worthy of " Calves " Stilton himself , sprang to a control panel on the wall and twisted a knob . The globe began to accelerate . Peterson came into view from the far side , breaking into a brisk trot . " Four . . . Three . . . " He began to ran . The button moved inexorably away from his outstretched forefinger . With an animal screech of rage , Peterson chased after it . The features of the globe became a whiffing blur . Peterson made one more desperate circuit of the platform , then jumped to the floor , panting . <p> Bobbie recoiled from the naked hatred in his face . " You 've beaten me this time , Drummond , " he snarled . " But the next time will be different . " <p> " There wo n't be a next time , Peterson , " said Bill coldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he raised his stilt and laid the robber tip , still wet , against the master criminal 's cheek . <p> Whether the poison was diluted by the copious sweat streaming from Peterson 's face , or whether he alone possessed some strange natural immunity , or whether it was merely good theater on the part of the programmer , Bobbie never knew . But it took Peterson several seconds to die . And in those seconds , the normally suave expression went through a hideous transformation until the master criminal was revealed as he really was , something scarcely human , something almost bestial , snarling and slavering and dropping into a crouch , fingers hooked and stretched toward them in a last instinctive compulsion to destroy . Then he collapsed and rolled onto his back and died , face erupting and peeling as the corrosive fluid continued to do its dreadful work . <p> " Not bad , huh ? " said Bill . <p> Bobbie drew a shaky breath . " Let 's get out of here , shall we ? " She clung to Bill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly appeared beyond the globe . Words began to scroll down a huge screen before them . " I 've been so wrong about you , " she said . " You 're quite the man of action , after all . I 'm so sorry I called you a vacillating wimp . . . " <p> " Well , hell , I do n't like to blow my own trumpet  --  " <p> But Bobbie was n't listening . She was staring at the words on the screen , and her expression was undergoing a change not unlike the recent transformation of the late Carl Peterson . <p> pre CONGRATULATIONS ON DEFEATING PETERSON THE MASTER CRIMINAL PASS THROUGH THIS DOOR OR PRESS F10 TO COLLECT YOUR PRIZE ANOTHER ADVENTURE SIMULATION BY AXFORD PROXIMATION And the final , damning words : <p> Copyright ( C ) William Kilpatrick " You ! " cried Bobbie . " You programmed the Drummond quest yourself ! You told me it was ' Calves ' Stilton , but all the time it was you ! No wonder you showed up so well in there  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a fool I 've been ! " <p> " Well , I , uh . . . " <p> " And that 's another thing ! All those lies you told about ' Calves ' living happily ever after with Miss Nude Earth , while really the poor guy was dying in there . I 'll see you behind bars for that , you bastard ! That 's why Peterson was so convincing . He 's autobiographical ! " <p> " Let me explain about ' Calves . ' " <p> " I do n't want to hear it . I do n't want to hear your voice or see your face ever again . Now just get out of my life , will you ! " <p> So once again Bill Kilpatrick sat in his dingy living room , trying to persuade himself of the virtues of the simple monastic life , wearing his headset as he followed the adventures of McArthur . At the moment the raccoon was trying without success to catch fish in a tide pool , watched by the critical eye of another raccoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mind . <p> There came a welcome knock at the door . <p> Slim Ferris was bubbling with enthusiasm , as ever . " Great news , Bill ! Axford Proximation have pulled out of the Harrods Christmas promotion . My spies  --  that is , Rupert  --  could n't record the final stages of the Drummond quest because the eyespies had n't been installed . Terrific , huh ? " <p> " Bobbie will never forgive me , " groaned Bill . <p> " She did n't seem to blame you when I spoke to her yesterday . In fact she seemed to be talking in terms of a closer relationship between Axford Proximation and Mindset Visions . I even took her a few sample headsets to try out . They 've still got half our implanted animals wandering about inside the Reaper . " <p> " It 's not just the Harrods thing . She blames me for the death of ' Calves . ' " <p> Some of Slim 's ebullience faded . " Too bad about ' Calves . ' You know , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder how he was doing , up there on Altair with Miss Nude Earth . " <p> " A hologram of Miss Nude Earth . There 's a difference . " Bill was a stickler for accuracy . <p> " Yeah . Anyway , I told Bobbie about you sitting helpless at your monitor , watching ' Calves ' drown in the cave . It was kind of a catharsis for me , talking about it . I did n't tell her you 'd designed the cave . " <p> " How did she take it ? " <p> Slim considered . " Not bad . " <p> " Well , what did she say , exactly ? " <p> " I guess she said : ' How fortunate for Bill , not having to make a decision . ' But then she kind of gulped , and I could see she 'd appreciated your , uh , plight . " <p> " I doubt if she 'd appreciate anything about me . She thought I was spying on her through McArthur . " <p> " I explained that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on her now and then . I tell you , you 're back in favor . " <p> " I ca n't think of a single reason why . " <p> " Maybe she loves you . Or more likely , " said Slim , always flexible enough to abandon an untenable theory , " Axford Proximation needs bailing out and she sees you as a source of funding . " <p> Bill thought about it , watching idly while McArthur tried unsuccessfully to catch small fish . It was impossible that Bobbie should love him after the fiasco in the Reaper . <p> But did he still love her ? Probably , and an unrequited love fitted in with the notion of a monastic existence . It ' compounded the gloom in a most satisfactory manner . Yes , he loved Bobbie , but he could never tell her because he could n't face the rejection . And even if by some amazing chance she did love him , she 'd be too goddamned proud to tell him . Stalemate . <p> " But I ca n't afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close relationship between the two corporations might have softened Bobbie up , given time . <p> " Of course you can afford it . You 're worth millions . " <p> Bill laughed bitterly . " Oh , sure . " He waved an arm at his appalling living conditions . " It looks like it , does n't it ? " <p> " For Christ 's sake , you do n't have to live in this dump . " Slim waved a print-out as a mandrill might wave a prime banana . " I brought the latest figures . Take a look , for once in your life . Bottom line , your net worth . Pretty goddamned good , huh ? " <p> " But . . . " Bill felt his eyebrows climbing as he regarded the staggering figure . " But I thought . . . I thought you 'd , uh . . . I mean to say , hell , you ca n't blame a guy for dipping into the till when temptation 's shoved under his nose . . . " <p> Slim stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the profits ? Jesus , Bill , that hurts . After you trusted me enough to put me in charge , with my record ? " His tone became aggressive . " I tell you , I 've run a tight ship . I 've never touched a penny of your goddamned money . " <p> Bill began to babble as the figures on the print-out reproached him . " Hell , no , I did n't mean that . No , you misunderstand me , Slim . I just felt , you know , development costs . . . Inflation . . . New product advertising , all that stuff . . . I 'm just surprised the bottom line 's so goddamned big , that 's all . " <p> " Oh , that 's all right , then . " Slim regarded him doubtfully . " So what are we going to do about Axford Proximation ? " <p> Bill tried to think about it , his brain still grappling with his unexpected wealth . Axford Proximation and Mindset Visions both sold adventure , basically . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bail Bobbie out . <p> But she was a proud woman . She 'd never make the first move . And his very soul shrank at the prospect of approaching her . She 'd assume he was trying to buy her body . <p> Jesus Christ , what a dilemma ! <p> Animals did n't have that kind of problem . Idly he watched a pleasant scene through the eyes of McArthur . The raccoon had given up on fishing and was taking a mild interest in the animal on the far side of the tide pool . The two raccoons circled for a moment , then McArthur stopped and the other animal approached , head down , rump waggling . Bill felt himself flush .
