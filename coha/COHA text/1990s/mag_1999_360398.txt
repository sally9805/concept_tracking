It is the year 2025 , and some things have n't changed . The sky is still blue . The Dow is poised to set another record . And Jose Rodriguez ( Michigan State , class of ' 04 ) has just learned that he has colon cancer . But he 's not too concerned . Thanks to the genetic revolution that swept over the pharmaceutical industry 30 years earlier , scientists have developed a variety of anticancer drugs that work far better , and with fewer side effects , than the old poison-and-burn treatments of the late 20th century . <P> The oncologist takes a few cells from Jose 's tumor and places them on a microchip . Within minutes , the chip identifies five mutant genes that , like some kind of diabolical cheerleading squad , have pushed Jose 's cancer to grow , grow , grow . Someday , perhaps soon , doctors will be able to fix the wayward genes themselves . Until then , they will have to rely on the next best thing : drugs developed by pharmaceutical firms that block the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician selects a combination of treatments that matches the tumor 's genetic profile . Six months later , no trace of Jose 's cancerous growth can be found . <P> That scenario is not as farfetched as it sounds . Talk to anyone in the pharmaceutical industry , and you 'll soon discover that genetics is the biggest thing to hit drug research since a penicillium mold floated into Alexander Fleming 's petri dish . Sure , scientists have long known genes play a role in almost every ailment from Alzheimer 's to yellow fever . But it is only in the past few years that they 've learned how to use that information to identify a multitude of new targets and pathways for drug design . Let 's count the ways . <P> THE NEW MATH <P> Geneticists estimate that there are 2,000 to 5,000 genes that either cause , or predispose humans to , various diseases . In practical terms , that means there will be many , many more potential avenues of research than the entire pharmaceutical industry could possibly hope to investigate over the next 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonanza , and most are more than happy to tell you what 's wrong with the other guy 's approach . But they all agree on a few key points : <P>  --  Drugs will be safer , more powerful and much more selective than ever before . <P>  --  Doctors will be able to consult your genetic profile to determine ahead of time whether you are more likely to respond to one type of medication or another . <P>  --  Computers and other digital technologies are going to play a much bigger role in evaluating new research and determining how patients should be treated . <P> THE GOOD OLD DAYS <P> To understand how this promising future might come to pass , it pays to review a little history . Back in the old days  --  which is to say just a few decades ago  --  the process of discovering a new drug was a lot like shooting a quiver of arrows into the air and then running around to see what they hit . Occasionally scientists would get lucky , as Fleming did in 1928 , but most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
