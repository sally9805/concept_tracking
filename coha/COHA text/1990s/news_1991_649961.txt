##@x <p> Why did all the weight of the Bush Administration come down on General Schwarzkopf for revealing that the decision to abort the war a day too soon was not unanimous  --  or as the general later half-clarified , not as originally planned ? <p> The reason is that the pre-decision disagreement within the National Security Council was supposed to be kept secret . <p> No President lightly consigns thousands of human beings to certain death . He had personally and publicly assured the Kurdish and Shiite rebels that Saddam 's gunships would be grounded ; his general on the scene admitted he had been " suckered " into agreeing to let them fly . <p> When a decision is made to place cool pragmatism above morality  --  in this case , to accept historic accountability for choosing military dictatorship over a less orderly system of self-determination  --  the President expects his advisers to close ranks , to " sign on " to the decision . Nobody is supposed to say that the chief executive was torn between what was expedient and what was right . <p> Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources other than my own imagination , but here were the conflicting forces : <p> The strongest voice for ending the shooting before Saddam Hussein 's army was destroyed was Colin Powell , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs . True to his Weinberger training , he did not want us to be blamed for overkill , or to be drawn into responsibility for replacing Saddam Hussein ; he wanted U.S. troops withdrawn before American public opinion became impatient or terrorists hit . <p> Supporting this was the State Department 's James Baker , influenced heavily by Saudi Arabia 's Prince Bandar . Reasoning : only a Sunni Moslem military dictator in Baghdad would be stable enough to provide a balance against Iran , and a U.S.-imposed democracy might split into three nations . ( Later , influential Israelis agreed , based on the selfish concern that Kurdish independence might lead to Palestinian statehood . ) <p> Mildly opposing this premature cessation was the national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , not happy about leaving the job half done , and Vice President Quayle , concerned about the President 's credibility with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of General Powell 's reminder about losing lives in Lebanon , zipped his lip . <p> Result : President Bush wavered , then decided to cut his winnings and go home . He flip-flopped on his pledge to shoot down Iraqi gunships , leaving his spokesmen admitting " ambiguity . " In the name of realpolitik , he made our forces bear shamefaced witness to the bloodletting now under way . <p> Must history remember George Bush as the liberator of Kuwait and the man who saved Iraq for dictatorship ? Preserving Saddam I or planting Saddam II would have other costs : People like the too-trusting Kurds now know they can get killed by relying on Mr. Bush 's assurances . U.S. troops will return home with a sense of shame at the bloodletting that followed our political sellout . <p> Having refused to impose the opportunity for the rudiments of democracy in what we left of Iraq , Mr. Bush would then presume to impose his settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute . Good luck . <p> For one bright , shining moment we had a President who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Bush did not go to war primarily for oil , or for jobs , or even for protection against incipient attack ; his decision to liberate Kuwait was bottomed on hardrock principle , to right a wrong in a world too accustomed to accommodating imperial wrongdoing . <p> That moral courage , backed by the will to use power , carried the day , rolling over contrary opinion , emboldening the coalition , vitiating the will to fight of the Iraqi troops . It was n't " self-righteousness " after all ; it was right . <p> Now that same feeling for a moral world order demands we give the people of Iraq a last chance for freedom . We are there , occupying a fifth of the country ; we created the opportunity for a federation of autonomous peoples ; we can not creep away with our internal allies exposed to Soviet-made aircraft and tanks . <p> Mr. Bush still has time to say : " No more population-killers . Our aircraft will destroy any plane or chopper or tank or heavy artillery that moves . Fight if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive form of self-determination . " <p> Why wobble now ?

Simon Grimm hacked out a groan as his spine and shoulders collided with a brick wall . <p> It was midnight . Ivan had tracked the mark from his legal office in downtown Berlin to this ritzy underground parking garage boasting rubber flooring and a heated car wash . <p> " You 've been stealing souls , psychopomp , " Ivan hissed . <p> He clamped both hands to the man 's bony shoulders and pressed his fingertips until he felt the silk business suit tear  --  and then flesh popped . Blood perfumed the air , meaty and more than a little inviting . <p> " Let go of me ! Who the hell are you ? " <p> Ivan dug in deeper . " I 'm your worst nightmare . " <p> " Ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sins of murderers . You do n't scare me . " <p> How the idiot managed such lack of reason  --  so many of his marks acted equally as belligerent  --  never ceased to amaze Ivan . This psychopomp had been moonlighting as a sin eater . Simon Grimm had been stealing souls for years , and Himself wanted it stopped . <p> Grimm kicked , his leather loafer landing on Ivan 's thigh . Though the man was as tall as Ivan , he was slender and was n't designed for defense . Or self-preservation . <p> Slapping the guy hard across the cheek sent him reeling to the ground . He landed ten feet from where Ivan stood , but inches from the license plate of a black BMW claiming SHESMINE . <p> Giving his head a discombobulating shake , Grimm then spat out blood . " Let me guess , Himself sent you . Are you the devil 's fixer ? Should n't you be less GQ and more Demon 's Quarterly ? " <p> " You 're stealing his souls , " Ivan reiterated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted Italian leather jacket . So he liked style . Just because he was a badass did n't mean he could n't look good doing it . <p> Stalking toward the fallen cretin , he fisted his hands . Neck tense , he strained to unmake those fists . <p> Just once . Could I resist just once ? Turn away and run . Leave this wretched psychopomp to a hell of his own making . <p> But his fists remained . Ivan was the psychopomp 's designated hell for the evening . <p> Every time Ivan tried to fight the coercion , it coiled tighter about his will . A boa constrictor wrapped about his very being . Anger over his life boiled in his gut , making escape from the invisible bonds impossible . <p> He was the devil Himself 's fixer . And he hated every second of it . <p> " I 'll never stop ! " Grimm shouted as he shuffled along the wall , spider-long legs scrambling across the rubber-tiled floor , away from Ivan 's relentless approach . <p> Grimm was a soul shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , much like a traffic cop , either to heaven or hell . The official term was psychopomp . Lately , he 'd been directing far too many of Himself 's plunder in the other direction  --  that is , after he 'd eaten away their sins . <p> While Ivan cheered for those unofficially pardoned souls , he also understood the universe functioned thanks to a system of checks and balances . If a soul was intended for Himself , it shifted the universal balance to send it elsewhere . <p> " There 's nothing you can do to me that 'll hurt worse than my life already does , " Grimm slammed out . " Go ahead . Beat me bloody . If I can rescue a soul from the flames , then I will . " <p> Ivan leaned over the shivering psychopomp . " There are no flames , " he said calmly . <p> " How do you know ? Every man conceives his own hell . I say there 's flames ! " <p> Lifting the man until his feet dangled above the rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't struggle because he was exhausted . So it was easy for Ivan to tap into the coercion  --  Himself 's power  --  and conjure a summoning . <p> The shadow on the back of his neck pulsated with what Ivan had come to know as a sort of wickedly macabre pleasure . It acted as an entity apart from Ivan , and yet its roots were planted deep in his being . <p> Focusing his every sense to the psychopomp 's spirit , his very essence , Ivan mined deep for those tendrils of darkness never completely purged after an eating . The man had been eating sins and then sending the newly cleansed sinner on to heaven . Even Ivan disapproved of that . Sinners should know better ; no amount of money could buy their way to heaven , even after their deaths . <p> Ivan felt the heavy darkness rise to the man 's surface , like molecules of sludge bubbling up through the fragile veil of humanity . Sour wickedness tapped at Ivan 's palms , teasing , vying for entrance through the pores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he released the summons , and it flowed from Grimm in a massive black cloud , which instantly surrounded the man , fixing to him like a hungry hive eager for blood . It buzzed over the twitching psychopomp as Ivan held him in the air . Legs kicking , and now shouting bloody murder , Grimm struggled against the vicious darkness he 'd never known he 'd harbored within . <p> Remnants of his client 's stolen sins took their due . <p> When the inhuman shrieks grew hoarse and the man 's body fell limp , Ivan deported the summons . It happened with a sigh from the psychopomp and a prick of icy pain to Ivan 's shadow . He dropped Grimm on the ground and stepped away . <p> Fifty feet away , the exit to the garage opened to the night . Not a single city building blocked the view of the black summer sky . The moon perched high and gorgeous , pale and pocked with mysterious gouges and alien landmarks . Ivan wondered if she were as cold as she looked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good . Or you will know your hell , too . <p> If for a moment , he had to do it , draw his attention away from the task at hand , push out the anger , the coercion . If he did not , then he would be brought down completely , a willing supplicant to Himself . <p> " Never , " Ivan murmured . <p> Punching a fist into his opposite palm , he turned and pressed a booted foot to Grimm 's shoulder , holding him against the wall , for otherwise the man would slump forward and pass out . <p> " Change your mind ? " Ivan asked . <p> Simon nodded . <p> " I did n't hear that . I 've just visited all the sins you 've eaten upon you . They wish to tear away your flesh and pluck out your eyeballs . Every day . I can set them loose again , and they will be bound to you for the rest of your days on this earth . And when you perish , they 'll be waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped up the man by the chin . " You cool with that ? " <p> " No ! " Grimm grasped out , but his hand fell weakly upon his stomach . " I 'll stop , " he muttered . " They all go where they belong from now on . " <p> " Do you swear it ? " <p> " On my mother 's soul . " <p> Ivan winced at the easy wager . Did n't the man understand the weight of his words ? Should he slip up , Himself would snatch his mother 's soul away in a blink . <p> " I 'll be keeping an eye on you . " <p> Ivan pushed away from the man 's shoulder and stepped back . Fear emanated from Simon Grimm in a shivery gray mist . Probably he would never again send a soul the wrong direction . Some men were too weak to challenge a wicked fate . <p> Like you challenge yours during the dark hours ? <p> Exactly . <p> Likely , Grimm had not asked for the job as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , or recruited . He was as much a victim of the world 's whim as any other of the marks Ivan tracked . And for that reason , he could not leave him without one final comment . <p> " May your shadows be cursed . " <p> Ivan strode out from the parking garage . His work was done . <p> For this night . <p> * * * <p> The sun would n't rise for another four hours . Ivan had no other tasks for this evening . He headed home on foot . A small apartment overlooking the river Spree in Berlin offered solace . Perhaps he could manage an hour of sleep . <p> Not that he was tired . The work , it took a lot out of him , strained his body beyond the limits . And that was quite a lot . But the most devastating effects were mental . <p> The night was not his own . Whatever Himself wanted , Ivan did . Reluctantly . Always the compulsion to flee , to escape , was present . But he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task , literally forcing him to it . <p> The more he resisted , the deeper the shadow at the back of his neck dug into his being . It pricked every nerve with an icy bite . Ivan would never become used to such pain . He embodied pain . <p> So he did what he was told . Because his mother 's and father 's souls were held over his head should he refuse . <p> Ivan tracked immortals and mortals alike , those who had made a deal with Himself and had then reneged on that deal . He fixed wrongs and fetched AWOL souls . He was Himself 's fist . And he was feared . <p> But that was not who Ivan Drake was inside , deep in the pockets of spirit where his soul had once resided . <p> " I hate this , " he muttered , as he stepped inside his building and took the four flights of stairs to his apartment in a dash . <p> The steel steps clanked under the thick rubber heels of his biker boots . Artificial lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshen the stale smell of smoke after a rogue fire in the stairwell last month . <p> Some day he would be successful . With determination , he would push beyond Himself 's control and finally be free . <p> Until then , Ivan led two separate lives . The night life and the one he walked during the day . <p> Knocking on the red apartment door next to his , Ivan waited until the door cracked open , then pushed it inside and slipped his hand around the man 's neck . Pulling up the strong body of the thirty-something wrestler , he pierced the pulsing jugular with his teeth and drank . The man did n't fight . He expected this most nights . He was Ivan 's supplicant , provided by Himself . <p> For with the immense release of physical and mental energy and his struggle against fate each night , he developed a desperate thirst . He had to feed the hunger , or die . <p> Dropping the man  --  whose name he refused to learn  --  at his feet , Ivan turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the only sort of blessing he could offer . <p> Leaving the lights off as he entered his apartment , Ivan looked forward to a shower . But the wave of brimstone flowing out from his bedroom put up his hackles . <p> " I hate that smell , " he muttered , and walked toward the intense odor . " You 'd think the Old Lad would try a new cologne after a millennium or two . " <p> The shadow on his back prickled with excited energy . <p> He should be used to these visits , though no more frequent than every other month or so . Himself 's imps usually brought his assignments to him nightly . <p> Stalking into the bedroom , completely dark thanks to the electrochromic window shades , Ivan did n't need artificial light to see the distorted figure that lounged on his bed . <p> And he felt the immense pull in his muscles . The compulsion to submit . He did n't want to . He gripped the door frame , fighting the downward pull . But he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his grasp , Ivan fell onto one knee and bowed his head . Jaw gritted tightly , he fought against the next move , but as usual , he yielded by spitting out , " Master . " <p> " Always so insolent , Drake , even after all these years . Accept your fate . " <p> " Never . " <p> Himself sighed . <p> Though shadowed , Ivan saw the massive horns move before the window shades . Pinpoints of red glowed from the demon 's eyes . The dull clack of hooves as he adjusted his position upon the bed sounded like two blocks of wood . <p> " You punish the psychopomp ? " <p> " He 's stolen his last soul . " <p> " Splendid . Despite your reluctance , you must know how pleased I 've been with your work . You never fail , as much as I know that kills you . " <p> " My suffering serves you even greater satisfaction . " <p> " Oh , indeed . But your complete surrender would finally accomplish my education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . " <p> " So you say . I recall your mother having a smart mouth as well . Look where that got you . " He laughed loud and painfully , but cut off his demented mirth with an abrupt hiss . " So , I 've a new task for you . " <p> " I eagerly await your command . " <p> " Sarcasm does n't suit you , vampire . It is vampire tonight , right ? I can smell the mortal 's blood on you . A nice plump athlete to keep you well fed . " <p> Ivan remained silent . Himself was aware of the fight Ivan put up against the coercion that always made him hungry for blood . To engage in conversation with Himself only served to further vex his spirit , and he knew the bastard always enjoyed that . <p> " I need you to bring me the book , " Himself declared offhandedly , as if announcing a new imp to his legions . " It 's in the United States . Along the coast of Maine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Yes , the book . The Grande Grimoire . ' Nuf said . Details are not important to the jobs you perform . In fact , details only muddy the goal and slow you down . But I will give you an address . " <p> Ivan did appreciate addresses . <p> " Bring it to me posthaste . " Himself rose to stand before Ivan . The heat of his closeness waved off his greasy-slick body like sun off the sand dunes . He bent over Ivan 's bowed head . " Do n't dally , boy . I want it by tomorrow evening . " <p> And the air in the room lightened , as if the humidity had been sucked away by a reverse fan . <p> Ivan used the iron frame at the end of the bed to push up and stand . <p> Another task ? <p> " Just another day at the office . Thanks , Mom and Dad . " <p> He loved his parents . And he did not . <p> " Why the hell did they do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought of his childhood . His parents had never made it a secret his soul belonged to Himself . They 'd hoped to raise Ivan strong and powerful and resistant to Himself 's influence . <p> That was n't easy . <p> Had it been so easy for his parents to sell his soul before he had even been born ? <p> Ivan walked through the sleepy village of Willow Cove . It hugged the Atlantic Ocean along the southern coast in Maine . Granite cliffs and white sand beaches glinted temptingly . A whitewashed lighthouse , easily sighted from anywhere in the small town , transported the more imaginative back a century to a quieter , simpler time . <p> And Willow Cove was quiet and simple . Removed from the popular tourist destinations , this little village had managed to exist untainted by consumerism for centuries . <p> The breezy salted air reminded Ivan of Marseilles , on the coast of France . Much more touristy there , but there were a few secluded gems of beach to be had .
