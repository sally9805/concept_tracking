<p> NEW YORK  --  Do n't get hooked on this fall 's new TV shows too quickly . Some of them wo n't linger long in what some ad executives gripe is the most lackluster fall in recent memory . <p> In the first two weeks of the season  --  Sept. 22 through Oct. 5  --  15 of 26 new network shows that have premiered drew smaller audiences than advertisers expected . That , an exclusive study for USA TODAY shows , could end up costing the networks plenty as they try to compensate advertisers who are getting fewer viewers than they paid for . <p> " It 's not a good fall season start , " says media executive Paul Schulman , who places $ 100 million in TV ad time . " So far , viewers have n't yet awakened to the fact that new shows are on . " <p> Madison Avenue executives say it 's no surprise considering the glut of look-alike situation comedies on the air . <p> " After three or four weeks , I still have to look at the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Sternberg , media researcher at BJK &E; Media . " If I do this for a living and ca n't remember the shows , then the average viewer at home is certainly confused about what 's going on . " <p> Among the study 's findings : <p>  --  Only five new shows on two networks  --  NBC and ABC  --  attracted more eyeballs during the first two weeks of the season than advertisers expected . <p>  --  All seven of the new CBS shows drew smaller audience shares than anticipated . <p>  --  High ad rates are no indicator of success . ABC 's Hiller and Diller commanded the new shows ' third-highest ad rate  --  $ 270,000 for a 30-second commercial  --  but it is the worst ad value of the new shows . Although the sitcom averaged a respectable 17% share of TV sets in use in its time period , advertisers are looking for an average 20% share for the fourth quarter . The Myers Report , a TV industry newsletter that studied the new shows ' ad rates and ratings for USA TODAY , estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each 30-second spot they run if ratings stay where they are . Media buyers say there 's still a chance the comedy , which stars Kevin Nealon and Richard Lewis , will catch on . <p> ABC spokeswoman Anne Riccitelli says there are no plans to retool or reschedule the show , which holds the coveted hammock between hits Home Improvement and NYPD Blue . " The new season takes four to six weeks to settle in , " she says . <p> Advertisers will tell you it 's not how much they pay for network ad time that 's important , it 's how many people are watching their commercials . If a show attracts fewer viewers than advertisers anticipated , then the network must compensate them  --  usually by giving the advertiser additional air time , sometimes called make-goods or audience deficiency units . <p> But networks and advertisers often keep these terms secret . That makes it difficult to determine how the weekly ratings affect network finances . <p> Pay backs nearing <p> Networks will start awarding extra ad time to disappointed advertisers by the first week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Western International Media . <p> Network executives and advertisers are n't panicking yet . Results are in for only two weeks of the new season . During that time , some of the new entries were pre-empted by  --  or forced to compete against  --  the baseball playoffs . <p> Also , advertisers buy their ads in packages that include a plethora of shows . That means viewership shortfalls on some may be offset by bigger-than-predicted audiences for others . <p> What 's more , some good shows are slow to attract viewers . Several much-loved hits , including Cheers and Seinfeld , were n't instant audience-grabbers . Others , such as Naked Truth , are revamped and rescheduled several times before finding a secure prime-time home . A difficult time slot may dog some shows . This season , executives who buy ad time for show sponsors praised The Gregory Hines Show on CBS but say it has been slow to attract an audience because of its Friday evening slot . ABC rules Friday night . <p> But what 's also true is that the big three networks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media analysis of the first two weeks of the season shows viewership of programs on the four big networks was down 5% compared with the same period last year . Basic cable viewership rose 10% . <p> " From a viewing and financial standpoint , the new season is important to all the networks , particularly as they come off a very challenging summer in terms of viewership levels , " says John Rash , director of broadcast negotiations at ad agency Campbell Mithun Esty . <p> Early figures are in <p> Advertisers and their ad agencies viewed the first episodes of the new shows last spring and made most of their buying decisions then . Thirty seconds of commercial time for freshman shows this season ranged from a low of $ 55,000 for ABC 's Nothing Sacred , a controversial drama about an inner-city priest , to $ 400,000 for Veronica 's Closet , an NBC comedy with Kirstie Alley . Both shows are on Thursday night . <p> From advertisers ' perspective , the top two network hits , according to the Myers Report 's study : <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last spring deemed this the fall 's best new entry . So far , the show has delivered a 14% greater audience share than expected . That amounts to a $ 55,172 bonus for each 30-second commercial . <p>  --  Dharma &; Greg ( ABC ) . Advertisers on ABC 's romantic comedy are getting the biggest bonus in audience share  --  20%  --  for their $ 210,000 of 30-second commercial time . That amounts to an ad bonus of $ 42,000 . <p> Among the laggards : <p>  --  Meego ( CBS ) . Viewers love sci-fi shows , but this one , about a 9,000-year-old alien who returns to Earth , is an ad clunker , with a $ 33,462 advertising shortfall per 30-second commercial . <p>  --  Nothing Sacred . The show posted a 27% audience shortfall during the season 's first two weeks . That translates into a $ 15,000 loss on each 30-second commercial , the Myers Report says . The bargain ad rate means advertisers were leery of its competitive Thursday night time slot and program content early on . The show has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League for Religious and Civil Rights , which wants the show killed because it portrays a priest with human temptations and failings . <p> Media executive Rash praises the show but says its lower-than-anticipated following may mean it will be one of the first new shows sacrificed this fall . <p> " In TV , two things are sacred  --  audience and advertiser support , " he says . <p> Network executives beg patience . " It 's important that we do n't get too clouded by the first two weeks of the season , " says Joe Abruzzese , president of CBS ad sales . " Right now , we 're not projecting any make-goods based on what we 're expecting for the quarter . " <p> Networks must tweak or kill new shows when make-goods begin to mount . Even when new shows are less well-received than anticipated , advertisers may benefit from exposure to viewers sampling the show . <p> " Generally , we like advertising on new shows , " says Sears marketing chief John Costello . " Whatever their long-term success , new shows generate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be winners and losers , but the networks have been good partners in working with advertisers who try new shows . " <p> Dean Rotondo , spokesman for General Motors , says GM is pleased with the ad time it secured on Veronica 's Closet and Dharma &; Greg . He says it 's too soon to pass judgment on less popular fall fare . <p> " We evaluate and measure prime-time performance every day , " he says . " But it may be a little early to draw conclusions , because the field is skewed by prime-time baseball , where we 're also advertising . <p> " Look at a show like Brooklyn South , " he says , referring to the CBS police drama . <p> " We recognize in the early going it may not be delivering because it 's going up against ABC 's Monday Night Football and is impacted by baseball . It 's way too soon to declare it a success or failure .

Viewer share is the percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show , as measured by Nielsen Media Research . Projected share is what advertisers expected to be the average for the fourth quarter . Actual share is the average for the weeks of Sept. 22 and Sept. 29 . <p> Advertisers are compensated by the networks when shows fall short of viewership guarantees for the quarter . Compensation most often comes as additional ad time . If a show over-delivers , it 's a bonus to advertisers . Bonus value ( compensation owed ) figures shown here are estimates for 30-second spots .
