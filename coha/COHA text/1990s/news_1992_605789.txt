<p> A jury in 1986 acquitted suspected Mafia leader John Gotti of assault , so the government tried him for racketeering . A jury acquitted him of racketeering , so the government tried him for shooting a union official . A jury acquitted him of the shooting , so the government this week will try him again in New York for racketeering . <p> The string of victories has made the 51-year-old Gotti , the government 's No. 1 organized crime target , the one who got away . He is also an exception . <p> In the past decade , federal mob investigators have convicted 20 bosses of Mafia families and a long string of " underbosses , " as the No. 2 men are known . Even government officials who caution against overconfidence predict that in another decade , La Cosa Nostra , " This Thing of Ours , " will be a thing of the past . <p> " If the pressure is maintained , at the end of 10 years , the mob will be unrecognizable , " said Ronald Goldstock , who heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . <p> " Without a doubt , La Cosa Nostra has been tremendously hurt , " said Jules J. Bonavolonta , former chief of the FBI 's organized crime branch in New York . " Ten years ago , we were losing the war against organized crime . Five years ago , we were holding our own . Clearly now . . . we 're winning the war . " <p> In New York City , where the mob has always been strongest , two of the five families are essentially out of business . A third is nearly beaten . The other two families , the biggest in the country , are weakened but still potent , law enforcement officials said . <p> In Chicago , still considered the Mafia 's second most important stronghold , FBI officials said they have already begun to transfer some agents from investigations of " the syndicate " to street gangs . And prosecutors have dealt serious and in some cases knockout blows to Mafia families in Philadelphia , Kansas City , Cleveland and the Providence-Boston area , federal officials say . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on labor unions , where the Mafia 's threat is considered most insidious . Federal prosecutors believe they have a model for how to reclaim the unions in their 1988 civil racketeering case against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . They convinced a judge that the Mafia had taken over the union and won the establishment of a court-ordered administrator and , eventually , new leadership for the country 's largest union . <p> Still , in New York City , federal officials say Mafia families continue to control important parts of the construction industry , the wholesale seafood market , the distribution of goods from ports , garbage collection and garment manufacturing . In one recent case , prosecutors estimated the Mafia 's practices added $ 1 to the cost of every window installed in New York City . <p> The corruption of unions helps explain La Cosa Nostra 's position as the Justice 's Department No. 1 organized crime target , although federal prosecutors claim other gangs are more violent . The FBI , which for years under Director J. Edgar Hoover denied the Mafia 's existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jim E. Moody , who heads the FBI 's organized crime section . Still , the bureau has reassigned more than three dozen agents from Mafia cases to address the rising threat of Asian gangs . <p> The strategy to cripple the Mafia , fashioned in the early 1980s , relied on four critical tools : the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) to attack the hierarchy of families ; extensive electronic surveillance to penetrate the inner sanctums of families ; civil rackeetering statutes to sever the Mafia from its power base in unions ; and an effective witness protection program . <p> " Twenty years ago , we did a lot of gambling cases . We were able to go into court and show the Mafia was involved in gambling . But their sentences were nothing . We got a lot of convictions and no impact , " said Moody . <p> " Today we aim to take out the whole organization . We put a group of agents on a family , find their lines of communication , use a lot of court-ordered surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those collective illegal acts . We get sentences like 80 years . " <p> The aging of the organizations also helped , because second- and third-generation Americans , facing long prison sentences as Mafia operators , have proved more willing to break omerta  --  the code of silence  --  according to Goldstock and others . Sixteen Mafia members agreed to testify for the government in the past decade , compared to two from 1963 to 1982 , Moody said . <p> In November , Andrew J. Maloney , U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York , landed one of the government 's biggest catches in 46-year-old Salvatore " Sammy the Bull " Gravano . Gravano , who allegedly served as Gotti 's underboss in the Gambino crime family , faced a possible 50-year prison term if convicted of murder and racketeering charges . <p> " The breaking of omerta happens more and more frequently today , because these young members say , ' This is crazy . I 'm not going to jail for the boss , ' " said Maloney . <p> Traditionally , Mafia families have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous pressure from law enforcement has sapped some of the mob 's resilience . After Carmine Persico was sentenced to 100 years in prison for his activities as head of New York 's Colombo crime family , for example , his organization splintered . Members of the two factions are now killing each other in what some law enforcement officials call the most deadly mob war in 30 years . <p> In the Lucchese crime family , New York 's third strongest , defections have snowballed . A " captain " in the family , Peter Chiodo , agreed to cooperate with the government after surviving 12 bullet wounds . Then Alphonse D'Arco , acting boss of the family , became a government witness after learning mob members intended to kill him for bungling Chiodo 's murder , federal officials said . <p> The federal government 's hit list for the Mafia once included nearly 20 cities , but officials say they are close to crossing off Cleveland ; Denver ; Los Angeles ; New Orleans ; Pittston , Pa. ; Rochester , N.Y. ; San Francisco ; San Jose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Cosa Nostra families in New York City , New Jersey , Philadelphia , Chicago , Boston and south Florida , " said Paul Coffey , who heads the Justice Department 's organized crime division . He added that no major Mafia family " has been completely eradicated . " <p> A perennial obstacle is the character of the government 's witnesses  --  perhaps the most unsavory group ever to take the stand . One of last year 's biggest cases fell flat when the jury apparently refused to believe a key government witness who had pleaded guilty to participating in six homicides . <p> All eight defendants were acquitted of the principal charge of running a racketeering enterprise involving bid-rigging and extortion in New York City 's window installation industry . The jury convicted three of the defendants of extortion . <p> The most prominent defendant , Vittorio Amuso , who allegedly runs the Lucchese family , has yet to be tried . Vincent Gigante , reputed boss of New York 's Genovese family , was found incompetent to stand trial . <p> Keeping witnesses alive is another problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness protection program , maintains no witness who followed the program 's rules has been slain . <p> At times , the government itself has made the job harder , with prosecutors and investigators competing for evidence and indictments . Last year , New York state prosecutors accused federal authorities of withholding evidence suggesting Gotti might have sought to tamper with the jury that acquitted him of shooting the union official . Law enforcement sources said federal prosecutors feared disclosure of the evidence would jeopardize their own eavesdropping on Gotti for what they believed would have been an unmakable jury tampering case . <p> The federal government 's last attempt to convict Gotti on racketeering charges provoked a bitter feud between the FBI and the federal prosecutor , who insisted on revealing the identity of an undercover FBI informant . The informant , who had been promised confidentiality by the FBI , was murdered 18 months later . <p> This time , federal prosecutors are coming to court with supposedly flawless tapes from a bug in Gotti 's social club and Gotti 's own top deputy as a star witnesss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gotti is the plumbing salesman he claims to be or the boss of the Gambino family , and the orchestrator of the 1985 slaying of former boss Paul Castellano.
