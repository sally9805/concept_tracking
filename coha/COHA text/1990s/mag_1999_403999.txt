MAKE SURE YOUR NEW RIG IS STILL RUNNING RIGHT AFTER 30 DAYS // Today 's quiz : What 's the most often missed opportunity for new bike buyers ? Judging from my years working in a bike shop , it 's got to be skipping the 30-day check offered by almost all dealers . We 'd sell 1,000-plus bikes a year , yet I doubt even 20% of those folks came in for their 30-day bike checkseven though they were free , and done while they waited . Too bad , because the 30-day check is vital . It takes care of all those little things that happen during the break-in period : Cables stretch , derailleurs stop shifting crisply , spoke tension changes , and bearings loosen . If you ca n't make it back for your free checkup , you just want to do it yourself- or it 's Day 31-the procedure is explained here in eight easy steps . With a few tools ( and a repair stand if you have one ) you can give that scoot the once-over in about an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the bike , apply the front brake and rock the bike fore and aft . Then lift the front wheel six inches and drop it . If you feel play when rocking the bike or hear a clunk from the front end when it 's dropped , the headset bearings have probably loosened . For threadless headsets ( look for a bolt or bolts on the side of the stem ) loosen the stem bolts and snug the allen bolt on top of the stem until play is removed and the fork turns smoothly . Then retighten the stem bolts . For threaded headsets ( no bolts on the stem 's side ) , use headset wrenches to turn the headset cone ( lower nut ) clockwise until play is removed . Then hold the cone while tightening the upper locknut against it to secure the adjustment ( photo ) . Your goal : To have zero play , but still have the headset turn smoothly . Step 2 : Tighten levers and handlebar . Check brake- and shift-lever tightness by trying to turn them on the handlebar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists straight ) . Tighten drop ( road ) levers by sliding an allen wrench beneath the hoods ( photo ) and turning clockwise . Flat bar levers have easy-to-spot clamps . Twist-grip shifters have anchor bolts on the collar that are turned clockwise . And while you 're working near the bar and stem , tighten the handlebar binder bolt in the stem for good measure . Your goal : To prevent loosening and breakdowns . Step 3 : Look for loose spokes . Check for loose spokes by squeezing pairs . Found one ? Double-check by plucking the spokes . On the front wheel , the spoke tones should match . For rear wheels , the spoke tones on the right should match each other and the left spoke tones should match each other . If you find a spoke that sounds dead , it needs retensioning . Simply turn its nipple clockwise ( when it 's at the top of the wheel ) in 1/2-turn increments ( photo ) until its tone matches that of its neighbors . This restores tension without disturbing the wheel . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a shop do the job . Your goal : To restore even tension in the spokes so the wheels stay strong . Step 4 : Check for hub play . Remove the wheels and extract the quick-releases after unscrewing the end nuts . Hold the wheel with two hands while gripping each locknut . Turn counterclockwise to determine if the locknuts have loosened ( they should n't unscrew ) . Then rock the axle side to side to feel for play in the bearings . A bit of play is OK . If there 's lots of play or loose locknuts , use cone wrenches to adjust the bearings and tighten the parts on each side against each other ( photo ) . Your goal : The parts should be tight and the axle should turn smoothly with only a trace of play . Step 5 : Tighten crankarms . This is an important adjustment because if the crankarms loosen and you ride that way , you may ruin the arms-an expensive mistake . Turn the fixing bolts clockwise to snug and secure the arms ( photo ) . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tightness by turning clockwise with a 5-mm allen wrench . ( If you have a triple crankset , do n't forget the bolts securing the small chainring , which are accessed from the back . ) Your goal : To make sure the crankarms stay tight . Step 6 : Boost brake power , Squeeze the brake levers hard . Did the levers bottom out ? Most mountain bikes have adjusting barrels built into the brake levers . Turn them counterclockwise to tighten the brake adjustment . On road bikes , the adjustment barrel is attached to the caliper . Turn the adjusting ring ( it 's usually knurled or has a rubber 0-ring around it ) to tighten the brake adjustment ( photo ) . Your goal : There should be al least an inch between lever and bar when the pads strike the rim . While you 're there , lightly lubricate the brake pivot points . Step 7 : Make it shift right . Put the bike in a repair stand and shift repeatedly . Derailleur cables stretch slightly when new , often causing hesitation when shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn the adjusting barrels ( at the lever , the rear of the derailleur or on the down tube ) counterclockwise in 1/2-turn increments ( photo ) . After each change , check shifting . Your goal : Each lever click should shift the chain one cog.Then lightly lubricate the pivot points and pulleys . Step 8 : Tighten the bolts . Snug the seatpost binder and seat bolts , pedals ( the left is tightened counterclockwise ) , pedal cage screws , brake and derailleur attaching bolts , brake pad bolts , derailleur pulley bolts ( photo ) , front derailleur cage bolt , cable anchor bolts , rear suspension pivot bolts , suspension fork bolts , and all accessory bolts , nuts and screws . Finally , lightly lube the chain , clipless pedals and upper fork legs ( raise the boots first ) . Your goal : To prevent loosening and breakdowns . Photograph Photograph // <p>
