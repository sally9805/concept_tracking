Section : Self-care In the privacy of your bathroom , you can now check everything from your cholesterol level to a co-worker 's drug use . We rate the latest crop of home tests <p> THE PROMISE of home medical testing is deceptively simple : Cut out the medical man . Cut out the lab fees . Heal yourself . There 's no messing with doctors or nurses ; you simply buy a kit and pee or bleed on a shred of chemically treated paper . In seconds , you learn your cholesterol count or blood-glucose level ; in a few days , you know how you 're going to fare in the company drug test . It 's easy , quick and confidential . <p> That 's the idea , anyway . The FDA has approved at least 300 of these over-the-counter self-tests since 1979 . But interpreting the results from some of these kits is far from simple . Worse , the test results can give people false securities  --  or alarms . " These tests are no replacement for a doctor 's diagnosis , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clinical laboratory devices at the FDA . They 're better used to keep tabs on a condition that your doctor has already flagged ( such as high blood pressure ) . If you use a selftest to scan for a serious condition such as diabetes or HIV , follow the test 's directions exactly and make sure you 're mentally prepared for the result . Also , remember that self-tests are n't always reliable , so never make ( or unmake ) treatment decisions without seeing your doctor . <p> Men 's Health staffers looked at dozens of different self-tests and , with the help of experts in various fields , rated them for ease of use , safety and accuracy . If you have special needs or are monitoring a health condition , ask your doctor which test will work best for you ; it might be different from the one we chose . For more information about home tests , see the University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy 's Web site at www.pharm.uky.edu/ hometest/kitshp.html . HIV TEST <p> Home Access HIV-1 Test System , by Home Access Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kit , then call a hotline to activate your anonymous code number and answer automated questions that assess your HIV risk . Next you stick your finger , drop some blood on a card , let it dry for 30 minutes , and seal your sample " in several pouches and envelopes , more secure than Fort Knox , " says our staffer . YOU mail it to the testing lab and call for your results a week later ( or three days later , with the $50 Express version ) . In clinical studies , this test 's accuracy has matched that of professional blood tests . <p> If your sample is HIV-negative , you 'll hear a recorded message , then have the option of talking to a counselor . But if your result is anything other than negative , a counselor answers your call . Which is why this test is so controversial . Your HIV status is critical information , but are you ready to hear this news during a phone call ? <p> Most people who receive disturbing news about their health ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ; they 've already seen a doctor . But some people who casually take this HIV test ( say , to pacify a partner ) might be blindsided by a positive result  --  alone , at 7:38 P.M. , in their kitchen . Home Access reports that , of the people who called in and found that they were HIV-positive , 5 percent hung up immediately . <p> Before you take the test , decide how you want to receive the results . " Some people like to be in the company of a doctor ; others prefer privacy , " says Kathryn Phillips , Ph.D. , of the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California at San Francisco . If you think you 'll handle bad news better if it 's delivered in person , find a doctor you trust and have him do the test . <p> Our user 's result ? The staffer called the hotline , heard a live voice , and stopped breathing . The operator slowly explained that the test card did n't contain enough blood , so the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 seconds of my life , " says the staffer . BLOOD-GLUCOSE MONITORS <p> Men with diabetes and other blood*sugar disorders have used these kits for almost 20 years , to help time insulin shots properly , among other things . <p> Most blood-glucose monitors work in the same way . You prick your finger with a disposable lance , dab a drop of blood onto a testing strip , and insert the strip into an electronic meter that measures how much glucose is in your blood . A reading pops up within a minute . Fancy monitors will store your daily glucose counts for months , giving you a clear picture of how conscientiously you 've been managing your diabetes . <p> " The memory feature is important , because up to 20 percent of patients will fake their numbers when they 're asked to record their daily glucose levels , " says Mayer B. Davidson , M.D. , former president of the American Diabetes Association . It 's one way people avoid a doctor 's lecture  --  even if it puts them at risk for blindness and other maladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked two winners ; we also reviewed a urine test for diabetes . <p> Accu-Chek Complete , by Roche Diagnostics Boehringer Mannheim $115 ; ( 800 ) 858-8072 <p> This simple-looking monitor will cough up a result within 40 seconds , store up to 1,000 readings , automatically figure daily glucose averages and monthlong trends , and upload these data to your doctor 's computer . The AccuChek gave our user consistent readings during repeated tests . <p> Glucometer Dex , by Bayer Corporation $70 ( available in early 1999 ) ; ( 800 ) 445-5901 <p> This disk-shaped monitor is a worthy backup to the Accu-Chek . It 's small enough to take anywhere and , instead of strips , it uses special sensors loaded on replaceable cartridges . You can surrender a drop and receive a reading in 30 seconds . <p> HealthCheck Uri-Test Glucose in Urine Diabetes Screening Test , by Technical Chemicals &; Products , Inc. $10 ; ( 800 ) 482-2907 <p> This test uses a dipstick to screen for glucose in your urine , which is one sign of diabetes . But you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Urine tests can only detect if your glucose is way too high , " he says . See your doctor yearly for a diabetes check ; do n't trust a dipstick . CHOLESTEROL TEST <p> CholesTrak , by ChemTrak $12 for a l-test kit ; ( 800 ) 927-7776 <p> Once you fill the tiny blood reservoir on the thermometerlike device , this test will measure your total cholesterol level within 15 minutes , One staffer received a score that nearly matched a recent professional cholesterol test . He even remarked that his slightly high reading ( 204 mg/dL ) hit him harder this time , be cause the result came in minutes instead of weeks . One drawback : Right now no home test gives separate readings on LDL ( bad ) and HDL ( good ) cholesterol , which are important stats to know . BLOOD-PRESSURE GAUGE <p> Medical Home Blood Pressure Kit , by A &D; $30 ; ( 800 ) 726-9855 <p> We rated blood-pressure gauges back in March 1998 Malegrams , page 44 . Forget the $100 electronic blood-pressure monitors ; the low-tech stethoscope-and-armband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurate . The A &D; gauge performed well for us , but most manual gauges should work as well . A TEST FOR BLOOD IN YOUR STOOL <p> ColoCare , by ChemTrak $8 for 3 pads ; ( 800 ) 927- 7776 <p> About 132,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer this year . One of the early warning signs is blood in your stool , and ColoCare ( and other tests like it ) can scan for it . You just toss a small pad into the toilet bowl and wait a few minutes to see if it turns green or blue-which is a hell of a lot easier than what we thought this test was going to entail . <p> But your best shot at surviving colon or rectal cancer is to catch it early . And that 's where these tests fall short . " This kind of test is not as reliable or as accurate at detecting early-stage cancer or precancerous growths as the tests your doctor can do , " says Robert Smith , Ph.D. , director of cancer detection at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease that you should try to diagnose by yourself . If you 're over age 50 ( or younger , if you have a family history ) , schedule a colon-cancer workup as part of your annual exam . A TEST FOR BLOOD IN YOUR URINE <p> EZ Detect Hidden Blood in Urine , by Biomerica $8 ; ( 800 ) 854-3002 <p> If the pads on the dipstick change color , there 's blood in your urine , which can be a sign of a bladder infection or prostate problems . If you do n't see any blood when you urinate , or you do n't have any other obvious symptoms-like lower-abdominal pain  --  there 's no reason to suspect trouble , says pathologist Linda Trapkin , D.O. , of Community General Hospital in Syracuse , New York . However , if you do pee blood for no apparent reason ( even strenuous running can harmlessly taint your urine for a day ) , you should immediately head to a doctor , not a drugstore . VISION TEST <p> HealthCheck Vision Screening Test , by Technical Chemicals &; Products , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes inane eye-chart drills you perform while wearing an eye-patch , using your naked eye , or looking through a pinhole . Frankly , we could n't see any reason to drop 10 bucks for this . " If my vision is blurry when I read the newspaper , why do I need to buy this test ? " asks Jeffrey L. Weaver , O.D. , director of the American Optometric Association 's clinical care center . " More important , this test does n't check the health of your eyes  --  and there are some health problems , such as diabetes or macular degeneration , that can cause visual disturbances . " If billboards are becoming fuzzy , head to an eye doctor . This eye-chart test wo n't tell you a damn thing you do n't already know . PATERNITY TEST <p> DNA Paternity Screen Test , by Affiliated Genetics $325 plus $5 shipping ; ( 801 ) 298-3366 ( mail-order only ) <p> Swipe a swab inside the red-haired love child 's cheek , take similar samples from his mother 's mouth and yours , and then mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five weeks , you 'll know with 99 percent probability if he 's your kid . Attention NBA players ( and cheerleaders ) : This test is n't admissible in court , because samples are collected at home . But for $330 , you 'll know whether a $3,000 DNA test will swing your way . DRUG TEST <p> Home drug tests have three controversial uses : ( 1 ) prying into your kid 's life to make sure he 's clean ; ( 2 ) prying  --  quite illegally  --  into your friends ' and co-workers ' lives for any reason you want ; and ( 3 ) checking your own urine , to see if those poppy-seed bagels you ate will cost you the judgeship . <p> PDT-90 , by Psychemedics Corporation $60 ; ( 800 ) 800.5447 <p> Send in a lock of the suspected drug user 's hair , and five days later , call Psychemedics to find out if the person has taken marijuana , cocaine , opiates , methamphetamines , or PCP during the last three months . The other drug tests we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of drug use only in the preceding few days , and secrecy is a bit tougher to pull off : " Axl , would you mind peeing in this cup ? "  --  Research by Kerry Holland <p> THE TEST IS YET TO COME <p> These home tests should hit pharmacies soon . We 'll keep you posted Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) <p> The EZ-PSA by Biomerica , a finger-prick blood test , will detect PSA levels that put you at high risk for prostate cancer . It 's available in Europe now and , with FDA approval , the EZ-PSA should be available in the United States within three years . Sperm viability <p> If the home pregnancy tests keep coming up empty , the FertilMARO test will reveal if you 're the problem . Mix your semen sample with dye ; if it turns blue , you have at least 20 million sperm per milliliter ( you fertile guy ) . This $10 test should land in drugstores by April 1999 . Hepatitis C <p> As with the Home Access HIV test , you 'll mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you scored positive for hepatitis C , which affects 4 million Americans . If the FDA approves the test , it 'll be available by early 1999 . HIV urine test <p> Think of the home HIV-testing process minus the bloodletting . Send the Calypte Biomedical Corporation a urine sample and then call an 800 number for the verdict and counseling . The FDA has approved the process for doctors ' offices and labs , so we could see the drugstore kit , by 2000 . HDL cholesterol <p> A finger-stick blood test from Technical Chemicals &; Products , Inc. , will tell you whether your total and HDL cholesterol fall within normal , medium-risk , or high-risk ranges . If the FDA gives its blessing , the test should be available next year .  --  Research by Brian Good <p> <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> BY RON GERACI <p>
