<p> Jack Durrance might awe the average person with his accomplishments . <p> His exceptional talents and hard work have brought him international praise - in medicine , in which he is an expert in lung disease ; in botany , in which he hybridized more than 30 varieties of iris , including one named for him ; and in mountain climbing , in which he has been perhaps the nation 's premier rock climber . <p> But his success also brought him cruel pain - the condemnation from a group of his peers that he had caused the death of four fellow mountain climbers on K2 , the second-highest mountain and most difficult ascent in the world , 56 years ago . <p> Characteristically , Durrance chose to walk away from his critics , and he never said a word in his defense during all the time that has passed . <p> What might have been a life of enviable achievement and contribution had one dark cloud in it that would n't go away . <p> That is , until last year . <p> Finally , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the 1939 climb of K2 that not only exonerated Durrance but blamed the expedition 's leader , Fritz Wiessner , the very man whose accusations had dogged Durrance all these years . <p> Finally , the ghosts of a lifetime were banished . <p> " I knew I was not responsible for those men dying . But I never felt I could argue against Wiessner , " Durrance , 83 , said recently from his east Denver home . " I never felt anyone would listen to me . " <p> Early in the spring of 1939 , 19 men left Srinagar , Kashmir , on a 300-mile walk into one of the harshest environments in the world , performed superhuman feats of courage and endurance at altitudes unfit for humans , then gradually succumbed to illness , diseases , accidents , frostbite and finally death . <p> Only two of the Americans are alive today - Durrance and Chappell Cranmer , who lives in Granby and is a minister in the Fraser Valley . <p> Durrance in his day was unparalleled in mountain climbing , establishing numerous first ascents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He had been tapped as a last-minute substitute to join the first American expedition to attempt 27,250-foot K2 . The leader was Wiessner , a German ex-patriot living in Stowe , Vt . <p> After walking for six weeks up the Baltoro Glacier to the base of K2 , the party established a base camp at 16,500 feet . <p> Cranmer , son of prominent Denverite George Cranmer , who founded the Red Rocks Amphitheater and the Winter Park ski area , had been considered one of the team 's strongest members . But at the base camp , he became gravely ill - " coughing up mush , " Durrance wrote in his diary - and nearly died . <p> Durrance administered artificial respiration for two hours . Cranmer developed diarrhea , then lost all bodily control . " I never knew anyone could be so sick and stay alive , " Durrance said . " I 've practiced pulmonary medicine for over 35 years I 've never had a worse patient than my first one , Chap Cranmer . " <p> Once on the mountain , Wiessner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wiessner 's who offered to finance the expedition in exchange for being included , was inexperienced , out of shape and overweight . Yet Wiessner chose Wolfe to join him for the assault on the summit . <p> Durrance , meanwhile , was relegated to supporting the party up high . Over the next 42 days , Durrance lugged heavy loads of food and equipment up the mountain 21 times , climbing a total of 28,200 vertical feet . His old , leaky , almost unserviceable boots now are mounted on Durrance 's kitchen wall . <p> Once Wiessner reached 25,300 feet and established Camp VIII , events unfolded rapidly . Wolfe was losing strength , so Wiessner and a Sherpa tried for the summit , coming within 800 feet . <p> Meanwhile , Wiessner had been gone so long that Tony Cromwell , the expedition 's second in command , believed he had died . So Cromwell ordered Durrance to strip the upper camps of salvageable supplies and return to base . <p> Wiessner and the Sherpa , still alive but forced to retreat for more supplies , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then descended to the next camp . They found it had been stripped , so they descended to the next camp , only to find the same . Desperately cold and tired , the two made their way through the night down to 19,300 feet before finding sleeping bags and food . Finally , the exhausted men arrived at base camp . <p> By now , only Wolfe remained on the mountain , at 24,700 feet . The three strongest Sherpas left base camp to retrieve him . No one returned , and the bodies never were found . <p> Perhaps an avalanche took them out . Perhaps Wolfe slipped while roped to the Sherpas and dragged them all over a precipice . <p> At the base camp , Wiessner angrily criticized Cromwell for stripping the camps . Had he found supplies at a higher camp , Wiessner argued , he could have reached the summit and brought Wolfe back with him . <p> The American Alpine Club investigated and issued a bland , blameless report . <p> But years later , Wiessner changed his mind and published an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Durrance , well into his medical profession and believing that the expedition had been overanalyzed , never rebutted Wiessner 's story , even though he was furious . <p> " I asked myself , ' What good is it going to do to start rebutting it ? Why rebut somebody would look into it and get the real story . " <p> Many in the tight-knit climbing community , hearing nothing from Durrance , took Wiessner 's word for what went wrong . But still , there were doubts , recalled Steve Knowlton , an early Colorado ski pioneer and an owner of the Buckhorn Exchange ( Denver liquor license #1 ) . <p> " I 've always been fascinated by the fact that no one would talk about the climb of 1939 , " said Knowlton , who knew practically everyone in the climb , including Durrance , Cranmer and Wiessner , and Wolfe 's widow Alice . " Even Jack 's brother , Dick , would n't talk about it . " <p> Durrance got on with his life . He continued to climb , making several important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would duplicate for 40 years . Even today , climbers with profoundly better equipment talk of the difficult " Durrance routes " throughout the Rockies . <p> After Durrance graduated from medical school , Jean Cranmer , grateful to Jack for saving her son 's life , secured him an internship in Denver under Dr. James J. Waring , an international expert on tuberculosis . <p> He married his fiancee , Stella , in 1947 , then bought the house that they still live in , five kids later . After his internship , he went to work at the VA Hospital , the only job he would ever hold and from which he retired in 1978 . Until recently , he voluntarily scanned the chest X-rays at Denver General Hospital each week looking for signs of tuberculosis . <p> Durrance was notorious for his orneriness and irreverence . He frequently would take medical students on " red " trips , where they innocently would have a red beer at the College Inn near the CU medical school , decide to have another at the Red Ram in Georgetown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Aspen . And who else would name their kids Worm , Bird , Ant , Yum Yum and Dee Dee ? <p> He has always been a lover of fast cars , once owning a Mercedes Benz Gullwing . Even today , in his 80s , he boasts that no one can beat him to the Eisenhower Tunnel in his new Lexus . <p> If climbing was Durrance 's early passion , his life-long passion has been flowers . He began growing gladioluses , then roses and tulips . <p> He then switched to irises and became one of the leading hybridizers in the country . <p> " We introduced his new irises . He must have 30 or so new varieties he 's introduced , " said Ev Long of Long 's Gardens in Boulder , who has climbed Longs Peak ( no relation ) 96 times . Durrance , who has more than an acre of irises in the garden around his house , also owns 4 acres , all planted with irises , near Orchard , north of Denver . He became chairman of the American Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was chairman of three national conventions held in Denver . He has an iris named for him - the Jack R.D. <p> Then , six years ago , fate took up the cause Durrance himself refused to fight . <p> William L. Putnam , a former president of the American Alpine Club , and Andy Kaufman , a former director , began researching a biography of Wiessner , expecting to memorialize " our friend and teacher . " <p> They found so many holes in Wiessner 's story about K2 that they focused on that one expedition . Eventually , they asked Durrance for his diary , which had never been consulted before . They also located some film footage shot during the expedition , which also had not been used in any previous investigations . <p> The two researchers rewrote some important mountaineering history . <p> Their book , " K2 : The 1939 Tragedy . The Full Story of the Ill-Fated Wiessner Expedition , " took the world climbing community by surprise . <p> They concluded that their old friend Wiessner , through poor judgment and incompetence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His obsession with reaching the summit , they concluded , put the expedition in jeopardy . <p> Durrance was vindicated . <p> Typically , it took someone else to tell his story .
