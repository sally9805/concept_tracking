At 34 , Michael Jackson is still the world 's most fragile child star . When he was 11 , the Cupid and Kewpie doll of the Jackson 5 , he had three No. 1 hits . He did O.K. on his own too : the two best-selling albums in history ( Thriller and Bad ) and a contract with Sony Entertainment valued at a billion dollars . For most of the ' 80s , long before anyone felt compelled to dub him the King of $ Pop , he was that and more . <P> Yet , as he revealed in his 90-minute TV chat last week with talk-show empathizer Oprah Winfrey , Jackson is at heart as vulnerable as the handicapped children he generously welcomes to his ranch near Santa Barbara , California . He calls it Neverland , an allusion to his status as pop 's Peter Pan . But Jackson may feel more kinship with another English outsider , John Merrick  --  that sweet-souled , tragically deformed creature , the Elephant Man . " I love the story , " he told Winfrey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made me cry because I saw myself in the story . " <P> Jackson can cry out loud ; that is his agony ( displayed to Winfrey ) and his art ( in performance ) . These days he is doing both : the world 's most reclusive exhibitionist  --  or most exhibitionistic recluse  --  is everywhere . For the Clinton Inauguration , he led an all-star reunion of his 1985 We Are the World chorale . He spurred the Super Bowl to the largest U.S. TV audience ever , supervising a 98,000-person flash-card promotion for his Heal the World charity for inner-city children . He appeared at the N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards and the American Music Awards ceremonies . <P> Cynics can find a reason for this . He is no longer , quite , Michael Jackson . The Thriller album sold 21 million domestic copies ( and 27 million more worldwide ) ; Dangerous , his latest set , has trudged along at 4 million since its release in November 1991 . In a Los Angeles Times survey of music moguls , Jackson ranked just 14th on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Last year , according to Forbes , he made less money than Winfrey ( $51 million to $88 million ) . <P> Pop music is a fickle muse ; anyone can lose the knack . But Jackson lost touch . Not as a performer  --  his falsetto and his footwork still dazzle  --  but with his audience . His career went stratospheric , and he went extraterrestrial . He seemed like one of the exotic animals he keeps in his backyard habitat . For some imaginary Madame Tussaud 's , he transformed himself into his own waxed , blanched figure . <P> Last week Jackson tried for mass-media redemption and went megaplatinum . Part grand Oprah , part soap Oprah , the Winfrey show was at the very least great TV : live , reckless , emotionally naked . For his first television interview in 14 years , Jackson won a huge audience  --  the largest , excluding Super Bowls , in a decade  --  and a forum to counter some of the zanier rumors that have swirled around him . He rebutted the charge that he sleeps in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually showed him , he said , testing equipment at a burn center he founded after being " burned very badly " while shooting a 1984 Pepsi spot .
