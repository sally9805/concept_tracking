After steadily losing altitude , not to mention money  --  $13 billion between 1990 and 1994  --  the airline industry has been getting whole and then some . Last year the airlines posted a record $5.2 billion profit , up from $3.9 billion in 1996 , and industry watchers expect earnings to climb to $5.4 billion this year . Passenger loads , averaging 70% , are at their highest in five decades . Alas , profits seem to be inversely proportional to passenger comfort . How else can you explain jumbo jets equipped with the smallest of seats ? <P> That 's why the alliance between Northwest and Continental , announced last week , will probably improve the ride for the two companies more than for their passengers . In the unorthodox agreement , Northwest will buy 14% of Continental 's common shares  --  but 51% of the company 's voting shares  --  effectively creating a domestic and international network to compete with megacarriers like United and American . The Continental shares are being sold by Air Partners , controlled by investor David Bonderman . Continental was operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partners and Air Canada ( which since sold its shares ) each invested about $50 million to lift the carrier out of bankruptcy . Last week Air Partners sold its remaining shares for $519 million . The alliance will boost Northwest and Continental 's U.S. market share to a combined 16.8% , on par with United , American and Delta Air Lines . <P> More important , the Northwest-Continental link may represent the end of an era of chaos that began with deregulation in 1978 . Midsize carriers such as U.S. Airways are viewed as ripe for merger . " In a mature industry , if you want growth you have to acquire your neighbor or form an alliance , " explains Kevin Murphy , an analyst at Morgan Stanley , Dean Witter , Discover . " And that 's what they 've done . " <P> Although Continental is remarkably profitable for a company that practically made bankruptcy court a scheduled stop , CEO Gordon Bethune did not want to be left behind in this latest strategic go-around . " If we are successful , and I think we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the industry consolidates . " <P> Under the plan , the carriers will merge their route networks and frequent-flyer programs but keep separate corporate identities and management teams . Passengers stand to get a wider array of flight options from nearly every locale , from Latin America to Asia . The alliance , still subject to regulatory approval , is expected to add some $500 million in revenue three years after implementation by capturing passengers who would otherwise have changed to another airline while making a connection . " Airlines are looking for ways to maximize revenues with existing resources , " says Michael Boyd , president of the Boyd Group , a consulting firm in Evergreen , Colo . " In this case , both get incremental revenue at a minimal cost . " <P> The two companies also get the critical mass needed to compete with the aviation blocs created by American and United . The two majors each stitched together a quilt of global partnerships that could potentially outmaneuver smaller carriers like Continental and Northwest , if left to their own devices . Just last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached , opening up significant competition to Northwest 's profitable Asian routes . American and United are expected to ink partnerships with major Japanese carriers .
