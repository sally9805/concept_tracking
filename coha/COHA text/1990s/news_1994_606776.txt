<p> President Clinton returns to Washington today with the broad outlines of a strategy to resurrect his presidency that is based in part on hopes that the Republicans will look so radical they will scare America away and in part on moving himself back into the political center . <p> The move to the political mainstream , his aides say , will focus on a new effort to cut middle-class taxes and government spending in his 1996 budget , a " reform agenda " that encompasses welfare and campaign finance and , perhaps , a broad admission to the nation that some of his proposals were misguided . <p> As Clinton relaxed in Hawaii last week , senior aides engaged in what one called " door-to-door , wall-to-wall " debates over what the president should do . <p> Interviews with several aides found little disagreement that Clinton 's hope for political survival lies in what one outside Democratic adviser called " recapturing the center in a decisive , firm and solid manner that reinstills the nation 's belief in him and his presidency . " <p> But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a major image makeover , Clinton himself was illustrating how tricky and perilous even small elements of that effort could be . Asked about a constitutional amendment on school prayer being proposed by the GOP , Clinton answered by stressing his belief in voluntary school prayer and his openness to the idea of amending the Bill of Rights . <p> Representatives of the old Democratic coalition reacted in what White House aides said was a flood of angry and alarmed phone calls and letters . <p> " Democrats should defend cardinal principles that have inspired the loyalty of Jewish voters to Democratic candidates in election after election . A retreat ... could gravely undermine the decades of trust built between American Jews and the Democratic Party , " said one typical letter , from the National Jewish Democratic Council . <p> The letter made clear that Jewish voters  --  75 percent to 80 percent of whom consistently vote Democratic  --  expect the president to toe the line . The White House quickly walked Clinton away from a prayer amendment , but the effort illustrated that trying to keep one foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other is a feat of political gymnastics that if executed badly can only worsen Clinton 's credibility problems . <p> Senior administration officials said last Friday that the Clinton budget is being revamped to meet the reality of a Republican Congress and an electoral repudiation . While the president has made no decisions , his advisers are amenable to a middle-class tax cut of $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion ; additional spending cuts beyond the ones required by last year 's budget agreement ; and a package of welfare , political and modest health care reform proposals . <p> Exactly how the administration might define the middle class is unclear . In the 1992 campaign , aides said that families earning less than $ 100,000 a year would get some relief . Clinton put the tax cut aside after the election to achieve more budget deficit reduction . <p> Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Friday said the administration agrees on the " desirability " of a middle-class tax cut but that it must be paid for in either spending cuts or revenue increases elsewhere in the fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also have a group of tax cuts on their budget platter , and yesterday outgoing House majority leader Richard A. Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) said he could support some tax cuts . <p> The political dynamics , aides agree , make such a Clinton proposal likely . The White House hopes to use the tax-cut issues to draw the distinction that Democrats will pay for theirs with legitimate , responsible budgeting while the Republicans will not . <p> White House officials acknowledge their fiscal proposals are likely to be shredded by the Republicans and their budget is likely to end up as more of a political outline of where the president stands than an actual guide to budget reality . But one official said the budget debate will be one piece of solid ground for Clinton to stand on to reshape his image with " a centrist approach to the nation 's business that can be contrasted with their radical , unpaid-for approach . " <p> Officials are beginning the process of assembling a package of further spending cuts , facing one of the few silver linings that the clouds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional chairmen who resisted Clinton efforts to trim and reorder domestic spending his first two years in office . <p> California 's Republican governor , Pete Wilson , a former member of Congress who watched Clinton 's decline in his state , said Friday that Clinton 's " real problem is he has to do things that will develop a different attitude on the part of the American people " toward him . Wilson said Clinton has " a better chance to do that with a new Republican Congress than he had with the old one . " <p> The president 's fundamental problem , Wilson said , " is people do not trust him " because he came to Washington as a new kind of fiscally careful Democrat averse to big new programs and strayed , or was pulled , from that posture . <p> Moving back to his starting ground will be a gargantuan task , but White House aides hope the Republicans will give Clinton a boost . <p> Aides reacted this week not with dismay but almost glee as new Republican leaders unleashed a string of conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) said orphanages and private charity rather than welfare may be the route to protecting poor children , and he called for a school prayer constitutional amendment . Sen. Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) said that Clinton is " unfit " to be commander in chief . A variety of GOP leaders said that they will investigate an assortment of activities in the executive branch during the past two years . <p> " People are going to look at this parade of school prayer and antiabortion stuff and one investigation after another and say , ' That 's not what we bought into , ' " said one Clinton aide . " Concentrating on social issues rather than reducing the size of government and " cleaning up the mess in Washington , " said another Clinton aide , could be to Republicans what gays in the military and the large health care proposal was to Clinton  --  intrusions on the main voter agenda that lose the centrist independent voters . <p> " I know they would love to believe that , " Wilson said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are going to be in a minority for a long , long time . " <p> Republicans maintain , in addition , that the Clinton team has moved so far to the liberal side of the political spectrum that its members do not understand where the nation thinks the center is . " They are totally out of touch , " Rich Bond , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , said in an interview . " There is a spiritual wasteland out there , " and the huge new class of Republicans coming into office know that , he said . He said Republicans will craft a cultural agenda that responds to national concerns about the decline of American values . <p> Bond , who as a GOP leader said he had " experienced firsthand " the zealousness of some of the " extreme conservatives , " agreed that efforts seen by the nation as " some sort of religious jihad " would harm his party , but he predicted that Gingrich and House Republicans are smart enough to not overreach . <p> Although they were awash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no alternative , are now trying to move on , but gallows humor still pervades the upper ranks . Late last week , as State Department senior aides began preparing the traditional " welcome home " memo for Secretary of State Warren Christopher , who has been overseas since before the election , one senior aide suggested the following should be included : <p> " Dear Mr. Secretary : While you were away , we got the crap kicked out of us at the polls . The GOP is now in control and you will be appearing before Jesse Helms next January . Other than that , not much . "
