<p> The bones of Ernesto ( Che ) Guevara lie buried deep in some secret Bolivian mountain grave , but the mythic image of the revolutionary has been resurrected like an antique 60 's political slogan : " Che vive . " <p> His defiant voice lives on in the pages of five new biographies and in six movies and documentaries now in preparation , including one with Mick Jagger as executive producer . His political passion is the inspiration for Bolivian death-march tourism to sites like La Higuera , the poor mountain hamlet where he was executed at age 39 by the Bolivian military in October 1967 . <p> On top of that , the Communist rebel chief 's characteristic beard , beret and fatigues have inspired a Che look-alike contest designed to sell skis . " We felt that the Che image  --  just the icon and not the man 's doings  --  represented what we wanted : revolution , extreme change , " said Jim Fleischer , assistant product manager for Raichle Molitor U.S.A. , the New York distributor of Fischer 's Revolution skis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to Fidel Castro , lofty dreams of international guerrilla movements and an armed struggle against capitalism have faded with the passing of the cold war . But his image has become more vivid , complex and commercial . Guevara 's evolution from poster warrior for the revolution to contemporary pop icon is in large part tied to the anniversary of his death . In Cuba , there is a yearlong commemoration of the " 30th Anniversary of the Death in Combat of the Heroic Guerrilla and His Comrades . " But even the Cubans are stumped by the dimensions of his popularity in other countries , and some take a dim view of commercial exploitation of his name . <p> One can speculate about more profound reasons for the Che revival  --  a yearning , perhaps , for uncompromising charismatic heroes who symbolize self-sacrifice , idealism and rebellion . It also does not hurt that Guevara died young , and looked glamorous in his beret . Time has softened his image from that of a rebel with a cause to a rebel with a heart . The dust jackets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a Che clutching a cigar than one holding a carbine . Posters have evolved from the classic visage of a glaring guerrilla to a comrade cuddling a puppy . <p> " As the possibility of real political change recedes , people do need symbols of resistance ; it makes them feel better , and Che is that par excellence , " said Colin Robinson , the managing director of Verso , a publishing house based in New York and London that specializes in radical literature . " Yes , he was handsome . Yes , he died young . But I would say more important than any of those things , he was a rebel . " <p> Last year Verso created an unexpected hit for itself by publishing Guevara 's youthful diaries of his 1951 motorcycle journey on a cranky Norton in South America , a vagabond odyssey well fueled with red wine . The book , " The Motorcycle Diaries , " has gone through four printings , selling 50,000 copies for a house accustomed to printing and selling an average of 5,000 books . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sympathetic human being , " Mr. Robinson said . " That image is the one that we 've tried to project  --  someone up for a good time , but also a very warm , decent human being . " <p> To promote the gentler Guevara , Verso originally circulated posters of him licking an ice cream cone and gave the book a dust jacket blurb saying " ' Das Kapital ' meets ' Easy Rider . ' " The book continues to sell steadily without any concerted marketing campaign , benefiting from bursts of new publicity like Antonio Banderas 's star turn as a celluloid Che in the movie " Evita , " or the publication of an 800-page biography by Jon Lee Anderson called " Che Guevara : A Revolutionary Life , " issued this month by Grove Press . <p> " When I first started the book in 1990 , everyone thought it was an interesting idea , " Mr. Anderson said . " My idea was that they had plundered all the other icons of the 60 's , and here was this great romantic figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now . Guevara 's life has also been picked over in in two new biographies by French authors , Jean Cormier and Pierre Kalfon . In the fall , Alfred A. Knopf is publishing " Companero : The Life and Death of Che Guevara. " by the Mexican political scientist and writer Jorge G. Castaneda , and St. Martin 's Press is offering " Guevara Also Known as Che , " by Paco Ignacio Taibo 2d , a Mexican novelist better known for crime fiction . <p> Mr. Jagger 's film project is an espionage thriller exploring Guevara 's relationship with Tamara Bunke , called Tanya , an East German who died in Bolivia in their ill-fated guerrilla campaign . <p> Mr. Anderson 's biography has been optioned for a movie by Chris Gerolmo , who wrote the script for " Mississippi Burning " and will direct and write the Guevera screenplay . " If their movie is a movie about the romance between Che and Tanya , " said Laura Bickford , the producer on the project , " then ours is a romance about Che and Fidel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three years in Havana poring over diaries saved by Guevara 's widow , Aleida March , who presides over La Casa del Che , a small research center in their old home . There , Guevara 's office is carefully preserved , his Formica-topped desk and army backpack intact . <p> In his book , he tracks Guevara 's metamorphosis from a pragmatic Argentine medical student who joined a Peronist youth group so he could use its library to an idealistic Maoist rebel who joined with Mr. Castro to oust the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista . Mr. Anderson also explores the sometimes tense relationship between Mr. Castro and Guevara , including a pathetic portrait of Guevara 's failed 10-month military campaign in Bolivia , where he has traveled secretly at Mr. Castro 's urging . <p> Weakened by asthma , his clothes in rags , unable to march without assistance , Guevara led a small column of exhausted Cuban and Bolivian guerrillas on a challenge to the Bolivian Government . They were hampered by hunger and squabbles over their conditions , and bewildered by the lack of support from peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guevara , in Mr. Anderson 's account , faced execution after his capture by the Bolivian military and interrogation by a Central Intelligence Agency agent , his rebellious spirit endured to his last words : " Shoot , coward , you are only going to kill a man . " <p> Among the new books , Mr. Castaneda 's work is expected to be the most critical of Guevara 's relationship with Mr. Castro , which has long been a source of conspiracy theories about Guevara 's death . " I think Che goes to Africa and Bolivia because Fidel sells him these two bridges , " Mr. Castaneda said . " He did n't want him in Cuba , but he did n't want him dead . So he basically invented Africa and Bolivia for him . " <p> As a student at Princeton University , Mr. Castaneda decorated his dorm room with a poster of Che , his glowering face superimposed over a map of South America . Guevara 's popularity today , he suggests , has little to do with his political views . <p> " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum of other ideas and causes , " Mr. Castaneda said , " and Che is a symbol of the 60 's . " <p> The icon takes many forms . A limited edition of Swatch watches with Guevara 's image was issued two years ago . Rock bands have invoked his image with interpretations as diverse as their music . To the Spanish group Boikot , which is releasing a compact disk next month called " La Ruta del Che , " Guevara represents a universal concept of revolution . " I believe we all carry a Che inside us , a way of making our own revolution , " a band member told the newspaper El Pais . <p> Rage Against the Machine , the American rock group , released a single called " Bombtrack " last year with Che 's image and tours with a Guevara banner draped behind it onstage . The cover of its latest album , " Evil Empire , " features a pile of books including Guevara 's handbook for guerrilla tactics . <p> At the University of California in Los Angeles , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will display almost 200 Guevara posters and artwork he has collected in the decades since the rebel 's death . <p> " If you go to Havana today , you will not see him with a gun , " Mr. Kunzle said . " You will see him with a rose , a dove . He 's become the Gandhi of Cuba .. " <p> To Mr. Kunzle , Guevara offers an alternative message of hope for those born long after his death , people who have been taught to believe that with the collapse of socialism and Communism , " there is no alternative to capitalism . " <p> The exhibition will include artworks with a critical view of Guevara as well as Che ashtrays and a curtain strung with colored beads that form his face . <p> As for the Cuban view of all this , " We have always been against any commercial use of his image , " said Jose Borges , a spokesman for the Cuban Mission to the United Nations . " One thing is to promote his image and his example , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more money . " <p> In Cuba as well , " a lot of people are investigating , trying to show the people what he really did , what his example means for the Cubans , " Mr. Borges said . " But really , I do n't know if there is any special cause for all of these books . "
