Gun rebluing is one of the easiest  --  and most satisfying  --  of the many home gunsmithing jobs you might attempt . As with any amateur project , the results of home bluing , commonly called " cold " or " instant " processes , can be thoroughly professional-looking . But they can also be mediocre or downright bad . It 's these bad jobs , streaked and pallid , that spark the occasional criticisms . of cold bluing . Such judgments remind me of the bald guy who said he 'd never wear a toupee because " they do n't look natural . " Home blue jobs are like toupees in that only the bad ones are easily spotted . The really good jobs blend and cover so naturally that no one knows . You 'll find that there are all sorts of instant blues , browns , blacks , grays , and even " Parkerizing " ( a rust-inhibiting phosphate finish ) products available , most of which bear such respected labels as Birchwood Casey or Brownells . Both supply houses offer a selection of liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots on the tang of a shotgun where the safety has rubbed to blending larger areas where the gun rack in your pickup wore away the original color to full-cover jobs on a variety of metals . There are , in fact , so many options that the beginner may have trouble selecting the best process for the job at hand . Which is why we selected three different types of home blues for step-by-step demonstrations . In addition to the cold chemical blue , the most common process for full bluing or touch-up jobs , there is a simple spray-on lacquer finish . More a paint job than real bluing , it 's oven-baked for added toughness . A third process , using so-called Belgian blue , might be called a hot process , but it is n't the hot caustic-salt type used by professional rebluers , which requires expensive equipment . Instead , it is an accelerated version of the normally slow and tedious rust-bluing method used on the finest guns . ( Incidentally , Belgian bluing is a term adopted originally by the Herters Company , probably to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and quality . ) The result is so deep and rich that it 's almost like looking into a pool of black steel . It is especially recommended for refinishing the barrels of double guns that are joined with soft solder , which caustic bluing may dissolve , causing barrels and ribs to separate . All three processes can be highly successful , and with each you 'll find that the actual bluing is the easiest part . The secret to success in home bluing is the effort and care put into preparing the metal . And that 's why you will be the main ingredient in your project , no matter which method you use . To demonstrate the bluing methods on the following pages , we chose a Stevens Model 1894 Favorite rifle , which shows a century 's worth of rough treatment ; an all-aluminum Remington Model 700 BDL floorplate assembly ; and a Winchester Model 700 floorplate and trigger assembly that has been restyled and streamlined for a custom look . The bluing kits and preparations we used are inexpensive and available at most gun shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies can be ordered from Brownells Inc. , RR2 Box 1 , Montezuma , IA 50171 ( 515-623-5401 ; fax : 515-623-3896 ) , and from Birchwood Casey Company , 7900 Fuller Rd. , Eden Prairie , MN 55344 ( 612-917-7933 ; fax : 612-937-7979 ) . For our demonstration of cold chemical bluing we grabbed the tiger 's tail and gave it a hard yank by violating a cardinal rule of antique-gun preservation : Thou shalt reblue no ancient or venerable firearm . But reblue we did , as the pictures attest , because some old guns  --  like the century-old Stevens Favorite we found on a gun shop 's back rack  --  are so rusted , pitted , and battered that they are little more than junk and have almost no collector 's value . The challenge was not to make a silk purse from a sow 's ear but to restore style and dignity to a piece that had suffered the scars of a hundred years of use and abuse . The first step for any bluing job is to completely disassemble and clean the parts ( photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwdrivers so you do n't add to the damage done by improper screwdrivers used in the past . Then swab rust and blue remover on the various parts in preparation for dressing the metal . You will be smart to wear rubber gloves . The first rule of dressing metal is to keep flat surfaces flat and corners sharp . Uneven surfaces and rounded corners are the sure marks of a careless amateur . In photo No. 2 , 320-grit aluminum oxide finishing paper is wrapped around a file to provide a flat support to keep surfaces true . The finishing motions are long , lengthwise strokes . Back-and-forth strokes across the barrel may cause low spots and rounded edges . Dress the metal only enough to remove old rust and shallow dings and to sharpen the edges of the original markings . With the barrel secured in a padded vice , dress and polish the rounded portion with finishing paper wrapped around a foam pad ( No. 3 ) , which will conform to the curvature of the barrel . For initial removal of heavier rust and battering , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For final dressing , however , the hand-polishing should be lengthwise along the barrel to avoid dips and wavy surfaces . Contoured areas , especially inside curves , are best finished with finishing paper wrapped around a wooden block with a matching curve or contour . The breech contour is nicely restored to its original shape and polished by a simple rotating motion with paper wrapped around a dowel . A quick and easy way to polish and restore screw heads is to chuck them in an electric drill and spin the screw head against fine-grit finishing paper wrapped around a block or file . Complete final polishing with #0000 superfine steel wool ( No. 4 ) . Or , a smart alternative to hand-polishing is an electric buffing wheel . By using polishing compounds in different textures , old finish or even rust can be quickly removed and the metal brought to a mirror finish . If not found at your local hardware store , these inexpensive compounds are available from Brownells . At the final polishing stage , all parts must be handled with a clean glove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil the blue . Fingerprints , dirt , and oil are common causes of spotty , second-rate rebluing jobs . Apply the bluing paste with a clean swab directly to the metal 's surface ( No. 5 ) . Spread the bluing chemical on liberally in an even coat . The metal begins turning blue immediately and your careful work is instantly rewarded . Using a small pad of clean superfine steel wool , lightly polish the surface of the metal ( No. 6 ) . Then rinse away the remaining bluing with tap water , but do not touch the metal yet except with the gloved hand . If the coloration is spotty or uneven or lacks depth , apply a an second coat of bluing chemical , followed by a light buffing in with steel wool . Usually two applications will give the metal a deep , midnight blue . When you are satisfied with the depth and evenness of the blue , it 's time to polish and neutralize the newly treated metal with an oily cotton pad or with a Sheath brand gun cloth ( No. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 8 with the battered relic we began with , it 's hard to believe they are one and the same rifle . The old Stevens Favorite has been given a face-lift that should last another century . The simple setup for a hot Belgian bluing job includes only the chemical , a hot plate , a pan for boiling water , steel wool , swabs , and clean gloves ( photo No. 1 ) . Using distilled water is a good idea . As with all rebluing processes , start by disassembling and cleaning the parts  --  for this demonstration we used a reshaped Winchester Model 70 trigger guard and floorplate . Finish by polishing with superfine steel wool ( No. 2 ) or with a motorized buffer . Next , heat the parts to be blued in boiling water until they are hot , about five minutes ( No. 3 ) . Remove the parts with a piece of wire . They will dry instantly . Be extremely careful about touching the parts at this point .

After the blue is swabbed on the hot metal , the parts are immediately returned to the hailing water for a few minutes ( No. 5 ) . After the initial application of the Belgian blue and follow-up bath in boiling water , the steel takes on a cloudy gray coloration . Using moistened steel wool ( No. 6 ) , lightly buff the parts . During this early stage the job does n't seem to hold much promise , hut after a second swabbing , boiling , and polishing , the blue turns much darker . Simply repeat the process until you get the desired evenness and depth of color . After repeating this process three times , the trigger guard in photo No. 7 has the rich , deep-black coloration so beloved by fanciers of fine guns . To complete the job , neutralize the metal surface with a preservative oil , applied with a soft cotton swab or Sheath gun wipe . The final result ( No. 8 ) does credit to this or any fine gun . Baked-on Lacquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts ( a Remington Model 700 trigger-guard assembly was used here ) . While removing the old finish is not necessary except to polish away scratches and dings , the metal must be perfectly clean . Trichloroethane , a super solvent and cleaner , is being used in photo No. 1 , below . To avoid runs and to assure an even coating , it is best to build up the finish with two or three thinly applied coats . We use a pasteboard-box " spray cabinet " with the gun parts suspended an wire ( No. 2 ) . Turning the wire from the top will position the parts for uniform coating . After the spray-on baking lacquer has dried , put the parts on an aluminum sheet ( No. 3 ) and pop them in the kitchen oven for 30 minutes at 350deg . The baked-on lacquer job looks factory-new and professional ( No. 4 ) . The matte finish is a perfect match for the dull-finish fiberglass stock . <p>                  @ @ @
