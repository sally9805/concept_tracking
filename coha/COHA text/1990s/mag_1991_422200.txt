Section : Articles Democracy can grow in Russia , but it must have local roots , and a people willing to tend it . <p> THERE IS no escaping the fact that our country has cruelly forfeited the entire twentieth century : all our much-trumpeted achievements have turned out to be illusory . From a flourishing condition we have been hurled back to a state of semi-barbarity , and we are sitting amid the wreckage . <p> We hold passionate discussions about the kind of government system that would suit us from now on , and the kind that would not , since this , we claim , is the key to everything . Yet recovery is today not a matter of simply identifying the most convenient system of government and then hastily churning out a marvelous constitution , paragraph by paragraph . We must demonstrate better foresight than did our luckless fathers and grandfathers in 1917 so that we might not repeat the chaos of that February by putting ourselves at the mercy of tempting slogans and breathless orators , or otherwise reproducing the self- chosen path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the new leaders now coming to the fore will immediately prove to be farsighted and sober-minded . <p> After a cannibalistic period lasting three-quarters of a century , after the exorbitant price we have already paid , and given the fact that in terms of the political spectrum we happen to have ended up on the side with a tradition of strong central authority , it behooves us not to make rash moves toward chaos . For as 1917 taught us , anarchy is the ultimate peril . <p> Unless one craves revolution , a state must possess the qualities of continuity and stability . Some elements of the current structure will have to serve for the time being for the simple reason that they already exist . <p> It goes without saying that we shall gradually reshape the entire state organism . This undertaking must begin at the margin somewhere ; it should not be tackled all at once . What is clear is that the process should start at the local level , with grassroots issues . While preserving a strong central authority , we must patiently and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we shall of course adopt some particular type of political structure , but in view of our total inexperience in such matters this may not be a felicitous choice at first , not something suited to the specific needs of our country . We must resolutely seek our own path here . We have lately been assuring ourselves that there is no need of any quest or reflection on our part , that it is simply a matter of adopting the way it is done in the West ' as quickly as possible . But in the West it is done in oh so many different ways , with every country following its own tradition . One might think that we are the only people who need neither look back nor pay heed to the wise things said in our country before we were born . <p> The strength or weakness of a society depends more on the level of its spiritual life than on its level of industrialization . Neither a market economy nor even general abundance constitutes the crowning achievement of human life . If a nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved from collapse by the most perfect government structure or by any industrial development : a tree with a rotten core can not stand . This is so because of all the possible freedoms the one that will inevitably come to the fore will be the freedom to be unscrupulous ; that is the freedom that can be neither prevented nor anticipated by any law . It is an unfortunate fact that a pure social atmosphere can not be legislated into being . <p> And that is why the destruction of our souls over three-quarters of a century is the most terrifying thing of all . It is terrible to see that the corrupt ruling class  --  the multimillion-strong appointed bureaucracy ( nomenklatura ) which serves Party and state  --  was incapable of voluntarily giving up any of the privileges it had appropriated to itself . For decades this class has lived at the expense of the people , and it would have liked to continue doing so . <p> And what about those glorious forces of glasnost and perestroika ? Among these fashionable words we look in vain for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward glasnost of all those tainted voices which had given decades of loyal service to totalitarianism . Of every four troubadours of glasnost , three were former toadies of Brezhnevism , and who among them uttered a word of personal repentance instead of cursing the faceless period of stagnation ' ' ? And the same individuals who for decades have befuddled the minds of university students continue to hold forth self-confidently from the rostrums of our humanities departments . Tens of thousands of smatterers in our country are tarnished by their hypocrisy and weather-vane mentality ; must we really drag along these festering moral sores into our future ? <p> West Germany was suffused with the feeling of repentance before the arrival of its economic boom . But in our country no one has even begun to repent . And all that glasnost is bedecked , festooned with the same old plump and heavy clusters of lies . Only we seem not to notice . That is a recipe for warped development . Time to Think <p> IT WO N'T DO to hope that our current time of troubles ' will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to sit down and think over ' our plans for the future . History is a continuum , and no one will grant us the favor of any breathing spell , just as the Russian Constituent Assembly , in February 1917 , was never given the chance to sit down and think things over . ' So that no matter how painfully the burning issues of today weigh down upon us , it behooves us to give advance thought to the shape of our future arrangement . <p> Before the 1917 Revolution the bulk of our people had no experience with political concepts , and the ideas that were pounded into our heads by propaganda in the subsequent seventy years served only to cloud our minds . But now that our country has begun moving in the direction of real political life , and when the forms of the government-to-be are already being discussed , it is useful to focus on the precise meaning of some terms in order to prevent possible mistakes . <p> Plato , and Aristotle after him , identified three types of states . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one ; aristocracy , or the rule of the best or for the best purpose ; and polity , or the rule of the people in a small city-state for the common good ( we now term this democracy ) . It would appear that since that time no one has created any structure that could not be subsumed under these categories ; the only additions were various types of constitutions . So we can not be said to have much of a choice : the whole flow of modern history will unquestionably predispose us to choose democracy . <p> But in opting for democracy we must understand clearly just what we are choosing , what price we shall have to pay , and that we are choosing it as a means , not as an end in itself . The contemporary philosopher Karl Popper has said that one chooses democracy not because it abounds in virtues , but only in order to avoid tyranny . We choose it in full awareness of its faults and with the intention of seeking ways to overcome them . <p> Many new countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy , yet despite such evidence this same period has seen an elevation of democracy from a particular state structure into a sort of universal principle of human existence , almost a cult . <p> Following the bitter experience of 1917 , when we plunged headlong into what we had thought was democracy , Vasily Maklakov , a prominent leader of the Constitutional Democrats , reminded us all of a simple truth by the following admission : In order to function , democracy needs a certain level of political discipline among the populace . ' But this is precisely what we lacked in 1917 , and one fears that there is even less of it today . <p> The aim of universal suffrage is to permit the Popular Will to be manifested : that genuine Will which is supposed to guide everything in a direction most advantageous to the people . Yet no one has been able to say whether such a single Will exists at all or to define its qualities . And it is remarkable that different systems of counting votes will produce different or even diametrically opposed readings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election campaigns involving large numbers of voters and conducted among an electorate with no direct knowledge of the candidates can be so frivolous and shrill that , given the frequent bias of the media , a large proportion of the voters may turn away in disgust . And television , though it can bring out a candidate 's appearance as well as his public demeanor , does nothing to reveal his abilities as a statesman . Campaigns of this sort invariably entail the degradation of political thought . The very system does not inspire political figures to rise above their political interests ; quite the reverse : a campaign based on moral principles can become a recipe for defeat . <p> In any case it is not feasible for the people to give their representatives precise instructions concerning all future contingencies . Nor does there exist a stimulus that will impel those deputies holding office to rise above their future electoral interests and above party machinations so as to serve only the clearly perceived interests of the country . As a result , the actions that are taken are those having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view might suggest that these actions will bring them harm . And in a country as large as ours , the possibility of keeping tabs on elected representatives is correspondingly reduced , while the chance of abuses on their part increases . <p> These critical comments about contemporary democracy are not meant to suggest that the future Russian Union will have no need for democracy . It will need it very much . But given our people 's total lack of preparation for the intricacies of democratic life , democracy must be built from the bottom up , gradually , patiently , and in a way designed to last rather than being proclaimed thunderously from above in its full-fledged form . <p> All the failings noted earlier would rarely apply to democracies of small areas  --  mid-sized towns , small settlements ( poselki ) , groups of villages ( volosti , stanitsy ) , or areas up to the size of a county ( uyezd , rayon ) . Only in areas of this size can voters have confidence in their choice of candidates , since they will be familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in terms of their moral qualities . At this level phony reputations do not hold up , nor would a candidate be helped by empty rhetoric or party sponsorship . <p> These are precisely the dimensions within which the new Russian democracy can begin to grow , gain strength , and acquire self-awareness . It also represents a level that is most certain to take root because it will involve the vital concerns of each locality : ensuring unpolluted water and air , overseeing housing , hospitals , nurseries , schools , shops , and the local distribution of goods , while also giving vigorous support to the growth of untrammeled local economic initiatives . <p> Without properly constituted local self-government there can be no stable or prosperous life , and the very concept of civic freedom loses all meaning . <p> By ALEKSANDR SOLZHENITSYN <p> <p> This article was adapted from Mr. Solzhenitsyn 's Rebuilding Russia : Reflections and Tentative Proposals , translated by Alexis Klimoff , to be published in Nov . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
