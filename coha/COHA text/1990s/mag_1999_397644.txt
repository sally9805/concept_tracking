Section : Culture Zone Viewpoint In cybercrime , they 're printouts  --  and not to be trusted <p> The letter from Carl Payne came in the spring of 1998 . It was handwritten  --  no letterhead . I was suspicious . Being a columnist for The Boston Globe and the author of seven books , I get my share of communications from cranks , crazies and convicts . But Payne , I soon realized , was none of the above . <p> Payne wrote that he was the defendant in a criminal computer-hacking case . Back in December 1994 , at the age of 28 , he had helped start an Internet service provider in Utah that was eventually named Fibernet . But in the autumn of 1996 the board voted to oust Payne after he locked horns with the man who was poised to become Fibernet 's new president . <p> A week after Payne left Fibernet , someone had hacked into the company 's computers and ransacked their systems . Fibernet had immediately fingered Payne and persuaded the Utah County Attorney 's office to charge him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Computer Crimes , " a second-degree felony . The prosecution had a pile of evidence , the case was going to trial , and he needed my help . <p> At first glance , Payne did indeed look like the likely culprit . Studies have shown that most computer crimes are perpetrated by disgruntled employees . Most computer-hacking cases that reach a courtroom pivot on some aspect of the law , such as whether the hack was illegal  --  and not on whether the suspect actually did it . I had never heard of a case in which the accused " hacker " maintained his innocence , especially in the light of hard evidence . Yet that 's just what Payne was doing . Intrigued , I called him . <p> On the telephone Payne was talkative , friendly  --  and very worried . We agreed that he would send me all the evidence the County Attorney 's office had provided to his lawyer . I would assess its quality and write a report . If the case went to trial , and he still wanted me , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first stint as a paid expert witness . <p> A week passed and a thick packet arrived in my mailbox . It contained Payne 's account of the incident , the police report , depositions from all involved , and nearly 200 pages of computer printouts . After four hours spent poring over the documents , I emerged into the living room and told my wife : " Things do n't look good for Mr. Payne . " <p> Payne 's last day of work was October 30 , 1996 . On November 6 , someone had logged into each of Fibernet 's main computers and started deleting files . Customer Web pages and e-mail were erased . Accounting information was wiped out . Then the attacker gained access to each of the company 's special-purpose communications computers , called routers , and deleted their programming . Ultimately , the company lost more than half its customers , laid off many employees , left its managers without salary , and nearly folded . <p> Payne , who had been Fibernet 's chief technical officer , certainly had the knowledge necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he might have had a motive : revenge . Some other details also seemed to point in Payne 's direction : Among the several accounts utilized in the hack was one called " carl , " which presumably belonged to him , an account called " dbowling , " which belonged to one of his friends , and one called " usenet . " Sometime prior to the attack , somebody had modified the " usenet " account and given it full system privileges , creating  --  to use the lingo of computer security  --  a " back door . " <p> But perhaps the most damning document in the package was the report of the police officer who had gone to Payne 's house following the attack , When the officer arrived , he found that Payne had reformatted his home computer 's hard drive and was reinstalling the operating system . In the trash can next to the computer was a pile of floppy disks . The officer neither impounded Payne 's computer nor seized the floppies  --  he later testified in court that he had assumed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked suspicious . But another call to Payne produced a different perspective . The last week he was at Fibernet , Payne told me , he had turned over all the company 's administrative passwords to the new president . The next day , Payne discovered that his password had been changed . On the morning of the attack , Payne said , he had tried dialing Fibernet on his modern several times , on the remote chance that his account had been somehow re-enabled , but he had never successfully logged in . In fact , he was reformatting his home computer because it crashed every time Fibernet rejected his password . All those disks in the trash , he said , were old files he was getting rid of in preparation for a move to California . <p> I was n't sure whom I should believe , but I was starting to like Carl Payne . He could have been me 10 years ago  --  a technically savvy geek who had gotten himself in trouble with a bunch of suits who were more comfortable with spreadsheets than C compilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a closer inspection of the computer printouts that made up the heart of the prosecution 's case convinced me that , no matter who the culprit was , there was n't enough evidence to convict anybody . <p> For one thing , none of the printouts allowed me to pinpoint a phone number or computer from which the attack had been launched , let alone the identity of the perpetrator . And something else called the evidence into even greater question : It appeared somebody had tampered with some of the files before printing them out . The log had small typographical errors-a few extra spaces inserted on one line , a letter dropped on another  --  as if somebody had taken the original log files into a word processor and cut and pasted text before printing . This meant that the information on those pages was suspect . And why did all of this evidence come to me in printed form ? Where were the original electronic records ? Guilty or not , I thought , no one should be convicted on the basis of tampered evidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to follow the case . In December , I boarded a plane for Utah . When l arrived at the Utah County Courthouse in Provo , the opening arguments had just concluded . The prosecution 's theory was simple : Carl Payne was a technically brilliant but hard-to-handle employee . When Fibernet gave him notice that he was going to be terminated , Payne installed a back door that would allow him to wipe out the company 's computers after he left . <p> It turned out that in ousting Payne , Fibernet had fired the only employee capable of repairing the damage from the attack . So in addition to calling the police after the incident , they had called a computer consultant to come in and try to get the system back up and running . The consultant , Stacey Son , became the lead expert witness for the prosecution . <p> Son 's testimony explained why there were only 200 pages of printouts in evidence  --  Fibernet had hired him to get the system working quickly , not to document the damage for an investigation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files . Neither had the police , it turned out : The officer who visited Fibernet and then searched Payne 's house testified that he had no experience with the UNIX operating system that Fibernet and Payne used . Instead of impounding computers and disks , the officer had simply accepted the paper printouts Fibernet had handed over . <p> On the stand , Son admitted that there was no way for him to tell the identity of the perpetrator . But the biggest hole in the prosecution 's theory became apparent when the defense questioned Son about the attack itself . It was poorly done , Son explained : Not enough information was wiped out . It seemed to me to be the work of an amateur with only rudimentary knowledge of UNIX systems , not that of somebody of Payne 's admitted prowess . <p> The prosecution rested on Thursday , the third day of the trial . That night in my hotel room , I looked again over those critical printouts . The prosecution 's most important exhibits were pages 151 and 152 , which showed each account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ password , and a third number for accounting purposes . The useridentification number had been the subject of much testimony , since its manipulation was a critical step in creating the back door . Nobody had discussed the significance of the accounting number . <p> Friday morning I woke up in my hotel room at 5 a.m . I had a hunch about the elusive last number . I needed to check the documentation for the version of UNIX that Fibernet had been using . I did n't have the manual with me , but I booted up my laptop and found it on the Internet ; it explained that the number was used to warn people when it was time to change their passwords  --  it indicated the number of days between January 1 , 1970 , and the last time the password was changed . <p> I felt stupid . Here was possibly the most important piece of evidence in the entire trial , and I had not even realized it until the morning I was supposed to testify ! Encoded in the record of each account 's password @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by decoding the number , I could establish precisely when the " back door " was created . In the hours before the trial , I wrote a small program to translate the numbers . <p> What my homemade program showed me clinched the case . The back door had been installed on October 31st , the day after Payne 's last day of work  --  and after his access to the Fibernet system had already been cut off . Payne could n't have created it . What 's more , another account 's password change dated to more than two weeks after the attack , a detail that would be impossible if the printout was really the same one Son had made that day . This showed irrefutably that the chain of evidence had been broken . <p> At 10 a.m . I took the stand . I described my credentials , the proper handling of security incidents , the paucity of evidence , and the telltale indications that the printouts had been altered . Finally , I testified about what I had learned that morning . From that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the attorneys gave closing arguments , and the jury began deliberations around dinnertime . In the late evening , they came back with the only verdict I thought they could reasonably reach : not guilty on all counts . <p> Today , Carl Payne oversees a large computer network in California . Fibernet , meanwhile , is thriving . In the course of the trial I came to believe in Payne 's innocence , but never felt that I had learned the real story . In closing arguments , the defense suggested a few possibilities : Somebody at Fibernet could have carried out the attack . All employee whom Payne fired in July of 1996 might have done it . Or perhaps the crime was committed by some unknown hacker on the Internet , an unfortunate coincidence with Payne 's dismissal . <p> Fibernet , for its part , declined to comment for this article . <p> There 's really no way to know what happened , because the Utah police did not do a meaningful investigation . They simply asked the victim , " Who did it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company then provided all of the evidence used in the prosecution . The police never would have followed such haphazard procedures in the wake of a physical breakin  --  they would have done their own detective work , carefully collecting and preserving the evidence . As more and more crimes occur in the neighborhood we call " cyberspace " police need better tools and training . Without it , we risk bungled investigations and the very real possibility that innocent people will be found guilty for the hacks of others . <p> By Simson L. Garfinkel <p>
