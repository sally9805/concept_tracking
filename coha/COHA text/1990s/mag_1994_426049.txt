Section : nutrition Eggnog , cookies , fruitcake . . . this could be another wide holiday season for your waistline . How to indulge without showing a bulge <p> It begins innocently enough . First your secretary brings you a tray of frosted cookies shaped vaguely like reindeer . Then your mother sends you a fruitcake so big it gives the UPS man a back sprain . Finally your boss decides to reward your department by throwing a holiday bash at Gaston 's House of Goulash , where even a mere gaze at the buffet puts on 3 pounds . <p> Remember that willpower you were once so proud of ? It 's been discarded faster than a wedding ring at a bachelor party . <p> Gluttony , it seems , is as central to the holiday season as credit-card bills and burned-out Christmas lights . In those festive five weeks nestled in between Thanksgiving and New Year 's Day , an average man can put away more than 120,000 calories , according to Cheryl Hartsough , R.D. , sports nutritionist and coauthor of The Recipe Collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional 460 to 900 calories a day , every day , and the result can be a weight gain of 5 or even 10 pounds . <p> Now , what you do n't need is one more source of nagging about your weight . Fine with us  --  we hate to lecture . Besides , there 's no reason you ca n't enjoy yourself around the holidays and still keep your waistline in check . We 've created a sort of consumer 's guide to gluttony , a simple , realistic bar-to-buffet-to-banquet approach that will let you savor the real pleasures of the season without beginning the new year saddled with the guilt or the extra pounds . And , if you do n't abandon your exercise during the holiday season , you can partake even more . ( See " The Secrets of Excess , " page 112 . ) <p> So , as our special holiday treat ( because we 're too cheap to buy all of you presents ) , we offer you a road map to help you successfully navigate the holidays and their accompanying epicurean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the best place to let liquor go to your head , but let 's face it : Once Brirnley from finance starts bending your ear , it 's hard not to start bending your elbow . <p> That can be a problem , waistwise . While alcohol is nonfat , it 's a darn good impersonator , says Jorge Calles , M.D. , an endocrinologist and obesity expert at the University of Vermont . Given the choice , your body will burn the booze and sock any fat you eat with it into storage . What that means is that you might as well shove those extra handfuls of cocktail peanuts into your back pocket , because that 's where they 're going to end up anyway . But by going a little easier on the alcohol , you 're less likely to interfere with your body 's fat-burning mechanism . <p> We 're not going to tell you not to drink . But we are going to tell you to drink smart . " Beer in general is better than hard alcohol because it 's higher in carbohydrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calories in a beer simply from the process of digesting it , " says Hartsough . The one beer to have if you 're having more than one should have the word " light " somewhere on its label . It 'll typically run about 100 calories . <p> If your arm is being twisted to indulge in some other holiday libation , consider the following : <p> Bloody Mary . This usually runs about 115 calories , with less than a gram of fat . Your personal limit : one joke about how you 're drinking it because the tomato juice makes it so healthful . <p> Champagne . Only 84 calories per flute . Toast away . <p> Rum toddy . At only 114 calories a glass , not a bad choice . And the hot water , ground nutmeg , sugar and slice of lemon will fill you up nicely . " Warm liquids sit in the stomach longer , so you 'll pig out less , " says Hartsough . <p> White wine spritzer. 70 calories . What drinks should you avoid ? <p> Eggnog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggnog anyway . Take a pass . One smallish frothy glass runs about 171 calories with 10 grams of fat , which makes it a lot like a quarter-pounder in a cup . Same for any cream-based drink , such as a White Russian . <p> Daiquiri . Weighs in at 224 calories . Overweight , depressed writer Ernest Hemingway was partial to these . <p> Dessert wines . At 157 calories per glass , this sweet stuff does n't just go to your head . If you love it , have a glass . But , we have to ask , why do you love it ? The Buffet Table <p> Nothing like an all-you-can-eat buffet table to bring out the urge to overindulge  --  especially when the food is on someone else 's nickel . Let your willpower ebb and you may find yourself hurdling over your boss 's wife for that last cocktail weenie or feverishly pushing a frailer executive aside just to thrust a pithy chip into the sour-cream dip . <p> Not that you should n't take advantage of a good thing , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush . Here are a few tried-and-true rules that 'll keep you in control as well as fully safed . <p> First of all , slow down . The food 's been caught , gutted , skinned , blanched , boiled , steamed , grilled and cooked  --  it ai n't going anywhere . So ease in slow . Treat it like sex : Focus on the things you really like , take your time to savor them , and then , of course , leave . <p> Second , never use a plate unless you have to , Men like to build things . But now that real estate and construction prices are too high to actually build buildings , we 're reduced to turning our architectural frustrations onto the Chinet , piling it high with strategically balanced pieces of chow . And , as the saying goes , You built it , you eat it . Solution : dainty cocktail napkins . Carry your appetizers and finger foods one small portion at a time , and that 's how you 'll eat . Note : This tactic wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that you 've got the napkin , let 's take a tour around the buffet . First stop , the meat department . <p> Sliced chicken breast . A great first entry into the sandwich sweepstakes . A 3-ounce portion has 141 calories and 3 grams of fat . <p> Sliced pork . Not quite " the other white meat , " at 177 calories and 8 grams of fat for a small portion , <p> Perfectly symmetrical sliced meats of unknown origin rolled up and skewered by little toothpicks with decorative tinsel . Whoa ! One general rule : If you ca n't identify the actual animal involved , skip it . Al-most any marbled , sliced , meatlike thing that 's perfectly square or round will carry 80 to 100 calories with 8 to 9 grams of fat per ounce  --  one large or two small slices . <p> Pate . Duck the goose and go for the chicken liver . It is n't low-fat by any means  --  58 percent of the calories are from fat . But compare it to the goose pate with 85 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half bad . <p> Potato salad . Mayonnaise is the problem here . At 179 calories with 10 fat grams per half cup , eating potato salad is somewhat akin to reverse liposuction . <p> Cole slaw . Straight from the **25;199;TOOLONG department . A half cup of slaw is only 41 calories and 2 fat grams . <p> Shrimp . Indulge yourself . A large steamed shrimp contains only 5 calories  --  with just a trace of fat . At 45 calories per tablespoon ( no fat ) , you can have some cocktail sauce , too , <p> Lasagna . Have some , but you 're better off with a brownie-size piece instead of the usual whole-spatula portion . This innocent-looking dish can pack more than 310 calories , with 41 percent of the calories from fat . <p> The cheese log . No party is complete wireout this hulking loaf of processed spackle covered with almond slivers . Handle with care  --  one cheesy ounce has roughly 110 calories , almost 75 percent coming from fat . An ounce , by the way , is about the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spread the stuff thin , have one or two , then move on . <p> Dip . Cream cheese-based dips deliver a big 100 calories with 10 grams of fat per ounce  --  about a tablespoon 's worth  --  but we ca n't expect you to pass them up entirely . Just make one smart substitution : Instead of using a potato chip , dip with raw vegetables , if there are any , to save 6 calories and almost a gram of fat per chip . Multiply that by 10 or 20 chips ( because no one really eats just one ) , and the savings are substantial . <p> Guacamole . A single tablespoon has 2 grams of fat . <p> Bowl o ' nuts . They 're unavoidable at parties , so do n't bother trying . Just be choosy . Pick around the macadamias ( 200 calories and a sizable 21 grams of fat per ounce ) and the pecans ( 188 calories and 18 grams of fat ) . Go for the peanuts ( which no one else wants anyway ) , pistachios , cashews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per ounce . However , they still get more than 70 percent of their calories from fat , so have a handful and move on . <p> Bridge mixes . Those milk chocolate-covered almonds and peanuts average about 160 calories an ounce with 12 grams of fat . To nibble , not to nosh . <p> Brownies . One homemade brownie with nuts will run you more than 300 calories and 21 grams of fat . Better you should pass it up for . . . <p> Fudge . Remarkable , yes , but at one ounce , fudge carries only 112 calories with 3 grams of fat . Holiday Dinners <p> The holiday dinner usually goes like this : You sit down , mumble your prayers , then lay waste to the spread the way Godzilla dismantled downtown Osaka . And when you 're through , all that 's left is a carcass , a smidgen of self-respect and an overpowering urge to take a nap . Within this frenzy , however , is a chance for moderation . You can pile some of the foods on your plate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . smaller amounts . . . or politely passed on to an unsuspecting relative . <p> The bird . Lose the skin . Without it , white meat is only 117 calories per small sewing , with 18 percent of that fat . Dark meat is a touch fattier , but as long as you skip the skin , you 'll do fine . <p> Ancillary main courses . Walton-size families might have an assortment of meats on the table . If other traditional foods like ham or goose are present , pick the pork . A 4-ounce slice of store-bought glazed ham will run about 243 calories and 5 grams of fat . Not exactly lean cuisine , but compared to 4 ounces of goose with 346 calories with 25 grams of fat , it 's downright light . <p> Stuffing . Smart chefs will use chicken broth instead of butter , but at Mom 's table , smart does n't always cut it . If she 's imaginative , she may toss in everything from pecans to sausage , until you 've got an exceedingly rich mix . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grams of fat  --  and no one eats just 1 ounce . One cup  --  the average serving size  --  will hit you with more than 500 calories and 31 grams of fat . <p> Cranberry sauce . Load up . A half cup has 209 calories and less than a gram of fat . <p> Risotto . This popular rice side dish is pretty hefty , with 214 calories and 7 grams of fat per half cup , So is wild rice with peanuts . The wild rice itself is quite lean , at 100 calories and only a trace of fat . Casually push aside some of the nuts , which add 82 calories and 7 grams of fat , and you 're looking at under 150 calories total . <p> Asparagus in hollandaise sauce . Do n't stiff yourself on the spears  --  eight of them are only 30 calories . But the hollandaise sauce can rack up serious fat  --  2 tablespoons add 88 calories , with almost 90 percent of the calories coming from fat . By scraping most of it off and leaving just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 or so calories of fat baggage . <p> Broccoli with cheddar cheese sauce . A serving of broccoli is 32 calories , and 2 tablespoons of cheese sauce adds only 31 calories and 2 grams of fat . <p> Green beans with almonds . Without the nuts , a half cup is about 25 calories with less than a gram of fat . With them , it 's 70 calories and 4 grams of fat . Push a few silvers to the corner of your plate and do n't worry about the rest . <p> Candied yams . We fail to see the allure of this dish , but if you 're perverse enough to like them  --  feel free . Only 110 calories a serving , candied yams pack no fat . Yams in heavy syrup are better and still have only 139 calories and one gram of fat . <p> Mashed potatoes with gravy . If the high point of your holiday meal is creating a crater-sized lake in your potatoes and filling it with thick brown gravy , consider at least downsizing it to a pond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 calories with just a trace of fat , the gravy seriously ups the ante . <p> Scalloped potatoes . For a half cup serving , we 're only talking 103 calories . But it 's charged up with 4 grams of fat . Have a helping  --  but pass on seconds and instead intercept the mashed potatoes before they head to the end of the table . <p> Biscuits . Even without butter , they average about 100 calories and 5 grams of fat each . If it 's on the table , opt instead for sourdough bread at 70 calories and 1 gram of fat per slice . <p> Garlic bread . Watch out . No threat from the garlic , but the butter piles on 10 grams of fat . The Dessert Tray <p> Ideally , the host may offer a delectable slice of angel-food cake with strawberries  --  a light treat at 153 calories with just a smidgen of fat . But in all likelihood , your dessert will be a bruiser  --  a rich pie of some sort topped with ice cream or some heavy sauces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you might want to minimize the damage by knocking off the extra toppings : the value-added chocolate kiss , pistachios , walnuts and coconut flakes often placed as garnish on top of the cakes or brownies . Some of the worst offenders : <p> Hard sauce . A case . in point : Mincemeat pie is a bit on the fattening side at 365 calories and 16 grams of fat , but when you add just 2 tablespoons of hard sauce , consisting of confectioners ' sugar , butter , cream and brandy  --  you 'll be consuming a grand total of 531 calories and 26 grams of fat . Scrape off some of the sauce and you might save yourself 50 to 70 calories and some extra fat . <p> Hot fudge . Just leave it off your already hefty scoop of ice cream and you 'll knock off an extra 100 calories and 1 to 4 grams of fat . Better yet , use some chocolate syrup , which has less than 1 gram of fat . <p> Whipped cream . Surprisingly , this is n't the offender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie , the dessert officially approved by dead Pilgrims . At 241 calories and 13 grams of fat per slice , it 's not exactly a lightweight , but if you 're going to have it , you might as well have the whipped cream , too . You 're only adding 19 calories and 2 grams of fat . <p> Finally , you now have another good reason to avoid the ubiquitous fruitcake  --  unless , for some twisted reason , you really like it . Not only does it taste awful and stick to your teeth , one serving contains between 200 and 400 calories . Our advice  --  stuff a slice in your briefcase and use it as a paperweight later . <p> By Greg Gutfeld <p> THE SECRETS OF EXCESS Here 's how to eat practically anything you want , without paying the price <p> This is what we call good news : New research suggests that , just as you can train your body to run a long-distance race , you can train it to survive the holidays  --  to come through a marathon of gluttony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the indulgence , none of the consequences . <p> The secret is exercise . You knew that already ? Well , here 's something you did n't know : The well-conditioned body automatically adjusts its fat-burning potential upward to compensate for a period of . . . let 's just call it self-indulgence . In a recent study of test subjects given the not-too-challenging task of overeating 1,000 calories a day , those who exercised aerobically not only burned off the extra calories but also burned more of them from fat . As for the ones who overate but did n't exercise , their metabolisms became more sluggish than before . They actually burned off fewer fat calories than they did when they were on their normal diets . " Exercise may improve your muscles ' intrinsic capacity to pick up the fat from the blood rather than the carbohydrate , " explains Dr. Calles . <p> If you add strength training to the mix , your fat-exemption gets even better . One study , for example , found that test subjects who began a weight-training program had to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight , all while losing body fat and gaining muscle strength . " Strength training lets you eat more by upping your basal metabolic rate  --  the energy burned constantly to maintain body function , " says study author Wayne Campbell , Ph.D . <p>
