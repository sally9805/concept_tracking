She was dozing on a faded Navajo blanket with the filmy shade of a maple tree drawn like a veil across her skin . Her blouse was still opened to where he 'd unbuttoned it down to the sky blue of the bra she 'd brought back as a souvenir from Italy . <p> Martin was lying just beyond the edge of the shadows thrown by her eyelashes . He had removed his shirt and spread it beneath him on the grass . It was hot , and lounging in her company seemed to intensify the light . Even the birds were drowsy . Only a single ant was working . It had him by the toe . <p> " Trying to tow me away ; ' he would have called out to her but for the lassitude , and her aversion to puns . The Woman Who Hates Puns , she sometimes called herself . <p> With his eyes closed and the sun warm on his lids , it seemed as if he and the ant were the only creatures on the planet still awake . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after a while he began to sense a nearly imperceptible movement across the grass . He squinted up into the high blue sky , not caring really where he was headed . It was a day for such an attitude , but then most any day spent with her could trigger a mood like that-could require it , in fact . Since he 'd met her , Martin had increasingly spent his days in a trance for which he had no name . To describe this addicting state of mind , he joked that he was living in Limbo . <p> This was Limbo : high , heavenly-looking clouds that threw no shadow and assumed no shapes . No wind , yet a faint hiss in the trees . Sunlight faintly weighted with perfume . In Limbo , where dream ruled , siestas were mandatory . The grass slid gently beneath him without leaving a stain along his spine . Grass blades combed his hair as he went by until his hair assumed the slant of grass . <p> So long as it was only a single ant , Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his body in black columns , swarming , entering his mouth , ears , nostrils , and eyes in a pulsing stream , as if he were just another corpse to clean . <p> It was a morbid vision , not in keeping with such a lovely day . <p> Even here in Limbo , Martin thought , one apparently never recovers from having had " Lonigan and the Ants " read to him as a child . <p> He could still remember his anticipation  --  a mix of excitement and terror  --  on those Sunday afternoons in summer when his uncle Wayne would arrive with a storybook under his arm . Uncle Wayne would come to baby-sit for little Martin while Martin 's parents went out to the backyard barbecues from which they would return " pickled " as his father called it  --  though they looked more as if they 'd been boiled  --  smelling of Manhattans , and laughing too easily and loudly . <p> " Remember , ' his mother would caution conspiratorially before she left , " do n't ask Uncle Wayne about the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't worry if he does n't talk much at all . " <p> As young as Martin was , it was clear to him that the baby-sitting was as much for Uncle Wayne 's sake as it was for the sake of Martin 's parents or himself . <p> Uncle Wayne usually did n't talk much when his parents were there . He seemed shy , embarrassed , almost ashamed . His face was pitted from acne , which gave him the look of a teenager . Sometimes , Martin imagined that Uncle Wayne 's face had been pitted by shrapnel . <p> " Do you like stories ? " his uncle had asked him during their first visit . <p> " Sure , ' Martin said . <p> " Good . Stories are what kept me sane " Uncle Wayne said , then laughed in the odd , stifled way of his as if at a private joke between them . <p> But reading aloud , his uncle lost his shyness . Uncle Wayne did n't simply read stories , he brought them to life . During " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to room while his uncle , reading aloud the entire time , stalked him , the storybook in one hand , and in the other a bow made from a clothes hanger strung with a rubber band and armed with an arrow fashioned from a cardboard pant guard . <p> When they read " The Monkey 's Paw " Martin hid behind his bedroom door while his uncle mounted the stairs with the heavy-footed , ominous tread of someone dead who 'd been summoned back from the grave . Nearly quaking with fear , Martin had tried to wish him back into his grave while his uncle Wayne pounded on the door . <p> His uncle would open the book by Edgar Allan Poe and turn to his favorite story , " The Tell-Tale Heart " and the boy would force himself to watch his uncle 's face so as not to miss the instantaneous transformation when his uncle 's eyes assumed a maniacal gleam and his mouth twisted into a malevolent smile as he read the opening words  --  " I 'm not really mad "  --  then burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the stories they read together , it was " Lonigan and the Ants " that was the most frightening and memorable . How many Sunday afternoons , while other boys watched double-headers or shot baskets at a hoop suspended above a carport , had Martin sat sweating and listening intently as Uncle Wayne read about Lonigan making his way through the jungle , evading the hordes of army ants ? <p> The ants streamed past barriers of water and fire , relentlessly consuming everything in their path with their black grinding mandibles , mandibles that could strip a man down to his bones as neatly and savagely as a school of piranhas . <p> Martin ran from the ants through the house , pursued by his uncle , who was draped in a blanket that served as the amorphous shape of massing ants . Martin would race around the table with the ants gaining on him , knocking over chairs as they went . He 'd gallop up the stairs with the ants at his heels , slam himself into his room , but the weight of the ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed with nowhere else to run or hide as the ants oozed over his feet and began to engulf him while flushed and wild he 'd beat at them with a pillow , tussling , wrestling , and finally , overpowered , nearly smothered by them , he 'd have to scream , " Lonigan does n't die ! The ants do n't get him ! The ants do n't win ! " <p> Only then , reminded of the authority of the story , would his uncle sink back , his acne feverish , hands shaking , and silently they 'd both return downstairs , which is where Martin 's parents would find them , eating popsicles and watching the ballgame , when they 'd return home . <p> Remembering his uncle , Martin had forgotten the ant . There was an obvious bad pun there at which The Woman Who Hates Puns would have groaned . But even had Martin said it aloud , she might not have heard him , for the ant had managed to work its way beneath Martin 's back and , seizing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ground the merest fraction of a millimeter , balancing Martin so perfectly that neither his head nor heels dragged . And having succeeded in carrying Martin across the boundary of Limbo , back into the ordinary world , the ant now proceeded at a considerably more determined pace . <p> They went along like that , hurrying away from his slumbering Love , like a grain of rice from a wedding . <p> <p> By STUART DYBEK <p>
