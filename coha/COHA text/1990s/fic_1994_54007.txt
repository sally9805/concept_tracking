WHEN THE CLOYING ODOR of scorched marshmallow and hot yam filled the greenhouse , Bill Mauer cursed softly . Another damned premature . He got up from his watchman 's cot . The light of the full moon gleamed on the glass walls , throwing ghostly shadows over a jungle of yam vines as high as his head . He could see nothing , but the smell of hot candied yam grew stronger by the second . <p> Sighing , Bill picked up his auto-rooter . Nothing to do but find the premature and dig it out before the yam burst and let the bad strain of nanocritters contaminate the whole patch . <p> Bioengineered self-cooking yams had made his fortune . Self-cookers let even the busiest houseperson serve his/her family with nutritious meals with all of the rich goodness of genuine home cooking . But somehow the new , improved yams with the automatic self-candying option just were n't working out . He should have known better than to buy his yam nanotechnology from a firm calling itself " WerTech Transformations . " <p> As Bill walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants rustled in the wind , their dry leaves scratching against the glass walls . Now a yam runner caught around Bill 's ankle , and he bent over to unwrap it . <p> Wait a minute . There was no wind inside the greenhouse . Spooked , Bill ripped the yam loose , but a dozen others gripped his other ankle . He kicked viciously , but more and more vines clutched at his arms and legs . He tried to scream , but a burning hot candied yam thrust through his lips , cramming itself into his mouth and choking off the air . <p> A sharp yam stem plunged into his jugular , and a hot wave of pain struck as tiny nanocritters surged through his arteries , multiplying in their millions , transforming every protein , every molecule of his body . His arms and legs withered away , and his torso grew large , globular , yam shaped . <p> And now Bill , for the first time in his life , understood yams . He understood the softness of the mothering soil . He understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wings , upon yam leaves . But most of all , he understood yam pain , the brutal heat of an oven , the steel of a knife slashing through the skin . <p> Now he understood forks . <p> He understood cruel white teeth tearing at the tender yellow flesh , and all the degrading vocabulary of man 's inhumanity to yams . Rage flowed through his body , white , screaming anger . He felt a thirst for vengeance which must be satisfied , and could only be satisfied with blood , enough blood to drown centuries of oppression , millennia of baked yams , boiled yams , yams on the side , yams with butter , yams with sour cream , and worse , yes , worse than all of those  --  candied yams . <p> Now the light of the full moon gleamed on the glass walls of the greenhouse . Bill 's transformation was complete . Like a huge round moon he rolled to the greenhouse door , and a great rough beast , its hour come round at last , slouches toward the grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kent Patterson works as Regional Editor for Oregon Business Magazine .

" As far as I know , " Kent writes , " this is the first yam to star in a story for a major magazine . I hope it provides a role model for talented young yams everywhere . " <p>
