Section : U.S. News How the military encourages and promotes blacks without lowering its standards <p> When I joined the Air Force in 1980 , my eyes were not on the wild blue yonder . All I wanted was a steady job and an escape route out of the inner city . In north St. Louis , black kids like me  --  the daughter of former Southern sharecroppers  --  were n't raised to think big . I was a timid , aimless , underachieving 20-year-old who tried hard not to make eye contact . <p> When I was discharged 12 years later , I was a captain in intelligence too confident and too ambitious to be contained by the organization that had made me that way . I had served two tours of duty overseas , earned a college degree and a master 's and was on my way to Harvard Law School . <p> My experience in the military gives me some insight into the national debate about affirmative action . As the choice is often framed , America picks between two losing propositions : lowering standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretending that most blacks have had the same opportunities as most whites , keeping the status quo . I propose Plan C , the military way . <p> No standards were lowered for me as I climbed the Air Force ladder . I had to best one white male after another . But military leaders had designed a system that did n't let me flounder . The system zeroed in on strengths in me I was years from seeing in myself . Skillfully , it drew those out  --  partly , no doubt , because of my race and gender . <p> Beginning in basic training , I had leadership positions thrust upon me . If two trainees are sent to pull weeds , one will be placed in charge and held accountable . I was always the one . Soon , to my tearful distress , I was promoted to dorm chief , the trainee responsible for everyone else in the flight ( the Air Force version of a platoon ) . I begged to be passed over , but Tech Sergeant Harris  --  in training , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dorm chief badge at me and threw me out of his office . He spent the next few weeks berating or praising me , each at the right moment . When the flight graduated first in the squadron , I began thinking that maybe the Air Force was right . Maybe I could compete and win . <p> I did , and so do many other minorities . Consider the Army , the most integrated service and the subject of a new book , All That We Can Be : Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way , by two military sociologists , Charles Moskos and John Sibley Butler ( one white , one black , both veterans ) . The authors note that the Army is the only American institution where blacks routinely boss around whites . Of its generals , 7.3 percent are black , a critical mass of leadership approached nowhere else in society . <p> The services succeed by putting a premium on achievement . They find a way to measure everything ; in order to progress , soldiers navigate an endless stream of standardized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test taker ( I just needed backbone ) , but many other blacks struggle with exams . A " colorblind " military would leave too many black soldiers trapped in undemanding jobs while crucial positions went understaffed . <p> The military prepares all its soldiers to face the hurdles of competition . If a soldier fails an exam , he is usually offered a makeover or a remedial course and " encouraged " to attend . If he does n't , and continues to fail , he 'll end up a civilian again . If he makes the attempt , his commander will support him fully . No one , black or white , is stigmatized for initial failure or remedial effort . Only a failure to try counts against you . <p> The U.S. Military Academy Preparatory School is the Army 's ultimate commitment to its mission . Begun 80 years ago to help enlisted men pass the West Point entrance exam , it now also prepares high school grads who have no enlisted service . It is closely modeled on West Point , where two thirds of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Our curriculum is simple , " said its commandant in 1994 . " We got English . We got math . " <p> Blacks constitute 20 percent of the enrollees , and their accomplishments are formidable . According to Moskos and Butler , only 6.8 percent of cadets entering West Point in 1993 were black : Forty percent of those entered via the prep school . Recently , 94 percent of prepsters graduated with their West Point class in four years ; only 79 percent of the entire student body did . <p> The 10-month course is n't cheap for taxpayers ; estimates range from $40,000 to $60,000 per student annually . Without that investment , though , there would be far fewer black Army officers and fewer blacks competing at the highest levels . <p> Secrets of success . Military leaders face the same pressure that some of their civilian counterparts do to meet affirmative action goals . But the military sets itself apart by practicing " supply side " affirmative action . Rather than basing plans on the total number of available minorities , it develops the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There is another secret of the military 's success : taking credit for the accomplishments of subordinates . The military , long intensely competitive , has become more so as it downsizes and has fewer accolades like promotions to award . So if Eagle Squadron produces the airman of the quarter , everyone above him in the chain of command can claim leadership points on his own evaluation . When a unit produces no standouts , soldiers conclude there is a lack of leadership in the squadron . The hunt for talent in that kind of environment ca n't afford to get sidetracked by race . <p> Five years after my epiphany in basic training , this military quest changed my life again . With the ink still wet on my college degree ( earned via an Air Force " Bootstrap " fellowship ) , I stood at attention before my flight commander at Officers ' Training School while I received my first evaluation . Captain Lowery wanted me to compete for wing commander , the top spot among the 900 in training . Deja vu  --  I begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowery cut me off , slammed a pad on his desk and made me an offer I could n't refuse . Narrating ominously , he scrawled , " Despite her enormous leadership abilities and her duty of loyalty to her comrades , Dickerson feels her personal comfort and abundant free time is more important than national security ... . " <p> So I reconsidered . Given no way out , I located every competitive bone in my body and , with the captain 's support , became wing commander . Lowery took full credit . That Midwestern white boy wanted to win : The only way to do that was through his troops . Whether my race and gender were a plus or minus to him ( and those who selected me ) I do n't know . I do know that I went toe-to-toe with a bunch of white males , the best in their own flights , and won . The military knows that , while talent ca n't be manufactured , it must be molded . No one can be wasted if an organization is to be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military handles race relations more deftly than any civilian institution I 've experienced . For one thing , soldiers know why good relations matter : Without them , there 's no unit cohesion ; without unit cohesion , soldiers die . For another , the military does n't try to change hearts and minds . Racism is not cast as an evil to be erased , but as a fact of life that has no use in the military . Yes , everyone must attend " sensitivity training , " but the services eschew the " Kumbaya " quality typical of mainstream " diversity management . " <p> Unlike many universities , the military does n't punish all hate speech , only the kind that " upsets order and discipline or provokes a breach of the peace . " In 1992 , it declined to discipline a drunken airman who called an arresting MP a " nigger . " The military standard is that the MP , trained to handle far worse , could live with such booze-induced abuse . But flaunting racist beliefs is a career buster ; your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with leading or following in a multiracial organization . Uniformed racists survive in clandestine cells , shunned as losers and forced underground . But everyone is required to stow his racial baggage for the duration of the duty day . Because everyone understands the rules , soldiers take risks about race that can have a surprising payoff in unit cohesion . <p> In South Korea , I served under a daredevil Mexican-American , Lieutenant Salas , in Charlie Flight . One Sunday , several hours before dawn , we got bored . The reports were typed and filed , the Stars and Stripes crossword solved . There was nothing to do but wait for the Communist horde to swarm over the DMZ . <p> We were bantering about the upcoming squadron Halloween party and making lewd suggestions about what each person should wear . Nonchalantly , Lieutenant Salas changed the game . He suggested I tie a rag around my head and come as Aunt Jemima . Every keyboard , every phone , every conversation in the room fell silent . <p> The only woman and the only black in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for clues about how to process this radioactive taunt . Salas became fascinated with the coffee in his cup . Then the snickering began . Though still wide-eyed with shock , my buddies could n't stifle guffaws . Now Salas looked up , proud of himself . He threw me a challenging look . <p> " All right , sir , " I said . " I 'll wear a head rag and come as Aunt Jemima if you 'll dry your back off and come as an American . " I put my hands on my hips and stared him down . <p> Pandemonium erupted . Charlie Flight rolled on the floor in Caucasian delight . <p> Salas turned beet red but was man enough to laugh . He extended his hand . I shook it . When our shift ended at 6 a.m. , we all went out drinking . And Lieutenant Salas taught me to two-step . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Debra Dickerson <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Officers ' Training School . Dickerson with buddies and in a formal portrait .
