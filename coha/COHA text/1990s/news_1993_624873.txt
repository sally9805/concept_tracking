<p> PHILADELPHIA - In golf , the saying goes , drive for show , putt for dough . <p> The baseball equivalent of that phrase could be the motto for this year 's Philadelphia Phillies . Swing for show , pitch for dough . <p> For years , the Phillies scored runs at a dizzying pace . Then , they 'd turn around and give them up even faster and finish in the second division . <p> This year , the Phillies are still scoring , but the big difference is that their pitchers no longer are the human punching bags of the National League . Entering the weekend , their staff ERA was 3.42 , third best in the league . <p> " " The reason they are where they are is their pitching , " said Astros second baseman Craig Biggio . " " You can take for granted every year that they 're going to lead the league in runs scored , home runs , batting average . They always could hit . But the way their pitching staff came together this year is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough starters . Every night you play them , you know you 're going to have to score at least five runs to win because of the way they hit . Now it 's a lot tougher to get those five runs . " <p> With a 41-17 record entering the weekend , the Phillies could play .500 ball the rest of the way for manager Jim Fregosi , now in his second full season at the helm , and still win 99 games . In order for the second-place Montreal Expos to win 99 games , they would have to go 67-36  --  a .650 winning percentage . <p> Unless the Phillies collapse completely , another worst-to-first story is unfolding . Philadelphia finished last in the NL East in 1992 , going 70-92 and losing more games than any team aside from Los Angeles . This year , they have been in first place for all but one day ( April 9 ) and have a 9 1/2-game lead entering the weekend . <p> " " I 'd sure trade places with them right now , " said Astros manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead this early means all you have to do is avoid the long losing streaks . With the pitching I 've seen from them , it 's hard to see that happening . <p> " " They 've always been a good offensive club . Now they 've got some starting pitching to go with it . That 's been the difference . " <p> With their bulging muscles and scowling , surly looks on their unshaven faces , the Phillies ' hitters have attracted the attention of casual baseball fans who want to believe that offense is everything . <p> And true , the Phillies lead the league in runs , doubles , homers , slugging percentage and on-base average . <p> But if it was n't for the Phillies ' five-man starting rotation , this season probably would be spiraling down as another good-hit , no-pitch season in Philadelphia . <p> The Phillies have an eight-game winner in Tommy Greene , two seven-game winners in Curt Schilling and Terry Mulholland and a combined 9-5 mark from Danny Jackson and Ben Rivera , their fourth and fifth starters . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a remarkable 15 complete games , more than double any other staff in the league <p> What makes this rotation even more interesting is that Phillies general manager Lee Thomas , a lock for executive of the year , traded for all five of his starting pitchers . In an age when it 's routinely believed that you ca n't trade for pitching , Thomas has done it five times . <p> Schilling , who came from the Astros for since-departed Jason Grimsley last spring , calls the rotation " " The Drifters . " He says that all five of them drifted to the Phillies at precisely the right time in their careers . <p> Here 's how Thomas built a rotation that just might be the equal of the Atlanta Braves ' staff that some people wanted to ship straight to Cooperstown this spring : <p> Schilling , from Houston for Grimsley in April , 1992 . This was a deal that the Astros made because they did n't see Schilling making their club as a reliever and he was out of minor-league options . What the Astros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts over the last two seasons with the Phillies , he is 20-9 with 14 complete games . <p> Mulholland , with Charlie Hayes and Dennis Cook , from San Francisco for Steve Bedrosian and Rick Parker in July , 1989 . The Giants needed a closer to win the NL West that season , and Bedrosian was the man they wanted . Hayes and Cook are gone from the Phillies , but Mulholland has turned into an All-Star lefthander . He led the league with 12 complete games last year and has six already this season . <p> Greene , with Dale Murphy , from Atlanta for Jeff Parrett , Jim Vatcher and Victor Rosario in May , 1991 . Greene was more or less a throw-in with Murphy in this deal . After a shoulder injury last season , he is 8-0 with a 2.27 ERA this year and had a string of five straight complete games snapped Thursday against New York . <p> Jackson from Florida for Matt Whisenant and Joel Adamson in November , 1992 . The Marlins selected Jackson from Pittsburgh in the expansion draft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jackson , who was a bust as a free agent with the Cubs , is showing some of the same form he did in 1988 , when he was the Cy Young runner-up with Cincinnati . With a 5-2 record and 3.57 ERA , Jackson has become an ideal No. 4 starter . <p> Rivera from Atlanta for Donnie Elliott in July , 1992 . This was a little-noted deal , but the 6-foot-7 Rivera just might have the best raw stuff of any Phillies ' pitcher . At 24 , Rivera ( 4-3 , 4.25 ) needs more consistency , but he is capable of shutting down a team . <p> Thomas ' moves have not been confined to pitching . Some other of his more notable deals include : <p> John Kruk , with Randy Ready , from San Diego for Chris James ; Lenny Dykstra , with Roger McDowell , from New York for Juan Samuel ; David West from Minnesota for Mike Hartley ; and Mitch Williams from Chicago for Chuck McElroy and Bob Scanlan . <p> Thomas took Dave Hollins in the Rule 5 draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh and signed Mariano Duncan , Pete Incaviglia , Milt Thompson , Larry Andersen and Jim Eisenreich as free agents . <p> The result is a team of players from organizations throughout baseball that have banded together as sort of an outlaw group . They have stubble on their chins , tattoos on their arms and legs and look a little bit like a slow-pitch softball team in town for a state championship tournament . <p> But more than anything , the Phillies have fun . Andersen , who adds more to a clubhouse than perhaps any player in baseball , believes the clubhouse atmosphere is one of the main reasons for this year 's success . <p> " " This is a team that likes to have fun , likes to laugh and be loud , and we take that attitude on the field , " said Andersen . <p> " " After games , there 's 10 or 11 of us sitting around , drinking a beer and talking baseball . We 're not telling war stories , we 're talking about what happened that night and who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in that regard . " <p> " " We 're enjoying it , " said second baseman Mickey Morandini . <p> " " But I think the big thing is that we 're winning . We had basically the same guys here last year , and I do n't remember anything much being said about how wild and crazy we were then . " <p> There is no lack of leadership on the Phillies . Players from other organizations quickly realize that catcher Darren Daulton and Kruk lead the way both on and off the field . <p> " " We did n't have a real leader in Kansas City , " said Eisenreich . " " George Brett was a guy who led by example or play , but he was not a spokesperson , and I think that 's what we were lacking . <p> " " There are a lot of veteran guys here . Daulton especially , but there are others . My first day here , I did n't say anything to anyone . As I was leaving , David Hollins said , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons in which he was the whipping boy of the boo-birds in Philadelphia , Daulton had 109 RBIs last year . He drove in 50 runs in his 52 games this year and is without question the best overall catcher in baseball . <p> But he is quick to point out that Dykstra , Hollins , Kruk , Incaviglia and others are just as important to the Phillies ' offense . <p> " " We 've gotten much better support than last year , " said Daulton . " " We 've got a lot of guys who can kill you . It 's usually a different hero each game . The load is n't on just one guy . " Daulton is one of only two Phillies who have spent their entire careers in the organization ( reserve Ricky Jordan is the other ) . Because he has endured the bad times and been booed , this year 's success means that much more to him . <p> " " I was n't going to let a few loudmouths drive me out of town , " said Daulton , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kind of identify with them . A lot of frustration has built up . They 've been waiting for a winner for a long time . I 'd like to help give them one . " <p> Now that the Phillies finally have a pitching staff that can complement their offense , they are on track for their first division title since 1983 . The days of looking good at the plate and losing 10-9 are gone . The days of cashing playoff checks are around the corner . <p> Building the Phillies of ' 93 . <p> All of the Phillies ' key players except catcher Darren Daulton were acquired in trades or transactions put together by general manager Lee Thomas : <p> Wes Chamberlain , RF : Acquired in August 1990 from Pittsburgh with Julio Peguero and Tony Longmire for Carmelo Martinez . <p> Darren Daulton , catcher : Drafted by Philadelphia in the 25th round of the 1980 draft . <p> Len Dykstra , Center fielder : Acquired in June 1989 from the New York Mets with Roger McDowell and Tom Edens for Juan Samuel . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Atlanta Braves with Dale Murphy for Jim Vatcher , Jeff Parrett and Victor Rosario . <p> Dave Hollins , third baseman : Drafted from San Diego in December 1989 . <p> Danny Jackson , starter : Acquired in November from Florida for Joel Adamson and Matt Whisenant after the Marlins claimed him in the expansion draft . <p> John Kruk , first baseman : Acquired in June 1989 from San Diego with Randy Ready for Chris James . <p> Terry Mulholland , starter : Acquired in June 1989 from San Francisco with Charlie Hayes and Dennis Cook for Steve Bedrosian and Rick Parker . <p> Ben Rivera , starter : Acquired in June 1992 from Atlanta for Donnie Elliott . <p> Curt Schilling , starter : Acquired in April 1992 from the Astros for Jason Grimsley . <p> Mitch Williams , reliever : Acquired in April 1991 from Chicago Cubs for Chuck McElroy and Bob Scanlan . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : June 21 , 1993 <p> CORRECTION : Manager Jim Fregosi 's name was misspelled Fergosi in the cutline accompanying this story .
