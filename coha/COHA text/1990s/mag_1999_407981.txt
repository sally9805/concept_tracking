// A baby was born in a tepee down by the Big Shining Water . His mother wrapped him in soft , dry moss , and laid him in a little cradle . She laced the leather sides across his legs and arms until all you could see were his black hair , bright eyes , and round , baby face . His father , Many Lightnings , looked out from the tepee . According to an old Indian custom , the baby would be named for the first object the father saw . On the path lay two feathers dropped by birds passing high overhead . " His name shall be Two Feathers , " said Father Many Lightnings . " Little Two Feathers , " sang Mother-like-aRed-Rose as she rocked his cradle from side to side . " Little Two Feathers , go to sleep . " Mother-like-a-RedRose gathered up the feathers that lay upon the path . The small feather belonged to a little bird , the rail , which feeds upon the wild grass growing at the water 's edge . " Two Feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shall eat the Indian 's rice and play among the Indian 's trails as the trails run swiftly among the reeds of the marshland . " The large feather was that of the great eagle which floats high in the heavens above . Motherlike-a-Red-Rose held it up toward the sky . " Two Feathers shall climb as the eagle mounts up in the sky , " she said . " He shall pass beyond our hills , see strange sights , and bring back blessings to his people . It is in the heart of the Great Mystery and it shall be so . " Mother-like-a-RedRose hid the feathers in her buckskin bag . Each return of the birds from the Land of Summer found Two Feathers taller and stronger . He could walk in the Indian fashion , stomach in , chest up , chin in , for many miles without tiring . He could keep his canoe side by side with Father Many Lightnings ' canoe without ever making a sound as his paddle cut the water . He knew where the buffalo , the deer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Shining Water . He knew all the trails that led away from the tepees and had followed some of them to their ends . One day , Motherlike-a-Red-Rose was making a buckskin shirt for him when he arrived home . She had colored and cut porcupine quills and was sewing them into a beautiful design of red , yellow , blue , and purple . " What shapes are you making , Mother-like-aRed-Rose ? " asked Two Feathers . " Red , blue , and yellow are for flowers , " she said . " Purple is for flower shadows on the ground . I saw them in the early morning when I went to the spring for water . " " Why do you do all that work for me ? " asked Two Feathers . " Because , " his mother said , " there is one thing I want you always to remember . It is this : " All flowers are not of one color . There are flowers of red , flowers of blue , and flowers of yellow-many kinds , and each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side . It is as the Great Mystery wishes . He has made them so . " " Mother-like-a-RedRose , " said Two Feathers , thoughtfully , " I was lying in the sunshine today and suddenly a shadow fell upon me . It rested like two great wings upon the ground . " Two Feathers stretched wide his arms . Mother-like-a-Red-Rose made no reply . She was thinking of what had happened when he was a little baby in his cradle . She and Father Many Lightnings had taken Two Feathers to a meeting of friends and strangers from across the lake . They had met to promise one another that they would live as friends in peace ; to solemnly pledge that no one should wrongfully take what belonged to another ; that each one would play fair when it came to hunting grounds , ponies , wild rice , berry patches , or whatever they possessed . They would be as children sharing what the Great Mystery gave them of earth and sky . The visitors had brought peace pipes as gifts . They were long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue pipe symbolized blue skies , lakes and rivers , flying birds , and all things that live in the air above the earth . Reverently they held the pipes ; slowly , gracefully , they lifted them , while the long feathers threw shadows upon the walls like the wings of a great bird . Chanting , they passed one pipe before the assembly " On wings strong and true ... comes good unto you-Peace . " As they passed the pipe along , Two Feathers tried to grasp it , but it slipped away . Two Feathers burst into tears . A stranger , hearing his cry , came and waved the peace pipe gently above them as he sang . Then little Two Feathers looked up through his tears and smiled . " He shall be a child of peace , " Mother-like-a-RedRose had said as she held her baby close to her heart . Her thoughts were interrupted as Two Feathers continued with his story . " Mother-like-a-RedRose , " he said , as he gazed earnestly into her face , " I looked up and lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flew to a rocky cliff far above . " Rising , Mother-like-a-Red-Rose opened the buckskin bag that contained their treasures , and took out an eagle feather . " Every boy must earn his name , " she said . " You shall no longer be as the baby eaglet crying in its nest , for as the golden eagle mounts in the sky and returns again , bringing peace to her young , so shall you travel far , visit strange places , and return with blessings for your people . It is the will of the Great Mystery and it shall be so . " The next morning when Two Feathers looked into his bowl , he found a few black coals of cedar twigs instead of the customary rice . This was their way of telling him that he was ready to go alone into the forest . If he could remain there four days and four nights without eating , and then return to his tepee , they would know that he was old enough to care for himself . // Whatever animal came to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protector for life . What Indian boy would not look forward to the opportunity of proving himself ? Two Feathers ' eyes shone with eagerness . He said nothing , blackened his face with the coal , took his bow and arrow , his water bag , and a litde bag of rice which Mother-like-a-Red-Rose had placed beside them , and went out upon his way . All day Two Feathers followed his trail that led to the cliff far above . At night , he slept beneath a clump of elms that grew near the stream . The next morning was hot . Not a breath of air was stirring . At noon , a storm swept along the hillside . He saw a dark object above him . It was wet and bedraggled and flew heavily toward the cliff . As it neared the top , the clouds separated , a ray of sunshine fell upon it , and every feather was tinged with gold . " The golden eagle ! The mighty bird of fire ! " cried Two Feathers . He clambered over the rocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining above the low clouds and the air was clear and cool . The eaglet in the eagle 's nest shivered and cried for its mother . Not far away was a large hollow tree partly hidden by two huge rocks . Two Feathers climbed in the opening and lay down upon the soft decayed wood and leaves inside the tree . As he slept , he dreamed that the eagle , the mighty bird of fire , came down from heaven and perched upon the rock , peering into the darkness where he lay . Then it was no longer the eagle , but Mother-like-a-Red-Rose who stood before him , smiling and holding out the shirt she was embroidering . He looked in surprise . The red , blue , yellow , and purple quills no longer spoke of blossoms and flower-shadows , but were laid in the form of birds with wings widespread . " How is this , Mother-like-a-Red-Rose ? " he asked . " There are not only flowers of many colors , " she replied , " there are also birds of many colors . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown rail and great golden eagle . Each different-all birds , all living together in the blue sky above ! The Great Mystery has made them so . It is his will . " The next day Two Feathers spent upon the cliff , jumping from rock to rock , or climbing tall trees to see what was beyond . At night , he returned to his hollow tree and was soon asleep . Again the eagle appeared to him , and again it changed into Mother-like-a-Red-Rose , who stood before him . On the fourth day , Two Feathers went farther along the cliff . That night , his last night by himself , he smiled as he lay in the hollow tree . In the morning , he would rise early and go swiftly down the trail to his tepee by the Big Shining Water . Thinking about these things , he at last fell asleep . Once more the eagle came , and again Mother-like-a-Red-Rose stood before him . It was midday when he awoke and the sun was shining brightly . The mother eagle was calling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are a bird of fire ! A dweller in the sun ! " She spread her wings and circled above the rock . The eaglet hesitated , then followed with a slow , uncertain flight . The mother bird waited , poised upon her wings , until the eaglet had returned to the rock . Then she made a second circle , larger , higher , the eaglet following . Again and again they rose , always in larger , higher circles , until at length they were lost to sight in the far sky above . // Two Feathers ' heart was beating fast . Was he , like the eaglet , ready for his adventure ? What was the blessing he was to carry to his people ? He rose quickly and stood for a moment with his arm upraised in greeting to the sun , waiting for the voice of the Great Mystery . Then he knew what he must do . He arose and ran swiftly down a deer trail leading away from home . Hour after hour , Two Feathers made his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled across the blue sky to the west . Its last rays lit the blossoms that grew among the rocks and pointed out a flat stone on which he made ready his first meal-of acorns , berries , and water . Before eating , he called out in a clear voice . " If any brother within my hearing is hungry , let him come and eat with me . He is welcome ! " He waited a moment . There could be no answer aside from the echo in that secluded place . He lifted the water bag to his lips-then suddenly lowered it . A child stood before him ! He was not a little Indian brother ; his face was white and his cheeks were the color of a deep pink rose . His hair might have been dyed with yellow flower-feathers that grew along the trails by the Big Shining Water . His eyes were the color of the blue sky above . " Little white brother , you are welcome ! " he said . They sat side by side upon the ground and ate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pale-faced brother stretched himself out upon them and slept . Two Feathers sat by his side and thought , Why was this boy alone in the woods ? He must have wandered away from friends and become lost . Did he belong to the wide trail and the strange cities of which Mother-like-a-Red-Rose had told him ? At last Two Feathers also slept . Two Feathers was awake with the first ray of light . Then the little brother awoke , said something , and smiled . Two Feathers did not understand the words , but he understood the smile , for smiles are the same the world over . When they had eaten , they started down a narrow trail where Two Feathers had found a tiny scrap of white cloth . It probably had been torn from the boy 's shirt as he forced his way through a tangle of branches . Signs like this the Indian boy could read at a glance , for he had learned to sharpen his sight as well as his hearing . At last they reached the level prairie beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had wandered over the prairie on his way . This was the way to his home . But which way must they go ? Two Feathers opened the precious bag of rice which Mother-like-a-Red-Rose had given him and filled the white boy 's hand . He would take none himself . One meal a day was enough for an Indian lad when occasion demanded . The white child urged in vain ; then , not satisfied , he looked long at Two Feathers . Taking from his pocket a blue marble , he presented it to his new-found friend in appreciation of his kindness . The blue color reminded Two Feathers of Father Many Lightnings ' blue calumet pipe that had been given to him at one of their peace ceremonies when Two Feathers was a baby . His father had said , " Two days " journey to the north , not far from the River of Waters , rises a high cliff Here the Indian finds the blue clay from which he makes paint for coloring the blue calumet , the peace pipe . " " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sprang to his feet . The child came from the blue cliff " two days " journey to the north " ! Early the next morning , the children started across the prairie . After two days , they came to a wide trail that led to a village at the foot of a blue cliff . Taking Two Feathers by the hand , the little white brother hurried on to his home . Surprised villagers called to one another , " The child is found ! The child is found ! " A bell pealed from a steeple , calling the searchers back in from the countryside . Friends gathered about the little white brother , and his mother folded him in her arms and wept for joy . Then the white child told how he had become separated from relatives as they were returning from a distant village . They had camped by the roadside . He awoke in the early dawn . The birds were astir in the trees . Quietly , so as not to awaken the others , he had made his way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had led him on a merry chase ; then he became confused and went in the wrong direction . When he called , no one heard his voice . His people could not find him ; so after searching , they had returned to the village and spread the alarm . Now that the child was found , all were eager to show their gratitude to the Indian lad who had brought him home . That night he slept in the little white brother 's house . It had walls , floor , roof , windows , and doors ; it was closed at the top , so that no stars could look down upon them . Two Feathers thought , It 's not nearly as beautiful as my tepee home among the pines . The next morning , the pale-faced chief , the sweet-faced mother , the little white brother , and many others gathered in a house with a high , peaked roof Some spoke ; then the people rose and sang : " He is the Great Mystery : He points out a trail for the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns the lost child to his home . " Time passed quickly . Two Feathers was anxious to return to his people . He had treasures for them , given to him by his new-found friends . They went with him a day 's journey across the prairie . Then he sent them back , promising to return . Mother-like-a-Red-Rose was sitting in front of the tepee , looking out over the Big Shining Water . When would Two Feathers return ? Was all well with him ? She heard a call . " Two Feathers ! Two Feathers ! " she cried . He was soon at her side . He had gifts for all-a wonderful , pale-faced doll for his cousin Peep-of-Day , a blanket for Father Many Lightnings , and for Mother-like-a-Red-Rose , a square wooden box . She opened it . It was filled with gaily colored beads , transparent and bright . Two Feathers said nothing of what had taken place during his absence , since it might seem like boasting . But the next day , Father Many Lightnings and his braves met in council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Two Feathers was called on to give an account of his absence . // " An eagle threw its shadow over me , " he said , " and I followed it to a far-away cliff . Three nights it appeared to me in my dreams . " The braves nodded ; that was as it should be . The eagle had taken charge of Two Feathers and would be his constant guide and protector . " What next ? " they asked . " Tell us of the dreams ! " " In my dreams , " continued Two Feathers , " each night the eagle disappeared and Motherlike-a-Red-Rose stood before me holding a shirt she was embroidering in red , blue , and yellow flowers and purple flower-shadows , made from the quills of the porcupine . The flowers turned to birds and Mother-like-a-Red-Rose said , " Not all flowers are red ; some are blue ; some are yellow ; each different-all flowers ; all growing together in the meadows . It is the same with birds . The Great Mystery has made them so . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' " " What next ? " asked the braves . " I hoped to bring a blessing for my people , " continued Two Feathers . " I found only a child lost in the woods . He placed his hand in mine ; his hand was white ; my hand was red . I returned him to his people ; I found no treasure . " Two Feathers stopped speaking and stood humbly before them . Then Father Many Lightnings rose to his feet and said , " This day the voice of the mighty eagle has spoken to the red man , saying , " The Great Mystery has many people , red , white , yellow , black , brown ; each is differentbut all are people . He had made them so . It is his will that they live together in peace , sharing all things , becoming as one people . ' " You have done well , my son . Your deed is the Indian 's offer of peace to the white brothers beyond the prairie . " Then Two Feathers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened the beautiful white eagle feathers upon his headdress . It was the symbol of peace , that his great deed should not be forgotten among his people . But by his mother and father and those who knew him best , he was still called Two Feathers . In the Moon of Falling Leaves , Two Feathers led his people over the hills to the home of the white brothers . They carried with them gifts of rice , beads , seeds , and strange foods that the white men had never tasted . Before parting , the Indians sang their peace songs and gave the white brothers the pipes of peace . There they promised one another that they would live in peace ; that no one should wrongfully take what belonged to another ; that each one would play fair when it came to hunting grounds , wild rice , berry patches , houses , fields , or whatever they possessed ; and they would be as children sharing what the Great Mystery had given them of the earth and sky . And in all the years that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feathers ' tribe and the white brothers ' village was never broken . Author Affiliation Bertha Marilda Rhodes // <p>
