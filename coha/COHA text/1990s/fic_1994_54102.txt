Section : THE SOUTHERN REVIEW In August of 1791 , a large number of the black slaves of the French colony of Sainte Domingue met at the LeNormand Plantation , on the borders of the forest called Bois Cayman , to organize a revolt against their white masters . The slave uprising , which broke out a couple of weeks later , lasted for ten years and finally resulted in the independence of Haiti . <p> Within a couple years of the first rising , Toussaint L'Ouverture had emerged as the most powerful black leader , but no one knows for certain when he joined the rebellion . His presence at the meeting at Bois Cayman has been disputed . <p> All the way down into Bois Cayman , I was thinking of Macandal . We were going there , to LeNormand plantation , where he once lived , or where his death began . A white man might say he died for love-white people believe that things happen for reasons , or if they do n't believe it always , they always wish that it were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gros-bon-ange was still with les Mysteres , and my ti-bon-ange , eh , where was that ? But I knew about it , everyone knew , and as we were coming down from the mountain I knew the others would be thinking of it too . <p> In Guinee , Macandal was a Mandingue , but at Habitation LeNormand he was a slave who fed the sugar mill . He stood at the end of the line and pushed the trimmed cane through the place where the raised edges of the grinding wheels meshed together like teeth in a mouth as they pulled inward . The mules that powered the mill walked around and around at the ends of their long poles , led by yawning children , half-asleep , because at LeNormand they ran the mill at night . It 's not such hard work feeding cane into the mill , not dangerous , so long as you stay awake , but a slave who has been in the fields all day and then goes to the mill at night may grow tired and drowse and give the mill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always sing in the mills at night , to keep themselves awake , and I wonder what they were singing then , before Macandal 's scream cut through the song and someone stopped the mules , too late , when the mill had already taken his arm to the shoulder . <p> Or maybe there was no scream , maybe he never cried out at all , even when the mill ground to a stop and someone took a cane knife and cut his arm off at the shoulder to get him loose from it . And they were singing to him all the time , whatever song it was , they never stopped , and he was singing too , and kept on singing when they cut him away and his arm came out the other end of the mill with the flesh in ribbons and the bone crushed into the frayed and flattened bagasse . His blood ran down into the syrup , and somewhere in France a white man stirred it into his coffee , Macandal 's blood poisoned him , and he died . Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the mountain into Bois Cayman , I saw how he would have taken the knife himself and cut through his own arm , or gnawed it through with his Mandingue teeth like an animal will do with a leg in a trap , because once the arm was severed , he was free . No one sends a one-armed slave into the mill or the fields again . <p> Another man would have died from the wound , and seen his corps-cadavre put into the ground , but if Macandal died he was born again . They made him a herdsman . I know how it was for him , that part of it , because Toussaint let me go myself , to watch the cattle . So he was alone , out there for weeks at a time , running out of food most likely , having little water , but able to think and learn , how to live from the land , what vines to cut for water . To protect himself from the wild dogs and protect the cows , and from the maroons too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Bois Cayman where stray cattle might wander . It might not be the first time , not the second , but one time he would follow them . But he was Macandal , he would not follow , he would lead . <p> Bois Cayman is an old forest and we were in it a long time . It was a living place and we cut nothing to get through it . The paths were few and they went nowhere or just ended . Sometimes we could hear other bands moving in the jungle near us , large or small . Some seemed to know their way and passed us quickly , and there were others that we passed ourselves . Macandal would have known them all , he went from one band to another . He was everywhere on this side of the mountains , and many places on the other . He learned all that was in the forest , and learned the secrets of Guinee that the old maroons had saved for him , and he learned secrets which the caciques knew before the white people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medicines , and poisons , especially those . He gave poison to the maroons and gave it to herdsmen too , and field slaves , and house slaves finally , best of all . They killed animals in the fields with it , and of course they killed each other , and themselves sometimes . Macandal knew what we all do . Any death can hurt a white man somewhere . If it is only a slave or a cow , he is less rich . You make a man like Arnaud grow a little smaller if you only kill his dog . But soon the white people began to die in their own houses too . The slaves learned to find new poisons in the house , arsenic and lead . Then there were trials and torture and burnings , but the poisoning did not stop . Macandal filled the city of Le Cap with poison . Thousands of slaves were saving it , waiting for that single day when they planned to use it to destroy all the white people . Then the white people would be finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maroons . <p> But there was love , if it was that . Macandal went to a calenda , and they say he went to see a woman , that he would not have gone only to dance . Some say he had taken the woman off into the forest before and it was a lover of hers still on Dufresne Plantation where the calenda was held who saw him and told the gerant that he was there . They all say he , was betrayed . The white men could n't catch Macandal by themselves . But the gerant did come to know of it , somehow , and because no one had ever taken Macandal by force he used cunning . He had barrels of rum sent to the calenda , and then , when the dancers were all drunk and asleep , he tied up Macandal and took him that way . <p> So then he died again . Not easily or all at once . He broke the ropes and got away before they left Dufresne , but dogs ran him down before he could go far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is where they burned him too . Inside the fire he broke the chains that held him to the stake , but he did not walk out of the fire still in his body . The fire took his corps-cadavre , but he turned his ti-bon-ange into a mosquito and it flew away . The mosquito is still here somewhere . Many saw it . Achille says that he was there and saw it all , though he may be lying . But he says that he saw everything and that he shouted out when the others did , Macandal is free . <p> That must have been a fine calenda there at Dufresne , where Macandal was taken , or he would not have come , but I do n't think even it could have been so big as the one we danced at Bois Cayman . At once I could see that the people must have come from plantations all over the northern plain , and there were as many as at the market in Le Cap . Thousands  --  and that is only the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the drumming . It was rada drumming we heard first , though both rada and petro drums were there . It was thick dark by the time we came near , but we could feel more and more people moving around us in the jungle , and when we began to come into the clearing it seemed that there were even more people than trees . There were more and more people coming out of the jungle all the time , and it looked like the trees were giving birth to men . <p> Boukman and his people made a big hounfour in the clearing . No altar sheds , but at the center of the peristyle they had topped a straight tree and left the peeled trunk standing for a poteau mitan . Damballah and Aida Wedo were wrapped in a painted spiral around it to the ground . There were forty young hounsis all dressed in white , and a mambo whose name I never learned , though she was as big as two houses . I looked around and saw at the edge of the clearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damballah must live there because a bowl of milk and egg had been put there for him to eat , nailed up in a crate so no one but Damballah could slither between the slats to eat his food . <p> Damballah had not raised his head or come out of where he lived in the tree , but in the peristyle the hounsis sang a song for him while they clapped their hands and rolled their hips with the drumming . <p> We come from Guinee We have no father We have no mother Marassa Eyo ! <p> Papa Damballah , show us Show us Dahomey again .... <p> Then Tullius came . I do n't know how he found us among so many , but he did . He went first to Mirabelle and linked his arm in hers to turn her once around , then he put his hand on her belly and praised it . Mirabelle ducked her head and smiled into her hand with her eyes shining . The child was two months off , and could be seen . Tullius greeted Achille , who stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring fiercely all around . He had to look as fierce as he could or he would have felt himself shrinking with so many other houngans in this place . Then Tullius came to me and Jean-Pic and we touched each other and we told him the name of the new man , who had run away from Arnaud 's plantation . Bienvenu , we called him . It was what he called himself , though we did n't know if this had been his name when he was a slave in Arnaud 's cane field . <p> When I looked at Bienvenu then I still saw him as he had looked before , wearing the headstall and thrashing his head around like a wild cow crazed for water . The stall was gone now , and the only signs of it were a thick weal healing pink across the back of his neck and some hook-shaped slashes where the tin collar had cut him each time he hung the prongs up , running through the jungle . Bienvenu was telling Tullius what had happened and what I , Riau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in lianas , waiting for the dogs , and how he heard us coming , Riau and Jean-Pic , and heard Jean-Pic tell Riau that he should kill him . <p> Bienvenu believed that Riau would do what Jean-Pic had said , or else he would be left there for the dogs . He knew that there was no love between maroons and slaves , and that the maroons did not trust the slaves who ran away to them , thinking that they might be spies who would deliver them all to the white people again . But still , the maroons must have been slaves themselves sometime , except the ones who were born in the mountains . Anyway there was nowhere else for Bienvenu to run , and he had seen that if he stayed on Arnaud 's plantation he would surely die . Then he would rather die in the jungle , and he thought that he would rather be killed by Riau 's cane knife than wait for the dogs to find him there . So when he heard the knife blade go humming up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return his grosbon-ange to les Mysteres . . . . <p> I had heard all that too many times to listen again , so I was talking to the man who 'd come with Tullius , Vergil was his name . I asked him how many had come from Le Cap , and he told me there were many . In the city too the word had passed from houngan to houngan , hounfour to hounfour , the same as all over the plain . There were maroon bands from everywhere in the island too , even a band from Bahoruco , over beyond the torches on the far side of the peristyle . <p> I stood on my toes and craned my neck to look for the Bahoruco maroons , whom I had heard much about but never seen . People said that they had a big fortress in ancient caves the caciques had used , and where the gods of the caciques still lived . Somewhere they must have found a great power , the people said , because they had fought a war with the white people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country and write a paper that said that it was theirs . So I was looking hard to see these strong maroons , while Vergil tried to show them to me , but before I could see them there was a stir in the crowd and someone came through handing out papers . <p> No one could read but still everyone was reaching for the papers and some were fighting over them . Except Riau . I , Riau , did n't want a paper , not this night . But Vergil got one and clutched it in his hand . It was a single sheet , but made to look like a page of a journal . No one knew till a long time later that these papers were false and that Toussaint had got them to be printed . Vergil ran his eyes up and down it , sticking his lips out like a kiss . He was holding it sideways so the words dropped down in columns instead of running in rows like they should . He gave the paper to Riau then , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters were rattling like chains linked together on the paper . They wanted to start speaking to Riau , but I threw the paper down . Tullius picked it up and glared at me , because he knew . <p> Just the same the words began to talk . on the edge of the peristyle , a big Ibo field hand lifted a smaller mulatto onto his shoulders . The mulatto wore rich man 's clothes and had a funny freckled face . Tullius shifted beside me . <p> " I do n't like to see him here , " he said . " He has a white father . " <p> Of course it was plain that he had a white father , like any homme de couleur , but what Tullius meant was that he had a father who protected him and gave him property , and that probably he owned slaves . I was near enough to see his face well . Except for his pale skin and his funny spots he had the face of a man of Guinee , but the expression of a white man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But he opened his mouth and the paper spoke through him . <p> The paper said that the King In France had made a new law for the slaves here , we . The new law was that there would be no more whippings now . Abolition du fouet  --  there was shouting when the paper put these words in that mulatto 's mouth . And the law said that the colons must give us three days free each week , Sunday and two others , to rest or work for ourselves in our provision grounds . And for this ' the shouting was even louder than for what the paper had to say about the whip . <p> The white people would say that we were foolish to believe these things the paper said . Sometimes it happens to one of us , too , the good blood of Guinee drains out , a man becomes old and pale to transparency and he ca n't know what to believe anymore at all . But it was easy to believe what the paper said then . The King In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the Code Noir , which said that our masters must feed us , and limited our work , and outlawed the worst punishments , but many of the colons did not obey this law . Lately there were new laws about the colored people , but the colons would not obey these either . <p> Also , some of the people then at Bois Cayman had been kings in their own country . It was not hard for them to believe that these white people would go against the right of a king . Some said that the white people had made the King a prisoner in France and that they sent him to work in French fields every day with his family . Some said that the King In France was a black man and came out of Dahomey like ourselves . <p> Boukman stood up . He did not need to sit on anyone 's shoulders to be seen , he was head and shoulders above the rest , standing on the ground . He wore white trousers and a red sash with a sword in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lower part of his face hung over his bare chest like an open door . Before he spoke we all could feel his esprit . It was not one loa riding him that night , but all les Morts et les Mysteres . <p> Boukman told then that the King In France would send his army over the sea to make the colons obey his law . But that we , the people of Guinee , must not wait for the King 's army to cross the ocean . We would rise and claim the new law for ourselves . <p> Then Boukman looked at the petro drummers and they began to beat . The la-place began going backward around the poteau mitan , as if he would undo time and bring us home to Guinee where we came from . It was Jeannot who was dancing la-place that night , and as he moved backward the hounsis began to sing to Legba , as we must always do at the beginnings of things . <p> Papa Legba open the way for me When I have passed I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Legba came to ride Jeannot . I watched carefully because it is rare . Jeannot toppled back and the hounsis caught him and when he could stand again he was Legba , Legba grown old , crippled , walking on broken legs , his arms twisted in deformity , his whole self crushed down under the weight of the big macoutte he has to carry as far as the end of the world . The hounsis sang . <p> Attibon Legba , limping along It 's a long time since we have seen you I will carry Legba 's macoutte Put his straw sack on my back .... <p> Legba was coming toward where we were standing now , and in his face I saw Grand Bois D'Ilet , master of the Island Below Sea , where the loa live among les Morts et les Mysteres . He was coming down , down into the mirror himself , already Legba could see his shadow rising there . A step ahead of me , Achille stiffened and dropped his gun as he was taken , but it was not Ghede this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong again for the loa , the muscle throbbed across his back as he lifted his arms in the shape of a cross , ridden by Mait'Carrefour . <p> Legba , Grand Bois , Legba , inside Jeannot 's body Legba saluted Carrefour with his sly smile . These loa know each other well , because they both sit on the gate . Legba opens the way for the day loa , but the night demons all pass through the hand of Mait'Carrefour . So they can not always agree , but tonight they smiled on each other like brothers , and danced with each other , hand in hand . I did n't see Ghede , not yet , but I knew he was there , below the bright surface of the mirror that turns your image back , his hand now holding Carrefour 's other hand . The hounsis sang . <p> O Creole , sonde miroir , O Legba . . . <p> By my side Vergil trembled as Baron Samedi mounted him . He stepped forward to join Legba and Carrefour , dancing around the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Riau 's head . Yo di , the mirror breaks through rock . The ocean is mirror , mirror is ocean , by day we see ourselves in it , but when it turns transparent then we see through into the Island Below Sea , which is the world of death , where les Morts et les Mysteres reach up into our world , climbing Grand Bois 's tree from the dark side of the mirror . They were shooting up the poteau mitan now , as fast as the veves written in gunpowder could burn . Now I saw Ghede dancing everywhere in the peristyle , one , two , many Ghedes . The drum scratched at the inside of Riau 's head , ogun wanting his body to dance , wanting his gros-bon-ange to make way for ogun . But I wanted my own head for thinking with , and so I stepped away , moving somewhere I could not hear the drums so well . <p> But the forest itself was crowded with esprit . I walked in the shadows just outside the tree line , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling the poteau mitan . There were so many to be drawn up from the Island Below Sea . I knew that our living people outnumbered the whites ten to one . The white people knew it too and were afraid  --  this was the fear that drove the whip . But what the white people never suspected was that every one of us they killed was with us still . And by this time they had killed so many , a hundred to our one . A dead white person disappears , but our dead never leave us , they are here among les Invisibles . They were coming now , all les Invisibles , through the mirror from below the waters , and every tree in Bois Cayman became a poteau mitan for their arrival . <p> Walking around the edge of the clearing I came to Damballah 's tree , and there I stopped and squatted down . Damballah came out of the hole in his tree . No one was watching him , only me . He crawled between the bars of the crate and put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split tongue flicked in and out of the egg and milk , trying it before he drank . His scales were dark and glossy on his back , and his small round eye shone when it looked at me . I raised my head then and I saw Toussaint , hunkered down on the other side of the crate . I do n't know when he had come there . Jean-Francois and Biassou were sitting a few yards in back of him , talking together in low voices . I could n't hear what they said . <p> Later , a long time afterward , people said different things about what Toussaint was doing that night . Some say he led the ceremony himself and cut the black sow 's throat with his own hand . Some say he never went to Bois Cayman at all . I know that he was there . Who knows what is true ? Maybe he was there , or not there , but I know that I saw him , if few others did . All the time they were feeding the loa he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Mon oncle , " I said . I was the first to speak . <p> Toussaint nodded . I could see his face plain in the torchlight from the peristyle . His mouth was pursed slightly like he was whistling and his eyes looked cheerful , torchlight flashing in them . Like always he wore the bandanna tied around his head and he wore the green coat with the old bloodstains . He looked like he had been squatting there for a year , but I was surprised to see him there at all , because I thought that he served Jesus , who had made him swear against serving the loa . <p> " Well , Riau , " he said . " What are you thinking ? " <p> " I was thinking about Macandal , " I said . When I said this , I knew where my thought had gone . Macandal was with us now , he had come up the poteau mitan at the head of les Invisibles . And with Macandal leading , the white people must die . They were singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bomba Canga , bafio te ! Canga , moune de le ! Canga , do ki la Canga , li ! <p> The mambo stood up , all stained with blood from the sacrifice . Boukman was mixing blood with gunpowder and clairin to feed the loa , and most of the people were pressing forward to get some , whether the loa had mounted them or not . Jeannot raised his cup above his head and screamed into the sky before he drank , but I , Riau , I did not taste the blood that night . <p> Toussaint was looking at me as he would do when I was small , when I had understood something and he was trying not to show his pleasure . Then he turned his head to watch what was happening in the peristyle . In the torchlight I could just see the tips of his teeth . A big mosquito landed on his broad flat cheek and fastened itself to feed . <p> " You know what happened to Macandal , " he said . " The white people burned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own people who gave him up to the whites . " <p> " Do you think Macandal is like Jesus ? " I said . " You are wrong . " <p> Now Toussaint smiled a little , openly . He felt the mosquito , finally , and flicked his finger at it . He did n't kill it though . Maybe he did n't mean to kill it . The mosquito lifted , whining high above his head , and vanished in the dark . <p> " I know what happened to Macandal , " I said . " Macandal turned himself into a mosquito , yo di . Who knows ? Maybe this is the mosquito who has bitten you . " <p> <p> By MADISON SMARTT BELL <p>
