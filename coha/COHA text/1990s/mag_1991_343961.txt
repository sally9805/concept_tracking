The former Supreme Court Justice William Brennan used to tell his clerks , " Five votes can do anything around here . " That was in the days when Brennan regularly stitched together a narrow liberal majority on a high bench that was delicately balanced between left and right . Those days are over . Five votes can still do anything . But now it 's the court 's increasingly assertive right wing that usually has them  --  and sometimes more . <P> As the court heads toward the conclusion of its latest term , it has finally completed its decades-long transformation from the liberal bastion of former Chief Justice Earl Warren into an aggressively conservative body  --  one that seems poised to alter some of the major rulings of the past . To fellow conservatives , the right-wing majority may look like the cavalry galloping to the rescue . Battered liberals are more apt to see them as the ravaging horsemen of the Apocalypse . The only question is how far they will go in undoing the liberal legacy in such areas as church-state relations , individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The new majority , led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist , has been building in slow motion . In the early 1970s , during Rehnquist 's first few terms on what was still a liberal-leaning bench , he was so isolated that his clerks took to calling him the Lone Ranger . These days he no longer rides alone : he routinely joins a group that includes Reagan appointees Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Sandra Day O'Connor and Bush appointee David Souter . Having written only a few rulings since joining the court this term , Souter remains something of an , enigma ; yet he has clearly provided the right wing  --  spearheaded by Rehnquist and Scalia  --  with a crucial fifth vote in a number of important cases in which his predecessor Brennan would almost certainly have been on the opposing side . <P> Nor are the conservatives strictly limited to those five votes . Byron White is likely to join them on some cases , often those involving criminal law and police powers . Even John Paul Stevens supports them on many free-speech issues . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest members of the court , as its only unbudging liberals . " The swing Justices no longer control the outcome , " says Duke University law professor Walter Dellinger . " There 's no swing Justice , really . " <P> For years the court spared lawmakers the hard task of resolving difficult issues like abortion and school desegregation by imposing solutions in a constitutional wrapping . The new court is far more likely to toss such explosive matters back to state legislatures and Capitol Hill . " We 're playing a rearguard action just trying to keep what we have , " says California Democrat Don Edwards , who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights . " Congress has to do the work we had counted on the court to do . "
