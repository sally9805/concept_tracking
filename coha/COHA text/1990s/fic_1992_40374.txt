I remember little of my father from the time we all lived together in Hollywood , and only a few disturbing moments from that period , including the afternoon when he took out after another car that had in passing splattered ours with muddy water from the gutter . He was suddenly furious , as though he had been injured or insulted . What he planned to do when he caught up with the offender I did n't know , but I saw that he was all the more determined , fiercer in his pursuit , for my mother 's high-pitched objections from the passenger seat  --  as our car , a Ford sedan , hit the hazardous dips of the cross streets and barreled forward . I think I felt that my mother was over-reacting , more fearful than need be , and was feeding my father 's rage , but I did not know about alcohol then and so assumed that she saw the peril more clearly than I , on my feet in the back seat like a charioteer and more entertained than frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the living room on Western Avenue . The floor lamp is at his right , out of place , pulled from behind the couch to illuminate the card game he plays with our guests  --  childless , unfettered friends my parents knew from high school . My father lifts his arm suddenly to thwart some attempt to calm him down , make peace , and the lamp goes over with the gesture . I hear raised voices , conciliatory , then pandering , before an abrupt , intimidated silence . The room is tipped upside down in the spilled light . <p> Here again it is my mother 's reactions that stay more acutely with me , her keening moan of desperation , her see-what-you've-done-now despair . She , who would go to any lengths for the sake of appearances , suddenly surrendered and began wildly overstating her embarrassment , goading my father 's temper , I think , and feeding his penchant for making scenes , on those card-playing nights of the Depression . <p> Otherwise , my father seemed to be laughing most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , in the few , brief years before the divorce . I can recall his teasing sense of well-being , his self-satisfaction , fixed on my mother , and the long , heavy hours of sudden , untimely slumber : eventless Sunday afternoons , when after some aborted pastime I was obliged to honor an uncommon , unreasonable quiet . <p> Then he was gone , his absence hardly noted in the abrupt change in our circumstances . My mother was at work now , and my grandmother was running the house  --  or the succession of houses we  --  shared with her and with my working aunts , sometimes my uncle , and finally , for a while , a stepfather . <p> And then , after several years , he was back . <p> He was in uniform , in the Army , a sergeant , and he was leaving town . It was early summer and I was not in school . The kids , my brother and sisters , were somewhere , I do n't know where . Perhaps it was not summer vacation but Easter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother on the phone . The phone was in the hall , on a small , cluttered desk invariably lacking a pencil , with a chair in front of it , though my grandmother did not sit down . She wore a patterned pinafore apron , blue ; it was damp from her interrupted work at the sink or at the tubs on the back porch . I can only think she was torn over how to handle this emergency . <p> " He 's here and he wants to take Conrad to the beach , " she said to my mother at her office across town . It was gloomy in the hall , as it always was when the bedroom doors were closed . My father stood in the door to the den , taller than anyone I knew , blocking light from that source , too . My grandmother did not turn the light on . <p> " No , he does n't seem like it , " she said . <p> " Could I speak to her ? " my father said . <p> My grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her wrists where suds had climbed when she 'd dried her hands . <p> " I had one beer at lunch , " my father said , as though my mother were being unreasonable . " A beer . " <p> I sat down on the third step from the bottom of the narrow staircase that led to the rooms above . I knew that some higher order of things regulated my fate now , some jurisdiction where I did n't belong exclusively to my mother and my grandmother anymore , and where their preferences could be overruled . He was my father , after all , if currently underprivileged and in disgrace , and was thereby entitled to the sympathy and the subordination of my protectors , female . Still , I had the dim hope that my mother might prevail , would say a firm no , from the obstinate streak I knew she possessed . <p> " But I 'm sober and I 'll stay sober while he 's with me , " my father said . My grandmother swatted him with her dish towel , good-naturedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to lighten things up . <p> " Tell her I 'll behave , " my father said , recognizing an ally . And then , turning to me , addressed the jury : " But I 'm leaving for a while and I just thought I might like to go to the beach for once with one of my kids , for Christ 's sake . " <p> I could not hear my mother on the other end of the line , and yet I have no doubt about what she said : " I 'm pretty busy just now , Mama , " as though she recognized my grandmother 's divided loyalty and was feeling out-numbered , overruled . This was not indifference or callous disregard but simply the truth . Our welfare depended on my mother 's salary now . Which we knew , my brother , my sisters , and I. Our mother 's attention during the day , in our larger behalf , was owed elsewhere , even if we did not always temper our emergencies to that priority . <p> As she listened to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she was sure Edward was a good man and would take good care of me . If she looked as though she doubted her own argument , it was because she understood our conflicting feelings fully , and her heart went out to all three of us . <p> " But I want him to give Conrad five dollars , in case something happens  --  right now , in front of you , Mama , so he 'll have money to get home at least , or to phone . " <p> When my grandmother hung up and repeated this codicil to my father , he said , " For crying out loud . " <p> At the beach it was not warm or crowded enough to be summer , and the briny smell , like laundry soap and sulfur , was caustic ; the wind was blowing . <p> We stayed for a while in my father 's borrowed car and stared at the wind-combed sand . The car belonged to a woman , I suspected . Someone who kept it clean , anyway , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wint-O-Green . <p> My father said that maybe we would n't go swimming after all , maybe we 'd just walk along the Strand . He asked whether I wanted to see the apartment building where he and my mother honeymooned when they got married . It was called the Ocean Arms . It was right across the street ; we did n't even have to leave the car . He pointed out the very room where he and my mother had stayed . <p> " She took the afternoon off , " he said . " And I was n't working . " He was speaking of their wedding day . <p> They had liked the Ocean Arms for its Spanish arch over the entrance , for a living-room tapestry of dancing gypsies deep in the woods , held up by iron rings at the top , and for a wrought-iron grille over the front window , which was leaded , with sections of colored glass . ( I 'd heard about all this before , from my mother , from my grandmother . ) <p> " We lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were a lifetime and all anyone could expect of paradise . Then he reached to the heart of his nostalgia : " I had a straw hat that was really quite the thing . " <p> My mother always spoke of him as " a dresser , " as though looking for something to explain it all , to make some sense of it . Four kids . <p> I liked the past and did n't mind this information , but I was not as interested as I was at home in our dining room , when my mother opened her hope chest ( the heavy relic of her life with my father and the one off-limits in the house which I respected ) and a world before my own emerged in the form of folded scarves and strange lapel pins , beads and thick letters and flaking snapshots , and posed , tinted portrait pictures of remote and unrecollected people , people in their youth looking older than they would today , serious , formal , preliminary people , fixed in receding time and smelling of cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father was not entitled to his side of our history anymore ; he was dealing in stolen goods when he presumed to speak of our past . <p> " But the sound of the sea made her nervous , " he said . " She wanted things set  --  I understand that . I wanted things special . She 'd get embarrassed by things , little things . For instance , everyone came down on Sundays because we had the beach . But only tenants could use the showers , which made your mother feel ashamed . " <p> The building was now painted turquoise . A cardboard sign in the ground-floor front-room window read ROOMS . The wrought-iron grillwork remained , but the leaded patterns and the colored glass were gone . <p> " You thirsty ? Want a Coca-Cola or something ? " <p> A block from the Ocean Arms was a flat-faced market , and before it a dented red refrigerator box with cold drinks . My father opened a Hires for me on the rusty lip of the cap receptacle and went into the market counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky Lager . <p> He tucked his sergeant 's cap under his belt and put his foot up on a crate half filled with empties . He leaned his elbow on his elevated knee . <p> " Your mother should have come down with us today , " he said . He held his beer before him thoughtfully , as though his right to it were without question , as if broken promises were inevitable . <p> " She does n't like the beach , " I said , feeling at once that my tone might sound too in-the-know and challenging . My mother was beautiful ; she was easygoing , and could , in my experience , be persuaded in almost any direction . But she had positions , out of nowhere and seemingly on small points , and she held to them stubbornly . For example , she hated the beach . It was sandy , too far to go , too much trouble . She burned . <p> My father took a long swallow of beer . " I guess not , " he said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Strand . He nodded then , as though he felt some gesture were required , some conclusion . " Funny , " he said . " It does n't seem to have changed all that much . " <p> I looked up and down the street as well , in case my opinion of the neighborhood was pertinent . <p> " You get good grades in school ? " my father asked . <p> " Pretty good , " I said , embarrassed for him , his remark so parental , obligatory . <p> " Just pretty good ? " <p> " I guess . " <p> My father cleared his throat , looking for the right voice , as if he had n't intended to get businesslike but the issue was too important to ignore . " Well , work on your grades and keep them up there , " he said . <p> In another swallow he had almost finished his beer . " What do you play ? Do you play  --  what ? Basketball ? " <p> " They play kickball at my school , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , an effort to cover up , slide by the abyss . <p> " You play , do n't you ? " <p> We were addressing the mystery of the ball , and I was at a terrible , threatening loss . I shook my head . <p> " How 's that ? " my father asked , baffled but concerned , squinting at me . <p> " I 'm not very good , " I said , recognizing in this admission a glaring want of character . <p> " Well , that 's the way you get good , " my father said . " By playing . " He seemed relieved to have found what to say to me . " Ball . " <p> " I do n't like it , " I said . I was down to the foam of my root beer . <p> " You should play , Conrad , " my father said . <p> " I put out the yellow flags , " I said . <p> " The what ? " <p> " They tell when recess is just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And your time is running out . " <p> My father said nothing . He might have been wondering what to say next , he might have been through with the conversation , but I felt the interrogation continuing , more pressing for his silence . <p> " At a quarter to one someone has to put out the yellow flags , " I said . " That tells everyone if they have to go to the bathroom or clean up their area , they have fifteen minutes left . " <p> " You do that instead of play ? " my father said . <p> I said nothing . I might plead the importance of my charge , but I had my mother 's integrity and would claim no distinction that another failed to grant me freely . <p> " I was a quarterback when I went to school , " my father said . " That 's how your mother met me . " <p> " I 've seen the picture of you , " I said , envisioning the cedar-smelling staged photo of a high school celebrity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room  --  shown me too often , too pointedly , I thought , trying to do my father justice and make sure I got the image of him that she herself had fallen for . This she did as faithfully as she sent me to Sunday school and to violin lessons , and in the same spirit  --  for my greater good , else she be charged with bias or neglect . <p> " She ever talk about me ? " my father asked , and I knew that the subject had traveled beyond me , a duty stop , to the destination it was headed for all along . <p> I was relieved , of course , that my rank on the play-ground was no longer being investigated and that I 'd slipped past the theosophy of ball without being further disgraced . But I felt awkward , as you do when you have mistaken someone 's waving at you across a distance  --  when you 've quickened , perhaps even brightened a little , and lifted your hand to respond  --  only to see that happy look spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fool then , and cheated , as you witness the reunion made in heaven you almost interrupted . <p> " She said she does n't want me to dislike you or anything , " I said . " Or hold anything against you . " <p> He had brought a quart of whiskey , which he left in the paper bag , the bag held tightly around the neck of the bottle , and he drank as we walked along the Strand , his bathing suit wrapped up under his arm . I carried our towels , my grandmother 's reminder at the last minute . I wore my bathing suit under my pants . <p> Then he said he was tired of walking . <p> We crossed the sand and sat down by the water . <p> He saw that the cuffs of his Army pants were filled with sand and he cursed , lightly , to himself , as though I were n't there . He opened his belt , because the buckle cut into his stomach now , doubled up as we were . He threw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , and then he lay back and fell asleep . <p> A gathering of gulls had settled into the sand upwind , and occasional feathers blew against my father and stuck to his khaki , as though he had been punctured and his stuffing were coming out . Sometimes I reached to pull them off , these soft , curly innards , and sometimes I did n't . <p> Every few minutes the surf cracked at my back with he sound of a whip , and when I looked around , I could see a whooping spray thrash backward , like a mane over the breakers . After a while I took the bottle of whiskey by its brown neck ; the bag lifted with it . It was heavy enough to be not empty yet , and smelled of khaki and cigarette smoke and moustache and neck . It was , as I knew it would be , warm when I drank , like something that should not be consumed . I put the bottle back where I found it , having tasted my father and my own stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His legs stabbing a fountain of clear fire up over his body . He had awakened with the desire to swim after all , and now he vanished beneath the surf . <p> I went in only as far as the water wrapped my waist . <p> The sun had fallen to the horizon , and the surface of the water was blinding . The tide had gone out while my father slept , and the breakers were louder than ever and sudden and shallow , if not fierce . The wind had stopped , though , and the cool evening air on our shoulders made the water seem warm enough . <p> He came back toward me . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " Ca n't you swim ? " <p> " I can but I do n't want to , " I said . I stood with one hand held up o my eyes to protect them from the glare of the sun . I could see my father only when a wave broke the reflection and cast a shadow , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I might return to our towels , but a pair of dark surf fishermen had appeared on the beach , and for some reason I was reluctant to pass them . <p> My father , riding a wave , surfaced beside me . He lifted me up and carried me farther out , without asking , marching through the crackling edges of incoming water . <p> " I do n't like it , " I said tightly . <p> He held me up as a wave pulled under us ; we continued out . <p> " Please . " <p> " Come on . " <p> " I do n't want to . " <p> " Just jump when they  --  just hold your breath and squat down . " <p> " Do n't be a baby . " <p> His body was slippery , and I could not hold on . I felt also some other prohibition against my clinging , some manners or taboo . <p> " Hold your nose ! " I heard his wet laughter against my ear . " I said open your eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a muzzle clamped over my nostrils . <p> " I ca n't ! " <p> " I got hold of you ! " <p> " No ! " <p> " This one we 'll jump , and see  --  " <p> We did . <p> "  --  how easy it is ? " <p> I felt the buoyant lift , the possibility of pleasure , trust . <p> " See ? " <p> " I want to go back . " <p> " What fun it is . " <p> " Yeah , but . " <p> " You 'll get used to it . " <p> My teeth were so tightly locked together that I took in no water when the wave hit : and I was pushed down and torn from my father 's hands . I bounced against the bottom and hit the top again almost immediately , surprised at my survival and a bit exhilarated , to find the surf suddenly still , covered with a hissing froth that moved in every direction at once . I felt myself riding it , a spinning marble racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surf fishers . <p> But my father was gone and I had no foothold . <p> My neck tightened to keep my head above water , and twisted as another sudden locomotion struck me from behind , smashing me like a giant paw . I sprawled into the depths again , feet over head in a black cartwheel ; my head struck sand . I fell over on my arm , on my back , and again over and upside down . <p> I came to the surface crying , put my feet down , and stood . I fell and crawled and staggered up the sand yelling no to my father , who was pursuing me , calling my name and swearing . <p> He stood over me , his hand on my shoulder . He was breathing loudly . I was shuddering . I felt him quivering in the cold . <p> " Rip , huh ? " one of the surf fishers said . " I seen you out there . " <p> The other one said , " This time of year . " <p> We walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , through the evening light along the surf 's edge , a golden dust rising from the breakers . The sun , which was out of sight , sank in the sand at our feet , the last of the moist dye of day . My father 's strides were long and enthusiastic , and promised You 're going to like this place . <p> " If it 's still there , that is , " he said . " I do n't know if it 's still even there . " <p> He was thinking about my mother again . <p> " Even after we had moved away , we 'd come back down for our dinners sometimes , " he said . " To have the best steak and seafood dinners I ever ate . Do you like steak ? " <p> " No . " <p> " You do n't like steak ? " <p> I did n't answer . <p> The bar was through an arch to the right of the door from the beach . I could see a dining room in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairs were stored under fake palm fronds , beyond a bare , dusty dance floor reflecting the light of a jukebox living there in the dark , a glowing troll . The place was called The Palms and was on the Strand where the pier began ; it had an L-shaped counter under a low roof around a large grill . <p> We took the one booth in the bar section , and when we sat down , I could see , out the windows over my father 's head , the purple sky where the sun had gone . The table wiggled when I put my elbows on it . <p> " It 's the wrong time of year , " my father said . <p> He sighed , a blunt , naked statement of his disappointment . " Or early , maybe . " Other than a man in the dining room , we were the only customers . " Me and your mother used to come here all the time . " <p> Beyond the counter , by the grill , I could see a black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were New Year 's Eve or Halloween . He hit a flat bell with the palm of his hand as we sat down , as though summoning someone from the dining room , where Hawaiian music was playing . <p> My father said , " How are the steaks tonight , Cooky ? " <p> The cook said , " Yes , sir , the steaks are real good . " He rang the bell again , smiling vaguely at nothing . <p> " You would n't kid me , would you , Cooky ? " <p> " The waitress will be right with you , sir , yes , sir . " <p> My father reached to the counter for a menu , a typed page under clear plastic , ringed in black leatherette . " Do you like a New York steak ? " he asked . " Or a Spenser steak , or a filet mignon , which is four dollars . " <p> Then , " What 's this here steak , Cooky , this here house steak , is that any good ? " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real good steak . " He rang the bell for the waitress again . <p> " Why do n't we have two of them house steaks then , " my father said , folding up the menu . <p> Then , " How do you like your steak ? Rare ? Medium ? " <p> The cook hit the bell again , sharply . He had been listening to the radio when we came in , and now he turned it down . <p> " Medium rare or what ? " <p> I looked around to the bar for the waitress . For some reason my father did n't seem to understand that we needed the waitress before our order was official . <p> " Or well done ? Do you like your steak well done ? " <p> " I guess so , " I said . <p> " Or medium rare ? That 's the way I like mine . " <p> " I guess , " I said . <p> " Medium rare , " my father said to the cook . " And we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waitress came in from the dining room . She was flipping pages in her pad as she approached us . " Salad with my prime rib , " she said over her shoulder to the cook . My father repeated his order to her , adding french fries . " And I 'll have a beer . " <p> He said to me , " Do you like milk , or what do you have with your dinner at home  --  Hires root beer , or what ? " <p> " Coca-Cola . " <p> " Ginger ale , " the waitress said , looking up as two men came in from the Strand . <p> " They only have ginger ale here , " my father said . <p> " Ginger ale , " I said , recognizing the new arrivals as the surf fishers we had seen earlier . <p> " He 'll have milk , " my father said to the waitress , who gave the cook a page from her pad and proceeded toward the surf fishers settling in at the counter , putting their tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wall . They ordered beers . <p> One of the surf fishers put a large red thermos onto the counter when the waitress had gone . " You want to fill this with more of that chowder there , Henry " he said , moving the thermos to within reach of the cook . " Before we go . " <p> My father was quiet , even when the waitress came back with everyone 's beer . Then , suddenly , loudly , he said to the huddled backs of the fishermen , " Anytime I go out the only thing biting is the goddamn groupers . " <p> The fishermen looked over from the counter . One nodded , the other shook his head . One was drinking his beer from the bottle , the other slowly pouring his into a tipped glass to regulate the foam . They were both hunched over , leaning as though into a fire ; they were pulled from that warmth by the necessity of responding to my father , and I could see that they were eager to return to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Sunday fisherman either , " my father said , as the waitress set two silver urns down before us . " I know fishing . " The urns contained chipped ice and clear glass dishes of red sauce , chunks of pale flesh protruding , looking like carnage , something from first-aid class , civil defense . <p> My father was quiet for some time ; then he turned back to me and our meal . He picked up the baby fork sticking out of the ice as though he were already angry at something . He wagged the fork at the backs of the men at the counter , at the cook prodding our steaks on the grill beyond . <p> " This last time , " he said . " This last time  --  " <p> The men looked around , but only briefly . <p> " This goddamn manta ray , this goddamn manta ray  --  ? " My father 's mouth was full . " Comes along and takes my line and snaps it right off . " <p> " You got that chowder , Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet . <p> Once more my father turned back to me , finishing his shrimp cocktail . " Why are n't you eating ? " <p> " I 'm eating . " <p> " I do n't see you eating ... " <p> I said nothing . I could hear the cook 's radio program . <p> The other surf fisher got to his feet also as the waitress brought them their full thermos and their check . They finished their beers on their feet . <p> " Hey , " my father said to the waitress , extending his empty beer bottle to her . " Buy those two men over there a drink , will ya ? " <p> The surf fishers gave my father a sidelong look . One picked up his tool kit ; the other went for their poles . <p> My father was getting to his feet , reaching for his wallet . " What are you drinking there , boys ? Tell this lady here what you 're drinking . " <p> " Never mind , thanks , " one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to buy you one . " <p> " We 'll catch you another time , soldier , " the other one said . <p> " If you reach low enough , eh ? " my father said , sinking back to the booth again , laughing . <p> The cook hit the bell on his counter with his heavy fork . I could see that our steaks were ready . <p> The waitress brought my father another beer . <p> I watched our plates steaming on the counter . <p> The waitress lit a cigarette and leaned against a pillar in the back . She did not see our plates . She was taking a rest . <p> The surf fishers headed for the bar with their check . <p> " Are those your friends ? " I said when they had gone . <p> It was cold walking down the strand from The Palms , back to the car , under the street-lamps painted black for the dimout , and to keep warm I took my arms out of my sleeves and folded them across my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sweater that way , my father said , annoyed at my posture . Or at something , someone  --  the surf fishers , maybe . <p> He drove slowly then , very carefully , and said nothing more until we were back in my neighborhood , on my street and parked before our house . <p> " I do n't think I 'll come in , though , " he said . " Your mother 's probably home by this time and  --  " The burglar alarm in the poultry shop at the corner rang briefly as the place was being shut up for the night . <p> " Well , it 's her home , " he said . " She 's probably relaxing and everything . After a hard day 's work and everything . Not looking forward to company or anything  --  some other time .

" <p> I returned my arms to my sweater sleeves , the damp of the beach gone . The light from the streetlamp , not painted over this far inland , filtering through the trees , made a pattern on the car , shadows shuddering in a slight breeze . " Where do you guess you 'll go in the war ? " I said . <p> " Well , they do n't tell you that . " I saw the hand of a drowning sailor sinking in the water , his stricken ship in the background .

" <p> He opened the glove compartment and studied his fuel gauge in the light it shed , though with the motor off this was pointless , was n't it ? " I really meant for you to keep that five dollars , " he said . I had returned it to him , his deposit , when the bill for dinner had come and he was short . " But I do n't want to take it back empty . " He shut the glove compartment . " That would n't be nice .

" <p> " I ca n't think of any problems , " I said . <p> " Well , I 'm glad you have n't got any problems . " In laughter he reached for my knee . I did n't move , but recoiled just the same . He withdrew his hand . <p> " Oh , hell , I know I 'm going to be all right , " he said . " I 'm not the least bit concerned about that part of it .

I could see my father in snapshots again , yellowed snapshots , dog-eared and chipped , in woolen trunks and a belt , leaning against the wall of the Ocean Arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his moustache tilting with his grin . I could see what my mother saw in him , but I could smell the cedar of her hope chest , too , and I knew it was all in the past . <p> " And tell me about your grades in school and everything , and all your friends . " <p> " You know , Conrad , what I wish you would do ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " I would take more interest in ball if I were you . " <p> " In ball ? " <p> " Sports . " <p> I was silent . <p> " I 'd let someone else take out the yellow flags . " <p> " I ca n't , " I said . <p> " Yes , you can , " he said . " If you make up your mind . " <p> " There 's no one else to take them out . " <p> " There is . That 's foolishness , Conrad . " <p> " The person who gets a hundred percent in fractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . Then I said , " You get to leave class early and come back late . " <p> " That 's fine , but  --  " <p> " So you got to have mastery in fractions . " <p> " Mastery ?

He was still sitting there in the borrowed car , a black silhouette , a lawn between us . I could not be sure if he was looking at me . I was in shadow too . He did n't wave , I did n't . <p> I went into the house and closed the door . <p>
