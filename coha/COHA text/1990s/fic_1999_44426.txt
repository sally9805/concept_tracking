Hullo , sweets . It 's me . No , everything 's not fine . Everything 's terrible . I just wanted to hear your voice . Yeah , an awful thing happened . Just when I thought it could n't get worse . Just let me be sad on you , honey , just for a while , please ? I have to say-I just want to disappear sometimes , you know ? I have to say it . Yes . I know you do n't like to hear that . I promise , I swear I do n't like to say it . No , I wo n't check out , baby , I could n't kill you that way , now , could I ? But I have to be able to be sad on you sometimes , or I 'll just blow up-and you 're the only one who- you just got ta let me , and then forget about it , that 's all . Do you believe I 've just drunk an entire bottle of wine ? Sauvignon Blanc . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol content . Remember how I taught you ? The tiny print that goes sideways up the label , highest number wins ? Thirteen-point-eight , this one . Pretty good deal for six bucks . My cheeks are hot . It was organic though , so the hangover wo n't be so bad . I promise . I 've tried this one out before . Do n't worry so much , kid ; I 'm safe in my little pad here . Got the guitar tape playing . That pretty little Catalan folk song . All scratchy ; the one in the discount collection . The one that sounds like it 's saying , and this is the way my story goes . I want to dance when that song comes on , honey . I want to take a deep curtsy , the way you might for a lover , or the queen of somewhere . Then I want to move in wide arcs , rich and gentle , Martha Graham , all balanced and symmetrical-no , I 'm not gon na drive anywhere , sweetheart , I promise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sis . <p> Yes , a man thing . A man-disaster . This time went worse than the time before . Oh , we had a second lunch , even though he 'd stood me up the one before . Why ? Because when he called to apologize he was so abject , that 's why . I could only melt , and say okay . You would 've too , I swear it . Anybody would 've . And then it really turned out to be heaven ; ah God it was sweet . Lots of wine-Orvieto : pretty name ? and we talked and talked . Lord , it went on for miles . I told my office it was going to be a long one ; they were fine with that . I should have taken the afternoon off and taken him home right then , is what I should have done . When it was time to go he had my coat over my shoulders before I knew what had happened . His hands so warm , and something more  --  well , like a tall Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his eyes . Ultramarine , I swear it . So pure , so clear ; color of-color of the water off the Marquesas , okay ? Or one of our very , very best cleary marbles-remember ? We put the marbles in shoebox houses ; cut the holes for doors and windows . Made families of them . And the clearies were the beautiful daughters , were n't they ? I think they were . Anyway , his eyes . Right through me . Right through my clothes . Right through my-of course I knew he was married ! But the way he was acting and talking , you would swear it was not-not an object . He said the most beautiful things , things I would never-I just do n't know anymore what that means , when people are married , you know ? I did n't know what to do . I do n't want to fuck up anybody 's life , I swear to you , swear to God-but I could use a little relief sometimes , you know ? Remember that quote out of Fiddler- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do n't think I do n't know how it looks ; your older sister grim as Eeyore , sad as a fucking basset hound , and you on your third husband with a houseful of kids . Yes . Yes , I had lovers the equivalent of husbands-yes , okay , four ; but people never-hey . Do you remember when we were driving back from Fiddler , and we were in Daddy 's old car , and the steering wheel came off in my hands ? Can you believe how we were screaming then , zooming down the freeway home , the steering wheel sitting there in my hands like somebody 's hamburger ? What did I do : tell me quick ; I ca n't remember . That 's right . I stuck it back on ! And it worked ! Craziness . Then when we got home and told Daddy , the way his poor face went slack ? I bet he wished he were making more than a teacher 's salary so he could buy us each brand new cars , each of us . Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . She probably wished we 'd been wiped out . No , I do n't mean that , I guess . But it was fine anyway , how it worked out , inheriting the little Volkswagen and all . Poor Daddy . God bless him , huh . Bless our papa . Jesus , I want to talk to him sometimes still so much it hurts . Fifty-three 's so fucking young . Fifty-three 's prime time . Guys run for president older than that . You too ? What do you want to ask him about ? Sex , right ? Of course sex , and labor unions , and-do you have dreams like mine , where he shows up and explains very calmly that he 's fine , but he can only visit a little while ? And then you go to hold him and he 's really real , and you can smell that wonderful man-smell against his chest , cherry pipe tobacco and man-sweat , and you cry and cry , and wake up crying ? Well , I 'm not surprised . I always knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for experimentation-how long , tell me , have I been telling you that ? <p> Know what I 'll never forget ? When you said you saw Daddy looking out from the baby 's face . It happened , right ? In the grocery store that day ? How the baby 's eyes held the light of his eyes , and it froze you ? There was Joey sitting in the baby-seat of the grocery cart , fat and gorgeous-such an equable little beach ball , that one-and all of a sudden the way he looked at you , and you knew it was Daddy looking at you from in there , clear as a bell . I 'll never forget it , what you told me . You said to him-out loud in the grocery store-looking into the baby 's face- I 'm doing the best I can with these kids , Daddy ; I really am . And you know it 's true , sweetheart . How can you resist thinking how proud he 'd be of those three little boys ? I think it all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . Might as well tell him , huh , darlin ' , whether he 's in there or not . <p> Yeah , the guy from the restaurant finally came over . He made me wait a long time , though . And just when I 'd be ready to give up , he 'd call again , to say he 'd be later . I was a wreck . I 'd zoomed home early that day and all , just to get ready for him . I took a long bath , and used the apple shampoo that smells so heavenly when your hair dries , and I had fresh fruit in the kitchen , flowers , wine , the whole bit . I even got rid of all the dusty old plants , and I put brand new ones all around . About time , huh . It really was pretty , honey , I promise the place never looked so nice ; you 'd have been amazed . But ho , was I nervous . Terrified . Heart attack . Could n't think . Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mind was making all that white noise , you know ? Na nah na na nah na na nah . Like the car ignition turning over and over and it wo n't catch , coughing and screeching and never catching . If I let myself think about being with him , my heart wanted to come out my chest , I promise you . <p> And then what ? Well , he finally called the last minute of the last hour , when I had started to feel kind of cold all over . I could n't stand itI was about to leave the apartment . For where ? Anywhere . I ca n't stand being a sitting duck like that . He 'd known I was waiting all that time for him , and my heart was really about to burst by that point , so when he called I screamed into the phone at him , that he was messing with my head . To my amazement , he yelled back ! Something about being scared of getting involved with me . This might sound nuts to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you know how it melts you when a man tells the truth that way-it was so brave , to say he was scared . Then after what felt like a hundred more hours he finally came up my stairs-what a queer feeling , seeing this lovely man , whom I 've only seen in restaurants and offices , finally coming up my landing . And I took him by the hand , and there it all was again : so warm . The whole business . Incredible voltage , still there . Very there . My mind began to roar , and we embraced , and I caught a glimpse of us in the mirror together-my head against his chest-and it seemed nice , you know ? The way we looked together . It seemed better than all right . Then he fled to the can , and I poured us some wine-I think I even had the presence of mind to unplug the phone . And it seemed , in spite of how scared he was , like everything was possible then . That 's all I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right . <p> We sat on the couch , and I put on the most beautiful guitar music I own . The Catalan song was on there . I lit candles , and then we were kissing , and off the couch and onto the floor , and I felt like the last woman on earth . He was saying and doing the most astonishing things . I knew he would be the most powerful and imaginative lover I might ever know . He had ideas . Ways he had imagined it . Different rooms of it . He gave me these teasing little tastes , with his words , and his movements . His kisses were like-swift attacks : very deep , lush-and then gone , before I could give back the same way . I can not tell you the things he said-no , sweetheart , I really ca n't ; not even you-except they were frighteningly hot , frighteningly beautiful . You just have to believe me . It was like standing at the edge of a thunderous falls , with the ozone spray wafting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not let me undress , and he would not let it go further than the kind of urgent pressing and groping we suffered in high school . He said : we both know it 's wrong for me to be here . He said : it could easily become an obsession . He said : I am conditioned to feel this guilt . Nothing I could say could persuade him . Not even the notion that it was all of a piece  --  the first kiss , all the words , making love . No , he was having none of it . And so we were locked in this I-will-but-he-ca n't marathon , a stalemate , insects caught in amber . There were long moments where I was stretched out on the floor looking up at him , adoring and ripe and ready as any woman on this earth , and there he was over me , looking and looking into my face , as if he were trying to crack a code . It was all in him-yet he was locked . Madness . Like nothing I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : I 'm going to leave now , and I want you to be all right with that . And when I turned my face away  --  thickness balling up in my throat-he said , give us a smile now . I was dumbfounded . Incredulous . I managed to speak , in the queerest flattest voice-I hardly knew it as my own : Why ? I said . And he said , because it 's such a beautiful smile . I thought , My God . Who the fuck do you think you are ? Somehow I formed words , and I spoke them : Why do you go so far , and no further ? Just to see what felt like ? And he turned his face away very fast , and while it was turned away , his voice got louder . Let me just see if I can get this right . He said : It 's not as simple as that . It 's about finding out that you can still feel that way for someone , and that someone can still feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not getting it quite right , but that was the essence of it . He looked away from me the whole time he spoke . And then I was sick . I 'd been a lab animal . I murmured : Well they can , and they do . And I got to my feet . Walked him downstairs . <p> One thing more-something I 'm ashamed to tell you . At the bottom of the stairwell , in the dark , I pulled off my silk top , and my bra . I had to place his hands on me , because you could not see your own hand in that dark . He seemed to be thunderstruck a moment , and then he kissed me and kind of bit me a little , everywhere , unbelievable sweetness , the way that makes your eyes roll back and lose sight , the way I was certain it would be-all this in pitch blackness , at the bottom of the stairwell  --  and he was saying again and again : you are exquisite . You are exquisite . <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark for my shirt , and my bra , and then clutching them , I walked back up the stairs , slowly . Naked to the waist , numb , no idea of anything . Listen to me . I knew at that moment he was taking long steps on the street , my street , through the night air , through the cold still air of my street , to his car . And I knew the coldness of the air was sweet to him . I knew he was breathing deep of it , immeasurably deep , and that his heart was calming fast . And I knew by the time he got home , that heart of his would be soothed and light and peaceful . He would fix himself a glass of something , go to bed with a book , sleep like a child . And next day he would be crisp and vivacious ; an extra lilt in his step . And what does that make me then  --  can you tell me that ? Can you ? I would just like you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceives you as a contagious disease . It is not a good thing to watch a man watching you as if you were a black hole making sucking noises . I am still a good woman , still a beautiful woman-are n't I ? No , it 's good for me to cry , sweetheart . It would be bad not to cry . <p> I know less and less . I swear it . I wish I were a dog . Then somebody just pets you . Pets you and pets you . And you do n't displace anything . You do n't knock the stuffing out of somebody 's holy equation . You do n't disrupt a goddamned teacup . <p> Yes , I should come see the kids . Let me tell you something . If I let myself , when I just think of their faces , I go crazy . I ca n't stand it . I ca n't stand the idea that those faces will sooner or later have to see all this . Worse . They 'll have to become this at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Already they 're cutting deals-Lord , they 're cutting the deals so early now . But when the sex gets mixed up in it , it 's finished , over . It 's all wrong , and it stays wrong forever . <p> What ? What 's he doing ? Putting a piece of cookie in his ear ? No , I 'll wait . Go ahead and tend him . Sweet pea-every day , he does that ? Yes , I know very well what it 's making you remember . No , I do ; I really do . The years in Honolulu , when you came to visit , right ? You brought the oldest over when he was brand new , and we thought he was the Son of God because he was your first . Where were we : the grocery store again , was n't it . Seems like everything happens to us there . And how did it go-we had a plumeria we 'd picked . That 's right . Those lovely flowers like oversized jasmine , pink staining white , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the swings . And the mountains of Oahu all bluegreen around us , with those piles of silver clouds like whipping cream , scudding by so fast in the ocean wind , and Mama and Auntie pushing Max on the swing , in our swimsuits . And then the plumeria flower we were carrying disappeared while we were cruising through the store , and all of sudden we noticed it was gone , and both our hearts just stopped right then with fear . And there was little Max riding along in his grocery cart baby seat , so mild and equable , staring at us . And you were staring back at him-and then it came to you . Because you 're the Mama . Somehow , suddenly , you figured it out-calm and cool you were , even though he was the Son of God . And you got the tweezers out of my purse , and gently , gently grasped up with them inside his little baby nostril . <p> And out came the plumeria , pink-on-white , perfectly preserved , petals blooming open in flower-ballet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Max 's amazement- his stone-pure amazement , at the emerging flower-and at how we were laughing , honey . How he looked at us , blinked a moment , and then how he grinned , delighted to have authored such a mighty fine trick . And the way we were laughing so hard by then , tears streaming down , both of us staggering and gasping against the cart , falling down laughing onto the cool linoleum of the grocery store , the baby blinking and grinning at both of us like he was accepting an Academy Award . <p> All of a sudden I 'm so tired , sweetheart . Maybe I can finally sleep a little . That 's something , is n't it , to be able to sleep again . Yes , I guess I 'll drive up soon . I miss the kids , I really do . Sure , I promise I 'll come . It 's good to have a plan , is n't it . It 's good to have a plan . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
