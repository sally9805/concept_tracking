All places where the French settled early have corruption at their heart , a kind of soft , rotten glow , like the phosphorescence of decaying wood , that is oddly attractive . Seductive , even , if my mother-in-law , whose astonishing opinion that was , was to be believed . And she was always believed . The conventional wisdom of her day was that Hannah Stuart Chambliss would rather be burnt at the stake than tell a lie . I do n't find that surprising at all . I think the Maid of Orleans role would have pleased Mother Hannah to a fare-thee-well , even the fiery martyr 's death . Mother H had a streak of thespian in her as wide as her savage stratum of truth , and she employed it just as fiercely when the need arose . I never knew anyone who escaped those twin lashes except my husband , Peter . He alone might have profited from them . She told me that , about the corruption and the seduction , on the evening I came to Retreat colony for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since she first met me , the year before , when Peter took me to the big house in Boston to meet her and his father , but she had never voiced it until then . But it was plain to me -- and , I suppose , to Peter -- that it , or something like it , lay like an iceberg beneath her austere and beautiful surface . Oh , she smiled her carved Etruscan smile , all the years of our relationship , and hugged me lightly and kissed my cheek with lips like arctic butterflies , but none of us were fooled . I do n't think she meant us to be . My unsuitability hung in the pristine air of the Chambliss drawing room like a body odor . But it was not until Peter brought me as a bride to theold brown cottage on Penobscot Bay , in northern Maine , where the Chamblisses had summered for generations , that she allowed that particular little clot of displeasure to pass , and with it damned me and Charleston , and , indeed the entire indolent , depraved South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a little hug of my shoulders and a small laugh , in response to something old Mrs. Stallings bellowed in her ginny bray , did nothing to mitigate its sting . Augusta Stallings looked at me , small and roundly curved and black-eyed and - haired and brown with sun , standing in the chilly camphor dusk of the cottage 's living room , and fell upon my utter alienness , in that place of fair straight hair and rain-colored eyes and long bones and teeth and oval New England faces , like a trout on a mayfly . " Charleston , you say ? " she shouted . " Gascoigne , from Charleston ? I know some Pinckneys and a Huger , but I never met any Gascoignes . French , is it ? Or Creole , I expect . Well , you 're a colorful little thing , no doubt about that . You 'll open some eyes at the dining hall , my girl . " And that is when my mother-in-law laid her long Stuart arm around my shoulders and made her light little speech about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker , but I doubt that anyone noticed . The cottage 's living room was as dark as a cave because Hannah would rarely allow the huge lilac trees that obscured its windows to be cut . It was the first thing I did after she died . Peter pulled me close , grinning first at his mother and then at Augusta Stallings . " The only French who settled in Charleston were four hundred good gray Huguenots on the run after Louis the Fourteenth revoked the Edict of Nantes , " he said . " Not a jot or tittle of corruption in the lot of them . Or seductiveness either , I imagine . Unless , of course , you meant that Maude was an octoroon , Mama ? " " Do n't be silly , Peter , " Hannah said , in a tone that said she had indeed entertained the possibility . There was my dark skin , after all , and the black eyes , and the hair that curled in tight ringlets around my head . And something about the nose .... " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely at me in the cold , pearly dusk . The tumbler of neat gin that she held sloshed onto the sisal rug .
