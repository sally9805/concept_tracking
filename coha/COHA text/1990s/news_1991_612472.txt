<p> Move over , Batman , and make room for the brothers . <p> With hip-hopping heroics and enough cultural savvy to shake up Superman , a handful of independent comic books by African-American artists and writers have materialized on the national comic book scene - a $ 400 million-a-year industry long dominated by white creators , characters and companies . <p> This new breed of black comic book creators has already drawn comparisons to such young African-American filmmakers as Spike Lee and John Singleton - artists with their own style and vision . <p> Shooooommmmm ! <p> That 's the sound made by Black Thunder , a masked avenger blessed with super speed and a serious dislike for criminals , especially slimy drug dealers . <p> Thunder is the brainchild of Ernest Gibbs Jr. , 26 , a Charlotte , N.C. , native and lifelong comic book addict . <p> " This is part love affair , part social reaction , " explains Mr. Gibbs , manager of a Foot Locker store in Charlotte by day and founder of Breeze Comics . " I 've always loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own comic book conventions . <p> " It just bothered me that there were so few black superheroes , " he says . " And most of them were nothing more than sidekicks . So I figured it was time to do something about it . " <p> With about $ 3,000 in personal savings and loans from family members , Mr. Gibbs started Black Thunder ( probably the only hero ever based in Charlotte ) . " He 's what I would be if I were a superhero , " says Mr. Gibbs , who handles writing chores on the book . " He 's definitely a homeboy from the ' hood . " <p> And getting more popular . <p> Diamond and Capital City , the two largest comic book distributors in the country , now market the book . So far , more than 1,500 copies of the $ 2.50 first issue have been sold , with requests for reprints still coming in . An independent comic book usually can survive by selling several thousand copies a month , trade officials say . A much-anticipated second issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 3 , Mr. Gibbs plans to introduce a black superheroine .

After 1960 , a wave of more realistic characters and superheroes , such as Marvel 's Black Panther , emerged . <p> Today , the comic book industry is known for its acceptance of multi- ethnic talent , says Don Thompson , co-editor of The Comics Buyer 's Guide , a well-respected weekly trade journal .

Marvel also plans to bring back Luke Cage , an imposing , nearly invulnerable black champion from the 1970s . And DC has plans to revive Black Lightning , first introduced in 1977 . <p> The handful of mainstream comic books featuring black lead characters has never done exceptionally well . One main reason , some industry observers say , could be the profile of the average comic book reader in America : White men 18 and older. ; Brotherman ' takes the lead <p> Then there 's the matter of economics and competition . <p> Generally , independent publishers face an uphill battle when it comes to securing distribution deals and initial production costs . They also face formidable foes in Marvel , DC and a growing list of established independents . <p> " I 'm not surprised about this new wave of black independents , " Mr. Benton says .

" The quality and enthusiasm is definitely there . " <p> Arguably the most successful and popular newcomer is Brotherman , " Dictator of Discipline , " as he is dubbed . <p> Cleverly written and illustrated in the outlandish , black-and-white style popularized by Mad magazine , Brotherman is the creation of three real-life brothers Jason ( production ) , David ( artwork ) , and Guy ( writer ) Sims . <p> Published by their Big City Comics in Irving , Texas , Brotherman chronicles the satirical adventures of Antonio Valor , an assistant district attorney in Big City and streetwise champion of justice . <p> So far , the Sims siblings have produced four issues of Brotherman ( about 10,000 copies a printing ) , along with posters , T-shirts and postcards .

But I guess that 's a good problem to have . " <p> It 's a problem that Kamal Shariff of Cambridge , Mass. , hopes to encounter. ; Comics popular in Atlanta <p> Steeped in an Afrocentric culture and space-age heroics , his Numidian Force follows the exploits of six multicultural characters - Karnak , Yin Yang , Dreadlock , SeeBa , TaMerit and Master Sage . Along with fighting evil , they take time to reflect on such issues as the environment , racial pride and global peace . <p> Mr. Shariff , who has relatives in Atlanta , will be in town this week promoting his comic book on local radio and TV shows . <p> " Initially , I wanted to produce toys , " admits Mr. Shariff , 33 , who spent 10 years as a financial consultant with a Fortune 500 company before launching Kamite Comics &; Entertainment .

" <p> Aside from its interstellar escapades ( priced at $ 2 an issue ) , Numidian Force emphasizes positive images and comes with its own glossary . Already , several elementary schools and church groups around Boston have ordered copies . <p> " The potential here is enormous , " Mr. Shariff says . " I believe it does wonders for ethnic children to see ethnic superheroes . " <p> Locally , Black Thunder , Numidian Force and Brotherman have sold extremely well , with local retailers and fans eagerly awaiting subsequent issues . <p> " Our main problem is we ca n't get enough copies , " says Rick Hull , a clerk at Oxford Comics in Buckhead . " As soon as they come in , they 're gone .
