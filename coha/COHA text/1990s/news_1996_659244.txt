<p> With a sharpshooter to protect them from snakes and alligators , divers searched the Everglades muck today for critical data recorders and found pitifully disintegrated remains of victims of ValuJet Flight 592 . <p> But exactly how to remove the wreckage from the swamp remained as uncertain as the cause of the smoke that filled the cockpit and cabin before Saturday 's crash , which killed all 109 aboard . <p> " This is tough stuff out there , " National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Robert Francis said today . <p> Some 30 police divers were taking part in the search , dressed in special gear and with a marksman accompanying them , he said . <p> Federal regulators today began an intensive review of ValuJet 's practices , stepping up safety efforts that had been under way since earlier this year . The price of stock in the 3-year-old airline was down sharply . <p> President Clinton said today he has directed Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to report to him this week on additional measures the government can do to ensure that U.S. airlines " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm determined to do everything I can to make sure American aviation is the safest in the world , " he said . He also expressed condolences to the victims ' families . <p> In separate briefings today , the county Medical Examiner 's Office and the NTSB both stressed the difficulties of their task . <p> The NTSB 's Francis said the 30 or so police divers " are having to dress up ahead of time in biohazard equipment , gloves , taping everything on , then putting on large rubber suits on top of that ( and ) masks . " Then , after 20 minutes in the water , they return to be decontaminated , he said . <p> " So it 's not the most efficient of operations , and for these folks , it 's tough going , " he said . <p> The medical examiner 's office said recovery workers had filled three body bags with human remains , the largest part so far a knee . <p> " I do n't hold any hope we 'll find any recoverable large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Davis told reporters . Davis , who is helping with the investigation , said it could take up to a week to identify victims and that some might never be identified . <p> Some family member have asked to visit the crash site but no decision had been made late this morning . Frustrations were mounting . <p> " They should have had a crane or a radar or something . They 've got that kind of equipment , " said Raquel Perry , daughter-in-law of crash victim Wilhemina Perry of Miami . <p> " By the time they get out there with those alligators and stuff , she 'll be all ate up , " she said . <p> The grim task proceeded in an eerie , surreal atmosphere , as the vast Everglades seemed to have swallowed the plane . Even at the spot where the aircraft pierced the water , divers literally groped for clues . <p> " They 're down to less than an inch as far as underwater visibility . A lot of it is being done by feel , " said NTSB investigator Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 feet of water but remained at the site for the time being . NTSB officials said a fragment 8 feet long was the largest they had seen . <p> Francis said much of the wreckage found so far is painted blue , which is the color ValuJet paints the rear of its planes . The rear is where the flight data and cockpit voice recorders are located . <p> The water ranged from 6 inches to 5 feet deep . Beneath that was muck that some locals say can be 30 to 40 feet deep . <p> Senior NTSB investigators with hundreds of crash investigations behind them called the site , far from roads and accessible only by airboats , " the most difficult scene that they have ever encountered , " Francis said . <p> Mosquitoes and heat in the mid-80s also plagued recovery workers , prompting Howard and Gloria Sexton to launch a small relief effort Sunday . The couple drove from their home in Boca Raton with a van load of donated insect repellent , bottled water and candy bars for the workers . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else , " Howard Sexton explained . <p> The swamp yielded pieces of clothing Sunday , in addition to a family photo album and a floating airplane seat that were found Saturday . <p> Clearer pictures of the passengers also emerged Sunday : a Baptist church organist and his wife on a dream vacation , a young man preparing for missionary work in his native Venezuela , a mother and her daughter who had become " real friends " in recent years . <p> Also among the victims were San Diego Chargers running back Rodney Culver and his wife , Karen , of Woodstock , Ga . <p> Flight 592 took off Saturday afternoon en route to Atlanta but the crew soon reported smoke in the cockpit and cabin and asked to turn back . The tape of the conversation with the air traffic controller showed that the pilot felt " a considerable sense of urgency , " Francis said . The plane crashed about 15 miles northwest of Miami International Airport . <p> The source of the cockpit smoke was unknown . <p> Roger Kubeck , whose wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks the crew was unconscious by the time the plane plunged into the swamp . <p> " I think they passed out from the smoke , based on that eyewitness report that the angle never varied . If that 's correct , they were obviously incapacitated , " he told The Associated Press today . Himself a pilot , he said he wanted to know whether the plane had modern smoke masks or older goggles that might have trapped the smoke inside . <p> Feith said there was no way to speculate about whether the pilots were unconscious when the plane crashed . After a crew member acknowledged receiving information on the closest airport , the Miami tower tried twice more to contact the plane but received no response , he said . <p> Possible causes of the smoke include an electrical short circuit , an overheated tire on the nose wheel that retracts under the cockpit , or engine problems because air bled from the engines is used to pressurize the cabin , said aviation consultant David Stempler . He emphasized he was not speculating about causes in the ValuJet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the crash , ValuJet stock tumbled more than 34 percent early today , then recovered some of the lost ground . In early afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market , ValuJet was down 23 percent , or by $ 4.12 at $ 13.75 a share . <p> The Atlanta-based discount airline had had at least three accidents since it began operations in 1993 . The most serious before now was a runway fire last year that destroyed a plane and burned a flight attendant . <p> Federal Aviation Administration records showed the crashed jet had returned to airports seven times over the past two years because of various maintenance problems , from an oil leak to loss of cabin pressure . But it had been inspected just four days before the crash . <p> The FAA began a special investigation of the airline in February . FAA inspectors will ride in ValuJet cockpits over the next 30 days as part of stepped-up checks in the wake of the crash . <p> " If ValuJet had any reason to believe one of our airliners was unsafe , we would voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pena and FAA Chairman David Hinson visited the crash site Sunday . At a news conference , Pena expressed confidence in the airline . <p> Victims ' loved ones struggled for words to convey their loss . <p> " There 's no evidence of the plane . It 's gone , " said a stunned Bret Rugg , 41 , of Richmond , Ind. , whose wife , Terri , was on the plane . He had taken his two sons , ages 5 and 11 , to meet their mother on her return from a cruise she made as a travel agency owner . <p> " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " he said .
