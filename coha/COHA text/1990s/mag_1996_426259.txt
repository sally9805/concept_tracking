If General Motors were split into four parts , its shares might be worth half again as much . The risk : Falling back on its core business of making cars and trucks would leave it permanently stranded in Headnote the slow lane . // THERE IT SITS in its accustomed position atop the FORTUNE 500 : General Motors , by a wide margin the largest corporation in the U.S. Last year its sales reached $168.8 billion and its profits $6.9 billion-both records for GM or any other American corporation . If those numbers are hard to get your mind around , think about this : GM built 8.6 million cars and trucks in 1995 . If they were lined up on the equator bumper to bumper , they would stretch all the way around the world , a lane of traffic 25,000 miles long . Now peer again at those sales and profits figures . You 're looking at the past . GM will not post numbers even close to those in 1996 , nor most likely will it ever do so again . The U.S. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing so slowly , quietly , and somewhat tentatively , the automaker seems headed down a road at the end of which it will eventually have broken itself into as many as four parts , outdoing that other immense icon , AT &T,; which is slicing itself only into three ( see " AT &T:; Ready to Run , Nowhere to Hide " ) . GM 's computer business , Electronic Data Systems , is already being sent to the chop shop , and Hughes Electronics , the satellite and defense company , appears to be headed there-so does a batch of old-line parts operations clumped together in GM 's Delphi subsidiary . Photograph Those who have set the scene for the breakup are ( from left ) CEO Jack Smith ; outside director and former chairman John Smale , who led a coup against the old regime ; and vice chairman Harry Pearce , who is likely to succeed Smith as chief executive . Photograph Those who have set the scene for the breakup are ( from left ) CEO Jack Smith ; outside director and former chairman John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and vice chairman Harry Pearce , who is likely to succeed Smith as chief executive . // A first glance suggests shareholders ought to be cheering GM on-and urging it to move down that breakup road faster . Reason : The sum of the company 's basically healthy parts is considerably greater than its swollen and plodding whole . As four pieces , GM would likely boast a total market value 45% larger than what it claims today . Certainly long-term stockholders have not had much to shout hurrah about . Since the glory days of the 1950s and 1960s , the company has been spending lots and making little . Return on assets-a measure of how efficiently it uses capital-skidded downward , from about 17% in 1965 to below zero a few years ago , before nudging up to 3.2% last year . Adjusted for splits , the stock price has increased by only 161% over the past 35 years , while Standard &; Poor 's list of 500 major companies has ballooned 900% . Among the 113 companies that have appeared on the FORTUNE 500 every year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total return to shareholders is among the lowest in that group . But what is good for shareholders today may not be good for the long-term health of GM itself . The fundamental problem with the creeping divestiture strategy that GM seems to be pursuing is that there is no zesty , glamorous core waiting to be exposed . GM would remain mired in the slow-growing car and truck business-with no fast-growing high-tech components to help it steer smoothly through the inevitable cyclical downturns . While these afflict all businesses , they are especially cruel to automakers . When , and if , GM is broken into a quartet , it will be largely due to the cumulative efforts of the three gents pictured at the beginning of this article . John Smale , 68 , the former CEO of Procter &; Gamble , led the boardroom mutiny that toppled GM 's old management in 1992 and stayed on as chairman . During Smale 's tenure , GM 's credibility in the marketplace improved ( the stock is up about 60% since the rebellion ) and so did its credit rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and stepped down as chairman , although he remains on the board . " I went into a set of circumstances that clearly does n't exist anymore , " he told FORTUNE in a rare interview . " So it seemed like the right thing to do and the right time to do it . " That leaves CEO Jack Smith clearly in command . Smith does n't say outright that he is eager to make GM a smaller company , but his words suggest that , in retrospect , maybe it was n't such a good idea for the company to swallow EDS and Hughes a decade ago . He puts the matter politely . " We had a couple of great acquisitions , " he says . " But what we needed to do-and we were late getting going on it-was fix our core business . And that has been our focus over the last four years . " At 58 , Smith looks tired , and associates suggest he will retire when he reaches 62 . The past four years have been brutal . Recently Smith offhandedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adding , " I 'm not looking forward to that . " Quitting while he is ahead would be in character . Smith does n't appear to need , or even get a lift from , the power or the perks that come with being in charge . Photograph The Oldsmobile Intrigue , due out next year , should help GM hold on to its U.S. market share . // Harry Pearce , 53 , recently named vice chairman , is Smith 's likely successor , and a surprising heir apparent at that . Eleven years ago he was a trial lawyer in Bismarck , North Dakota , who left his practice to join GM as associate general counsel and has since made his way to the top as old-line engineers detoured into retirement . Pearce is GM 's tough cop and looks the part , not given to mistyeyed sentimentality over things like , well , cars . " If I had a spare billion dollars in cash , would I put it into the auto business ? " he asks . " I doubt it . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the more painful details of breaking up GM . The easiest phase is just about over . GM is in the final stages of spinning off EDS , the company that Ross Perot founded and GM bought for $2.5 billion 12 years ago . EDS was supposed to expose GM to high-tech thinking and at the same time create a single , unified computer system for the entire company . Not only did Perot battle with the GM board , but the two cultures also clashed throughout the organization , so the integration never knit together very well . Serving outsiders , however , EDS has been a tremendous success , creating complex information systems for such customers as RollsRoyce , Xerox , and the Inland Revenue ( Britain 's IRS ) . EDS had earnings of $939 million last year on revenues of $12.4 billion . In disposing of the computer company , GM has turned over its EDS shares to the independent GM pension fund . Based on the price of the 69% of EDS shares that are publicly traded , that gift is currently worth about $8.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in part , a $500 million sum that EDS will pay GM for its freedom . Also , a staggering burden will be lifted from GM : The company will have met its obligations and be current in financing the present and future retirement of hundreds of thousands of employees . Hughes Electronics is likely to be the next chunk of GM to be liberated . GM bought Hughes for $5.2 billion a year after it purchased EDS . The auto company wanted the advanced electronic expertise that it thought could help it make safer , better cars . That venture , too , has been somewhat disappointing . Hughes has indeed developed some devices for autos , such as an inexpensive radar that within a few years might be fitted into bumpers to warn drivers of impending collisions . But in general the technology-transfer benefits have been scarce . " There are no synergies and no economic value to GM and Hughes being locked together , " says analyst David Bradley , who watches GM for J.P . Morgan Securities . Like EDS , Hughes has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion last year produced earnings of $1.1 billion , largely from the sale of communications satellites to China , Japan , and others ; it also makes cruise missiles and other weapons systems for the Pentagon . GM has sold to the public 96 million shares of Hughes-technically not common stock but shares that have a claim on 24% of Hughes 's earnings . Based on a recent trading price of about $60 for those shares , GM 's 76% stake in Hughes is worth more than $19 billion . That 's equal to almost half the market value of all of GM in its present form . Before selling Hughes , GM would probably detach and hold on to the Delco division , which used to be part of GM itself and continues to make auto electronics , such as controls for antilock brakes and airbags . But will GM divest Hughes ? For the record , CEO Smith is noncommittal . But at the end of March , GM filed a document with the SEC that would allow it to sell or spin off Hughes if it so chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hughes was going its own way . The official name used to be General Motors Hughes Electronics . Then the first two words were lopped off . C. Michael Armstrong , Hughes 's CEO , has been on the road touting the company 's prospects . Early this year Hughes took another step toward establishing a separate market value for itself . It sold to AT &T; a stake in DirecTV , a system that sends TV signals via satellite to viewers who buy a receiving dish about the size of a garbage-can lid and fasten it to the sides of their houses . AT &T; paid $137 million for just 2.5% of DirecTV , which implies the phone company thinks that enterprise alone is worth $5.5 billion . The third parting-likely to be the trickiest-would involve hiving off Delphi , which makes brakes , lights , transmissions , and hundreds of other auto parts . Unlike EDS and Hughes , Delphi has been an integral part of GM since the behemoth was formed nearly 90 years ago . But until last year it was known only as GM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business has been pulling away from its corporate parent . A quarter of its 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion came from Ford , Honda , Toyota , and other GM competitors . Detached from GM , Delphi would probably sell even more to those customers . Presumably , Ford and the rest would feel more comfortable buying from a supplier that was not providing cash flow to their biggest rival . Jack Kirnan , an analyst at Salomon Bros. , calculates that as a stand-alone , Delphi would have a market value of $6 billion . GM would like to get rid of Delphi for another reason . Its products are pricey , reflecting the high wages and fringe benefits-$44 an hour on average-paid to members of the United Automobile Workers . GM would like to be able to shop more freely in non-union precincts . And that 's just the reason Delphi will be so hard to dispose of . The UAW will almost certainly resist , because such a move would take work away from its members . Buying from non-union shops has been the major battleground on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reason the union struck two Delphi plants in Dayton earlier this year and shut down GM 's entire domestic assembly system . // GM 'S ASSETS HAVE GROWN STEADILY // BUT IT HAS N'T MADE MUCH MONEY WITH THEM // AND ITS SHARES HAVE GONE NOWHERE // If Delphi could be spun off to GM shareholders , a slew of retirees and their health and pension benefits might go with it . GM would be free to shop the world for components instead of having to buy in-house . Smith maintains that the UAW 's approval would not be needed , because the ownership would n't change . Good luck . By GM 's reading of the labor contract , UAW members had no right to strike in Dayton either , but that did n't stop them-an act that has vice chairman Pearce smoldering still . " I do n't think strikes should be allowed when you have a three-year contract and both sides are in compliance , " he says . This summer GM will start to negotiate a new three-year contract with the UAW . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making its muscle-bound adversary look weak and helpless . Pearce sounds less conciliatory toward the union than some other executives . What would remain of the core GM , should Hughes and Delphi be peeled away along with EDS , is basically this : a company that designs cars and trucks , manufactures their power trains and frames , assembles them with parts bought from suppliers , and markets those vehicles around the world . That 's a straightforward assignment-and for the faint-hearted , a terrifying one . The auto industry is mature , capital-intensive , highly cyclical , and chronically afflicted by worldwide overcapacity and fierce competition . Some of GM 's rivals-in France , Italy , Korea , and Japan-are shored up and protected by national industrial policies . On top of all that , demand for vehicles in GM 's prime market-North America , where its share is holding steady at about 33%-has barely grown in the past ten years . Nor is it likely to surge . With more than one car for every licensed driver , the U.S. seems sated for the time being . Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a nasty , tough business . How would a trimmer GM fare in that dogfight ? Probably no worse than now , and arguably better . Without obligations to buy expensive components from Delphi , it would be able to cut costs . Nor is there any reason to believe a slimmer GM would backslide on its recent progress in a host of key areas . One is design : The current fleet of GM cars is a big improvement over their counterparts of a few years back . True , few excite the senses the way that a 1955 Chevy or a 1964 Pontiac GTO used to . But driving an Oldsmobile is no longer a sign of terminal dullness , and owning a $10,885 Saturn sedan might even make you look smart . Under G. Richard Wagoner the financial performance of GM 's North American operations has also improved substantially . From the disastrous loss of $8.2 billion in 1991 , the U.S. business has steadily progressed to where , last year , it reported profits of $2.4 billion . Systematically , every plant and every car line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts in March that the new Chevrolet Lumina sedan requires 23% fewer hours to build than its predecessor , has 29% better quality , and costs 26% less to produce . Wagoner , 43 , had to sweat through some of GM 's factory makeovers . When GM switched to Toyota-style lean production , it did n't leave enough slack in the inventory and could n't get the assembly line restarted quickly after it was stopped for adjustments . Executives say they have ironed out the problems , and they 'd better be right . This year GM is revamping eight assembly plants , representing nearly 20% of its production . Among the models to be produced are a new minivan that will be sold in both the U.S. and Europe , and three new midsize cars . // Wall Street does n't put much stock in cars // After a series of disasters that included the beached-whale Chevrolet Caprice and the baroque Buick Skylark , GM has completed the overhaul of its product-development system . Key change : installing accountability by creating all-powerful managers known as vehicle line executives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : taking advantage of size by using the same basic set of components for a variety of models . Compact cars like the Chevy Cavalier , Saturn sedan , and Europe 's Opel Astra , which all used to be based on individual components , will soon be all but identical mechanically . Sometimes GM seems to collapse under its own weight . Economies of scale are supposed to rule the auto business , but GM sold 3.1 million passenger cars in the U.S. last year and lost money on them . Compact and subcompact cars are the villains because profits are inherently skimpy and the federal government requires that a certain number be sold to meet corporate average fuel economy standards . " We lose a lot of money in small cars , " says Wagoner . " This does n't make us unique , but it is a problem . " All North America 's profits come from trucks-pickups and sport-utility vehicles-and parts . As GM completes its factory overhaul and becomes fully competitive , Wagoner believes GM will get a chance to grow , not just cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like three-door pickups . Trucks account for 46% of industry sales but only 41% of GM 's production . He also wants to move more of GM 's vast technological capabilities into the market . GM is renowned for letting experimental programs languish in the lab . But this year it is rolling out an innovative safety system for Cadillac that merges cellular telephone technology with a groundpositioning satellite navigation system . Wagoner is getting a big assist from marketing czar Ron Zarrella , who was recruited from Bausch &; Lomb at the end of 1994 to instill a sense of common purpose along with some common sense . Through a combination of brains , guile , and muscle , Zarrella , 46 , has persuaded GM 's warring marketing divisions to cooperate for a change . Result : less duplication of effort . " Things have gone well above expectations , " he says , with understatement . Zarrella is too smart to say so , but much of what he 's done has n't been brain surgery . GM spends $1.5 billion a year on advertising , yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it does . GM formerly spent billions of dollars on rebates and cash-back offers that hurt its image and decimated profits . Now it is dialing back on incentives and spending more on TV and print to improve brand value , though Zarrella admits , " We need to start delivering great advertising . " GM has not managed its human capital very well , either . So Pearce is developing ambitious plans to help GM grow by " unlocking the value " of its employees . That may sound like consultantese , but it passes for brain surgery in the auto industry , where job descriptions are narrow and tightly focused . Says Pearce : " I do n't think we 've adequately thought out-of-the-box . The notion that the next-generation automobile can be just incrementally better-I do n't accept that . " Photograph The union shut GM down this winter and would likely fight the spinoff of the parts business . // In any discussion of the growth potential in cars and trucks , the conversation begins and ends overseas . International operations already account for about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contributed about 40% of its automotive profit . Within ten years 50% of GM 's vehicles may be sold outside North America , vs. 20% ten years ago . GM is the market-share leader in Western Europe with its Opel and Vauxhall brands , and it is expanding in Eastern Europe , where it recently announced plans for a $340 million plant in Poland . GM is also the leading car and truck producer in South America , and plans a new manufacturing and assembly complex in Argentina . But as GM 's well-traveled international boss , Louis Hughes , points out : " The growth is in Asia . " GM expects sales in the Asia Pacific region to grow , in round numbers , from 13 million vehicles last year to 20 million in a decade . Besides joint ventures in China and India , GM is trying to develop a major production center in either Thailand or the Philippines that would be fed by components operations in Australia , China , Korea , and Japan . Hughes thinks he can grab 10% of the region 's vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Believers in the back-to-basics strategy hail the prospect of faster sales abroad , buttressed by continued productivity improvements at home , as proof that concentrating on cars is the surest way for GM to thrive and deliver a payoff to shareholders . Director Smale goes so far as to insist that , " the only way we are going to increase shareholder value is if we do a better job of what the Lord put us on earth to do-make better cars and trucks . " But is it ? No one questions the need for GM to keep improving its car business . And for that reason it makes sense for the company to find a way to get rid of Delphi . What is n't clear is how , even with the best possible showing on the auto front , GM can get around this basic fact of life : A company dedicated to cars and trucks alone-unlike , say , an AT &T; focused on the exploding global communications business-is condemning itself to harvesting a field with fairly dismal growth prospects . So why not hang on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain prices-in the red-hot , high-tech sector ? It is not too late to pull back EDS , and GM should keep its grip on Hughes . That argument is no less compelling if you believe , as Smale insists he does , that any large capitalist enterprise must also think about higher goals than merely serving stockholders . " A corporation is a human , living enterprise , " he asserts . " It 's not just a bunch of assets . The obligation of management is to perpetuate the corporation , and that precedes their obligation to shareholders . " Here again , GM 's chances of perpetuating itself would seem to look a whole lot better if among the engines and transmissions it builds , there remained some computers and satellites too .
