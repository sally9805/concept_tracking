Contents* * * # The ocean ran through his dreams . The panting breath of the wavelets as they rose and fell against the pylons became his own breath , a slow , deep rhythm in his lungs that forced him to run . His footfalls reverberated against the black plastic photovoltaic field that doubled as a deck : a square track five kilometers long , encompassing the perimeter of the shark pen . Starlight glinted off the water ; glistened in the film of sweat that coated his pumping arms . The rubber soles of his running shoes beat out an ancient cursorial rhythm , a telling vibration transmitted through the deck to the perforated steel walls of the shark pen and then to the coral foundations of the station some twelve fathoms below . Crippled Tiburon would be lurking there near the bottom , listening , measuring the vibrations in his ancient , clever mind , waiting for the hour when his fins had fully regrown and his strength was at once new ... and old . <p> A thin wail twisted through the humid night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful tail . The wail grew into a distant howl of terror . <p> A faint splash . <p> Zayder sat up abruptly . The dream peeled away like burned film , leaving him in another version of the night . He 'd fallen asleep on a lounge chair again , in the open air , on the deck of the Ocean Hazards Collection Station that he managed alone . The blocky silhouette of the shed rose behind him . The structure seemed to be an ugly afterthought to the automated design of the U.N . mandated OHC Station . Still , it served him for housing , and storage for the shark farm : luxury quarters compared to the fishing boats he 'd grown up on . <p> Out on the water , the distant lights of a freighter interrupted the blanket of starlight . In the pen , the swish and splash of a shark fin accented the peaceful wash of the ocean . <p> Zayder leaned forward , ignoring the dry moss of a hangover that clung to his tongue and the roof of his mouth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dream . His pulse still hammered in his ears . He 'd heard howls like that before : once as a kid , when a man fell off the shark boats in the Sulu Sea . And again , one night when Mr. Ryan came to the station . Zayder had only reigned drinking the cordial that should have sent him into a drugged sleep . That night he 'd watched surreptitiously as a bound man went screaming to the sharks . <p> He listened . He thought he could detect a distant , angry voice from the direction of the freighter , but that was all . And what if he heard more ? What was he supposed to do if he discovered mayhem and murder on the high seas ? Call Mr. Ryan and complain about the neighbors ? He chose to believe that it had been a dream . <p> Dawn came . Zayder woke , washed his face , put on his running shoes . Another day . He would spend the morning doing maintenance on the robotic garbage trawlers that had come into the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the afternoon he would mutilate sharks , harvesting the regrown fins of the captive beasts for sale on the Chinese market  --  the prized ingredient in shark fin soup . So much to look forward to . <p> But first he would run . <p> He set off at an easy pace on the only route the station offered : a 5K lap around the photovoltaic decking built atop the steel mesh wall of the shark pen . At high tide the deck was a meter above the water , with the open sea on one side and the enclosed waters of the pen on the other . <p> Zayder had run this makeshift track twice every morning for almost a year . Boredom had been left behind long ago . Now , his mind automatically faded into a passive altered state before he finished the first hundred meters . Conversations rose from his past to fill his consciousness , insignificant exchanges : a joke offered to college acquaintances in a bar ; polite questioning of a professor ; a cautious response to the inquiries of a government personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and yet another personnel officer , hiring for the marine sanctuary in the Gulf of California , and another and another , until they all seemed to be different versions of the same bad news : I 'm sorry . You have an excellent record and your thesis is impressive , but I 'm afraid you 're not quite right for us .... <p> He studied every word , searching for some point where  --  if only he 'd phrased things differently  --  events would have taken a more positive path . An absurd exercise . He already knew the point when his career in marine biology had been lost . It had happened even before he knew what a career was , when he 'd been arrested at seventeen for poaching . <p> It had meant nothing to him at the time . He 'd been working for his dad , hunting pelagic sharks for a dealer , who preserved the bodies and sold them as dramatic ornaments for coastal mansions . Zayder 's family had been deep water fishermen for generations . But as natural resources dwindled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an arrest for poaching just another risk of the business . <p> But the wealthy patrons who supported refuges and sanctuaries around the world did n't see it in that practical light . No refuge manager would want his patron 's newsletter to ring with the headline : Former poacher hired as field biologist . <p> It had never mattered how well he did in school . <p> But he 'd come too far in life to go back to the boats , so he 'd taken a job with Mr. Ryan instead . Ryan did not believe in nonprofit enterprises . When a U.N . mandate required every corporate entity that generated potential ocean garbage to construct and maintain an Ocean Hazards Collection Station , Ryan had expanded on the design by adding the shark pen . <p> Shark fins were much in demand and now nearly unobtainable since the wild populations had been hunted almost to extinction . Tiburon 's fins alone would fetch twice Zayder 's yearly wages each time they could be regrown and harvested . Ryan 's select market held the great white shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported in nearly five years . Speculation held the captive animal to be the last of its species . <p> But beyond the income from fins , the station was useful to Ryan in other ways . So Zayder finally found himself employed again , master of a remote world built on a reef in the South China Sea . <p> The deep blue sky lightened as he ran . The pink fair-weather clouds that hugged the horizon gradually brightened until they were bathed in brilliant white . A moment later the rim of the sun appeared above the water . Zayder ducked his head , his thoughts blown back to the present by the sudden blast of daylight . <p> A hundred meters out on the sun-burnished water a black torpedo armed with a spine of pentagonal fins scudded toward the station : one of the robotic garbage trawlers being driven home by a combination of the light breeze against its adjustable fins and a solar-powered engine . Its collecting tentacles trailed a hundred meters behind it : some on the surface , some searching out the depths below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old plastics , netting , glass , metal , and organic debris bound for the station 's recycling bins . <p> Zayder slowed to watch the trawler come in . At the same moment a white-noise explosion of water erupted from the pen , scarcely a body length away . Startled instinct slammed him backward as the geyser of white water lunged toward him . A solid shape appeared as the pearly water fell away . He recognized the massive , lead-gray profile of a great white shark , its fins fully grown and its maw open , its upper jaw thrust forward to expose rows of triangular teeth . Tiburon ! Spray washed over Zayder as he threw himself back , a split second before the five-meter shark slammed onto the deck . The whole structure shuddered . Fracture lines bloomed in the photovoltaic panels beneath Tiburon 's belly . The shark fixed him with its manic black eyes . It thrashed on the deck , jaws snapping in an effort to get at him . He felt the rush of air as the teeth closed within centimeters of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He jumped back again . The shark thrust forward . Its torso was draped on the deck . but its great tail was still in the water , fanning the surface into a violent foam . " Back in , you fucker ! " Zayder screamed . <p> The shark snapped twice more , then grew still . Its eyes still fixed on him , it slid silently back into the water . <p> Zayder stood on the deck , his shoulders heaving , a torrent of curses spilling from his mouth . Tiburon was the oldest , biggest monster in the pen . Zayder had harvested his fins five times , each time salving the wounds with a regenerative balm that forced the valuable fins to regrow . Five times he 'd nursed Tiburon in the recovery channels , where pumps forced a steady torrent of water over the helpless shark as it writhed on the bottom of a narrow steel chute . <p> " I 'll take your fins again this afternoon , " Zayder growled . Cautiously , he stepped forward , to peer over the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathom down . <p> Suddenly the shark turned , cruising slowly out about fifty meters toward the center of the pen until Zayder lost sight of it . A moment later Tiburon reappeared , still a fathom below the surface , his great tail flailing as he charged the wall of the shark pen . Zayder got ready to dodge a second lunge . But Tiburon had his own designs . He rammed the wall of the pen with his snout . The blow shook the structure . Zayder stumbled , swaying to keep his balance . He almost went down . <p> What the hell was going on ? Was the damn fish trying to knock him off the deck ? Tiburon took off again for the center of the pen . Zayder turned , ready to run for the shed and his tranquilizing harpoon , when a low moan reached his ears . " Help , man . Help me , " a tired voice croaked . <p> It came from the ocean side of the deck . Zayder glanced over his shoulder . Tiburon had turned . Quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spy a young man  --  probably no more than twenty  --  adrift in the light swell , a few meters outside the steel mesh . The sun shone full in his pale face as his bare feet trod the water in quick , frantic strokes . His dark hair floated like an ink cloud around his shoulders , blending imperceptibly with his black shirt . He sputtered , his eyes pleading with Zayder for help . <p> Looking at him , Zayder grinned in sudden relief . No wonder the shark had been pumped into a manic state . Tiburon had smelled game in the water . And just where had this stray fish come from ? He could guess . The garbage trawlers had brought bodies in before  --  though never live ones . The trawler tentacles were designed to detect and avoid living organic structures . But Zayder knew that clothing could confuse them . <p> Just then , the shark rammed the wall of the pen again . The deck shuddered . " Not this time , you man-eating bastard , " Zayder muttered . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundering stranger . The water was a meter and a half below . " Here , " he barked . " See if you can reach me . I 'll pull you up . " <p> The kid shook his head , his mouth twisting in pain . " Ca n't , " he panted . " Hands are bound . " <p> Zayder scowled . And who had bound his hands and dropped him into the sea ? Maybe it was better not to know . Zayder did n't want to get sucked into the personal affairs of men like Ryan . <p> The stranger seemed to read his thoughts . He closed his eyes , leaned back farther in the water and stopped kicking , as if waiting for Zayder to decide whether he would live or die . Zayder cursed softly . <p> Men like Ryan might have a choice . But he wanted never to be a man like Ryan . Quickly stripping off his shoes , he slipped over the side of the deck and into the water . <p> The ocean 's cool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroked to the stranger , hooked an arm across his chest and dragged him along the pen wall , nearly sixty meters to a maintenance ladder . He tried not to see the huge shadow that cruised back and forth , back and forth , just a few meters away on the other side of the steel mesh . But he could feel the kid watching . <p> Zayder did n't blame him . The mesh was n't designed to inspire confidence . It had a gauge wide enough to allow Zayder to wriggle through if he had to . The shark seemed appallingly near . <p> To distract the kid , he asked : " How 'd you get the trawler to let you go ? " <p> The kid 's eyes squinched shut . Then in hoarse English , dignified with a slight British accent , he explained : " I was floating motionless in the water when the trawler took me .... It grabbed me around the chest , and dragged me . It was moving so fast , I could n't fight it . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I twisted and kicked until it let me go ... why ? Motion ... characteristic of living organisms . The trawler 's ... not supposed to be hazard to sea life ... so I suspect motion ... stimulated my release . " <p> Zayder began to regret asking the question . Who the hell was this kid ? He reached the ladder , then hooked an arm around the lowest rung , heaved the kid over his shoulder and climbed out . " I think I can walk , " the kid gasped . Zayder did n't believe him . He laid him carefully on the deck , then checked for Tiburon . The fish was cruising out toward the center of the pen again , so Zayder took a moment to check the bindings that held the kid 's arms pinioned behind his back . <p> He discovered two ropes : one at the elbows , one at the wrists . The kid 's palms were pale and wrinkled from exposure to water . A lacy network of blood seeped across them from his finger tips . His finger tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . This kid had no finger tips . His fingers were torn , bloody stubs , taken off at the first joint . " Holy mother , " he whispered . " Who did this to you ? . <p> The kid blinked , an odd look of wonder on his face as he lay on the deck . " The shark , " he whispered in his cultured accent . " I was holding onto the mesh . My fingers were inside . I did n't see it coming . " He turned his head , to look out across the pen . Zayder followed his gaze . Tiburon had turned . He was driving hard for the mesh again . " I never saw a shark before . " He smiled in a dizzy , distracted way . " I ca n't believe how lucky I am to see one . " <p> Zayder scooped him up and ran for the shed as Tiburon hit the mesh one more time . <p> The kid had passed out by the time Zayder got him inside . Blood oozed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had closed down and the flow was minuscule . Zayder bandaged each finger . In the airconditioned shed the kid 's skin felt cold , so Zayder stripped off his wet clothes and bundled him in a stale-smelling blanket . Then he sat down on the floor beside the pile of clothing , pausing only to note the pricey designer names before going through the pockets . <p> He found a credit card and an I.D. , both in the name of Commarin Wong . And he found an electronic device , a black cylinder some seven centimeters long and one in diameter . It had an on/off button and a working light . The corporate name embossed on the housing was Guidestar , a company that dealt in geographical positioning equipment . Zayder guessed that the device was a transponder , presently inactive . But who was it intended to signal ? He slipped the instrument into his own pocket as his earlier worries returned . Just who had tossed this kid overboard ? And would n't they come looking for him if they learned he was alive ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , in case anyone came looking . <p> He 'd started to stand , when he caught sight of the bloodstained sheets . Damn . He 'd have to get rid of the sheets too . And then there was the matter of the kid himself : Commarin Wong . The name tickled some partial memory . Commarin Wong . As if he should have recognized it . <p> The kid groaned in his sleep . A moment later his eyelids fluttered . He stared at the ceiling for a moment , then he turned his head . His gaze took in Zayder 's face , before fixing on the company graphic on the breast of Zayder 's T-shirt : Ryanco . What little color there was in Commarin 's pale face seemed to drain away . <p> Zayder felt fear run in harsh prickles across his own skin . He did n't want to cross Ryan . He should call in ; report the incident . He cursed his shark-hunting youth , and the arrest that had ultimately forced him to work for human sharks . He cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why does Mr. Ryan want you dead. ? " he asked , his voice deliberately hard-edged . <p> A faint , self-deprecating smile flickered across Commarin 's pale lips . " He does n't want me dead , " he said , his voice barely more than a whisper , hoarse from a night of strangling on salt water . " He wants me back . " <p> Zayder resented what he believed to be a lie . " That was you screaming last night , was n't it ? They bound your hands and threw you off that freighter , right ? Well , you might have noticed , Commarin Wong , they did n't send a boat after you . " <p> Again , that self-effacing flash of a smile . " That 's what happened , " he agreed . " But you have the advantage of me . " <p> " The name 's Zayder Silveira . Mr. Ryan 's my boss , and I need this job . " <p> " Zayder Silveira ? " Commarin shoved himself up on an elbow . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , An Observational History of a Juvenile Great White Shark . It was a stunning exercise in open ocean research . I 'm honored to meet you . " <p> Zayder blinked , astonished at this outburst , and the unexpected reminder of better days . The juvenile stage of the white shark 's life cycle had been virtually unknown before he 'd netted his subject in the Indian Ocean . He 'd tagged the little shark , then followed its beacon for three months . But his research ended prematurely when it trailed the scent of death to carcasses entangled in an abandoned drift net . Before long the white shark became entangled too . <p> That study had turned out to be the last published account of a living great white . Zayder had hooked Tiburon three years later , but by then he 'd been working for Ryan . <p> " Are you continuing your shark studies here ? " Commarin asked . He seemed suddenly invigorated : his dark eyes sparkled with curiosity , his pale cheeks bore a faint flush of excitement . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes before as he pressed Zayder for more information . " Is Ryan supporting your research ? " <p> Watching him , Zayder felt a flash of anger . He had n't pulled a man from the ocean . He 'd only salvaged a spoiled corporate brat who did n't know enough about the real world to appreciate his own jeopardy . <p> " Yeah , " Zayder said , his voice ugly with sarcasm . " I came here to study the sharks . That 's right . Mr. Ryan 's real interested in natural history . " <p> Commarin 's expression dimmed . He looked away . " You 're right , of course . Ryan 's not interested in natural history . I know that . It 's all money to him . " He knotted the blanket in his fist . " That 's why I had to leave . " <p> His voice had descended to a barely audible whisper , but there was something compelling in it , leading Zayder to wonder if his judgment had been too harsh . He stood up thoughtfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you leave ? " he asked , as Commarin drank thirstily . <p> Commarin lowered the cup . For the first time , he seemed angry . " Ryan 's my patron , you know . He considers me his prodigy . He 's supported me since I was five , the best schools , all of that . I took my degree in genetics . It 's what he wanted ; not what I wanted . I wanted to study natural history , like you . " <p> Commarin Wong . Zayder grimaced as he suddenly recognized the name . Commarin Wong was the new star of Ryan 's genetic labs . Far more than a corporate brat , he was a hand-fed prince raised to augment Ryan 's empire . <p> " That 's the expression most colleagues get when they realize who I am , " Commarin said resentfully . <p> Zayder felt himself backing away emotionally . " I 'm no colleague of yours , " he growled . " I do n't know anything about constructing genetically specific drugs  --  and I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite hobby . " <p> " No , you 're not , " Commarin shot back . " You 're the poacher who took a degree in natural history . A poacher . With a black mark like that , it 's no wonder you could n't get a real job . So now you work for Ryan . " <p> " You know , you 're a real wise-ass . " <p> " I work for Ryan too . " <p> " Sounds like you owe him . " <p> " I 'm not his slave . I 'm not going back . " <p> Zayder nodded slowly . Hell , if he had any choice , he 'd run too . " So what happened on that ship ? " <p> The fire seemed to go out of Commarin . He lay back against the pillow . " I stowed away on one of Ryan 's ships . It seemed like the perfect opportunity . But I did n't do my research first . It seems the captain has had an ongoing problem with stowaways trying to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Neither do I. But why did n't you just tell him you were a corporate brat on Ryan 's A list ? " <p> " Do n't you think I tried ? He did n't believe me . " <p> By the time Zayder got Commarin fed and asleep , the morning was almost gone . He dismissed any thought of doing the scheduled maintenance on the garbage trawlers , and instead got his harpoon . It was time to go after Tiburon . <p> The harpoon 's darts were armed with a neurotoxin that would stimulate the shark to bask at the surface in a state of slowly moving somnolence in which it could be roped and winched to the recovery channels for surgery . <p> Zayder walked up and down the deck , squinting against the glare on the water as he tried to identify Tiburon amongst the many shadows that swam slowly through the mid-levels of the pen . He hoped to take Tiburon without entering the water . He let his feet pound a rhythm on the deck for half an hour , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the shed and pulled out his diving gear . <p> He did n't go into the water often , but sometimes it was necessary . It was n't so dangerous . There were only two or three really aggressive sharks , and he could hold them off with the harpoon . <p> He was coupling the respirator to the tank when Commarin emerged from the cabin , dressed in a set of Zayder 's company shorts and T-shirt , the clothing oversized on his smaller frame . He looked drained , but sound . <p> He watched Zayder for a moment , but his restless gaze did n't linger . It scanned the sky , the ocean , the surface waters of the pen . " You have n't said what you 're going to do about me . " <p> Zayder grunted . He had n't decided . <p> " You found the transponder ? " Commarin asked . <p> Zayder scowled . " Was that your sissy stick ? To call Mr. Ryan when you 'd had enough salt water and decided to be a good boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alone , " he said . ' q have friends in Brazil . They 're waiting for my signal to pick me up . " <p> Zayder punched a flow button on the respirator . He noted in satisfaction that the harsh rush of air made Commarin jump . " You 're a lucky man to have a job waiting for you . What 'll you be doing ? Making lethal genetic weapons for the other side ? " <p> " No . I 'll be working on the genetics of endangered species in the Brazilian preserves . " <p> Zayder froze . He 'd tried to get work at a preserve in Brazil , one that supported a riparian environment that ran all the way to the sea . Sharks were known to feed in the murky waters of a river 's mouth , where the occasional animal carcass would wash out from the forest . Such a lucky man . <p> A gray fin cut the water in the pen , just a few meters away . Zayder tended over a hundred sharks in this pen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the organic garbage the trawlers brought in . <p> He watched the fin glide by . He 'd learned to recognize each shark as an individual . This one he could identify by the fin alone . " Tiburon , " he whispered . <p> Silently , he laid the tank on the deck and picked up the harpoon . <p> Commarin must have noted the change in his gaze , because he turned . His eyes widened as the shark doubled back . It glided even closer to the deck this time . As it slid by , its head rose half out of the water and its ancient eyes seemed to fix on Commarin . <p> Zayder had seen this sort of behavior before . " That 's Tiburon , " he said . " The one that took off your finger tips . Sharks pick their victim . Guess he figures you belong to him now . " <p> " Are they so intelligent ? " Commarin asked . He hurried to the edge of the deck , where he dropped to his knees and leaned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide . Tiburon was only a few meters off the deck . The great fish turned suddenly , his tail churning the water as he raced back toward Commarin . <p> Zayder got there first . He grabbed Commarin by his shirt , yanked him to his feet and threw him back toward the shed . The shark turned abruptly and descended back into the water without striking . <p> " You got ta death wish ? " Zayder shouted . <p> Commarin did n't answer . His face reflected fear as he looked out across the ocean , where the low rumble of a distant helicopter had suddenly become audible . Zayder darted to the ocean-edge of the deck . He saw the machine , a speck on the horizon , skimming the waves as it bore straight for the station . He turned to Commarin . " Looks like Ryan 's found your trail . " <p> Commarin nodded grimly . <p> " I could try to hide you . But it 's useless . If they suspect you 're here , they 'll search the station . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his expression suddenly as empty as the shark 's . " I wo n't make trouble for you . " <p> Zayder could remember the desire . It was not so long ago when he 'd still allowed himself to dream of the great marine preserves off Australia , off Africa . All he 'd ever wanted was to know the ocean , to untangle its secrets . He would have done anything to be permitted to study in those preserves . <p> Commarin shared that hunger . He 'd gambled his life for it , on a wire-thin chance to evade Ryan . And he was about to lose . <p> Zayder 's gaze fixed on the diving equipment on the deck . " Underwater , " he muttered . Then he looked up at Commarin . " They might not look for you underwater . " <p> He sent Commarin to a network of caves in the reef , just outside the steel mesh wall of the shark pen . He had him take the bloody bedding and clothing with him , because there was n't time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can stay down for fifty minutes , no more . " <p> From inside the pen , Tiburon watched Commarin drop into the water ; the shark disappeared into the depths in parallel with the young man . <p> Zayder returned to the shed to find the helicopter already down , the rotor slowing to visibility as the craft bobbed on pontoons a few meters off the station . The helicopter 's doors had been removed . Mr. Ryan liked it that way . <p> A bodyguard leaned out from the passenger side to catch the rope Zayder tossed . Another half-rose from his position in the back seat , his automatic weapon cradled across his chest . Ryan held the pilot 's seat . <p> After the rope was secured , Zayder pulled the helicopter close to the deck so the party could climb up . Then he let it drift a few meters out on the swell . <p> The two bodyguards ignored him . Weapons in hand , they set off through the station . Ryan turned to Zayder . He was a big man , thick-necked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building 's shade and removed his sunglasses . From his Chinese mother , he had dark hair and pale skin . From his Caucasian father , he had blue eyes and the bearing of a shark . " A valuable man was lost at sea last night , " he told Zayder . " The incident occurred near here . " <p> Zayder nodded . " A garbage trawler brought him in . " <p> Ryan smiled coldly . " I missed your report , " he said . " Where is he ? " <p> Zayder glanced nervously at the waters of the pen . The smile on Ryan 's face disappeared , to be replaced by a stony frown . " I did n't get to him in time , " Zayder said . " At dawn I saw the great white feeding on the body . The trawler must have classified it as organic garbage and dumped it into the pen . " <p> The pale color of Ryan 's face deepened to the coppery blush of sunset . " You did n't try to recover the remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still bristling , returned his stare for a long moment . Then suddenly he seemed to relax . The color in his cheeks eased and a sly look came over his face . " Bring me the shark , " he said . " I want its fins . " <p> Zayder started . But Ryan had already turned away from him . He barked a brief order , and the two bodyguards reappeared from the shed . " We 're going shark hunting , " Ryan told them . He turned to Zayder . " Perhaps we can still recover some evidence of our young man from the belly of the shark . " <p> Zayder felt a cold flush of horror . " No ! The great white may be the last of its species . If you slit its belly , you 'll kill it . You 'll kill the species . " <p> Ryan 's eyes narrowed . " That would be a terrible thing , " he agreed . " And I would be very upset if I did such a thing , only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Zayder 's chest , then drew a hard line down to his belly . " I might feel the need to similarly gut the man who had misled me . " <p> The bodyguards leveled their weapons at Zayder 's chest . Zayder stiffened , but his gaze remained fixed on Ryan 's face . " I 'll need the harpoon , " he said . It was still lying on the deck , where he 'd left it after his aborted hunt for Tiburon . <p> Ryan took a step back , then stooped to pick it up . " I 'll handle the weapon , " he said . " You find the shark . " <p> Sharks were unpredictable . Zayder had never developed a reliable way of calling them , except to chum the water with blood . Ryan knew that . But Ryan wanted Tiburon now . Zayder squinted as his gaze swept across the surface waters of the pen . It had been ten minutes since Commarin slipped into the ocean . Tiburon had seemed to follow . Zayder remembered the fury of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from its selected prey . " All right , " he said . " I think I know where I can find him . " <p> Zayder led them along the deck , some three hundred meters , until they neared the point above the underwater caves in which Commarin was hiding . He imagined Tiburon below , listening to the vibrations of their footsteps , the shark 's blood fury roused by the scent of inaccessible Commarin . He searched the clear blue water inside the pen . Smaller sharks swept past , their movements quick , agitated . Cautiously , Zayder crouched at the edge of the deck . He could feel Ryan 's presence close behind him . " Well ? " Ryan demanded . <p> Zayder thought he saw a huge gray shadow in sinuous motion far below . Come on , Tiburon . You vicious old bastard . <p> The shadow turned , circled , then began driving toward the surface . Zayder looked up to see Ryan staring at the charging shark . " He 's the last of his species , " Zayder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ryan raised the harpoon ; took aim . The bodyguards moved up beside him , edging close to the deck , even leaning over , so they could see the action . The shadow of the shark seemed to grow enormously large as it approached . Sweat appeared on Ryan 's cheeks . " It 's not slowing down ! " he hissed . <p> Zayder readied himself . As Tiburon burst from the water , Zayder dove diagonally across the deck  --  and collided with Ryan ! Ryan blocked his way  --  and he 'd failed to fire the harpoon . Instead , he 'd thrown himself back , rolling to safety across the deck as the shark crashed onto the black surface of the photovoltaic cells . Zayder scrambled to escape Tiburon 's snapping jaws . But the shark was faster . He felt the huge triangular teeth rake furrows in his leg . He screamed and clawed at the deck , slithering away . Twisting around , he looked back in time to see the thrashing shark snap at one of the bodyguards . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . The man never even screamed as his spine was snapped . Then the shark shook its massive head . Blood flew as it dropped its victim . It turned to the second bodyguard and lunged , snapping once , twice as the screaming man scrabbled across a deck that was suddenly slick with blood . Tiburon 's maw closed on the man 's leg , taking it off just above the knee . <p> Then , as if he 'd collected his due , the shark slipped quietly back into the water . <p> Zayder found himself on hands and knees in the center of the blood-washed deck . The wounded man was screaming . The bleeding corpse shuddered on the deck . His own leg felt as if fiery brands were burning into his flesh . He choked on the pain . <p> Suddenly , the bolt of the harpoon was thrust in his face . He stared at the double image of the steel point as it hovered , out of focus , scant centimeters from his eyes . He looked past the point to see Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where is Commarin ? " Ryan shouted . " Where is he ? " <p> " Tiburon , " Zayder gasped . " I told you  --  " <p> " No more lies ! That shark has not fed . Where is he ? Where is Commarin ? Tell me now , or you 'll die . Tell me , because I 'm going to find him anyway . " <p> The screams of the wounded man were growing feebler . He was bleeding to death while his boss continued to pursue the quarry . <p> In the pen , the waters were no longer calm . Sharks were gathering , drawn by the huge quantities of blood that continued to drain into the water . Zayder glanced quickly at the frothing , whirling maelstrom of fins , knowing his own death would lie there if he gave in to Ryan . <p> Tiburon had never given in . Not even after his fins had been cut off five times , five times regrown in the coursing waters of the recovery channels . He 'd just gotten bigger and meaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to jump over the deck to freedom . <p> All this passed through his mind in the space of a trembling breath . And then he made his decision . " Fuck you , Ryan , " he muttered . <p> Ducking quickly , he rolled off the deck . He heard Ryan scream at him , but the sound was cut off by the water as he plunged into the pen , just on the edge of the frenzy . <p> Zayder opened his eyes to the brine . He saw dark shadows dart toward him . The water was murky with blood . He stretched out ' his body and reached for the mesh of the shark pen 's wall . He kicked . Harsh skin scraped his ribs as a shark brushed against him . He kicked harder . His fingers found the mesh . A gray shape loomed out of the froth and murk . Maw open , teeth bared , it bore down on him . He jammed his head through the mesh , wriggled to get his shoulders through . The shark turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pulled himself all the way through . <p> He surfaced under the deck , gasping for air . His eyes were closed in a grimace of pain as he fought the urge to scream . Ryan was on the deck , just above . But there was so much blood in the water ! Ryan would have to believe he was dead . He would have to . <p> " Zayder ! " a voice hissed , not an arm 's length from his ear . <p> He jumped in shock . His eyes flew open to see Commarin adrift in the water beside him , still wearing the diving gear , his bandaged hands awkward as he paddled to stay afloat . <p> A wave of dizziness swept over him . He could sense blood from the wound in his leg pumping into the ocean . He could still feel the frantic thrashings of the frenzy in the currents driven through the mesh . His trembling hands stroked the water . " Ryan knows you 're here , " he whispered to Commarin . " His goons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He reached into his pocket to remove the transponder . Sinking deeper into the water , he thrust it at Commarin . " Take this , " he hissed . " Make your way around the pen until you find a garbage trawler in port . Check the ready lights on the berth . Find one that 's nearly charged . Use your knife to remove the tentacles , then tie yourself to it . It 'll take you a hundred klicks out by morning if it senses no weight on its limbs . Your friends will be able to retrieve you safely . " <p> " You 're coming too , " Commarin said anxiously . <p> Zayder 's lip curled in anger . " Do n't think so , Commarin . Tiburon nicked my leg . Blood 's still flowing . I 've got to get out of the water . " <p> " But Ryan 's there . " <p> " I 've dealt with sharks before . Now go . Go ! Get out of here . I want to see Ryan lose for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not a chance . I got you into this mess . I 'm not going to abandon you now . Look , if we can get to that helicopter , we can both get out of here . " <p> " I do n't know how to fly a helicopter . " <p> " I do . " <p> * * * Staying under the deck , they moved around the perimeter of the shark pen toward the shed and the moored helicopter . A long gray shadow dogged them on the other side of the mesh : Tiburon . Coursing back and forth , back and forth , the shark 's ceaseless motion focused on their slow progress . <p> They reached the shed without incident . The helicopter bobbed on the light swell only a few meters away . There was no sign of Ryan . <p> " He was uninjured , " Zayder hissed . " He 'll have called for reinforcements by now . " <p> The light tread of a foot overhead alerted them . The shark swam past , turned , swam past again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the hiss/roar of the swell rising and falling against the mesh . " I know where you are , Commarin . Your toothy escort is less shy about showing himself than you are . Come out , Commarin . There 's little to fear . You know I 'm a practical man . " <p> To Zayder the words seemed to be amplified , reverberating under the deck . The voice might have been that of the shark , a dual entity , inescapable in its reach . He leaned back in the water , conscious of a soft roar in his ears that was the helpless static of oxygen-starved nerves . Some part of him knew he was bleeding to death . Salt water splashed into his mouth . He started to choke . He reached for the mesh to keep from sinking , but suddenly Commarin was there , buoying him up with bandaged hands , hissing something about Tiburon . And then : " We have to try to swim underwater to the other side of the helicopter . " <p> Zayder shook his head , fumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No good ! " he whispered . " Ryan 's armed . Even if you managed to take off , Ryan could still bring you down . Have to get rid of Ryan first . " <p> But how ? His mind seemed to be bobbing about on the surface of a swell . He had trouble focusing on a single train of thought . He felt as if the trailing tentacles of a garbage trawler had become tangled in his brain , each tentacle pulling the neural tissue in a different direction . <p> One tentacle , one direction . Garbage in , garbage out . He twisted around in Commarin 's arms . " A garbage trawler brought you in . " <p> Commarin nodded slowly . <p> " Find one that 's charged and ready . " <p> " No . I told you I wo n't leave without you . " <p> Ryan 's voice boomed again from overhead . " Commarin , Commarin , why so stubborn ? When are you going to realize that hiding under the deck is no solution ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the deck overhead . " I was thinking this time we could go trawling for sharks . " <p> Commarin frowned , but he helped Zayder swim to the nearest trawler 's berth . Zayder glanced at the maintenance panel . It indicated the unit was charged and ready to go , awaiting only its turn in the schedule . Tiburon slipped past inside the pen . Zayder was peripherally aware of the wake of the great fish as he lifted his hand to touch the panel . " You want to send it early , " he told Commarin , his voice barely audible , even in his own ears . " You press this . But first we take off the tentacles , all but one . " <p> It was an easy operation . The snap-in modules popped out , until only one was left . " Unwind it a bit , " Zayder said , clinging to the trawler 's housing . " It wo n't stick to your skin ; only to your clothes . " Ducking underwater , he struggled out of his company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tentacle in his bare hands . It felt smooth and soft and only mildly sticky . " When I hit the deck , " he said , " you launch the trawler . " <p> " Zayder  --  " <p> Zayder grabbed the maintenance ladder and started climbing , his steps deliberately loud against the peaceful mutter of the ocean . His head crested the deck , and he saw Ryan . <p> Ryan seemed surprised to see him . He quickly brought up the muzzle of his weapon . " I thought you 'd be shark food by now , " he growled . <p> " Commarin 's hurt , " Zayder croaked . " Help haul him up . Ca n't do it myself . Injured .... " <p> Ryan crept forward cautiously . A meter and a half away , he leaned over the edge of the deck , as if to check whether Commarin really was clinging to the ladder . Zayder judged it his best moment . <p> He launched himself onto the deck , hitting it belly first and sliding toward the startled Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't cling to living flesh . But it would happily wrap around Ryan 's clothed leg . <p> Zayder threw it against him as he slid past . Ryan dropped the gun . He bent down , his bare fingers tearing at the tentacle . " Now , Commarin ! " Zayder screamed . <p> But Commarin had already launched the garbage trawler . Zayder saw the finned torpedo from the corner of his eye , speeding out to sea . Ryan saw it too ; saw the connection that bound him to it . He gave one hard yank on the tentacle as a snarl escaped his lips , and then the craft yanked him into the water . Zayder watched him go : dark , fishy figure in a white , foaming wake . <p> The garbage trawler would stay out until it had accumulated its weight capacity or until thirty days had passed , whichever came first . Given that it had only one tentacle to gather trash from the water , Zayder knew that it would not return in Ryan 's lifetime . He closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the roar of the helicopter that roused him . He awoke to find himself strapped into the passenger seat as the craft slowly lifted into the air . Looking down through the open doorway , he could see the shed , the recovery chutes , the black photovoltaic panels that defined the pen , the sinuous bodies of the collection of captive sharks . He thought he could pick out Tiburon among them . He 'd taken the great white 's fins five times , and every time , he 'd forced them to regrow . <p> He turned quickly to Commarin . " Go back , " he croaked . " Go back a moment . " <p> " There 's no time ! Ryan 's people will be here  --  " <p> " There , " Zayder said , pointing to the shattered section of deck where Tiburon had lunged at him only that morning . The bodies of Ryan 's men were n't far away . " Please , Commarin . " <p> Reluctantly , Commarin set the craft down in the water just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling at his back , he stroked to the nearest trawler 's berth . It was the machine that had brought Commarin in ; nearly half-charged now . Half would be enough . Zayder seized one of the tentacles , pulled it out of the module and dragged it to the mesh . Tiburon cruised into sight . Zayder laughed bitterly . " Looking for another taste of me , you old bastard ? " He waited for the shark to pass , then quickly wrapped the tentacle around the mesh and watched it take hold . Then he went back to the trawler and activated it . <p> It hummed softly for a moment , then sped out of its housing , the tentacle paying out behind it . Zayder ducked under the tentacle and stroked back to the idling helicopter as quickly as he could . Commarin helped him climb aboard . " What the hell are you doing ? " he demanded , as Zayder collapsed into the seat . <p> " Just get us out of here , quick , " Zayder muttered . <p> The tentacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the mesh bowing outward under the strain . " Hit it , Tiburon , " he muttered . " Hit it hard . " <p> The shark seemed to hear him . Or perhaps its carefully cultured fury alone led it to attack the mesh . But as the helicopter lifted , Zayder could see the long gray shadow charge the wall of the pen . <p> The impact caused the deck to visibly shudder . The cracked photovoltaic panel split fully in two . The trawler lurched forward , submerged for a moment , then bobbed to the surface again as the tentacle snapped . <p> Zayder screamed in fury ! The pen had held , and the sharks were still trapped in the artificial confines of a tiny , protected ocean . The helicopter lifted higher into the afternoon . The dark shapes of the great fish swam in their ancient , enduring journey , round and round the closed walls of their sanctuary . All but one . <p> Zayder saw it as Commarin banked the helicopter . The afternoon sun blazed on the blue water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalous patch of night sped into the open ocean . He saw it a for a second , maybe two , and then the fish sought deeper waters , its sinister shape disappearing into the blue . <p> " It 's a man-eater , " Commarin said . " It killed two men . " <p> " It 's part of this world . " <p> Commarin shook his head . " It 's part of the past . It 'll be hunted down . " <p> " I know . " And when Tiburon was finally taken by hook or net , the species would be extinct . No sanctuary or reserve could change that . <p> Had the notion of sanctuary always been illusory ? His leg throbbed where the shark 's teeth had raked him . " I 'm going back to the fishing boats , " he said . <p> Commarin looked startled . " No . You 're a trained scientist . Come with me . There 'll be a place for you  --  " <p> But Zayder was n't listening . In his mind he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hunter : the original students of the natural world . <p> He followed the great shark all the way back to his own fading origins . There were no sanctuaries in the open ocean  --  not for pelagic sharks or for deep-water fishermen . There never could be . But he would go back . He would fish , until that life was finally , fully played out on the open sea . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Linda Nagata <p> Linda Nagata recently published her third science fiction novel in as many years , Deception Well . She lives in Hawaii and says that in twenty-four years of swimming in Hawaiian waters she has never seen a shark ( and hopes never to do so ) . <p>
