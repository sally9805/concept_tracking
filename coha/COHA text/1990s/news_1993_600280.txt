<p> What is it you want out of life ? <p> Do you want your closet organized by color ? Do you want the perfect wedding for your daughter ? Do you want to be able to mix and match your dishes and not make a fool of yourself in the process ? <p> Admit it . You 'd love to put Martha Stewart to shame . You want more than just a life . You want a lifestyle . <p> Well , then , Colin Cowie is your man . <p> Just when you thought there was no hope , here 's a guy who will take care of your life . Almost every facet of it . The only thing he wo n't do is serve you dinner on anything resembling disposable paper . He hates it . <p> But if you want to spend half a million on a party , he 's right there for you , champagne flutes in hand . <p> And now Cowie , who runs Colin Cowie Lifestyles here , is bringing his organizational skills to you . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Living With Style , are expected out next year . He hopes a TV show will follow . He can already envision programs on entertaining , redecorating , flower buying , cooking , planning a wedding . <p> He knows a few things about weddings . Cowie pulled together Hugh Hefner and Kimberley Conrad 's $ 1 million wedding in just five weeks : 10,000 white roses ( with their own air conditioning ) , mandatory suntans on the ushers , and no little bride and groom atop the cake , thank you . He also had an extra pair of shoes ready , one-half size larger , in case the bride 's feet should swell during the festivities . <p> He did last year 's smaller wedding for his friend Kenny G , too . There were only 2,000 fully blown white roses , but Michael Bolton did serenade the couple . ( And the outfits you see Kenny G wearing on his Breathless tour this spring ? Yes , Cowie put them together . ) <p> His hand even shows up on the honeymoon , where he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 15 pounds of rose petals scattered around the Jacuzzi . " I do n't just do the wedding , " Cowie says . " I do the whole thing . " <p> This month he 's doing nine parties , including three weddings . " I ca n't really do more than that , " he says . " It 's like producing little movies . " <p> So how much is a Colin Cowie affair , you ask ? He hedges . " I do n't like to talk money , " he says , but then concedes that his flat fee can range between $ 12,000 and $ 20,000 . That 's just his fee . That 's not the caterer , the food , the flowers , the liquor or the hall , which so far has never been the local firehouse . It can very quickly add up to the other side of $ 100,000 . Cost per person at one of these events starts at $ 200 and goes up . <p> People magazine calls him " Mr. Detail " and says his word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native South Africa dub him the " jet set 's high priest . " Bride 's magazine calls him " ace party planner . " And Hefner 's right-hand man , Richard Rosenzweig , following the wedding , said his taste was " boarding on impeccable , as impeccable as we know in the L.A. area . " <p> " I always knew , from childhood , that I 'd be doing this kind of work , " he says today . Cowie grew up in a formal ( " we dressed for dinner " ) copper-mining family in Zimbabwe . After a few jobs in South Africa - he managed a conference center there - he headed to California . And then his break came . He was invited to a luncheon and was so appalled by the food , the flowers , the service , that he made his friend promise he could do her next charity event . He did , it was a smash success , and the jobs started rolling in . <p> " He thinks of things I do n't even know about . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only client , " says Sheri Rivera of Los Angeles , who has used Cowie 's services four times . Cowie will be doing a party for her again in June . For 80 . <p> At 31 , Cowie knows starlets and superstars galore . Demi Moore called him to plan a surprise Monte Carlo casino party for hubby Bruce Willis ' birthday . But probably more importantly , he also knows many of those more private ladies who lunch over at the Hotel Bel Air . Cowie has become one of their pets . They chat about the help , the china , the husband , the upcoming poolside party . And not necessarily in that order . <p> " I 'm a very good listener , " he admits . And mum 's always the word . Cowie says his staff too has to abide by his rule that once a function is over " their lips must be sealed when they leave . " <p> " I 've had book deals to write about my clients , but I wo n't , " Cowie says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pair of underwear some of them have , and when you maintain that kind of relationship , they trust you . " <p> " He has a temperament that just makes you feel comfortable , " says Margo Barbakow , of Montecito , Calif. , who has used Cowie several times , including for her son 's birthday party , which was a backyard circus . " Colin comes in and just exudes a calmness . It 's all very second nature to him . You do n't have to worry . It 's going to be perfect . Tasteful . Classy . " <p> He says many people just do n't know what to do when it comes to pulling their life together . And money , for some reason , does n't seem to help . <p> " I have clients with enormous homes , with walk-in refrigerators and huge kitchens , and they 're eating out five nights a week , " Cowie says . " They do n't understand that all you have to do is have some pasta , a green salad , cut some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the evening . " <p> Things are different in the ' 90s , he says . More honest , for one . " It 's time to reinstitute the social graces . In the ' 80s we all went to flashy restaurants to impress one another . It 's more important now to show how we care . " <p> But the nice thing about Cowie is that , within the parameters of good taste , of course , he 'll do whatever you want . He wo n't shove his " taste " down clients ' throats . <p> If you want a nearly nude reclining woman amid your brie and grapes buffet , he 'll do it , and has . If you want the waiters to change clothes between courses , he 'll do that too , and has . He 'll even arrange for your hair and makeup and outfit before the first guest rings that doorbell . <p> He 'll also design your home and organize the people who work there . Cowie will put together a loose-leaf binder guide that will instruct your staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how to answer the phone . Ballpark figure for such a book : $ 5,000 to $ 12,000 . <p> " What I do is spend a couple of nights in the home , " says Cowie , then he builds the staff around what the master of the house wants - " from the most formal to the most casual . " <p> Cowie 's household books can be so specific there can be photos to show how items - note pad , telephone , tennis balls , water - should be set up at the courts " when Mr. B. calls and says he 's bringing someone home for tennis in an hour . " <p> Cowie 's goal is always to make every affair fun , even if it happens to be a funeral , which he has orchestrated . <p> " Actually she went out a lot more stylishly than when she came in , " he is fond of saying about the client who no longer calls . " We draped the coffin , and had two huge arrangements of purple tulips and those dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles . And then we did a very high tea , with marble cake and port . It was lovely . " <p> So what 's his advice for the rest of us still living on a budget ? " You 've got to work with what you 've got . It only costs $ 5 for a dimmer switch , and candles cost virtually nothing . " <p> Elegance made easy Colin Cowie 's short cuts to easier elegant entertaining : <p> - Keep it simple . <p> - Chosse a menu you 're comfortable with . Do n't overdo . <p> - Serve the main course right away . Come back with salad , dessert . The evening is more relaxed . <p> - Candles . Lots of candles . <p> - Play music throughout the evening . <p> - Be involved with guests , Invest time in them .
