<p> The sound of the 1997 Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art is the sound of a television in the next room . <p> The galleries are stocked with cables , little red on-lights , laserdisc projectors  --  audio-visual machines that are n't particularly beautiful , or particularly high-tech , and will soon be obsolete . They hum and whir and click . The style that prevails is mechanico-theatrical . The characteristic scale is that of the loft , the store window , the sound stage . <p> Coming as it mostly does from New York and Los Angeles , the show is chic and brash . But it is n't Jeff Koons cynical , or in-your-face political , or wanly theoretical . What 's notable in the ' 97 Biennial is the poignancy of its art . <p> The survey 's a sort of storybook , a compendium of narratives . Its tales tug the viewer to dreamland , back to childhood , to the secret cave , the beach , the cabin in the hills . Remember pawing through the toy box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window screen , the seashells in the sand , and the slow drift of the stars ? Every picture tells a story , do n't it ? Here , the answer 's yes . <p> The ' 93 Biennial hectored , the ' 95 Biennial dithered . The ' 97 version  --  curated by Lisa Phillips and Louise Neri  --  is the most humane in years , in spite of all its hardware . <p> You want to know what 's new in art  --  at least in that small realm of art known as " advanced practice " in Manhattan and L.A. ? Faces are back , that 's what 's new . <p> " It is impossible today to paint a face , " the critic Clement Greenberg told Willem de Kooning in the 1950s , but the abstraction Greenberg championed , once central to the New York scene , no longer finds much favor . Here , instead , the ruling theme is : memories retrieved . <p> Gentleness is back as well . New art , so this show suggests , does n't have to shock ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to baffle ( in that snooty David Salle puzzle-picture way ) . In 1997 , art is once again allowed to reassure . <p> Unless you yearn to see great paintings . Vija Celmins , one of the few painters who made the cut in 1997 , once said that she retained " great faith in people painting forever , " but here she 's much outnumbered . Installations  --  transitory , vast , soon to be unplugged , difficult to sell  --  fill the Whitney 's galleries . Flat paintings may still rule the richest New York salesrooms , and the grandest art museums , but this is not a painting show , has n't been for years . <p> Some 1997 Biennial statistics : <p> Number of studios visited by the exhibition 's organizers ( Phillips , a curator at the museum , and Neri , the Australia-raised U.S. editor of the art journal Parkett ) : nearly 500 . Number of artists selected : 70 . New Yorkers among them : 41 . Angelenos : 15 . <p> Number of photographs displayed : more than 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projectors ( video , film , slide , laserdisc ) deployed : 17 . Television monitors : 15 . Pairs of earphones : 37 . Hours of film and video : 12 . <p> Likely to be remembered as the exhibition 's stars : influential multimedia artist Bruce Nauman ; influential sculptor Louise Bourgeois ; painters Kerry James Marshall , Sue Williams , Lari Pittman and Celmins ; sculptors Chris Burden , Jason Rhoades , Glen Seator and Jennifer Pastor ; and photographers Philip-Lorca diCorcia and John Schabel . <p> ( Cecilia Vicuna , who 's hung a net from the ceiling ; Sharon Lockhart , who makes dull photographs ; and Annette Lawrence , who makes spiral jottings , are as likely to be forgotten . ) <p> Nauman is represented by " End of the World , " a video much less scary than most of his ; it 's a three-projector piece in which the Appalachian fiddle tune is variously repeated  --  on dobro , pedal steel and slide guitar  --  until it weaves a kind of elegy , part hymn , part Texas two-step , part Scotch-Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grande dame of New York 's body-conscious feminist sculptors . As her newest straining figures show , she 's still working at full stretch . <p> Imagine a model-train layout with little bridges , little buildings , little cliffs and little trees  --  and imagine it expanded , exuberantly , obsessively , until it seems intent on swallowing the planet . Burden 's " Pizza City " is that sort of sprawling world . <p> Sculptor Seator made the tilted room : His piece is a life-size reconstruction of the Whitney director 's office , still carpeted and book-shelved , but balanced on edge . Jennifer Pastor made the seashells , and , with admirable fastidiousness , the big furry moth . Celmins paints the comets and the stars of the night sky . <p> This year 's Whitney show , the 69th , will be the last of the millenni um ( they 're skipping 1999 and a special edition will be mounted in spring 2000 ) . That this exhibit is the century 's last sets one wondering : Which artists matter most , what ideas have slipped from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bourgeois , as well as the late Eva Hesse and Edward Kienholz , seem to loom behind the art on view as pioneers , exemplars . " Treatment With Memories , " Ilya Kabakov 's stagy re-creation of a Soviet state hospital , is a lot like a Kienholz , though gentler by far , and much less succinct . And , curiously indeed , the spirit of Walt Disney also casts a happy shadow on the show . <p> It should be clear by now that you ca n't tell the complete story of 20th-century American art while stiffing Norman Rockwell and leaving out Disney , though most museums try . The artists at the Whitney are in many ways more tolerant . They bow to Walt in various ways  --  in the artificiality of their installations , in their cartoony markings , their sugary view of nature and in their deep reliance on technology and toys . <p> Tony Oursler 's portraits  --  his blinking , full-face videos projected on plastic eggs  --  resemble Disneyland 's more than they do Gilbert Stuart 's . Pastor 's giant shells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of making grown-ups feel like kids . The bluebirds flitting through Marshall 's fine , sad-nostalgic paintings are Disneyesque as well . <p> But while theatricalism is in , pure abstraction is out . The whole Pollock-Newman-Stella line of abstract field painting  --  which used to be a way of communing with the void  --  is n't much respected here . When it shows up it gets tweaked . <p> Williams ribs the genre by filling up her fields with high heels and spread thighs ; the cartoony line she uses in " Large Blue Gold and Itchy " ( 1996 ) is nearly as whippy as de Kooning 's . Pittman fills up his with skateboards , radio telescopes and garish L.A. colors , oranges and pinks . Rhoades , whose fields are three-dimensional , has filled the one on view , a zany and enormous piece , with orange cables , rag rugs , clay-pigeon flingers , ladders , hot dogs , table saws , pork and beans , and smoke  --  all as intricately interwoven as Jackson Pollock 's drips . Michael Ashkin 's sand table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toylike reproduction of an arid stretch of desert with a tiny blacktop highway ( and just as tiny trucks ) cutting it in two like one of Newman 's " zips . " <p> Avant-garde artists once forged forward . The Whitney 's seem content recalling what they felt as kids . <p> Though abstract art is spurned , another old convention  --  that of street photography  --  is treated deferentially , most admirably by diCorcia . He , too , captures strangers passing in the street , but he does so with a " flash trap , " and with color , in a way that gives his Ektachromes a kind of otherworldly drama . Though his street shots pay due homage to the Paul Strand-Andre Kertesz-Robert Frank tradition , they still manage to seem new . <p> Schabel is as indebted to the example of Walker Evans . It 's been nearly 60 years since Evans began to ride the New York subways , candidly recording the empty faces of the passengers with a little camera concealed in his coat . Schabel shoots through airplane windows using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions , half-alarmed and half-resigned , of people taking off . <p> Once upon a time the planners of these surveys saw it as their duty to reprise last season 's hits . Not any more . This is n't gallery art . Much of it is unsalable , or nearly so . It is n't home art , either , for rare is the art collector who has the room to show it , unless he takes the plunge and gives away his bed . It is something else . The 1997 Biennial Exhibition is mostly given over to contemporary art made for institutions that theatrically display contemporary art . <p> The exhibition , sponsored by Beck 's brewery , closes June 1 .
