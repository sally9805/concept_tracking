Section : FICTION There are perils in life so disturbing that we need to hold ourselves in a state of readiness , ever alert to exercise our sense of outrage or disbelief . Yet even these events must be dealt with and understood . Worse than the events themselves may be how the world responds to them . Consider the following . <p> Jason W. Plover , a poet with six books , was killed when a pig tumbled out of the sky and crushed him as he was crossing Massachusetts Avenue against the light at Harvard Square . <p> The pig was a seven-hundred-pound boar being used in a film about a bank robbery . A helicopter had been transporting it from a farm in Lexington to Memorial Drive along the banks of the Charles River , where a famous actress was waiting , as well as a Brinks truck rented for the afternoon . It was a key scene involving the use of the pig as a porcine roadblock . The pig had been doped , but not enough . It woke , saw daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter , breaking its bonds , and took a fatal step , a six-hundred-foot step with Jason W. Plover as its destination . <p> No telling what the pig thought . Its mind was probably a mass of question marks . It was early September , and trees were beginning to turn color . The sky was blue , the weather mild , and the view must have been marvelous . An idea having to do with a possible mistake was perhaps being assembled in the pig 's dim brain when it squashed Jason Plover into a splop of jelly . <p> One of the witnesses spoke of hearing a squeal . Another described a pig on a man 's shoulders . A third spoke of seeing an angel failing out of the air . People paused , looked up , and saw what appeared to be a pink cloud dropping fast . Much was made of the fact that Jason Plover had been crossing against the light , that he had not waited . He had been on his way to a lunch meeting at the Harvest with his editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in manuscript , and he was eager to rush it into print . Jason Plover was always in a hurry . Had he been a tad less serious , a tad more casual , he might be with us still today . <p> But seriousness had amounted to Jason Plover 's trademark . He had been a tall , heavyset man fond of wearing a thick tweed overcoat that made his figure resemble a rolled-up mattress . When he walked he liked to set his entire foot fiat upon the ground before lifting it for the next step . His heavy tread was well known in the halls of the English Department at Tufts , where he had taught for fifteen years . He had had vast and subtle black eyebrows , which he could wield as a samurai wields his sword . One position showed scorn , another superiority , and a third deep thought . There are many writers in the Boston area . Toss a stone in a public place and you are likely to hit one . But for seriousness  --  sheer , bullying , heavy-lidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat . <p> Now all was changed . <p> The headline in the Boston Herald read : " Plummeting Porker Pulverizes Poet . " <p> In the same way Jason Plover had taken liberties with the truth when alive , so had the headline writer at the Herald taken liberties with the truth in announcing Plover 's death . He was n't pulverized , he was squashed . <p> No matter . <p> Plover had had a wife : Harriet Spense , who was an associate professor of Feminist Studies at Tufts . She too had a deep seriousness , but , lacking her husband 's physical mass , her seriousness was qualified by the difference in their weights . Additionally , she had a certain lightness of soul and imagined herself someone who could take a joke . She was an attractive forty-year-old woman : tall and statuesque with dark red hair . <p> She first had a glimmer of the changes that lay before her when she entered the faculty room at Tufts the day after her husband 's death . She assumed one of her colleagues was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were laughing with an abandon she had never before witnessed within these walls . Harriet Spense loved her husband and grieved for his death . Yet she also looked forward to whatever might distract her from the awfulness of his passing , meaning that she hoped to share in the joke . However , when her colleagues caught sight of her , they clamped their mouths shut , turned away , and began to make coughing and choking noises , as if it were not something amusing but acrid smoke that was responsible for their condition . Although suspicious , Harriet did n't quite catch on . <p> Then at the funeral home , as she spoke to the director , whose face was bright red and who kept gasping , she found herself distracted by chuckling from a farther room , as if embalming and corpse preparation had charms the nature of which had so far escaped her . At the church , the minister would n't meet her eye , and again she heard distant laughter , as if the church workers found extraordinary delight in their daily tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully recounted : strange phone calls , the attentiveness of the press , people staring at her on the street , neighbors behaving with inappropriate heartiness . Actually , it was at the funeral that all became clear , and Harriet caught an unpleasant glimpse of her future . There were a lot of television cameras . The Episcopal service was quite serious , yet all through it were sudden hoots and guffaws . Sitting in the front row with her two embarrassed sons , Harriet Spense realized that the oddity of her husband 's death might wipe out the accomplishments of his life . It is hard for six serious books of poetry , with a seventh on the way , to compete with the burden of being killed by a falling pig . Put the seven books on one end of a teeter-totter and the pig on the other and there is no contest . We read in history that the Greek poet Aeschylus was killed when a turtle dropped by a passing eagle struck his head and split his skull . Aeschylus 's reputation has long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furtive laughter . It was wartime , and people needed a joke . <p> Jason Plover was now the poet who had been killed by a falling pig . His books immediately disappeared from the stores , and new printings were planned . Years earlier he had written a poem entitled " The Pig and I , " which had appeared in his second collection : Household Mysteries . It was not a great poem , but it detailed those differences in thought , generosity , and humanity that separate men and women from pigs . A human being cares about his or her brothers and sisters ; a pig does not  --  this was the poem 's theme . Pigs are crass , self-centered , greedy , and they eat their young . It was astonishing to Harriet Spense how many requests she had over the next few months to anthologize this poem . It was as if Jason Plover 's death were an example of how the animal kingdom can strike back ; as if the failing pig had been on a revengeful kamikaze raid . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly other poets , to write a biographical note detailing the manner of Plover 's death . In this they had a lot of fun . <p> Plover had been a moderately well-known poet , and it was not uncommon for literary magazines to ask him for work . Now Harriet was swamped with requests . Her husband had had about thirty unpublished poems that he intended to include in his seventh volume . These poems were actually fought over ; editors called Harriet Spense day and night . Many said they would be happy to publish material that had already appeared in other magazines . These were magazines with circulations between five hundred and five thousand . With Plover 's name on the cover , their sales would triple . <p> The editor of a famous poetry magazine in the Midwest was particularly insistent . Some years before he had given up publishing poems for their own sake and had devoted himself to theme issues , which gave all the work in his magazine a decorative cast and let poets feel that their work was being rejected because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " Cemeteries " or " Home Owning " or " Buying a Dog . " The fact that this approach to poetry trivialized the medium appeared to be part of the point . This editor called Harriet Spense a dozen times . He was planning a " Pig " issue , and it would n't be complete without a poem by Jason Plover . In vain did Harriet tell this man that her husband had no other poems about pigs . " Any kind of poem will do , " said the editor . Not even its quality was important . He would even take an unfinished poem in an early draft , even rough notes , mere jottings . What was important was the theme , and he could not possibly have a " Pig " issue without a poem by Jason W. Plover . The editor would even pay double the rates , and he was angry when Harriet refused to send him anything . He seemed to think she was attributing a seriousness to poetry that his theme issues were hoping to deny . <p> Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband transformed into a figure of fun , but she too became amusing because she had been married to him . There was a facial expression that Harriet came to recognize as the **59;194;TOOLONG expression . People would try to be sympathetic , yet giggle at the same time . They would cover their mouths and look away , and their eyes would water . Because her husband had really been killed , and because people like to imagine they possess some shred of decency , very few made jokes to her face , yet when they saw her coming they were clearly prepared to be amused . Even the most serious of us seek out chances to partake of the long slide into laughter . There is a sweetness to that wonderful forgetting that makes us crave it . Had Jason Plover been a plumber or a postman , the humor would not have been so great . But being a poet with a deep seriousness , he was especially vulnerable . <p> Jason Plover had had a characteristic gesture . He would join his thumb to the fingertips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five digits about an inch toward the palm , pause , then shoot them forward as he opened his hand wide , duplicating , as it were , a miniature explosion . It was a dismissive gesture . Something small and inconsequential was being blown away . He would make this gesture at the end of summing up another poet 's work or when discussing an inferior poem . He would make it after discussing another writer 's intellect or chance of true success . It was a summing-up sort of gesture . No telling who made it first after Jason Plover had been squashed by the falling pig , but soon Harriet Spense began noticing it all over Cambridge . And she came to understand that the gesture  --  the little outward puff of fingers  --  now referred to Jason Plover himself : events had conspired to blow him away . <p> Harriet 's sons were deeply depressed . Frank was a junior at Boston University . Charles was a senior at Harvard . Three weeks after their father 's death they dropped out of school . They spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . They regretted that their name  --  Plover  --  was sufficiently unusual to remind people about that poet  --  their father-who had been squashed by a falling pig . They discussed new names : Jacobs and Wellerby and McBride . They were intelligent young men who had had a clear sense of a bright future . Now they felt their lives were over unless they changed their names and moved to another part of the country . They needed something like the FBI 's witness protection program . Harriet tried to dissuade them , but in her heart she knew they were right . Her own teaching had suffered immeasurably from the particulars of her husband 's death . For one thing , strangers began sitting in on her classes . There was always a whispering , and once she heard an " oink-oink " from the back of the room . <p> " Perhaps you should take a leave , " her chairman told her . He was a tweedy , bearded man who liked to rub his stomach when he talked . <p> " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather , " said the chairman . " Think of being killed by a falling pig . " And the chairman covered his mouth with his hand . <p> " No , I do n't mean that , " said Harriet . " I mean people 's response to his death . " <p> " I would have given my left foot to have seen it , " said the chairman . " No offense intended . " <p> And so Harriet Spense took a leave . A psychiatrist friend wrote a letter saying that Harriet 's mental health would be seriously damaged if she continued to teach . The dean made no problems . Actually , when she sat waiting to see him , she heard gales of laughter from his office , and when several men came out , they refused to meet her eye . <p> Harriet had a fairly large amount of money from Jason 's publisher due to his increased sales and the rights to his poem " The Pig and I. " His new book was to be called Transcendent Moments in the Spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change the title to Pigging Out or Pork Thoughts . Harriet refused , even though Josie said it could mean an extra ten thousand dollars . " To think , " said Josie , " I was so close . I would have given anything to see it happen . It must have been absolutely celestial . " <p> One night in late October while Harriet was boxing up Jason 's clothes to give to the Tufts Impoverished Students ' Fund , she thought : " I 'm sick of Jason 's poetry . I 'm sick of the life we had together . " Then she glanced around guiltily , as if afraid her thoughts had been overheard . <p> Harriet had never until now questioned her life with Jason . Her husband had been a highly respected poet , and she was a highly respected feminist thinker whose two books were used in classes at more than thirty colleges and universities across the country . They had often been invited out to dinner and were much in demand for the quality of their conversation . Jason Plover 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a value that was almost monetary . It paid for a lot of meals . When Jason 's opinion was asked , the other guests fell silent . Jason would rub his jaw , manipulate his black eyebrows , and enter his sentence much in the way an icebreaker enters a frozen sea . He had liked to make harrumphing noises and to clear his throat . He liked to make that little exploding gesture with the fingers of his left hand . And while Harriet 's own ego was not so tied up in her conversational abilities , she too liked being someone to whom other people listened . <p> This too had changed . People now listened to her because her husband had been killed in a ridiculous manner . She could have said nothing but " Doo , dah , doo , dah , " and her listeners would have been pleased . She could have done no more than whistle . And if she had grunted like a pig , oh , how happy people would have been . <p> As a result Harriet Spense came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been the content of her speech that people valued ? Was it not her serious manner , and her husband 's even more serious manner ? Was it not to their curriculum vitae , rather than their voices , that people listened ? And now her vita was radically altered . She had a sense of the shallowness of her Cambridge life and the superficiality of what she had valued . She saw that the deep seriousness with which her life had been swaddled was simply a buffer . It had existed to keep people at a distance . It indicated she had a certain importance and needed to be treated with respect . It had been the strangler of spontaneity and impulse . It had rigidified her life as if she had been dipped in concrete . These realizations caused her a chagrin that was even greater than the embarrassment she had felt because of how Jason had died . Indeed , she now saw that the manner of her husband 's death was almost fortunate because it revealed the lie she had been living . She had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw that his final gift to her had been the absurdity of his death , because it opened to her a new life , a new way of living . <p> So it was that seven weeks after her husband 's death Harriet closed up her house in Cambridge and moved to Ann Arbor . Her two sons had already disappeared , and she knew of them only by brief postcards from California signed Magillicuddy . Harriet 's undergraduate degree had been in clinical psychology , and she got a job at a hospice . She was drawn to the idea of people dying in bed surrounded by others who loved them , or at least who had deep respect for them as human beings and for the whole experience of death . For her , death had become a joke , a dreadful buffo , and she needed to make it big again . <p> " The process of dying , " Harriet told a cancer patient , " is a process that begins with birth . It continues while we occupy ourselves with what is important in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our death accompanies us all through our years , gradually taking our place until it exchanges itself for us completely . The event which will soon occur in your life has been preparing itself for every moment of your life . " <p> But mostly she did n't counsel anybody , mostly she helped with small embarrassing chores like bandages and bedpans , and she liked to read to people : she would read Dickens and Thackeray and Tolstoy , great long books that gave to the dying the sense that enormous expanses of time stretched before them . <p> Each day she would have conversations with the men and women she thought of as her patients . The elderly especially had had long and interesting lives . They had traveled and witnessed events that Harriet had only read about . " I did n't know Lawrence of Arabia personally , " said one old man , " but I often saw him from afar when I was in Damascus . " <p> " I was a freshman at Clark when Freud presented his lectures , " said an ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a very pointed head . " <p> There was something about these stories that made time seem causal , and Harriet realized she was attempting to repair her sense of causality . Her husband 's death appeared to lie outside causality . The malignant demiurge who hangs life 's carrot before our eyes had been having his or her little joke . What do we do with an extremely serious poet ? We kill him with a failing pig . Those people who had laughed at the manner of her husband 's death  --  should n't they have been terrified ? Did n't Jason 's death indicate some awful truth about the cosmos  --  that if it has a divine direction , then its prime mover is whimsy ? <p> There was a doctor who often came to the hospice who was about Harriet 's age . His name was Robert Chase . He was a tall , willowy figure with a mop of graying blond hair . He never stood completely straight but kept shifting as if the wind were tugging him this way and that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white coat and look at Harriet with his deep blue eyes . <p> " Do you ever read poetry ? " Harriet asked him one day in the staff lounge . <p> " Absolutely not , " said Robert . " Did you hear about that poet in Boston who got killed by a falling pig ? " <p> " I read something about it , " said Harriet . <p> " You wonder how many times something like that misses us . You know , the truck that would have run us down if we had been just a little faster . " <p> " He had crossed against the light , " said Harriet . <p> " Probably one of those stress-ridden Type-A personalities , " said Robert . " I wonder what he did to relax . " <p> Harriet nearly said that Jason had collected first editions and had been her husband , but instead she closed her mouth and shrugged . " Whatever it was , " she said at last , " it was n't enough . " <p> After a few of these conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a small Italian restaurant on the road to Ypsilanti . Robert kept looking at her , not out of curiosity or as if expecting anything from her , but just to rest his eyes upon her . <p> " I think people try to make their lives too serious , " said Harriet as they shared a medium-sized antipasto . <p> " Is that why you work at the hospice ? " Robert wore a dark-blue denim shirt and a bright yellow tie . Harriet liked how undoctorly he appeared . <p> " I think I work there in order to see just how serious life can be . If you stare long enough at the most serious thing that life has in store for us , " said Harriet , " then perhaps you can come out on the other side . " <p> " You mean on the side of laughter ? " <p> " Why not ? " asked Harriet . " I mean , I do n't intend to laugh at the people at the hospice . My job is to help them and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what damage does such solemnity do to me ? So I look at it and study it , and perhaps with time I 'll grow accustomed to it . " <p> " Do you think that seriousness is connected to fear ? " asked Robert . The tablecloth was a red-and-black cotton checkerboard . Robert kept moving the salt and pepper shakers from square to square as he listened . <p> " I expect it 's influenced by fear , " said Harriet . She thought of her husband 's seriousness , how it was like one of the garments he wore . Most often his laughter had been ironic or sarcastic or superior . His laughter had been judgmental , and , as a result , all his laughter had been serious . Was it possible to laugh without any element of judgment ? Jason Plover 's life had been an edifice that he had built to demonstrate the solemnity of his endeavor . Poor Jason , killed by a falling pig ; his death had overturned the premises of his life . <p> " Seriousness , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show other people . We want others to think us serious , which suggests a fear of not being taken seriously . What does that seriousness get us ? It neither delays our death nor makes it easier to bear . " <p> " And what is the opposite of seriousness ? Frivolity ? " <p> " Most literally perhaps , but I think the opposite of such a seriousness is love , because love accepts all possibilities , whereas seriousness only accepts what it sees as correct . Perhaps I work at the hospice for purely selfish reasons . I work to improve the quality of my love . " <p> " That seems pretty serious , " said Robert . <p> " I 'm not against seriousness , " said Harriet . " I simply want to go beyond it . I want it to be an element in my life and not its reason for being . Look at the unexpected changes that life can force upon a person . Surely life 's intrinsic definition , that is , constant change , argues against rigidity . Seriousness may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and just brush it aside . " <p> " And how can it do that ? " <p> " It can drop a pig on your head from a great height . " <p> Harriet Spense saw Robert more and more often , and she came to realize that they would probably begin a romance . This made her happy . She did n't tell him about Jason ; she did n't want to muddy the romantic water . She knew she would tell him sooner or later , but she was n't afraid of doing so . She also knew that she would eventually leave the hospice and return to teaching . <p> There was an old man at the hospice named Franklin , who had long ago been a high school principal in Bloom field Hills . Now he was ninety-five and had been retired for thirty years . Harriet read to him from Bleak House , and was even nearing the end of the book . One afternoon in spring , she asked him , " What is the funniest thing you can think of ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window . It was a sunny day , and the cherry trees behind the hospice were in full flower . <p> Franklin 's gray and spotted hands lay on the counterpane and trembled as if they were getting ready to start up and go someplace . <p> " The funniest recent thing I can think of , " said Franklin , " was something I read about last fall . A fellow was walking across the street in Boston and a pig fell out of the air and crushed him . It had fallen out of a passing helicopter . The man never knew what hit him . He was a poet , I forget his name . He was hurrying someplace important , and this seven-hundred-pound pig fell on top of him . It dropped like a rock and hit him right on the noggin . I do n't know , it 's probably not funny , but it tickles me . I mean , I got to die here in this darn bed . Why could n't I have been killed by a pig falling out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be famous forever . This poet , what an opportunity ! Some people have all the luck . " <p> Harriet Spense considered how Franklin yearned for the fame that had resulted in her husband 's ultimate trivialization . She found herself laughing . She put her hands on her knees , leaned back her head and gasped for breath . It was neither a guffaw nor the hysterical shriek of nervousness . It was the laugh of someone whose seriousness has been overthrown , the laugh that erases all other concerns . Our plans , our memories , our fears are all replaced by a peculiar yet distinctive hooting . To some it sounds like a mob of crows , to others a donkey 's bray . In fact , it is the sound of the world disappearing as all the content is sucked from our heads , to be replaced  --  briefly , oh , too briefly  --  by a happy vacancy . And does n't this sustain us ? Does n't it provide the strength to let us bear up our burden and continue our mortal journey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
