<p> He does not love the bad weather , really , because of the hurt it can bring , but he does love the battle . Ask 65-year-old George Winterling about the hurricanes he has forecast and reported on as the senior television meteorologist in Jacksonville , Fla. , and he almost sighs . <p> " Dora , the one and only full force in our history , 1964 . I tracked Betsy in 1965 . Threatened Miami but skirted the Keys and hit New Orleans . Then Camille in 1969 . Hit the Mississippi coast , brought floods that killed 100 in Virginia . Not many people know that . Agnes in 1972 , barely a hurricane , but did flood Pennsylvania and New York . Lesser ones . Then in 1985 , six crossed the coastline . Gloria . Then Hugo in 1989 , missed Jacksonville and hit South Carolina , dropped 11 inches of rain . Flooding took two lives in downtown Jacksonville . Then , in 1992 , there was Andrew . " The most recent hurricane , Erika , was not worth mentioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season reached its halfway point on Friday . <p> Mr. Winterling , who studied meteorology in the Air Force and used to work for the National Weather Service , knows his town so well he can predict which streets will flood under specific amounts of rain . He dates back to an era when forecasters used Magic Markers on wall maps , yet he was a pioneer . He was one of the first to use film in a weather segment , to show floods or trees on houses  --  he bought a 16-millimeter camera from a pawn shop and shot the film himself . <p> Replacing him , when he retires , will be difficult , not just because of his expertise but because of all the other things he brings to his market  --  things like trust and broad recognition  --  in a Southern city where weather is often dangerous , and almost personal . <p> In such places , television stations swamped with resumes from news , feature and sports reporters often have to go looking for good , experienced meteorologists , for someone who can be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Nielsen sweepstakes , so crucial to the profitability of local stations , drives them to focus on news that is either sensational or personal . In the South  --  on the Florida coast , the North Carolina beaches , the Gulf of Mexico  --  the weather is both , making forecasters a link both to profits and people 's lives . <p> And it is helpful , in a city where the weather is so dangerous , if a meteorologist is also spoiling for a fight . <p> Mr. Winterling 's station , WJXT-TV , spelled out plainly what it was looking for in a meteorologist in a recent advertisement in Broadcasting and Cable magazine : <p> " Dominant Southeast mid-sized market network affiliate in the middle of hurricane country looking for a meteorologist  --  active , aggressive and personable . Candidates must have AMS ( American Meteorological Society ) seal and be very familiar and at ease with the latest technology . We want applicants who understand the importance of community involvement and want to find a permanent home . We are looking to our future and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills and patience to eventually become our chief . Please send resume . . . " <p> There is a similar ad in the magazine almost every week . <p> But the need for such forecasters is not limited to hurricane country . In north Texas , where George Flickinger forecasts the weather for KTXS-TV in Abilene , the weather is as mean as a two-headed snake . <p> Killer thunderstorms form out of the clear , blue nothingness . Winds reach 70 miles an hour  --  one famous gust was clocked at more than 80  --  and hail the size of tennis balls sends people scrambling for cover . <p> The area around Abilene , Tex. , is one of several places nationwide where people live in a " tornado alley , " a place on the map where the mix of seasonal weather conditions gives birth to storms that will ruin a landscape . It is routine to hear a meteorologist break into programming with a warning , giving people precious moments to find shelter . <p> Mr. Flickinger , a morning meteorologist , would not have it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue sky . <p> " My car has been damaged three times by hail , " he says , proudly . <p> Toss in an occasional blue norther , to freeze the ducks on the pond , and north Texas must surely rank as one of America 's most unpredictable and dangerous areas for weather . He loves it . <p> " We crave the severe weather , " Mr. Flickinger said . " The sun is shining , so today is a boring day . When there is hail , we go , ' Yes , we have hail ! ' " <p> But he is also a Texan , from near Beaumont , and he realizes that a vital part of his job has less to do with science than with schmoozing . He talks to kindergarten classrooms and to civic groups . Even in places where the weather is serious , the meteorologist is often an odd mix of scientist and celebrity , someone who not only warns people of dangers but judges beauty contests and rides in the Christmas parade . <p> " It 's the funnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in his first job as a meteorologist . <p> " They need us , " he said of the viewers , " because the weather out here can kill you . " But getting a degree in meteorology , say forecasters and their bosses , is just the beginning . Even in the techno-language of Doppler-this or Stormtracker-that , forecasters must also be willing to hold up for the camera a T-shirt given to them by an elementary school . <p> Because , as news directors point out , it is not enough to simply show complicated graphics and computer-enhanced images . The viewers must like , and trust , a person who brings that message . It can translate into good community relations , and good ratings . <p> " It 's not a Magic Marker and a map any more , " said Mike Stutz , the news director at WJXT-TV in Jacksonville , Mr. Winterling 's station . <p> That station , like a professional football team searching for a young quarterback to study under an aging one , is looking to the future . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some pretty good computer skills , " said Mr. Stutz , but also must be someone who " can keep that two to three minutes interesting as well . All our research shows it is one of the most important , if not the most important , " parts of the news . <p> More than ever , people understand the weather now , said Paul Brown , news director at KTXS in Abilene ; they understand how radar and other equipment is used to track dangerous weather , " and they expect a lot more from the person using it . " <p> All this comes as the National Weather Service cuts personnel and , some fear , its effectiveness . <p> " It takes on new meaning , " Mr. Brown said . A nearby Weather Service radar station was recently dismantled , leaving his station 's Doppler system  --  sophisticated radar that allows a meteorologist to gauge wind speed and the storm 's severity and perhaps predict its path  --  as the only one left for people in the immediate area . <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important what they 're doing , " said Mr. Brown of the meteorologists who have to be able to understand such systems . <p> While there are sufficient numbers of qualified people to meet demands  --  if there were not , smaller stations would have to pay more than the $20,000 to $40,000 that is the going rate for less-experienced meteorologists  --  it is harder to find someone who can also become a cog in the community . <p> " People form a friendship " with such forecasters , said Antoinette Pellegrino , manager of classified ads and telemarketing at Broadcasting and Cable , and the meteorologist becomes " a personality . " <p> After graduating from Texas A &; M with degrees in broadcast journalism and meteorology , Mr. Flickinger had three offers from Southern stations , all searching for trained meteorologists . He even turned down a hometown station in Beaumont to take the job in Abilene , because the weather is more vital to the newscast at KTXS . Abilene , with 100,000 people , has three television stations . <p> " If a reporter 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Brown said . But the choices for meteorologist are skimpier , though that is already changing . <p> More and more people are beginning to see it as their way into the broadcasting and cable businesses , say veteran meteorologists and station managers ; schools like Texas A &; M and the University of Mississippi offer degrees in meteorology . <p> Out of college , one of the best ways to advance in that arena is to tackle a city with tough weather problems , like Abilene , even if the viewing area is small compared with a major market . <p> " We have more computer stuff than in the stations in Dallas , " Mr. Flickinger said . Big stations want people who have been through a boot camp , of sorts , of bad weather . <p> As much as anyone , perhaps , Mr. Winterling knows what it takes to be a complete forecaster , and one of those things appears to be humility . <p> Mr. Winterling , twice a week , does a stand-up from his garden , where he talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , the weather . <p> Sometimes , he misses the days of the Magic Marker and the big paper map . <p> " People said their children were learning how to write , watching " him draw in the weather , he said . <p> " Lots of people now are trying to make their weathercasts too sophisticated , " he said . It is why he does a forecast from his garden  --  " Tomorrow , I 'll show them how to plant broccoli and cabbage "  --  and why he never minds going to a kindergarten . <p> Sometimes , even with all his experience , he is stumped a little there . One little boy asked him a question he had never been asked . <p> " What happens , " the little boy asked , " when two hurricanes come together ? " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : September 22 , 1997 , Monday <p> CORRECTION : A chart in Business Day last Monday about Southern hurricanes misstated the deadliest such storm of the century .
