Danny Roman , a hostage negotiator for the Chicago police ( Samuel L. Jackson ) , is falsely accused of corruption and murder . He becomes a hostage taker , hoping to put pressure on his bosses to clear his name . He 'll talk only with his one equal in this dangerous line of work , Chris Sabian ( Kevin Spacey ) . Two strong actors in a strong situation : a recipe for a taut , tense , smart movie . And for a while The Negotiator is just that , with a genuinely puzzling mystery built in ( if Roman is n't the killer , who is ? ) . But Hollywood does n't trust talk , particularly in summer . So eventually the running around and explosions commence . As usual , the main things lost in the hubbub are wit and logic . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
