<p> After more than a decade of soaring gains , Bay Area corporate executives enjoyed only modest increases in salaries , bonuses and other nonoption compensation last year . <p> Their stock options , however , proved more lucrative than ever . <p> The region 's leading executives enjoyed huge profits by exercising options  --  thanks to the runaway bull market . They also received unusually generous new option grants that promise fat profits over the next decade . <p> In its 13th annual executive compensation survey , The Chronicle looked at the pay packages of 266 of the highest-ranking executives at 50 of the Bay Area 's largest companies . <p> Among the key findings : <p> * The group 's median nonoption compensation amounted to $ 684,700 in fiscal 1996 . While that is a hefty sum , it is only 1.7 percent greater than the median pay received by the same executives the year before . <p> * Although the gain was modest overall , individual changes in nonoption pay varied all over the lot . Several executives endured pay cuts greater than 20 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no discernible correlation between these changes and what experts consider the most important measure of a company 's success : the return to shareholders . <p> * Companies granted new stock options to 116 executives , and the median estimated value of these grants came to $ 1,294,200 . That is more than twice the median value of option grants in the previous year 's survey . <p> * Nearly half the group  --  130 executives  --  exercised at least some of their stock options during the year , pocketing a median profit of $ 1,543,700 . That was 66 percent more than the previous year 's median profit . <p> The flattening of nonoption pay and the jump in option grants reflect corporate America 's growing emphasis on what compensation consultants call " pay for performance . " Consultants , institutional investors and media commentators have been pushing this concept hard over the past decade . <p> THE COMMITTEES <p> Corporate compensation committees  --  consisting of outside directors who work with consultants to determine the appropriate pay for executives  --  have gradually adopted the concept . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , return on equity , operating margins and gains ( or losses ) in the company 's stock price . They also monitor pay practices at similar-sized companies in similar industries . <p> They attempt , with varying degrees of sincerity and success , to correlate these measures with an executive 's overall pay package . <p> Top executives of a publicly held company , the experts urge , should be bountifully rewarded if the shareholders do well , but not if the stock flops . Hence , more stock options . <p> CRITICS ARGUE <p> But most compensation critics also argue that if option pay goes up , nonoption pay should go down , rather than merely flattening . Otherwise , the options become so much gravy on an already full plate . <p> Few compensation committees have accepted that part of the equation . <p> Graef " Bud " Crystal , a widely respected former compensation consultant who publishes a gadfly newsletter out of San Diego , contends that compensation committees have become too open-handed with option grants  --  that the grants have rocketed " out of control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , " Crystal observes , " I had in mind a 3,000- square-foot house , where you convert a small bedroom to the performance room . But companies have called in a contractor and said : ' We want to build a 12,000-square-foot pay-for-performance wing . ' " <p> AN ENCOURAGING SIGN <p> Gary Hourihan , chairman of SCA Consulting , in Los Angeles , agrees that it is " hard to defend " increases in stock options when basic pay remains undiminished . <p> However , he points to one encouraging sign : A few Bay Area companies have started using a new , so-called high-threshold option that sets the exercise price higher , making it tougher for executives to reap profits . <p> With conventional stock options , an executive is granted the right to buy shares of the company 's stock , usually within a 10-year period , at the stock price on the day the option is granted . <p> The high-threshold options , by contrast , have their exercise prices set above the stock 's price on the day the option is granted  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , the stock could rise significantly before the option expires , but not enough to reach the exercise price , leaving the executive without a profit . <p> HIGH-THRESHOLD OPTIONS <p> This would certainly qualify as compensation reform if all other things remained equal . But in practice , they do n't . <p> Some companies that switched to the high-threshold options are granting vast numbers of them  --  far more than the number of conventional options they granted in the past , notes Marty Katz , chief compensation consultant with William M. Mercer Inc. in San Francisco . <p> The net result is that high- threshold option packages often turn out to be more valuable than conventional packages . <p> AN AIRTOUCH EXAMPLE <p> For example , AirTouch Communications started granting high- threshold options last year . Its top five executives got a total of 1,475,580 , with exercise prices ranging from $ 41.625 to $ 52.725 per share . <p> In 1995 , the top AirTouch executives got only 1,130,550 options , all of them conventional , with exercise prices ranging from $ 31.50 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AirTouch stock  --  recently selling below $ 30  --  will rise enough within 10 years to make the high- threshold options worth $ 57.8 million at expiration . The total estimated value of the conventional options was pegged at $ 50.2 million  --  13 percent less . <p> W.J. " Jerry " Sanders , chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices , the Sunnyvale chipmaker , got the most lucrative option package of all the executives in this year 's Chronicle survey . <p> Sanders , whose compensation consistently ranks him at or near the top in the Bay Area , received 2.5 million options , giving him the right to buy AMD stock at $ 14.75 per share  --  the market price at the time the options were granted . <p> AMD 'S SANDERS <p> The company originally estimated the value of Sanders ' grant at $ 23,190,490  --  but now that looks much too conservative . AMD stock has shot up to nearly $ 40 , making the options already worth at least $ 60 million on paper . <p> In its proxy statement , AMD explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help ensure that he will remain with the company . The options will become vested in stages over the next six years . <p> Sanders , a co-founder of AMD who has never publicly suggested that he might bolt , is " uniquely qualified to protect and enhance the best interests of the company , " AMD says . <p> While Sanders was receiving a ton of new options , his archrival Andy Grove , president and chief executive of Santa Clara-based Intel , was cashing in a ton of old ones . <p> AND NOW ANDY <p> Grove exercised options on 1,040,000 shares last year , netting him a profit of $ 94.6 million  --  almost certainly a record for a Bay Area executive in a single year . <p> Grove turned around and sold the bulk of the shares he acquired , keeping 200,000 shares for his charitable foundation and 80,000 shares for his private account , says Intel spokesman Howard High . <p> High says this should n't be taken as a sign that Intel 's CEO considers the company 's stock a " sell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 million at recent market prices . And at the end of last year he still held options on 660,000 shares , representing unrealized profits of $ 72.3 million . <p> Thanks to Intel 's consistently spectacular stock performance , Grove has almost invariably stood first among Bay Area executives ranked by the value of unexercised options . <p> MASSIVE OPTIONS <p> But in the wake of his massive options exercise last year , he was supplanted by Scott G. McNealy , chairman , president and chief executive of Sun Microsystems , the Mountain View workstation maker . At the end of the year , McNealy was sitting on unrealized options profits totaling $ 156.5 million . <p> McNealy also directly held 9.2 million Sun shares ( adjusted for a split ) at the end of the year , worth around $ 300 million at recent prices . <p> McNealy does n't want to talk about his holdings , even indirectly . " Executive compensation is a private matter , " a Sun spokeswoman declared . " We do n't want to get into conversations about it . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messmer Jr. , chairman and chief executive of Robert Half International , the Menlo Park employment agency . He received $ 10,311,600  --  the bulk of it in the form of an $ 8.8 million restricted- stock grant that vests after five years . <p> RESTRICTED STOCK <p> Restricted stock is , in effect , a gift from the directors . An executive gets to keep the stock at the end of the vesting period simply by remaining with the company . <p> It is a highly controversial form of compensation that seemed to be fading out a few years ago , under withering attacks from outside critics , but lately it has been making a comeback . <p> Matt Ward , chief executive of WestWard Pay Strategies in San Francisco , says the resurgence of restricted stock reflects the growing influence on the West Coast of consultants who have moved here from the East , where that form of compensation has always been more popular . <p> " Compensation committees are getting bad advice , " says Ward , who scorns restricted stock as " pay for attendance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it to retain executives whose services are vitally important . <p> MESSMER 'S LEADERSHIP <p> M. Keith Waddell , Robert Half 's chief financial officer , claims that company CEO Messmer fits that description . <p> He notes that under Messmer 's leadership , Robert Half ranked in the top 1 percent among New York Stock Exchange companies in return to shareholders for the three-year period ended last year . <p> Sixty-seven of the executives in The Chronicle 's survey  --  about a fourth  --  received restricted stock awards with a median value of $ 389,000 last year . That is up from just 40 awards with a median value of $ 288,000 the year before . <p> The top five executives of Scotts Valley-based Seagate Technology received restricted-stock grants totaling $ 23 million last year . All of them ranked among the top 13 Bay Area executives in nonoption compensation . <p> APPLE 'S CHIEF <p> Seagate explained in its proxy statement that the awards were granted in lieu of pension and retirement benefits . The company does n't provide such benefits to its executive officers , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Gilbert Amelio , chairman and chief executive of Cupertino- based Apple Computer , got a $ 3.8 million restricted-stock award last year that constituted more than half of his $ 6.8 million in nonoption pay . <p> Apple says Amelio , who became the beleaguered company 's CEO in February 1996 after the ouster of Michael H. Spindler , got the restricted stock for developing and implementing a long-term profit-improvement strategy . <p> In the short term , however , Apple has been battered with five consecutive quarters of big losses , and its stock is selling for only around half its value when Amelio took over . <p> Robert Half 's Messmer barely edged out Charles Schwab , chairman and chief executive of San Francisco discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. , for top nonoption compensation honors . <p> Schwab pulled down $ 10,206,000 in nonoption pay last year , thanks primarily to a $ 9.4 million cash bonus  --  probably the largest ever awarded to a Bay Area executive . <p> David S. Pottruck , Schwab 's president and chief operating officer , got a $ 6.4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7,150,000 . <p> Schwab says its top executives got those big bonuses because the company handily exceeded its financial targets last year . <p> " Schwab 's performance targets are extremely high , " insists company spokesman Tom Taggart . " We achieved 30 percent revenue growth and 36 percent earnings growth last year . We 're a high-growth business . " <p> TOP OPTION INCOME <p> . <p> Andrew S.
