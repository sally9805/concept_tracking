<p> Georgians know pecans , producing more than any other state . So it 's not surprising that travelers who used to drop by Presley 's Nut House north of Eatonton came looking for pecan pie . But Love Presley , who ran the business with her husband , David Leon Presley , for 15 years , was too busy to bake , what with all her shopkeeping duties . Instead , she sold them the pecans they sought , along with almonds , peanuts and her own pecan clusters . She also tossed in tips picked up in the " retirement " avocation : Freeze pecans to keep them fresh . Even if you thaw too many to use at one time , go ahead and refreeze them . Because they 're oil-based , it 's OK . Sprinkle almonds on any kind of salad to add a nice crunch . Scatter chopped peanuts on a bowl of soup . Lightly toast any nuts to bring out a richer flavor . <p> Listening to so many requests for pies and the like led Presley to publish " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of her own and others ' efforts , many calling for nuts . She sold it as a souvenir , sending her customers home with the book , some nuts and the potential to experiment on their own .

But just in case you are wondering about the difference among them , we9ve put together some key facts for the most popular holiday nuts . And yes , we know that peanuts are really a legume rather than a nut . But we included them anyway . <p> GENERAL TIPS Storing : Most nuts do well placed in a tightly sealed container and stored in the freezer for several months . Blanching , slicing and chopping tend to stimulate the chemical reaction that causes nuts to turn rancid , so they won9t keep as long . It9s generally a good idea to allow frozen nuts to defrost to room temperature before using . Toasting : Preheat oven to 300 degrees . Spread unshelled nuts in a single layer in a shallow pan . Bake , stirring often , 10-15 minutes , until nuts begin to turn brown . After removing from the oven , residual heat will continue to toast them slightly .
