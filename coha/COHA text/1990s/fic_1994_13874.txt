SCENE : Ancestor 's Books &amp; Breakfast . Hundred of books are piled on the floor and scattered all around the room . Oversized , brightly-colored books hang from the ceiling and set on the half-empty bookshelves . A cafe table for customers hosts brightly-decorated chairs . Afrocentric posters of Africa and African-American heroes decorate the walls . AT RISE : MR . FINE is seen through the window giving a bunch of flowers to OZ along with elaborate instructions . Inside the cafe BAYBAY is wearing a glamorous ( leopard-print or satin ) bathrobe and a long blonde wig . She begins waltzing around the room enraptured in " movie music " ( theme music in the genre of epic films ) . After a few moments , she becomes depressed , leans on the counter in blue light watching a film the audience ca n't see . The window becomes a movie screen . She points to the screen and speaks . BAYBAY My life until today has been merely an audition for the real thing . ( Pause . ) When is it gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diva ? ( BAYBAY walks around the room talking to herself , but someone is listening . She sips on a diet soda as she occasionally puts books in empty boxes . She answers unseen voices . ) Say what ? What 's my problem ? I 'm thirty-five years oldOkay , so I 'm forty . How did I get here ? Where did I turn left when I should 've turned right ? I followed every direction in the book , and this is where ? This ca n't be my life ! Ca n't be . My life was supposed to have more meaning , go slower , bebe better than this . ( Angry . ) I 've given away almost every one of these goddamned books . I have poured my last cup of wisdom tea and stirred my last pot of backbone soup . Forty years is a long-ass wait .

Lady , these flowers BAYBAY You do n't have to whisper , she ca n't hear you . OZ Who ca n't hear me ? BAYBAY ( flips on the lights ) . The old lady . She ca n't hear you . Her hearing aid is busted . That damn thing cost me a fortune . The witch probably broke it herself .

And stop whispering , this ai n't no funeral home . I told you she ca n't hear you . Her hearing aid is messed up . What do they call you ? OZ Osborn , ma'am . My name is Osborn. p. 4 BAYBAY I did n't ask your name . And I ai n't no ma'am . I ask what they call you ? OZ Oz . Home folks call me Oz . Lady , these flowers , where do you want me to put them ?

Any strangers out there ? ( RUTH enters wheeling herself in her wheelchair . A large white umbrella lies across her lap . Her apron pocket holds bones wrapped in African fabric . She rolls over to OZ , eyeing him , circling him. ) p. 5 RUTH You a stranger ? OZ You ever seen me before ? RUTH Could be I seen you in a dreamBoy , you got a question ? OZ In this dream you had , was I delivering flowers ? See , I got these flowers ( Offers them to RUTH . ) RUTH You better get them things outta my face . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things outta my face .

Like respect for your elders , recipes and weather reports . Look like I 'm gon na need my umbrella soon but do n't be giving me no flowers today . BAYBAY You ai n't gon na need that umbrella for a long time . ( RUTH throws the bones , listens , then picks them up . NOTE : Throwing the bones may be mimed using a sound cue for effect . ) OZ The paper did n't say nothing about rain today . I got the weather report here in my right shoe and I 'm reading sunny with a chance of rainbows . Lady , what you doing with them bones ? ( RUTH ignores him . ) What kind of bones you got there ?

RUTH The bones say you been dreaming under the moon . Say you hungry . You come to the right place . BAYBAY Mama , be nice . Go back to bed . RUTH ( mocking BAYBAY ) . Mama , be nice . Go back to bed . ( Beat . ) I ai n't sick , I ai n't dead and I ai n't your mama . Mother Dear . Can you do something right just once ? I 've asked you to call me Mother Dear .

BAYBAY ( preachy , quoting ) . " Knowledge is the cornerstone of life . They said serve them and you also will be served . " We serve exclusively books by and about African Americans and other cultures of color for the nourishment of the mind , body and spirit . ( BAYBAY picks up a book at random and begins reading from it . ) Africans did not suffer cultural amnesia when they stepped off the slave ships Southern planters selected Africans for importation to North America on the basis of their skills in agriculture , medicine , carpentry , and so onThe Africans ' unpaid labor made slavery efficient and economicalAfrican influence on white culture continues to resonate in music , language , food , religion , fashion , cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their children and the U.S. economy continue to benefit from the interest on the profits of slavery through institutional racism and collective amnesia about that forty acres and a mule ( She finishes reading ) What am I supposed to do with all this information ?

They the ones want to know about this boy . I ai n't interested . ( Pause . ) Where them flowers come from ? Ai n't nobody dead yet . OZ Lady , I have to go . RUTH Baybay , lock the door and turn the sign around . They say they want to talk to him . p. 9 BAYBAY Mama ! RUTH You hear what I say ? Do it !

RUTH Be quiet so I can hear . ( She listens . OZ tries desperately to move but his feet are heavy to the floor as if he is standing in quicksand . ) OZ If I do n't get back soon I 'll lose my spot at the bus station . It starts getting crowded around this time . BAYBAY You gon na lose your life if you do n't shut up . ( BAYBAY whispers to the Ancestors . ) Shhh . Shhh . Shhh . Talk to Mama , I ai n't listening .

You ever had a sex disease ? ( Pause . ) Well , answer me . OZ ( embarrassed ) . No ! RUTH No , what ? OZ No , ma'am . I 've had a lot of things but I ai n't never had no sex disease .

One foot forward , two steps back , step on the line , break your daddy 's back . Through my feet the sages speak . ( OZ does a variety of hip-hop and African dance steps wildly around the room . At the end of the music he is exhausted as if he has been squeezed like a wet rag . ) BAYBAY So the ancestors speak through your big old feet . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTH Baybay , I said hush .

RUTH Eila 's coming back because it 's the right thing to do . She never should have left here . You the one pushed her out there like you know so much . When you mess with fire you liable to get barbecued . BAYBAY I went to the city and I did n't fall through the cracks . RUTH Then why you come back ? BAYBAY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . RUTH You just as tied to this place as I am , and so is Eila . You want to make out like she 's an island unto herself , but she 's just like you and me , she needs the power in this place . This place needs her to make the bridge from this place into the other one . BAYBAY I 'm plugging up my ears and putting on my travelling shoes . RUTH Give me a good reason to snatch that hair off your head and crack you like a coconut . You supposed to make something out of this life . We 're special . We can hear them .

EILA listens to the music trying to figure out where it 's coming from . OZ stares at EILA in amazement as if he sees a beautiful apparition . ) EILA Nice rhythms .

RUTH She 's going through the change . The ancestors are passing through her like a yellow-tailed sparrow . ( RUTH makes a swooping motion with her hand like a bird flying low , then claps . ) They were in my mother 's hands , she could heal with the light in the palm of her right hand . When I started hearing clearly , she helped me through . She stayed here with me until Baybay started to see , then she opened her umbrella and was gone . The change is coming on Eila hard because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this work , let alone do it by yourself . p. 20 EILA I see things . I feel things . I remember things in my bones .

That 's what you need , granddaughter . BAYBAY She could be a nun , could n't she ? Is that what you mean ? She could get engaged to God or even one of the Saints . We 'll have a big wedding party and after that she can sit up in a musty old room with a crown of thorns on her head twisting a cheap wedding ring on her finger waiting to die and join the groom in heaven . Is that what you wanted for me , Mama ? I got red honey between my thighs . I got sweet , mother 's milk in my breasts . I 've got desires . ( RUTH gets out of her chair , walks over to BAYBAY leaning on her umbrella . RUTH shakes her hard then walks back to her chair and drops down in it wearily . BAYBAY stunned , stares at RUTH . ) RUTH You do n't talk to me like that . I am your mother like it or not . I wo n't tolerate disrespect from you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't earn it , Mama .

He was dead and I was standing in the sun on the cliff laughing , still alive . " I wrote that . RUTH You could hardly give away that mess you wrote back then , why you want to read it now ?

Dorothy Dandridge is here . Malcolm X is here . Madam C.J. Walker is here . Sojourner Truth is here . We ca n't leave . Ai n't I a woman , by any means necessary , back to Africa , hair miracles and star magic . ( Beat . ) Be wise , Mama . Be wise . You can teach me things . One and one makes two ( BAYBAY joins EILA singing the childhood song , echoing her , and clapping hands like patty cake . ) BAYBAY Honey , I love you EILA AND BAYBAY Two and two make four , Baby , where 's the door ?

You never did know what to do for a baby . BAYBAY You taught me everything I know . EILA Will you two stop it . I came home so I could RUTH Bother us . EILA Mama BAYBAY What 's the matter , baby ? Somebody hurt you ? ( RUTH and BAYBAY repeat some of her words in a whisper , like an echo :  --  Japanese , moans , sync , eyes  --  as EILA speaks . ) EILA Mama , I 'm scared .

Lights change . ) I am walking down 42nd Street . Just walking , walking past the bright lights , the greasy smells , the loud colors . Car horns honking , leather-faced junkies trading dope in English , Spanish , and Japanese . ( Beat . ) A black Jesus is testifying about dying on the cross . I hear music . A heartbeat , a steady drumming , a chorus of voices that burst into a beautiful convulsion . Sounds : humming , a cat in heat , a woman screaming in the eye of an orgasm . I see them , frame by frame . There are homeless people stacked one on top of the other . People in high-heeled shoes are dancing on top of their bodies , pretending not to hear their moans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of silver , spike-heeled shoes . I am standing in the middle of a woman 's stomach . I look right into her eyes . She is scared just like me . She is screaming but no sound is coming out of her mouth . Things are out of sync . I remember that no one is looking into their eyes so I start yelling over the music and sounds and smells for everybody to " Look into their eyes . Look into their eyes . " ( End trance . ) When I came to myself I was standing in the same spot and no time had passed . p. 26 BAYBAY ( putting her arm around EILA ) . Ever since you was a little girl I told you that you were special , did n't I ?

They walked right into my bedroom one night , sat on the floor around my bed and whispered to me all night long . After I got over the first shock we had right pleasant conversations . ( Beat . ) I 'm a old woman , I need some rest . They been promising me a rest . Only thing left for me to do is get you settled and open my umbrella .

I could 've raced cars if I 'd wanted to . BAYBAY I 'm not scared of your driving . I 'm scared of leaving . I mean letting go of that place .

OZ Put some love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RUTH Plant my tree so the roots will lead me home . BAYBAY ( to RUTH ) . I 'll be calling your name . ( RUTH throws the bones center stage and circles them clockwise . The voices whisper . Lighting effect . RUTH opens her umbrella with a flourish and glittery confetti splashes over this scene . RUTH begins to dance a spirited cakewalk , BAYBAY puts her hand to her mouth in surprise , acceptance , then letting go . MR . FINE looks on as OZ , EILA and BAYBAY shuffle a joyous , New Orleans-style funeral march around RUTH . As RUTH dances offstage a visual image of her is projected to the umbrella . In the projection , she is dancing through an old cemetery waving a bouquet of white carnations . Sound of the Ancestors ' loud , whispering , voices overlapping , joyous , hopeful. )                                     @ @ @ @
