With borrowing costs rising and securities markets roiling , it is easy to forget that there 's a bright side to rising interest rates  --  namely , higher yields on savings and income investments . Today , by carefully shopping around , you can find top-quality stocks , bonds and mutual funds that pay out a tasty 7% or more . " For those who are willing to take on a little risk and hold for the long term , now is a good time to look at higher-yielding investments , " says John Rekenthaler , editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds ( $395 a year ; 800-876-5005 ) . " After taking such big hits , many stocks and bonds now offer excellent values  --  both high income and total-return potential . " True , the Fed 's four rate hikes last spring pounded interest-rate-sensitive investments : The average Treasury bond fund , for example , sank 5.23% in the first half of this year . The bruising has left many investors wondering if fixed-income issues are still right for their portfolios . ( See the story on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Federal Reserve Board likely to push up short-term rates to as high as 5% by the end of the year , anyone who ca n't stand the notion of a temporary dip in principal value should stick with ultrasecure investments , such as short-term CDs , money-market funds or Treasury bills . But for income investors , some combination of bonds and dividend-paying stocks is still the only way to earn steady yields . To shoot for higher returns without taking on too much volatility , Lewis Altfest , a self-employed financial planner in New York City , suggests this strategy : Keep a third of your income portfolio in supersafe , short-term investments , such as CDs and money funds ; another third in high-quality intermediate-maturity issues of no longer than 10 years ; and the remainder in higher-yielding bonds and equity income funds . The investments described below all offer yields of 7% or more , and are appropriate for the intermediate-and higher-risk thirds of your portfolio . We begin with the safest choices and conclude with higher-risk , higher-return issues : * Treasury notes . Safety-conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income portfolio might want to opt for a 10-year Treasury note , which currently yields 7.3% . " Intermediate bonds , which have maturities of five to 10 years , are the best bet for individual investors , " says Edward Martin , fixed-income manager at David L. Babson &; Co. , a Boston investment firm . " Over the long run , intermediates have provided 80% of the return of long-term bonds with only half the price risk . " You can buy Treasuries directly from the Federal Reserve Bank without paying a commission . For information , contact your local Fed branch or the Bureau of the Public Debt in Washington , D.C. ( 202-874-4000 , ext. 251 ) ; the minimum investment is only $1,000. * Ginnie Maes , If you like the security of owning government bonds but prefer a bit more yield , you should consider investing in so-called Ginnie Maes , which are securities based on pools of mortgages and backed by the Government National Mortgage Association . For small investors , the best way to invest is through mutual funds , which are currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising along with interest rates . They are not risk-free : In 1993 the average returns on Ginnie Mae funds lagged those of Treasury bonds of comparable maturity by almost four percentage points . That 's because falling interest rates encouraged homeowners to refinance their mortgages , thus reducing the effective yields on Ginnie Mae issues . But over the 10 years that ended June 1994 , the average mortgage fund has returned 9.9% annually , compared with 9.4% for the average Treasury portfolio . Two top no-load choices , according to Ralph Norton , managing editor of the Bond Fund Advisor newsletter ( $95 a year ; 800-343-5413 ) : Vanguard GNMA ( 30-day yield : 7% ; up an average of 8.4% a year for the five years that ended June 1994 ; 800-662-7447 ) and Benham GNMA ( yield : 7% ; up 8.3% ; 800-472-3389 ) . Another plus : Both funds avoid the exotic derivative issues that have caused steep losses in other mortgage bond funds . * Municipal bonds , Investors in the 28% tax bracket or higher ( taxable incomes of $38,001 or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singles ) should take a look at municipal bonds , whose income is free of federal taxes . The average muni fund recently yielded 5.2% , which is equivalent to 7.2% for an investor in the 28% bracket and 8.1% for those in the 36% bracket ( incomes above $140,000 for couples , $115,000 for singles ) . If you do n't have the $50,000 or so you need to assemble a diversified portfolio of individual bonds , consider funds . Two sound no-load choices , according to Jim Lynch , editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter ( $250 a year ; 212-663-5552 ) : Fidelity Limited Term Municipal ( yield 5.4% ; up 7.4% ; 800-544-8888 ) , which holds bonds with an average credit rating of AA and an average maturity of 9.7 years ; and Dreyfus Intermediate Muni ( yield : 5.1% ; up 7.6% ; 800-645-6561 ) , which also holds mainly AA-rated bonds with an average maturity of 9.4 years . * Utility stocks . This hard-hit sector now offers some compelling buying opportunities , according to Geraldine Weiss , editor of Investment Quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising interest rates and concerns over deregulation have helped push down the S &P; utility index by 10% this year , and many electric companies now transmit high-powered yields of 7% or more . Furthermore , Roger Conrad , editor of Utility Forecast newsletter ( $89 a year ; 800-832-2330 ) , predicts that utility stock prices will soon rebound , with the best of the bunch providing investors with total returns of as much as 15% over the next 12 months . If you have at least $20,000 to invest and time to do careful research , you might consider assembling your own utility portfolio . But pick cautiously and do n't put any more than 20% of your money in this sector . Conrad recommends looking for companies that earn no more than 25% of their sales from industrial customers , since , unlike residential customers who ca n't choose among utilities , businesses are often able to switch to cheaper competitors . Also , steer clear of companies that pay out more than 90% of earnings on dividends , since they are more likely to cut their payout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria , according to Weiss : Dominion Resources ( ticker symbol : D ; recently traded at $35.75 on the New York Stock Exchange ; yield : 7.1% ) , Potomac Electric Power ( POM ; NYSE , $20 ; 8.3% ) and Bathnore Gas &; Electric ( BGE ; NYSE , $22.50 ; 7% ) . * High-yield bond funds . If you think that investing in a junk bond fund , which buys the debt of troubled or bankrupt companies , is a sure way to lose money , think again . Over the past five years this group has turned in solid 9.7% average annual gains . Currently , the typical junk bond fund boasts a lofty annual payout of 9.4% . " High-yield funds are particularly timely now , " says Glen King Parker , editor of the Income Fund Outlook newsletter ( $49 a year ; 800-442-9000 ) . Chief reason : The performance of junk bonds is tied closely to the strength of the underlying companies that issue them and to the overall health of the economy , and are less vulnerable to rising interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up well during the recent Fed rate hikes , losing only 2.4% between January and April , compared with a 4.7% drop for the average Treasury bond fund . For safety 's sake , however , you should put no more than 20% of your fixed-income stake in junk issues . To further minimize risk , Parker recommends dividing your allocation among two or more no-load funds . His top picks : Vanguard High-Yield Corporate ( yield 9.8% ; up 8.9% annually over the past five years ) , which typically keeps more than 20% of its portfolio in investment-grade bonds , and Northeast Investors Trust ( yield 8.3% ; up 10.8% ; 800-225-6704 ) , whose careful selection of the lowest-rated issues has helped maintain a low-risk record : So far this year the fund has actually gained 3.3% . <p>
