George Carlin , with whom I guested on a late-night talk show last week , gave the best advice I have yet heard on how to promote a book . " I wrote mine and forgot everything in it , " the comedian said of his best-seller Brain Droppings . What , then , did he talk about on talk shows ? Carlin shrugged and said , " You ca n't go wrong attacking God and children . " // The fact is , you can say any blasphemous tiling you want as a touring author because nobody is listening , probably not even God . Trust me . While flogging my own sports book , Road Swing , around America these last 10 weeks , I have been the subject of relentless  --  one might say unprecedented  --  media inattention . A sportswriter in Milwaukee interviewed me for 10 minutes without allowing me even to speak . A radio host in Kentucky conducted a similar Q &amp; Q : After five minutes I put down the phone , vacuumed my apartment and returned to hear him still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Occasionally I am allowed a few words . In a Minneapolis bookstore I delivered a 60-minute sermon on America 's alarming obsession with sports , then grandly offered to entertain questions . An epic silence ensued , during which my armpits burst into flames , before a single hand finally floated up from the audience . The man cleared his throat and said , " Do you think relief pitchers should be eligible for the Cy Young ? " // The same evening I suggested that America 's alarming obsession with sports had reached its apotheosis with the election of a former pro wrestler as the governor of Minnesota . Six minutes later I signed a copy of my book to Jesse ( the Body ) Ventura. // The Body was until last July a sports-radio host . Hardly surprising , given his name : I have now discussed grave sports issues of the day with radio hosts named Coach , Common Man , Dark Star , Dream Weaver and  --  in Des Moines  --  the Round Guy . Each must be addressed as such on the air , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do when forced to order , in a fast-food restaurant , the Char-Chicken Choco-Taco Mexi-Melt Fiesta Fingers . // On one station  --  I ca n't remember where ; I 'm guessing Deep South  --  I took a call from a man named Bump . I do n't mean to suggest that all-sports radio is shameful , but why do the hosts and callers all seem to be using pseudonyms ? // While flying to Los Angeles to promote my book  --  about America 's alarming obsession with sports  --  I read that Houghton Mifflin has published an American history textbook for fifth-graders in which the Great Depression is given less space than the baseball career of Cal Ripken Jr . When I incorporated this fact into my spiel , most hosts and callers responded that Ripken 's career has lasted longer than the Great Depression . Not all of them , I now fear , were being ironic . // I do n't mean to complain . I am genuinely grateful to be America 's guest , particularly on television , where authors are usually bused to a bad neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stand . On any given talk show the author is always on last . This is an immutable law , an FCC regulation . Bob Costas recalls how self-conscious he felt about preceding eminent author David Halberstam on one program . A former late-night host himself , Costas foresees a day when the following teaser is read on a talk show : " Up next , Nelson Mandela . But first , Yasmine Bleeth. " // Personally , I 'd rather hear Mandela on the radio , addressing various Mad Dogs , Bulldogs and Bullfrogs . Heaven knows , this is one nation mat needs healing . And heeling.
