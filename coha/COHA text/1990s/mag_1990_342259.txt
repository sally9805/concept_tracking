At monthly meetings of Single Mothers by Choice in New York City , coded name tags speak volumes about the complexities of modern-day parenthood . The letter T indicates the woman is thinking about having a baby on her own . A signals that she is attempting to get pregnant . P announces that she has succeeded . M is for mother . The second letter on the tag flags her method of choice . I means donor insemination . N specifies a sex partner . A stands for adoption . <P> The women who wear the tags are pioneering the way  --  by choice  --  toward yet another permutation of the American family . They have made a calculated and intentional decision to raise a child single-handedly , despite a tangle of cultural , biological and sometimes legal complications . Virtually all either have tired of waiting for Mr. Right or have no interest in finding him . Most are women who have achieved a measure of economic self-sufficiency but have delayed childbearing to the point where they hear their biological clocks approaching midnight . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Paula Van Ness , 39 , executive director of the National Community AIDS Partnership in Washington , " but I could n't imagine going through life without a child .

Merle Bombardieri , a Boston-area psychotherapist , says that of the almost 1,000 women contemplating single motherhood whom she has counseled , about two-thirds are heterosexual and one- third lesbian . <P> Gail , a 38-year-old Los Angeles accountant , had been through a divorce and several failed romances when she began contemplating her decision . " My relationships were not developing along the course I had hoped , " she says . " I really love kids and feel I have a lot to offer . " She discussed the idea of single motherhood with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concern about encountering fertility problems as she grew older that convinced her that " the time had come . " She was impregnated by donor insemination , and was expecting a baby in late October . <P> While such a choice is unconventional , it is also natural , argues Dr. Robert Nachtigall , a reproductive endocrinologist in San Francisco . Because women have a monthly hormonal cycle , " they ca n't escape the fact that their bodies are telling them to do something , " he says . " The biological drive to reproduce may be stronger than the cultural yen to get married . " <P> Once a single woman has decided to follow that drive , she faces a choice of methods . Each option presents its own perils . For adoption , there are long waits , deals that fall through , no control over genes . Intercourse with a selected partner or insemination by a known donor can open the door to future wrangles over custodial rights .
