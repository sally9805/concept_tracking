Section : PRIORITIES <p> Just because the gray wolf is an endangered species does n't mean it 's necessarily a welcome one . Eliminated from the northern Rockies by poison and hunting in the 1920s , wolves are now tackling back into this country from British Columbia , repopulating old haunts without regard to Wolf Management Plans or other forms of bureaucratic assistance . As many as 50 wolves are believed to have returned to Montana , and sightings are increasing in Wyoming , Idaho , and Washington . Not content to stick around their " wolf recovery zones , " the repatriated wolves go where they please , daunting their federal protection ( killing one could cost you five years and $50,000 ) , and occasionally lurking next to someone 's corral , ogling the cattle . <p> Unfortunately , Canis lupus did not abandon its predatory ways during its Canadian exile . Wolves will be wolves : They inevitably jostle you-know-who for top-dog position in the food chain , feasting on deer and elk and maybe a pre-hamburger calf or two , howling at the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves that eat the wrong prey are either relocated by the Fish and Wildlife Service or killed by Animal Damage Control , the Agriculture Department 's anti-predator SWAT team . The results of relocation have thus far been fairly dismal . In a particularly pathetic case in 1989 , a family of wolves suspected of killing calves on a Montana ranch was trapped and moved to Glacier National Park . All died except for one hardy female , who fled the park , swam the Hungry Horse Reservoir , and headed south toward Missoula . She found another mate and started a new den , but then was shot by an unknown hunter ; her mate was run over by a car . <p> As both pro- and anti-wolf interests clamored for their own versions of a new wolf policy , Congress punted the issue to the ten-member Wolf Management Committee , made up of six representatives from federal and state agencies , two environmentalists , a rancher , and a hunter . At the top of the committee 's agenda was a plan to reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per feet biodiversity , " says John Barley , chief of wolf research at the park . " This would be the only place in the lower 48 states that would have all of the flora and fauna it had when Christopher Columbus stepped ashore . Why ca n't a society as rich as ours set aside one place like that ? " <p> Why , to stay rich , the ranchers , loggers , outfitters , and oilmen would reply . " Our position is , no wolves , " says Carolyn Paseneaux of the Wyoming Woolgrowers Association . " Ranching does not have a very big margin , so any amount of depredation is very problematic . " Predictable howls of outrage come from those who fear the wolf will become another grizzly or spotted owl , whose protection would restrict drilling , mining , and logging on public lands . Wolf-committee member Pete Petera , who also serves as head of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department , expresses the concern that wolves would prey on herds of moose and bighorn sheep , the sport-hunting of which brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems kind of incongruous , " he says , " to ask a hunter to pay for a competitor . " <p> On the evening before its April 30 deadline , the wolf committee was still hopelessly deadlocked . Regional Fish and Wildlife Service Director Galen Buterbaugh put in a call to John Turner , his boss in Washington . Desperate to reach some conclusion , the two hurriedly cobbled together a new proposal . When the committee met again the next morning , Buterbaugh and the two other federal representatives , who had previously supported the two environmentalists , executed a smart volte-face and voted with the wolf foes . <p> This is the so-called " compromise " agreement : While acquiescing to the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone , the committee voted 8 to 2 to downgrade the wolf from " endangered species " to the much less protected " experimental population , " allowing ranchers to solve their wolf problems with a .30-.30 . ( Wolf-killers would not even be required to prove " depredation " of their herds ; " harassment " alone could earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1993 , control over all wolves except those in national parks would fall to the individual states  --  all of which are dead set against the animals . Tom Dougherty , who represented the National Wildlife Federation on the committee , called its final recommendation " the most depressing piece of wildlife-management planning I have ever witnessed . " <p> Luckily for the lobo , this depredation against the Endangered Species Act was summarily rejected by the House . The wolf is now back at the door of the Senate Environment Committee , where Western ranching interests have consistently blocked funding for wolf recovery . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A WOLF <p> By Paul Rauber , Edited by Reed McManus <p>
