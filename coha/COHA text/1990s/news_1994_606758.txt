<p> Last Friday was another lucrative day for the gold-plated gubernatorial campaign of Maryland Democrat Parris N. Glendening . <p> Morning brought a $ 1,000-a-plate breakfast at Baltimore 's Center Club for more than 70 of the city 's leading civic and business figures . Later , Glendening zipped down the expressway to collect $ 50,000 at an Upper Marlboro reception sponsored by one of Annapolis 's top lobbying firms . <p> But that was small change compared with the contributions Glendening hopes to harvest tomorrow night , when his campaign expects more than 2,500 people to attend a celebration for the nominee at the Baltimore Convention Center . Anticipated take : more than $ 500,000 . <p> Glendening is on a political fund-raising binge the likes of which Maryland gubernatorial politics has never seen before . By the time the campaign is over Nov. 8 , the Glendening campaign expects to have collected nearly $ 6 million . His campaign aides said he will spend $ 2.5 million on the two-month general election campaign ; the rest was spent in the primary . By contrast , GOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her campaign , and rules stipulate she can spend no more than $ 1 million . <p> Though their styles may be different , in his approach to fund-raising Glendening is a suburban version of Gov . William Donald Schaefer , who mined his lengthy list of business contacts as mayor of Baltimore in creating what was  --  until this year  --  the state 's largest gubernatorial war chest . Schaefer raised $ 3.5 million for his 1986 gubernatorial bid and $ 2.7 million for his reelection in 1990 . <p> Like Schaefer , who aggressively promoted Baltimore , Glendening made his mark as a cheerleader for his home base , Prince George 's County , wooing the business community from the moment he was sworn in as county executive in 1982 . He promoted building and construction enthusiastically , expanded minority contracting , created an Economic Development Corporation to recruit companies and maintained an open door for any executive who wanted to invest in Prince George 's . <p> In return , the area 's business leaders have opened their wallets to assist Glendening 's political rise , providing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who barely was known outside the Washington area a year ago . Many of Glendening 's biggest donors and fund-raisers have enjoyed financial benefits from the county , from developers who hold lucrative county leases to lawyers doing bond and other legal work to entrepreneurs winning county service contracts . <p> Joshua I. Smith Sr. , a Republican and chairman of Maxima Corp. , a Lanham-based computer firm that holds a $ 6.2 million annual contract to provide data processing services to the county government , describes Glendening as the rare politician who has " delivered " in measurable terms , increasing the volume of minority contracts and helping to recruit business to the county . " I do n't think Parris is doing anything anyone else is n't doing , " he said of Glendening 's efforts to solicit campaign donations from groups doing business in Prince George 's . " If the relationships are credible , then obviously a smart politician will draw upon those relationships for fund-raising and support . " <p> Others offer a more cynical assessment , pointing in particular to the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers and others who benefited from the spectacular real estate boom in Prince George 's in the 1980s . Though Glendening likes to take some of the credit for the spurt , some civic activists accuse him of helping to accelerate the suburban sprawl they believe has damaged the fabric of many neighborhoods . <p> " He was a pliant servant of the development community , " said Walter H. Maloney , a Glendening critic and Beltsville Democrat who is running for a seat on the Prince George 's County Council . " He 's their guy , and these guys do n't give campaign contributions out of the generosity of their heart . " <p> Glendening does not flinch from the reality of modern campaigning , which dictates an almost round-the-clock rush for funds . His aides describe a highly disciplined candidate who 's willing to spend hours on the telephone wooing big donors : Finance director John P. Davey estimated that the campaign has held more than 200 fund-raisers in the last two years , many of them small house parties , and said Glendening is spending anywhere from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Glendening knows that the fund-raising tilt offers perhaps his most significant advantage in his battle with Sauerbrey , enabling him to run more than twice as much television advertising as the GOP delegate from Baltimore County , according to media buyers and campaign officials . <p> Last week , for instance , the average television viewer in the Baltimore and Washington areas saw Glendening 's commercials an average of six times , compared with about three for Sauerbrey 's ads , or barely enough to make an imprint on most viewers , media specialists said . <p> " His strategy is to spend almost all of his time raising money , so he can run attack ads , " Sauerbrey said recently . " He knows that I ca n't respond by buying television time to compete with that . " <p> Though they may not like the practice , even some of his severest critics said Glendening merely is doing what political candidates everywhere do under the prevailing system of private campaign financing  --  only better . <p> " Everybody tries to do it . He 's just successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer and Laurel civic activist who has battled Glendening on various land-use issues . " He 's one of the best I 've ever seen . He knows how to play the business community . " <p> Glendening expresses little sympathy for Sauerbrey 's predicament , noting that she made the choice to accept public funding and must live within the rules . He also dismisses the suggestion that as governor he might be beholden to the corporations and special interests that have contributed to his campaign . <p> " No one has a disproportionate influence at all , " Glendening said during a $ 30-a-head fund-raiser Monday in Calvert County . His campaign said he has received more than 12,000 individual contributions , 56 percent of which are for $ 100 or less . <p> Glendening disputed the assertion by Maloney and other critics that his donors get anything for their support but " good government . " <p> " Business supports me , and I 'm proud of it , because I have set a climate that is good for business and good for jobs in Prince George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same climate statewide . " <p> Glendening advisers said his list of contributors purposefully includes so many diverse  --  and in some cases competing  --  special interests that he ca n't be said to be in the pocket of any group or individual . <p> He has collected large sums from both doctors , who favor limits on the right to sue , and trial lawyers , who oppose such limits . He 's raised funds from developers , builders and other wealthy businesspeople , as well as numerous labor unions . <p> Unlike Schaefer , Glendening 's fund-raising base is in the Washington suburbs , where leaders complain about being shut out of state politics . But he 's also tapped the Baltimore business establishment , which is worried about losing ground to Washington . <p> The 52-year-old college professor also has made inroads into groups that traditionally have n't been major participants in Maryland politics , including African American government contractors , Korean American businesspeople and Latinos . His campaign treasurer , Baltimore lawyer Lalit H. Gadhia , said Glendening has held at least a half-dozen fund-raisers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75,000 with " more to come . " <p> " Parris is the first one to have an Indian American as his treasurer , " Gadhia said . " That 's a good example of his inclusiveness . " <p> Gadhia 's example highlights the relentless networking that has occupied Glendening since his early days on the Hyattsville City Council . His campaign finance reports are filled with names of contributors who have come into contact with Glendening from his work with regional groups such as the Greater Washington Board of Trade and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments . He 's wooed Jewish leaders by offering county help in resettling Russian immigrants and setting up a sister-city relationship with the Israeli city of Rishon LeZion . J. Richard Lilly , a Hyattsville doctor and president-elect of the state medical society , is the Glendening family 's physician and has become one of his major conduits to the state 's health care community . And , of course , there are the perks that flow from running the equivalent of a $ 1 billion corporation that comes into contact with business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Quirk , the chief executive of Macro International , wrote a $ 2,000 check to the Glendening campaign after being wowed by the county government 's efforts to expedite his consulting firm 's move into new offices in Calverton . " As a result of that experience , and a fairly positive view of the whole government , you 've got to give credit to the man at the top , " said Quirk , a Virginia Republican . <p> Daniel M. Clements is a Baltimore lawyer who heads the political action committee for the state 's trial lawyers , which recently endorsed Glendening and gave him the maximum $ 6,000 contribution . Clements said he became convinced of Glendening 's organizational skills after running into him more than a year ago at a fund-raiser for abortion-rights activists . <p> " Five days later we had a letter at home saying how good it was to meet me , my wife , and how glad he was to be on the same side of an issue , " Clements recalled . " I 'm not a novice at this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's just smarter . "
