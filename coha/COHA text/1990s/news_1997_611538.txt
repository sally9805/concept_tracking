<p> In one easy step last week , a group of businessmen in Chicago tried to transform the messy , confusing debate over the Clinton administration 's proposed new clean air standards into a concept that every American can understand : Barbecuing . <p> Armed with a hibachi and a bag of briquettes , the men marched into a news conference in a downtown hotel to make a powerful , if unsubstantiated , prediction . Allow the controversial regulations to become law , they said , and you can kiss these things goodbye . A banner in the room put it succinctly : " Do n't take my barbecue away ! " <p> At the same time  --  in the same Chicago hotel  --  supporters of the proposed standards for urban smog and soot were making an emotional pitch of their own . Before a crowd of reporters and TV cameras , environmental groups introduced Kyle Damitz , an 8-year-old asthma sufferer . The boy described calmly the painful attacks that sometimes send him to the emergency room on the smoggiest days . <p> " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to pollute the air ? " <p> With provocative encounters such as these , supporters and opponents have been cranking up the volume in the new year 's most contentious environmental fight  --  the battle over the proposed tightening of federal standards for air pollution . For nearly two weeks , dueling sides have been slugging it out in hearing rooms and on the airwaves around the country in a warm-up to the first significant test of the proposal on Capital Hill . <p> On Feb. 5 , a Senate subcommittee is scheduled to open the first of at least two rounds of public hearings on the standards , which would impose tough new limits for two kinds of air pollution  --  ground-level ozone , or smog , and a class of very fine dust-like particles known as particulates . Both sides view the hearings as critical because they could help determine whether the Republican-controlled Congress decides to exercise its new authority to block federal regulations from taking effect . <p> The EPA proposed the standards in November , citing scientific studies suggesting that current pollution standards do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the most significant tightening of air pollution rules in six years  --  would improve the lives of millions of Americans who suffer respiratory diseases while preventing about 20,000 premature deaths each year . <p> A coalition of industry groups has mounted an expensive campaign to block the new standards , saying businesses are being asked to pay too high a price for regulations that they say would yield , at best , only modest improvements in public health . <p> Air quality in the United States has been steadily improving since the initial adoption of the Clean Air Act more than two decades ago , and industry opponents say the government should give the existing rules more time to work . <p> " They 're moving the goalpost just as we 're starting to see the goal line , " said Al Mannato , senior regulatory analyst for the American Petroleum Institute . <p> Regulators acknowledge that if the rules go into effect in June as planned , hundreds of counties , including all those in the Washington area , would find themselves out of compliance with federal regulations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much of the estimated $ 6 billion to $ 8 billion in costs would fall on polluting industries such as steel mills and power plants , but ordinary customers in some areas could also end up facing new restrictions and higher costs . <p> In a campaign timed with the start of public hearings that the EPA held last week around the country on the new standards , opponents ran radio and newspaper advertisements suggesting that some favorite American pastimes could be in jeopardy . In one radio spot that ran in Chicago , actors playing the roles of a pediatrician and his son discussed the possibilities : <p> Father 's voice : These new regulations would drive up the price of cars , force people into car pools and maybe even end up banning things like barbecue grills and lawn mowers . <p> Son 's voice : Force us to change the way we live , huh ? <p> Father 's voice : I read in the Sun-Times where it could cost Chicagoans $ 17 billion ! <p> Environmental groups challenged the accuracy of the ad , and on Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until the commercial 's claims could be investigated . An EPA spokesman said that it 's theoretically possible that a state could restrict activities like barbecuing to comply with the new federal standards . But that kind of " draconian " measure was highly unlikely , given the relatively small amounts of air pollution produced by such sources , the spokesman said . <p> Meanwhile , the American Lung Association and Sierra Club , two supporters of the new standards , have run radio ads in several markets touting the benefits of cleaner air . The groups also helped deliver scores of witnesses to two days of public hearings last week in Chicago , Salt Lake City , Boston and Durham , N.C. <p> At least 116 witnesses lined up three deep at microphones to testify at the Chicago hearings , and large groups also filed into hearing rooms on Tuesday and Wednesday in Boston , Salt Lake City and Durham . Opponents who spoke were trade group representatives and businessmen , while supporters included physicians , people with respiratory illnesses and environmentalists . Some of the most powerful testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health care workers who care for them . <p> " When the air turns brown , the emergency rooms fill up , " said Paul Lebow , a fellow at the College of Emergency Physicians in Bangor , Maine . " Maine is sick of being America 's tailpipe . " <p> But while much of the recent public debate about the standards has centered on the potential costs and benefits of tighter regulations , some of the biggest fights have been over science  --  specifically , whether scientists know enough about the health effects of pollution to justify changing the standards . <p> Senate Republicans have decided to make science the focus of the first congressional hearings . One legislator who has publicly questioned the standards is Sen. John H. Chafee , ( R-R.I. ) considered one of the party 's strongest advocates for the environment . <p> In a recent speech to chemical industry executives , Chafee said public health benefits " might not justify the cost " of tightening the standards for ozone . He also cited " questionable gaps " in scientific knowledge about the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a risk that the potential standards may lead to expensive controls targeted at the wrong aspect of the pollution problem , " Chafee said . <p> Such remarks have angered top EPA officials , who reviewed more than 1,000 scientific studies before deciding to change the standards . The need for tighter restrictions also was endorsed overwhelmingly by the lung tissue . <p> " Some of the industries have decided that they have to take a stand at all cost to stop any new standards from being adopted , " said Mary Nichols , EPA 's assistant administrator for air and radiation . " I think they picked the wrong issue . " <p> But overall , the agency appeared to have gained ground on the science front with several important endorsements . At last week 's public hearings , more than 100 scientists , physicians and health care workers submitted letters urging President Clinton to adopt the tougher standards . Another group of 500 medical experts were expected to deliver similar letters before the start of the congressional hearings in two weeks . <p> Additional , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research institute that convened a controversial workshop on the EPA standards last week . The workshop at the Annapolis Center in Maryland came under attack by environmentalists and several prominent scientists because many of the researchers who were invited to critique the EPA 's proposals had ties to industry . The center itself was founded by an executive of the National Association of Manufacturers , a chief opponent of the proposed regulations , although the center 's stated mission is to be an objective voice in weighing regulatory issues . <p> When the two-day workshop ended on Friday , the majority of panel members had not identified serious flaws in the body of research that formed the basis of the EPA 's proposals , according to two who attended the session . Individual panelists continued to disagree sharply over whether the Clinton administration 's standards were appropriate , given the available data . <p> " There was no consensus from this group and no real attempt to reach a consensus , " said Lucas Neas , a Harvard University researcher who participated . One of the few EPA supporters at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had held little hope of swaying the entire panel to his point of view .

" he said . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 29 , 1997 <p> CORRECTION : An article on Friday incorrectly reported that a Chicago radio station had suspended airing an advertisement opposing stricter air-quality standards because of complaints about alleged inaccuracies . The ad by the group Citizens for a Sound Economy was discontinued because its scheduled running time had expired .
