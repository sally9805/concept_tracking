In April 1988 a tiny organization called the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights gathered in the East Berlin apartment of Gerd and Ulrike Poppe to draft a letter protesting the deportation of two of the group 's members . The 15 people at the meeting had been close friends for years . Most were involved in Lutheran church activities ; two were pastors . And at least four of the 15 were also paid informers of the East German Ministry for State Security , the Stasi . <P> The Poppes , who were denied educational opportunities and adequate housing during the Stasi 's reign , have now been allowed to see the reports prepared by those former friends , and to learn the depth of their betrayal . The documents , which also revealed Stasi attempts to break up the Poppes ' marriage , are part of the secret archives opened Jan. 1 for inspection by the 6 million eastern Germans  --  one-third of the population  --  on whom dossiers were compiled . More than 300,000 have applied to read their files . <P> Many are appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brothers , sisters , spouses  --  some 200,000 " unofficial co-workers " in all . The custodian of the files , Joachim Gauck , warns former citizens of the east to " think twice before applying  --  the shock could cause family catastrophes . One should look deeply inside oneself before making this decision . " <P> What file readers discover is just how pervasive the network of betrayal was . Stasi tentacles extended into the schoolroom , the pulpit , the bedroom , even the confessional : Roman Catholic authorities are investigating indications that penitents ' confessions reached the Stasi through hidden microphones or corrupted priests . Stasi technicians bugged homes , telephones , cars and seats in concert halls . The Stasi 's " Section 8 " dealt with children , requiring principals of every school in the country to keep a file of " dangerous persons " in their classrooms . Teachers filled out forms on " conspicuous " children , some as young as 9 , who expressed views critical of the state or favorable to the West . The information went into the archives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or higher education . The teachers dared not refuse to report . " We had 30 pairs of eyes focused on us , " said one . " We had to be careful . " <P> Some who have seen their files are astounded less by the contents than by the sheer volume of a record so large that even the 90,000-member Stasi force could not handle it . " They were drowning in their own paper , " said Werner Fischer , a former dissident who supervised the archives in early 1990 during the dismantlement of the hated ministry . In the Stasi 's beige concrete former headquarters on East Berlin 's Normannenstrasse , files lie in folders , binders , boxes and brown paper bags , stacked in five floors of rotating shelves a total of 125 miles long . Some papers are baled and tied with twine , some are scattered loose , some are stuffed unsorted into canvas bags . " We found letters we never received , " said Gerd Poppe . " There were pictures taken through our window , transcripts of taped telephone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could not be evaluated . "
