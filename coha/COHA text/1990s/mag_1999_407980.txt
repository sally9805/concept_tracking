Far , far away , where the turquoise sky met the gray dessert , the sun 's great fiery ball dropped slowly out of sight . By the fading light , Star Flower sat on the ground before her loom . With swift fingers she passed the bright-colored yarn back and forth , weaving lovely patterns in her rug . Nearby , in front of their summer home made of leafy branches , her mother was cooking some coarse bread over a tiny fire of twigs . There would be little else for supper tonight . In all the desert there was hardly a sound but the steady thump , thump , thump as Star Flower beat down the yarn with her heavy batten stick , and the cling clang of her father 's hammer as he pounded a bit of silver at his small forge . Tonight Star Flower 's thoughts moved as swiftly as her flying fingers . She was thinking of the long , hot summer . It had been a hard one for her family and for all the rest of her tribe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day after day the sun had blazed without pity . The ground was cracked and hard and Star Flower 's little patch of corn and squash was scorched and withered . She remembered how Mother had sometimes saddled her pony and ridden to the trading post with the lovely blanket she had made tied to the saddle string . There she had exchanged it for food , and calico to make their clothes . Then one by one , Mother 's lovely pieces of silver jewelry and Father 's heavy silver belt had been taken to the post to pay for flour , coffee , sugar , and other things they needed to help them over the bad summer . But now they had nothing left to trade and their food supplies were gone . Star Flower looked down at the heavy silver chain that hung around her own neck . Her father , Eagle Flight , had made it for her and set it with the big pieces of blue turquoise that all her people loved . She knew the blue stones had a magic to protect the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her father had promised to make her a bracelet to match it . She would wear them to the big ceremony in the fall . Then the Navajos would come together from all over the desert . They would wear their best clothes and finest jewelry and there would be singing , feasting , and dancing for many days and nights . As the last daylight faded , Star Flower saw her little sister trotting home behind their flock of sheep and goats . She was late tonight , for she had taken the animals far away to find fresh pasture and a water hole that had not been dried up by the hot desert wind and sun . Her long , full skirts swirled around her feet , for she was hurrying to reach the safety of her home . She well knew that after sundown the coyotes prowled about the desert and followed the herds to make a meal on any baby sheep that lagged behind . Mother stopped her work and went to let down the bars of the corral just behind the family 's shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his work and stretched himself . He was tall and slimwaisted , and there was a dignity in the clear-cut features of his bronze-skinned face . A red bandana was fastened around his head and his long black hair was tied in a knot behind . Two large turquoise stones hung from his ears-a sign to the gods that he was protected . " Still the sun sinks red , " he said . " The raingods do not hear the prayers of the Navajos . " And because he was sad , he began to sing . Because he was a Navajo he made up his own song-telling of the great desert , the dying corn , his hungry sheep . And he begged the rain clouds to pour down their waters on the dry sands . That night after their meager supper , the little family rolled up in their blankets and lay down on the sheepskins with their feet toward the fire . But Star Flower lay wide awake for a long time , listening to the hooting of a little owl and the lonely cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks . But only the darkness knew that , and kept her secret . Finally she drifted off to sleep , holding very tightly to the precious silver chain around her neck . The sun had hardly started its journey across the sky next day when Star Flower crept out of her blanket . She shook out her long skirt , smoothed back her shiny black hair and slipped out to the horse corral . It was only a few minutes ' work to catch and saddle her pony . Soon she was flying over the desert toward the trading post . She had never been there alone before and was a bit afraid of the big white man with whom her mother had always traded . On and on she rode , seeing only a scurrying rabbit , or lizards sleeping on the hot sand . The sun was climbing higher and higher . The wind was dry and hot . At last she reached the trading post , tied her pony , and slowly walked in . Her soft moccasins made no noise , and she looked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his desk and spying her over the top of his spectacles , the old trader boomed out , " Well , little miss , where is your mother ? " Star Flower jumped at the sound of his voice , then looked down at her toes , for she was very shy . Finally she gathered up her courage . " Please , I come alone . I bring this , " she replied , and then handed him her silver chain . " This summer the raingods forget the Navajos . You take this and give Star Flower food . Some day I bring a blanket and buy back my necklace . " The old trader shook his head and pointed to the glass cases filled with belts , buckles , necklaces , bracelets , and harness trimmings . " I 'm sorry , little girl , but every Indian on the reservation has been in here , bringing me his hard goods ' to keep for him and taking out my foodstuffs . " Star Flower did not say a word , but reached for the silver necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seeing the look in her dark eyes , he began to examine the necklace more carefully . " This is some of your father 's work , I can see . There 's not a better silversmith on the desert than Eagle Flight . I guess I can help you out . What 'll you have ? " he asked . Photograph Photograph // Star Flower looked at the bolts of bright calicoes and rich-colored velvets , and the shelves and shelves of canned goods . Then she made her selection slowly and with great care , as she had seen her mother do . When she started out for home , there were bundles of foodstuffs fastened to her saddle-enough to last for many days . Then next morning the skies were dark-and the rain came . It brought new life to the little garden and filled the dried-up water holes . Then Eagle Flight said , " The rain-gods are pleased with Star Flower . She has the courae of the Navajo . " And he sang a prayer of thankfulness . Summer slipped away and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the family sat huddled around the fire , eating their supper of sizzled mutton ribs with cornbread . The wind whistled through the branches of the open summer shelter . Star Flower tucked her skirts about her ankles and edged closer to the warmth of the fire . Eagle Flight pulled his blanket tighter around him and said , " Cold weather is here . We must leave this summer home and find a place to build our winter hogan . " With the cold , early dawn , Father was away to round up the horses . Star Flower smelled the food cooking and woke up Little Sister who was sleeping next to her . After breakfast , the frying pan was scoured out with clean sand and wrapped in the blankets . Star Flower and her mother took down the looms and rolled up their weaving . Soon their few belongings were tied in the sheepskins and loaded in the wagon . The desert was painted with lovely sunrise colors when the procession started off on the long journey to find a new home . Father rode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along in the wagon . Then came the sheep and goats . Star Flower rode at the end of the line to watch for any stray sheep that might lag behind . They had to travel slowly , on account of the animals . The sun rose higher in the sky , and Star Flower grew thirsty from the dust kicked un bs the sheeP . Sometimes they passed a deserted summer shelter from which the family had already moved to its winter hogan . Occasionally a lone rider dashed past them on horseback , sitting his saddle with the ease and grace of a true son of the desert . Star Flower was growing weary when she saw her father pull in his horse , for he had found a watering hole where the animals could drink . After their lunch of dried meat and cold bread , they mounted their horses and started on again . Hour after hour dragged by . The sun was well on its homeward journey when they came to the entrance of a deep gorge where a little river had cut its way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed the stream-bed up the canyon . Photograph // Now they were hemmed in by towering cliffs of red and yellow sandstone that rose straight and smooth on either side . Star Flower could see the great dark caves high up on the walls of the canyon . She felt very small indeed , trotting along on the bottom of this huge deep crack . Sometimes the canyon widened out into little grassy coves where the Indians who lived there year-round had their gardens and peach trees . But often the walls of the great cliffs were so close together , the sunlight never reached the bottom . Eagle Flight found a sheltered place in the hollow of a cliff where they could rest for the night . Mother cooked hot food and spread the sheepskins . After they had eaten , they curled up in their blankets and went sound asleep . The next morning , friends and neighbors came to help Eagle Flight build his new hogan . " We will place it here , " he said , " facing the East , so that the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and bless us . " Big logs were soon cut and set up to make the round framework . It was covered with branches and the cracks chinked up with mud . Then Mother asked everyone to stay and see the home blessed , and prepared food for the guests . When everything was ready , she swept the dirt floor clean and made a fire under the smoke hole in the roof A bowl of white corn meal was handed to Eagle Flight and he rubbed some of it on the four posts and sprinkled some around the edge of the room . All the people kept very still while he chanted : " May it be beautiful , my house , From my head , may it be beautiful , To my feet , may it be beautiful . Where I lie , may it be beautiful . All around me , may it be beautiful . " Then he tossed some corn meal into the fire and said , " May it be beautiful , my fire . " He flung a handful out the smoke hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends to come . When the ceremony was over , the big blanket was hung at the doorway and all the family belongings were moved inside . Food was brought in and everyone ate and enjoyed himself During the days that followed , Star Flower 's thoughts were turned toward the big ceremony that would soon take place . She must have her necklace to wear then ; so she hurried to finish her blanket . When she was not helping Mother sew the new clothes for the ceremony , she was sitting at her loom . Into her blanket she was weaving the story of her silver necklace . There was the gray desert , the bright red sun , the stalks of corn , and the big rain clouds . She worked carefully and patiently . All her hopes were woven into this blanket . It must be a perfect one . At last it was done , and she took it off the loom . The colors are beautiful she thought , and the weaving is close and fine . But will the trader find it good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket to her saddle and started out . She must be back in time for the ceremony . When Star Flower entered the hogan later , Eagle Flight knew by her happy smile and the silver chain around her neck that her blanket had found favor in the eyes of the trader . Then he spoke to her and said , " Little daughter , these ten years you have been called Star Flower . It is your baby name , given to you because the night you were born the black sky was sprinkled with stars like a field of flowers . But now you have earned your real name . By your willingness to give up the thing you loved most to help your family , and by your hard work and courage to win it back , you have earned the name of Brave-weaver . ' I shall announce your new name at the ceremony . Cherish this name and do not use it often , lest you spoil its meaning . " Star Flower was even more proud and happy to hear these words from her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navajos from all over the desert began to arrive for the ceremony . Star Flower had been to many sings and ceremonies with her parents , but this was the first one in which she had her real name . Now that she was ten years old , she would be considered a woman and know all the grownup secrets . The days that followed were filled with feasting , chanting , and dancing . Between times there were games and horse racing . And like all ceremonies , there was a sick person to be cured by the medicine man . The last day , however , was the busiest of all . The men cleared the dance ground and chopped large amounts of wood to keep the fire burning all night . Women were busy handing out food to the people who sat around eating and chatting . Star Flower was dressed in her finest clothes , a long ruffled skirt that swished when she walked , and a little green velvet jacket . But best of all , she was wearing the necklace with its magic blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the medicine man , who chanted long prayers for the sick person . And while he chanted , dancers , masked to look like gods , jogged around the fire . Their bodies were smeared with white clay and they wore dangling fox skins and masses of jewelry that gleamed in the firelight . Star Flower 's eyes were smarting from the wood smoke , and she grew sleepy listening to the chanting , the beating drums , and the thudding feet . But she did want to stay awake and see the dancers that came next . These , too , wore strange , big masks to look like gods and goddesses . They began dancing , yelling , stamping up and down , and raising their arms and letting them fall in time with the pounding rhythm . On and on it went , chanting and dancing , dancing and chanting . Star Flower shivered in the chilly night wind and snuggled closer to her father . She tried to be grown-up and stay awake , but her head grew heavy and her eyelids drooped . From time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flickering fires , leaping , dancing figures , a circle of people , and the starry sky . The next thing she knew , Father was saying , " Wake up , Star Flower . " She looked around . Darkness was giving way to daylight . The red fires had turned to ashes and the last team of dancers was prancing off . Photograph Photograph // <p>
