In the 1980s rapid growth came easily to J.B. Hunt Transport . In the years ahead the company will have to fight much harder . <p> AMONG THE COUNTRY 'S larger interstate trucking companies , few have grown faster or more profitably than J.B. Hunt Transport Services , Inc . Headquartered in Lowell , Ark. , $575 million ( likely 1990 revenues ) Hunt is a truckload carrier , meaning it picks up truckloads of merchandise and delivers them wherever the customer wants . <p> Hunt is also a nonunion trucker . This meant that when interstate trucking was deregulated in 1980 , Hunt 's low cost structure enabled it to grab business easily from its established unionized competitors . During the mid-1980s Hunt grew at 30% and more each year . Its net margins routinely exceeded 10% , versus margins of under 5% for the big , unionized , less-than-truckload carriers like Consolidated Freightways , Yellow Freight System and Roadway Services . ( Lessthan-truckload operators typically transport partial loads within a network of terminals . ) <p> Lately , however , Hunt 's growth has dropped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuel costs are rising . As the economy softens , rate increases are hard to make stick . And a shortage of big-rig drivers is pushing up labor costs . Overall , J.B. Hunt has watched its operating costs rise from 77% of revenues just four years ago to nearly 90% today . <p> Hunt counts among its contract customers many well-heeled corporations , including Procter &; Gamble and Wal-Mart Stores . Its rigs run fully loaded 95% of the time , as against a truckload industry average of 90% . Nonetheless , Hunt 's profit dropped 7% last year , to $30 million , or $1.30 a share , on revenues of $509 million . This year and next , earnings will likely be flat . <p> On Wall Street the stock has been run over . Recently trading at 15 , it is well below Hunt 's 23-a-share high . The stock 's rapid descent was enough to knock chairman and founder Johnnie Bryan Hunt , 63 , off The Forbes Four Hundred list of the richest Americans . His 46% stake in the company is now valued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that 's not what keeps Hunt awake at night . <p> What is troubling are those rising operating costs and declining tariffs . Thanks to the Middle East confrontation , Hunt now pays around $1.50 a gallon for diesel fuel . That 's 45 cents a gallon more than just six months ago ; a fuel surcharge that took effect in August only covers about 85% of that expense . New trucks  --  Hunt buys upwards of 1,000 tractors a year on average , all from Navistar  --  are more fuel efficient . But they also cost 10% more than they did five years ago . Lately Hunt has been keeping its tractors and trailers in service longer . <p> Expensive as it is , fuel accounts for only about 15% or so of Hunt 's operating expenses ; fuel is a problem Hunt can live with . A much bigger concern is drivers . Even for a nonunion shop like Hunt , labor eats up more than 42% of revenues  --  if the company can find drivers . But there have n't been enough qualified drivers to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shortage got severe enough this past summer that Hunt had to park as many as 100 of its 4,150 trucks at a time . " That was just an indication that things would get worse , " says Kirk Thompson , Hunt 's president and chief executive officer since 1986 . <p> Shaken , the company raised pay from 25 cents a mile to an industry-record 28 cents a mile for drivers with three years ' experience . That 's as much as 4 cents more per mile than Hunt 's main competitors  --  privately held Schneider National Inc. of Green Bay , Wis. , and publicly traded Werner Enterprises , Inc. of Omaha  --  pay . Hunt drivers now average $32,000 a year , and top hands make as much as $50,000 . <p> Hunt has had to do more to attract drivers than increase their pay . Since 1985 the company has built 17 terminals , which serve mostly as homes away from home arid rest and relay stations for its drivers . The company says it now tries to get its drivers home every two weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every three weeks on average . For the last two years as well , Hunt has run a truck-driving school , offering free tuition and a job guaranteed upon graduation . <p> As a result , Thompson says he is now able to compete for drivers . But reaching this position has cost the company an additional $20 million a year in overhead . Thompson , a 37-year-old who quit school to do accounting work at Hunt and completed his accounting degree part time , says the tradeoff should eventually be less turnover , fewer accidents , lower recruiting expenses and no idled trucks . <p> Thompson thinks Hunt  --  which has maybe 3% of the truckload market  --  still has plenty of room to expand in the segment it currently serves . But to assure that revenue and earnings keep growing at 15% a year , Thompson is also expanding the company into new parts of the trucking business . <p> Last month , for example , Hunt bought Bulldog Trucking , an undercapitalized truckload carrier based in Carnesville , Ga . Bulldog is a short-hauler that specializes in 100-to-500-mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Hunt has never specialized in the short-haul business , although it accounts for as much as 40% of all big-rig business . The market is highly competitive , and Bulldog has been doing poorly . But Thompson hopes that Hunt 's economies of scale , capital and organizational network will all help the company develop its short-haul business . <p> Another Thompson departure : Until now , Hunt has operated only dry goods vans . But Thompson plans to begin flatbed service  --  good mainly for hauling building materials  --  next year . The idea here is quietly to develop a presence in the flatbed market , and then capitalize on it when the construction recession ends . <p> As he looks for new markets , Thompson does not lack for financial resources . Debt , at $100 million , is a low 35% of total capital . Fueled by heavy depreciation charges , cash flow is running at an annual rate of nearly $100 million , or $4.25 a share . <p> Thompson is the first to agree that J.B. Hunt is in for some rough times immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be difficult to negotiate in a recession . But none of this is any reason to fall asleep at the wheel . <p> " At some point , margins have to stabilize in the industry , and when they do , we 're going to do fine , " explains Thompson . In the meantime , he adds : " We wo n't go headlong into : the storm . We 'll make sure our wipers are working . But if we see a chance , we 're going to take it . " That 's how J.B. Hunt built his company , and how his young successor hopes to continue to build it . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hunt President and Chief Executive Officer Kirk Thompson " At some point margins have to stabilize in the industry , and they do , we 're going to do fine .
