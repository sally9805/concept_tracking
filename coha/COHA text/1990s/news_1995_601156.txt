<p> Practice does n't necessarily make perfect . <p> In an era when living together often is a prelude to marriage , evidence is mounting that the experience is no guarantee of wedded bliss . <p> In fact , if you live together before marriage , the odds that you will divorce are higher than if you had never shared the toothpaste beforehand . <p> " Almost all studies show a higher divorce rate for those who cohabit than those who do not , " says Jeffry Larson , Brigham Young University marital therapist , who has assessed all the most recent literature . " One study shows up to a 50% greater chance " of divorce . <p> That 's sobering news for the country 's 3 million opposite sex couples who are " unmarried partners with a close personal relationship , " in Census Bureau-speak . For many of them , cohabiting is intended to smooth the rough edges of the relationship in preparation for the Big Step . And the practice is getting more popular . <p> Even in today 's more conservative , traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one unmarried cohabiting couple for every 100 marrieds ; by 1993 , the most recent figures available , it was six per 100 marrieds . <p> " Cohabitation is the standard ; it is no longer a deviant activity at all , " says University of Wisconsin sociologist Larry Bumpass , one of America 's leading specialists on unmarried couples . The phenomenon is fueled by today 's attitudes toward premarital sex , he says , plus fears - sparked by the high divorce rate - that marriages do n't last . Ironically , living together is seen as a vaccination against divorce , a " confidence builder . " <p> It 's favored by younger folks : 1990 data show 41% of live-in partners are ages 24-34 . " It is clear , " Bumpass says , " public opinion will be even more tolerant in the future " as the next generation moves up with the same attitude . <p> Bumpass says most live-ins intend to marry , and 60% eventually do . Most such set-ups do n't endure ; couples either break up or marry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts disagree over the reasons for cohabiting 's dismal track record as a boost to marriage , but couples who 've been down that road have their own ideas . <p>  --  Harry Colburn , 49 , Southfield , Mich. , is not surprised by the stats . " I think it 's a real bad idea to live with somebody . You do n't really get the real person ; that little piece of paper makes a major difference in the commitment you make . " <p> If a couple moves in together " to test the waters , that is a red flag , " he says . " It is not the answer ; you are sending the message you have concerns right from the beginning . " <p> Feeling pressured to marry or move out , Colburn wed a woman he had lived with four months . They divorced . " Go with your gut feelings of what you feel comfortable with , " he cautions . " Things were not what they should have been , but I went forward thinking that would change . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they split . " Living together seems intuitively like a good idea . It gives you so many insights into the day-to-dayness of the other person 's personality , " says Johnston , 31 , Columbus , Ohio . But , she adds : " Because you are not married , I think it is easier to say , ' I 'm out of here . ' Small things , like who does the dishes , loom very large . " <p>  --  Ken Mollica , 30 , of Columbus , Ohio , says living together for seven months " sabotaged " his relationship . " It was the cleanliness thing . " He wanted things dusted ; she only required them to be straightened up . <p> But he would do it again : " You try on your ski boots before you go skiing , do n't you ? " <p>  --  But marital therapist Michele Weiner-Davis , 42 , Woodstock , Ill. , says she lived with her husband four years before their marriage in 1977 - and the splitsville statistics just baffle her . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 15 , were to tell me she was getting married and had NOT had that intense experience , I would be very concerned , " says Weiner- Davis , author of Divorce Busting ( Simon &; Schuster , $ 11 ) . <p>  --  And Joan Edelin , 49 , Gaithersburg , Md. , does n't worry her love boat is about to founder . She has lived-in for 14 years . " We share everything , all the trials and tribulations of marriage , except I do n't have his name legally . I was married once for 10 years , and that little piece of paper did n't keep us together . " <p> Why might living together cause divorce down the line ? It does n't , Bumpass insists . <p> Instead , the high rate of marital failure is due to the types of couples who set up premarital housekeeping today : non-traditionals more willing to divorce in the first place . And those insecure in the status of their relationship , but encouraged by a culture that increasingly says " try it out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture but before taking the vows ? Suddenly one partner can " feel a loss of personal freedom to exit out the back door , " Larson says . <p> Couples can also become disillusioned when the marriage is not bucolic even after a demonstration run . And those who choose to live in are often " those for whom long-term commitment is an issue . " <p> That is why Leslie Plahuta , 32 , Columbus , Ohio , " made sure I had that ( engagement ) ring " before living for nine months with Jamie , 30 . " I just wanted to make sure we were on the marriage track . " <p> She still did n't feel quite right about it . " My mother did n't tell her bridge group . She kinda wanted to keep it quiet , " she says . But her future husband " saw it as a testing ground . " And frankly - " It was the only way I could get him to marry me . " <p> But they both had the same goal - in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that is the key to satisfaction whether the relationship goes on to marriage or not , says Rosanne Rose , author of The Living Together Trap ( New Horizon , $ 12.95 ) . <p> " It is very important to have a mutual , clear-cut vision of what you want from the relationship . Why are you moving in ? To have more sex ? Because your clothes are already there ? To save money ? Or do you want to get married ? " <p> So many times , she says , the woman moves in because she thinks it will lead to marriage , but that may not be her man 's agenda at all . And before she gets hurt , " she should take off her rose-colored glasses . " <p> Marcella Wolfe-Gervais , 31 , Washington , D.C. , acknowledges , " I was the one taking the risk . I knew in my heart that we would probably get married , but I ca n't say that for him . " <p> She lived-in for 3 1/2 years before marrying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blind . You want to know more about the person you are marrying - how to deal with all his moods . And you learn a lot about yourself , too . " <p> Rose is adamant that couples get some sort of legal , live-in agreement that covers the nitty gritty issue : money . Many later rue investing big bucks together . Faunette Johnston regrets that she and her ex-live-in bought a house . " Do n't buy anything big together ! It is a nightmare , no different from going through a divorce . Just be very clear about what is whose . " <p> Weiner-Davis says she and her husband are atypical ; he wanted marriage more than she . And " for about a month after the wedding bells , I went into a funk of buyer 's remorse . " A child of divorce , she " was scared of having made the commitment . " <p> But her experience as a live-in stood her in good stead adjusting to marriage . " I 'm not saying living together is for everybody , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having done it this way . "
