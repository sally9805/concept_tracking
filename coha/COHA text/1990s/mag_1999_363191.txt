When the European Union proposed a plan to isolate and weaken Serbian strongman SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC by delivering heating oil directly to towns run by his opponents , U.S. diplomats were skeptical . They said the oil  --  which Serbia badly needs this winter because of the Western embargo  --  would either fail to reach its recipients or end up in Milosevic 's hands . <P> It turns out they were right . Last week Milosevic 's customs seized a convoy of trucks carrying some 350 tons of oil intended for Nis and Pirot , two opposition-run towns in southern Serbia . The convoy was stopped as soon as it crossed the border from Macedonia , and the two mayors , who came to meet it , were not even allowed to get near the trucks . <P> Meanwhile , the opposition-run areas complain that the state-run oil company refuses to give them any fuel at all . And Belgrade is saying it has solved the heating problem in the rest of the country by making deals with Slovakia and Iraq , exchanging Serbian copper , food and medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , it seems that the people most likely to shiver this winter are the ones who voted against Milosevic . <P>  --  By Dejan Anastasijevic and Andrew Purvis/Vienna
