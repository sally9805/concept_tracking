Expanding Greenwood/DTC shuttle bus routes , improving bicycle and pedestrian access to light rail stations and building additional under- or over-crossings of I-25 . <p> Controlling airport noise and burying massive DTC power lines are also concerns . <p> Dealing with Colorado 's growth : Infrastructure and comprehensive plans have to be in place early . <p> Should government at your level regulate land use ? <p> Yes . The first tier is the local control . The second is regional planning . <p> If government regulations diminish property values , should landowners be compensated ? <p> Property owners have vested rights through zoning regulations . To the extent that these rights are taken away they should be compensated accordingly . <p> Diane Maywhort <p> Position seeking : Greenwood Village City Council , District No. 2 <p> Occupation : Traditional homemaker/volunteer <p> Community involvement : Secretary , Greenwood Hills Homeowners Association ; Arapahoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Club <p> Qualifications/reasons for seeking office : I have been a domestic engineer and managed a small business ( my home ) for 31 years along with outside activities . Worked as corporate secretary , teacher 's aide , and medical assistant . <p> Key issues : <p> Traffic problems , growth in our city and surrounding communities and a partial loss of community resulting from the first two . We may have to find new solutions for the roads within our city used by outside commuters . I see mass transit and the widening of I-25 as one big answer . We will have to find other road solutions in cooperation with surrounding communities . With roads becoming more crowded , residents are discouraged from traveling to participate in community activities . Our free city bus service , the Link , may help cut traffic if used closer to neighborhoods . Although a community center might also help , excess funds for Greenwood Village projects alone may be limited for a while . <p> I strongly support Governor Owens ' efforts to widen and improve highways and the Regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that light rail will require a change in lifestyle for some Coloradans . <p> Should government at your level regulate land use ? <p> A reasonable amount of land-use regulation is necessary . <p> If government regulations diminish property values , should landowners be compensated ? <p> If a landowner is deprived of reasonable use of his/her property , then he/she should be compensated for its fair market value . <p> Anne Ingebretson <p> Position seeking : Greenwood Village City Council , District No. 2 <p> Occupation : Previously with IBM for 12 years in marketing and management .

Scheduled passenger service and the expansion of the east/west runway to accommodate larger jets are not appropriate . <p> Power lines : I support burying high-tension lines and smaller lines that run through our neighborhoods . This effort would best be accomplished through a citywide bond election or the establishment of a special district for supportive neighborhoods . <p> Should government at your level be involved in land-use regulation ? <p> Yes . <p> If government regulations diminish property values , should landowners be compensated ? <p> Landowners should not be compensated unless property values are diminished as the result of a ' taking ' where the legal right of eminent domain has been exercised . <p> Karen Blilie <p> Position seeking : Greenwood Village City Council , District No. 3 <p> Occupation : Private tutoring practice for reading-disabled students <p> Community involvement : Planning and zoning commissioner ; charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Citizens Advisory Committee to Centennial Airport <p> Qualifications/reasons for seeking office : Much city involvement <p> Key issues : <p> Transportation : We enjoy the tax base the Denver Tech Center and other businesses provide but complain about the traffic .

We need collaboration with RTD to provide express buses to the Tech Center . <p> Centennial Airport : The airport needs to get along with its neighbors and continued expansion and increased air traffic do not serve that need . <p> Community center : In a survey , many residents said they felt a sense of community was important , but some believed it was lacking in Greenwood Village . Many people stated the desire for a community center or a city center , a local gathering place . Issues include funding and location . <p> Dealing with Colorado 's growth : Unrestricted growth results in chaos while overcontrol sets up dictatorship .

Do nothing unless a more credible analysis proves need . Then put a new spillway in the middle of the dam instead of raising anything . <p> Traffic : Belleview , Dayton and Union streets must be redesigned to provide better traffic flow and discourage their use as highways . <p> Transportation : Mass transit rail is clearly needed in the southeast corridor now , where we have more retail and total business than downtown Denver . <p> More lanes on southeast I-25 are vital to eliminate gridlock . <p> Should government at your level regulate land use ? <p> Each municipal entity should have a clear plan on land use and zoning .
