<p> Interest rates have been falling as the economy slows . That 's good news for borrowers but , so far , not too painful for savers and investors . <p> Home buyers are cheering the lowest mortgage rates since March ' 94 . But savers are watching yields on certificates of deposit fall . And bond investors , who 've made a year 's worth of returns in five months , are wondering if the good times will end soon . <p> Dennis Cralley , 54 , is convinced they will . He intends to sell his Colonial bond fund . Its yield is down more than a percentage point to 6.4% from a year ago . But after losing 2.5% last year , including interest payments , Colonial has posted a total return of 8.1% so far this year . " I want to at least come close to breaking even , " says Cralley , a warehouse manager at a Phoenix fire protection firm . <p> Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions . There 's been a stampede to buy bonds among investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slows . They have been bidding up bond prices as they rush to lock in today 's interest rates - driving bond yields down . <p> As yields slide , some investors in bond funds have bailed out , happy - like Cralley - to take profits from this year 's huge share price gains . <p> Increasingly , economists believe the economy may slow to a crawl - or even tip into recession - missing the soft landing that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is trying to engineer . The Fed has boosted short-term interest rates seven times since February 1994 to keep inflation under control by slowing the economy . <p> Inflation is a fixed-income investor 's greatest fear : It erodes the value of bonds and the fixed interest they pay . But investors are n't worrying about inflation now . Instead , they 're worried the Fed has gone too far - and may need to cut short-term interest rates to keep the economy rolling . " There 's a 45% chance of a recession starting late this year or early next year and a 55% chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest . <p> What 's the outlook for borrowers , savers and investors ? : <p> Borrowers <p> The biggest beneficiaries of the rate slide are home buyers . The average 30-year fixed mortgage - which moves in tandem with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds - dived to 7.71% last week from 9.25% in December . And it 's expected to fall again this week as the bond rally continues . Every quarter-point drop means a home buyer can qualify for $ 3,000 more in a mortgage , according to rate tracker HSH Associates . <p> The drop since December cuts $ 163 a month from payments on a $ 150,000 mortgage . Plunging rates spurred Clyde and Colleen McQueen to act . A month ago , the Seattle couple were n't even thinking about moving . Tuesday , they locked in a 30-year mortgage at 7 3/4% on a $ 400,000 home - before selling their current home . " Because of the fall in rates , we can afford a nicer home , " says Clyde , 36 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage rates have fallen , they 've become relatively more attractive than adjustable rates , which averaged 5.95% last week . And because of last year 's rise in interest rates , many people with ARMs have seen their rates bumped up 2 full percentage points this year - above the current fixed-rate average . That 's ignited refinancings , as people dump ARMs for lower fixed-rate mortgages . The average 15-year mortgage has fallen to 7.24% from 8.87% in January . <p> The timing could n't be better for the mortgage industry : Last week , Chicago Title Insurance said it would lay off 300 employees because home sales have been so slow . Refinancings - 20% of all mortgages - are still well off the frenzy of 1993 and 1994 . But mortgage applications are up 9% from a month ago and 23% from a year ago , the Mortgage Bankers Association says . Rourke O'Brien , CEO at QPoint Mortgage in Seattle , says , " Business is up threefold since February . " <p> " Falling rates are throwing a lifeline to the housing market and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economist at the National Association of Realtors . <p> What does the future hold ? Keith Gumbinger tracks mortgage rates daily as an analyst at HSH Associates in Butler , N.J. He believes rates now are as low as they 'll get all summer . He plans to lock in a 30-year mortgage at 7 1/2% on a new house . Two months ago , the rate was 8 3/4% . " Anyone who wants to gamble on the market is a fool , " he says . <p> Some economists believe mortgage rates could fall further , possibly pushing the average below 7.5% by September . Most , however , do n't expect to see the average hit the 25-year low of 6.74% in October 1993 . And " by late summer , they could start to turn upward again , " says MBA chief economist David Lereah . <p> Unlike mortgages , rates for consumer loans and credit cards have been stuck in neutral . Why ? They 're tied to banks ' prime lending rate , which has been at 9% since early February . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January , Bank Rate Monitor says . And the average credit-card rate has risen to 18.2% from 17.7% . <p> Investors <p> So far , 1995 has been good to stock and bond investors . But if the economy stops dead , corporate profits will fall , unemployment will rise - and the markets could stumble . <p> Almost daily , the stock market has been marching to new highs - convincing many that a correction is overdue . The Dow Jones industrial average is up 17% this year . The average general stock mutual fund is up 13% . The average bond fund is up 7% , including interest payments and share price appreciation . Some bond funds have posted double-digit gains . <p> But fixed-income investors are seeing their monthly interest payments slip . The yield on the average bond fund is 6.8% , down from 7.3% in October . That 's still up from 6.1% a year ago , but investors like Cralley are getting out - and putting their profits in money market funds to protect them . Since January , investors have sold $ 7.4 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may be smart . " The economy is not showing the kind of weakness needed to justify a bond rally like this , " says Chip Norton , editor at Bond Fund Report . <p> Savers <p> Knowing what to do may be harder for savers . The average yield on a one-year certificate of deposit is 5.52% , vs. the recent peak of 5.86% in February . But the average is still well above what it was a year ago - 3.78% . <p> That 's enough yield for Massoud Rostam-Abadi and his wife Chong-Hwey of Champaign , Ill . They 're expecting a chunk of cash from the sale of a $ 250,000 home he jointly inherited from his parents . <p> Most of that money is going straight into short-term bank CDs , where the principal is guaranteed . " We 'll wait a while to see what the stock market does , " says Massoud , 44 , an engineering professor at the University of Illinois . <p> Robert Heady , publisher of newsletter Bank Rate Monitor , believes that 's the safest bet . CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fed . And they wo n't fall much until the Fed cuts short-term rates to stimulate the economy . If the economy starts showing signs of strength , rates could stop sliding or rebound by late summer . And if that happens , savers in short-term CDs or money market funds can roll their money into higher-yielding accounts . <p> Of course , if the economy slams into a recession , they 'll wish they had locked in five-year CDs , now averaging 6.14% . <p> " I would n't want to be Alan Greenspan for a million bucks right now , " Heady says . " He 's going to have to be the next Superman to pull this off .
