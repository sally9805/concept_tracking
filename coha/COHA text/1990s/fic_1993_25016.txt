 | Hadley Patterson turned to see if someone was standing behind her , but there was no one there . Josh Carter , the new boy in the sixth grade at Possum Hollow School , must have been talking to her . " What did you say ? " she asked . Josh 's freckled face turned red , right to the roots of his reddish blond hair . " I said Oh , forget it , " he mumbled . He started to walk away . Hadley , flustered , almost let him . But had he said what she thought he 'd said ? " Wait a second , " Hadley called timidly after him across the playground . " Did you ask me if I wanted to come over after school ? " Josh turned back . " Yeah , " he said carefully . " That 's what I thought , but I was n't sure , " said Hadley . " But it 's no big deal , " Josh said quickly . " Well , " said Hadley , not sure now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want me to come over ? " " Sure , " answered Josh with a shrug . " Okay , " said Hadley . " Really ? " asked Josh . His face lost its careful look , and a smile curled the corners of his mouth . " Today ? " 1  | " Sure , " said Hadley . " Great ! " said Josh . " But do n't you have to call your mom and ask ? " Hadley laughed shortly and shook her head . Three months before , Hadley 's mother had been moved up from waitress to hostess at the Sheldrake Inn . The pay was a lot better , but Mrs. Patterson worked much longer hours than she 'd ever worked as a waitress . " My mom works late , " Hadley explained . " What about your dad ? " asked Josh . Hadley looked hard at Josh to see if he was making fun of her . Her father was n't around , had n't been since she was three years old . But Josh was new in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , she decided that he was merely being friendly . " I do n't have a dad , " she said , trying to sound matter-of-fact . " I mean , I do , but he does n't live around here . " " Oh , " said Josh . There was an awkward silence . " Hey , " Josh said , brightening , " if your mom wo n't be home until late , maybe you can stay for dinner . That is , if you can stand my little brother , Simon , and his dumb jokes . " Hadley smiled . She liked the idea of staying for dinner . She was getting pretty tired of the instant macaroni-and-cheese suppers she 'd been fixing herself , with an occasional chicken potpie or can of Chef Boyardee ravioli thrown in to break the monotony . Hadley 's mother kept saying , " Next time I have a day off , I 'm going to teach 2  | you how to cook some decent meals . " But when the days off actually came , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopped quickly , piling the same blue-and-yellow boxes of macaroni and cheese , the same red cans of ravioli , and the same frozen chicken pies into their cart . Hadley thought she could probably make something better . How hard could it be to open a cookbook and follow the directions ? But she just could n't get interested in doing all that work to make food that only one person was going to eat . Having a real meal at Josh 's house sounded wonderful . " I 'll meet you outside Mrs. Dorsey 's room after school , " she offered , as the bell rang for the end of recess . " Okay , " said Josh . Mrs. Dorsey was Josh 's homeroom teacher . Hadley had Mr. Wolf , but everybody switched for reading and math , and she and Josh were both in Miss Cole 's reading class . Hadley was surprised that Josh had invited her over . She saw him only in reading class , so she did n't know him very well . She knew that he liked reading , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing stories , especially mysteries . She knew that Josh 's father was the new dentist in town , and that Josh 's family had moved to town when old Dr. Hart retired . Hadley had gone to see Dr. Carter and found out she needed braces . Josh seemed okay , and it would be fun to have somebody to play with after school for a change . 3  | Hadley still missed her best friend , Alison Belker , who had moved away in the middle of the summer . Since school started , Hadley had become friendlier with some of the other girls in her class , but it was n't the same as with Alison . The idea of spending the afternoon with Josh was a lot better than spending it alone , as Hadley had been expecting to do . " See you after school , " she called to Josh as she hurried down the hall to her classroom . 4  | When school let out , Hadley and Josh walked across the school yard , surrounded by groups of laughing , running , screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a group of younger children who were carrying cutouts of jack-o ' - lanterns , black cats , and witch hats . The children had made them in art class , Hadley knew , because she had made the same things when she 'd been in first grade . Some of the kids were chanting in spooky voices , trying to scare the others , who listened , wide-eyed : " The horrible hag of Hogback Hill , If she does n't get you , her black cats will .... " Josh laughed . " What are those kids talking about ? " he asked Hadley . " Oh , nothing , really , " answered Hadley . " Just the hag . " " Who 's the hag ? " asked Josh . And where 's Hogback Hill ? " " There , " said Hadley , pointing ahead to a steep , rocky hill that loomed high above them on the other side of town . " But nobody ever goes up there . " 5  | The younger children kept singing : " The horrible hag lives all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone .... " " Some kind of monster lives up there ? " asked Josh , looking curiously toward the top of Hogback Hill . Hadley raised her eyebrows and shrugged . " Depends who you ask , " she said . " She waits for a knock upon her door , But those who knock are seen no more .... " The children stopped chanting and , giggling nervously , they , too , looked at Hogback Hill . " The hag of Hogback Hill ? " repeated Josh . " Is this for real ? " " I take it you have n't met Angus ' lull yet , " replied Hadley . " Who 's Angus Tull ? " asked Josh , looking confused . " Angus is an old guy who lives here in town , " explained Hadley . " Ile scares kids by telling us stories about the hag . He teaches little kids those rhymes , and they pass them around and scare each other to death . I used to have the worst nightmares because of him . " " But you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't answer right away . She thought how , just the night before , she had lain in bed , hardly daring to breathe , staring out her window at the outline of Hogback Hill against the sky . How she had listened to the hooting of owls and the howling of coyotes and the sighing of the wind as it passed through the stunted 6  | branches of the trees that struggled to grow on the hill 's steep , rocky slopes . How she had seen the light again , flickering at the very top . Someone was up there ; she was sure of it . " I do n't know , " she answered honestly . " I mean , some of the stories are crazy . Angus says a hunchback lives up there , with a body all twisted and shriveled up , just like her heart . ' He says she lives all alone except for hundreds of black cats , and that if you go up there she turns you into a cat and you 're never seen again . " " Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obvious question is : Did anybody ever actually get turned into a cat ? " Hadley could see that Josh was really interested , but she did n't want to talk about it . She had told Josh she used to have nightmares about Hogback Hill . The truth was that now that her mother worked late and she was alone in the house at night , the old bad dreams she 'd had as a little kid had been coming back . The twisted shape of Hogback Hill filled her bedroom window , and the horrid image of a misshapen , witchlike woman filled her dreams . The woman reached out her arms to Hadley , beckoning with long , bony fingers . " Come , " she called . " Come to me . " And Hadley would awaken , tangled in the covers , her heart pounding , forehead sweaty , eyes staring into the darkness . She shuddered , remembering . " Angus says his friend , Clarence Cuthbert , got turned into a cat , " Hadley replied . " But I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would Angus make it up ? " Josh asked . Hadley shrugged . It was a good question . " I guess he just likes to scare kids . " " So you 've never been up there ? " asked Josh . " No , " replied Hadley , " but it 's not because I 'm afraid of being turned into a black cat . " " Then why do n't you go ? " Josh persisted . " II do n't know , " answered Hadley . " None of the kids go there . Maybe you have to know Angus . He can really give you the willies . " She paused , then decided to tell Josh the rest . " And , well , Hogback Hill is right behind my house . I can see it clearly from my bedroom window , probably better than anyone . " She paused . " I think somebody is up there . " Josh lifted his eyebrows . " Sometimes I see a light at the top . " Josh 's eyebrows lifted even higher , and Hadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern or a candle , because there 's no electricity up there . And the light flickers . It 's not steady like a flash-light . " " You mean you think somebody lives there ? " asked Josh . " I do n't know , " said Hadley . " But whenever it 's clear enough , and dark enough , I see the light . " She did n't tell Josh how frightened she felt when she saw it , how all of Angus Tull 's stories suddenly seemed real . " Why would anyone want to live up there all alone ? " Josh wondered . " I do n't know , " answered Hadley . And even if someone did live up there , would n't sheor hehave to come down sometimes ? And then everybody would 8  | know who it was , " said Hadley . She had thought about all this before , lying in her bed at night , unable to sleep , waiting for the sound of her mother 's key in the door . It just did n't make sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were interrupted by the tooting of a car horn . A blue station wagon pulled up alongside them , and a boy about five years old yelled out the window , " Hi , Josh ! Is that your girlfriend ? " For the second time that day , Hadley watched Josh 's freckled face turn bright red , right to the tips of his cars . She felt sorry for him . She blushed easily , too , and she hated it . Her hair was dark brown , not reddish like Josh 's , but she had the same light , freckled skin that turned red at the drop of a hat . It was n't fair to have a face that advertised your feelings to the whole world . To make matters worse , Hadley had grown so much during the summer that she towered over all the boys in the sixth grade , including Josh . Of course , everyone in the sixth grade was taller than Josh . Hadley thought of how they must look , walking down the street together , the top of Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend ? If she kept growing like this , she 'd never be anybody 's girlfriend . Another voice called from the driver 's seat . " Hop in , Josh . " " That 's okay , Mom , " said Josh . " We 're almost home . We 'll walk . Hadley 's coming home with me , okay ? " " Certainly , " said Mrs. Carter , smiling at Hadley . " Nice to meet you , Hadley . " 9  | " Nice to meet you , too , " said Hadley . " We 'll see you in a few minutes then , " said Mrs. Carter , pulling away from the curb . Josh looked apologetically at Hadley . " Do n't pay any attention to Simon , " he said . " You know what little brothers are like . " " Not really , " said Hadley . " I do n't have any brothers or sisters . " " Lucky you , " said Josh . " Well , here 's my house . Enter at your own risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pizza cross the road ? " demanded Simon as Josh and Hadley walked into the kitchen . " Oh , no , here he goes . " Josh moaned . " He 's on this riddle kick , except he does n't really understand what a riddle is . He just asks a dumb question and gives an even dumber answer . Mom , make him stop , will you ? " " I do n't think Hadley would mind one little riddle , " said Mrs. Carter . " Would you , Hadley ? " " No , " answered Hadley . She turned to Simon . " I do n't know , Simon . To get to the other side ? " " No ! " cried Simon triumphantly . " It did n't know it was a pizza ! " " See what I mean , " said Josh . " Dumb ! " " That 's a good riddle , " said Hadley . " Did you make it up ? " Simon nodded . " You want to hear another one ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do n't encourage him , or you 'll be sorry , I guarantee it . " Mrs. Carter was putting away groceries . " I 'm so glad ou could come over , Hadley . It has n't been easy for 11  | Josh , moving away from his old school and his pals and coming to Possum Hollow . I keep telling him it takes a while to make new friends , but here it is the end of October , and you 're the first person who 's been to visit . Of course , it 's hard for Josh with his asthma . Sports seem to be so important to boys this age , and Josh has to be very careful . " " Mom ! " Josh protested , embarrassed . " Make me sound like the dork of the world , why do n't you ? " Hadley spoke quickly . " It does take time to get to know people around here . " Josh threw her a grateful look . " I understand you and Josh are in the same reading class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hadley , surprised that Josh had talked about her to his mother . " Miss Cole 's great . " " That 's what Josh tells me , " said Mrs. Carter . " Not like Mrs. Dorsey , " said Josh , making a face . Then , imitating his teacher , he said in a high-pitched , sorrowful voice , And now , class , I want you to put your heads down and think for a moment about the way you 've been behaving . " " Josh , " said his mother , " that 's no way to talk . " Hadley could n't help laughing . " That 's just how she sounds . " " You should hear her do n't spin your books ' lec-ture , " Josh continued . " The first day of school , when she handed out our science and social studies books , she said , Now , children , do n't ever let me see you spin your books . ' We did n't know what she was talking 12  | about . So she put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her finger in the middle of it , and spun it around . Do n't ever do this , ' she said . I mean , we 'd never even have thought of doing that . But now we do it all the time . It drives her crazy ! " " Josh , " said his mother , " I hope you 're not doing any such thing . " " Right , Mom , " said Josh , grabbing two apples and a hag of corn chips from the counter . " We 're going up to my room for a while . Oh , and is it okay if Hadley stays for dinner ? " " Is it all right with your mother ? " Mrs. Carter asked I Hadley . " Shall I call her ? " " It 's okay ; you do n't have to call her , " said Hadley . " Thank you . " " Well , we 're glad to have you , Hadley . " Upstairs , Josh carefully locked the door to his room . Anti-Simon device , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute , " said Hadley , munching a handful of corn chips . Your mom 's nice , too . " " Yeah , " agreed Josh . " She 's okay . She worries too much , though , about whether I have friends and stuff like that . She was really glad to see you , in case you could n't tell . " " You 're lucky , " said Hadley . " My mom does n't like me to have kids over . She says I ca n't have anybody over when she 's not home , which is just about all the time , and when it 's her day off and she is home , she says she needs some peace and quiet . " " Jeez , my mom 's been driving me crazy , bugging me 13  | to have somebody over . But , I do n't know , it seems like everybody already has all the friends they want . Plus I have this stupid asthma , so I ca n't play soccer or football or anything . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , " said Hadley . " I was , " admitted Josh . They ate for a moment in silence . " So , anyway , " Josh continued , " about Hogback Hilldo you really think there 's somebody up there ? " " Some nights I 'm sure of it , " said Hadley . " So when can I meet this Angus Tull and hear all his stories for myself ? " Angus will talk to anyone who 'll listenabout the hag , anyway . But I do n't see why you 'd want to meet him . He 's weird . Scary . " " Well , if I 'm going to live in Possum Hollow , I 've got to know what 's going on . I want to hear all about the hagright from Angus himself ! " declared Josh . " You want to go tomorrow ? " " Well ... " said Hadley , stalling . She did n't really want to see Angus Tull , but she did n't want to disappoint Josh , either . Simon 's voice came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Go away , " said Josh . " Mom says it 's time to come down and set the table for dinner , so you have to open the door , " insisted Simon . " Okay , " said Josh . " Come on , Hadley . My dad must be home . " 14  | On the way down the stairs , Simon whispered to Hadley , " What 's gray and has four legs and a trunk ? " Hadley had heard that one before , but she pretended she had n't . " I do n't know , " she said . " An elephant ? " " An elephant on vacation ! " crowed Simon . " Simon ! " said Josh in exasperation . " It 's a mouse on vacation . You mess up everything . " Hadley laughed , and that seemed to be all that mattered to Simon . He laughed , too , quite pleased with the effect of his joke . Sitting at the dining-room table with the Carters made Hadley feel as if she were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dr. Carter was handsome and full of good humor . They ate a meal that Hadley was sure would meet the approval of the school nurse , who was always talking about food groups and the importance of proper nutrition , and everyone sat at the table together , talking and laughing . At the moment , the topic of discussion was Halloween , which was two nights away . " Dad , you 're not going to dress up like a woman again , are you ? " asked Josh . " Well , of course , " answered Dr. Carter . Josh made a face at Hadley . " He does this every year . " I thought dentists did n't like Halloween , " said f Hadley , " because of kids eating tons of candy and rotting their teeth and all . " " Not me , " said Josh 's father cheerfully . " He hands out toothbrushes and sugarless gum , " Josh told Hadley . 15  | " You be sure and come over Halloween night , " said Dr. Carter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress . " " And matching heels , " added Mrs. Carter with a laugh . Hadley smiled , imagining Josh 's tall , skinny father walking in high heels . And I 'm going to be a skeleton ! " said Simon . " Mom sewed the neatest costumes for us , " Josh explained to Hadley . " They 're made from black stretchy material , and the bones of the human body are sewn on the outside . They 're made of this silvery stuff . " " Yeah , " interrupted Simon , " but the best part is , in the dark they glow green ! " " What are you going to be , Hadley ? " asked Dr. Carter . " I do n't know , " answered Hadley . " Last year I made myself a pretty good wizard 's costume . I 'll probably wear that if it still fits . " " You can go trick-or-treating with us ! " said Simon . " Thanks , " said Hadley . After dinner Hadley and Josh helped with the dishes . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back for supper on Saturday night and bring your mother . I 'd like to meet her . " " Oh , thank you , " said Hadley , " but my mom will be working . Saturday night is her real late night . Sometimes she does n't get home until one or two o'clock . " Mrs. Carter 's eyes widened . " What do you do when she 's at work ? Does someone come to stay with you ? " 16  | " No , " said Hadley . " I stay by myself . I 'm okay . " Hadley could tell that Josh 's mother wanted to ask more questions , and Hadley hoped she would n't . She did n't want Mrs. Carter to think she had a terrible mother or anything like that . " It 's okay , really . I 'm used to it , " she said . " Well , I 'd better be getting home now , " she finished . " Thank you for dinner . " " You 're very welcome , " said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come another time . " " Maybe , " said Hadley . Josh walked Hadley part of the way home . " You go to sleep all alone in your house ? " he asked curiously . " Yeah , " answered Hadley . Are n't you scared ? " For a moment , Hadley considered telling the truth . It was the kind of thing she 'd have told Alison , who would have understood . But she did n't really know Josh . He might thing she was a baby . " Not really , " she lied . " I 'm used to it . " " Wow , " said Josh . Hadley could hear the admiration in his voice Hadley did n't say anything . " So tomorrow we 'll go see Angus ? " asked Josh . Are you sure you want to ? " Hadley replied . Josh nodded eagerly . " Do n't you ? " Hadley shook her head . " Not really . I do n't like him . " " Come on , " urged Josh . " It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agreed Hadley . She did n't want Josh to think she was scared . Not when he seemed so  | impressed by her staying alone . And she was n't scarednot exactly . When they were halfway to Hadley 's house , Josh said , " I 'd better head back . " " Okay , " said Hadley . " Thanks for dinner . " " See you tomorrow , " said Josh . " Bye . " While walking the rest of the way home , she thought about Angus Tull . She was n't looking forward to seeing him again , but Josh had swept her along with his enthusiasm . And , she had to admit , it was kind of fun being the one who knew what was going on , filling in " the new kid . " She liked the way Josh 's face got all excited-looking when she told him about the hag of Hogback Hill . She liked his family , too . Even Simon , she thought , smiling to herself . She promised herself she 'd go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon the next time she saw him .  | As Hadley let herself into the house with the key she wore around her neck , the first thing she noticed was how quiet it was . Coming from Josh 's house , where there was so much talk and laughter , her house seemed more empty than usual . She did n't have any homework , so she switched on the television . She watched a few minutes of a show t hat was supposed to be about a typical family , but the Parents acted like idiots and the kids talked back to them all the time . " Dumb , " she said out loud . She turned it off . It was pretty late . She decided to get ready for bed and read for a while . She checked the front and back doors to make sure they were locked , washed her face and brushed her teeth , and got into bed with her book . It was a good hook , but tonight she could n't concentrate on it . She kept thinking about Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , that despite what Josh said , it would be nice to have a little brother or sister . She did n't think Josh minded Simon as much as he said he did . If I had a little brother , Hadley reasoned , Mom  | would have to be home more , like she was when I was little . When Mrs. Patterson had taken the hostess job at the Sheldrake , she had said , " You 're old enough now to be on your own more and , goodness knows , we can use the money . You 'll be okay in the evenings until I get home , wo n't you , honey ? " And Hadley had said yes , she 'd be fine . What could she tell her mother nowthat she was n't fine , that maybe she was n't old enough to be on her own ? Besides , her mother liked her new job . It was much easier than waitressing , she said , and people treated her with more respect . And they did need the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that . She did n't want crooked teeth the rest of her life , did she ? So she did n't say anything to her mother about the long , dark nights when she lay in her bed , stiffening at every sound , watching the strange shadows that moved on her bedroom wall . She did n't tell her mother how much she missed the evenings they used to spend together after work and school , when Mrs. Patterson propped her tired feet on the coffee table and Hadley read out loud . She did n't say anything about how awful the weekends were . Saturday was a big day at the Sheldrake , and they needed Hadley 's mother to keep the customers flowing happily through the restaurant , and of course there was Sunday brunch . Mrs. Patterson 's days off came more and more often during the week , when  | Hdley was at school , and since Mrs. Patterson worried about Hadley having friends over when she was n't home , the weekends dragged endlessly . It would n't be so bad if Alison were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time that Hadley 's mother had taken the new job . The nights were the worst . Many nights Hadley did n't sleep at all , waiting for her mother to come home . Like tonight . Hadley stared out the window . The moon was close to being full and , in its light , she saw the dark outline of Hogback Hill against the sky . She sat up suddenly as , once again , a faint light flickered near the top of the hill . She got out of bed and stood at the window , looking tip . She had the sudden , peculiar feeling that whoever was there was looking down at that very moment , watching her as she stood at her bedroom window . A shiver ran down her spine . " Who are you ? " she wondered , and was surprised to hear herself speaking out loud . " And what are you doing , all by yourself , on I Hgback Hill ? " Her only answer was the light as it gave one last flicker and went out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's bedroom . Mrs. Patterson was lying across the bed , sleeping deeply . She had n't even gotten into her nightgown , but had fallen into bed in her slip . She looked exhausted . Hadley was supposed to wake her mother so that they could have breakfast together . But she knew her mother had come in after midnight the night before . Mrs. Patterson did n't have to be at work until noon . Why disturb her ? Quietly , Hadley ate breakfast , got dressed , and slipped out the door . During reading class , Josh slipped Hadley a note . It said , " Meet me by the swings after school . Do n't tell anyone where we 're going ! Josh . " Hadley turned around to see Josh 's eager , excited face grinning at her . She grinned back . It was fun , the way Josh was making such a big , daring expedition out of going to see Angus Tull . When school let out , Hadley found Josh waiting for her , full of ideas and plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Hadley nodded .  | And nobody knows we 're going there , right ? " Hadley nodded again . " So , " said Josh proudly , " I left a note in my desk telling the date and our destination . That way , if something happens to us , like if this Angus Tull decides to murder us or something , there will be some clues left behind for the police to follow " " Josh , you 're nuts , " said Hadley nervously . " Nobody 's going to murder us . What are you talking about ? " " Hadley , you 're the one who did n't want to go see this guy cause he 's so weird . I 'm just trying to take proper precautions . That 's what you do when you 're t ricking down a mystery . Now , did you or did you not say Angus is a creep ? " " Yes , but I did n't say he was a murderer . " " Okay , okay . I 'm just trying to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloween , and we 're going to the house of a nutty old man , tracking down the story of a hag who turns people into black cats . It 's perfect ! " " Perfect , " agreed Hadley sarcastically . " I ca n't believe you talked me into this . " " Let 's go before you chicken out , " said Josh . " I 'm not chickening out ! " said Hadley . " Then let 's go , " said Josh . " Lead the way . " Angus lives on the other side of town , " said Hadley , " sort of near me . " " Near Hogback Hill , " added Josh in a mysterious voice .  | " Yeah , " said Hadley . " What are we going to do , just go up and knock on his door ? " asked Josh . " I guess so , " answered Hadley . " I 've never done this before . Usually people try to avoid Angus . They do n't go looking for him . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably , " said Hadley . " We do n't want him to get suspicious , " mused Josh . " Suspicious about what ? " asked Hadley . " About us going up Hogback Hill , of course , " answered Josh . " Josh ! " said Hadley , stopping dead . " I said I 'd take you to see Angus . I never said anything about going up Hogback Hill . " " Okay , okay , " said Josh soothingly . " One thing at a time . First we go to see Angus . " " We go to see Angus , and that 's it , " said Hadley , with what she hoped sounded like the last word on the subject . " There , that 's his house . The one with the unmowed grass . " " Wow , " Josh said softly . " It even looks like a haunted house . " Hadley had n't paid any attention to Angus 's house for a long time . She did n't have to walk past it , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of Hogback Hill . But now , looking at it through Josh 's eyes , she could see that he was right . The house had a run-down , uncared-for look , as if no one lived there at all . Untrimmed bushes and shrubs grew over the filthy  | windows , and vines climbed over the porch , almost covering an old rocking chair that sat on the uneven wooden planks . The stairs were crooked , with one missing . The house looked dark and empty . She could certainly see how Josh would think it looked like a haunted house . " The place looks deserted . He still lives here , does n't he ? " whispered Josh . ' As far as I know , " Hadley whispered back . She tried to remember the last time she had seen Angus . She did n't know when it had been , but she could picture him , walking down the street toward her , carrying a hat ; of groceries under each arm . " What do you think we should do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered Hadley . As they pproached Angus 's house , the sun disappeared chind a cloud , making the late autumn afternoon ark and suddenly chilly . That , together with all the whispering , was making her nervous . " Knock on the our , I guess , " she said loudly . " Shhhhhh , " said Josh , his fingers to his lips . " Josh , you 're getting me spooked . Why should we c quiet ? When we knock on the door , he 'll know we 're here . I mean , you do want to talk to him , right ? ; is n't that the idea ? " " Yeah , " said Josh . " Okay , are you ready ? Let 's go . " They climbed the crooked stairs , avoiding the missig step . Josh pointed to an ancient brass door knocker the shape of a winged lion . He was lifting the lion 's  | head to knock when a black cat streaked out of the bushes and ran across the porch by their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a loud clang . Hadley held her hand over her mouth . She felt like a fool for screaming . Josh looked at her , wide-eyed . " Black cat ! " he said , grinning . " Wonder who that used to be ? " Hadley giggled . " Josh , do n't be dumb . " All at once they heard slow , heavy footsteps approaching from inside the house . The curtain on the door was pulled aside , and they caught a glimpse of a frowning face , eyes squinting from under bristly white eyebrows . The eyes , a startling blue , stared at them for a long moment . Then the curtain fell back into place and the door opened . Angus Tull stood before them , scowling fiercely . " Well ? " he asked flatly . Hadley wished that she and Josh had thought more about what they were going to say . She supposed she had to speak first since , although she did n't think Angus knew who she was , Josh was a total stranger . Her heart was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush starting to creep up her neck to her face . Josh did n't seem inclined to speak , so she began . " Mr. Tull ? " " Who 'd you expect ? I live here , do n't I ? " he said abruptly . " Yes , sir . Uh , that 's why we came . I 'm Hadley Patterson , and this is my friend , Josh Carter . He "  | " He the one who tried to knock my door down ? " asked Angus . " Yes , " answered Hadley , " I mean , no . I mean , he did n't mean to " " It just kind of slipped , " Josh explained quickly . Angus snorted . That appeared to be all he was going to say , so Hadley continued . " Well , sir , Josh is new in town , and I was telling him about , well , about the hag of Hogback Hill , and " " What about her ? " Angus interrupted again . The attention of the hag seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saythat she turns people into cats and all , " Hadley stumbled on , never knowing when Angus was going to jump into the conversation . " You stay away from there , or the same thing will happen to you , " Angus said suddenly , turning for the first time to Josh and giving him a penetrating stare . " It will ? " asked Josh , startled into speaking . " You do n't believe me ? " snapped Angus . " Stupid boy . Clarence Cuthbert did n't believe me , either , and look what happened to him . " " What happened ? " asked Josh . His bravado seemed to have disappeared , Hadley noticed . He looked the way she felt around Angusnervous and scared . Well , his was what Josh had come to find out . Hadley had no doubt he 'd hear the whole story now . " In here , " said Angus , stepping away from the door end disappearing into the house . Josh and Hadley looked at each other .  | " Does he want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Looks like it , " said Hadley . " My mother would kill me if she thought I went into a strange house like this , " Josh whispered . " Mine , too , " answered Hadley . " Come on , let 's get out of here . " She grabbed Josh 's hand . " We ca n't just walk away , " said Josh . " Come on , " urged Hadley . " Why not ? " " It would be rude , " answered Josh . " Rude ! What about him ? " said Hadley . " Come on , let 's leave . I do n't want to go in there . I 'll tell you the whole story myself later . " " Wait . I want to hear what happened . From Angus . Come on . It 's why we came . Please , Hadley ? It 'll be okay . What can he do to us ? " Hadley could think of several things , none of which she wanted to dwell on at the moment . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh 's excitement . All right , " she said . " Just leave the door open so we can make a quick getaway if we have to . " They walked through the door , into the gloomy house . " And shut the door ! " shouted Angus . Josh looked at Hadley and shrugged . Hadley rolled her eyes . Together they headed in the direction of Angus 's voice . At first they did n't see him sitting on the sofa , the room was so dark . He waved at the floor , which they took to mean that that was where they were supposed to sit . When they were seated , Angus began , " If you 're  | smart , you 'll listen to what I say . There 's things that happen in this world that ca n't be explained . Things that would make your blood run cold . What goes on up there on that hill you 'd be better off never knowing about . So I 'll tell you what happened to my friend , Clarence Cuthbert , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep you away from Hogback Hill , then you 're stupider than I think you are . " Angus fixed Josh , then Hadley , with an appraising look before he continued . " Now Clarence , as I say , was my friend . So I told him what I 'm telling you . Stay away from that place . No good can come of going up there . But Clarence was stubborn and foolish and he did n't listen to me . He 'd heard my warnings , but he did n't believe . He was looking for excitement , adventure . The fool . " Here Angus stopped and fixed Josh with his fierce gaze . Josh squirmed uncom-fortably . Angus snorted in disgust and continued . " So one morning I woke up to a peculiar sound out there , " said Angus , nodding toward the front door where Hadley and Josh had entered . " A yowling sound , like nothing I 'd ever heard on this earth , and the like of which I hope never to hear again . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most pathetic , most peculiarlooking creature I 'd ever seen . At first I thought I must have still been sleeping . But gradually it dawned on me . What I saw was real . I was looking at Clarence . But he was n't himself , not hardly . He was half man " Angus leaned forward and spit the last words at josh and Hadley " and half cat ! Black cat ! "  | Josh jumped and Hadley did too , even though she had known what was coming . " Wow , " said Josh , when he 'd recovered . " Half cat ! What did he look like ? " " Unnatural , " said Angus . " A walking , screeching nightmare , right there on my porch . He was about your sizesquirty for a boy , but big for a cat , if you see what I mean . I figure something went wrong with the spell , or whatever that creature up there uses to do her evil deeds . And there was Clarence , covered with black hairfur I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feet , and a tail . He had pointed furry ears and whiskersbut his face , his face looked just like Clarence . And that face looked at me with horror in its eyes . Horror ! Damnedest thing I ever saw , and not a sight I 'm likely to forget as long as I live . " " What happened to him ? " Josh asked , looking dazed . " I let him stay , once I got over the shock . He hung around a few days , eating cat food and drinking coffee out of a saucer , and staring at me with that look of horror on his face , like he 'd seen the very devil or worse . But he did n't last long . The whole thing was unnatural , like I said . He died , and I buried him right there in the backyard . " Angus leaned forward again , grinning dementedly at Josh . " Care to see the grave ? " Josh stood up , and so did Hadley . They began backing toward the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's things that go on up there that would make your blood run cold , boy , cold as ice . Cold  | as death . So if you 're smart , boy , and I hope you are , you 'll listen to Angus Tull like the rest of the kids around here . Stay away from Hogback Hill ! " By that time , Hadley and Josh had reached the door , opened it , and were walking quickly down the stairs . Hadley forgot about the missing step . Her leg fell through the hole and she tripped , sprawling on the matted grass in Angus 's front yard . " Hadley ! " Josh cried , turning to help her up . " Come on ! " " Stay away ! " Angus called . " Or you 'll be sorry . " Hadley and Josh ran , still hanging on to each other 's arms , until they were out of sight of Angus 's house and had turned the corner onto Hadley 's street . She and Josh stood looking at each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen your face when he asked you if you wanted to see the grave ! " Hadley said when she was able to talk . " My face ! What about your face when you fell through the step and Angus was right behind you ! " Josh giggled . " I thought you were a goner . " Hadley 's face grew sober . " You know , I never saw him act quite that way before . It was almost like he knows you want to go up there , Josh , and he was giving you a special warning . " She shuddered . " You 'd never get me up there , " she said . " Not after that . " Josh was quiet . Then he looked at his watch . " Oh , no ! I 've got to go ! " he said . " It 's a quarter of six , and I told Mom I 'd be home at five-thirty . She 'll be wondering where I am . Hadley , meet me at the corner by  | Larsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , okay ? " " Okay ! " agreed Hadley . " See you later . " " I 've got a plan ! " Josh called as he ran toward home . " Oh , great , " Hadley called back . " I ca n't wait to hear it . " And she turned to walk to her house , where no one would be home wondering where she was .  | Hadley let herself into the house and found a note from her mother : Hadley , sweetie , thanks for letting me sleep . I guess I needed it . But be sure to wake me up tomorrow morning . How does French toast sound ? Love , Mom Rummaging in the cupboard , Hadley came up with a can of chili-beef soup , and decided that would do for dinner . She warmed it up and ate it at the kitchen table , along with some crackers and a glass of milk . Her mother was always reminding her to be sure to have " something green " every night . She looked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked sort of a sickly gray , or else was white with mold . " Yuck . " She closed the vegetable bin and finished off her meal with some cookies and an apple . After doing her homework , she got ready for bed and stood at her window . The night was cloudy , and 32 33  | she could barely see Hogback Hill . Good , she thought , getting into bed and opening her book . If I do n't see it , maybe I wo n't think about it . She must have been more tired than she thought , because she fell asleep with the light on , only to awaken with a start , her heart racing . She had dreamed again about the hag of Hogback Hill . It was the same dream as always : the twisted , deformed figure of the woman reaching out for Hadley , beckoning with bony fingers and calling , " Come . Come to me . " But this time , Angus was in the dream , too , with the body of a cat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , " he hissed . " Stay away from Hogback Hill ! " Hadley lay trembling for what seemed like hours , until her mother came home . Only when she heard the familiar sounds of her mother downstairs , hanging up her coat and opening the refrigerator for a snack , could she relax . She was almost asleep when her mother stepped into her room and softly kissed her good-night . The next morning , Mrs. Patterson stood at the stove in her old blue bathrobe , her hair still tousled from sleeping , cooking French toast . She looked tired , as she always did lately , but still pretty . " Morn , " asked Hadley , " when you were my age , were you a foot taller than all the boys ? " " I do n't think so , " answered Mrs. Patterson . " I 'm only five feet , two inches now . " " Did you have crooked teeth ? " " I never had to have braces , if that 's what you mean , " said her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wondered if there was hope for me , " said Hadley , " to end up looking like you . " " Why , Hadley , " said her mother , surprised , " I must look a mess . But , honey , you look wonderful . You do n't resemble me too much , with that dark hair and those green eyes . You lookwell , like yourself . " " I guess I got more of Dad 's looks , " said Hadley . " At least he left you something , " said her mother . There was always a note of bitterness in her voice when she spoke of Hadley 's father . Hadley was sorry she had mentioned her father . She knew her mother did n't like to be reminded of him . Even though he had left them eight years ago , the mention of him still brought an angry frown to her mother 's face . Mrs. Patterson claimed not to want to talk about him , not to miss him . But Hadley knew that when her mother stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was thinking about him . Hadley did n't know if her mother missed her father or was just angry , still , at the way he had up and left them , suddenly , without a word . To Hadley , his leaving seemed to have happened a long time ago . She could n't really remember what it had been like to have him around . She tried to conjure up memories of himwhat he did , how he spoke , even what he looked likebut the memories were blurry and insubstantial . What she missed was the way things used to be before her mother had so many worries and so much work . " I met a new friend , " Hadley said , to change the subject . " His name 's Josh Carter . You know , his dad 's the dentist who said I have buck teeth . "  | " He did n't say that , " said Mrs. Patterson , flipping the French toast . " Well , that 's what he meant , " said Hadley . " Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they invited me to stay and eat . It was fun . Mrs. Carter asked if we could both come for dinner this Saturday night , but I said you had to work . You do n't think you could get the night off , do you ? " she asked wistfully . " What ? " asked Mrs. Patterson absentmindedly as she searched for the syrup . " Get the night off ? No , Hadley , you know better than that . " " Just asking , " said Hadley , but she had known what her mother would say . Even if she were n't working , she 'd have found some excuse not to go to the Carters ' house for dinner . Hadley knew she was n't the most popular kid in town , but at least she had had one good friend , Alison , and now it looked as if she and Josh were beginning to be friends . But Mrs. Patterson did n't know anyone , and she made no effort to meet anybody . Neighbors had stopped over when Hadley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her father had left . They had tried to be friendly , but in the face of Mrs. Patterson 's continual rebuffs , they 'd stopped calling . On television , single moms were always dating , bringing home new boyfriends who drove their kids crazy . But Hadley 's mother had n't had one date , had n't brought anybody home . She 'd spent time at home with Hadley and she 'd worked . And now , it seemed , she just worked .  | " In fact , " her mother continued as she put two pieces of French toast on a plate and handed it to Hadley , " I have to work extra this week . Tonight the Sheldrake is having a big Halloween party . A masked ball . We 're expecting over two hundred people , and the place will be a madhouse . And Shirley , who covers for me on my day off , is sick , and who knows when she 'll be back , so I wo n't be around much for a few days . Which reminds me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work today , and call the plumber about fixing this kitchen sink . If he can come today , and promises not to charge an arm and a leg , can you come right home after school to let him in ? " Hadley nodded , finishing her breakfast . She went upstairs to brush her teeth as her mother picked up the phone to dial the plumber . When she came back downstairs with her schoolbooks , her mother was on the phone . " All right . Three-thirty will be fine . My daughter , Hadley , will be here to let you in . . . . " She raised her eyebrows questioningly to Hadley . Hadley nodded and kissed her mother on the cheek , mouthing the words , " I 've got to go . " " Now , if it 's going to cost any more than that , you be sure to call me at work and check with me . . . . Yes . . . . Yes , the Sheldrake , that 's right . . . " her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gently behind her .  | Josh was waiting at the corner when Hadley got there . " Hi , " she called . " What 's this big plan of yours ? " Josh got right to the point . " We 're going trick-ortreating together tonight , " he said . " Great , " said Hadley . " On Hogback Hill , " Josh said , looking expectantly at Hadley . " What ! " Hadley could n't believe what she was hearing . " Yes ! Trick-or-treating on Hogback Hill ! It 's per-fect ! " Josh continued . " That 's what you said about going to see Angus , " said Hadley . " And it was perfect , Hadley . He was just like you said , only weirder . And the way I figure it , either Angus is totally crazy , or something strange really is going on up there . I want to find out which . " " I do n't , " said Hadley . " Hadley , come on . It 'll be a great " Adventure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please ? " " Oh , no , you do n't , Josh , " said Hadley . " You talked me into going to see Angus , but you 're not going to talk me into this . " " But , Hadley , what about the light ? " coaxed Josh . Are n't you curious ? " " Yes , " Hadley admitted . " I 've been curious about that light for a long time . " " Well , there 's only one way to find out what it is , and that 's to go up there , " declared Josh . " I 'm more scared than curious , Josh , and if you had any brains , you would be , too , " Hadley retorted . Josh 's face took on a stubborn look . " Okay , then , I 'll just have to go by myself , " he said . " You ca n't do that ! " said Hadley . " I 'll have to , " replied Josh , " if you wo n't come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat , is found , you 'll be very sorry . " " Josh , that 's not funny ! " Josh merely shrugged . Hadley tried another tactic . " You have to take Simon trick-or-treating , " she said . " He said something about us all going together tonight . " " I already took care of that , " said Josh . " I told my mom you and I would rather go by ourselves , and she said she 'd take Simon out while Dad answers the door at home . She 's so glad I have somebody to go with , I was pretty sure she 'd say yes . " " Oh , " said Hadley . They walked along in silence . Hadley thought about  | what Josh had said . He was rightshe was curious . For years the hunchbacked woman had haunted her dreams . How many nights had she looked up at Hogback Hill , wondering about its secrets ? How many nights had she awakened , like the night before , with the clammy sweat of her nightmares sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nightmares would stop . Maybe if she went up Hogback Hill with Josh , she would n't have to be afraid anymore . All right , " she said quietly . " I 'll go . "  | The plan was for Hadley to dress in her costume and go over to Josh 's house . They would leave from there to go trick-or-treating . They just would n't mention where . Hadley waited for the plumber , who did n't show up until four-thirty , and watched while he fixed the sink . Then she tried on her wizard costume from the year before and was dismayed to find that it was much too short , and that it barely fit over her shoulders . Darn ! She 'd forgotten how much she had grown in just one year . Looking through her mother 's closet , she found a long skirt with an elastic waist . She put it on and rolled the waistband over a few times . Then she tied a shawl around her shoulders and a kerchief around her head . For a final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's jewelry box and put them on . Looking at herself in the mirror , Hadley thought , How originala gypsy . But what difference did it make ? No one was going to see her except for Josh 's family . And the hag of Hogback Hill , she thought ner-vously . Just for fun , she took an eyebrow pencil from her  | mother 's makeup case and colored one of her front teeth black . Hadley grinned at herself in the mirror . Great ! Then , thinking that Josh 's father would appreciate the effect , she darkened several more teeth . She fixed herself a quick peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich , grabbed a flashlight , and headed for the Carters ' house . Simon met her at the door , dancing with excitement in his little skeleton suit , the bones glowing slightly green as he stepped from the lighted doorway out into the darkness of the porch . Hadley was ready for him . " Why do n't skeletons go to scary movies ? " she asked . " Do n't know ! " said Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They have n't got the guts ! " said Hadley . Simon ran into the house , calling , " Mom ! Dad ! Why do n't skeletons have the guts ? " Hadley laughed . She had looked up several more riddles , but it seemed Simon had enough to get mixed up for one night . " Josh ? " she called up the stairs . But instead of Josh , a tall skinny woman with long blond hair , thick black eyelashes , very red lips , a pink-and-white polka-dot dress , and pink high heels came lurching unsteadily down the hallway toward Hadley . In a peculiar voice that sounded a little bit like Josh 's imitation of his teacher , the woman said , " Hadley , darling , you look simply divine . I 'll have to borrow your earrings sometime . They would look smashing with my new hairdo . Care for a toothbrush , my dear ? "  | " Dr. Carter ! " Hadley giggled . Then , grinning up at him to show her " missing " teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more teeth to brush . " Dr. Carter 's large hands fluttered to his face in mock despair as Josh came down the stairs , looking terrific in his tight-fitting black costume with bones sewn all over , front and back , in all the right places . Josh looked at his father . " Dad , are you really going to wear that ? " " Why , Josh , darling , it 's my very newest frock , flown all the way from Paris for this evening . You do n't like it ? " answered Dr. Carter , pouting his lipsticked mouth . Josh rolled his eyes . " Let 's get out of this crazy house , " Josh said to Hadley as Simon came running into the room . " Josh ! Why do n't skeletons have enough guts ? " " Bye , Dad , " said Josh quickly , grabbing Hadley 's arm and pulling her out the door . " Bye , Mom ! " he called down the hallway . " Thanks for taking Simon . " " Remember , Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipping back into his normal voice . " Okay , Dad . See you . " " Whew ! " said Josh when they were walking down the dark street . " We got out safely . I was afraid something would go wrong at the last minute and we 'd get stuck with Simon . " " That was the easy part , " Hadley said . " Now we have to climb up Hogback Hill . "  | There was no path to the top of Hogback Hill , and the underbrush was thick and tangled on the lower slopes . Branches pulled at their hair and snapped in their faces . Wild grapevines reached out to trip them , and pricker bushes snagged at their clothing . Hadley 's skirt kept tripping her , and the stretchy material of Josh 's skeleton costume was getting caught on everything . " My mom 's going to kill me when she sees what I 'm doing to this costume , " Josh complained . " Stupid bushes ! " As he flailed noisily about , trying to free himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an eerie green light , dancing bizarrely in the blackness . Josh 's flashlight beam jumped crazily through the sky . " Josh ! Turn off your flashlight if you 're going to shine it all around like that , " she called softly . Anybody up there would see us coming for sure . " Hadley stood still , peering intently into the sudden darkness , waiting for her eyes to adjust . Looking back over her shoulder she saw the moon rising , huge and orange , over the town of Possum Hollow . She could see  | the swaying flashlight beams of the trick-or-treaters in the streets far below , and occasionally a laugh or a shriek carried up the hillside to where they stood . But there were no sounds on Hogback Hill , except for the wind moaning through the trees . As she waited for Josh to get untangled and catch up to her , Hadley tucked her skirt up out of the way . Her eyes had begun to adjust to the darkness . Soon she could see a few feet ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark places beyond her circle of vision . Then the howling began . Aaaarrr000000 . The sound seemed to start at the base of her spine . It traveled right up to the back of her neck , making all the little hairs stand on end . It seemed to stop her heart on the way , by making it impossible to breathe . " Josh ? " " Hadley ? " It started again , closer this time . Aaaarrr000000 . Josh came crashing through the bushes and grabbed Hadley 's arm . " What the heck is that ? " he asked shakily . " Coyotes , " she managed to answer when she could find her voice . She had heard them hundreds of times before from her bedroom , but it was different , being right there in the darkness with them . " Do n't worry , they eat much smaller stuff than peo-ple , " she told Josh . " Usually . "  | They stood for a moment , looking at the dim outlines of each other 's faces . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit now . " As the bushes and trees began to thin out , they could see to the very top of the hill . There , flickering faintly , was the light . " Look ! " Hadley said excitedly , pointing to the light . Josh nodded , staring upward . Soon the slope became steeper and more rocky , and the bushes gave way to an occasional stunted tree . The branches looked like groping , bony arms , and Hadley stayed away from them . She kept her eyes on the light . Sometimes it seemed to be beckoning them forward . The next moment , it seemed to warn them away . Stepping carefully , sometimes using their hands to help them keep their footing on the steep gravel hillside , they climbed on until the roofline of a small cabin became visible . Josh nudged Hadley excitedly , and she nodded to let him know that she , too , saw it . Neither of them spoke as they inched closer to the building . A light shone from the window . Another light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange glow . Hadley caught her breath in surprise . It was a jack-o ' - lantern . The pumpkin grinned lopsidedly , its wide , unblinking eyes seeming to look right at them . The candle inside it suddenly fluttered in the wind , and the light caught on a pair of yellow eyes by the door , then another pair , then another and another , until they saw dozens of staring yellow eyes .  | " Black cats , " Hadley whispered breathlessly . Something else caught her attention . On the ground next to the pumpkin was a bowl . Josh remained hidden in the shadows while Hadley took several steps closer . Inside the bowl were Halloween treats : Three Musketeers bars . She could n't believe her eyes . Forgetting every warning she 'd ever heard about taking candy from strangers , she reached into the bowl . All at once the door flew open and a figure stood silhouetted against the doorway . The figure had no head . Hadley screamed . Josh shouted , " Hadley , look out ! " Cats leaped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , frozen , staring at the figure , who also stood motionless . Cats brushed past Hadley 's legs , but still she stood , unable to move . Finally , she turned around and began to run after Josh , tripping , falling , crashing , rolling down the hill , heedless of the grasping branches and scratching thorns , her breath tearing from her throat in ragged sobs until at last she and Josh stood , breathless and exhausted , on the sidewalk that led from the foot of Hogback Hill to safety . Josh had forgotten to bring his atomizer , and Hadley had a new fear as she watched him sitting on the sidewalk , wheezing and gasping for air . " Josh , " she said desperately , " are you all right ? Should I get somebody ? " Josh shook his head as he continued his struggle to  | breathe . He held up a finger , signaling Hadley to wait a minute . After what seemed like a very long time , his breathing became easier and more regular . Hadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . No one was following them . Hogback Hill loomed , silent and seemingly empty , at their backs . Josh stood up . " Let 's get out of here , " he said . " Come onwe 'll go to my house , " suggested Hadley . " Wait . What 's your mother going to say when she sees us ? We 're a mess , " said Josh . " She 'll know we were n't trick-or-treating . " " It 's okay ; she 's not home . Come on ! " urged Hadley , eager to be gone . They hurried down the block and around the corner to Hadley 's house and let themselves in . When Hadley snapped on the light , they looked at each other and gasped . Josh 's skeleton costume was torn in several places , giving the effect of broken and shattered bones , and the fabric was pulled and snagged . His face was scratched and bleeding slightly , as were his hands . Hadley glanced in the hall mirror and saw that she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill me . " Josh moaned when he saw himself . " We can try to fix it , " said Hadley . She did n't sound very hopeful . But Josh was already thinking of other things . " Hadley , " he said , his voice low and his eyes wide , " did you see what I saw ? "  | " What did you see ? " asked Hadley carefully . " It 's what I did n't see , " said Josh . His face looked pale and his voice was shaky . " That person did n't have a head . " " That 's what I thought at first , too , " said Hadley slowly . " But she did , Josh . " " She ? " repeated Josh , bewildered . " When she first came to the door , all I could see was her outline against the lighted doorway , and it looked like she did n't have a head . But then , by the light of the jack-o ' - lantern , I could see that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over it hangs down low , like this . " Hadley hunched her back , held her shoulders forward and stuck her head out in front so that it seemed to grow out of her chest . And with her long hair hanging down over her shoulders and around her face , it looked like just a body standing there . I was so scared I turned and started to run , but before I turned I saw her face . " " Wait , " said Josh incredulously . " Are you trying to tell me there 's a woman up there and she really is a hunchback , after all ? " " Yes , " answered Hadley . Her voice sounded quiet and strange to her . And you saw her face ? What was it like ? " asked Josh . " it 's hard to describe , " said Hadley . " She looked scared . " " She looked scared ! " burst out Josh . Hadley paused , searching for the right word to use . " Yes . Scaredand shy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in disbelief " What was in the bowl ? " " You wo n't believe this , " said Hadley . " Treats , Halloween treats . Like she was expecting us . " " What kind of treats ? Salamander eyes or some-thing ? " " No , " answered Hadley softly , opening her hand . " Three Musketeers . They both stared at the squashed candy bar lying in Hadley 's outstretched palm , I he wrapper torn almost all the way off . " I took it from ( he bowl before I ran . It was still in my hand when we gut to the bottom of the hill . " Josh was looking amazed , and Hadley could n't blame him . She could scarcely believe it herself . " Did she do anything ? Like try to cast a spell on you ? " asked Josh . Hadley shook her head . " She juststood there . " " Have you ever seen her before ? " asked Josh . " No . " " That makes it even stranger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , this town 's so small , everybody knows ever body , right ? " Hadley nodded . " So if you 've never seen her before , she must never come down to town . " Hadley nodded again . " So where did she get the Three Musketeers bars ? " " I thought of that , too , Josh , " she said . " She must come down from there . "  | Thev stared at each other in silence . At the same time , they asked , " But when ? " After Josh left , Hadley stared for a long time at Hogback Hill . The light no longer shone . The hill was shrouded in darkness . A few stray clouds passed between its peak and the full Halloween moon . It looked deserted , desolate . One of Hadley 's questions had been answered . The of Hogback Hill was real ! But who was she ? And t was she doing up there ? Hadley felt no closer to answers than before , and more curious than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley at the corner , looking dejected . " What 's the matter ? " she asked . " I 'm in a lot of trouble because of last night , " he mumbled . " My parents wanted to know what I 'd been doing to get all scratched up like that . My mom wanted to know how I 'd wrecked my costume . They wanted to know why I did n't have any candy . " " What did you tell them ? " asked Hadley . " The truth , " said Josh . " That we went up Hogback Hill . " " Did you tell them why ? " " I just told them we wondered what it was like up there , which is true . I said we wanted to explore it because it 's such a spooky place . They know how I like mysteries and stuff , so they were n't surprised , but they were mad . They said it was dangerous , and I should have told them where I was going . Mom got all upset about me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to spend this weekend at home under supervision . ' In jail , in other words , " he finished miserably . " What did your mom say ? "  | " She did n't see me last night . She had to work late cause the Sheldrake had a big Halloween ball . So she slept in this morning , " Hadley answered . " You 're lucky , " said Josh . " My parents are always around , wanting to know every little thing I do . You can do whatever you want . " Hadley laughed . For the first time , she could see some advantages to her situation . Anyway , Hadley , " Josh continued , " I 've been thinking . " " Me , too , " said Hadley . " I could n't get to sleep last night . " " Me neither . And you know what ? I do n't think whoever is up there comes to town at all . I think someone must take her stuff , like the candy bars . Because even if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , people would have seen her . She 'd have to go to stores to buy things . And then everybody would know about her ; people would talk about her . People besides Angus , I mean . I 've lived here long enough to know that . My mom says you ca n't sneeze around here without half a dozen people saying gesundheit ! " Josh was right . In Possum Hollow , everybody pretty much knew everybody else 's business . People who kept to themselves , like Hadley 's mother , were left alone . But that did n't mean people did n't talk about them . If the woman on the hill came to town , people would talk , sure as the sun came up every morning . " So , " Hadley said slowly , " the question is , who ? Who visits her ? " " Maybe it 's someone from out of town , " suggested Josh.  | " I do n't know , " said Hadley , thinking . " If a stranger kept coming to town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's got to be someone from Possum Hollow . Someone who can come and go and walk down the street and shop in the store without anyone paying attention . Someone we see all the time . Someone normal . " " Normal ? " Josh repeated . " You know what I mean , " Hadley said . " It 's got to be someone we would n't suspect . " " Okay . So how do we find out ? " Josh asked . " I knew you 'd say that , " Hadley answered , grinning at Josh . It was funny . A few days ago , before she knew Josh , she 'd have wanted nothing to do with such schemes . She had wondered what was happening on Hogback Hill , but she 'd never thought she could find out . When Josh wanted to know something , there was no stopping him . And now here she was , thinking just like him . " I already figured that out , " she said with satisfaction . " We 'll ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Josh looked incredulous . " Do you really think someone in a store is going to remember who bought a certain kind of candy ? " " It 's not as dumb as it sounds , Josh , " answered Hadley . " This is Possum Hollow , remember ? Mr. and Mrs. Larsen know everything . It 's worth a tryunless you have a better idea , that is . " " Okay , " agreed Josh . " We 'll go right after school . "  | As soon as school let out , Hadley and Josh walked down Sycamore Street to Larsen 's Market . Old Mr. Larsen was sitting , as usual , behind the cash register , while Mrs. Larsen bustled about at the butcher 's counter , cutting and weighing chicken legs for Mrs. Josie Sloan . " Good afternoon , children , " she sang out . " Hi , Mrs. Larsen , " they called back . Then , turning to Mr. Larsen , who was more than a little deaf , they shouted , " HELLO , MR . LARSEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the new feller 's name ? Oh , yes , John . " " It 's Josh , " corrected Josh . " Yes , hello , John . How are you ? Your mother was in earlier . You 'll be having pork chops tonight , if I 'm not mistaken , with potatoes , gravy , and green beans . " Hadley could n't resist looking smugly at Josh . " What did I tell you ? " she whispered . " What can I do for you children today ? " asked Mr. Larsen . Hadley smiled and said , " Well , Mr. Larsen , this is probably going to sound kind of odd , but we were  | wondering who has been buying Three Musketeers bars lately . " " What , child ? Speak up now " Hadley looked around , embarrassed . Josh looked the other way , suddenly appearing to be fascinated by a display of headache remedies several aisles away . Seeing that he was going to be of no help , Hadley plunged on , more loudly this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Heavens , child , it was just Halloween . Sold lots of candy . Bags and bags of it . " " BUT HOW ABOUT THREE MUSKETEERS ? " asked Hadley , feeling extremely foolish . Mr. Larsen appeared to be thinking it over . There was a long pause , during which Hadley looked at Josh . He was looking down the aisle in front of him . With an expression of panic , he turned toward Hadley and put his finger frantically to his lips . She looked at him , perplexed . He drew his finger across his neck , pointed to Mr. Larsen , put his finger to his lips again as if he were try - ing to shush someone , and pointed to Mr. Larsen again . What on earth is wrong with him ? Hadley won-dered . Meanwhile , Mr. Larsen was talking again . " Well , now , it seems to me maybe Evelyn Dorsey bought some , though I could n't be absolutely certain . It could have been Milky Ways ; they 're on the same shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dorsey was his  | teacher ! But Josh was n't paying any attention . He was still staring down the aisle , looking as if he were going to burst . " And I believe Bud and Helen Fancett picked up some for trick or treat . I recall they had something of a discussion about it . . . . " Mr. Larsen paused again , lost in concentration . I Iadley looked at Josh . His eyes were practically bugging out of his head . What was going on ? Mr. Larsen resumed his recollections . " Of course , Angus buys ' em regular . " Angus ! Hadley looked over at Josh again to see if he 'd heard . Josh was looking positively ill . She was about to say something to him when she saw the reason for his strange behavior . Her stomach gave a sickening lurch as Angus Tull stepped into view fmm behind the shelves of canned vegetables . " Yep , Angus buys Three Musketeers regular , " Mr. Larsen continued , oblivious . " Them and the Junior Mints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Well , well , speak of the devil , and does n't he just show up . Hello , Angus . " Angus did n't reply . He stood , glowering at Josh and I Iadley with a murderous look . " These two youngsters were just asking " " Nosy , interfering little brats , " interrupted Angus . " I ought to teach you a lesson " Angus looked truly frightening . His face was very red , his blue eyes were blazing , his bristly white eyebrows were quivering , and his voice sounded peculiar , is if he were having trouble getting the words out .  | " Take it easy , Angus , " said Mr. Larsen . " Getting all riled up ca n't be good for that heart of yours . The children were only asking " " I do n't care what they were asking . " Angus looked at Josh long and hard , then turned his fierce blue eyes on Hadley and kept them there . " Mind your own busi-ness ! " He left his shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked to the door . He stopped by Josh , pointed his finger at Josh 's chest , and said furiously , " And stay away from that hill ! " Then he stormed out of the store . Mr. Larsen looked from Hadley to Josh , his face puzzled . " Now what was that all about ? " Hadley kept quiet , trying to stop her trembling , letting Josh do the talking for a while . " Uh , II do n't know , " Josh stammered . " He was acting pretty crazy . " " What 's all this about Three Musketeers ? " Mr. Larsen probed . " We 're doing kind of an investigation , " explained Josh . " You sure make a good eyewitness , " added Hadley . " Might have lost my hearing , but I have n't lost my mind , " replied Mr. Larsen slyly . " That 's for sure , sir , " Josh said as he and Hadley headed for the door . " Thanks , " they both called , slipping away before Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street they looked anxiously in both directions , but there was no sign of Angus.  | " Do you think he knows we went up there ? " asked Josh . " I do n't know , " answered Hadley . " Do you think he heard me asking about the Three Musketeers bars ? " " Everybody in the whole store must have heard 0U , " said Josh . " Well , you were n't being much help ! " answered I ladley . " Maybe he was still mad from the other day , " she went on . " Or maybe he was mad because we were Milking about him just when he came near . " " I ca n't believe he 's been buying Three Musketeers Ixars ! " Josh said excitedly . But then he shook his head , looking perplexed . " But Angus is the last person who 'd he going up Hogback Hill with candy bars ! He 's afraid he 'll get turned into a black cat like his friend Clarence . " " Yeah , " said Hadley slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Josh continued , " what about our other sus-pects ? " " Your teacher and the Fancetts , " said Hadley . " Do you think Mrs. Dorsey is taking candy bars up Hogback Hill ? " Josh burst out laughing . Mrs. Dorsey was quite stout . " Can you imagine her getting up that steep part near the top ? " he asked . " I do n't think so . Anyway , she has an alibi , in a way . She gave out Three Musketeers bars at our class Halloween party . And besides , she 's Always at school . " " Yeah , " said Hadley . And the Fancetts are so old . Mr. Fancett walks with a cane , and Mrs. Fancett hardly ever comes out of the house . "  | Angus is no spring chicken , either , " Josh said . " So you do n't think any of our suspects are the one ? " asked Hadley . " We could stake out their houses , " suggested Josh , but he did n't sound too thrilled about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , Josh , " she said , " we do n't have to stake out their houses . We can stake out the foot of Hogback Hill . " " Yeah ! " said Josh enthusiastically . " Sooner or later , we 'll catch ' em red-handed . " " So do you want to go tomorrow after school ? " asked Hadley . " Yes ! " said Josh . Then he frowned . " Tomorrow 'll be my only chance . I have to stay home all weekend . Jeez ! I wish my mother worked all the time like yours . " Hadley did n't answer . They 'd been walking as they talked and had reached the Carters ' driveway . " Okay , see you tomorrow then , " said Hadley . " Meet you at the corner in the morning ? " asked Josh . " Sure , " Hadley answered , smiling . She walked the nine-and-a-half blocks to her house . When she came to the street where Angus lived , she glanced nervously about , but there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home and locked the door behind her .  | The next morning , Hadley and her mother sat at the kitchen table . Hadley was eating a bowl of cereal , and Mrs. Patterson was drinking coffee , trying to wake up . " Shirley 's feeling better and said she would come in for me on Sunday , " Mrs. Patterson was saying . " So if I can just make it through today and Saturday , I 'll finally have a day off on a weekend . What would you like to do ? " Hadley thought for a moment . " We could rake the leaves in the yard ! " " Sounds good , " said Mrs. Patterson , smiling tiredly . " We have a million chores to get done , and raking the yard is one of them . I wish we could afford to hire somebody to do it . " " Maybe Josh could come over to help , " said Hadley . Then she remembered that Josh was supposed to stay home that weekend . Before she could say anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of other things to do as well , and I 'm looking forward to a little time to just relax . "  | " Okay , Morn , " said Hadley . There was no point in arguing , since Josh could n't come anyway . " That reminds me , " said Mrs. Patterson . " I have to make another appointment for you with your friend Josh 's father . " " You should come with me sometime and meet him , Mom . He 's really nice . You should have seen him on Halloween night . He was " Mrs. Patterson interrupted her . " You 're seeing a lot of this Josh fellow , are n't you ? " " Yes , " answered Hadley happily . " Be careful now , Hadley , " said her mother . " Go easy . " What do you mean ? " asked Hadley , feeling con-fused . " I just mean that if you get too attached to this Josh , you might be sorry . Remember how sad you felt when Alison moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Hadley . " He just moved here . " " Yes , I know that . Honey , look , all I 'm saying is that if you let people get too close , it can be hard on you if they leave . " Hadley did n't know what to say . " Do n't you want me to be friends with Josh ? " she asked . Mrs. Patterson sighed . " Yes . I want you to be friends . I just do n't want to see you hurt . " She seemed about to say more , then shook her head as if she were shaking thoughts away . " Do n't pay any attention to me . I 'm just gloomy today , I guess . " She shrugged , giving a weak laugh .  | " Morn , I 'd better get going . I 'm supposed to meet Josh at the corner , " Hadley said . She gave her mother a kiss . " Okay , sweetie . Have a good day . " " You , too , Morn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She looked back to see her mother staring into her coffee cup , her mouth tightly set . Hadley did n't have to guess what she was thinking about .  | That afternoon , Hadley and Josh sneaked around Angus Tull 's house and took up a position on the lower slope of Hogback Hill . They made themselves comfortableand , they hoped , invisibleon the soft bed of fallen needles under one of the stunted pine trees . They sat very still and tried to be quiet , but it was frustrating not to be able to talk to each other . At first they thought they heard all sorts of sinister sounds . Every twig that snapped , every leaf that blew , made them turn , expecting to see a furtive figure making its way past them up the hill . But after a while , they began to relax . Josh whispered , " I always thought it would be exciting to be a policeman or a private eye . But stakeouts have got to be the most boring duty ever ! " Hadley was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though none of their suspects had appeared . Also , she noticed that the hillside was coining alive now that she and Josh had been still for sonic time . Squirrels scampered about , hiding nuts ; birds landed in the branches of the pine tree , tilting their heads at her as if wondering what peculiar kind of bird  | she was . Ants went trooping by on their own mysterious , miniature business , while spiders waited patiently by their webs . " Look ! " she said . Her heart was pounding with excitement , and she almost made the mistake of moving to point . Two deer had appeared on the hillside below them , munching on the tender lower branches of the bushes . Suddenly they lifted their heads , sniffed the air , and were gone , their white tails flashing like two white handkerchiefs . " Deer ! " cried Josh , laughing with relief . " You almost gave me a heart attack ! I thought you saw . . . " He paused , turning slowly toward Hadley . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hadley shrieked as they rolled down the hill a few feet . " Josh , we 're supposed to be quiet ! " she said when she was able to stop laughing . " Come on , Hadley , " said Josh , pushing himself up from the ground . " We might as well face facts . We 're not going to see anybody today , and I 'm freezing . Let 's go . " They brushed the pine needles from their clothes and started down the hill . They were very quiet as they approached the bottom and , skirting well around Angus 's house , stepped out onto the sidewalk . " Well , that was n't very thrilling , " Josh commented . " What are we going to do next ? " " Do you really have to stay around home all week-end ? " Hadley asked .  | " Yeah , " replied Josh dejectedly . " I 'll probably come back here tomorrow and give it another try , " said Hadley . " It 's Saturday , and if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " " Your mom has to work ? " asked Josh . Hadley nodded . " You get to do whatever you want all weekend ? " he asked . Hadley shrugged . " Yeah . Well , Mom has Sunday of f , and we 'll probably do chores . But I wo n't see much of her before then . " " Lucky , " said Josh . " Meanwhile , I 'll be home getting riddled to death by Simon . By Monday I 'll be a raving maniac . I 'll be dying to go back to school ! " When they reached Hadley 's house , Josh said he 'd try to call Hadley over the weekend to see how her stakeout went on Saturday , and they made plans t o meet at the corner on Monday morning . " You 're not afraid to do the stakeout alone ? " asked Josh . Hadley shook her head . She truly was n't . She did n't really believe she was going to see the hag 's mysterious visitor , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds and animals and insects . Besides , she did n't have anything else to do . " Okay . Call me if you crack the case , " said Josh with a grin . " Which I probably will , " replied Hadley , returning the smile . " See you . Oh , waithere 's a riddle for Simon . Maybe if you spend all weekend working on it with him , he 'll get it right . What does a witch order in motel ? " " What ? " asked Josh . " Broom service , " answered Hadley . Josh groaned . " It 's awful . He 'll love it . " " Bye . " Hadley waved as Josh walked down the street . *Sec you Monday . "  | Hadley woke up early Saturday morning , filled with eagerness to return to Hogback Hill . Her mother had left her a note on the kitchen counter . Hadley , honey , I 'm beat . I had to work until 1:30 , so I 'll probably sleep late . I have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until quite late . But we 'll have all of Sunday together . There 's sliced turkey for sandwiches or to heat up with gravy tonight . Love , Mom Hadley ate some cereal , then made a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and put it into a paper sack along with an apple , some crackers , and a carton of juice . Next she got the binoculars and an old army blanket , and put everything in her backpack . When she was ready , she wrote a note underneath her mother 's : Dear Mom , I ate breakfast and made lunch , too . She could n't think of what else to say . It seemed that she and her mother did most of their communicating  | by note these days . Since it was too complicated to try to explain where she was going , she just added : See you tomorrow . Do n't work too hard ! Love , Hadley She stepped out into the cool November morning and headed for Hogback Hill . It was only six-thirty , and the sky was just beginning to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adventurous and strangely excited , walking through the empty streets of Possum Hollow while everyone else was still sleeping . The town looked different at that hour of the morning , mysterious and otherworldly . She sneaked past Angus 's house , but there was no sign of life . She came to the spot where she and Josh had started climbing the hill the day before . She almost started tip at the same place , when she had an idea . Continuing past the point at which the sidewalk ended , she proceeded to the farthest outreaches of town , an area where nobody lived . On her left there was an ugly pile of broken-down cars , rusty washing machines , and junk of all kinds in what used to be the Possum Hollow dump . Hadley began looking carefully at the slope of the hill . The undergrowth was as thick and tangled on this part of the hill as it was elsewhere . It seemed to be an impenetrable barrier of thorny branches and made I Hadley think about the prince trying to chop his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she thought of Rapunzel , with her long , long  | hair , locked away high in a tower in the deep , dark forest . Maybe the hag is under a spell , too , Hadley thought , and I 'm the only one who can break it . She shook her head , laughing at herself . Then she saw it . There was a small opening in the thick wall of brush . Looking around and seeing no one , she slipped through the opening and discovered , as she had hoped , that there was a path that led up the hill . It was n't muchjust a narrow place where the undergrowth had been tramped down and the branches pushed back enough to allow a person to slip through without too much struggle . She had found the path that the hag 's mysterious visitor used ; she was sure of it ! The back of her neck prickled with excitement as she began following the trail upward . When she came to where the trees began to grow thin and sparse , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees away from the welltraveled route . She spread out the army blanket on a patch of ground from which she 'd be able to clearly see both the path and the outline of the cabin . She began to wait . Taking the binoculars from the pack , Hadley pointed them at the hag 's little house and peered intently at the windows , the door , the yard . There was no sign of movement . Then she remained very still , and , once again , the small creatures who inhabited the hillside grew accustomed to her presence and went about their business . As time passed with no sign of another human being , Hadley 's mind began to wander . She thought  | about Josh , at home with Simon for the entire weekend , and she smiled . She thought about her mother , home sleeping off the exhaustion of work so that she mild go back and work another twelve- or thirteenhour day . Mom might as well live up here on Hogback I ( ill , Hadley mused , for all the fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the truth was that her mother 's behavior puzzled Hadley . She did n't want her life to be like her mother 's and she wondered if there was anything she could do about it . Hadley wondered , too , about the strange remarks her mother had made at the breakfast table the morning before . Her mother had been gloomy . It was n't fair to think Josh was like Hadley 's father or anybody else . Josh was just Josh . And Hadley liked him , no matter what her mother said . By late afternoon Hadley 's food was all gone and she had wrapped herself up in the army blanket to keep away the creeping chill . The shadows of the pine trees were disappearing into the falling darkness , and I ladley decided that it was time to go home . She was gathering up her things and stuffing them into her backpack when she became aware of a steady shuffling on the hillside below her . Standing straight and absolutely still , she stared at the place where the path entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the sounds of crunching leaves and breaking twigs . It sounded so loud that she thought she would see not a person , but some huge creature emerging from the trees .  | But when a figure stepped into view , it was a pert all right . Even in the gathering gloom of twilight , t h was no mistaking who it was . Stopping for a mom to catch his breath was Angus Tull.  | Hadley stared , terrified , praying that her hiding place was good enough . Angus Tull ! She wished Josh was with her . She wished she and Josh had talked about what they would do if they actually saw the hag 's visitor . Josh had said Angus was the last person who would be climbing I logback Hill , but here he was . Watching him struggling to catch his breath , Hadley realized that Angus was a very old man . What brought him , with a pack on his back , clutching his chest and gasping for air , to the lop of Hogback Hill ? She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew what Josh would do . He would follow Angus the rest of the way up the hill and see if he could find ( nit what was going on . Hadley did n't like to think what Angus would do if he caught her on Hogback 1 l ill . Angus collected himself and walked the rest of the way to the cabin , knocked , and went inside . Several black cats followed him through the door . Hadley waited a moment , took a deep breath , and began creeping silently toward the house .  | The windows were closed against the November cold , but the door had bounced open a crack after Angus went inside . Hadley stole right up to the door , flattened herself against the wooden boards , and strained to hear the voices coming from inside . ... all I know . I 'm getting too old to get up this blasted hill , carrying all this stuff . " It was Angus 's voice . " I do n't need so much , Angus , " answered another voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to come so often . " " That 's not the point , Netta , and you know it , " replied Angus , his voice quarrelsome and impatient . " What if something happened to me ? Where would that leave you ? " There was a long silence . Netta ! So that was her name ! A cat and two kittens began rubbing against Hadley 's legs , and she hoped they would n't start screeching , as they had before . Then Netta said quietly , " Someone knows about me . " Hadley jumped . Angus shouted , " What ? " " Someone knows I 'm here , " repeated Netta . " What are you talking about ? " said Angus furiously . A girl . And someone else . They came on Halloween night . " Hadley 's heart was hammering against her chest . " Did they bother you ? " Angus 's voice rose angrily . " Those nosy , interfering brats ! Did they "  | " No , no , " Netta said hastily . " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran away . " " Damn kids , " muttered Angus . " I know who they are . I warned them to keep away from here when they came snooping around asking questions . " " This girl . . . she seemed different . She had a kind face . I wished " Angus interrupted . " Children are n't kind , Netta . They 're cruel . You remember what happened before . " Again there was a silence . Then Netta said softly , " I remember . " " Now , Netta , those brats coming here only proves my point . It 's no good anymore . We ca n't have you staying here . Those kids probably told half the town about you by now . They 'll all be trooping up here to torment you . Why , I 'll worry to death about you . Netta , it 's time . There 's an opening at the nursing home , and I want you to take it . " " No , Angus . You must try to understand . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The peace , the quiet , my cats , the wild creatures . I can do as I like . You might not think that 's much , but it 's what I 'm used to . I wo n't go where I 'll be closed up and told what I can do and when I can do it . I 'd die there . " " Netta , you 're being melodramatic and you know it . They 'll take care of you . You 'll get medical attention . Do n't you try to tell me you 're not in pain . " " My back 's no worse than it 's been for a long time , Angus . I can stand it . What I ca n't stand is the idea of  | leaving here . I do n't need to be taken care of . I wo n't do it , Angus . I wo n't speak of it anymore . " There was a sound that Hadley was quite sure was Angus 's fist pounding on a table . His voice was exasperated when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you see reason . We ca n't go on like this any longer . Do n't you understand ? I 'm only trying to do what 's best for you ! " There was another sound , like a snort . Netta answered quietly , " What 's best for me , Angus ? Or what 's best for you ? " There was no answer . " It was convenient for you to have me come here fifty-seven years ago , and now it 's convenient for you to have me go down . But I 've learned to like it here , Angus . If you really want to do what 's best for me , you 'll find a way for me to stay here . " No one spoke for a long time . Finally , Angus said in a tired voice , " All right , Netta , you win . But how can I rest easy when my sister 's up here all alone , depending on me , and me eighty-one years old ? Someday this old carcass of mine just plain wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? " " We 'll think of something , Angus . We always have , have n't we ? Now , you 'd better get along before it gets any darker . " " I 'm going to break my fool neck one of these nights , " Angus grumbled . Hadley heard the sound of a chair being pushed back . She wanted to keep listening , but it sounded as if Angus would be coming through  | the door at any moment , and the last thing she wanted was to be discovered eavesdropping by Angus Tull . She hid in the bushes and waited until Angus disappeared down the path . Her brain was whirling . The hagNettawas Angus 's sister ! Fifty-seven years she had spent on top of Hogback Hill ! Hadley could n't imagine it . Why , she thought , Netta must have been a young woman when she came here . Slowly making her way down the hill through the darkness , Hadley knew that she would return to Hogback Hill . She wants me to come , Hadley thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Hadley got home , she called Josh . " Josh ? Hi , it 's Hadley . " " Hi , " answered Josh . " How 'd the stakeout go ? " " You wo n't believe this ! " Hadley said . " I found a path , the one that the hag 's visitor uses all the time . So I followed it , and hid near the top of the hill and waited and , just as I was about to give up and go home , I heard somebody coming . You 'll never guess who it was ! " " Who ? " asked Josh . " Guess , " said Hadley . " Who was it ? Come on , " said Josh eagerly , " just tell me ! " All right , " said Hadley . " It was " she paused feu dramatic effectAngus Tull . " Angus ! What was he doing up there ? " cried Josh excitedly . " He was bringing Netta groceries . " " Netta ? " asked Josh hesitantly . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name . Netta Tull. "  | " Netta Tull ? " " She 's Angus 's sister , " said Hadley . And here 's the really unbelievable partshe 's been up there fiftyseven years ! " " Wow , " Josh said softly . " Fifty-seven years . " They were both quiet for a moment . " Why ? " " I do n't know , " answered Hadley . " He wants her to leave and go to some home , but she does n't want to . She told him we 'd been there . " " She did ? What did he say ? " " He was really mad . Called us interfering little brats . I le said we would tell everyone and the whole town would be going up there to torment her . He said children are cruel . Remember what happened before ? ' he asked . But , Josh , I do n't care what Angus says ; I want to go back . " " He 'll really be on the lookout for us now , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you find all this out , anyway ? " asked Josh . " I sneaked up after Angus and hid outside the door . I could hear them talking inside , " said Hadley . " What if he 'd caught you ? " said Josh . " I was a little worried about that , too , " said Hadley . " I wish I 'd been there ! " Josh cried . " I was wishing the same thing when Angus first showed up ! " Hadley joked . " So when do you want to go back ? " asked Josh . " I 'd really like to go tomorrow , " said Hadley , " but it 's my mom 's day off , and we usually do something together . Plus , you have to stay home , right ? "  | " Yeah , " said Josh gloomily . " Here you 're tracking down dangerous suspects and I 'm stuck watching cartoons with Simon . " Hadley laughed . Then she said seriously , " Josh ? Do n't tell anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , who am I going to tellSimon ? " " Just do n't tell anybody . Angus is so sure we will , I want to prove he 's wrong . Besides , it sounded like well , like something happened before , something to do with kids ; I do n't know . But until we find out , let 's keep this a secret . " She thought the idea of a secret would appeal to Josh , and it did . " My lips are sealed , " he vowed . Then he added , " What was she like ? Did she seem crazy ? " " No , " said Hadley slowly . " She did n't act crazy at all . Actually , Angus sounded crazier than she did , at least from what I heard . " " I wonder what they 're up to ? " " I do n't know , " said Hadley . " But I want to find out . " " Me , too ! " said Josh . " Do you want to go after school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Josh . " Okay . See you at the corner Monday morning ? " asked Hadley . " I 'll be there , " said Josh . That evening , Hadley baked brownies with nuts inside and icing on the top . She put some on a plate so that  | her mother would see them when she got home . The rest she wrapped carefully in aluminum foil . She wanted to have something special to take to Netta on Monday . As she stood at her window that night , looking up at the softly shining light , Hadley felt not fear , but a strange excitement . She felt a deep curiosity about the woman who lived on the hill and a conviction that , no matter what Angus said , Netta wanted her to come back . She thought of her dreams , of the woman crying , " Come to me , come to me . " " I 'm coming , Netta , " she said . " I 'm coming . "  | The next morning , Hadley was up and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set the table , and spread strips of bacon in the frying pan to cook . Her mother always got the coffeemaker ready the night before , and Hadley turned it on . It was n't long before Mrs. Patterson appeared at the door to the kitchen , smiling sleepily . " Dirty trick , Had , " she said . " I might have been able to sleep through the smell of coffee or bacon , but never both . " " I figured I had to give you the double whammy to get you out of bed , " said Hadley . " Mmm , " said her mother , pouring a cup of coffee and sitting at the table . " Now that you 've got me up , what do I have to do next ? " " First you can relax and eat breakfast , " said Hadley . " But " " I knowsince you cooked , I have to clean up . " " Right , " said Hadley with a grin . " It 's only fair . Them we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doing the laundry , and getting groceries . "  | Her mother groaned . " I 'm going back to bed . " " Waitthen we can rake the leaves . And then I was thinking we could go to the movies this afternoon , " Hadley finished . " I can see you 've given this some thought , " said Mrs. Patterson . " I just hope it 's a good movie , or I 'm liable to fall asleep . This past week has been awful . " It was on the tip of Hadley 's tongue to suggest once again that her mother try to find a job that was n't so exhausting , but at the last minute she said instead , " Mom , why would somebodya young womanhide away from the whole world and never see people or get married or go places or anything ? " Her mother put her coffee cup down carefully on the saucer and said , " What 's this all about , Hadley ? " " I just " " Has someone been talking to you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hadley said , surprised . " No . " " Because if I do n't want to get married again after what I went through the first time , it 's perfectly understandable . " Hadley stared down at the bacon sizzling in the pan , feeling bewildered . She remembered sitting on Hogback Hill thinking that her mother might as well live there , too . Now , when she was asking about Netta , her mother thought she was talking about her . She thought about what her mother had told her about her marriage to Hadley 's father . She had been " madly in love " with him , she 'd said . Hadley recalled  | the pictures in the old trunk in the attic . One , taken when her parents were both eighteen , was their wedding picture . Hadley 's mother , her long hair piled on top of her head in an elaborate mass of curls and flowers , was holding the arm of a tall , skinny boy wearing a tuxedo that looked several sizes too large . Her moth-er 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen , but the boy on her arm did n't look much older than Hadley herself . Hadley had asked where all the other people were , and her mother had said sadly that no one was there . They had gone to a justice of the peace because her parents and his parents were all dead set against the marriage . " They said we were too young , " Mrs. Patterson said with a sigh , " and of course they were right . But we did n't believe it then . " The rest of the story Hadley knew only too well . Her mother began working as a waitress , and her father kept getting jobs and losing them . Soon Hadley 's mother was pregnant . Hadley remembered a picture of her father holding her , looking proud but unsure of himself . Finally , he had gotten a job at a lumber mill , but when hard times hit , Hadley 's father , being one of the newest workers , was one of the first to be laid off . Hadley 's mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him gone without a word . Mrs. Patterson 's voice had a bitter , mocking edge when she spoke about him . " He could have taken another job , but he was too proud to take the jobs he could have had . Did he think waitressing was the most  | glamorous job in the world ? He just plain could n't face up to the responsibility of having a wife and a child , and when things got too tough , he ran away . " Her mouth twisted defiantly . " And we 've been just fine without him . " Hadley 's mind returned to the present . As she lifted strips of bacon out of the pan and put them on a paper towel to drain , she tried to remember what her mother had just said . Something about having good reasons for not getting married again . " I know , Mom , " she said . " No one has said anything to you about this ? " asked her mother . " Nobody , Mom , really , " Hadley answered quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was justI was thinking about something else . " " Good , " said Mrs. Patterson . " I know how people like to talk around here , and I . . . Well , it does n't matter . I did n't mean to jump on you , honey . " " It 's okay , Mom . " " When your father walked out on us , I promised myself I 'd never let anyone do that to me again . We do n't need anybody else . We 're fine , just the two of us , are n't we ? " There was a beseeching note in Mrs. Patterson 's voice , and Hadley knew her mother wanted it to be true . " Sure , " Hadley answered uncomfortably . But she did n't really agree with her mother . Yes , they were fine , just the two of them . But it would be nice to have a dad like Josh 's and a brother or sister . And it  | was fun having a friendlike Josh . Was n't her mother lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips of bacon alongside , and carried the plates to the table , Then she poured two glasses of orange juice and sat down to eat . " This looks wonderful , Had , " said her mother , buttering her pancakes . " Maybe later you can read your social studies report out loud to me . Remember how I used to cone home from waitressing and put my poor , tired old feet up on the coffee table while you read ? " she asked , smiling fondly at Hadley . " That was fun , but I sure do n't miss waitressing . No more swollen ankles for me . " Hadley smiled weakly at her mother . So that was that . She could n't ask her mother to go back to a job she hated . She helped her mother carry the dishes to the sink , then went upstairs to strip the sheets off the beds . Later that afternoon , as they sat together in the darkened theater waiting for the movie to start , Hadley thought about her mother and Netta Tull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In it , she climbed Hogback Hill and knocked on the door of Netta 's cabin . A woman came to the door , but when Hadley looked up to see her face , it was n't Netta , after all , but Hadley 's mother .  | After school on Monday , Hadley and Josh walked toward Hogback Hill , made sure the coast was clear , headed to the secret path , and started climbing . " How did you ever find this path ? " asked Josh . " Simple deductive reasoning , " said Hadley modestly . Actually , I was trying to think like you do . Like a detective . I figured there had to be a path some-where . " " It 's a lot easier walking here , that 's for sure , " Josh commented . And we wo n't get ripped to shreds like we did on Halloween . " " I was thinking , " said Hadley , " that it seems kind of rude to suddenly appear at Netta 's door out of the blue . She is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the clearing where she can see us , and let her decide what to do . " " Okay . " Josh shrugged . " Sounds good to me . " They walked slowly into the open , where they would be clearly visible from the house . Several cats blinked sleepily at them from the steps . Hadley pointed . " Look . They 're not all black . "  | " So much for Angus 's stories , " Josh said . The cats showed no interest in moving from t Ii places on the sunny steps . Hadley and Josh sto uncertainly in the clearing , wondering what to do Netta did not appear . But then the door opened slowly , and there Netta . She simply stood in the doorway , staring tit way . Hadley nudged Josh and , haltingly , they wal closer . Netta continued to stare , her bright bloc c so much like Angus 's , moving little by little over cI ' inch of Hadley and Josh , seeming to find them 1,1% nating . No one spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally Netta said , " You 're the ones . . . who eat t1 before . " Yes , " Hadley answered , glad for the silence to broken . " We came the other night . Halloween . " " What are your names ? " asked Netta . " I 'm Hadley . Hadley Patterson . " " And I 'm Josh Carter . " " Netta . Short for Henrietta , " the woman sat briskly . " Netta Tull . " " Pleased to meet you , " Hadley and Josh said polite ) They stared at one another for several ma moments , again without speaking . Hadley was s prised by her first good look at Netta . The woman bent over , so much that she stood no higher than Josh 's four feet , eight inches . Hadley stood about head taller . And , as Hadley had tried to describe t Josh , Netta 's back was hunched so that her head hung  | Forward from her neck . The hump on her back looked , Hadley thought , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . Her long hair was n't hanging free , as it had been on Halloween night , but was wilted into a neat bun at the back of her neck . She ore an old-fashionedlooking dress in a faded flower tint and heavy black woolen stockings . What surrised Hadley was that the " horrible hag " was n't horrible at all . Except for her hump , which Hadley was already growing used to , she appeared very much like other older women Hadley saw every day . Still Netta stared , almost hungrily , as if she could n't ct enough of looking . Maybe if I had n't laid eyes on another human being besides Angus for fifty-seven years , I 'd stare , too , thought Hadley . " W-we 're sorry we ran away the other night , " I ladley stammered . " It was the cats . " " They scared us to death when they started screech-ing , " Josh added . " You do n't have to lie , " said Netta brusquely . " I know what I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " W-what do you mean ? " she asked . " I 'm grotesque . Children are frightened of me . I know it quite well , " Netta answered , her blue eyes flashing . Iladley shook her head . She looked at Josh , not knowing how to explain . " No , it was n't that , " she said . " We could n't even see you , not really , " said Josh . " You 're notgrotesque , " said Hadley .  | " We just had the jitters because of all the stories about you , and it was dark , and then the cats started screeching , " Josh went on . Netta gave him a sidelong glance . " What are the stories about me ? " Hadley 's heart sank . Why had Josh said that ? They could n't tell Netta what people said about her . " Come , come , " urged Netta . " I know my brothel has been telling stories to keep you children away . I 've always wondered what he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Hadley answered . " I mean , no . Well , we guessed he was , " she finished lamely . Netta looked at Hadley slyly . " You guessed , sit ' Well ? " " Well , what ? " Hadley asked , feeling thoroughly con-fused . " What are the stories about me ? Come , child , tell me . " Hadley looked at Josh . Josh began reluctantly . " They say " He stopped . Netta looked at them impatiently . Hadley said as quickly as she could , " They say you turn people into black cats . They say you have a hear of stone . " She stared down at the ground after tins awful confession , wondering what Netta would do , and was surprised to hear her laugh . It was an odd sound , like dry leaves skittering over the sidewalk . A heart of stone , you say ! Why , I never gave Angus credit for that much imagination . " She laughed again  | ' After all this time , I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my . " Hadley continued staring at the ground , wishing t hey had never come . " What were you thinking of , coming here after hearing such stories ? " Netta asked . Hadley could feel Netta 's eyes staring intently . " I beg your pardon , ma'am ? " she asked . " Why did you come here ? And please do n't call me ma'am . I 've told you my name . " " We came to find out who lived up here , " Josh said . " I can see the light from my bedroom window , and I knew someone must be here . I knew there was no such person as the horrible hag , ' but " She stopped , aghast , hoping that Netta had n't heard . But of course she had . " The horrible hag ' ? Is that what they call me ? " she asked . " Yes , ma ' Yes , Netta , " Hadley answered miserably , wishing more than ever that they had never set foot on I Hogback Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were curious ? To sec this hag ? " Josh shrugged . " I guess so . I mean , we just wanted t o know the truth . " " Ah , the truth , " commented Netta . Then , sharply , " And what brought you back ? " " Well , we knew that someone must visit you because of the Three Musketeers bars , " Josh replied . " Oh , yes , " said Netta , and to the children 's surprise ,  | she grinned . " I put those out for Angus , as a sort joke , I guess . I saw the flashlight beam and thought he was coming , though I could n't imagine why , at that time of night . Of course , I never thought it would I the two of you . I suppose you realize you gave ii quite a fright . " Hadley nodded . And then you wanted to know who was supply ' me with candy bars , is that it ? " Netta continued . " Yes , " replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn of the hill , but we did n't see anybody . " Hadley decided to tell the whole story and get it over with . " So I came back by myself . I waited down there " she pointed down the hill " in those tree until Angus came . Then I followed him up here , heard some of your conversation , " she confessed . ' A I decided to come back . " " Why ? " asked Netta quietly . " Angus said you come to torment me . " " No ! " cried Hadley . " I came because I thought you sounded nice . Because you did n't seem anythingg like those old stories Angus told . Or anything like in in dreams . " Josh and Netta were both looking at her curious All at once she remembered the brownies . " Here , " she said , digging through her pack until found the shiny package , which she handed to Netta " I brought you these . " Netta took the package and opened it . " I made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face got a funny kind of crumply look . " I was right about you , " she said slowly . She turned and opened the door . " Wo n't you come in , Hadley Patterson and Josh Carter , and visit with me ? "  | Netta held the door as Hadley and Josh stepped into the cabin . Hadley had n't given any thought to what the inside of the house might be like , but it was more wonderful than anything she could have imagined . " It 's like living in a tree house ! " Josh exclaimed . Netta looked pleased . There were windows everywhere , so the sky filled the room in all directions . But what fascinated Hadley was the oddest and most beautiful furniture she had ever seen . The flat surfaces of the tables and chairs were made from narrow wooden boards , but the legs and arms were made from tree branches of all different sizes , with the bark still on them . Curved branches had been added for decoration , giving the furniture the look of graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and chairs . " It 's like furniture elves would have , " she said delightedly , " or fairies ! " Next to one of the large windows stood an easel and some paints and brushes . On the easel was a canvas . Hadley walked closer and saw that the painting was of the view from the window . It showed the town of  | Possum Hollow , far below , looking like some distant otherworld . There were paintings and books everywhere in the little room . Hundreds and hundreds of books filled the shelves , overflowed onto the tables , and spilled into piles in the corners . Every inch of the walls that was n't taken by a window or a bookshelf was covered with a painting . Immediately , Hadley recognized a portrait of Angus . There were other portraits , of people she did n't know , and paintings of all sorts of animals : Netta 's cats , the wild birds , deer , rabbits , and coyotes who shared Hogback Hill with Netta . Netta stood without speaking as Josh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young man with Angus 's bright blue eyes and the same determined set to his mouth . " Is that Angus ? When he was young ? " she asked . " Yes , " answered Netta . " Handsome , was n't he ? " And this is just the way he looks now , " Josh said , pointing to a recent likeness . " It shows that stubborn streak of his , does n't it ? Maybe that 's why he does n't care for it . Angus thinks my painting is silly . He says it 's a waste of time . " She laughed her short laugh . " But I tell him , if there 's one thing I have , it 's time . If it were n't for my books and paints , I 'd probably be stark , raving mad . " She stopped for a moment and added , " Maybe I am , at that . " Hadley smiled and shook her head , but she wished Netta would n't say such things .  | " Who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a portrait of a lovely young woman . Hadley and Josh stepped closer to get a better look . " It 's you , is n't it ? " asked Josh . " You were beautiful , " said Hadley . " Ha ! " Netta snorted . " Oh , I was n't hard to look at , I suppose , but that was before " She broke off , brushed a strand of stray hair away from her face , and shook her head . There was a long moment when no one spoke . Then , turning back , Netta asked , " Shall we have those brownies now ? " Josh nodded eagerly . " Sure , " Hadley said . Netta got some milk from an old ice chest . " Milk goes best with brownies , do n't you think ? " Hadley and Josh nodded , and Netta poured them each a glass . Hadley noticed that there were only two chairs . She and Josh stood uncertainly , until Netta perched herself on top of the ice chest . She pointed t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not equipped for company , as you can see . While they ate , Netta continued to stare at them iii a way that would have been rude if she had been anyone else . But Netta , unused to visitors as she was , seemed simply amazed to find herself sharing brownies with two eleven-year-old children . Suddenly Netta said , " I suppose you find this all very peculiar . " " It 's nice here , " Hadley answered honestly . " But I wonder why , well , why you 're here . " " For fifty-seven years , " Josh added .  | " That , children , is a very long story . " Netta stood up and started clearing away the glasses and plates . " And you had better start home now , had n't you ? It gets dark so early these days . Did you find Angus 's path ? " " Yes , " said Hadley . " Smart , " Netta said approvingly . They walked to the door and stopped . " Well , " said Josh awkwardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Netta . " Good-bye , Netta , " said Hadley . " Thank you for the brownies , " said Netta . They stepped through the door and began walking away from the cabin . Hadley turned back and asked , " Would it be all right if we came back to see you ? I mean , we wo n't " " If you do n't want us to , " finished Josh . Netta 's eyes searched their faces . " Would you really like to come back ? " she asked . Hadley and Josh looked at each other , then nodded . " Yes . " " You come anytime you want , " Netta said . She laughed her dry laugh . " I 'll be here . " " Uh ... what about Angus ? " asked Josh . " He wo n't like it very much , will he ? " " Do n't you worry about Angus , " replied Netta . " I 'll take care of him . " Hadley and Josh smiled , imagining Netta giving Angus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you ? " she asked sud-denly . " What ? " asked Josh.  | " What others ? " echoed Hadley . " No , you 're not . I can see that . I wonder why Angus ca n't see that ? Never mind . Be careful on that hill now " " We will , " promised Josh . " Bye , " called Hadley . They started down the hill in the twilight . When they turned to look back , Netta stood framed in thy doorway , as she had been the night that they first saw her , waving good-bye . " She 's nice ! " Josh said . " I know , " said Hadley in a puzzled voice . " It makes the whole thing even stranger , do n't you think ? It would almost make sense if she was like Angus says she is . But she 's not . I mean , she 's a hunchback , but big deal . After a while , you do n't even notice it . " " But she thinks she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I wonder why . And I 'm curious about what she meant when she said she was n't hard to look at , but that was before . ' Before what ? " " Yeah , " continued Josh , " and what about when she said you and I are different , not like the others ? What others ? " " I want to find out , " Hadley said fiercely , turning to Josh . " I want to know what happened before and who the others are and what the long story is . I want to know why a nice lady like Netta is up there all alone . " " Remember you heard Angus say something about how children are cruel ? " asked Josh . Hadley had been thinking about that , too . " Yeah . It makes me wonder what happened .... "  | They left the secret path and walked until they reached the sidewalk . Looking about for signs of Angus , Hadley said , " Do you want to go back tomorrow ? " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet lesson at four . " " Oh , " said Hadley . She felt anxious to see Netta again soon . " Would you care if I went without you ? " Josh thought for a minute . " No , I guess not , " he answered . " But tell her why I could n't come . I do n't want her to think it 's because I did n't like heror thought she was grotesque . " Hadley smiled at Josh . " I 'll tell her , " she said .  | The next day , when Hadley stepped into the clearing outside Netta 's house , the door opened immediately . " You just missed Angus , " Netta called . " Did you meet him on the path ? " " No , " said Hadley . " That 's strange . " Netta frowned . " He only left five minutes ago . In a bit of a black humor , I 'm afraid . " " Because of Josh and me ? " asked Hadley . " 11c does n't like us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , Hadley , " said Netta with a sigh . " The way he was carrying on , I wonder if he 's taken leave of his senses . I ca n't seem to convince him that you mean me no harm . At his age , I do n't like to see him get so agitated . " " He is pretty old , " Hadley said . " Yes . Old and tired . Tired of living , I do believe . " Then her face brightened . " I 'm very glad to see you , " she said , smiling . " Where 's your friend Josh ? " " He wanted me to tell you he 'll come to see you soon , but he had a trumpet lesson today . " " Well , that 's very important . Music and painting and reading are some of my greatest pleasures . I tell  | Angus that 's what he needs , something to do , something to take his mind off the past . He says I 'm a fine one to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind all that . Wo n't you come it ? It 's gotten rather chilly , and I have a nice fire going . " They went into the little cabin . Netta put another log in the wood stove and asked , " Would you like some tea ? " " Yes , please , " said Hadley . " With honey ? " asked Netta . Hadley nodded . Then she found herself blurting , " Netta ? Would you tell me the story ? About why you 're here ? " As soon as she had spoken , she felt herself blushing furiously . She was sure Netta would turn away , tell her to mind her own business , or say that she would n't understand . But Netta just looked at Hadley for a long moment . Then she said , " Why ? " It was such a simple question , but Hadley did n't know how to answer it . How could she explain the way the light on Hogback Hill had seemed to shine , night after night , into her thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound through her dreams , how that woman had become tangled up in Hadley 's mind with her mother ? How could she explain that in some way she hoped that Netta 's story would help her understand her own ? " Because I 've wondered about you for so long , " said Hadley , as honestly as she could . Netta poured two cups of tea , added honey , and said , " Milk ? "  | Hadley nodded . Netta moved slowly , taking her time preparing the tea . Finally , handing a cup to Hadley , she settled into the rocking chair across from the chair where Hadley sat . She blew thoughtfully at the tea to cool it . She was , Hadley thought , deciding how to start . " You want to know why I came here , and why I 've stayed all these years , " she said . " I can see why you 'd wonder . It 's an unusual story , I suppose , to others , but to me . . . Well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time ago . . . . " She paused , and Hadley knew her mind was traveling back , remembering . Netta began haltingly , with long pauses between sentences . " It was 1936 . Angus was twenty-four then , and I was sixteen . Angus was about to be married to his sweetheart ; Mary Eliza O'Toole was her name . Oh , Angus was full of beans , he was , back in those days . Handsome , wild , cocky as could be . He turned all the young ladies ' heads . But Mary Eliza put an end to Angus 's roguish ways , indeed she did . He took one look at that china-doll face of hers and fell head over heels in love . He 'd only known her for a month when he asked her to marry him , and she agreed . " Now , I was only sixteen , but I had my doubts about Mary Eliza from the first . When I looked into those big , blue , china-doll eyes , I felt I was looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think for a minute that she cared for Angus the way he cared for her . " Well , one day about two weeks before the wedding ,  | we packed a picnic lunch , and my mother and Angus and Imy father died in the First World Warwent for a ride over to Rockybottom Creek . We had recently bought our first automobile , and Angus was always looking for excuses to drive it . " " I 've been to Rockybottom Creek , " Hadley said . " It 's pretty there . " Netta seemed startled to hear Hadley speak , as if she had forgotten Hadley 's presence in the rush of memories . " It certainly was lovely that day , " Netta continued . " It was one of the first warm days of spring , and the creek was running hard from the melted snow , and the birds were singing . We ate and we napped in the sun and then , inevitably , I guess , talk turned to the upcoming wedding . " I 've never been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Angus if there was any harm in waiting a little longer , until he and Mary Eliza knew each other better . I remember I thought that Mama was right , and that if some time went by , Angus would discover what we could see so plainly , that Mary Eliza did n't love him . I did n't want Angus to make a mistake , you see , and get hurt . " But Angus did n't take it that way at all . He got himself all worked up about it . How dared we speak against Mary Eliza ! He said she had warned him we would try to come between them . She had him all twisted up against us , you see . Maybe Mama should n't have said anything , but she spoke out of love and con-  | cern for her son . It 's just that Angus was so blindly in love , he could n't see anything but Mary Eliza and what she wanted him to see . " Hadley thought suddenly of her mother saying how she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley hoped she would never be " madly " in love . It seemed to make people do foolish things . " The picnic was ruined , of course , " Netta went on . " Angus was furious . You 've seen that temper of his . He threw the blanket and picnic hamper into the car and called to us to get in ; he was leaving . So we did . We felt awful . Mama was apologizing and trying to explain , but Angus was acting like a crazy man . He had that car going full speed down that twisty , muddy road . Mama and I were frightened to death and were crying out for him to slow down , when he lost control of the car on a curve and smashed into a tree . " There was a silence as the echo of the crash seemed to reverberate through the little house . Netta stared out the window , seeing , Hadley knew , not the sky outside but the events of that long-ago afternoon . Netta rose shakily and offered more tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been too absorbed in Netta 's story to drink it . Netta continued quietly . " Mama died . I had what the doctors called a compression fracture of the spine , but I did n't know that for a long , long time . For weeks I was out of my mind . They said I had a head injury , but part of it was that , deep down inside , I knew that  | something awful had happened , and I did n't want to wake up and face it . " When I did come to my senses , I was in a great deal of pain . I was in my own bed at home , but it did n't feel like home anymore . Angus had married Mary Eliza after the accident , and it became clear to me right away that I was an unwelcome visitor in what was now their house . " I slowly realized , too , that it was painful for Angus to have me around . He tried to hide it , of course , but he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been ever since , a reminder to him of what he did that day . " Netta 's gaze traveled slowly from the window to rest on Hadley 's face . " Oh , my , " she said . " I 'm sorry , dear . This is n't a very happy story . " " But why did you come up here ? " asked Hadley . " I had nowhere else to go , " Netta answered simply . " Why not ? " said Hadley . " You could have lived lots of places . " " Oh , how to explain this to you ? " wondered Netta . " You see this hump on my back , do n't you ? " " Yes , but " " For some reason you 're not horrified by itor by me . " " No , " answered Hadley . " Why should I be ? " " But the other children in town are frightened by the stories about me , are n't they ? Frightened and dis-gusted ? " " But they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've never seen you . They 've just heard those awful stories . " She felt a sudden surge of anger at Angus . What reason could he have for saying such things ? And what do you suppose they would think of me if they did see me ? " Netta persisted . " But you 're nothing like Angus says ! " cried Hadley . " Why does he say such stupid things ? " " Let me tell you the rest of the story , and maybe you 'll understand why I did what I did , " Netta said . " As the months went by , my back grew worse and worse . The fractured bones in my spine tightened up more and more , and I began to grow stooped . It was painful , and I was trying to learn how to live with that . Now , before the accident , I 'd had a beaudid I tell you that ? " Hadley shook her head . " His name was Thomas . Oh , our romance was n't serious , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . One day when I was well enough , Thomas came to call . We went for a walk . Looking back , I see that Thomas acted quiet and strange when he saw me , but I was so glad to see him and to be up and about that I guess I did n't pay too much attention . A group of children began following us down the street . She 's a hunchback ! ' they shouted . They followed along behind us , calling , Thomas loves a hunchback ! Thomas loves a hunchback ! ' " I was so humiliated . I ran to my room and hid there . Later , I overheard Mary Eliza talking to Angus.  | She said , You see , Angus , the effect she has on people . She gives me the shivers . I do n't know how much longer I can bear having her in the house . ' " " That 's ridiculous ! " Hadley broke in . " She was just being mean ! " " That 's what I kept waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the mirror and saw myself as I imagined others saw me : misshapen , hideous , a horror . I knew Thomas would never be back . I compared myself to that perfect little china doll , and I knew that I would never be loved by anyone . I kept hearing those children 's shouts , and I told myself I would never let that happen to me again . " The next day I went to Angus and told him I wanted to go away somewhere , anywhere , where no one could ever ridicule me again . A part of me was waiting for Angus to tell me I was being silly , that I did n't look so bad , and that those children were just being children . But instead he looked at me and said that it would probably be best for everybody if I left . It was a way , you see , to keep peace with Mary Eliza . " He was the one who suggested that I come here . Our parents had owned the land and built this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit .... " Netta stared down at the tea in her cup for a long time . Angus told everyone I was going away to a hospital in Chicago . Later , he began making up stories to keep curious children away . And so , here I 've been , for all these years .... " Hadley struggled with her thoughts . She found her-  | self filled with fury at Angus . " How could Angus do that to you ? You must hate him . I hate him ! " Netta looked at Hadley with obvious surprise . " Hate him ? No , I do n't hate him . Angus 's life has n't been easy . He 's had to live with himself and what he did . And Mary Eliza , I 'm afraid , was n't much consolation . He did n't have a moment 's peace with her . As it turned out , she soon found someone a little more handsome and a little richer than Angus , and that was the end of that . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you were some kind ofmonster . He wrecked your whole life . " " Hush , now , it 's too late for all that , " Netta said . " But you do n't have to live up here anymore . You could live with me and my mom , " Hadley offered eagerly . " That 's kind of you , Hadley , but do n't you see ? I was the one who wanted to come here . I could have come down anytime I wanted to . I was n't Angus 's prisoner . But I 've grown used to it here . It 's my home . The birch and the deer and the coyotes , they accept me the way I am . " Netta fussed nervously with her hair for a moment , tucking loose strands into the bun at the back of her neck . Hadley could see that her suggestion that Netta leave Hogback Hill had made Netta uncomfortable . " Is there anything you want me to do ? Can I bring you anything when I come again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netta replied , " but I 'm fine for now . Angus always leaves me with much more than I need . It 's part of his guilt . " She gave Hadley a conspiratorial grin . " Will you be coming back soon ? " she asked . " And your friend Josh ? " " We 'll come anytime you want , " answered Hadley . " Well , you and Josh have many things to do other than to visit an old lady like me , " said Netta . " Come when you can . As I said , I 'll be here . " " Okay , " said Hadley . " Well , bye . " She began walking to the door . Then , surprising herself , she turned back and kissed Netta softly on her weathered cheek . " Thank you , " she said , " for telling me. "  | As Hadley stepped into the clearing , she zipped her jacket against the cold wind that was sweeping down Hogback Hill , making the bare branches of the trees rattle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heard the crunch of dried leaves and the snap of twigs under her feet , the pine boughs that sighed and rustled as she passed , and she noticed that the shadows were deepening all around her . Then one of the shadows moved . Hadley stifled a scream as a dusky shape emerged from the darkness and stood before her in the path . She could n't make out a face , just a glimmer of pale white hair and two white eyebrows . Angus ! Hadley stood motionless . She knew he saw her , had known she was coming , had been waiting for her to come down the path . Why did he just stand there , silent and threatening ? Hadley remembered Netta 's voice saying , " I wonder if he 's taken leave of his sens-es . " She pushed the thought away . When Angus did speak , his voice sounded thick and strangled . " You , " he growled , " keep away from here .  | Stay off this hill . We do n't want you . You or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering back , " Netta does want us . " " Leave her be ! " Angus commanded . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . Damned brat ! " " Netta wants us to come see her , " said Hadley . " She said so . " " No ! She does n't . She ca n't . She 's different . Ca n't you see ? Leave her be ! " Angus shouted , his voice growing shrill and strained . Hadley did n't want to talk to Angus anymore . And she did n't want to stand on the dark hillside with him any longer . She ducked her head and began to run as fast as she could . With her arms flailing , she pushed Angus aside , rushed past him , and went running down the path . Her heart was banging in her throat as she imagined Angus 's footsteps behind her . She thought she could feel his breath on her neck even as she heard his curses fading far behind her . She ran and ran until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fumbling for the key , she opened the door , slammed it shut , and stood panting on the other side . As soon as she could breathe normally , she went to the phone and called Josh . " He 's crazy ! " Josh said when she told him of her encounter with Angus . " He 's nuts . A lunatic ! Are you okay ? " " I guess so , " Hadley answered . " But wait . There 's more . Netta told me everything . "  | Ad Hadley told Josh Netta 's story . When she had finished , Josh was quiet for a while . Then he said hotly , " It 's all Angus 's fault . " " I know , " said Hadley . " The accident was bad enough , " Josh continued , " but afterward , when she wanted to go up there to live , he should have told her not to pay any attention to what those stupid kids said . They were just being jerks ! " " I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even worse than the kids . He made her go up there , and now she 's so used to it , she might never come down . " " Yeah . Hey , does she really want us to go back ? " " Yes , " Hadley answered . " Do you want to go tomorrow ? " " I ca n't , " said Josh . " I have to finish my science project . How about the next day ? " " I have an appointment with your dad , " said Hadley . " Okay , " said Josh . " We 'll go Friday . " " Perfect ! " said Hadley . " We have the day off , remember ? Teacher conferences . " All right ! " exclaimed Josh happily .  | When Hadley left Dr. Carter 's office on Thursday afternoon , she wondered if she would ever be able to speak like a normal person again . Dr. Carter had shown her the wire he used along her top front teeth , so she knew that it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between her lip and her teeth . The piece of plastic that was molded against the roof of her mouth made her feel as if she had four pieces of bubble gum stuck up there . The contraption was , Dr. Carter had explained , a bite plate , which she would wear for several weeks before getting her braces . Braces ! Hadley did n't think there was room in her mouth for anything else . She was so busy exploring the bite plate with her tongue that she did n't hear Josh when he ran up behind her . " Josh ! " she exclaimed , except it came out sounding kind of funny . " You scared me to death . " " What ? " asked Josh . " Oh , I forgot . You got a bite plate . Never mind . You 'll get used to it . But , Hadley , listen , did you hear ? I can hardly believe it ! Just when "  | " What are you talking about ? " asked Hadley . " Did hear what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way her words sounded . Maybe she wonld n't talk anymore until she got her braces off . How long di that take ? Two years ? Three ? But Josh seemed to have understood her we enough . " About Angus . He 's dead . He died this morning . guess he had a heart attack . I just heard it at Larsen 's . Angus is dead ? " Hadley repeated stupidly . " He can be dead . " " Well , he is , " said Josh . " I just saw him yesterday , " Hadley said , as if t ha made it impossible for Angus to be dead . She felt peculiar feeling in her stomach . She had never know anyone who had died . " It 's creepy , is n't it ? " Josh went on . " After the way he ambushed you yesterday on the way home fro Netta 's ? " Hadley was still having trouble believing that Angus was dead , but when Josh 's words sank in she suddenly cried , " Netta ! Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't knowhow could she ? We 'll have to tell her . We 'd better go now . " " Wait a second , " said Josh . " It 's already dark Hadley . We ca n't go now . My mom wo n't let me , for one thing . There 's no school tomorrow , remember ? We can go first thing in the morning . " Hadley nodded , realizing the sense of what Josh w saying . Netta would be all right until morning . " hot what will she do without Angus ? " she said .  | " Well , " said Josh , " she 's got us . " Yes , " said Hadley , " you 're right . She 's got us . But " " Look , I 've got to go , " said Josh . " Dinner was almost ready when I came to find you . I 'll be over first thing in the morning , okay ? " " Okay , " Hadley answered . " And Hadley ? You 're talking better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley smiled to herself . She had forgotten all about her bite plate . On the way home , her tongue worried the roof of her mouth , and thoughts of Netta and Angus worried her mind . She did n't really feel sorry that Angus was dead . She had n't known him well , and what she had known of him was n't very nice . But what would Netta do now that Angus was dead ? It was frightening to think that , except for her and Josh , no one in the world knew about Netta.  | " What on earth ? " Netta exclaimed whet Hadley and Josh arrived at her door the next morning . " What are you two doing here ? I 've been out of touch , I know , but unless I ' 1 mistaken , Friday is a school day . " " Parent-teacher conferences , " Josh explained as h and Hadley followed Netta inside . " Ah , " said Netta . " Well , how lucky for me . May I offer you some tea ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and Josh had decided it would be best to get right to the point . " We Well , we came to tell you something . " " Something serious , by the looks on your faces , Netta said . " Yes , " Josh said . " It 's about Angus . " " He died , Netta , " said Hadley . " Yesterday morning . " Netta 's hand went to her throat . " Was it his heart ? " she asked quietly . Hadley nodded . Netta rose and began fussing with the teapot . " always worried about his heart , " she said . Then , as if t u herself , she murmured , " Poor Angus . Maybe he 's found some peace at last . "  | Hadley felt confused by Netta 's calmness . She looked at Josh , and he shrugged . Are n't you sad ? " she asked Netta . " What ? " said Netta . " Oh , yes . When I think of Angus , there 's a lot to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . And he was tired . Tired of coming up here , tired of keeping our little secret . He wanted me to come down and enter some kind of home so he 'd be relieved of the responsibility for me , but I would n't hear of it . He was simply tired of living his life , I believe . It was n't a very happy one . " " You wo n't have to go to a home , will you ? " asked Hadley . " They ca n't make you , can they ? " Josh added , " Because Hadley and I were talking about it , and we can help you now like Angus did . We can bring you whatever you need . " And everything will be like before , " Hadley said eagerly . " No , children , " said Netta gently . " I do n't know what will happen now , but I do know that everything will not be like before : Things will change . They 'll have to . " She paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " Hadley and Josh were silent . Netta turned to them and smiled briefly . " It was good of you to come , " she said . And I appreciate your offer of help . Right now I need some time to think . Some time to do my mourning for Angus . Some time to decide what to do next . " " Do you need any supplies ? " Josh asked . " No , thank you , " answered Netta . " I 'm fine for now . But would you be able to come back sometime soon ? "  | " We 'll come whenever you say , " Hadley offered . " Would tomorrow be all right ? " Netta asked . " Sure , " Josh said . " It 's Saturday . " " We 'll come , " Hadley said . " Thank you , " said Netta as she sat down in the rocking chair . Hadley and Josh said good-bye softly and crept out the door , leaving Netta rocking back and forth , staring out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley got home that evening , there was a note from her mother . Hadley , sweetie , hope your teeth are feeling better today . I 'll see you tomorrow morning before I go to work . Good newswho says miracles never happen ? I have Sunday off again . Love , Mom The following morning , as Hadley and her mother ate breakfast , her mother asked , " Well , what are you going to do with yourself today ? " Hadley hardly knew where to begin . She had n't had a chance to tell her mother anything about Netta , or Angusor anything that had been happening ever since she and Josh had first become interested in Hogback Hill . " Well , " she said , " Josh and I have to go up Hogback Hill in a little while . He 's coming over soon . " " Oh , " said Mrs. Patterson . " I really should meet this friend Josh you 've been spending so much time with . What are you two going to do on Hogback Hill ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did n't  | you tell me everyone thinks it 's haunted or some thing ? " " It 's kind of a long story , " Hadley began and , takin a deep breath , she tried to tell her mother about Netta , about how she and Josh had discovered her , and about everything that had happened since . When she finished , her mother looked utterly astonished . " Hadley , " Mrs. Patterson said finally , " t his makes me feel very peculiar . All this has been going on in your life , and I did n't know a thing about it . " Hadley wiggled uncomfortably in her chair . " Well , " she ventured , " there never seemed to be time to tell you . " " I 'm not sure I would have been happy if I had known about it , " continued Mrs. Patterson . " But now Well , Angus is dead , and Netta sounds perfectly harmless . " " She is , " Hadley reassured her mother . " I ca n't believe I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you think Netta will do now ? " asked Mrs. Patterson thoughtfully . " I do n't know , " answered Hadley . " She said she needed time to think . We told her we 'd bring her stuff like Angus used to , if she wanted us to , so she can stay on Hogback Hill . " " Are you sure you want to do that ? " asked Mrs. Patterson . " It would be an awfully big responsibility . " " We do n't mind , " said Hadley eagerly . " We really like her . And it 's nice on Hogback Hill . You should see her little house , Mom . "  | " Maybe I will someday , " said Mrs. Patterson . She was quiet for a moment . Then she asked softly , " It was Netta you were talking about the other day , was n't it ? When you asked me why someone would live the way she has . " Hadley nodded . And I assumed you were talking about me . " Hadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a laugh . " Maybe someday the kids will be making up stories about me . The horrible hag of Possum Hollow . " " Mom ! " said Hadley . " I 'm sorry , Had . I should n't joke . It 's just that I feel as if you 've held a mirror up to my face . And I 'm not sure I like what I see . " Hadley did n't know what to say . " Netta 's nice , Mom . You 'd like her . " " I 'm sure I would , " said Mrs. Patterson . " Mom ? " said Hadley . " Yes , sweetie ? " Before Hadley could say anything else , there was a knock at the door . " That must be Josh , " she said , getting up from the table . She returned to the kitchen with Josh . " Hello , Josh , " said Mrs. Patterson . " You 're home ! " Josh said . Then he blushed deeply , saying , " I mean , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley 's mother laughed ruefully . " It 's nice to meet you , too , Josh . It sounds like you and Hadley have been having a very exciting time . " " I told her about Netta , " Hadley explained .  | " I told my parents , too , " said Josh . " They say it 's okay if I take things to Netta , but they want to meet her . How are we going to work that ? " " We 'll have to see what Netta says , I guess , " said Hadley . " Maybe she would n't mind if they came up . You , too , Mom . " " We 'll see , " said Mrs. Patterson . " Right now I had better get ready for work . " Josh helped Hadley clean up the kitchen . Then they called good-bye to Hadley 's mother and started up the now-familiar path to Netta 's house .  | When they reached the top of the hill , Netta came to the cabin door , paintbrush in hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to be further along before you came . Never mind . Come in , come in . You might as well see it now " Hadley and Josh stepped into the cabin to see what Netta had been working on . Their eyes were immediately drawn to a half-finished portrait on the easel . " It 's us ! " Josh cried delightedly . " How did you do it ? " Hadley asked with amazement . " I thought people had to sit for hours and hours for portraits . It looks just like us . And we were n't even here ! " Netta looked pleased . " Goodness , " she said . " If I waited for someone to sit here for hours , I 'd never paint a picture . I look closely at things and paint from my memory . Why , you did n't suppose the birds and the deer and the coyotes came and posed for me , did you ? " Hadley looked curiously at Netta . She had expected Netta to be quiet , perhaps even gloomy , but instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always do my best thinking when I 'm painting , " Netta went on gaily . " What have you been thinking about ? " asked Josh . " Oh , many , many things , " said Netta . " I was up most of the night thinking . And yet I do n't feel a bit tired . Would you like to hear what I 've decided ? " " Yes , " Hadley and Josh answered . " Sit , sit , " urged Netta . She had been waving the paintbrush about as she spoke , and she put it in a jar of mineral spirits before coming over to perch on the ice chest . But she was too excited to sit still , and soon she got up again , walking around the room as she spoke . Angus had a will , of course , " she began . " He kept it with a lawyer in town , Henry Updyke . Do you know him ? " " I know who he is , " said Hadley . " He 's real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I expect Henry is in something of a dither right now . He 'll be needing to see me about Angus 's estate , and I do n't imagine old Henry is too keen on climbing up this hill . He 's the only soul , other than the two of you , who knows I 'm up here . So the first thing I shall have to do is go to see Henry . " " Go to see Henry ? " Josh repeated . " In town ? " Hadley asked in astonishment . " Yes , " said Netta , plainly enjoying the effect of her words . In town . " Hadley and Josh stared , dumbfounded , as she went on . " Now , I appreciate the two of you offering to come up here to bring me supplies . And what I would like to  | do , if you are still willing , is have you do just that during the summer months . For my plan , you see , is to live in Angus 's house during the really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to live here the rest of the year . If , of course , there is still enough money from my parents ' estate , and I am quite certain that there is . " Hadley and Josh sat in stunned silence , as Netta went to the dresser and began pulling clothing from the drawers . " I imagine we should be on our way soon , do n't you ? I 'll just take enough things for a day or two , until I can see Henry and put things in order , and then I 'll be back to close up for the winter . I have to think of how to move the cats . Well , never mind that for now . They 'll be fine for one or two days . " Hadley stared at Josh in amazement . " Netta , " she said , " I thought you would n't ever leave Hogback Hill . " " I thought so , too , " Netta replied as she tucked her clothes into a small cloth bag . " But all that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town for good ? " asked Hadley . It was Netta 's turn to look astonished . " Because , " she answered , " I like it here . " She paused . " But it 's different now . I 'll live here when I care to , not because I feel I must . Not because I 'm frightened . " For Hadley it was as if a spell had been broken . She remembered the morning she had imagined Netta as Rapunzel in her tower , or the Sleeping Beauty waiting  | to be awakened . " Once , before I knew you , I thought that you might be a fairy-tale princess under a spell , " she told Netta shyly . " I was under a spell , " Netta said . " For fifty-seven years .... " But no prince came along to wake you up , " Josh said , teasing . " No , " said Netta seriously . " It was you two who woke me . " Netta 's words filled Hadley with pleasure . " Us ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It made me think again , about things I had n't thought of for years . I began wondering about Possum Hollow and what it 's like now . I began thinking about people I knew who are still there , people like Ed and Emma Larsen . I began to ask myself what I was doing here . All of a sudden , what happened fifty-seven years ago began to seem very faraway and unimportant . This might sound silly , but I realized that the way I was living was just . . . habit . Angus and I kept playing our parts in a play that had no meaning anymore . But I could n't see that until the two of you came , bringing . . . bringing me the world . And Angus 's death made everything clearer . It 's time for me to come down from Hogback Hill . " Netta disappeared behind the curtain that separated her bedroom from the rest of the cabin . Josh and Hadley stared at each other for a moment , grinning . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt proud that she had played a part in Netta 's decision . Netta reappeared . " Which dress do you think I should wear ? I do n't suppose either one is quite the current fashion in Possum Hollow . " " They 're both nice , " said josh . " Maybe the blue one , " suggested Hadley . All right , " agreed Netta , stepping behind the curtain again . " Where do you want to go first when we get to town ? " asked Hadley . " To Larsen 's Market to get some things . Then to Angus 's house to get settled . I 'll give Henry Updyke a call so he can stop fretting . I 'm sure he 's fretting , knowing Henry . And then , well , we 'll just see . " " You have n't seen the house for a long time , " Josh said , then stopped . Hadley knew he was wondering if Netta was prepared for the house that josh had thought looked haunted . " No , " said Netta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess on my hands . Angus never was much of a housekeeperor a handyman . I do all the maintenance of this place myself . So I expect I have some cleaning to do , at the very least . " At the very least is right , thought Hadley . " We 'll help , " she offered . " Thank you , " said Netta as she filled bowls with food for the cats and set them out on the doorstep . " There . This place should be fine for a couple of days , and so should the cats . " She took a deep breath and  | said quietly , " I guess I 'm ready . " Picking up her cloth hag , she turned to Hadley and Josh . " Shall we go ? " Hadley thought , absurdly , that there ought to be a brass band playing , or a flourish of drums , or some kind of dramatic background music like in the movies , to add emphasis to such an important moment . But instead , she and Josh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing . Hadley remembered how she had felt the night she and Josh had climbed up the hill for the first time , and tried to imagine how it must feel to Netta to be going down for the first time in so long . Hadley and Josh each held one of Netta 's elbows when they reached the steep , graveled part of the hill-side . " Goodness , " exclaimed Netta . " I 'm going to have to get some of those sneakers you two are wearing . These old shoes of mine are slippery . " They reached the bottom of the hill and walked past the dump . When it was time to leave the deserted sidewalk , Hadley could feel Netta 's arm trembling in hers . Are you frightened ? " she asked . Netta considered this . " Yes , " she said finally . " But that 's all right . I 'll get over it , I expect . " Hadley clasped Netta 's elbow firmly , and they stepped out together onto the street . Netta peered anxiously ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A car passed by and Netta jumped away from the street , bumping Josh off the sidewalk . " So fast , " she murmured apologetically .  | As they turned onto East Street , a boy on a bicycle turned the corner , a sack of newspapers hanging from his shoulder . He rode up the sidewalk toward them , throwing papers onto the doorsteps . Hadley , felt Netta stiffen beside her . " Hi , Scott , " said Hadley as the boy drew near . " Hey , Hadley . Hey , Josh , how 's it going ? " said Scott as he flashed past . He turned around , started up the other side of the street , and , looking back , popped a wheelie . Hadley laughed . " Show-off , " she called . " That looks very difficult , " Netta said . " It 's not so hard , " said Josh . Grinning , he added , " I could teach you in no time . " " That boy did n't pay me any mind , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hadley could feel Netta 's grip on her arm begin to relax . Netta began looking about with interest and curiosity , asking questions about who lived in the houses they passed and exclaiming over how things had changed in fifty-seven years . At Larsen 's , Netta walked slowly down the aisles , putting some items into the cart and examining others with amazement . " Microwaveable . My , my , " she murmured . When she reached the meat counter , she said softly , " Hello , Emma . " Emma Larsen turned from the beef she was trimming and looked questioningly at Netta . Her puzzled look changed to one of recognition , then doubt , then awe . " Netta ? " she whispered . " My goodness , Henrietta Tull , is that really you ? "  | " Yes , " answered Netta . " It really is . " " Why , I can scarcely believe my own eyes , " said Mrs , Larsen , wiping her hands on her big white butcher 's apron and coming around in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come see who 's turned up after all these years ! " she called excitedly toward the front of the store . " What 's that , Emma ? " Mr. Larsen called back . " I 'll get him , " said Josh , heading for the front of the store , where Mr. Larsen sat at the counter . Hadley watched with interest as Netta and Mrs. Larsen and , finally , Mr. Larsen talked , the Larsens exclaiming over and over again at the remarkable fact of Netta 's presence . From time to time , they stopped and simply stared at Netta , shaking their heads . " I suppose you 've come for Angus 's funeral , " said Mr. Larsen . " Yes , " answered Netta , adding almost shyly , " I plan to be around quite a bit from now on . " " Well , that 's just splendid , " said Mr. Larsen , " just splendid . We 're going to miss Angus around here , the ornery son of a gun , but it 's good news to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good news , indeed . " Hadley could see that Mrs. Larsen was bursting with curiosity . " Netta , " she asked finally , " where have you kept yourself all these years ? Angus spoke of a hospital in Chicago , but we could never get too much out of him .... " " Emma , when I get settled , I 'll have you over for tea and we 'll catch up on all that , " said Netta . " Right now  | I 've got to get to the house and see what 's what , and give Henry Updyke a call to let him know I 'm here . " " I 'd like to see Henry 's face when he hears your voice on the telephone ! " Mr. Larsen laughed . Josh and Hadley each carried a bag of groceries to Angus'snow Netta'shouse . Hadley had been worried about what Netta would think when she saw the condition of the house , but Netta only said matter-offactly , " Angus never did know how to take care of any-thing . " After Netta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " Now you two should be on your way . I have calls to make , and you surely have better things to do on a Saturday than hang around this gloomy place . And I confess I 'm feeling a bit tired from all the excitement . You come back tomorrow if you like , and see what kind of progress I 've made cleaning this place up . " She refused their offers of help . Putting a hand on each of their shoulders , she said , " You 've done enough . Now scoot . " As Hadley and Josh walked down the street , Josh said , " But we did n't do anything . Netta did it herself . " " She says we broke the spell , " Hadley reminded him . " I guess you 're right , " said Josh . He struck a heroic pose . " Just call me Prince Charming . " Hadley laughed . " Fat chance ! "  | The next morning was Sunday . Hadley rose early and was surprised to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl , even though she had n't come home from work until one that morning . " Hi , Mom , " said Hadley . " I was going to make you breakfast . What are you doing up so early ? " " Morning , sweetie . I did n't sleep very well last night . To tell the truth , I was up all night . " Hadley had been up most of the night , too , thinking about Nettaand her mother . During the night it had come to her that if something could happen as astonishing as Netta 's leaving Hogback Hill , then maybe .. maybe other things could change , too . " Mom ? " " Yes , honey ? " " When Dad left , were you sad ? " Mrs. Patterson stared , surprised , at Hadley . " Yes , " she said . Her face stiffened . " But angry , and hurt and humiliated , too . Why ? " " Do you still feel that way ? " Hadley went on . Her mother sighed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . " I try not to spend very much time thinking about how I feel . " " But do you ? " Hadley persisted . " Why are you asking me this , Hadley ? " " Netta came down from Hogback Hill yesterday , " Hadley blurted . It was n't really an answer to her mother 's question , but it was all Hadley could think of to say . Mrs. Patterson 's eyebrows lifted in surprise . She waited for Hadley to continue . " WeJosh and Icould n't believe she 'd do it . But she said that living up there , hiding from everybody , had just become a habit . She said that she 'd been thinking , and all the things that happened fifty-seven years ago did n't seem to matter anymore . " A habit ? " murmured Mrs. Patterson . " She was scared when we came down the hill . When we started to cross the road , I could feel her arm shaking , but she did n't want to go back . " Her mother did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morn ? " Hadley said again as she moved closer to her mother and wrapped her arms around her . " Yes , honey ? " " Do you still feel the way you did when Dad left ? " Mrs. Patterson was quiet for a while , thinking . " You know , Hadley , " she said , " it 's funny . . . I 've spent all this time trying not to think or talk about your father and what happened between us . And now that you actually ask me how I feel about it , I find that I do n't  | feel very much at all anymore . It was so long ago . I guess I 'm not still mad , not really . I 'm just sorry . Sorry it turned out this way , for your sake . And sorry for him . Because he 'll never know what a great kid he has , " she said fiercely , hugging Hadley to her . Then she said , " You know , I could n't sleep last night because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? " asked Hadley . It was her turn to be sur-prised . " Yes . It made me uncomfortable to think that I was like her in some way . I did n't like it , but I did n't know what to do about it . Now you tell me what Netta has done , and " her voice had grown very low , until it almost seemed that she was talking to herself " maybe now it 's my turn .... " Hadley felt an odd excitement in the pit of her stomach . " What are you going to do ? " she asked . " II do n't know , " her mother replied . " That 's the hard part . " " Get to know some people in town ? " suggested Hadley . " Like who ? " " I do n't know . Like Josh 's parents . Like somebody to go on a date with . " A date ! " " Are n't you lonely , just working and coming home and working again ? Do n't you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth ? " exclaimed her mother . " Everybody is n't like Dad , you know , " said Hadley . " Josh 's father is real nice . "  | Mrs. Patterson laughed and said , " You 're not suggesting that I marry Josh 's dad , are you ? Would n't Josh 's mother have something to say about that ? " " Mom ! You know what I mean . " " I 'm only teasing , Had . I guess I do know what you mean . But what happened with your fatherI told myself I 'd never let it happen again . " " Mom , you said yourself , it was a long time ago . " " Well , maybe it 's hard for you to understand , but the very idea of going through that again scares me to death . What if it did n't work out ? " Hadley shrugged . " You 'd be stuck with me , I guess , " she said with a grin . Mrs. Patterson smiled , looking at Hadley and shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You went and grew up on me when I was n't looking . " Hadley glanced hopefully at the mirror that hung by the kitchen door to see what her mother meant , but she did n't look any different . She was still too tall , with too many freckles and crooked teeth . She looked away with a shrug . " Mom ? " " Yes ? " " How about getting a new job ? " " Why a new job ? " " Because I hate it when you 're working all the time , " said Hadley . " I do n't like being here alone , eating alone , going to bed alone . It 's no funand I 'm scared at night . " As she said that , Hadley realized that it was n't true anymore , not all of it . She was n't scared at night , not  | since she had climbed Hogback Hill . Once she 'd met Netta , the bad dreams had stopped . But the rest was true . " I never get to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table and started beating the eggs in the bowl nervously . " Goodness , Hadley , I 'd have to think about that . The job I have pays better than anything I thought I could get . " She stopped suddenly , her hand holding the fork over the half-beaten eggs . " You 'd really like it if I was around more ? " " Yes , " said Hadley , and then she laughed . " What 's so funny ? " asked her mother . " Oh , I was just thinking about Josh . He 'd think I was nuts , " she said . " Why ? " asked her mother . " He says he wishes his parents were n't home all the time so that he could do whatever he wants , " Hadley explained . " But Josh does n't always know what he 's talking about . "  | Two weeks later , Hadley and josh were walking home from Netta 's house on a clear , cold November night . The moon was rising , gleaming and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hogback Hill , its light reflecting off the fresh snow , making the hill shimmer with a quiet , peaceful beauty . No other light shone at the top , for Netta 's cabin was closed up tight , and she and her cats were settled into Angus 's old house for the winter . Josh and Hadley had been to Netta 's to deliver an invitation to a trim-the-Christmas-tree party at the Pattersons ' house . It had been Hadley 's idea . Her mother had been reluctant at first , but was soon caught up in Hadley 's enthusiasm . Netta was coming , of course , and Josh and Simon and their parents , and , Hadley reported excitedly to Josh , a man her mother knew from the Sheldrake . " A man ? " asked Josh . " Like a boyfriend ? " " I do n't know , " said Hadley . " He 's a customer who eats there all the time . Mom says just a friend . '  | " That 's what they always say , " said Josh wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best news is Mom told the owner of the Sheldrake yesterday that she was going to have to find a job with more normal hours . Mrs. McClearythat 's the ownerreally likes Mom and does n't want her to leave , so she and Mom are having a big powwow today . Mom did n't want to get her hopes up , but she thinks things might work out . " " That 's good , huh ? " said Josh . " Yes , " said Hadley . They walked along in silence for a moment . Then Hadley said , " Just thinkif we had n't decided to go up Hogback Hill on Halloween night , none of this would have happened . " " If we had n't decided ? " said Josh . " I seem to remember having to practically drag you up there . " " Okay , okay , " said Hadley , " I admit it . But after that , things around here sure started to change . " " They sure did , " agreed Josh . " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Like what ? " asked Hadley . " Like Simon , " Josh answered with disgust . " You want to hear his newest joke ? " " Sure . " Hadley laughed . " He says , Why did Netta cross the road ? ' ' And what 's the answer ? " asked Hadley . " To get to the other side . " Josh groaned . " So what 's wrong with that ? " asked Hadley . " So he finally gets the punchline right , but , as usual , the whole thing does n't make any sense . " " I do n't know about that , " said Hadley .  | Josh shook his head in exasperation . Hadley laughed again . " In fact , " she said softly , " it makes perfect sense to me. " 138
