Section : Off The Shelf Product Roundup <p> A new , smart type of pager that can interact with computers is becoming indispensable  --  on the farm and on the road . <p> Beepers , pocket-size devices that show you a caller 's phone number , have a new name and expanded capabilities . Now called alphanumeric pagers ( because they display both letters and numbers ) , the devices can come equipped with E-mail addresses . They interact with PCs and Macs in a variety of ways : They can receive short E-mail messages that you read on a four-line display panel . They can relay stock prices , weather reports , and sports scores ( from service providers that supply the information ) . And they can download text or financial data from the World Wide Web or from E-mail , sales-management programs , or spreadsheets running in your office . <p> As a result , alphas , as they are sometimes called , are becoming essential equipment for all types of executives on the go , not just doctors and delivery people . Alphas offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and customers and a simple way to keep abreast of news that may affect your business . <p> " My pager keeps me in touch with the world , " says George Silva Jr. , who runs a dairy farm in rural Turlock , Calif . With 2,200 milking cows in a herd 6,000 strong and a 30-employee business to run , the owner of the $1-million G. J. Silva and Son Dairy ca n't be tied to his office . <p> Silva , his two managers , and six other employees carry Motorola 's Advisor Gold FLX pagers ; he leases all nine for $117 a month from a local office of PageNet , the nation 's largest paging provider . The paging service allows the secretaries who monitor the office PCs and phones to send E-mail messages to Silva and his managers when important calls come in  --  from a major customer like Safeway , for example , which runs a chain of supermarkets . <p> The messages are relayed via PageMaster , a shareware wireless-messaging program from Omnitrend Software ( $49.95 ) that runs on all three office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Safeway order up 10% " and then E-mail it to each manager . Silva prefers PageMaster to the free messaging software PageNet gave him because it has scheduling features . For instance , every Monday at 11:30 a.m. the program sends the barn managers this message : " Start generators before lunch . Shut them down after lunch . " That assures Silva that the farm 's backup power supply , crucial to the 24-hour milking operation , is ready for any emergency . <p> Pagers make sense on a farm . But why do you need one if you 're already lugging around a cell phone and a laptop ? For one thing , when you 're on the road it is n't always possible to plug in your computer to download E-mail . For another , there are times when answering your cell phone is downright rude . " You never know just what you 'll be doing when your phone rings , " says Tim Scott , president and founder of Mortgage Link , in Oklahoma City . " You might be on the golf course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could cost you the deal . " Pagers vibrate quietly and then store messages . You do n't have to read or act on those messages until you 're ready . <p> What 's more , compared with cellular-phone service , paging is cheap . Leasing an alpha with one-way local paging service costs about $20 a month . For that $20 you can receive about 200 text messages , each running , on the average , about 200 characters . Compare that with the cost of 200 cell-phone calls . Even if those calls were brief  --  and local  --  they would run well over $80 , estimates Jerry Houston , a consultant and former vice-president of marketing for Socket Communications , a pager and software manufacturer in Newark , Calif . Nationwide paging coverage , by the way , costs about $50 a month . <p> Scott , who carries a pager in his pocket when he 's away from the office , founded Mortgage Link in September 1995 . The tiny , six-employee operation originates mortgage loans for home buyers . With its minimal overhead , Mortgage Link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big banks and financial institutions that are its competition . But to succeed , Scott and his colleagues must follow up every lead . Incoming calls have to be returned promptly . To make sure they are , the five loan officers , who spend much of their time in the field , depend on pagers . When home buyers call Mortgage Link for a loan or when real estate brokers contact the company to pass on referrals , office manager Shelly Garrison pages Scott or one of the loan officers from her PC , relaying a message like " New client . Call Sam Parker at 555-1212 . " <p> Mortgage Link uses Notify ! Classic , wireless messaging software from Ex Machina ( $119.95 ) , which transmits the message via modem to the loan officer . In addition to paying the one-time software cost , Mortgage Link spends $80 a month to lease the six pagers for local coverage from American Paging , a local outfit . <p> The paging industry is dominated by a handful of national players , including PageNet , PageMart , SkyTel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they all offer local , regional , and national coverage . But a large number of paging companies are small outfits furnishing local , and occasionally regional , coverage . Signing on with a local company made sense for Mortgage Link not only because Scott and his loan officers conduct virtually all their business in and around Oklahoma City , but also because local paging companies , which serve narrow territories , provide their areas with more transmitters than national companies can . The result is better service  --  a near guarantee that your page will go through . The best way to find a paging company in your area is to check the Yellow Pages under " Paging &; Signaling Equipment &; Systems . " <p> Prices do n't vary much between national and local players . When you lease an alpha and sign up for a service plan , you usually get an E-mail address for the pager ( **30;3891;TOOLONG ) . Most companies offer wireless messaging software , similar to Notify ! and PageMaster , that lets you create messages on a PC and dispatch them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also can provide software that can forward mail from your office PC 's mail programs or from your company 's local area network . The software lets you arrange to have certain E-mail messages or parts of them ( the first three lines of those from your boss , for example ) transmitted to your pager when they come in . Some companies also provide information services  --  sports scores , weather reports , stock prices , for instance  --  sometimes for an additional cost . <p> National paging companies sell through company-owned stores , resellers , and retail chains like Office Depot and Best Buy . You can call the 800 number ( see below ) or check the Yellow Pages for the company paging store nearest you . <p> Some smaller paging companies supply you with an E-mail address , but do n't assume yours will . If your provider does n't , you can enlist the services of Interpage Network Services , in West Hartford , Conn . For $10 a month or less , the company assigns an E-mail address to any pager . <p> Silva signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E-mail address when his local PageNet provider could n't , but also because it offers news and weather services . " Weather is critical in my business , " he says . " I do n't have time to sit and watch it on TV . " Throughout the day , weather reports , along with national-news updates , flash across Silva 's pager 's liquid-crystal-display ( LCD ) panel . Interpage also provides stock prices , sports scores , and even horoscopes . <p> Despite the array of PC-related services , alphanumeric paging has some limitations . Many pagers  --  or paging services  --  limit the length of a message to 240 characters . You can receive longer messages , but it can be expensive and cumbersome to do so . The text has to be broken into a series of separate message packets , each within the character limit . You may be billed for each packet separately , and the packets are likely to arrive out of order . So for practical purposes , paging is ill suited to anything but the briefest of messages . <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . To date , only SkyTel offers two-way , send-and-receive service that allows pagers to respond to PCs or Macs . ( The other national services are expected to follow suit in 1997 . ) SkyTel 's two-way paging devices have 16 predefined responses , like " On my way , " " Thank you , " " Will call later , " " Yes , " " No , " and " Where are you ? " You can also preset responses into the text of your message . The recipient chooses among the responses by aligning a small arrow on the display panel with the selected response and hitting the " send " button . <p> The need to respond on the fly got Serdar Yurdakul to trade in his one-way pager for a two-way Motorola alpha with a SkyTel 2-Way system . As vice-president of computer-telephony products for DSP Group , in Santa Clara , Calif. , he spends nearly two weeks of every month on the road , selling the company 's speech-compression chips to customers planning to embed the technology in their video phones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-the-ordinary situation , " Yurdakul says . When a customer 's order calls for unusual pricing , he zaps an E-mail from his Hewlett-Packard palmtop computer to his boss 's two-way pager : " Let me know if the below pricing is acceptable . " His boss can shoot back a reply by aligning the arrow on his pager with the response he wants to make . The national two-way service costs the company $74.95 a month . ( Local two-way coverage would cost $24.95 . ) <p> Though the advantage of two-way paging is clear , you usually ca n't create messages on a pager . However , that situation is changing . SkyTel is currently testing the SkyWriter , a two-way device that lets users write messages . The device is too small to house a keyboard , however . Instead , you " type " by moving a cursor over the letters of the alphabet , choosing the ones you want and entering them into the message text by pressing a " select " button  --  a method so cumbersome that most users are n't likely to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do n't expect technology to have an answer for everything . As Mortgage Link 's Scott puts it , " The pager sure helps , but it 's no substitute for working 12 hours a day .
