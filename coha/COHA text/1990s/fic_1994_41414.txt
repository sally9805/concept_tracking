Joanna was carried around on the shoulders of her husband because she felt she could see things better that way . It was n't because she wanted to see the ordinary things , like over fences , into cupboards , on top of shelves or through high windows . It was because being there , up , like that , gave her better insight into the extraordinary things , she said , made her feel more intuitive , philosophic , more clear headed , in general . She said it made her appreciate hundreds of things she normally would not think of , said it made clutter less noticeable , made her see a closer connection between God and life . And so she had demanded it as often as she could get away with it . Joanna 's husband had grown used to it and it had become one of those things outsiders would consider odd if they knew about it , but between a husband and wife , one of those things perfectly normal . <p> It started incidentally , the way things like that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrestling on the floor of their house , kicking table and chair legs , knocking over lamps , magazine racks , flower baskets , ending up with shoe marks all over the walls , and light plugs pulled out of sockets . Anyone who could have seen them through a window might have pounded on the door to offer help , or run somewhere to call the police , but since the nearest house was down the vast slope of lawn and beyond the tall and uncut eucalyptus trees , Joanna and her husband could have brought down the house , inside , and nobody would have known the difference . <p> It started on a day that was particularly defined , a day where the air looked as though it had been cleaned by a strainer , and all the dimness and gray and diffusing molecules had been poured over the side of the mountains like rind and pulp matter . The day looked as though it had been skimmed , and then skimmed again , so that what was left to see through was clear as water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a thin dark line , or a shimmering , disappearing line . <p> Inside the house , the sunshine came through the windows yellow , like in a child 's drawing , and branch and leaf shadows from the trees outside moved on the floor and the walls , brown and black and filamentous , in contrast to the pastel flat tones of the vases and pots and couch pillows . Joanna and Lester Douglas lay laughing and panting , appreciating the feeling of their hands on one another 's body , feeling the heartbeat and the breathing . <p> " Wus , " Joanna said . " Weakling . " <p> Lester Douglas pushed her across the floor like she was a mop , until her legs and arms were up against the kitchen partition and she looked like a spider . She laughed until she choked , upside down , and had to cough hard to breathe . " Give up ? " he said and lay himself across her as if they were in a ring and a referee would have to come and look under and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact and then count down who was on top . <p> " Uhhhhhh , " was all she said , looking across the ceiling , to where her eyes were directed , and seeing cobwebs and streaks of dried blood from swatted , dead flies . " Lift me up , " she said , after a while , straining against him . " I 'm going to get those ugly horrors right now . Lift me up , " she said , neither of them moving . " It ' s different up there , " she said , when both of them had been quiet as though sleeping , for a few moments . " It 's a completely different house . I 'd forgotten . " And she was quiet again , thinking . Lester Douglas shifted to lie by her side , putting his face into her neck and curling up in the rays of the yellow sun . " When I was little , sometimes I would hold a mirror under my eyes and look into it so that I could only see what was above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , by myself , seeing the ceiling as my floor , and it was as though I was in a different house where the walls were clean and bare and there was no furniture . The walls were white and all the doors and archways made high gateways and white forms to step over . It looked stark and sunlit and floating . It looked Arabian , like there was a garden to go out to , like I could stand against the wall by the door , and long green curtains would blow in and out of my view , and veils and robes would disappear behind white comers , and when I 'd step outside I would step into the sky and onto clouds and small airplanes flying . " Lester Douglas threw his leg over her and burrowed his face deeper into the crook of her neck as if he was looking for a well of the scent of her skin . " Lift me up , " she said . " I 've got to clean it . " Lester Douglas sat up and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ideas , and she went to get a rag and whisk broom . <p> The first thing she noticed , riding on her husband 's shoulders , was that it gave her the same feeling , that it put her in the same state of mind as looking down into the mirror , gave her what felt like a whole new dimension to be in , freed her thoughts from the usual and ordinary . Maybe it was the light that day , the purity of it , the way it made long shadows and triangular highlights inside the house . Whatever it was , it got her started on a habit . Of course she had to duck under doors and beams , and she could n't do things she normally did , but she knew immediately there was nothing much she would miss , for that time , and she also knew this would be one of the favors she asked of her husband that she would follow with a lowering of her eyelashes , a whispering of his name , her lips on the roughness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to Lester Douglas , while being carried on his shoulders , " Ask me anything , ask me about the universe , about the creation of life , about death and suffering , ask me anything , " but then she 'd realize it was just the exhilaration she was feeling of being where she was and she did n't have the answers to anything . But it felt as though she did . Sometimes it was a sensation of the height being unmeasurable , far beyond the combined feet and inches of two fairly regular sized human beings , one standing and one sitting ; it began to be a sensation of stretching and breaking through to heaven in fairy tale books ; of beanstocks or Pinochio 's nose growing , fast and dizzying and with a pop-slide sound ; like she was on one level and suddenly she was shot to another , and there would be split seconds of what she perceived was ultimate knowledge and clarification , and then nothing again , as when you rise into the air on a plane through sleet and rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a deep darkness . " Wonder what that is ? " she would say , Lester Douglas fixing a sandwich or making a cup of coffee underneath her . <p> For a while they did n't do it and Joanna felt grumpy and out of sorts and short . Everything looked to her bunched together and piled upon , their belongings like cars wrecked , like garbage heaps ; everything seemed jumbled , everywhere fingerprints and spatters and dust balls , her desk holding endless papers and debris , the laundry room multiplying into mounds of dirty sox and underwear ; and she could n't think . Could n't think for the pictures in her mind of it all ; they attached to her like devil-burrs to hair , and she carried them with her from room to room , picking up more each time she passed through the house , becoming obsessed with the details and the mess until she felt to herself like a long-furred cat who had come inside from the weed field and sat ratted up and stick laden and looking crazed . On those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was never the same as she remembered it . She could not bring forth the images , not smell the emptiness as she used to , the light and space , the chalky brightness , never imagine how far out onto the sky she could walk without falling . She thumbed through magazines of arid places , trying to re-create her frame of mind ; deserts with sand ripples like long snakes , white villages in the sun , high windows without glass , horizons crawling with heat undulations , tall towers on mountain tops , cliffs over seas ; she thought of giving things away , of clearing away everything , telephones , beds , cabinets , bookcases , couches , stamps , envelopes , letters , everything ; of lying in the center of the room with nothing to think about except small wedges of white knowledge . But it was complicated and like more devil-burrs and she went outside on the slope of the lawn and waited impatiently for Lester Douglas to come home . <p> " You are n't light , you know , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's move on to something else , " he said . " You 're pushing this one , Joanna . " <p> " You 're absolutely right , " she said , not really listening . <p> At first she could n't get him to take her outside , but she was n't able to get the idea out of her mind and convinced him to do it . It was March , and the bushes were beginning to bud new green and leaves were beginning to uncoil from the ground , flowers were starting to push up as though there were rows of underground laborers nosing at them and lifting them ; it looked to her like everything was on the tip-end verge of something , as though old things were backing away , as though any minute a silk would be raised , a light meter focused and adjusted and she wanted to be in the middle of it . " Please , " she said . " Please , please please , " she said , lifting a small foot . <p> On his shoulders , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of snail journeys and ant work , of calls and messages and signals , of patterns in the dirt and figures on rocks ; everything minute and large , high and low ; on tree trunks and blades of grass , on kites flying , and birds . She began to have a sense of long reaching thoughts that went around corners and mountains and earth curvatures , echoing back to her in wide rings and waves . She described it to her husband and he stood still , listening and watching . " Lester Douglas , " she said , " we 're not even close . We do n't have a clue . There 's something out there and it 's almost like I can stick my hand through a slot and touch it , or like it 's behind a revolving door and I have to step out and trick it to catch it . I can hear it and smell it as though it 's breathing in my face . " <p> Lester Douglas put her down onto her own two feet and climbed up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the lawn . He looked around in every direction . " It 's nothing unusual , Joanna , " he said to her . " It 's nothing but the trees and the tops of the neighbors ' houses and across to the mountains . It 's nothing unusual , " he said . " It 's spring , " he said , then . " It 's just that the air is full of flowers and pollen is being transported every-which-way and you can hear wings and such and they brush against you is all . Flutter against you , " he said . Joanna squinted up at him . " It 's just that it 's spring , " he said , jumping down . <p> Joanna took hold of his hand and they leaned on the fence , listening to dogs barking and weeds being machine-eaten alongside someone 's driveway or porch , nails being hammered , the sound repeating itself in valleys and against the mountains , someone starting up a motorcycle , the mail truck moving , stopping , and moving again along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringy and smokey looking , hardly noticeable except that the sky looked further away and like a retracted dome in an observatory , colors and sounds less than they had been . Joanna put her head on her husband 's shoulder . " What did you mean by ' flutter against you ' ? " she said , after a while . " Wings ' , " she said , " hear wings ' . Those were not your words . " <p> Lester Douglas looked at her funny . " Bees , I guess , butterflies and bees . Wasps and things . Spring things . Gnats . " He smacked at a circle of them in front of him . <p> " I know there 's no reason why you should , but did you feel different ? Did you have a certain sensation like when a radio station comes in clear ? Did anything happen ? " she asked her husband . <p> Lester Douglas closed his eyes and they rolled inside under his lids as if he was looking in his mind for what Joanna was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening them up , " just flowers in the air is all . " " Probably , " she said and glanced back at the wall , trying to imagine what the difference might be between it and her husband 's shoulders . Unsettled , she turned away . " Do n't you wish things were larger , " she said , " not so limited , " she said . " I mean , buildings reach up and up , but what does it mean , after all , how high can they get , what 's the point ? Church steeples and everything . It 's frustrating . It 's like we 're trying to look into something , catch the gist , be there in case something flies by but we 're not able . We jump up ten inches and come back down like we 're connected by a rubber band . Even with space ships we 're just bouncing around like we 're inside a bubble , " she said . " You know what I mean ? " she asked . <p> " Gravity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Joanna ? We 're only human , " he said . <p> At night she lay awake thinking about it . <p> She talked Lester Douglas into more frequent outdoor walks , his conditions being that this was ' winding down ' , that they stayed within their yard away from the front and sides of the house and that she did n't insist upon answering the gate bell if somebody rang , or did n't call out to someone passing , if someone did . These things agreed upon , they clipped high hedges , cleaned rotted leaves and webs from under patio over-hangs , checked into and repaired bird houses , changed flood lights , pulled down dead branches which swung caught from the wind , off the edge of the roof , trimmed hanging plant arrangements . They scraped high-up loose bark from the eucalyptus trees at the end of the lawn and close to the neighbors , laughing and dodging as though they were running naked or making love . All the while Joanna gathered up feelings and sensations like she was gathering bouquets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition , flashes of clear understanding , hard to see and hard to hold on to , coming just as she and Lester Douglas went over steps or around bushes , seen sometimes like sun on glass , blinding and then dull , dull and then not there , felt sometimes like curls of warm wind , pockets of cool air , changed with the turn of their bodies , of her head . " It is as slim as shale , " she said to herself . " It is stratified , and there is a layer the same as there are dinosaur layers , the same as there are dinosaurs pressed and compressed in their own age , in their own primeval garden , it is pressed and compressed , too , flat as a mural , fragile and brittle as fingernails , as filo dough . It is uneven and variegated and comes and goes . Maybe it is because of the Mexican currents or the eruptions of the volcanoes or the hole in the ozone that I can see it , that it is letting me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trouble and something is emptying ; leaking ; coming too soon , too suddenly . Maybe something has been shattered ; it is splintering off and I am catching the first reflections of it , the first rises of it . " " Everything is changing , " she said , and imagined cliffs giving away , avalanches of snow and sand , ice regions plummeting , aqua , into the sea . " I 'm afraid , " she said . <p> Lester Douglas lay down the broom he used to sweep away insect eggs and moth cocoons that clung to the corners of the porch . He bent over and ducked down so that his wife could slip from him , her dress cupping the back of his head like a monk 's hood . " Afraid of what ? " he said , holding her by the arms and looking into her eyes . <p> She pushed herself closer into him . " I do n't know , " she said . " Afraid of my thoughts , of the things I see . They 're big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joanna , " Lester Douglas said , putting the rakes and clippers and brooms into the tool closet , " do n't always be making something out of nothing . " Joanna stayed beside him , seeds blowing from far-away trees like a soft rain , falling into their hair and onto their shoulders , powdering them as though they were being seasoned . Flower petals blew across the grass behind them like tiny crowds running ; flocks of pale birds lifting up . " I do n't think we should do it anymore , " he said . " It 's disturbing you and stirring things inside you I do n't think either of us understands . I do n't think we should do it anymore , " he said . Joanna felt a blackness well up inside like he had said he did n't love her , like she had come across folded pieces of paper with another woman 's name in the corner of his billfold ; it filled out to everywhere in her not like dye in her veins but like air in a doll balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her elbows and thighs and around into the heels of her feet . Her head ached and her attention became a hard little ball , like jealousy . " Not do it ? " she said , and suddenly laughed and kissed him nose to nose , teasing him and tickling him . " Not do it ? " she said , laughing , not letting him move around her . <p> " No , really , " he said , going inside . <p> And the following days passed like that , run-of-the-mill days , every-day days , sights , sounds , colors , ordinary ; errands , groceries , shopping , taking walks , going to movies . They bicycled and bar-b-qued , cut the lawn , read the Sunday papers . They drove into the country , buying honey beside the road , terra cotta pots , oranges , nuts , rugs , shrimp , Joanna feeling claustrophobic , sometimes , ducking sometimes , by reflex , when they drove under low trees ; in the house , sometimes , wanting to push out the walls with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from looking up , sometimes ; stumbling . Sometimes she moved near to him , touched him , looked at him out of inclination and longing , half expecting him to crouch down , to let her swing herself onto him ; but she knew it was useless , knew by his refusal to let her even hint to him , by his resistance and firmness that he had made up his mind , that the subject was closed , finished . ' Do n't , ' she wanted to say . ' Let me see my way through this ' , she wanted to tell him . But she also saw that it should not go on , that it was unreasonable , that she had taken it too far . She was able now to see it as though looking through someone else 's eyes and it seemed ridiculous and peculiar and made her feel ashamed to want it so badly , made her too embarrassed to bring it up again . " But I would do it for you , " she whispered as they lay in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arms and legs , moist where their skin touched , warm within their comforter and pillows , Lester Douglas asleep and breathing noisily through his mouth , the scent of night jasmine and honey-suckle coming in through the open windows like eels , slow and tentative and reaching out to the corners of the room . Joanna turned from side to side , placing the blame for her fitfulness on having too many pillows beneath her head , on the sheets being crooked , on nightbirds and crickets ; turned from side to side as though she had n't paid the bills that week , as though she was picturing freeway accidents , as though she had leg twitches , crawling skin . <p> When Lester Douglas came home the next day , he found Joanna coming from the garage . " I could n't find a wrench , " she said . " The faucet was dripping . It stopped , " she said . He stared after her , not having been given the chance to say anything . <p> The day after that she had bruises on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to unhook a piece of T.V. cable that keeps flapping . It 's driving me crazy . I fell off the damned ladder , " she said . Lester Douglas looked at her wounds and put iodine on the scratches . " What 's with you ? " he said . " Since when do n't you wait until I get home ? What 's with you , Joanna ? " <p> " I can do it , " she said . <p> The following day the fingers on her left hand were sprained and the palm of her hand was skinned but she was able to keep it from him by not using it in front of him . A dinner she used her right hand and when some thing heavy had to be lifted , she acted like she was busy elsewhere and needed his help . He uncorked the wine , she passed the bread , he served the salad , she sliced the meatloaf . In the shower she winced washing her hair , but he was not there to hear it . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> " What ? " he said , laying down the newspaper . She looked up , surprised . <p> " Why do n't you go somewhere ? " he said , after a while , after he could see she did n't know what to say . " Maybe you need to go somewhere by yourself , Joanna . Maybe you need a change . Maybe it would make you feel better , " he said . " Why do n't you spend a couple of weeks with your sister or something ? Something 's getting to you . Maybe you need to be someplace different . Or somewhere else , Joanna . I do n't care , " he said . Europe , if you want , a real vacation . Somewhere different and exotic . Mexico , maybe , France , maybe , Portugal . " He clicked his fingers to sound like castanets , but she was getting up from the couch as if to cut him off . <p> " I do n't know what to do , Joanna , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portugal , " she said , not in the least interested , and as a matter of fact annoyed that he was missing the point completely , although not being able to see her face and the expression on it , he might have thought she was considering the idea . She shook her head , slightly , to herself . " Portugal , " she said again , and walked away . <p> She had n't wanted to actually go . She certainly had n't meant not to come back . If Lester Douglas had been home she would have called to him , in the beginning , would have told him that she was able to do it , that by finding the right place and by adjusting her position time and again , she was able to do it ; would have called out to him , when she had the chance , to come up , that he had n't given it time , that it was something to witness , something he should n't miss , that she had n't been making some thing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she had been there , finally , up on the roof , fine tuning it , so to speak , taking in what she could , high and low , soft and loud , far and wide , listening , watching , experiencing , even though she felt anxious , even though she felt very worried ; had been there , adjusting and re-adjusting , when it was as if , and here is where she would have had the most trouble , if any of this were possible to tell him at all , as near as she would have been able to describe it , if she could have described it , suddenly a train or a bus had come along , or a ride in a beautiful driverless car when she might have been sitting on a hot bench in the middle of nowhere , waiting . She would have told him it was like that , like when you are thirsty and fidgety and impatient and minutes seem like days and what you are waiting for , although you do n't know it , appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imagined it into being , and that it was like not being able to make up your mind in a situation like that , where you are half in and half out , one leg up and one leg down and wondering about the consequences at the same time you are visualizing all the places you 'll go , like out West or over the Canadian border or into Central and South America . She would have told him how she stood there with her shirt blowing like in the movies when you can see the heat from the ground and feel the wind , stood there looking out over the lawn and the other roof tops and down to the trees , looked out over the mailman stopping down the road , neighbors walking inside their houses , workmen working , not really seeing any of it , not hearing any of it . Would have told him , if she had any way to , before any move was made one way or the other , before anything was really ever decided , if that would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world , that there was an invitation , some kind of attitude , like ' make up your mind ' , or ' this is it that 's all she wrote ' , or ' take it or leave it ' , almost like daring her , teasing her ; how it had seemed , it being she would n't have been able to explain what , possessive of her , admiring of her , having prior knowledge of her ; how when she had even considered thinking of moving forward , even felt the curiosity of moving forward , had let the thought barely run through her mind about what he , Lester Douglas , had said about something different and exotic , some kind of change , somewhere by herself , how she had felt herself immediately , dizzyingly edging into something , sliding side-ways and up into something narrow , some-thing and narrow and split-apart seeming , sliding into it the same way as you would slide into theatre seats when the curtain has gone up , she would have chosen to describe to her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; sliding in , holding in your breath and turning out your feet the way you do so that you do n't bother anyone . She would have told him , if she knew how , if there had been any way she could have , that once she had gone past that here was simply no turning back , no changing her mind , period , nothing she could do , nothing ; that there was one last move , one last step which had felt spread-out and rubbery . Spongy . Giving . And endless . Then vast , vast beyond vast . Huge . Immense . Mega-immense . Boundless . Illimitable . Dinotherian . Splendorous . That there was one last sensation she had of all things at once . All things at once . And at that point , or time , or at that point in time , or whatever it was , whatever it was supposed to be , if she had tried in every way she knew how , or had known how , she could n't have said anything anymore , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what she normally knew anymore , or she was n't conscious of knowing it , or she did n't know it in the same way as she used to know it , or she was it . She could n't tell . If she had been able to slip some kind of message to him , quickly , throw out a note to have it fall by the door so that he could see it when he got home , or if she had thought ahead and left it for him on the table or the counter , having even the remotest idea she might end up going somewhere , like he said she ought to , after all , she would have said it in this manner , knowing , because she would still have been capable of knowing things in some kind of a familiar way then , knowing that he would probably not be that surprised : " Lester Douglas , " she would have written , if she had not yet gone past a particular point , " Please try to understand , " she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she could have , " I tried to tell you , " she could have added , if it was at all possible to convey any form of message to him , " Lester Douglas , " she would have written , " Do n't be mad , " she may have told him . " I could n't stop myself , " she might have explained . " I had to have it , " she could have said . <p>
