To read the volumes of outraged male commentary , you 'd think Lorena Bobbitt had got her training in a feminist guerrilla camp and her carving skills from the SCUM ( Society for Cutting Up Men ) Manifesto . " Go out into the world , " her trainers must have told her , " find some sexist lowlife , preferably an ex- Marine named John Wayne , and , you know , cut it off ! " <P> But Lorena Bobbitt is in many ways just your typical small-town multicultural manicurist , a woman whose ideas of political science are summed up in a statement she made about Venezuela , where she grew up : " I have a patriotism . . . We do have McDonald 's . We do have Pizza Hut . " Nor are the women who harassed Dr. James Sehn 's wife in a McLean , Virginia , beauty parlor because he had helped reattach the offending organ known to be commandos from the National Organization for Women . In fact , the really interesting thing about the Bobbitt affair is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one hand , and your average office wit or female cafeteria orator , on the other . <P> While the gals in data entry are discussing fascinating new possibilities for cutlery commercials , the feminist pundits are tripping over one another to show that none of them is , goddess forbid , a " man hater . " And while the pundits are making obvious but prissy-sounding statements like " The fact that one has been a victim does n't give one carte blanche to victimize others , " the woman in the street is making V signs by raising two fingers and bringing them together with a snipping motion . <P> If the feminist intellectuals seem slightly out of touch , it 's because they 're preoccupied these days with their own factional matters , such as the great standoff over the subject of victimhood . On the pro-victimhood side are the legions of domestic-abuse specialists who see Lorena Bobbitt as one more martyr in women 's long , weepy history of rape and abuse . On the anti side are feminist authors like Naomi Wolf and Wendy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from feminism because they 're sick and tired of hearing about victims and " victimology " : foot binding , battering , genital mutilation , witch burnings and the like . Time to stop whining , the anti- victimhood feminists say , and go for the power . <P> Both sides make valid points . It 's just that neither seems to grasp the brazen new mood out there represented by , among other things , all the grass- roots female backing for Ms. Bobbitt . The retail clerks who send her letters of support , the homemakers who cackle wildly every time they sharpen the butcher knife are neither " tired of hearing about victims " nor eager to honor them . They 're tired of being victims . And they 're eager to see women fight back by whatever means necessary . Probably it all started when Louise  --  or was it Thelma ?  --  dispatched that scumball would-be rapist in the parking lot of a bar . In fact , we ca n't get enough of warrior-woman flicks : Sigourney Weaver in Alien , Linda Hamilton in Terminator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies who would n't slice anything off , one suspected , unless they meant to put it straight into a Cuisinart.
