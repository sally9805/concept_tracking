SHOW : AND THE BAND PLAYED ON <P> TIME : SEPT. 11 , 8 P.M. EDT ( DEBUT ) , HBO <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Randy Shilts ' AIDS chronicle becomes a dramatically coherent but oversimplified TV movie . <P> And the Band Played On arrives on television trailing storm clouds of controversy . Randy Shilts ' 1987 book about the early years of the AIDS crisis was first acquired by NBC , which later dropped the project . HBO picked it up but had trouble finding stars willing to appear in it until Richard Gere led a parade of big names who signed on  --  among them Steve Martin , Anjelica Huston , Lily Tomlin , Phil Collins , Ian McKellen and Matthew Modine . Later , director Roger Spottiswoode clashed with HBO over changes made without his approval to tone down the film 's portrayal of gays in the promiscuous pre-AIDS era . Added to this was the provocative subject matter : Shilts ' harsh critique of the U.S. government and the medical establishment for their slow response to the AIDS crisis . <P> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproar has settled into a generally respectful buzz . Shilts ' prodigiously researched 600-page book has been boiled down to a fact-filled , dramatically coherent , occasionally moving 2 hours and 20 minutes . At a time when most made-for-TV movies have gone tabloid crazy , here is a rare one that tackles a big subject , raises the right issues , fights the good fight . That is both its strength and its weakness . <P> Screenwriter Arnold Schulman has skillfully pared down Shilts ' sprawling narrative , which covers just about everything from the medical detective story to the fight for government attention and funding , from the gay community 's reaction to the health crisis to the media 's inadequate early coverage of it . The film has a hero : Modine plays Don Francis , a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control who was at the forefront of early work on the disease . He voices most of Shilts ' anti-Establishment outrage and gets most of the best lines . " How many people have to die to make it cost-efficient for you people to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the nation 's blood banks resist testing blood for AIDS , despite early evidence that the disease is being spread by transfusions . <P> And there 's a juicy villain : Dr. Robert Gallo , the National Cancer Institute researcher who raced furiously against the French to be the first to identify the AIDS virus . As portrayed by Alan Alda , Gallo is a self-glorifying skunk who dreams up publicity releases for himself before he has anything to publicize . " From this day , " he muses to an aide after a good day in the lab , " Dr. Robert Gallo makes the first gigantic strides in winning the  --  what , the war or the battle ? . . . " The characterization is overdone , but the picture of the competitive underside of medical research operations rings true .
