The floods and mud slides that have devastated Venezuela  --  and that may have killed as many as 30,000 people  --  were an all too foreseeable tragedy . Millions of people inhabit Caracas ' ranchos , the squalid shantytowns that cling to both sides of the 6,000-ft. mountains ringing the capital . And for decades those people have fought a Sisyphean battle to keep their rickety tin , cardboard and clay-block houses from tumbling down the washed-out slopes during heavy rains . Hundreds have died in past downpours , but as los ranchos kept swelling in size and population , it was only a matter of time before a deluge claimed thousands of lives . <P> Last week that deluge came  --  and it wrought what may have been Latin America 's deadliest natural disaster of the 1900s , a grim closing note to the continent 's century . Fewer than 2,000 bodies had been recovered as of late last week , and a reliable death toll was impossible to calculate as soldiers and rescue workers continued digging near the northern coastal town of La Guaira , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toll would certainly surpass 5,000 and could even reach 30,000 . " There are bodies in the sea , under mud , everywhere , " said President Hugo Chavez , as corpses filled the tarmac at nearby Simon Bolivar Airport . " It 's horrible . " How horrible was evident in the spectral gaze of Alegra Rangel , who had seen her four small children buried alive , inside the family 's car , by a roaring mud slide . " I got out for a moment to see what the noise was , " she said , still in shock , " and when I looked back they were gone . " <P> The five days of relentless Caribbean storms left more than 150,000 people homeless amid billions of dollars in damage . Huge swaths of the northern coast , where Venezuela 's chief ports and tourist resorts lie , are now uninhabitable . The devastation was doubly crushing because Venezuela is suffering one of its worst recessions ever . Decades of foul politics played just as large a role in this catastrophe as the week of foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is America 's No. 1 foreign source of crude . But because a corrupt elite , los cogollos ( slang for big shots ) , has pillaged the country 's oil wealth for generations , 80% of Venezuela 's people live in poverty  --  and each year , searching for jobs , they scratch their way onto Caracas ' perilous mountainside real estate . In those vertical , collapsible slums , potable water is a luxury , and violent crime is among the worst in South America . " We live in a constant state of emergency , " said one rancho community leader . <P> That is largely why Venezuelans last year elected the populist , corruption-busting Chavez . A former army paratrooper colonel , he led a bloody but failed coup attempt in 1992 that was widely applauded by citizens fed up with cogollo rule . Many citizens complained that Chavez 's government was initially slow to respond to the disaster . They conceded , however , that he was doing more than his effete predecessors would probably have done  --  dispatching troops to set up relocation camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Dec. 15 , the day the flooding began , voters approved his new federal constitution , which is intended to make Venezuela a more equitable democracy .
