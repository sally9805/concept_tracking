Last month , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled that no cameras will be allowed in his courtroom when the O.J. Simpson wrongful-death lawsuit commences this week . Not only that , but the attorneys in this civil case  --  unlike their loose-lipped counterparts who starred in the criminal proceedings  --  have been muzzled by a strict gag order . Courtroom sketch artists will be permitted to ply their trade , sort of : they may not draw during the proceedings and so must produce their sketches from memory after leaving court each day . And Fujisaki , who has a reputation for take-no-prisoners briskness , will not read any motions from the attorneys that are more than five pages long . " History will repeat itself , " Fujisaki noted in a written order , " unless the court acts to prevent it . " <P> Still , despite the judge 's best efforts , much about the Sequel of the Century will seem like deja vu . John Q. Kelly and Daniel M. Petrocelli , lead lawyers for the families of murder victims Nicole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.J. Simpson liable for the deaths , expect to admit some 2,000 pieces of evidence , including the bloody glove . Nearly 350 witnesses will be called , including Kato Kaelin and Mark Fuhrman , though the judge has ruled that Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden will not testify . Both sides estimate that it will take at least four months to try the case . Then again , Simpson I was expected to last only six months , not the nine months it ultimately devoured . <P> Thanks to the criminal trial and its endless postmortems , the attorneys can already identify some of the potential land mines in the case and have been filing motions to defuse them . The plaintiffs ' lawyers want to exclude all testimony regarding possible evidence tampering and racist cops . Simpson 's attorney , Robert C. Baker , has moved to exclude anything pertaining to violence between Nicole and O.J. Both motions are likely to fail , and a controversial new California law , which permits statements of crime victims to be admitted in court , will open the door to a dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson 's beating her . Those entries were excluded as hearsay during the criminal proceedings . <P> What no one can adequately prepare for is the trial 's main event : the testimony of Simpson himself , who under civil rules is obliged to take the stand . The former football star has undergone a grueling nine days of depositions , enduring 248 questions in a row about how he cut his hand in his Chicago hotel room the night of the murders . Though Simpson made no obvious missteps , he was not a model witness . At one point during pretrial depositions , Simpson ignored several of Baker 's admonishments to be quiet . Finally Baker , a veteran civil lawyer who specializes in medical-malpractice defense , shouted , " What am I , a potted plant ? " <P> Other new faces on the witness stand will include Nicole 's friend Faye Resnick , who wrote a book about the tempestuous relationship between Simpson and Nicole and whose testimony is expected to open the door to further mutual character assassination and details of the couple 's party-hearty life-styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she broke up with Simpson the morning of June 12 , 1994 , perhaps providing the spark for an explosion of rage that night .
