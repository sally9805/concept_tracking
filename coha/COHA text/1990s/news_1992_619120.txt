<p> ONCE AGAIN , Richard Wagner appears in the defendant 's box to face the old familiar charges . He stands accused on two pretty serious counts : of being a virulent anti-Semite  --  and indeed an all-around disagreeable person  --  and of being an accessory before the fact to the crimes of Hitler and the Third Reich . <p> The occasion for the current hearing is the controversy that has arisen in Israel over music director Daniel Barenboim 's attempts last month to include a program of Wagner 's music in the Israel Philharmonic 's regular subscription series . That concert , which was postponed indefinitely after protests by musicians and subscribers , would have been the first regularly scheduled performance of Wagner 's music in the land since 1938 , when Arturo Toscanini led what was then the Palestine Symphony in a Wagner program ( in 1981 , Zubin Mehta sprang a surprise Wagner encore on a shocked audience ) . <p> Does Wagner merit such anathema ? In one sense , it 's odd that these charges keep coming up in slightly different guises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily rendered . <p> To the first charge , the evidence will allow no conclusion but " guilty . " In his own writings , particularly the notorious essay " Jewishness in Music , " published pseudonymously in 1850 , and more extensively in the diaries of his wife , Cosima , Wagner 's hateful attitudes toward Jews are abundantly evident . <p> It 's true that there are some intriguing shades of gray to be worked into this portrait , and some potential mitigating circumstances to be introduced  --  close relations with individual Jews ( why , some of his best friends . . . ) , prevailing social mores and so on . But none of these are sufficient to alter the overall merits of the charge . <p> Conversely , it takes no genius in chronology to realize that Wagner had been six years in the grave by the time Hitler was even born , and that the crimes of Nazi Germany can hardly be laid to his account . Again , one may be able to trace the latent seeds of Nazi mythology here and there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found . <p> Still , if the verdicts themselves are easy to determine , their implications may not be so clear-cut . Last Sunday 's New York Times offered a minisymposium on Wagner and Israel , asking 13 interested parties for their views on the matter . Some of the opinions offered were thoughtful , and some impressively boneheaded . But the range of disagreement was broad , perhaps surprisingly so . <p> What seemed clear after reading these differing views was that many of the difficulties arise from posing the question in the wrong way . Whether Wagner 's music is inherently fascist  --  and , if so , what that would mean about its aesthetic worth  --  is a fascinating question for musicians , philosophers and critics to ponder , but it does n't amount to a criterion for concert programming . Similarly , the moral stature of Wagner the man is , properly speaking , a red herring . <p> What 's at issue is simply the music 's history as an emblem of the Third Reich  --  and the associations that that emblem conveys to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the Israel Philharmonic to refrain from invoking this symbol is neither to lapse into censorship nor to falsify history , as some reckless souls have charged . It is simply to acknowledge the nature of the society in which the orchestra is situated . It is to recognize that this nation is home to thousands of Holocaust survivors , for whom Wagner 's music , whatever its artistic merits , signifies brutal terror and mass murder . <p> Who has the right to tell those people to stop being so darned sensitive ? Not Daniel Barenboim . <p> And as for the down side of avoiding Wagner 's music  --  well , there is n't any . It 's ludicrous to pretend that without this handful of pieces , the musical life of an entire country will waste away , leaving it an artistic backwater . No single composer  --  not even Wagner  --  is that indispensable . <p> Yet all of this is true only so long as it is the symbolic force of Wagner 's work  --  its status as a kind of musical swastika  --  and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the motivating force . In other words , it is not Wagner on trial after all . It is Hitler . <p> What muddies the terms of the debate , though , is the perennial fascination that a figure such as Wagner holds for us . For Wagner was both a bad man and a great artist , and no matter how often that combination recurs in history , it never becomes any less surprising or stops seeming like an insoluble contradiction . <p> The inevitable human response , when faced with any such contradiction , is to try to bring the parts into closer alignment  --  typically , by either whitewashing the biography or denigrating the work . Examples of both strategies abound in the case of Wagner , where so much discussion of his music has taken place within the framework of his forceful personality . <p> Similar moral conflicts can be found in other instances . In an article last year , for example , Richard Taruskin of the UC Berkeley music department made the startling assertion that Prokofiev 's musical output was due for reappraisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stalinist regime . Nor is such second-guessing restricted to music : Many women felt that it would be difficult to see Picasso 's paintings the same way after biographers detailed the artist 's appalling treatment of women throughout his life . <p> Enemies of deconstructionist literary criticism seized with glee on the posthumous revelations that Paul de Man , the school 's chief proponent in this country , had written hundreds of pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic articles as a young journalist in wartime Europe  --  as though the personal rectitude of the practitioner correlated to the value of the theory . A wonderfully absurd extreme of this kind of thinking is the story ( possibly apocryphal ) of the academic philosopher who , on hearing that a prominent rival had been charged with murdering his wife , muttered , " I always said his ideas were rubbish . " <p> The issue was raised again , in a limited way , by something that happened just last November , during the tense Louisiana gubernatorial race . The Chronicle ran an article about the handful of Bay Area residents who had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small shudder went through some segments of the musical community here at the revelation that one of those contributors was a minor but locally well-known San Francisco composer . <p> The question is , what does it tell you about a body of music to learn that its creator harbors warm thoughts about the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party ? The answer , I think , is probably not much . As a critic , I can say that I am unlikely to hear this man 's music again with an open mind . But my animus toward him is personal and entirely extramusical ; his work itself is no better or worse than it was before . <p> How much easier for all concerned if such people could be counted on to write only bad music ! Wagner upsets any such simplistic fantasies , and this is why the reasons for not playing his music matter so much . <p> TO avoid the music out of deference to the sensibilities of a generation of Holocaust survivors makes no aesthetic claims about the music itself . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this particular time and place . <p> But to deny the music 's power and importance simply because its creator was an anti-Semite is no more defensible than the Nazis ' attempts to denigrate Mendelssohn 's music because he was born a Jew . In neither case can the aesthetic truth be subjected for too long to an extramusical agenda . <p> With time , the close association between the Third Reich and Wagner 's music will weaken ; the symbolism will become less immediate and , for most , less charged . But Wagner is going to remain a wicked man and a great composer forever .
