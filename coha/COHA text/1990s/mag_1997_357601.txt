Those close to Steve Forbes know only this about his spiritual life : he 's an Episcopalian and attends St. John on the Mountain in Bernardsville , N.J. Perhaps you 'd be circumspect about your faith too if your father had made you wear a kilt to Sunday services as a kid . " He had n't given an awful lot of thought to these kinds of issues until he started running for President last year , " says Forbes supporter Gordon Humphrey . Nor had Forbes spent much time communing with the more demonstrative branches of Protestantism . " As an Episcopalian , he never rubbed shoulders too much with Baptists and those who fall into the category of religious conservatives . " <P> But as Forbes tries a second time for the Republican Party 's presidential nomination , he is rubbing a lot of those shoulders . After he settled into a black Chevrolet Suburban last June for a drive with the Rev. Louis Sheldon , the ultraconservative founder of the Traditional Values Coalition , Forbes endured an hour-long grilling . The preacher asked for Forbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for ) , and the " homosexual-rights agenda " ( against , but no harassment , please ) . " I was a doubter , " says Sheldon . " The stereotype from the 1996 campaign was that Steve Forbes was clearly pro-choice and clearly libertarian . " Sheldon emerged a believer . " By the time we got there , " he recalls , " we were chatting away like two old cousins . " <P> Since withdrawing from the presidential race 19 months ago , Forbes has been attempting to sell himself as a social conservative to religious leaders like Sheldon . That 's no mean feat for a patrician publisher , but there are signs that the crusade is working . So adroitly hasForbes courted the religious right since last year 's election that G.O.P. elders who once treated him as an amusing sideshow now talk of him as a comer to watch in the early stages of the 2000 campaign . " No one is laughing now , " says Republican Congressman Bill Paxon . <P> Forbes ' wooing of religious conservatives is , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After an early spurt in last year 's Republican primaries , Forbes was forced out of the race in part because he was indifferent to the party 's powerful Christian Coalition wing . At one point , remembered by campaign chairman Malcolm Wallop as " that big catastrophe in Iowa , " Forbes took off after the organization for falsely painting him as pro-abortion rights . " The Christian Coalition does not speak for most Christians , " he said . <P> To avoid such costly confrontations , Forbes is recasting himself more to the Christian Coalition 's liking while insisting he is not undergoing a makeover . " This is where Steve has always been , " says Bill Dal Col , former campaign manager and president of the Forbes think tank . Forbes ' pastor at St. John on the Mountain says Forbes has a track record of talking thoughtfully about religious subjects in the confines of his own church . In May 1994 " he gave really a remarkable speech on the subject of religion , ethics and spirituality on the one hand and corporate life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al Niese . " It was wonderfully witty initially and then marvelously deep and thoughtful . He really seemed to be comfortable with his voice here . "
