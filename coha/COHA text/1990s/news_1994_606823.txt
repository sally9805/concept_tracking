<p> Thanksgiving Day did not find Andrew Grove , chief executive of Intel Corp . of Santa Clara , Calif. , feeling very thankful . <p> A technical glitch in the company 's prized product , the Pentium processor , was threatening to become a public storm . On the previous Tuesday , CNN had broadcast a report that the chip could do its arithmetic wrong . Reporters from national newspapers were calling . The company had faced vexing technical problems before  --  but never , in Grove 's 25 years in the industry , the ire of disgruntled consumers . <p> Instead of sitting down to turkey , Intel 's senior management team spent that day gathered around a conference table , trading ideas on how the company , the world 's largest producer of computer chips , should respond to what most could not believe was a serious problem . <p> In the following weeks it mushroomed into a classic crisis of corporate image , rivaling ones faced by Johnson &; Johnson over poisoned Tylenol , Perrier over contaminated water and Audi over cars that allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front page of the country 's leading newspapers . TV comedians joked about it . Intel 's stock faltered . <p> The crisis and Intel 's response illustrate how the same events look radically different inside and outside a company . Throughout , Intel has clung to its position that Pentium has a small technical problem of concern to only a few scientific users . But to many consumers , their faith in Intel and the computers they spent thousand of dollars to buy has been severely shaken . <p> In the industry , many companies agree with Intel that the technical problems are not severe . But the consensus view is that " Intel handled it badly , " said Phil Lemmons , editor in chief of PC Week , a leading industry publication . <p> In a telephone conference call with analysts last Monday , Grove said that he believed the company had taken the right steps . " We are anxious to have this event behind us , " he told analysts . But noting that the issue had exploded into a public relations episode , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do about that . " <p> In the past , technical companies have relied on their customers ' patience and understanding when flubs showed up in new products . Intel engineers point out that every generation of microprocessor typically goes through half a dozen " steppings , " or redesigns , to fix problems . <p> When Grove and his team gathered on Thanksgiving they began to realize that this time , a broader range of customers was concerned , spanning those who run complex math to those who play games . <p> Intel 's response to all still was rooted firmly in technology : It wanted to explain the problem . " Our attempt was to communicate to each of these levels of constituencies at a level appropriate to their technical understanding , " said Dennis Carter , Intel vice president of corporate marketing . <p> On the Sunday after Thanksgiving , an apology and explanation written by Grove went out via the Internet electronic network to the group of consumers who , at least initially , seemed the most aggrieved  --  technologists sending anxious notes to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues and dispatched them to the company 's major information-technology accounts . <p> Intel relied on its press staff , talking to the reporters , to carry its message to the general public . And it established a toll-free " 800 " phone number that people could call to talk to technical specialists about the issues . <p> Yet though technical explanations often work for those who traffic in technology , about half of the estimated 4 million Pentium-based computers sold so far were bought by consumers who have little time or patience for such mathematical subtleties as " floating point divides " and " significant digits . " <p> " You 're playing to the hearts and minds of consumers , " said Kathryn Rudi Harrigan , a professor at Columbia University Business School . " Their attitude is : ' Do n't tell me about the details . I want it to work , and I do n't want a hassle . ' " <p> Explaining technical details to angry consumers did not help Audi in the mid-1980s when it was barraged by reports that its Audi 5000 car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems were not in the car but in how it was driven by Americans . A U.S. government report later confirmed those conclusions . But Audi customers thought the company did not treat their concerns with respect . Since then , Audi 's U.S. sales have plummeted by the tens of thousands . <p> " Companies need to suggest a sincerity , a feeling that ' we care about what 's going to happen , ' " said Susanne Roschwalb , an associate professor of communications at American University . <p> That was precisely the tack taken by AT &T; Corp . in mid-January 1991 , when a software failure paralyzed its long-distance network . After the company worked through the night to patch the problem , AT &T; Chairman Bob Allen held a news conference the next day . <p> " Bob was asked who made the error , " recalled Marilyn Laurie , an AT &T; vice president for communications , " and he said , ' As far as our customers are concerned , I did . ' " At the same time , AT &T; announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of an apology . <p> " If you 're a company that provides a vital service to millions of people , known for your credibility , ethics and a reputation based on service , you can have only one attitude toward a crisis , " Laurie concluded . " Get your facts out . Tell the truth , and tell it fast . " <p> At Intel , Grove has given no press conferences on the Pentium problem . The closest thing he has made to a public appearance was a conference telephone call with Wall Street stock analysts , on the day that International Business Machines Corp . executives said they would not sell computers with the flawed chips because IBM studies indicated that Pentium may miscalculate more frequently than Intel claimed . <p> IBM 's move caused Intel 's stock to plummet so fast that trading was temporarily halted . <p> What the company has not done is to promise to replace any chip , no questions asked , with a corrected one . Instead , Intel has a qualified replacement policy that pledges to replace chips " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Carter said . <p> That policy has probably saved Intel money by holding down the number of replacements  --  the chips can cost nearly $ 1,000 each . But how it will affect Intel 's reputation in the long term " depends entirely how quickly the alternative vendors can move , " Columbia 's Harrigan said . " If I were a really nasty competitor of Intel 's , I 'd play up the differences between my chip and theirs . " <p> One company , NextGen , already makes small numbers of Pentium chip clones . And in the second half of 1995 , both Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Cyrix Corp. , with the assistance of IBM , are expected to have their versions ready . IBM is promoting its Power PC chip as an alternative and intends to launch a new line of machines using the chip next year . <p> AT &T's; Laurie offered one other observation : " Unless a problem explodes under you , it tends to look more containable than it is . " But companies soon learn , she added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Intel is learning that lesson painfully . In addition to its image problems , it is facing a class-action suit from a handful of law firms asserting that Intel deceived consumers by not disclosing the flaw last summer , when in-house testing detected it . <p> The episode has left the rest of the technical community jittery . " Our main feeling is ... there but for the grace of God go we , " said Roy Verley , director of corporate communications at Hewlett-Packard Co . " It could happen to any high-tech company . None of us is prepared as we need to be . " <p> In the meantime , Intel 's staff is still losing its holidays . While managers sacrificed Thanksgiving Day to the Pentium bug , the company 's production crews will lose Christmas . Although most chip manufacturing plants take a break at the end of the year , Intel 's are running 24-hour-a-day shifts through the holidays to produce chips that do n't have the flaw . <p> " At the moment , we 're working very long hours to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the analysts . " You may fault us for being a technological company , " he added . " I believe it 's a strength .
