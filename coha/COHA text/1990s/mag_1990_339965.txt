CINEMA PARADISO Directed and Written by Giuseppe Tornatore <P> Alone in the theater , Father Adelfio ( Leopoldo Trieste ) , the little Sicilian town 's ex officio movie censor , rings a bell whenever anything on the screen strikes him as salacious . Up in the booth , Alfredo , the projectionist ( Philippe Noiret , who is becoming Spencer Tracy to our age ) , slaps a piece of paper into the reel marking the spot the priest has X-rated . The walls of Alfredo 's aerie are festooned with ribbons of film he has cut from movies before showing them to the public , for the good father sees in even the most chaste movie kiss an occasion for sin . <P> Secretly watching these censorious rites , though not entirely comprehending them , is a little boy named Toto ( played by a delightful discovery , Salvatore Cascio ) . For him , any moving image is the nearest available occasion for bliss . An indifferent altar boy to the priest , he is a passionate acolyte to the projectionist , who is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his machine ) , the cranky guardian of a mystery more awesome  --  or at least more attractive  --  to the child than anything the church has to offer . <P> In this alternative religion , Toto will rise from novice ( as the projectionist 's assistant ) to parish priest ( he takes over when Alfredo is blinded in a nitrate-film fire ) to bishop ( he becomes a director ) . But it is one of the many graces of Cinema Paradiso that it is content merely to observe the analogies between two faiths , not point up the conflict between them . Writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore 's manner is gently reflective , not satirical . His largest aim , and greatest success , is to re-create the lost spirit of a vanished movie era : the late 1940s and early ' 50s . <P> In that period , before television converted moving images into visual tranquilizers  --  pain and time killers sold over the airwaves without prescription ( or proscription )  --  they were stimulants to heroic-romantic imaginings . Self-transcendence , if you will . The movies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensibilities of provincial youngsters . Sneaking out from under parental disapproval , sheltering in the dark under the big , glowing screen , innocently absorbing its fantastic representations of faraway realities , surrendering to the belief that those realities must be true ( unendurable to think that the whole world was as constricted as one little corner of Sicily was ) , Toto comes close to becoming a generational archetype , transcending the particulars of his own situation . <P> But if he is seen with a certain sentiment , he is seen with a certain bracing irony too . When he achieves adolescence ( and is played at this stage of his life by the appealing Marco Leonardi ) , he conducts his first and , as it turns out , only great love affair with the remote Elena ( Agnese Nano ) as if it were an old-fashioned movie romance , something like one of those doomy weepers Garbo used to do . Poor Toto . In this realm he has only screen conventions to guide him .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
