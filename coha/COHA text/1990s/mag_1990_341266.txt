At first , as Frank Sinatra used to sing , they had high hopes  --  pie-in-the- sky hopes . After 40 years as the poor relatives , the East Germans were going to be welcomed into the big house . Following decades of yearning for the good life , as they had seen it nightly on West German television , 16 million East Germans would be inside the supermarket with real money in their pockets . In the country 's first-ever free election last March , people acted not only on the principle of one man , one vote , but also for one mark , one mark . Last Sunday , when monetary union between the two parts of the country took effect , they began to collect . <P> The shopping spree had actually started months earlier . East Germans moved beyond the oranges and bananas , so popular when the Wall first came down , to consumer electronics and cars . Everywhere , new brand names began to beckon : Panasonic , Miele , Zanussi . Magdeburg became Marlboro country . The West German chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stocked it with Western goods . East Berlin got its Benetton . <P> Yet with DM-day come and gone , the mood is uneasy . While West Germans fret over the blank check they have signed , East Germans fear that before they enter the earthly paradise , they may have to pass through a purgatory of inflation and unemployment . They are also concerned that they may prove to be easy pickings for predatory Westerners , or Wessis in G.D.R . parlance . Certainly , the Wessis are coming . Hotels are packed with Western businessmen eager to cut deals , whether the object of desire is a state-owned company , retail floor space , or a summer home on the Baltic . <P> Inflation worries arise because state subsidies in the G.D.R . kept many prices artificially low . Rent and the costs of basic foods and public transport typically were a fraction of those in West Germany  --  less than one- fifteenth in the case of rent . On the other hand , consumer durables were outrageously overpriced  --  and an open market will bring them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West German wage , and the 1-to- 1 money conversion , the key part of the economic-union agreement , does nothing to alter that . In part , this is rough justice . Productivity in the G.D.R . is perhaps only a third of West Germany 's , so employers will be paying less but also will be getting less . <P> For nearly a half-century , East German workers have held lifetime jobs in companies that had only to meet production goals , without much concern for costs , quality or innovation . The madness in this method is symbolized by the Trabant , the plastic-enclosed , four-wheel motorcycle posing as a small car . Until last November , customers waited up to 15 years for the privilege of buying one for then 22,000 ostmarks , or about $4,000 ; currently , the Trabant can not be sold at any price .
