Section : THE NATION 'S PULSE <p> For a century and a half the politician and the camera have been involved in a power struggle , changes in technology shifting the advantage between one side and the other . In the beginning , like anyone else who posed for Mathew Brady or Alexander Gardner , statesmen had to stand still and , even less characteristically , shut up for a moment or two . Early presidential facial expressions run to impatience and bafflement , as their wearers struggle not to move : Martin Van Buren leans on a book and John Quincy Adams folds his hands , to steady them , one suspects , in his lap . General Grant actually stands with his head clamped between the tines of what looks like a giant tuning fork . Lincoln , unsurprisingly , manages to defy convention even as he honors it . Photographed by Gardner in the last months of his life , he adopts the conventional three-quarters profile staring into space , but his lips portray amusement over his son , Tad , standing a foot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera 's increasing speed and portability allowed the politician to force it away from portraiture and into witnessing the historical moment . But even in 1862 , Gardner was shooting Lincoln and McClellan in a tent at Antietam , the two subjects looking animated and intense , a map or newspaper ( it 's difficult to tell ) discarded at the President 's feet , and a Confederate flag folded up on the dry ground . Soon the camera could even travel along with a politician on the mere chance that something might happen . In 1910 , William Warnecke succeeded in capturing New York Mayor William J. Gaynor an instant after he had been shot ; the blood pours down from his head and a young man rushes wide-eyed to his aid . <p> The curators of " American Politicians : Photographs from 1843 to 1993 , " 1 which runs at New York 's Museum of Modern Art through January 3 , have tried to keep a balance between general historical significance and important developments in this particular genre of picture-taking . A viewer will find little of Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of these titans , and a surprising amount of William McKinley , a dull-looking man whose photographers did an interesting job ( in the days before zoom lenses ) of capturing the crowds around him . <p> Probably the best political photographs come out of election campaigns , when the candidates are desperate with self-importance and the voters are jazzed by courtship . Riding through Elwood , Indiana , in August 1940 , Wendell Willkie  --  surrounded by roaring faithful tipping their hats , and police motorcycles churning up dust  --  seems so mad with excitement that he ca n't have noticed how he 's just ridden past the undertaker 's parlor . Six years later , Congressman Joseph Martin is photographed through the office window of the Massachusetts paper he published , as he listens to election returns over the telephone . So stunned does Martin seem ( he 's on his way to becoming Speaker of the House ) , and so in character everyone else around him , that a viewer wonders just how spontaneous Allan Grant 's picture really was . A Life photo of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his own poster , which looks as if it 's been designed to tout a film instead of a candidacy . <p> When dealing with politicians , art photography is generally about as appealing as state-sponsored painting . Edward Steichen 's Theodore Roosevelt , from 1908 , is gauzily heroic , and the 1955 Nixon that Philippe Halsman caught for his pointless " jumping " series does have a certain vice-presidential irony to it ( as well as the additional merit of giving an aerodynamic lift to Nixon 's jowls ) , but politicians are best captured when they are trying to manipulate people instead of permitting photographers to manipulate them . In 1984 , even the still-squeamish New York Times could not resist running on its front page a Columbus Day photograph ( absent from this exhibit ) of Walter Mondale , Mario Cuomo , and Geraldine Ferraro stepping gaily around some horse manure on the parade route ; there has rarely been a picture of politicians more joyfully in their element . <p> The camera may not lie , but that fact has misled many photographers and viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutter it speaks the truth , whereas , like the human mouth , as often as not , it says nothing at all . The MOMA show is mercifully short of Avedon , whose coroner 's style of portraiture remains utterly unrevealing  --  totally individuating , yes , but in the way of a DNA smear , and no more evocative of character or essence than that . His Eisenhower , wan and wall-eyed , is of course meant to surprise us with some sort of meaningfully reversed expectations , but it does n't , any more than a driver's-license photo exerts any strong claim as truth or art . More thought-provoking , and certainly amusing , is a 1945 Life photograph of the general returning to his mother 's front porch in Abilene , Kansas . She is the one wearing a big grin , looking more like Ike than he does . <p> When the camera does manage to say something , it often does so by indirection , or even inversion , like the reliable source whose yes can be counted on to mean no . Jacqueline Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being eluded , that her realest part is somewhere else , held in reserve , a glamorous mystery . In fact , Mrs. Kennedy is fully present , fully in control , projecting mystery into the camera with more art than that mustered by most of the thousands of photographers who took her picture . Her talent was something opposite to that of Ronald Reagan , a man who , in so many photos one remembers , made himself seem fully present to the camera , shaking your hand with his eye , while all the time a part of him , probably the best and most interesting part , was somewhere else . No photographer ever " got " Reagan any more than a biographer will . There 's no here there . <p> Pat Nixon lacked the acting skills of either of these two . Her face , full of intelligence , is more directly present than either Mrs. Kennedy 's or Reagan 's ; one sees her straining to cooperate in a situation she can not bear but knows she must , unable to displace herself mentally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing she appears to be is plastic , a word with which she was always scorned , but which , in the application of its simple physical meaning to camera-subject relations , seems made for Jackie and Reagan and painfully inapplicable to her . <p> The photo opportunity , which came in with Teddy Roosevelt ( shown here riding a steam shovel and weighing some skinny boys in a New York hospital ) , brought politicians to a point of maximum power over the camera , allowing them to be a different sort of actor from the kind they had been playing since the Roman forum . The oratorical ham gave way to the silent player of tableau vivant , which required little more than the ability , after hours of someone else 's advance work , to show up when the flashbulb popped . Even after its cornball apotheosis with Fiorello LaGuardia , who drove rivets , cut ribbons , smashed slot machines , and pretended to fight fires to shamelessly good effect , the photo op was n't exhausted . A 1952 Cornell Capa shot of Adlai Stevenson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sits beneath a tree on his Illinois farm , can still probably fool some of the people some of the time  --  though Al Gore , who sits next to Bill Clinton in " Family Help , " a 1993 AP photo of the president and vice president talking " on telephones in the Oval Office . . . to families who were forced to choose between their jobs and time off to care for children or ailing parents , " seems to be overacting his way through a tryout for the St. Albans class play . He makes Clinton look positively genuine . <p> Photo opportunities have , on occasion , undone the lesser lights of political theater . The current exhibition offers two wince-inducing examples , the first of them from September 1947 , in which Governor Thomas E. Dewey appears to be performing chiropractic upon a cow . Whatever he 's doing in his freshly pressed suit , it 's certainly not milking . Forty years later , Michael Dukakis , the closest thing to Dewey the Democrats ever came up with , rides an M1-A-1 battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the George Bush presidential library . <p> The camera does sometimes succeed in differentiating the mere phony from , to use a term of Truman Capote 's , the " real phony , " that preferable entity who actually " believes all this crap he believes . " ( In this show , William Jennings Bryan and James Garfield , each of them photographed in a six-button coat and trying to look as Napoleonic as possible , provide a study in contrasts between the former species and the latter . ) The current exhibit provides few depictions of politicians in truly unguarded moments , but the most pleasing of these comes from Atlantic City c. 1928 , when Al Smith and his plump , giggling wife crowded into a photo booth and made two four-shot strips , unfiltered and fully human . <p> The Happy Warrior is also shown in an Indian headdress ( " Governor Smith Becomes Chief ' Leading Star ' " ) , a venerable subgenre of political photography . The show gives us Jimmy Walker similarly attired , and of course , Calvin Coolidge , who looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a negligee for the camera . George Bush , going halfway as usual , accepts a ceremonial pipe from Crow medicine-man Floyd Realbird in Billings , Montana , but instead of trying on Realbird 's magnificent bonnet , Bush is pointing toward his waiting limo . <p> In recent years the photographer has regained a certain power over the politician . The lenses are longer and less merciful than ever , and now tricks like " morphing " allow for such uncannily apt editorializing as Time 's recent series of a half-dozen photos in which Bill Clinton turns into Jimmy Carter . But recent photo ops seem less autonomous than the older ones , more like millimeters of a video you 've got on Pause . After all , you 've seen these images on video ; you know what comes just before and after them , and it 's frustrating not to be able to scroll them forward or backward . Was n't it , in fact , the waggle , i.e. , the movement , of Dukakis 's helmeted head , like one of those dolls with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's absurdity ? Even so , still photography invites greater contemplativeness , and it 's only in Michael E. Samojeden 's AP photo that you 're likely to spot the person actually driving the tank , who 's keeping his head sensibly hidden behind a gun . <p> Occasionally , a single photograph in this exhibition will call up many moods , such as one from 1977 that gives us a group including Carter , Robert Byrd , and Tip O'Neill , all dewlaps and wattles and perplexity , a ridiculous picture of one-party gridlock  --  comical until you realize that the emaciated fellow with the wisps of hair at the picture 's left is the gallant , dying Hubert Humphrey . But it says something fine about the national character and the essentially untragic history of the United States that irreverent and humorous pictures make up as large a part of this show as they do . The camera 's true historical focus here is less on the familiar faces than on all the tiny heads looking up at the platforms and waving from the sidewalks , row upon row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mere extras who made up the crowd scenes , but in fact the people who , however imperfectly , ran the show . <p> PHOTO : Tricky Dick takes to the air . <p> PHOTO : All dewlaps and wattles and perplexity . <p> by Thomas Mallon <p> <p> Thomas Mallon 's latest book is the novel Henry and Clara <p> <p>
