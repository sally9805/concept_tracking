<p> Tonya Arnold adores her 4-year-old son , Robert . <p> " I read to him every day , to teach him about the world , " she said . " He loves for me to read the ' Three Little Pigs ' and other fairy tales . " <p> Even though Robert enjoys fairy tales , Ms. Arnold knows and accepts reality . <p> " He 's a handful and I just could n't imagine myself with another child . . . at least not in the next couple of years , " she said . <p> Like an estimated 150,000 other U.S. women over the past year , Ms. Arnold chose Norplant - six matchstick-size capsules inserted in the upper arm that release low dosages of levonorgestrel for five years . The contraceptive is marking its first anniversary of availability this month . <p> " I 've had no major problems with Norplant and I know it 's the best thing for me at this time in my life , " said Ms. Arnold , 25 . <p> Wendy Anderson 's experience with the implant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I got the Norplant , my menstrual cycle started and did n't want to stop , " she said . " I tried to give my system time to adjust , but I just could n't take it anymore . " <p> Ms. Anderson , 19 , received Norplant in late March and experienced heavy bleeding until she had it removed in August . <p> The side effect Ms. Anderson experienced is n't rare , said Mark Perloe , director of fertility and in vitro fertilization at Georgia Baptist Medical Center . He inserted Ms. Anderson 's Norplant . <p> " We have done close to 250 insertions and most women experience breakthrough bleeding , but to different degrees , " he said . " Another thing we must realize is Norplant may react differently with different women - we have to remember that . " <p> Side effects are n't the only problem with the implant . Poor women and those on Medicaid will have a harder time getting the implant . And some fear it may be used as a forced form of birth control . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norplant as a coercive method for women who have been convicted of child abuse , " said Julia Scott , director of the public policy and education office of the National Black Women 's Health Project . " Those women do n't need help with not having children ; they need psychiatric attention . " <p> Though Norplant is heating up legislative chambers , it is a popular contraceptive because of its low failure rate - 1 percent . But popularity does n't come without drawbacks . Some of its frequently reported side effects - usually during the first months of use - are prolonged menstrual bleeding , unexpected bleeding or spotting between periods , no bleeding for several months , or a combination of these patterns . Some other less reported side effects are headaches , nervousness , nausea , dizziness , acne and weight gain . <p> Despite the side effects , Dr. Perloe is confident about the implant , though he said it may not be for everyone . <p> " I know it 's one of the most effective forms of birth control other than sterilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only good for women who do n't mind dealing with the side effects . " <p> But these side effects did n't scare Ms. Arnold . She remembers her decision to use the implant as an easy one . <p> " I had trouble with oral contraceptives . I would get sick to my stomach and sometimes have to miss work , " she said . " I needed a change , a better alternative . " <p> She looked at tubal ligation as a quick answer , but soon discovered that her physician was not in favor of permanent sterilization for someone her age . <p> " My doctor would tell me I was too young and that I could meet ' Mr. Right ' and want to have more kids . . . . Who knows what the future holds ? " Ms. Arnold said . <p> She researched other methods and read about Norplant . Convinced of its effectiveness , she called Grady Memorial Hospital and received her implant on March 11 , 1991 . Being one of the first women in Atlanta to receive Norplant was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it more so . They all received implants on the same day . <p> " I told them all about it , and I knew it was a better option , " Ms. Arnold said . <p> Grady and Georgia Baptist Medical Center , like many other urban hospitals , were part of a national pilot program that trained doctors in the implant procedure . <p> Maxine Keel , administrative assistant in Grady 's Family Planning Division , said , " Lots of women were skeptical at first , but now lots of women want Norplant . But since the company is having problems keeping up with the demand , we are not able to set up a good and consistent Norplant clinic . " <p> When the training program began , most women in the Atlanta area were not aware of Norplant . Ms. Keel said she recruited a variety of women , including single mothers , low-income women not eligible for Medicaid and working women who could n't afford the $ 640 fee . <p> " Since it was a chance of a lifetime , I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Ms. Keel said . <p> Any woman who received Norplant at Grady or Georgia Baptist between March and October received it free . <p> In Georgia , 416 Medicaid patients received Norplant between September and November , the only months for which figures are available . Private insurance does n't cover Norplant , so women interested in it must pay $ 600 to $ 750 for the implant . But even private doctors who accept Medicaid patients are hesitant about performing the 20-minute procedure . <p> " About 65 percent of my patients are Medicaid recipients , but I do n't do Norplant insertions because I 'll only get $ 40 to $ 50 profit , " said Dr. Robert Williams Jr. , a private obstetrician and gynecologist . " And for the time , anesthesia and assistance from my staff , that 's just not enough . " <p> More than 200 Georgia doctors are trained to insert the device , but since the product is still new , figures are not yet available on how many are actually inserting Norplant . And like other states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling back orders . <p> Legislation is being proposed in Hawaii , Kansas , Louisiana , Ohio , South Carolina and California that not only affects child abusers , but welfare mothers as well . In Ohio and South Carolina , bills are being proposed that would force women convicted of child or drug abuse to receive Norplant or get time in jail . <p> " We are setting the stage for a tragic display of power if we let lawmakers deny women the right to choose birth control and the form they are most comfortable using , " Ms. Scott said . <p> However , Dr. Perloe sees both sides of the issue . <p> " I try to do everything to talk my patients out of getting Norplant , so when they decide to use the device it 's because they want it , not because I gave them a long , coercive speech , " he said . <p> And Ms. Arnold could n't see using any other contraceptive . <p> " I believe it 's an excellent form of birth control , and until I make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , " she said .
