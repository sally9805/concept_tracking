THE COW WAS DONE . Ben slapped her flank and moved his head back , hot . The warm milk 's streaming stopped . Flies settled by her tail . She shat . The barn cats licked the gutter when he raised the pail . He disliked the smell of it , the heat of it , the ripe spread new-mown hay . There were pigeons in the rafters ; they shifted , ululated . Light spilled thickly through . October , and the split-leaf maple flaming by the toolshed and the tamaracks beginning to go yellow by the fence-line , the oak at the crest of the hill ; it was as if  --  he wiped his wet cheek , lifted , turned  --  the light above were pouring from the spigot of the sky . <p> The kitchen chimney smoked . He watched its coned dispersal into air . There were horses in the meadow  --  Aristotle , Amos , and the chestnut mare they pastured for his father 's cousin Samuel who had gone to war . His fingers ached . He rubbed them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds of music , and that meant his uncle played , and that would mean he had a lesson and would have to practice ; from tit to fiddle , his uncle declared , that 's how a gentleman goes . Hiram , said Ben 's mother . Well , it 's true , said Hiram Thompson , I call a spade a spade . <p> Now that Ruth Thompson had married again his uncle visited seldom . He smoked a pipe at table . He left his beard unclipped . He owned too much land , he said , to mind the country notions of his kin . When Ben 's mother had been left a widow , she tilted her cap jauntily and married Mr. Pierce . Then they left Grandfather 's house . Josiah Pierce is not a bad man , Hiram said , and he gives you a good home , my boy , but there 's no music in it so I bring the violin . <p> Hiram played it well . He could hear a tune just once and later on repeat it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered in your seat . Ben went to Mr. Fowle 's school , and then to Byfield down the road , and then to Mr. Hill 's in Medford . All of them were dull . Mr. Fowle taught Latin and had been a taskmaster but was sleepy , ancient now , and nodded at his desk . Loammi Baldwin knew as much about The Universal Spelling Book as did Mr. Fowle ; he could do a sum so quickly in his head that you were busy copying while he had the answer , and the answer was correct . <p> pre Woburn Aug 16th 1769Mr . Loammi Baldwin Sir Please to inform me in what manner fire opperates upon Clay to Change the Colour from the Natural Colour to red and from red to Black &c; and how it operates upon Silver to Change it to Blue <p> I am Your most Huml &; obedient ServantBenjamin Thompson God Save the King <p> His bookplate bore his crest ; he fashioned it himself . He engraved a set-square and dividers , a vessel under sail . He drew a stout tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top right corner , and a radiating sun . A lion lay beneath . He drew an open book , a sword , a closed book , and a shield ; the shield bore the name B. Thompson . <p> His mother was Ruth Simonds , the eighth child of the union of James and Mary Simonds ; Mary was the daughter of James and Mary Fowle . His father had been born the son of Ebenezer and Hannah Convers Thompson ; Ebenezer was the son of Jonathan and Frances , Jonathan the son of Elizabeth and James . His father and his mother were married on May 30 , 1752 , and he himself came crying forth next twenty-sixth of March . His father died November 7 , 1755 , at the age of twenty-six . <p> Love is a Noble Passion of the mind . That was what he copied in his schoolbook : LOVE . He drew a set of bosoms and the head of a donkey upon it ; I 'm fashioning my idol in the likeness of an ass . <p> Each spring they planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set cabbage seeds and turnips and onions and potatoes down and covered them again . Josiah Pierce said nothing like potatoes for new ground . Ben hated it  --  the hard cold earth , the grime beneath his fingernails , the reek that in his nostrils flared of cautious penury . At table he desired to be served . Instead he poured the broth himself  --  the gristle floating in it , the shreds of meat , the bone . He asked his mother once what food the wealthy ate , and she said , Ben , the wealthy eat their food for sustenance , they swallow just the way that we do and to the same purpose . Use your spoon . <p> Ben got sixteen shillings every year . He would get that sum , his uncle said , until he was fourteen ; your grandfather was generous , my boy . Ebenezer Thompson had provided for his children , and his children 's children too . There was an arrangement for your mother till she married ; she had one half of the garden at the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now she has a husband to do it , so I save myself the trouble to my back . <p> Hiram laughed . He lit his pipe . In addition , eighty weight of beef , eight bushels of rye , two bushels of malt , two barrels of cider , three bushels of apples to keep : your grandfather was generous indeed . Old Ebenezer , if I ai n't much mistaken , bequeathed you fifty acres on the north side of the hill . Count yourself among the fortunate , said Hiram , and make certain you can count . <p> " ' What doth it profit a man , ' " Josiah Pierce inquired , " ' if he lose his own soul and gain the whole world ? ' " <p> " We was n't talking scripture , " Hiram said . " We was talking testamentary arrangements . " <p> " It 's not a fortune , " warned the prudent Mr. Pierce , " and it wo n't make your fortune but will start you off . You have to be less laggard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother was a farmer 's wife , but Ebenezer Thompson had owned a house in town . Milking , Ben would dream of it  --  the drawing room , the dining room , the visitors from Boston who had been to see the world . Hiram saw the world . He had business in Wilmington and went to Salem often and proposed that Mr. John Appleton , Merchant , teach young Ben the trade . They would set out together for Salem in the morning ; it could not come too soon . <p> His mother doted on him , she declared . He was her blue-eyed boy . He looked the spit and image of his father , who had died untimely , and was growing into just as tall a figure of a man . " Why , Ben , " she said , as he set the milk pail by the kitchen stoop , " we were talking of you , we were saying how we 'll miss you here . " <p> He was leaving with his uncle who had brought the apprenticeship papers . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dinah , wheezing where she stood beside the stove . <p> His mother 's breath was sweet . Her cheeks were pale . <p> Hiram clapped Ben on the shoulder . " He 'll go far . But he wo n't leave Massachusetts , he wo n't go far away . " <p> " No ? " She had had a second son , Josiah Pierce III . She had been crying , Ben saw . Women have that habit ; on the smallest provocation , women weep . <p> " John Appleton 's a worthy master , " Hiram continued . " Learned . And his shop 's well-stocked . You 'll return in triumph , wo n't you Ben ? " <p> " Return I will , " he promised . <p> " You 'll send news ? " <p> " I will . " <p> " You wo n't forget us ? " <p> " No . " <p> Josiah Pierce had entered . He stood listening ; he was standing in the doorway to the hall . He had that quiet way with him ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baited trap . " And your lessons ? " asked Josiah Pierce . " And your prayers ? " <p> " No , sir . " <p> " No ? " <p> " No , sir , I wo n't forget them . " <p> " We want to hear you play your scales . Give us some music , nephew . " <p> " Yes . " He picked up the violin . He smiled at Uncle Hiram , who put resin on the bow . Yet in truth his heart was elsewhere , on the shining path already that would lead him from this place . <p> " And meantime do n't forget "  --  Josiah Pierce insisted  --  " your duty to your mother . " <p> He promised he would not . <p> But once in Salem 's bustling town , under the eye of Mr. John Appleton , he was too busy for worship or music , too gainfully engaged . The Appleton house was big as his grandfather 's , and it included the shop . Ben slept on the third floor . He learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good afternoon , Madam , " and " Good evening , Miss . May I help you ? " he inquired , and they told him yes . <p> He worked at the display . He took pleasure in the twill and various buttons and ribbons and the bright bolts of cloth . They ordered what they wanted , and observed with great particularity while he brought it to them , and they said how much . He carried measures and a rule and shears and pencil , not an axe or pail . He arranged the shelves . He studied the proud bearing of the quality , and by his bed at night he practiced bowing , heels together , hand across his heart . He learned to gauge expense in leather , coat , and carriage ; he could recognize distinction by its cut . He did his sums and read his verses and improved his hand . Clothes make the man , he saw . There were spermaceti candles , calico , and a fine assortment of patches ; the Stamp Act was repealed . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countertop and pounded it for emphasis ; on their arrival , evenings , they fastened the shutters behind . They were soft-voiced when they started and loud by evening 's end . <p> John Appleton entered into a most solemn engagement not to traffic in further commerce with Great Britain ; he would order no more goods with import duties on them . He signed the document . His custom must suffer , he said . His brow was furrowed , heavy , but he said I have no choice . There are certain things a man must do , I 'll honor our agreement , boy , you can stay on if you wish . My books are yours to read . You would be advised to study , and I 'll keep you from the counter : sweep , scrub , paint . <p> So he fell to doing chores again , as if this were the farm . He admired Mary Appleton , who had turned seventeen . Snow blanketed the yard . The shop was rarely frequented , the house a quiet place . Now Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets and gathered on the green . Ben fashioned fireworks with powder , sulfur , saltpeter , and charcoal . John Appleton instructed him ; there 's much to do with powder now , he said . And if we sell these fireworks you may keep a quarter of the profit for yourself . <p> The Composition for middle Size Rockets may Serve for Serpents and for Raining Fire . Ben built compound rockets and recorded the procedure in his book . When you have filled the Rocket within abt. 2 Inches of the Top , he wrote , thrust down a piece of Leather abt. the bigness of the hole of the Rocket &; punch it full of holes in the middle with a bodkin then Strew a little Dust of powder Grownd fine and fill the rest up with unground powder &; Stop up the remaining part with Leather or paper . This was how to build a rocket , and it worked . <p> He ground the powder fine . Mr. Appleton and family were visiting across the way ; he labored on his own . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself at his task . A curricle rolled past . The scent of apple came to him and somewhere on the breeze a hint of cloves . He would never be quite certain how it happened , why it happened , but one minute he was measuring saltpeter , considering the way that Mary Appleton had said that noontime , Ben , you 're growing mightily , but you 're the proper man  --  and the dimple when she said it , the bright eye , the imperious way she swept from the room before he could marshal his tongue-tied retort , before he had imagined what to tell her even , Miss Mary , but are n't you the proper lady to say so , to notice , I 'm delighted by your notice  --  and the next the spark had taken , flared , the powder hissed , exploded , and he was blown up . <p> He remembered the loud light . He remembered the red acrid whiff of it , the high-pitched humming in his ear , the furry vision of his hand above the yellow bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was very little blood : the pain was elsewhere , coursing through a body not his own . It was separate from burning ; it was heat so absolute he thought it chill . Pain was dissevered , rampant , on the ceiling and the floorboards and the wall . Before he fainted Ben was sure he spied a figure in the smoke , a beckoning demon with pitchfork . Except the pitchfork was a hoe and the hoe was white-hot , wand-like , and transmitted flame ; it was only when he touched it that he knew he had been burned . He cried out ; he must have ; people on Essex Street heard . There were shouts he could not answer , and the frantic disapproving solicitous bustle of schoolmaster and merchant , and water pails and blankets and the poultice they applied to him until the doctor came . There was time he could not measure , and the long slow ache of recognition : I survive . Mary Appleton was kind ; she bent above his bed . His mother Ruth lay prostrate in Woburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , said Josiah Pierce . But he did not finish the sentence , compacts with the devil , gets burned . He leaned above Ben carefully ; I 've come to fetch you home . <p> His wounds took weeks to heal . Convalescent , he read ; he slept much . His room was white . Hiram tuned the fiddle for him , but he did not play . Once he dreamed he met his father , who helped him with his sums . His father had the clearest eyes : a fine , straight nose , red hair . " Do n't be afraid , " his father said . " You 're just beginning , son . " <p> " I 'm frightened , " he said anyhow . " I wish you were alive . " <p> I am with you always . " <p> " How so ? " <p> " A bright lad , " said his father . " A questioning intelligence . " He faded . " How indeed ? " <p> Ben listened to the chatter of Dinah in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loud bravura humor of his uncle . He blamed himself for carelessness and dreamed of the harnessed explosion and perfect arching flight . He plotted his escape . Woburn could not hold him now ; this life was not his life . What he had seen in Salem were men engaged in large endeavor , the business of politics and passion of attainment , the speculative bustle of invention , and the trimmed sail of concession to a prevailing wind . <p> He improved . The powder burns on his right forearm healed , and the scar above his eye . He exercised . You 're filling out , said Dinah , you 're on your feet again and too much grown to be so underfoot all day . His brother , young Josiah , was too young . Loammi Baldwin was his friend who lived across the hill . Loammi was nine years older and planned to see the world . That had been his intention , but the Baldwins needed him at home and had no second family to send him on his way . His father was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in study he wielded saw and plane . <p> Sir : Please to give the Nature , Essence , Beginning of Existence , and Rise of the Wind in General , with the Whole theory thereof , so as to be able to answer all Questions relative thereto . <p> And when Loammi answered this he asked again . <p> Sir : Please to give the Direction of the Rays of Light from a Luminous Body to an Opake , and the Reflection from the Opake Body to another equally Dense and Opake ; vizt. the Direction of the Rays of the Luminous Body to that of the Opake , and the Direction of Rays by Reflection to the other Opake Body . Yours &; C. Benj . Thompson N.B. From the Sun to the Earth . Reflected to the Moon at an angle of 40 degrees . <p> And when Loammi answered this they raced each other to the pond , and it was a perfect tie , and they swam across it , and Loammi won . <p> " I have great expectations of you , " Ben announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loammi bowed . <p> " I mean it . " <p> " Yes . No less of you . " Loammi smiled . His smile was modest , affable . His teeth were good . <p> " I plan to go to Boston . " <p> " When ? " <p> " As soon as ever Mr. Hopestill Capen takes me in . I am promised to him and his dry goods by October . " <p> " Yet again , " Loammi said , " you leave us in October . " <p> " ' The Sign of the Cornfields , ' it 's called . I had far rather see a sign than the actuality . Come with me . You 'll find work . " <p> " We 've got the Grange to finish , " said Loammi . " And then the library . " <p> " There 's libraries enough in Boston . You come too . " <p> Loammi did not join him , as he knew would be the case , but Ben set off for Boston nonetheless . His mother wept more openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent  --  a country cap upon his head , a country blend in his carved pipe  --  drove him in the trap . On the outskirts of the city , they had to ask the way . <p> Mr. Hopestill Capen was a Royalist , not a patriot , and therefore his shop prospered as to stock . It stood on Union Street , just off Dock Square . The house was brick , two-story , and Ben enjoyed his private bed at the turn of the back stairs . He wrote to Mr. Appleton to thank him for the reference and ask for his few furnishings  --  the trunk , the desk , the chair-to be forwarded to Boston ; I am most sincerely grateful for all your kindness shown . Never shall I live at a place again that I delighted so much as at Your house nor with a Kinder Master . <p> Mr. Capen did not seem as kind . He had a high-pitched voice , a stutter , sparse red hair . There was tallow on his waistcoat and powder on his collar , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had business in London and had been to visit there , and he spoke of Boston with a weary querulous impatient condescension , as if he were condemned to life among the savages while across the ocean society flourished . " T-t-thompson , " he would say , " you simply f-fail to understand , you have imperfect understanding of the w-wo-world . " <p> " I am here , sir , to improve it . " <p> " Mind you do , bob-boy . Mind you do . " <p> Ben drew " A Council of State . " There were thirteen heads  --  one talking , one sticking out his tongue , one looking like a dog . He drew boats and bottles , pistols , bones . He drew " Harry Modiste , " an old man with a cane and hat ; the jester points and calls to him , " Ha , you red nose , how will you sell your wig ? by the Cord ? " <p> Down the street there was a school for fencing and for French . Mr. Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadside , " to lovers of the noble Science of Defence . " For ten shillings a month he provided instruction in the Back-Sword ; he called it an " Art . " He also taught French " in a most concise Manner and on reasonable Terms . " <p> Ben enrolled . He drew pictures of the proper posture of defense , and practiced with the sword each morning in his room . He had a strong right arm . Mr. McAlpin had one eye and a piratical swagger and swore great rolling oaths in French while he thrust and lunged . " Sacre bleu ! " He parried : " Parbleu . Charognes de gosses ! " He had fought the French in the last war , and claimed they had no equal in the Back-Sword but would sometimes falter in conviction ; you can beat them through endurance , boy , but not in skill . You may practice conjugation but must enlarge your wrist . <p> Ben 's understanding enlarged . In his rare free hours or at night he walked the streets of Boston , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships and purveyors and sailors and the grog shops by the docks . He watched soldiers at parade . He heard men argue politics , protesting the inequity of tax . He met clergy and a black man with a parrot on his shoulder , saw a one-legged infant scuttling where the daylight beggars slept . Ben moved among the tinkers , grocers , red men , blacksmiths , cooks , attenuated shapes that breathed upon the paving blanketed in rags ; they sang , they moaned and muttered so he knew they were alive . By the chandler 's dory he saw commerce : dice and bulldog , fighting cocks . <p> " Young sir , " a woman called . <p> He went to her . <p> " Got a shilling , darling ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> She bit it , then lifted her skirt . <p> McAlpin took him roistering to bawdy house and brothel ; twice , McAlpin paid . One girl had the coloring and guise of Mary Appleton ; Ben fancied her particularly and visited three times . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconsolate and drank strong ale till morning , who had been abstemious , and his head felt like a bladder and his hand shook at the counter so that Mr. Hopestill Capen asked him if he were unwell , if he had contracted palsy in addition to the pox . <p> " No sir . " <p> " I have written to your mother . I have tot-told her you must mend your ways . " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> " I find you more often under the counter , with gimlets , knife , and saw , constructing some little machine or looking over some book of science , than arranging c-c-cloths behind it . " " Sir . " <p> " We have c-c-customers here , Thompson . We have custom to attend to . " <p> " Sir . " <p> " You may go now , Thompson . I had rather you sleep lying down than upon your f-f-feet . " <p> So he was dismissed to Woburn and returned there yet again . This was a falling off . He was seventeen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay his debts . Josiah Pierce grew more severe , his mother less indulgent , and his hours in the forest were put to proper use . He cut and loaded logs and stacked and sold what Ebenezer Thompson had bequeathed him on the hill . He learned a saying as to wood : it will warm you thrice  --  once when cutting , once when splitting , once when burning . Add to this the exercise of loading , dragging , hauling , stacking , and each tree is severally productive . <p> Ben noted how the sawteeth bit according to the log . The locust branch was hotter work than apple , the apple than maple , the maple than oak . He told Loammi Baldwin he could gauge the kind of wood he cut by how hot the blade . In June he and Loammi wrote a plan for " forming a Society amongst us for Propagateing Learning and usefull Knoledge , by Means of Questions to be Proposed to a Certain Number of Person 's and each Person to bring his answer to said Quest propos 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with profit and read Boerhaave 's treatise on Fire admiringly out loud . He told his friend of revels in the city , the worldly lures of Boston and the soldiers in the streets . There had been a massacre ; he heard reports . Four citizens were shot . Loammi knew no French . <p> They went fishing to Nahant . They made a party with Abijah Thompson , Ben 's cousin , and Loammi and Dr. John Hay . It was a clear day , and a pleasant one , and they engaged in scientific observation and banter and caught quantities of mackerel and cod . <p> Ben went to fetch the horses and left Loammi cleaning fish ; Dr. Hay and Abijah Thompson left too . At the inn they shared a meal , and Dr. Hay said , " Thompson , you should study with me , I will teach you what I know . " They discussed this eagerly , and Dr. Hay impressed upon him the advantages of medicine ; they contracted then and there for Ben to start his studies and his lodgings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an excellent career , " said Abijah , " there 's always someone sick or dying , " and they drank a toast to celebrate the new physician 's future , and only back in Woburn did he recollect Loammi at Nahant still cleaning fish . <p> It 's betrayal , said Loammi , it is callous disregard . I was gutting them and wetting them and making myself nauseated whilst you three were drinking and disporting ; I brought back all that fish alone and in a hired trap . I am most heartily sorry , said Ben , I should not do what I did . Your apology , Loammi said , if heartfelt is sufficient . It is heartfelt indeed , Ben insisted , pinching himself cruelly so as not to laugh . <p> " Why does the flame of a candle tend upwards in a spiral ? " <p> " Why is the sound of clicking stones transmitted and not dispelled by water ? " <p> " What is the reason the tides rise higher in the Bay of Fundy than the Bay of Delaware ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melted ; what loss of water in steam ? " <p> " Does the same proportion hold for tea ? " <p> " Whence comes the dew that stands on the outside of a tankard that has cold water in it in the summertime ? " <p> " At what point , viewed from the equator , appears the gibbous moon ? " <p> So he moved to Dr. Hay 's house and resolved on a career . Each day he devoted to study and Sunday ate at home . He worked hard . He contrived a learning schedule : Monday  --  Anatomy , Tewsday  --  Anatomy , Wednesday  --  Institutes of Physic , Thursday  --  Surgery , Fryday  --  Chimistry with the Materia Medica , Saturday  --  Physic 1/2 &; Surgery 1/2 . <p> Mrs. Hay was kindly , bustling , busy with her household and three children and their clamorous imperatives : food , clothing , cleanliness , heat . Benjamin perceived the order of the day . He set himself thereafter to abide by order also , and made himself a schedule that he pinned above the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash hands and faceFrom 6 a.m. until 8 a.m Exercise and study " 8 a.m. " 10 a.m Prayers and breakfast " 10 a.m. " 12 noon Study " 12 noon " 1. p.m Dine " 1 p.m. " 4. p.m Study continualy " 4 p.m. " 5. p.m Diversion or exercise " 5 p.m. " 11. p.m Follow what my inclination leads me to . What his inclination led him to was Abigail the children 's nurse who slept behind the nursery and took him in at night . He doted on her legs . They were long and white and fine and when she raised them for him he felt himself wholly a man . She whimpered , tossed , and pitched . She flattered him , gasping , convulsive . She gave him his first lessons in the lexicon of pleasure , the anatomy of love . This was what he studied Mondays , Tuesdays in the book , Anatomy , and when the children were asleep and Dr. and Mrs. Hay had retired yawning to their quarters , Ben took off his shoes and tiptoed down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was let in with no candle and took off his trousers and his shirt . She lit the candle , barred the door , and turned to him on her incomparable legs and said , " It hurts here , doctor , touch this swelling , press this breast . " <p> He started at her toes . He kissed her metatarsals and the Joinings of her ankle and her calf and knee and thigh . He delighted her entirely , she said . He delighted in her also and repeated her name often , since this was his first woman with a name . They had great times together but one morning she was sullen , sallow , and by evening had departed and he never did learn why . He made inquiries . He could not ask too often for fear of troubling Dr. Hay , who had turned a blind eye to his nightlong revels and his daytime torpor . He did not know if Abigail went willingly or had been dismissed . He knew she came from Cambridge but did not know her family address . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you do n't know will not injure you and ignorance is bliss . We 've lived our whole life , Ben protested , disdainful of that proposition , and you tell me now to embrace it . Loammi said , I do . <p> <p> By NICHOLAS DELBANCO <p>
