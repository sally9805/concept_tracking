During the last decade of his life , Henry David Thoreau ( 1817-62 ) began a systematic survey of the Massachusetts vegetation surrounding Concord , where he lived in the third-floor attic of his parents ' house . His mission , as he told his journal , was " to find God in nature , " the Transcendental imperative he absorbed from his mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson . True , the 26 months Thoreau had spent living alone in a cabin by Walden Pond , memorialized in Walden ( 1854 ) , involved a similar quest for some " trace of the Ineffable , " but now he wanted to remove himself from the center of his observations and let the natural objects he studied speak for him . He hoped , in short , to be less romantic and more scientific . <P> That he only partly succeeded is one of the many charms of Wild Fruits ( Norton ; 409 pages ; $29.95 ) , which finally sees print thanks to the heroic editing efforts of Thoreau scholar Bradley Dean . Thoreau left the Wild Fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , but much jumbling and shuffling occurred as the papers passed from owner to owner . That confusion , plus Thoreau 's notoriously hen-scratched handwriting , kept Wild Fruits a closed book until now . Readers will find that its preserved contents have aged not at all . <P> In one sense , the freshness of Thoreau 's long-undeciphered writings should surprise no one . He , along with Mark Twain , essentially invented the plain but supple American prose style , carefully composed to sound casual . So , to stress the point that " high blueberries " must be looked for in swamps , Thoreau writes , " When I see their dense curving tops ahead , I expect a wet foot . " He dresses his adages in homespun : " All kinds of harvestry , even pulling turnips when the first cold weather numbs your fingers , are interesting if you have been the sower and have not sowed too many . " <P> Thoreau orders Wild Fruits as a botanist might , collecting his notes on each plant in the order in which it blooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements he has made : " September 24 , 1859 . The common shrub oak is apparently the most fertile of our oaks . I count two hundred sixty-six acorns on a branch just two feet long . " But he has trouble keeping poetry out of his descriptions : " August 23 , 1858 . Abundantly shedding its downy seeds , wands of white and pink . " And sometimes the objective mask slips completely : " July 30 , 1860 . Beautiful . " <P> The tension between Thoreau the naturalist and Thoreau the missionary for nature 's wonders invigorates nearly every page of Wild Fruits . He portrays his subjects with keen clarity , but he also wants his Concord neighbors to wake up to the error of their ways : " We cultivate imported shrubs in our front yards for the beauty of their berries , while at least equally beautiful berries grow unregarded by us in the surrounding fields . " He argues passionately against the careless destruction of the wilderness around him . Hearing that huckleberry pickers in his area have been ordered off privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true value of country life  --  what , if you must go to market for it ? It has come to this , that the butcher now brings round our huckleberries in his cart . "
