<p> With its stately walkways , clustered palm trees and granite column topped by a goddess of Liberty , Union Square is one of San Francisco 's most famous landmarks . But now the city is poised to change the square forever  --  perhaps drastically . <p> Frustrated that downtown 's once-regal plaza now looks bedraggled , local business and planning groups have sponsored a design competition seeking a new look for Union Square . A winner will be announced Monday after judges this weekend sort through 309 proposals . <p> The contest has emerged as one of the architectural events of the year , with entries from 20 states and 10 nations . Closer to home , though , many architects are nervous . What 's new is n't necessarily better , they say  --  and a bad design could wind up harming one of the nation 's last strong urban retail districts . <p> " This is not some little design question ; it 's a major issue for the region , " said Daniel Solomon , one of the nation 's best- known planners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Bay Area . It is the center of the center . " <p> The contest comes at a crucial time for Union Square and its surrounding blocks . <p> In many ways the square is healthy : Rental rates for shops rival those of Rodeo Drive and Madison Avenue . New arrivals run the gamut from the high style of Giorgio Armani and Prada to such mass culture icons as Nike and The Disney Store . <p> At the same time , the district has lost ground with Bay Area residents because of competition from upscale suburban rivals that include Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek and Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto . A distinctive Union Square could reinforce the idea that San Francisco has a unique luster  --  but many neighbors say today 's square is a detriment rather than a drawing card . <p> " It looks like a poor cousin , " said Linda Mjellam , executive director of the Union Square Association , which represents nearby businesses . " Right now , it 's not inviting . We can do better . " <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , things do n't seem so bad : Grass and palm trees catch the eye . There 's an alluring dignity to the sense of a formal garden surrounded by tall buildings . <p> Walk in , however , and the scene changes . The concrete floor is cracked , only seven of the 16 tall boxwoods remain , and the flower beds look like something assembled at a nursery half-off sale . Hedges were torn out last year to make the square seem safer , but the grass that replaced them does n't match the other lawns . <p> Tourists visit with guidebooks ; skateboarders arrive at dusk . Street people use the square as a refuge . Other than that , few people linger . <p> " If you see any locals , they be homeless , " a panhandler who identified himself as Michael said last week . " This is where tourists go mostly . " <p> Grumblings about the square 's tawdry condition have been heard for years , but the notion of a design contest did n't surface until Mayor Willie Brown suggested it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the city to raise funds and draw up rules . <p> Yet success is not assured . <p> One West Coast city , Portland , showed how a design contest can create a space that revives an area . But a contest in Los Angeles led to a rejected design , and the square finally built is ignored by nearby workers and shoppers . <p> " Too often , competitions create excitement instead of places for people to enjoy , " said John Kriken , former San Francisco Art Commission president and a partner at Skidmore Owings &; Merrill , the city 's largest architectural firm . " We could spend a lot of money on ideas that make it less friendly , less of a relief from urban pressures than it is now . " <p> Indeed , three blocks away from Union Square is San Francisco 's own example of how a new square , figuratively , can fall on its face . When the renovated Market Street opened in the 1970s , Hallidie Plaza alongside the cable car turntable was to be a lively gathering place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Backers of the competition stress the potential benefits of the change . And in any case , they say Union Square is overdue for attention . <p> " Union Square has more impact on shaping the city 's image and character than almost any other space , " said Gerald Green , the city 's planning director and a contest judge . " Right now , the message it sends is that the city is not taking care of its resources . " <p> In fact , the current design by legendary San Francisco architect Timothy Pfleuger may be the least of the square 's problems : The city has neglected it for years . <p> Only one gardener is assigned there full-time ; the total expense by the Recreation and Park Department for Union Square is less than $ 100,000 . That 's one-sixth the money that goes into Portland 's Pioneer Courthouse Square , a space roughly one-third the size . <p> But even if the square sparkled , many observers say the layout prevents it from ever being a true gathering place for the city . <p> Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city block that slopes 27 feet . The garage entrances block access to the square except from corners . <p> The result : From Geary Street , where most people are , the entrance is up narrow steps and the view inside is confusing . Even if part of the garage 's top level and one of its entrances are removed , it wo n't be easy under these circumstances to create a place that catches the eye and pulls people in . <p> For some noted designers , that hurdle alone kept them away from the competition . <p> " In my mind it 's not a design issue , it 's a planning issue  --  Union Square has a garage underneath it , " said George Hargreaves , a local architect now working on Boston 's City Hall Plaza . " Unless that changes , a new design is like putting lipstick on a corpse . " <p> But Kriken 's fear is that the urge to " connect " the square to the city will wreck its current sense of being a place apart . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kriken said . " I would like to have more attractions to draw people to the center of the park , but at the same time keep it distinct as a green oasis . " <p> Another dilemma is noted by Karen Alschuler , a planner working on the Mission Bay project near the central waterfront . <p> Alschuler agrees that Union Square needs help . At the same time , a new look that 's too gimmicky could entertain visitors but chase off locals . <p> " There 's a danger that with the wrong design it becomes too much of a tourist focus , " Alschuler said . " What an improved square could do is solidify this as the heart of the region 's retail area  --  a place that attracts Bay Area residents , not just visitors . " <p> That is the point made by planner Solomon : The aim should be to signal the square 's importance in a fitting way , not try to make some grand statement . <p> " Contests sometimes favor things that are polemic , not sensible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel today is seedy . " The winning entry should be one that looks at how the whole block fits together , and understands that Union Square occupies a symbolic role " in marking San Francisco as a healthy city . <p> Solomon did n't enter the contest . One of his architects did , John Ellis . <p> Rather than scrap the current look of Union Square , Ellis tweaked it . For instance , he added a cafe across from Maiden Lane and replaced the Geary Street garage entrance with a grand stairway . <p> " I wanted to enhance what was there , " Ellis said . " I really believe Union Square has a lot that 's right about it . With modest changes it could work very well . " <p> Ellis knows a subtle design runs the risk of being overlooked by judges . So he used bright colors , and made the main drawing as striking as he could . <p> " A competition like this is like a lottery , " Ellis said .

( and ) accommodates a variety of social and cultural activities . " <p> * What 's at stake : The winners receive $ 10,000 and a shot at the city contract to reshape the park . <p> * Who picks the winner : An eight-member jury includes planning director Gerald Green ; former planning director Allan Jacobs ; industrial designer David Kelley ; Los Angeles architect Thom Mayne ; Yale art professor Sheila Levrant de Bretteville ; landscape architect Achva Benzinberg Stein ; Aaron Betsky , curator of architecture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ; and Louis Meunier , executive vice president at Macy 's . <p> * What is off-limits : The Dewey Monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no more than half of the top floor can be removed . <p> * What a new Union Square might cost : Contest rules say the budget can not exceed $ 8 million . <p> * How the city will pay for it : Nobody knows , but " the mayor 's good at finding money when he needs it , " says one insider . <p> * Who wants a change : See above . Mayor Willie Brown first floated the idea , which fits into his quest to leave office with a transformed and spiffy city as a legacy . <p> * Who does n't : Local preservationists say the square , built in 1942 , deserves official landmark status . Other critics say most problems would go away if the city took better care of the square , though they 're open to such changes as adding a cafe . <p> * What 's next : Winners will be announced Monday morning .
