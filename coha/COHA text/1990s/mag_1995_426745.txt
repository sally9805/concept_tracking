<p> For millions with heart problems , an age of miracles has come . Doctors now routinely stop heart attacks and prevent recurrences in ways that would have been considered magic 50 years ago <p> In any age of miracles , miracles become boring . We become as accustomed to them as we do to everything else in our lives and save our interest and excitement for things that appear new and different . As moviegoers were reminded last summer , humanity 's third trip to the moon was so ho-hum that television networks did not pay much attention , at least not until that chilling " Houston , we 've had a problem . " <p> Every once in a while , though , we remember that we all live always in an age of miracles . Some are natural . Look up in time to see clouds turn pink , red , orange , purple . A cliche . Ah , but imagine if sunsets happened only once every 50 years . People would build their lives around them . Look at a baby . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year , but each one of us was , too . Yet every time I hold my new granddaughter and wonder just how small the capillaries in her little fingers really are , it 's quite clear to me that I am in the presence of a miracle . <p> Then there are the miracles that we humans have been able to pull off . As in , say , medical miracles . Despite all the illnesses and injuries that doctors still can not cure or heal , miracles are happening nonstop everywhere . Take my recent history . The faithful have noticed my name missing from this column most of the past year and a half . It all had to do with a heart attack and its ensuing complications . The physician who delivered me nearly 60 years ago would be astounded that I survived , and absolutely dumbfounded at the tools available to his counterparts of today . <p> Most heart attacks occur when a blood clot closes off one of the coronary arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle itself . All the muscle downstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will die in a matter of hours . Today , however , when conditions are right , doctors can inject compounds that will dissolve the clot in time to avoid much of the damage . The one most commonly used , known as tPA , is a substance that occurs naturally in the body  --  but only in minute quantities . No problem . Nowadays genetically engineered bacteria in fermentation tanks turn out the stuff by the barrelful . My heart attack is stopped . Some damage has been done , but it could have been worse  --  as in fatal . <p> Presumably that narrowed artery is still just as narrow , and another clot could come along at any time . The doctors want to know how much damage has been done , and which artery is blocked and where . All along they have been taking electrocardiograms , which record the electrical signals from the heart 's muscle activity on a moving chart . Next is an echocardiogram , which works much like the sonograms that let us " see " unborn babies . The image on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The machine is bouncing inaudible , very high frequency sound waves off the pulsing heart to form an image . The physician can actually see which parts of the heart are working well and which are not . <p> Only the beginning . Now the patient is wheeled into the nuclear medicine department for a thallium stress test . Thallium is an obscure , poisonous metal . In one form it is radioactive , constantly giving off high-energy gamma rays . For the test you are wired up to the electrocardiograph and an IV line is stuck into your arm . You walk on a treadmill , faster and faster , until you and the doctor agree you have had enough . Then the thallium is injected through the IV line , and you lie down on a table shaped like a trough to keep you as still as possible . The thallium attaches itself to red blood cells and will show which parts of the heart are getting a good blood supply and which are not . You are now a radioactive source , spewing out gamma rays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the physicists , records the location each time a gamma-ray photon strikes it . ( If the angle is right , you can watch the image take shape on a monitor . ) <p> The thallium stress test is best at looking at the walls of the heart . Another , similar test is best for determining how well the heart is pumping . Doctors want to know what the ejection fraction is , how much of the blood present in the left ventricle is pushed out to the body when the ventricle contracts . In a healthy person , this is around 60 percent ( mine is down to 30 ) . The main difference is that this time another radioactive element , technetium , is used in place of thallium . <p> The general practitioner who had delivered me had sat by the bed of many a coronary victim , with absolutely no way to " see " where and how bad the damage was . He also had no way of seeing which coronary artery was blocked where , much less a way of fixing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today 's interventional cardiologists , he might well have muttered " miracle . " <p> Nowadays cardiac catheterization is routine . The doctor inserts the catheter into an artery that is conveniently near the surface in the groin . Guided by x-ray images , he works the catheter upstream until it is in the aorta , the finger-size blood vessel through which oxygenated blood first exits the heart proper . From here the doctor can actually go into the heart or turn the catheter down one of the coronary arteries . He then squirts a dye that is opaque to x rays out the tip of the catheter , so whatever he is looking at will stand out on the fluoroscope . <p> In my case the villain turned out to be an artery that moves down the front surface of the heart , the left anterior descending , a.k.a. the widowmaker . Its silhouette changed abruptly from the thickness of a straw to the thickness of a thread . Not only was almost nothing getting through , but even a small clot could cause another heart attack . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Decisions were made . A few weeks later , when my heart had had a chance to heal a little , my own interventional cardiologist went ahead with angioplasty . He worked another catheter up into the blockage , then threaded a wire with a deflated balloon at the tip through the catheter . He slowly inflated the balloon to mash the mess of cholesterol , foam cells and even swollen cells from the artery lining itself back into the walls of the artery to open up the middle , the opening through which blood could flow . Again and again he advanced the balloon and inflated it , burrowing a new channel and a new lease on life for me . <p> And so I went home , with my heart healing and all systems go . My age of miracles was not yet over , however . As happens with 40 percent or so of even the best angioplasties , the artery began to close again five months later . My doctor inserted a catheter , shot some dye and decided that the newly blocked portion was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went by ambulance to a large medical center to try something so new it was then still called research . Here the doctors inserted a catheter through the groin on the other side and slowly opened the blockage with a balloon , but they also popped open some stainless-steel supports called stents as they moved along . Now the artery was propped open as strongly ( relatively speaking ) as a New York subway tunnel . <p> Unfortunately , as I learned three months later , stents sometimes fill with scar tissue . My man slid in a catheter , took a look and sent me over to the medical center . The team there ran in a catheter , took a look and used a laser beam to blast out the fibrous scar tissue . Home free . <p> Three months later I staggered off a tennis court after only ten minutes of dignified doubles . This time my guy sent me directly to the medical center . They slid in a catheter , took a look and decided the problem was now beyond them . Two hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation in three years . This is a miracle that is 30 years old and is definitely not news . But think about it . I was unconscious at the time , but here 's the kind of thing that goes on . This sentence is from BYPASS , a book written for laypeople by Jonathan L. Halperin , a cardiologist , and Richard Levine , a journalist : " He inserts the blade of a small surgical jigsaw at the neck and , with both hands , yanks it down Mr.  --  ' s chest , splitting the bone like seasoned pine . " A rib spreader , a device that looks as if it belongs in an auto mechanic 's kit , pulls the ribs apart so the surgeon has a space six inches wide and nine inches long in which to work . <p> The real art is attaching the tubes that will carry venous blood to the heart-lung machine and bring back oxygenated blood  --  and then deliberately stopping the heart . The machine is started , and the heart is stopped . Time is of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the body are now attached to blocked arteries at points downstream from the blockages . This means sewing vessels , some smaller than cocktail straws , together so well that they are bloodtight  --  and doing it when everything is wet and slippery . The surgeon clamps the aorta , stopping the flow of blood , before he attaches the other ends of the grafts to it . Finally , as part of a routine this team performs several times a day , they start up the heart again and wean it off the machine . Good as new . Tennis , anyone ? <p> Our times are a golden age for physics , which is close to determining the ultimate constituents of matter and the theory of everything . The same is true for astronomy , which is now seeing the Universe for what it is , bubbles of universes made mostly of dark matter . Molecular biology is slowly acquiring the ability to cure genetic diseases and give crops whatever characteristics we want . And while medicine is still locked in trench warfare with any number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of people with heart problems , this is an age of miracles . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : At the tip of a guide wire is the balloon that will be inflated to open an artery . <p> By John P.
