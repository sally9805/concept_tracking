<p> Arthur Levitt , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , called on some of Wall Street 's leaders in the summer of 1994 with a warning . <p> Congress was asking pointed questions about whether complex financial contracts called derivatives could topple a major financial institution or even threaten the financial system . Wall Street , he said , should do something . It did . <p> The following spring , six of the biggest Wall Street investment firms released a plan to tighten their own controls of derivatives while giving regulators greater access to their records . The firms , it was argued , knew best how to manage their own risky world of finance and might even create a model of self-regulation . <p> But the weaknesses of that system were exposed in September when Long-Term Capital Management , the giant hedge fund with big bets in the derivatives market , careered toward collapse , threatening to ignite a global financial panic . Fourteen firms , including all six of those that had favored self-regulation , eventually agreed to rescue Long-Term Capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . <p> The suggestion that one fund 's misstep could harbor such dire consequences has Congress reconsidering how to oversee the derivatives market . <p> " In every previous instance of derivative problems , the industry and the regulators said , ' Do nothing , ' " Representative Edward J. Markey , Democrat of Massachusetts , a member of the House Banking Committee , said in an interview . " But now we see that industry risk management controls were lacking . " <p> Congress has asked a Presidential working group  --  with representatives from the Federal Reserve Board , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  --  to deliver a study in the coming year on the derivatives market and another on the public policy implications of the near collapse of Long-Term Capital . Members of the working group will give a progress report to the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow . Former Fed officials and regulators will also testify before the committee , one of several looking into the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital . <p> Though Congressmen and regulators have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional regulation is spreading beyond just hedge funds and focusing on three broad areas : <p> *New disclosure requirements for hedge funds , which are largely unregulated , and derivatives dealers . These groups might have to reveal their closely guarded trading positions and their risk levels frequently to regulators . The idea has support from much of the financial industry , which says it would at least provide a window on the amount of hedging and the amount of speculating in the market . <p> *Some limit on how much commercial and investment banks can lend to hedge funds like Long-Term Capital or new disclosure on that lending . For example , securities regulators might decide to monitor hedge funds weekly or monthly , rather than rely on the quarterly filings now made to the futures commission . <p> *The creation of a clearinghouse , much like a stock exchange , for the trading of derivatives that do not now have an exchange . A clearinghouse could hold both parties accountable and step in to complete transactions if one party was unable to cover its losses , reducing the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaults . <p> For the most part , brokerage firms now patrol their own risks , and bank regulators tend to focus on overall risk management practices , though they may look at industry sectors or even specific loans if they have a special concern . Hedge funds , which are investment pools open only to wealthy investors , are largely unregulated . <p> Attempts at additional oversight will face stiff opposition from financial industry officials , who consider more regulation costly and cumbersome  --  possibly stifling the smooth functioning of the derivatives markets . Derivatives , so called because their value is derived from an underlying asset like a stock or a bond , allow companies and individuals to manage many types of risk , such as a sudden fluctuation in a currency or an interest rate , throughout the global marketplace . <p> Even Government regulators are torn over how and whether to tighten rules on derivatives . In Washington , officials at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are in a pitched battle with the Treasury , the Fed and the S.E.C. over which agency has jurisdiction and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has faced down oversight before . In late 1994 , Orange County , Calif. , made headlines by declaring bankruptcy after suffering more than $1.6 billion in derivatives-related losses . And the next year , Barings P.L.C. , Britain 's oldest investment bank , collapsed after a 27-year-old trader struck out in the derivatives market . <p> Time and again , after studies and consideration , regulators backed down from wholesale regulation for fear of impeding the market 's growth . Instead , they have made incremental changes in the way banks and brokerage firms  --  the major dealers in the derivatives market  --  handle transactions and support industry efforts at self-regulation . <p> Regulators in other countries are wrestling with the problem as well . Last July , Swiss regulators criticized Europe 's biggest bank , the Union Bank of Switzerland , for weaknesses in its management of derivative risks . Three months later , UBS said it would take a $700 million loss on its business with Long-Term Capital . Since then , Dresdner Bank of Germany and Credit Suisse First Boston have also taken big hits because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's most prestigious financial institutions point to another concern : the giant derivatives market rests on about a dozen global financial institutions , which account for more than half of all derivatives business , according to Swaps Monitor , an industry publication . That concentration troubles some financial experts . <p> " You have huge risks building up on the shoulders of these few huge financial institutions that dominate this market , " said Henry T. C. Hu , a derivatives expert and professor at the University of Texas Law School . " That 's a Herculean task and one that I worry about a little more now that Long-Term Capital almost collapsed . " <p> Though Long-Term Capital is considered unusual in the size of its bets , the extensive amount it borrowed and the number of markets it entered , there is nothing to prevent other investors from getting into similar predicaments . <p> A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests more problems are lurking . In its annual survey of international capital markets , released this fall , the I.M.F . referred to " ticking time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in emerging markets like Asia  --  time bombs that could shake government officials out of their regulatory slumber . The Explosion Not All Derivatives Are Created Equal <p> Derivatives contracts have exploded in the last 10 years as a way for corporations , local governments and others looking to manage risks in the global marketplace . <p> An American company doing business in Japan , for example , might buy an option on the Japanese yen to protect itself against a decline in the currency that could hurt its profits , posted in American dollars . <p> Many derivatives are standardized contracts , like this foreign currency future . These contracts , called " plain vanilla " derivatives , trade on a financial exchange that is regulated . But many other derivatives contracts are tailored for specific parties , like an interest rate swap , in which one party agrees to exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate with a second party for a specified period . Such private business contracts are traded over the counter and remain off banks ' balance sheets . It is this second type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading is conducted behind closed doors and largely unregulated . <p> Derivatives of both types have grown , though they are measured in different ways , making direct comparisons difficult . For the contracts not traded on an exchange , the prime measure is notional value , or the amount of the underlying asset on which they are based . About $37 trillion in such contracts are now out , up from $865 billion in 1987 , according to the International Swap and Derivatives Association . <p> As this market has grown , so has concern about whether banks , brokerage firms and derivatives dealers could be brought down by a market mishap , a big bet turned sour or a rogue trader at another institution . In 1993 , the House Banking Committee issued a 900-page report on the derivatives market , which one Congressman called the " new wild card in international finance , " presaging the jitters over Orange County , Barings and Long-Term Capital . <p> The General Accounting Office released a study the next year that identified a number of risks to the system and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms . Partly because of Mr. Levitt 's prodding , the Wall Street firms agreed to train their top managers and board members on derivative risks , enhance their reporting to the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. , take derivatives into account when setting aside capital , and follow certain guidelines when dealing with people who are not finance professionals . For Regulation More Information Helps Everyone <p> A drumbeat for greater disclosure is now being sounded by prominent Wall Street figures and hedge fund managers such as George Soros ; Julian H. Robertson Jr . of Tiger Management ; Citigroup 's chairman , Sanford I. Weill , and the Goldman , Sachs co-chairman , Jon Corzine . <p> Regulators and the financial markets could , the thinking goes , operate much better with more information . Bank regulators already have access to information about derivatives risk ; in fact , they often set up shop inside big banks . Brokerage firms voluntarily provide quarterly reports on the risks associated with derivatives . <p> The question remains , though , whether regulators receive information on a timely basis and whether they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a year to the futures commission . <p> Brooksley E. Born , the chairwoman of the commission , says that secrecy in the derivatives market is worrisome . " There has been a great deal of concern internationally about the lack of transparency , " she said in an interview . " I share that concern . " <p> Creating a more open market , however , is fraught with difficulty . The value of derivatives contracts changes rapidly , making information out of date as soon as it is gathered . And what exactly would derivatives dealers and hedge funds disclose , since others could use that information for market gains , and whom would they disclose it to ? Regulators ? Investors ? Creditors ? <p> Another possibility is to restrict how much regulated financial institutions can lend or require hedge funds to put up more collateral , in effect putting a brake on easy lending , which some industry officials argue is the crux of the matter . " What was wrong with Long-Term Capital was n't derivatives , it was borrowing , " said Thomas Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Morgan . " This is all about leverage . " <p> Long-Term Capital had borrowed assets equal to 25 times its capital at the end of last year , making it look more like a securities firm than the typical hedge fund . As Long-Term Capital coughed up additional money to satisfy its lending agreements , its borrowed assets rose to 100 times its dwindling capital . <p> But Representative James Leach , Republican of Iowa , and others suggest that new rules may be needed to protect against a national banking crisis since hedge funds are often supported by federally insured banks . " It would be imprudent and anti-intellectual not to seriously review the derivatives and hedge fund industries , " Mr. Leach , chairman of the House Banking Committee , said in an interview . <p> Critics of such proposals say that Government interference would only impede business . " The problem in the derivatives market is that it 's hard to figure out what something 's worth , " said Michael Segal , president of Lamborn Securities , a derivatives dealer in New York . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put restrictions on leverage . This is not the place for government . " <p> A third proposal is the use of a private clearinghouse to settle the many derivatives trades that are not now handled on any exchange . The change would be much like that in the market for small stocks , which once traded over the counter before Nasdaq came along to standardize trading . <p> A clearinghouse , for a fee , would match trades and guarantee that all transactions are honored , even if one party goes bankrupt before making good on its contract . It could also be used to impose controls on borrowing . The clearinghouse proposal has received a great deal of attention and was recommended by the Bank for International Settlements , which coordinates global banking rules . <p> " It 's been talked about for a long time , " said Leslie Rahl , a principal with Capital Markets Risk Advisers , a New York consulting firm specializing in derivatives . But the idea " has n't gone anywhere because of dealer resistance  --  the costs and the complexities in agreeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether a clearinghouse could stave off huge losses amid severe market turmoil is hard to determine . " A domino effect will bring down a clearing operation , too , " said Franklin R. Edwards , a professor of economics and finance at Columbia University . Against Regulation Financial Costs Of Adding Rules <p> Yet for all the proposals being forwarded , many regulators and financial experts worry that creating more regulatory hurdles could disrupt or stifle a vibrant and vital marketplace . <p> " It 's very easy to call for regulation , but one needs to assess whether it 's going to do any good , " said Susan Phillips , dean of the school of business and management at George Washington University and until recently a member of the Federal Reserve Board . " Every time someone talks about a new regulatory scheme it adds costs . " <p> Ms. Phillips and a host of regulators have long opposed tighter controls on derivatives that are traded over the counter . Many of them , including the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , believe that the market can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aside from safety and soundness regulation of derivatives dealers under the banking or securities laws , regulation of derivatives transactions that are privately negotiated by professionals is unnecessary , " Alan Greenspan , the Fed chairman , told the House Banking Committee this summer before the Long-Term Capital rescue . <p> For their part , the banks argue that their examiners already scrutinize derivatives activity . <p> " Every swap contract at every bank is regulated , " said Mark C. Brickell , a board member of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and a managing director at J. P. Morgan . <p> That leads some industry observers to conclude that it was not the absence of controls but a regulatory failure that brought Long-Term Capital to the brink and threatened its business partners . <p> " It comes down to , do you think the regulation of banks is sufficient ? " said Professor Edwards of Columbia University . " If the links in the chain are strong , the chain wo n't break . But the fact is , it 's very difficult for regulators to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too opaque and too fast moving . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : December 16 , 1998 , Wednesday <p> CORRECTION : An article in Business Day yesterday about the outlook for tighter market regulation after the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management misidentified the employer of Thomas Clark , a managing director in derivative securities who attributed Long-Term 's problem to its heavy borrowing . Mr. Clark works for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &; Company , not for J. P. Morgan . <p> " Some Painful Lessons " Derivatives contracts allow investors and speculators to make big bets with a relatively small amount of money , creating the possibility of big losses when markets turn against them .
