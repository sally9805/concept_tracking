<p> KISSIMMEE , Fla. - John Hudek is the only man in baseball who wears one of his ribs around his neck . <p> " " I plan on wearing it the whole season , " Hudek said . " " I think it will be a constant reminder that it could have ended my career , but it did n't . " The hard-throwing closer never will forget the day last June when he met with Astros management and the team doctors to hear news he never imagined was possible . <p> " " They told me my 1995 season was over , " Hudek , 29 , said . " " I needed a major surgery to remove a rib . I could n't believe it . <p> It was such a shock that it took several days to get over it . <p> I was scared that my baseball career was over . " The sad thing was that the best part of his career had just begun . It took Hudek six years to get a chance to pitch in the major leagues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste it . <p> Hudek made the National League All-Star team in 1994 when he saved 16 games , finishing with a 2.97 ERA while striking out 39 hitters in 39 innings . <p> The righthander appeared to be on his way to another All-Star appearance in 1995 . In his first nine appearances , he was almost unhittable , striking out 19 in 10 innings and allowing only three hits and no runs . <p> At the beginning of June , he had six saves in six attempts and an 0.75 ERA . <p> But that 's when things started to change . <p> " " It was a game against Atlanta ( June 3 ) when I noticed something was n't right , " Hudek said . " " At that point I felt myself getting tired , but I thought it was just a dead arm . I thought it would go away in a few days . <p> " " I did n't notice the discoloration or the swelling then because I did n't even think about it . " <p> The problems worsened . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit hard every time he took the mound . And his arm would swell and turn an odd color after he pitched . <p> " " The discoloration in my arm would last for over an hour after I pitched , and it kept getting worse , " Hudek said . " " I had tests done and they showed there was no problem with my shoulder or elbow . There were no bone chips , no muscle tears or anything . " <p> So Hudek continued to pitch , hoping the mysterious problem would go away . On June 22 in a game against the Cubs , Hudek allowed three hits and three runs . He left the field that night knowing something was seriously wrong . <p> " " Guys looked at me in the clubhouse and said . ' Your arm is turning purple ! ' When Dr. ( Bill ) Bryan saw the discoloration , he realized the problem had to be vascular . " <p> A test known as a venogram , where dye is injected into the arm , revealed that one of Hudek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever he pitched . <p> " " Later that day they called me in for a meeting , " Hudek said . <p> " " They said I had to have surgery , and the surgery was to remove the No. 1 rib . I said , ' What do you mean ? Ca n't we do something so I can finish the season ? ' The doctors said no . The surgery had to be done and it could n't wait . <p> " " There were times when I said to myself , ' Why did this have to happen now . ' I was an All-Star the year before and my ERA was below 1.00 in 1995 when I started to feel that something was wrong . It just did n't seem fair . " <p> Hudek spent some depressing days before and after the surgery , which was performed by Dr. David Roos of Denver . But one call helped change Hudek 's perspective . <p> " " A former major-league pitcher named Bill Singer contacted the Astros and told them to have me give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me he had the same surgery and pitched six years in the big leagues afterward without any loss in his velocity . <p> " " I was really pleased because he put me at ease . As far as coming back , he said the only obstacle I would have would be in my head . " <p> The amazing thing about the Singer story is that he had the rib-removal surgery in 1966 . Six of his eight seasons for the Los Angeles Dodgers came after the surgery . <p> That news was the kind of positive reinforcement Hudek needed . <p> " " After that , I did n't see anything holding me back , " Hudek said . " " I knew I would be able to go out there and challenge hitters the way I always have . " <p> Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker and manager Terry Collins have put their full support behind Hudek , believing he can return to his All-Star form . They did n't see anything in the first day of spring workouts Thursday to make them think differently . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to go in there and close a game , " Hunsicker said . " " He 's probably about 80 percent , which is better than a lot of other pitchers right now . If anything , he is ahead of schedule . " Doctors have placed no limitations on what Hudek can do this spring . His only timetable is how he feels . <p> " " I 'm just like everybody else out here , " Hudek said . " " If something starts to bother me that is out of the ordinary , we will cut back a little bit . Today it felt real good to throw outside . I admit I was jumping a little bit , but everything felt real smooth . " <p> Collins just wants to make sure Hudek does n't try to do too much too fast . <p> " " John looked good and loose out there today and had some pop on the ball , " Collins said . " " It came out of his hand good and he had good arm speed . Those are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is on March 15 , then make a judgment if he 's ready on April 1 <p> " " What I do n't want to see is him throwing 84 ( mph ) March 1 and 82 on April 1 . I want him to take it slow and not rush it . <p> John has to realize it 's going to take time and not worry about if the first time out things do n't go the way he wants them to go . <p> " " We 'll see how it works . I do n't think you can go to any doctor and have him say John will be back 100 percent . No one knows that for sure , but there 's no reason to think he wo n't be ready . " <p> But it is a gamble for the Astros to assume Hudek will be the same pitcher April 1 , 1996 , that he was April 1 , 1995 . <p> " " His arm is sound and always was sound , " Hunsicker said . <p> " " Since the surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine , it seemed like a very minimal risk to me . There should be absolutely no effect on his velocity . It is n't like he had rotator-cuff surgery . " What if the worst possible scenario developed and Hudek was not ready to pitch at the start of the season ? <p> " " I still do n't feel it 's a big risk because Todd Jones is very capable of assuming that role if John is not ready , " Hunsicker said . " " But we have every reason to believe John will be ready . " <p> Hudek spent the past month throwing at the Astrodome with pitchers Doug Brocail and Shane Reynolds . They took turns catching for each other . <p> " " Do n't let Hudy fool you , " Brocail said . " " I caught him and I guarantee you he was throwing over 90 sometimes because I was scared he was going to kill me . " <p> Hudek laughed at Brocail 's assessment , but admits he is pleased at how well he 's throwing . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how fast I 'm throwing , " Hudek said . " " I could have been throwing the ball over 90 today . The coaches were telling me to take it a little bit easier . I know my ball has movement on it , and that 's what I want . " <p> Hudek has made a vow to himself , which he shared with Collins and the coaches . <p> " " I 've told them that I will not sit in that dugout and watch another game without being able to contribute , " Hudek said . " " That 's why I 'm going at it hard now , so I know I 'll be ready . " <p> And when he takes the hill for the first time , he will have his personal reminder of the ordeal he has been through - that shiny bone on his necklace . <p> " " I asked the doctor if I could keep it , " Hudek said of his infamous rib . " " I drilled a hole in it and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little different , and I guess by wearing this I 'm living up to that . But I have my reasons . <p> It 's my way of showing it did n't stop me .
