THE SALES PITCH WAS DAZZLING , THE promises irresistible . Dilapidated school buildings would be renovated , and fancy computer labs installed . Class size would go down , and test scores up . Less money would be spent on the bureaucracy , and more where it counted : on the students . And Hartford 's public schools would maybe slowly raise themselves out of the gutter of the Connecticut school system . All this , and more , was hoped for last year when Education Alternatives , Inc. landed a five-year contract to run Hartford 's entire 32-school district and its $200 million budget . <P> A few years ago , the concept of privatization  --  in which a for-profit company takes over the management of some , or all , school functions  --  seemed like it might be a magic bullet for the nation 's ailing , bureaucratically entrenched public schools . Now it appears that the champions of privatization may have seriously underestimated the challenges  --  political , organizational and financial  --  of such radical change . Christopher Whittle 's highly touted Edison Project has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , based in Bloomington , Minnesota , has signed no new clients in more than a year . Its contract to manage an elementary school in Miami Beach , Florida , expired last June ; its nine-school project in Baltimore , Maryland , remains controversial , and its high-stakes deal in Hartford , the largest privatization experiment in the nation , is on the verge of collapse . <P> In fact , the problems in Hartford could cripple EAI . Because the company agreed to assume all costs of reform up front in return for one half of every dollar it saved the school district , EAI is now out about $10 million , and the company 's stock , which has fallen to $7.50 from a historic high of $48.75 in 1993 , reflects that loss . EAI 's chief operating officer , William Goins , stepped down last week , claiming differences in " leadership styles . " Meanwhile , the Hartford Board of Education , which has already wrested back control of 26 out of 32 schools , is so unhappy with the company 's performance that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists that because there have been no savings , there will be no reimbursement of expenses . Unless EAI supporters win three out of the five open seats in this week 's school-board election , the company 's contract will probably be terminated altogether . Still , EAI chairman and CEO John Golle downplays the trouble . " The press is making this out as Waterloo , " he says . " I do n't think so at all . School reform is a freight train moving down the track . "
