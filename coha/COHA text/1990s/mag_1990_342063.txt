When Keith , 31 , first raised the issue of a prenuptial agreement with his fiancee Sarah , 32 , she balked . For a month the Manhattan stockbroker danced around the subject , then he pressed hard . " I said if we do n't sign a prenuptial , we ca n't get married , " he recalls . Finally Sarah , an advertising executive , consented , and each hired a lawyer . Keith 's attorney drafted the first version , largely to protect money the groom expects to inherit from his family , and Sarah " flipped out , " says Keith . " She was almost in tears . " It took months before the couple hammered out an agreement that allowed them to keep their appointment at the altar . <P> Before they say " I do , " more and more American couples are following the same pattern : negotiating premarital contracts that spell out what they will and wo n't do , or share , or pay . Publicized and popularized by the rich and famous  --  most loudly of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are increasingly in vogue among the middle and upwardly mobile classes . Such contracts are recognized in all 50 states , and matrimonial lawyers report that they are preparing two to five times as many as they did just five years ago , particularly among couples who make $50,000 and up . Many of the agreements not only spell out a division of financial assets if a marriage fails or a spouse dies , but also enumerate " life-style clauses , " sometimes bizarre in their obsessive fine-tuning , that provide a blueprint for a marriage before it has begun . <P> Many people say prenuptial agreements are unromantic .

Men and women over age 30 account for 41% and 32% , respectively , of all new marriages . People coming later to marriage usually have more substantial assets in tow . Moreover , in 45% of all new marriages , one or both partners have been married before . Thus many people have property they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gail Koff , a founding partner of the law firm Jacoby &; Meyers : " These couples understand that marriage is a business proposition . " <P> But business alone does not a marriage agreement make . The lingering sour taste of a failed previous marriage prompts many couples to try to anticipate all the obstacles ahead on the next try . Couples in interfaith marriages often predetermine the religious upbringing of their prospective children . Two- income couples spell out the conditions under which they will relocate for a spouse 's career . For every sublime consideration , there is a matching ridiculousness . One New York City couple were so determined to divide expenses equally that their contract stipulated that they would split the $3 toll when crossing the George Washington Bridge . Another couple itemized the ownership of 207 items , down to a $1.98 vase given to the prospective bride by her grandmother .
