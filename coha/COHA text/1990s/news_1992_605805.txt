<p> Two weeks ago , a man with a long-barreled gun robbed Mike Wargo of his car and his sense of safety  --  in his own front yard . <p> Wargo had just parked his 1986 BMW outside his town house in Alexandria 's Old Town and was starting to get out when he heard someone in the darkness demand his car keys . Thinking it must be a joke , he turned toward the voice and saw two hands holding either a shotgun or a rifle . <p> " My whole idea of what I consider secure has kind of been blown , " said Wargo , 40 , a fund-raising executive . " I do n't normally think of car thieves as carrying weapons . It 's very scary . For me , the wrong place at the wrong time was in front of my house . " <p> Armed auto thefts , sometimes called " carjackings , " are an emerging crime in the Washington area and another example , police say , of how brazen and violent criminals have become . <p> Unlike car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from motorists by force , often using the cars as a means of escape after robbing the motorists of other valuables , or using them to commit other crimes . <p> According to police , carjackers will approach motorists at red lights or stop signs , stage minor traffic crashes to lure them out of their vehicles , stake out shopping mall parking lots or see a car they want and follow it home . <p> " This is an entirely new breed of dog , " said R.V. Crow , assistant special agent in charge of the Virginia Auto Theft Unit , which includes state police and Department of Motor Vehicle investigators . " This is a whole lot easier to do . The thief can merely wait at a stoplight until he sees a car he likes and stick a gun in their face . " <p> " This is the type of crime which seems to have been on the increase over the past several years , " said Warren Carmichael , Fairfax County 's police spokesman . " There 's more widespread use of firearms and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Police , citing a growing problem in the state , recently began warning motorists about the crime . But because most police departments in the Washington area , including the District , do not generally categorize types of robberies , they ca n't say yet how often it happens . Police departments lump carjackings into general categories , such as robbery , grand larceny or auto theft , Crow said . <p> The phenomenon has become a big problem in other cities , such as Detroit and New York , where police say many stolen luxury cars are showing up for sale in Third World countries . The police departments here that are seeing more such cases say that most of the cars are recovered quickly . <p> Prince George 's County police track the crime , and records show that 168 people were robbed of their vehicles during the first six months of last year , police said . Maryland State Police said they are not aware of any cases , and Montgomery County police say they have seen few . <p> Arlington County police said they have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed an increase  --  about six robberies  --  since August . <p> Fairfax County police also have begun seeing more incidents in the last few years , including two last weekend : one involving a Clifton man returning to his 1987 Nissan 300ZX after dropping off a tape at a Blockbuster Video store , the other involving a couple sitting in their 1989 Toyota Supra behind the Days Inn in Herndon . <p> Alexandria has had two armed car robberies so far this year : Wargo 's black BMW on Jan. 4 and a 1987 Chevrolet Nova taken from a 27-year-old woman in the heart of Old Town on Jan. 3 , in the middle of the day . <p> The Alexandria woman was heading east on King Street about noon when a vehicle struck her car from behind near Washington Street , said Officer Mark Bergin , an Alexandria police spokesman . When she got out to inspect the damage , two of the three males in the other car jumped into her vehicle and drove off , he said . <p> Seven days later , several males in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 Mazda sitting at a stop sign on Wesmond Drive , Bergin said . The woman tried to drive away , but one of the suspects was able to stay with the car as she pulled into a cul-de-sac . The suspect struck her on the head , but by then , witnesses had called police , who arrested two males ages 20 and 17 . <p> After reviewing police files , Bergin counted 14 armed car robberies in Alexandria last year , including those of drivers who had picked up hitchhikers , men and women in their driveways and workers parking their cars in office lots . Robbers took all types of vehicles : Corvettes , Mercedes-Benzes , beat-up work vans , compacts , even a 1991 Toyota 4-Runner at gunpoint during a test drive . <p> The carjackings are " across the board , and they 're all over the city , " Bergin said . <p> Authorities offer numerous theories as to why carjackings  --  which apparently got their start and their name in Detroit  --  seem to be on the rise . Some investigators believe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars when the owners are n't in them . Others say people who leave keys and valuables in their cars when they pump gas provide a temptation to criminals . A major factor , according to police , is the proliferation of guns and violence . <p> Criminals are taking more chances , said Detective Daniel Straub , an investigator with the District 's Auto Squad . " People really need to be careful . You do n't want them to be paranoid , but they need to be on their guard , " he said . <p> In Detroit , where the number of carjackings is decreasing after 74 in just one week in August , two people have been shot to death while trying to resist , according to Detroit police . <p> Prince George 's and D.C. police said that in many cases , the car theft is secondary in the crime . " The feeling seems to be that 's their getaway car , " said Sgt. Chuck Cooke , a spokesman for the Prince George 's police department . Many cars are recovered days , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One 36-year-old woman , an interior designer in Fairfax , got her Mercedes back two days after it was stolen at gunpoint in a parking lot at Tysons Corner Center in 1989 . The woman , who did not want to be identified , said she sensed something was wrong when she walked out of Nordstrom and saw a car with four males and temporary tags . <p> But she ignored her instincts , she said , and tossed her package in the back seat . While she had her back turned , one of the males approached , grabbed her arm and told her not to move or he would shoot her . <p> " I could see something black with a hole in it between my collar and my neck , " the woman said . " I was pretty sure it was a gun . " <p> The woman did as she was told : She put her purse inside the car , handed over her keys and walked away slowly without screaming . Her car , with shattered windows and dents on the sides , was recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is even more careful now and wo n't walk to her car in a parking lot unless there are other people around . <p> A Fairfax doctor and his wife , who were robbed of their Nissan Maxima at Tysons in 1989 , said they were parking their car in Terrace B near Bloomingdale 's in the early afternoon when a man with a gun demanded their car . <p> " I looked at the guy , and I was ready to kill him , " said the doctor , who also did not want to be identified . But realizing even a brown belt in karate was no match for a gun , he handed over his keys . The couple got their badly damaged car back eight days later ; it also had been found in Southeast Washington . <p> " It looked like it had been squeezed down a narrow street , " the doctor said . " It 's really a disgusting commentary on what this society is coming to . " <p> Virginia State Police are warning shoppers across the state to park as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit parking areas . They encourage motorists involved in a minor crash to drive to well-lit and populated areas . <p> The man who robbed Wargo of his BMW in Old Town " came out of nowhere , " Wargo said . <p> " If it happened in Washington , then I could say , ' Well , it happens in Washington , ' " Wargo said . " But this happened in front of my house . I ca n't say , ' Well , I 'm not going to my town house anymore . ' " <p> Staff writer Nancy Lewis contributed to this report .
