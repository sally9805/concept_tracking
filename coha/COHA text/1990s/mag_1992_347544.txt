THE PLANET MERCURY IS TRULY A HELLISH PLACE : IT is one-third as far from the sun as Earth , and its daytime temperatures can reach 430 degreesC ( 800 degreesF ) . The last thing scientists expected to find there was ice . But that is just what a new radar study of Mercury , reported in Science , has detected . Planetary scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab and at Caltech aimed powerful radar beams at both of the planet 's poles ; the return signals bore the telltale signs of having bounced off a frozen surface . Like Earth and Mars , Mercury appears to have polar ice caps . <P> How is it possible ? An analysis by UCLA scientists points out that while the poles are bathed in scorching sunlight , the light hits at such a shallow angle that the floors of some craters are permanently in shadow . With no atmosphere to move heat around , the temperature in these spots is far below zero . Any ice that condensed as frost in the craters billions of years ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still be around today  --  and evidently is.
