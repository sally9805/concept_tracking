School was a place they sent me eight-thirty to three-ten weekdays . Being . there , I learned about matters like civics , syntax , physics , and rule-of-one . Though I never tried . I saw the lessons as periods of busywork-like filling a hole on the beach with sea water . The only sensible point of my effort was stopping prompt at three-ten . When , with the enthusiasm of the fresh-released , I joined the rest of the boys , and went to play . <p> At about thirteen in years and vast in innocence , there are many opponents to serious playing . The biggest scamp is time . It Joins sides with parents to give play hours a special slippery speed . Like balls of soap in a waterfall , they are gone before you can use them well . Three-thirty gets to six o'clock almost immediately , and always before the end of the game . <p> Other rascals are more natural , although quite formidable . Some are the small brained , bigger boys who bully you away , unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the under side , there are the little boys , who , like incomplete ideas in knee-pants , persist only as stubbing blocks to your style , reminding of yourself not long ago . <p> Then we misfits discovered a play-place that was perfect . An empty plot , free of every traitor but speeding time . Since we could n't fight him , content as colonists , we settled down there to accommodate his wiles . Then , second day , after soccer teams were picked , fields declared , and coin tossed , we found out there was a watchman in paradise . <p> So , at innocent thirteen , we learned to savor the simple satisfaction of damming persecutors : The hard-barked cross which brought us torment being the Corbeau-man . Mr. Angos , that is . <p> Mr. Angos put in so much effort at watching the place you 'd have thought he was twins . Worse was that he did this for no other reason than to frustrate us . A supreme people-hater and only happy when spoiling , this man crashed funerals just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got the nick-name Corbeau-man-from the way he was always gliding in and hovering eager-eyed around the deceased . His high , upslanting shoulder-blades did n't make the title hard to stick . <p> Naturally , nobody in the school liked him ; not even the boy scouts . When they practiced their door-to-door racket selling overpriced calories , whosoever got stuck with going to the Corbeau-man 's rickety shanty would make a personal donation , rather than the visit . Such charity was pain , but compared in heart-cost , far less than facing those hatchet eyes of the Stingiest One . <p> The landowner , one Mr. Devetin , had left him in control of the estate before emigrating to the Cold . With the bossman up North , Mr. Angos was so much in charge , that soon he was behaving as if he had birthright . My Pops explanation was that , like El Senor Cristobal Columbus , the meager watchman had freshly discovered " Authority . " For a while , I thought authority was something that made people nosy , mean-spirited , and old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taskmaster . He walked around those twenty acres at least twice a day . And that was plainly pointless : the land being basically flat as a bare page . So anybody with eyesight could stand at any point of the plot and look over the complete place . And that anybody would 've found nothing much to see . <p> Not Mr. Angos . He used to slide around the hardstone earth gazing over it as though it was a garden of wishes . <p> The property was shaped like an envelope with the nap open . It was mainly pebble-covered , beige dirt . In some areas , fine paragrass tried to green over the bareness . It was n't winning . There were scant copses of taller trees about the land . Two of them formed sketchy fringes at opposite ends of the flap . The biggest copse , in the postage stamp corner , was about the size of a house lot . Smaller children liked playing wilderness games there , until their mothers caught and toddled them off . <p> Right in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone must 've put Obeah or maljeaux on them . They never thrived . Each year they bore among them , about two dozen forced-ripe fruit . The mangoes were thick-skinned on the outside and stringy in the pulp . They had no taste but sour , and dropped unwanted to shrivel on the earth , rejected even by the worms that make things rot . As a whole , there was this hardness about the place . It was mulish land , stubborn in nature , and barren . <p> What lent the field life was the boys . Each day after school , if you wanted to find a boy who played , you found him there . For as a sportsfield , here was space for any and every game desired . And if it was n't going on , there was room to start it up . Always . Sometimes , soccer , hide-and-seek , marbles , kite flying , and foot racing would be going on all at once , each in its different part . And that 's still not counting other solo games like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , armed with slingshots , slinking after nesting birds . Yes , the place was a honey spot to any active boy . The only sting to the sweetness was Mr. Angos . <p> He made it impossible for anyone to relax into total play . Throughout every game , you had to be on the lookout for the Corbeau-man . You might be keeping goal and following the run of the game on the field . But , as if you stole for a living , you had to be constantly glancing behind . We had learned that looking for the hill-shouldered spoiler was a basic part of the games played there . A person could always identify the teams that practiced on our field : ever jittery , they were . <p> Mr. Angos walked his beat with a cane and a bulldog . He called the animal Brutus . Passing by his house , stop and listen , you often heard him shouting , " Sit ! Jump ! Dammit , you jackass ! When I say ' Jump , ' JUMP ! " Then would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog 's howl or two later , the Corbeau-man would voice again , " Come here now , and SIT ! " <p> In the outside world , though , during his watchmanning , Mr. Angos never said a word to the dog . We knew why . Brutus , like all of us boys , had learned to read Mr. Angos ' patrolling mind . And dog he , too , knew the simple command tolling within the Corbeau-head : " Eat any meat we find in we land ! " it was . <p> An incident proving Brutus to be canny sort of gave the playing-ground the name , Battlefield : Mr. Angos ' idea of watchmanning was to check if the land boundaries had moved from morning to night by religiously patrolling the perimeter . As far as play was concerned , this was convenient for everyone , since somebody always saw their march approaching , and we 'd time-out and clear the field before he and Brutus came near enough to be danger . <p> Everybody 'd run and stand up at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two , three feet outside a slight path the regular patrolling had ground out . The Corbeau-man would walk by watching his responsibility , ignoring us as if we were ghosts . In turn , we 'd watch him like a small crowd on a kerb silently watching a funeral pass . <p> At completely snubbing our presence , the Corbeau-man was like a thick stonewall . Sometimes , he 'd pass by cursing us as if talking to himself , looking straight ahead . He 'd spit the words out in his rasp-hoarse voice , saying the most disgusting things about us and our kinfolk , as if we were deaf . We marveled at how he strung obscenities together as he spiced our ears with spectacular vulgarity . While he spewed , he 'd stride by , striking his cane against his high boots . And we did nothing at all , but stand quietly , and listen to this master of Hate . <p> Later on in the evenings , as we raced the darkness home , we 'd try to remember his prurient creations . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog Brutus , an evil pug-ugly , followed a little behind his monster . He was a powerful-looking bulldog taken to a rolling bandy-legged , bully 's gait , as if he lifted weights every morning . His maw was always dripping white saliva . He never wagged his stubby tail . To us he was hardly a real dog , just the epitome of foe . <p> This particular time , some of the boys were having a footrace competition . All were fleet , but our homeboy , Brandon Bohane , reigned as speedking . They had just finished a quartermile sprint , when someone spotted Hatchet Blades and Brutus on their rounds , approaching . In the sudden activity that followed , one of the racers caught a cramp , and found getting up so painful , he chose to lay flat on the ground until the Ill Wind passed by . Brandon decided to keep courage with him . Everyone else scooted off to line up at the edge . <p> Brandon and Muscle Cramp laid down like corpses . The rest of us crowded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brutus came on . This was n't a cussword patrol . Instead , he was using his cane as a golf club to swing at stones , hitting them from his path onto the property . Every time he struck one , it whisked away into the field as if from a whipping , bounced around a few uncertain times before settling down as far away as it could from Mr. Angos . <p> As he passed , as usual treating us like clouds , he seemed also to ignore the two fellows on his side of the land . One of the stones he energized went to rest quite near Muscle Cramp . And although you could n't even trust coincidence around the man , it did n't seem a deliberate try . Vulture Shoulders seemed about to pass on swingingly . <p> But then , just as he went by the last of our group , he halted . Everybody had been so happily watching him go away , that his stop came like a belch during a smooth refreshing draught : contrary , choking off relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His brief tail curved and rearing like a scorpion sting , Brutus charged over the graveled earth , skimming the ground , aiming straight for Muscle Cramp . We could almost feel his grinning white fangs tearing flesh . But Muscle Cramp had seen , and was n't being idly frightened . Scrambling around still flattened Brandon , using him for fence , he began a horrible screaming . <p> For Brutus was on the scene , and flinging vicious teeth . <p> Brandon upsed up , grabbed his spikes and started swinging back at the snarling dog  --  missing even the breeze he made . Missing wildly because he was terrified , though too , the dog was attacking like a good boxer . <p> Could n't stop the admiration as Brutus darted and braked , then feinted and snapped , his ferocious growling effective defense-piercing weapon by itself . And in no time , his many-pronged attack had drawn blood once from Brandon , plus a probable from Muscle Cramp . <p> Once blood started flowing the excitement changed . We now expected Mr. Angos to call off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , we found the Corbeau-man not even watching the fight , instead gazing at distance as though searching for hills . <p> Brutus had not bitten them , though . All watching close , we saw the blood to be from claw scratches . Still , any bleeding at all was serious , and as watchman , Mr. Angos had made his point , and should have stopped it . For plainly Brutus was over-indulging at his pursuit of live meat . <p> As for Brandon , despite Muscle Cramp 's terror tying him up with clinging arms and legs , he was trying best to defend . In his hysterical scrambling , twice now Muscle Cramp had tripped his hero to the ground , and he seemed growing still more frantic with every lunge from Brutus . So poor Brandon , armed with only one running shoe , was fighting for basic balance , self-respect , and skin . <p> Then a spike caught Brutus on the snout and caused a complete change in his tactics ; first move being a leap back to safe distance . Then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For though he still snarled furious threats at the boys , a hint of yelp now whined through his bark . And , as red drops sprouted from Brutus ' snout , Brandon grew aggressive . More to it , Muscle Cramp had released his legs , allowing advance towards the brute , so Brandon went in swinging the spiked shoe , it spinning like half a windmill in a storm . Did n't even need to aim . He was bound to hit something . <p> Right then came the only time the Corbeau-man played savior . Just grunted , stepped on . And that was all the hint Brutus needed . Tail close to the ground , he made at swaggering off . But his trot carried too much scamper and , as he went , his crouch smacked of the belly-crawl of the whipped . <p> We held our cheers until they were safe away , then rushed in to help Brandon brag about his victory . Not long afterwards , everyone was calling the place " Battlefield . " <p> The war between Mr. Angos and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We provoked nary a one . For although he had lost that one battle , we always respected Brutus ' might , and much , much more , the constant meanness of his master . So our defensive strategy towards them remained simple . We set lookouts . When they hoved into view , we took to the lines and assessed their patrol 's progress . At their every approach , we cleaned from the field , returning only when they were well gone . Sometimes , as they passed , his obscene poetry would leave its ugly threat hovering in the quiet of our consternation . Then , we 'd place new scouts and resume play . Occasionally , some solo fool 'd be negligent , and learn a brisk course in escaping bulldog 's fangs . But otherwise , as far as the war on Battlefield went , we managed to play within it . <p> Then the nastiness began . One Monday in school , some fellows came back from lunch break spreading a story : there was a gang of workmen putting up a fence around Battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded , because of another fantastic one which was unearthed as support . Someone had overheard a parent to say that , from way up in the Cold , Mr. Devetin had sold the land . Mr. Angos had lost his job . <p> With this sort of news in the air firing up people , the three o'clock bell was starter of a sprint to Battlefield . And in two twos , the playground had one of its largest audiences ever . It was a quiet crowd , though . The fence story was true . <p> The workmen left at four o'clock . There was a general hope that they 'd take their fence with them . But they did n't . They left Battlefield half enclosed by wire . For the first few minutes after , nobody disturbed the silence , or even moved much . Then we sort of drifted out of the shock . Several boys climbed up and over the standing chainlink boundary . Others experimented at loosening the metal poles from their concrete bases . Here and there , one or two guys peed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played . Some tried at catching a tennis ball . One fellow 'd throw the ball hard up to the sky . Others would run around under it , tracking for the catch . But most times they missed . The throwers were pelting too hard . The ball went up so far , the wind caught it and moved it around too much . They 'd have needed fishnets to catch anything . The main fact was that nobody really felt like playing . Fences were unfair tactics in the war of Battlefield . <p> We became so occupied with the fences besieging our playground , that we hardly noticed the Corbeau-man not being around anymore . He seemed to have disappeared ; perhaps from the sight of his hard-rock Battlefield yielding to tractors ' mechanical bites . <p> We , as usual , went to Battlefield every day after school . We lined the fence and watched the ending hour of each day 's work . Watched them repack surveying instruments , lines , chalk . Solemnly we studied the craters and ditches they gouged into the stony ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we found another message printed on neat black and white signs , hanging near the top of the chain fence . They read : <p> " HELP WANTED : ENQUIRE WITHIN MAIN OFFICE . " <p> It was this reference to jobs which , for me , affirmed that Mr. Angos had indeed fresh-lost his authority . <p> They began building on Battlefield the month I graduated . That June , after the boys left school , most of us never came close again . All before , we kept together because we played together on Battlefield . After that vacation , hose who continued to play anything , did so in special places in gyms , on clubgrounds . And if you were n't involved with their special game , you did n't see them much . Many of the fellows found new activities : some to work , some to evening school , some went girl crazy . One or two sports fanatics continued to go and stare at the goings-on in Battlefield . A few of the boys just disappeared ; either moved away , or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enquire as to what kind of help they wanted in the office . <p> The family had been patiently awaiting this stage of my schooling . Their intention was that I assumed my elder brother 's place ; him feeling mannish enough to request they allow him his own way . Thus I was slotted for his position as income earner and example for the two youngers . All fine with me , as I nursed no other plans . <p> Still , my private self felt pinched as betrayer in applying for work at Battlefield . And I was n't the only one conscious of this guilt . The three mornings I practiced trial runs , I had noticed a few fellow skulkers around Battlefield . And although we never met and spoke on it , I 'm certain it was n't lack of desire for employment that gave them that shifty-eyed cast . <p> My reasons for switching were solid , though . One was a compelling curiosity about the nature of those who had so totally vanquished hardrock Battlefield . Another , of course , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent , I visited the main office . <p> A cheeky boy with a vaguely familiar face and a uncontrollable grin , led me through the personnel department . Looking about at all the desks and busy folks , I had a first surprise . With their happy smiles , working there must 've been pleasant . What relaxed me further was that the staff was of mostly local people , not the behind-the-scenes foreigners I had somehow supposed . <p> When I entered her room , the Personnel Lady was also local and nice . She joked about my nervousness , even discussed the season 's calypsos before coming around to business . <p> " So , Jaddy , what job did you have in mind ? " she asked . <p> She caught me there , since I had n't anticipated choice . I upsed , " Something with a future , Ma'am . " <p> She nodded agreeably , " And what 's your schooling like ? " she asked . <p> " Grade A 's , Ma'am . " I said , and feeling like a genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her , and waited for effect . <p> She gave it a brief lookover , a casual smile . No congratulations . No admiring glances . Suddenly , I could n't fathom her . The cursory glimpse had so contradicted her warm interest . I decided that either she remained unimpressed about me and my education , or her show of teeth and feeling was put up as a picket-fence . I got to musing that maybe she powered the smile with tiny batteries in her cheeks-flicking it on and off without the energy of personal feelings . Just then , she turned the paint-white flash up to me again . Putting the diploma with some other papers on her desk , she invited , " You want to wait outside a tad ? Jaddy . " <p> Worried now that maybe she 'd read my rude mind , with a polite " Yes , Ma'am . Thank you , Ma'am , " I raced her professional smile out the room . <p> There were three other people waiting outside : A lady in a red dress , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chair next to him was the only one unoccupied . I went over , sat . <p> I had been near the Corbeau-man many times before , although this was the first time we were stationary close . He did n't seem as big here in the waiting room , most likely job-seeking . Yet still , the very idea of him , here , fazed . I concentrated on ignoring his presence , tried to figure at what stage he was . <p> The grinning office factotum appeared at the door again . " Mr. Angos ... " he invited with bold cheeriness . Anyone would 've smiled back , at least in self defense . Not the Corbeau-man . He walked by the boy without looking at him . The man remained the rottenest , with less humour than a dung beetle . Though it was rousing to see his consistent form . <p> The red dress lady and Blemished had been summoned away to their business when Mr. Angos returned . He crossed the room to his chair in his normal averted fashion , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunched in the usual fierce upslant of a vulture . Instead , they sagged heavily downwards , as if his hands were newly made of lead . But for the feathers , right then the Corbeauman seemed more like a chicken with dropsy . <p> He was ranting to himself  --  although his customary harsh timbre was strangely dulled , sounding him plaintive , a grandfather-weak tone that did n't go with him . <p> " ... kiss mih ass concrete mountins . Huhnn , as if dey want to stone cover all a'nature , all de earth . Stifling de land wit ' concrete . Fillin ' she up . Dey want to cover she hard an ' perm'nent . Dey want she clean . Dem an ' dey blasted security department ! " he snapped this out like it was new obscenity , paused , went on , " ... huhn , dey want me gardin concrete earth . Smilin an ' crouchin in a kiss-mi-ass cubbyhole , doin dey ant-shit job . Well nnh-huhn , I ent no shitball on a concrete hill . I ent born from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mih own way . I does work open land . Naked land could soak my piss up . Land I could see far on . I ent no lookout for concrete walls . " <p> Steadfastly looking away , I listened hard trying to figure his gripe . Across the room there was a water cooler . It stood near the door , a little to the right of my view . Its inner coolness had condensed water from the humid air to form beads of different sized droplets on the fat , silvered faucet . Every now and then , two or three joined together , rolled jerkily down tracking like cold teardrops . Each time one fell , it hit the floor with a starburst splat . <p> The sound of Corbeau-man 's delivery changed . He was pausing a lot and heaving up deep breaths before continuing . I listened into his tones again . <p> " ... not me an ' dem , nnh-huhn . I ha'ta be hardcock dotish t'work in place like dis . I ha'ta be dog . Me ! " <p> Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to return my eyes to the water cooler . For Mr. Angos too , was weeping . Was looking straight ahead , but on my side of his face , his tears were rolling down , disappearing into the scrub of greying bristles at his chin . <p> And suddenly I could not take his sadness ; not his sorry sniveling , not the close-up of his shriveled chin , not his broken spirit . Intruder , peep , I felt , and shied smarting eyes from all his busted privacy . Then , within my embarrassed haze , I barely heard the office boy 's voice calling me , " Mr. Mausic . Hey you ! You sleeping , or what ! Is your turn . This way , please . " <p> It was the youth , made at last unsmiling by my inattention . And with great relief , I escaped and followed his cold directions . <p> On the way back to the main gate through Battlefield 's fence , my major feeling was anxiety that I would bounce up with Mr. Angos before I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had made it through and was free , that I remembered I did n't need to be watchful anymore . It was a fact . I was the one with official position now . <p> I took it from my pocket and re-ascertained this marvelous turn . Their envelope was spotlessly white . Its typescript , perfectly balanced in the middle , inscribed my name  --  Mr. Jaddy Mausic  --  the black print , to me , pure goldbraid . Already , I knew by heart every word written on the twice-folded sheet inside . <p> Basically , the letter said , I was in ! " They " were contractors building a college for the government . I had won a full-time spot as architect 's apprentice , and , because of my ace diploma , qualified for free part-time education as the job was completed . <p> Very carefully , I put my future back into my safest pocket , not creasing , not dirtying it at all . Then stewing sweetly , I started for home eager to recount triumph , reap glory . Still I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the muddy , schoolboys ' backtrack home . No sense risking a spoiler by meeting the watchman on the public roadway . Not now . <p>
