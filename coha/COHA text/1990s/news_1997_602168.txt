<p> It 's 1,577 miles from the doorstep of Amy Morgan 's Indianapolis home to the driveway of her mother 's house on the outskirts of Salt Lake City . <p> There are three kids , a cat and a husband to consider  --  all along for the annual family trip . She could make the voyage in four hours by plane , but instead she piles everyone into their 1992 Ford Taurus for the two-day , 27-hour journey . <p> " We like the drive , " Morgan says . " That 's part of the vacation , stopping , sightseeing . Who wants to be cramped shoulder to shoulder , eating airplane food ? " <p> Americans are traveling like never before , logging an unprecedented 800 billion miles a year on long-distance trips . But do n't try prying them from their cars . Even on trips up to 2,000 miles , the typical traveler would rather get behind the wheel than hop a plane . <p> That 's one of the findings to come from the government 's first comprehensive look at the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Transportation takes a snapshot of the country on the move and finds that America 's love affair with the car is still in bloom . <p> " As the suburbs and the population are growing , the nation is spreading out , " says sociologist Robert O'Neill , author of several commuting studies and the book Drive Time . " The trip to grandma 's is no longer over the river and through the woods . It 's in the next state . " <p> All forms of transportation have increased ridership from 20 years ago . Americans now take about 1 billion long-distance trips  - -  defined as 100 miles or more , one way  --  a year . That 's about twice the number they took in 1977 . <p> Researchers expected that . What surprised the study 's authors were the methods and motives behind the treks : Only 15.6% of travelers went by plane , and only 22.5% of the trips were business-related . <p> " When you think of travelers , you picture a bunch of men in suits filling up an airplane , " study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the case . " <p> Instead , more than 75% of the country 's long-distance trips are taken for vacations , to visit friends and relatives , and to attend to personal matters such as weddings and funerals . <p> And more than 80% of trips are taken in personal vehicles , confirming the country 's love affair with the car . Even on trips that covered between 500 to 999 miles , more than three-fourths of travelers drove . <p> " In nearly every report we 've seen comparing us to other countries , it shows that Americans drive more than anyone else , " Lapham says . <p> The Transportation Department 's findings could weigh heavily in next year 's congressional debate over how to spend billions of dollars on the nation 's transportation system . <p> Some officials argue that studies like this prove that the public  --  despite saying it wants to fund mass transit , deficit reduction plans and environmental programs  --  really wants to drive , drive , drive . That could argue for more money for highway construction , improvements and maintenance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own vehicles , " says Frank Moretti , spokesman for The Road Information Project , which does travel research for the insurance , construction and automotive industries . " But people are voting with their feet on the gas pedal . " <p> The study , the most comprehensive ever on why , where and how Americans travel , sampled 80,000 households in 1995 , asking them to document every trip over 100 miles . The last such survey , conducted in 1977 , sampled 20,000 households . <p> The results show that Americans traveled 827 billion miles in 1995 , enough distance for each person in the USA to go from Portland , Maine , to Portland , Oregon . The average American traveled more than 3,100 miles on long distance trips in 1995 , up from 1,800 miles in 1977 . <p> Americans also are blurring state lines . More than half the long-distance trips crossed into another state , while about a third of the trips were " bridge traffic , " meaning travelers passed through at least one state to get to a third . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foreign countries . Of those , about half were to Canada and Mexico , and most of the travelers lived in bordering states . About 18% of foreign trips ventured into Europe . <p> Men typically travel more often than women , while two-thirds of long-distance trips are taken by people between the ages of 25 and 64 . Nearly half of the trips were taken by someone who lived in a household making $ 50,000 or more , and 42% of travelers had a bachelor 's degree or higher . <p> Buses and trains remain essential modes of transportation , especially for minorities , the elderly and low-income travelers . About 54% of those who travel by bus earn less than $ 25,000 a year , 52% are minority and 24% are elderly . Trains have ridership that is 23% low-income , 32% minority and 14% elderly . <p> " Trains and buses are n't dead , " Lapham says . " They 've just been ignored . For a lot of people who get overlooked , it 's a vital form of transportation . " <p> Though more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still take long-distance trips twice as often as African-Americans and Hispanics . Lee Daniels , a spokesman for the National Urban League , blames the disparity on the lack of disposable income available to minorities . <p> Daniels says minorities rely on buses because they are inexpensive and because the populations often are concentrated in large cities  --  places where residents often do n't own cars . <p> In addition , Daniels says , many African-Americans and Hispanics think their cars are not " highway-worthy . " <p> " They do n't want to drive because they fear their cars will break down on the highway , " Daniels says . " They have a feeling that their cars ca n't sustain a 400-mile trip . " <p> The study did n't specifically address economic factors that go into making travel choices , but many travelers like the freedom and sense of control that driving affords . <p> " If you drive , you are guaranteed to get there , " says C. Van Tune , editor of Motor Trend magazine , who drives on any trip up to 500 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up and try another way . " <p> Van Tune calls airplanes " flying prisons . You have to sit there . You have to eat what they want you to eat . You have to watch what they want you to watch . The captain 's making an announcement every five minutes : ' Look out on the left side , and you 'll see the Institute of Mud . ' " <p> Airline industry officials counter the criticism by pointing out that their business has increased more than 200% since 1977 for America 's middle class . And , air travel remains the safest form of public transportation . Travel , experts say , has simply become an integral part of everyday life . <p> " When I was young , travel was a luxury . " says travel research expert Stanley Plog , who surveys 10,000 households annually . " Today it is a psychological necessity .
