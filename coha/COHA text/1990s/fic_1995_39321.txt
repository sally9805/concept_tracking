" Consider , if you will , the ancient Egyptians , " Stan Duval said , just as we were sitting down to dinner . " They had the correct attitude , in my humble estimation . " <p> I usually acted as though I had n't heard him . He made me nervous ; I could n't get used to him being around . My mother had married him in Yuma , Arizona , a year ago . I could n't figure out why . He was twenty years older than she was and he always wore his green pin-striped suit at the dinner table even if he 'd been walking around the house in stained underwear a half hour earlier . <p> Stan always characterized his estimations and assessments as humble . " In my humble way , I believe I am one of the most valued employees at Ryan . " He 'd said this more than once , as if he suspected we had our doubts . He was in charge of an equipment shed at Ryan Aircraft . His job was to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Inventory Control Engineer . That 's what he called himself . <p> Mom had fixed fried chicken , lima beans , and scalloped potatoes , Stan 's favorite meal . He made a point of bringing up obscure subjects at the dinner table in order to educate us . Mom had quit school after the eighth grade , and I was going to be a freshman at Lowmont High School , a school Stan had no respect for . <p> " What do you mean , dear ? " Mom said . She did n't care about Egypt , but she knew Stan liked to be drawn out after he 'd made a thought-provoking statement . It was a routine of theirs . <p> Mom 's eyes were glazed . She was still young-looking and almost pretty , even though she 'd gotten thick around the hips and had developed a sizable double chin . <p> Stan leveled his fork at her . " Firstly , their social organization  --  sine dubio , " he said . " Secondly , their thoroughly worked out religious bureaucracy . Thirdly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those chaps knew who they were and had no doubt about their self-worth . " <p> He forked some potatoes into his mouth and chewed them thoughtfully , jaws rotating side to side , camel-style , his heavy-lidded , Levantine eyes studying the ceiling . His phony British accent got on my nerves . Stan grew up in Boise , Idaho and had lived in California most of his life . He 'd never been to England , or anywhere else , as far as I knew . <p> " They had slaves , " I said . <p> " Ah , slaves , " he said . The word seemed to stir up favorable memories for him . The long syllable slid down his tongue like gravy . " As an institution , slavery was not the social horror the present day liberal thinker makes it out to be , " he said , smiling abruptly . <p> The accent was bad enough , but it was this smile that unnerved me most about him . Out of that gray , half-collapsed face came a sudden specter of long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life-loving vigor . It was a smile meant to charm and convince . But it was as if a corpse in its coffin had leered flirtatiously at the passing line of mourners . <p> " Take some more chicken , Tony , " Mom said to me . " There 's more than enough for your lunch tomorrow . " <p> " I 'm not hungry , " I said . In fact , my stomach was jumpy . Dillard Burdett was coming over in a few minutes . We were going to have Cokes in my basement room . My stomach was jumpy because Dillard 's sixteen-year old cousin , Wanda Schnell , from Escondido , was coming with him . Dillard had told me incredible stories about Wanda . Once , when he was visiting his aunt and uncle in Escondido , he and Wanda went out into a grove of avocado trees where she took off her underpants for him . <p> " I  --  saw  --  it  --  all , " Dillard had said . He spoke gravely , with arresting eloquence . " I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Did you show her yours ? " I had asked . This question was out of line , but my curiosity got the better of me . Dillard , like me and most of our friends , preferred the mutual presumption of experience . Innocence and fear , our true condition , could not be admitted . This was the unstated given that made our friendship possible . We never challenged each other 's boasts in the area of sexual experience , though we understood that none of us had any . Of course the boasts had to be reasonable  --  flights of fantasy were shouted down instantly . <p> " What do you think , turd ? " he 'd said , annoyed with me . We dropped the subject , lit cigarettes . <p> " The slaves of Egypt were well taken care of , " Stan continued . Stan was a speedy eater . He took large bites and worked his sideways-grinding jaws fast . He usually finished minutes ahead of me , and I was often reprimanded for inhaling my food and bolting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was too jumpy . <p> Stan lit a Chesterfield and blew a cloud of smoke into the hanging lamp above the table . " Slaves were highly prized possessions . And most certainly they were not excessively abused . You do not abuse your valuable possessions . It would make no sense to do so , " he said . " Are there any vestiges of doubt in your mind , Antonio ? " <p> I hated my name . The way Stan dragged it out made me hate it more . He gave it the correct foreign pronunciation . It made me feel like an immigrant . My real father was an immigrant , a barber from Palermo who now cut the hair of movie stars in Beverly Hills . " Georgio Castellani  --  Modern Hair Styling . " He wore his hair long , like the TV wrestler , Baron Leone . When I visited him , which was three or four times a year , he would give me a haircut that made me feel like a scented and oiled Sicilian hit man . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still squared-off and crisp . I could still smell pine trees and lemons . <p> " I guess not , " I said , wanting to leave the table . I did n't like to argue with Stan . He was an educated man , having graduated from Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo . He spouted Latin at us as if it were our second language . <p> " Quae nocent docent , " he said . " ' That which hurts , teaches . ' You need to be a realist in this turbulent world of ours . Slavery was cradle-to-grave welfare , all needs and wants attended to . " He flashed his dark smile engagingly . " Now , Antonio , I 've often mentioned how adamantly I am against the socialistic welfare system inspired by our late president , Franklin Delano Roosevelt . However , in ancient Egypt the social structure required a ready-and-willing force of considerable proportions . And remember , the Egyptians did not have the gasoline-powered machinery to do their work for them such as is available to the so-called modern world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette . He held it in the European style  --  cradled between thumb and forefinger , palm up . He blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling and squinted into it as if he could see pyramids and Pharaohs assembling in the haze . <p> I saw Egypt in my mind , 3,000 years ago . I saw myself as Mark Twain 's Connecticut Yankee making modern devices for the astonished Pharaoh , such as the two-way radio , television , the internal combustion engine , and the airplane . Diesel powered vehicles trucked stones the size of bungalows through the desert as the astonished Pharaoh applauded . Pharaoh 's daughter thought I was some kind of god . She came to me bearing gifts . " I 'm not a god , Laura , " I told her . " I 'm just a guy with some American know-how . " <p> I liked the name Laura . <p> My rumbling stomach interrupted my daydream . I needed to get ready for Wanda Schnell . I could n't believe Dillard was bringing her over . I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was only fourteen years old in the photo , she already had the full breasts and flared hips of a grown woman . Her face was blurry , but she seemed to be smirking at the photographer , her slitted eyes dark with knowledge . She was now sixteen , two years older than me . <p> " What about freedom ? " I said . <p> " Freedom ? " Stan passed his hand over the table , like a magician casting or removing a spell . " Bloody hocus-pocus , Antonio . Freedom is an earned condition of the mind . It has nothing to do with the ideals and schemes of a society . Socrates in his cell , staring at his cup of hemlock , was freer than you or I shall ever be . Freedom , Antonio , can not be conferred upon the profanum vulgus  --  that is to say , the common riffraff  --  by fiat alone . " <p> Mom snatched up her wine glass and drank it down in audible gulps . " What about their creepy ole zombies ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stan was her fourth , and worst  --  I thought  --  husband . <p> He flinched as if someone had flicked ice water in his face . Blatant ignorance always took him by surprise . He regarded her with his big , moon-yellow eyes . " I believe you mean mummies , dear . The so-called zombie is a vulgar Hollywood exploitation of a West Indies folk myth . " <p> I pushed away from the table . " Well , I 've got to cut out , " I said . " Dillard 's coming by . " <p> " Clean your plate first , Antonio , " Stan said . " Food such as this is the exception , not the rule . In Ethiopia or Zanzibar , the peasants are often forced to eat insects for want of grain and meat . " <p> " Did you really like it , Stanley ? " Mom said . She looked hopeful , and a little nervous all of a sudden . <p> Stan looked confused . " The chicken ? Of course I liked it , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite meal . Why do you ask ? " <p> " Because , well , it 's not really chicken . " <p> Stan looked at his plate , frowned , then looked at Mom . " I 'm afraid I do n't ... " <p> " It 's bunny rabbit , honey , not chicken . Safeway had a wonderful sale , and ... " <p> Stan jumped up from the table , his face turning a lighter shade of gray . He brought his napkin to his mouth and made a dash for the bathroom . He did n't have time to close the door . We heard him vomit . <p> " Guess he does n't like rabbit , " I said . <p> " He had three helpings , " Mom said . " Of course he liked it . " <p> Stan moaned horribly between upchucks . <p> " Lepus cuniculus , " I said . " A burrowing rodent . He liked it as long as it was chicken . When it was lepus cuniculus he hated it . He 's vomiting an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lucky 's and lit up . " I suppose you think that makes sense , smarty pants , " she said . <p> I heard Dillard 's shrill whistling out in the street . Then he yelled my name in big baritone shouts . His voice had changed in the last year . He sounded like a fully gown-up man , and he vocalized the change whenever the opportunity presented itself . <p> " See you later , Mom , " I said . <p> " Does he have to bellow like that ? " Mom said . <p> " He 's showing off , " I said . <p> I gave her a kiss and then smelled the booze . Even under the rabbit , potatoes , lima beans , and cigarette it was strong . Vat 69 . She 'd been drinking it most of the afternoon . When you considered who she 'd married , it was easy to figure out why . What did she ever see in him ? I felt sorry for her , wished she could have the man of her dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper , a tall , quiet man of unshakable integrity who never in a million years would lecture us about the ancient Egyptians or socialistic welfare . Gary Cooper , the brave yet modest man of High Noon , who did n't like to fight but could if forced to . Not a man full of fancy ideas , but a man who was silently wise . A man who ate slowly and chewed his food with good square jaws that went up and down , and who did not puke at the thought of eating rabbit . <p> I flooded and combed my hair at the kitchen sink , then went out to meet Dillard . His cousin , Wanda , lagged a few yards behind him . She seemed to be examining the neighborhood  --  the houses , the shrubs , the cars parked in the street . " Hey , neato , " she said . " Whose Stude ? " She did n't direct her question to either me or Dillard , content that someone would feel obliged to answer her . <p> " My stepdad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , still not addressing anyone in particular . She touched the long sleek fender , then began to stroke it . <p> It was a neat car , a brand-new 1948 Studebaker Champion , pearl gray and fast-looking . I often wondered how Stan had managed to pay for it since he was always complaining about how much it cost to support even a small family like ours . <p> " You wan na see his stuff ? " Dillard said . He meant my radio gear , which was down in the daylight basement where I had my room . <p> Wanda shrugged indifferently and sauntered toward us . I got my first clear look at her as she moved into the glow of our porch light . She was wearing flip-flop clogs and a loose-fitting cotton dress . Her face was round and puffy , and she had short fleshy arms that she kept folded against her breasts . Her eyes were small and deep-set . I could n't see them even when she faced me . She looked like a mature woman who 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down the driveway to the basement . The house was built on a slope , and my room , along with the garage , was under the daylight end . I switched on the lights . <p> " What 's all this junk ? " Wanda said . <p> " That 's his radio stuff , " Dillard said . " Tone 's a ham , a radio head . He got his license last year . Hey , is n't that right , Tone ? " <p> " Right , " I said . It always embarrassed me a little when strangers came into this room . My radio gear was a very personal thing . When strangers looked at it I felt naked . <p> The gear did look like junk , to the untrained eye . My homemade worktable was crowded with steel chassis studded with vacuum tubes , power transformers and coils . Tangles of green , red , and yellow wires were strung between them . Large-faced ammeters and voltmeters gleamed from hammered aluminum panels . A wall was covered with QSL cards from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works , Tone , " Dillard said . <p> Dillard and Wanda sat on my bed , a war surplus cot covered with surplus wool blankets . I kept a big Westclox alarm clock under it . When I wanted to raise stations in New Zealand or Australia , I 'd set the clock for three or four in the morning , the hours when darkness covered most of the Pacific Ocean . That was the best time for long-distance communication . <p> I switched on my receiver , a Hallicrafter S-40A , and tuned it to one of the busy ham bands . A garble of voices mixed with Morse code whined from the speaker . <p> " Yuck ! " Wanda said . <p> I turned down the volume and spun the dial to one of the commercial shortwave bands . A suave British voice was giving news items in brief sentences , pausing after each one to let the foreign listeners catch up . " Cairo 's response to the Crown was ambiguous at best , " the suave voice said . <p> " Pretty cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take up the question of policy concerning future relations with our former protectorate , " the slow-speaking Englishman said . <p> Wanda was looking around the room . It was n't much of a room  --  the walls were concrete blocks , except for the far back one which was just dirt . I 'd been digging in that dirt to increase the size of the basement  --  Stan wanted more storage room  --  but I had n't made much progress . Stan paid me fifteen cents for every wheelbarrow of dirt I hauled out . <p> My worktable was against a wall . High up on that wall was a short window at ground level . Antenna wires passed through this window and into the backyard . I 'd nailed some two-by-fours together , braced them with one-by-four splints , set them in three-foot deep holes sixty-four feet apart , and cemented them in . A folded dipole antenna hung between these masts , suspended on pulleys . Guy wires anchored to wood stakes webbed the backyard , which made careless strolling hazardous . Neither Mom nor Stan spent much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's all this stuff for ? " Wanda said . She 'd shoved Dillard off the cot so she could have it for herself , and was now lying on her side , her head propped on her hand . Her puffy face and stringy hair made her seem exotic . The great arc of her hip rose and fell slightly as she dangled her foot over the side of the cot and kicked rhythmically . Her flip-flop hung precariously from her toe . <p> Dillard sat on the concrete floor , spinning a king-size marble he 'd found . His legs had outgrown his torso . They took up most of the space between the cot and my worktable . His size twelve shoes scuffed against my chair . He was only about five-feet seven , but he had the legs and feet of a six-footer . " Hey , talk to somebody , Tone , " he slid . " Show her how you do that . " <p> I put on my earphones and turned on my homemade transmitter . When the tubes got hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the room . It was a smell I liked . I liked the smell of hot solder , too . I glanced quickly at Wanda to see if she had noticed the change . Her nose crinkled a bit , so I guessed she had . <p> I tapped out a series of CQs with my telegraph key . I got an answer right away . I pulled the earphone jack out of the S-40A so that the code would come over the loudspeaker . It was a strong station in Bakersfield , someone I 'd contacted before . I did n't like this guy because he used a Vibroplex semi-automatic speed key and sent his messages too fast . He had a lousy " fist . " His dashes were too short  --  you could easily take them for dots  --  and his spacing between word groups was erratic . He also bragged too much about his rig . A thousand watts generated by a pair of big Eimac tetrodes in the final amplifier . Anybody could do that if they had the money . <p> " There it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement . " Bakersfield , California . Over two hundred miles north . " I was a little vain about my ability to send and receive Morse code over long distances . <p> " Bakersfield , huh ? " Wanda said . " You actually want to talk to somebody you do n't even know in Bakersfield ? " <p> I tapped out the usual greeting with my old-fashioned brass key , a relic of the 1920s spark-gap days , a present from my Uncle Lamar . Then I turned to Wanda . Her small dark eyes seemed Oriental to me . Her flip-flop had dropped off and her little painted toes splayed and unsplayed in time to some rhythm she was hearing in her head . " I 've raised stations in Japan , " I said , trying to recover lost ground . <p> This seemed to interest her . " How can you do that ? " she said . " You do n't even speak Japanese . " <p> " It 's just the same as Bakersfield , " I said . " It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are right . Radio waves bounce off the ionosphere , hundreds of miles up . It 's like banking a pool ball . And language is no problem . We just use international Q signals . " <p> " Oh , I 'm sure , " she said , rolling her eyes . <p> " Tone 's a whiz , no lie , " Dillard said . " He can tell you how the stuff works , ca n't you Tone ? " He flipped the marble all the way into the dirt hole at the back of the basement . He went to look for it . " Tell her how it works ! " he yelled from the dark excavation . <p> " It 's actually pretty simple , " I said . I signed off with Mister Vibroplex from Bakersfield and unplugged the crystal from my transmitter . " This is a quartz crystal . It vibrates at about seven million times per second once you excite it with a small amount of electricity . Then this seven megacycle oscillation is amplified by this Pierce oscillator  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the signal is fed into a final amplifier  --  " I tapped on the bigger of the two tubes in my transmitter . " This boosts the power of that seven megacycle oscillation to about twenty-five watts . Next , I tune the final amp with this knob here , which is connected to a variable capacitor under the chassis . This plug-in coil is designed to match the crystal 's frequency  --  " I tapped on the forty-meter coil at the back of the chassis . " And then the tuned signal goes into the half-wave folded dipole antenna out in the backyard where it is radiated into space . You understand any of this , Wanda ? " <p> She was lying on her back now , hands behind her head and chewing gum methodically . " Any of what ? " she said . She stared into the joists of the kitchen floor , which was directly above us . It was an indolent , small-eyed gaze . <p> " How I can talk to Japan , " I said . <p> " How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She blew a bubble , popped it . " How do you know if it 's even coming from Bakersfield ? Maybe it 's just some joker down the street yanking your chain . " She raised up a little and looked at me . " Hey , Tony . Does that radio of yours play music ? " <p> The sound of my name coming from her lips made me feel strange . My stomach lurched . I switched the Hallicrafter to the broadcast band and tuned in a local station . Dick Haymes was singing " Together . " <p> " That 's more like it , " she said . She flopped her arms out to her sides and her bare legs dangled off the cot . She swung her feet lazily to the music . The thin cotton material of her dress gathered in the valley between her round thighs . The contours of her lower body were amazingly visible . Dillard crawled up to me on his hands and knees , pushing the big marble ahead of him . He tugged my arm hard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think she wants to show it to you , Tone , " he said . <p> " You said we were going to get Cokes , Dill , " Wanda said . <p> Dillard 's words made my mouth go dry as paper . " I 'll get them , " I whispered . <p> When I came back down , Wanda was sitting in my chair , fooling with the dials of the S-40A . She had my earphones on . I looked at Dillard . He was sitting on my cot . He shrugged , then winked . I passed out the Cokes . Wanda pulled the earphones off and got up . " All I can hear is noise , " she said . <p> We sat there , sipping our Cokes . Dillard burped every few seconds . He was swallowing air to do it . Wanda did n't seem to mind . <p> Dillard punched my arm . " Ask her , numb nuts , " he said . <p> My face got instantly hot . <p> " Ask me what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , shoving Dillard away . <p> The chair she was sitting on swiveled and she began to push herself in slow circles . " I 'm dizzy , " she said , letting her head loll about helplessly , as if her neck had been snapped . <p> " Tone here wants to see it , Wanda , " Dillard said . <p> I could have killed Dillard on the spot . I could n't swallow my last mouthful of Coke . It backed up into my nose . <p> Wanda got up and stretched , her woman 's breasts rising inside the cotton dress . The she turned her back on us and strolled to the dark end of the basement where I 'd been excavating . Dillard and I sat on the cot . <p> " Go on , " he said . <p> " You go on , " I said . <p> " I 've already seen it , " he said . <p> " Sure , two years ago . " <p> " It was last year , chicken . " He made a clucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burp was trapped halfway between my stomach and throat . <p> " We 'll stroll the lane ... together , " Wanda sang , at the dark end of the basement . Her voice contradicted her mature body . It was small and high , the voice of a little girl . <p> Dillard set his Coke down and pulled me off the couch . He gave me a hard shove toward Wanda , which gave me the momentum I needed , physical and mental . <p> " Sing love 's refrain .... together , " she sang . <p> Then I was standing next to her on the dark dirt floor , our shadows looming large and formless against the unevenly excavated area . <p> " What do you want , Tony ? " she asked . <p> " You know , " I mumbled . " What Dillard said . " <p> " What did he say ? I forget . " <p> My pickax was stuck in the wall of compacted dirt . I grabbed it and took a few energetic swings . I had n't worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rocks and the going was slow . Fifteen cents a load was n't half enough . For all his money , Stan was a cheapskate . <p> I hit a rock and big red sparks flew down toward our feet . I put the pick down . " He said that you were going to show it to us , " I blurted out . <p> " Dillard 's a geek , " she said . She folded her arms against her breasts . She bent and unbent a knee impatiently . " In fact , both of you are geeks . I bet you two are the geekiest freshmen at Lowmont . " The knee rocked faster and faster , building up speed . <p> I started to leave but she grabbed my arm and spun me toward her . She kissed me . Her hard lips were cold from the Coke and tasted of Double Bubble . She pushed me away but held me in place with her eyes . Even wide open they were small . But I could n't turn away from them . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw it all  --  the trembling pink thighs , the anonymous dark where they met . <p> The skirt dropped . " You 've got a real neat haircut , Tony , " she said . " Does your old man let you drive the Stude yet ? " <p> " No , I wo n't be sixteen for almost two years . " <p> " Gee , that 's hard to believe , " she said . <p> This made me feel good for a few seconds . Then not so good . <p> I went back to the cot . Dillard had an idiot grin spread across his face . " Shut up , " I said . <p> He grabbed me and wrestled me down to the floor . We rolled around , each trying to get an advantage . I could usually best him at wrestling , but now that his legs were long and his feet were size twelves , it was hard to handle him . We held each other in stalemated headlocks , unable to move . <p> Wanda put her bare foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth . " Hey , geek , " she said . " Time out . You got a toilet around here someplace ? " <p> " Upstairs , " I said . " Let go , Dillard . " <p> He did n't . I got his arm behind his back and pulled his hand up to the nape of his neck . He made a squawking noise . Then let go . <p> I led the way out of the basement . The path to the front of the house was steep and unlit . Wanda grabbed my hand . It was surprisingly small in mine . It was also damp . She held on tight , as if she needed my guiding strength . I was embarrassed , but also flattered . <p> Mom and Stan were watching television and did n't pay any attention to us . We had an Admiral with a three-and-a-half inch screen , and they were sitting up close to it , trying to watch " The Toast of the Town . " I stood behind them while Wanda went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of Bromo Seltzer . Every so often he let loose a complaining belch . <p> Wanda finished peeing . We went back outside . Dillard was sitting on the curb , throwing pebbles into a storm drain . " You 're a nice guy , Tony , " Wanda said . " There 's not many nice guys left . " <p> She had a bruised look in the pale streetlight . She was only sixteen , but she seemed to know what was in store for her . There would n't be very many nice guys in her life . <p> " Stay fine , Tony , " she said . <p> I cleared my throat once , then twice , but could n't think of anything to say . My jaws felt wired shut . <p> There was something just out of reach in this stopped moment between us . She knew what it was but could not articulate it . And if she could have , I could not have grasped it . It was this : She knew her fate . I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
