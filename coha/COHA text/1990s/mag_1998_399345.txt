A Southern city 's public edens yield plants to take home and ideas to copy . BY REBECCA SAWYER-FAY // ALREADY FAMOUS AS THE site of Patrick Henry 's plea for liberty or death and of Aaron Burr 's trial for treason , Virginia 's capital city is gaining renown of another sort these days : Richmond has lately become a hotbed not only of unusual plants , but of horticultural innovation , too . Grand estates and botanical parks abound in ideas for fresh planting schemes , while an annual flower show provides access to experts , nursery stock , and garden gear . Elizabethan Heritage At Agecroft Hall , in the Richmond neighborhood known as Windsor Farms , visitors sample the lifestyle of the rich and famous , circa 1600 . The framework for this spacious Tudor mansion came from England , where the 25room Agecroft Hall had stood for 500 years in the northwestern county of Lancashire . Today gardens designed by the celebrated early-20th-century landscape architect Charles Gillette envelop the genteel manor near the James River , its site since 1927 . A fragrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it would have during Elizabethan times , to take advantage of fresh aromas . Period plants include gilly- flowers ( Dianthus deltoides ) , heliotrope , and sweet autumn clematis ( Clematis paniculata ) . Nearby , Charles Gillette modeled a sunken garden on one at England 's Hampton Court . Here , more than 5 , ooo tulips , in 40 varieties , herald the new season each April . A knot garden features germander , green santolina , and English lavender , all raised and groomed to sinuous perfection . As in Tudor times , colored stones strewn between each " knot " enliven the scene . The four- plot plan of the adjacent Tradescant garden is symmetrically balanced with espaliered pear trees and rare species sought by John Tradescant and his father , who had served as gardener to England 's King Charles I and his queen , Henrietta Maria . It was here in Virginia that Tradescant gathered North American flowers and shrubs to add to collections begun by his father . At Agecroft , representative species include passionflower ( Passiflora incarnata ) and cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call or write the Agecroft Assn. , 4305 Sulgrave Rd. , Richmond , VA 23221 ; 804-353-4241 . ) English Inspiration Photograph At Agecroft Hall , a garden honors Britain 's John Tradescant the Younger ( 1608-1662 ) , who made three trips to Virginia in search of New World species suitable for cultivation in England . Natives on view include sunflowers , cardinal flowers , and spiderwort ( Tradescantia virginiana ) . // Almost unbelievably , an equally imposing mansion , also imported from England , stands next door . Virginia House 's eight-acre landscape ( designed , like the gardens surrounding Agecroft Hall , by Charles Gillette ) features mature trees and a broad range of English and American boxwoods . Depending on the season , flowering bulbs , daylilies , wildflowers , heirloom roses , hollies , and specimen plants from around the world whet the appetite for tackling new projects in one 's own garden . One idea easily borrowed is Gillette 's clever use of brick and stone walls , which keep temperatures five to 15 degrees above winter extremes . Species like creeping fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 are thus made welcome . Each April , an Old World Plant Sale held at Virginia House offers rare and unusual plants to take home . Of interest in 1998 will be new daylily varieties from the Richmond Area Daylily Society , as well as shrubs , vines , ground covers , and perennials from around the world . ( This year 's dates : April 11 from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. and April 12 from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M.

At Maymont , a loo-acre estate complete with opulent Gilded Age mansion , highlights include a Japanese garden , Italian garden , waterfalls , and a grotto with stalactites , mosaic paving , and sculptures of sleeping lions . The size of specimens in Maymont 's arboretum ( begun at the turn of the century ) suggests that the false golden larch from Japan , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be among the earliest such trees planted in North America . Maymont was the private fantasyland of James Dooley ( 1841-1922 ) , the entrepreneurial son of Irish immigrants , and his wife , Sallie May Dooley , a Virginia native keenly interested in history and gardening . The peripatetic couple brought home art and ideas from their global travels , endowing Maymont with the eclectic exuberance typical of America 's Gilded Age . Childless , the Dooleys bequeathed their money to a local orphanage and their house and gardens to the people of Richmond . Today , nearly 3oo , ooo visitors enjoy the estate annually-without charge . Native Plants and More On Lakeside Avenue , just north of the city center , the 80acre Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is fast becoming one of America 's outstanding resources for home gardeners and professional horticulturists alike . A Japanese Zen garden unique to the South will open this summer , and a new visitors ' center is also scheduled for completion this year . Other reasons to visit include the National Ivy Collection ( managed by the Ivy Society of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to view most named cultivars . Additionally , three greenhouses provide insight into the propagator 's art . Throughout the grounds , collections of antique roses , bog plants , hollies , hellebores , daylilies , and daffodils are especially strong . Native plants are also gaining attention at Lewis Ginter . Perhaps best of all , large populations of birds , butterflies , and bullfrogs point up the integrated , environmentally friendly approach taken by the staff .
