We are two guys from the future . " " Yeah , right . Now get the hell out of here ! " " Do n't shoot ! Is that a gun ? " That gave me pause ; it was a flashlight . There were two of them . They both wore shimmery suits . The short one was kind of cute . The tall one did all the talking . " Lady , we are serious guys from the future , " he said . " This is not a hard-on . " " You mean a put-on , " I said . " Now kindly get the hell out of here . " " We are here on a missionary position to all mankind , " he said . " No shit is fixing to hang loose any someday now . " " Break loose , " I said . " Hey , are you guys talking about nuclear war ? " " We are not allowed to say , " the cute one said . " The bottom line is , we have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall one said . " Save the art and let the world go . Not a bad idea , " I said . " But , Mira , it 's midnight and the gallery 's closed . Come back en la Manana . " " Que Bueno ! No hay mas necesidad que hablar en Ingles , " the tall one said . " Nothing worse than trying to communicate in a dead language , " he went on in Spanish . " But how did you know ? " " Just a guess , " I said , also in Spanish . And we spoke in the mother tongue from then on . " If you really are two guys from the future , you can come back in the future , like tomorrow after we open , right ? " " Too much danger of timeslip , " he said . " We have to come and go between midnight and four A.M. , when we wo n't interfere with your world . Plus we 're from far in the future , not just tomorrow . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the coming holocaust by sending them through a chronoslot to our century in what is , to you , the distant future . " " I got that picture , " I said . " But you 're talking to the wrong girl . I do n't own this art gallery . I 'm just an artist . " " Artists wear uniforms in your century ? " " Okay , so I 'm moonlighting as a security guard . " " Then it 's your boss we need to talk to . Get him here tomorrow at midnight , okay ? " <p> " He 's a her , " I said . " Besides , mira , how do I know you really are , on the level , two guys from the future ? " <p> " You saw us suddenly materialize in the middle of the room , did n't you ? " <p> " Okay , so I may have been dozing . You try working two jobs . " <p> " But you noticed how bad our ingles was . And how about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York speak worse ingles than you , " I said . " And here on the Lower East Side , funny suits do n't prove anything . " Then I remembered a science-fiction story I had once heard about . ( I never actually read science fiction . ) <p> " You did what ? " said Borogove , the gallery owner , the next morning when I told her about the two guys from the future . <p> " I lit a match and held it to his sleeve . " <p> " Girl , you 're lucky he did n't shoot you . " <p> " He was n't carrying a gun . I could tell . Those shimmery suits are pretty tight . Anyway , when I saw that the cloth did n't burn , I decided I believed their story . " <p> " There 's all sorts of material that does n't burn , " Borogove said . " And if they 're really two guys from the future who have come back to save the great art of our century , how come they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery , which was filled with giant plastic breasts and buttocks , the work of her dead ex-husband , " Bucky " Borogove . She seemed disappointed that all of them were still hanging . <p> " Beats me , " I said . " They insist on talking to the gallery owner . Maybe you have to sign for it or something . " <p> " Hmmmmm . There have been several mysterious disappearances of great art lately . That 's why I hired you ; it was one of the conditions in Bucky 's will . In fact , I 'm still not sure this is n't one of his posthumous publicity stunts . What time are these guys from the future supposed to show up ? " <p> " Midnight . " <p> " Hmmmmm . Well , do n't tell anyone about this . I 'll join you at midnight , like MacBeth on the tower . " <p> " Hamlet , " I said . " And tomorrow 's my night off . My boyfriend is taking me to the cockfights . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I may need you there to translate . My espanol is a little rusty . " <p> Girls do n't go to cockfights and I do n't have a boyfriend . How could I ? There are n't any single men in New York . I just did n't want Borogove to think I was easy . <p> But in fact , I would n't have missed it for the world . <p> I was standing beside her in the gallery at midnight when a column of air in the center of the room began to shimmer and glow and ... but you 've seen Star Trek . There they were . I decided to call the tall one Stretch and the cute one Shorty . <p> " Bienvenidos to our century , " said Borogove , in Spanish , " and to the Borogove Gallery . " Her Spanish was more than a little rusty ; turned out she had done a month in Cuernavaca in 1964 . " We are described in Art Talk magazine as ' the traffic control center of the Downtown Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the future , " Stretch said , in Spanish this time . He held out his arm . <p> " You do n't have to prove anything , " said Borogove . " I can tell by the way you arrived here that you 're not from our world . But if you like , you could show me some future money . " <p> " We 're not allowed to carry cash , " said Shorty . <p> " Too much danger of Timeslip , " explained Stretch . " In fact , the only reason we 're here at all is because of a special exemption in the Chronolaws , allowing us to save great art works that otherwise would be destroyed in the coming holocaust . " <p> " Oh dear . What coming holocaust ? " " We 're not allowed to say , " said Shorty . It seemed to be the only thing he was allowed to say . But I liked the way that no matter who he was talking to , he kept stealing looks at me . <p> " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his watch . " It does n't happen for quite a while . We 're buying the art early to keep the prices down . Next month our time ( last year , yours ) we bought two Harings and a Ledesma right around the corner . " <p> " Bought ? " said Borogove . " Those paintings were reported stolen . " <p> Stretch shrugged . " That 's between the gallery owners and their insurance companies . But we are not thieves . In fact ... " <p> " What about the people ? " I asked . <p> " You stay out of this , " Borogove whispered , in ingles . " You 're just here to translate . " <p> I ignored her . " You know , in this coming holocaust thing . What happens to the people ? " <p> " We 're not allowed to save people , " said Shorty . <p> " No big deal , " said Stretch . " People all die anyway . Only great art is forever . Well , almost forever . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That son of a bitch . But I 'm not surprised . If self-promotion can  --  " <p> " Bucky ? " Stretch looked confused . <p> " Bucky Borogove . My late ex-husband . The artist whose work is hanging all around us here . The art you came to save for future generations . " <p> " Oh , no , " said Stretch . He looked around at the giant tits and asses hanging on the walls . " We ca n't take this stuff . It would never fit through the Chronoslot anyway . We came to give you time to get rid of it . We 're here for the early works of Teresa Algarin Rosado , the Puerto Rican neoretromaximinimalist . You will hang her show next week , and we 'll come back and pick up the paintings we want . " <p> " I beg your pardon ! " said Borogove . " Nobody tells me who will or will not hang in this gallery . Not even guys from the future . Besides , who 's ever heard of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rude , " said Stretch . " It 's just that we already know what will happen . Besides , we 've already deposited three hundred thousand dollars in your account first thing tomorrow . " <p> " Well , in that case ... " Borogove seemed mollified . " But who is she ? Do you have her phone number ? Does she even have a phone ? A lot of artists ... " <p> " How many paintings are you going to buy ? " I asked . <p> " You stay out of this ! " she whispered , in ingles . <p> " But I am Teresa Algarin Rosado , " I said . <p> I quit my job as a security guard . A few nights later I was in my apartment when I noticed a shimmering by the sink . The air began to glow and ... but you 've seen Star Trek . I barely had time to pull on my jeans . I was painting and I usually work in a T-shirt and underpants . <p> " Remember me , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Spanish , as soon as he had fully appeared . <p> " So you can talk , " I said , in Spanish also . " Where 's your companero ? " <p> " It 's his night off . He 's got a date . " <p> " And you 're working ? " <p> " It 's my night off , too . I just  --  uh  --  uh ... " He blushed . <p> " Could n't get a date , " I said . " It 's all right . I 'm about ready to knock off anyway . There 's a Bud in the refrigerator . Get me one too . " <p> " You always work at midnight ? Can I call you Teresa ? " <p> " Please do . Just finishing a couple of canvases . This is my big chance . My own show . I want everything to be just right . What are you looking for ? " <p> " A bud ? " <p> " A Bud is a cerveza , " I said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you guys are from the future and not the past ? " ( Or just the country , I thought to myself . ) <p> " We travel to many different time zones , " he said . <p> " Must be exciting . Do you get to watch them throw the Christians to the lions ? " <p> " We do n't go there , it 's all statues , " he said . " Statues wo n't fit through the Chronoslot . You might have noticed , Stretch and I broke quite a few before we quit trying . " <p> " Stretch ? " <p> " My partner . Oh , and call me Shorty . " <p> It was my first positive illustration of the power of the past over the future . <p> " So what kind of art do you like ? " I asked while we got comfortable on the couch . <p> " I do n't like any of it , but I guess paintings are best ; you can turn them flat . Say this is pretty good cerveza . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he meant the beer but he meant the music . I also had a joint , left over from a more interesting decade . <p> " Your century is my favorite , " Shorty said . Soon he said he was ready for another petal . <p> " Bud , " I said . " In the fridge . " <p> " The cerveza in your century is very good , " he called out from the kitchen . <p> " Let me ask you two questions , " I said from the couch . <p> " Sure . " <p> " Do you have a wife or a girlfriend back there , or up there , in the future ? " <p> " Are you kidding ? " he said . " There are no single girls in the future . What 's your second question ? " <p> " Do you look as cute out of that shimmery suit as you do in it ? " <p> " There 's one missing , " said Borogove , checking off her list as the workmen unloaded the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front door of the gallery . Other workmen were taking Bucky 's giant tits and asses out the back door . <p> " This is all of it , " I said . " Everything I 've ever painted . I even borrowed back two paintings that I had traded for rent . " <p> Borogove consulted her list . " According to the two guys from the future , three of your early paintings are in the Museo de Arte Inmortal del Mundo in 2255 : ' Tres Dolores , ' ' De Mon Mouse , ' and ' La Rosa del Futuro . ' Those are the three they want . " <p> " Let me see that list , " I said . <p> " It 's just the titles . They have a catalog with pictures of what they want , but they would n't show it to me . Too much danger of Timesplits . " <p> " Slips , " I said . We looked through the stacked canvases again . I am partial to portraits . " De Mon Mouse " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rasta who always wore Mickey Mouse T-shirts . He had a collection of two . " Tres Dolores " was a mother , daughter , and grandmother I had known on Avenue B ; it was a pose faked up from photographs  --  a sort of tampering with time in itself , now that I thought of it . <p> But " La Rosa del Futuro " ? " Never heard of it , " I said . <p> Borogove waved the list . " It 's on here . Which means it 's in their catalog . " <p> " Which means it survives the holocaust , " I said . <p> " Which means they pick it up at midnight , after the opening Wednesday night , " she said . <p> " Which means I must paint it between now and then . " <p> " Which means you 've got four days . " <p> " This is crazy , Borogove . " <p> " Call me Mimsy , " she said . " And do n't worry about it . Just get to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , in Spanish . <p> " I thought you were Puerto Rican , " said Shorty . <p> " I am , but my ex-boyfriend was Jewish , and that stuff keeps forever . " <p> " I thought there were no single men in New York . " <p> " Exactly the problem , " I said . " His wife was Jewish too . " <p> " You 're sure I 'm not keeping you from your work ? " said Shorty . <p> " What work ? " I said forlornly . I had been staring at a blank canvas since 10:00 p.m . " I still have one painting to finish for the show , and I have n't even started it . " <p> " Which one ? " <p> " ' La Rosa del Futuro , ' " I said . I had the title pinned to the top corner of the frame . Maybe that was what was blocking me . I wadded it up and threw it at the wall . It only went halfway across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " So you know it gets done . Is there a blossom ... " <p> " A Bud , " I said . " In the door of the fridge . " <p> " Maybe what you need , " he said , with that shy , sly , futuristic smile I was growing to like , " is a little rest . " <p> After our little rest , which was n't so little , and was n't exactly a rest , I asked him , " Do you do this often ? " <p> " This ? " <p> " Go to bed with girls from the past . What if I 'm your great-great-grandmother or something ? " <p> " I had it checked out , " he said . " She 's living in the Bronx . " <p> " So you do ! You bastard ! You do this all the time . " <p> " Teresa ! Mi corazon ! Never before . It 's strictly not allowed . I could lose my job ! It 's just that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When you saw what ? " <p> He blushed . " Those little hands and feet . I fell in love . " <p> It was my turn to blush . He had won my heart , a guy from the future , forever . <p> " So if you love me so much , why do n't you take me back to the future with you ? " I asked , after another little rest . <p> " Then who would paint all the paintings you are supposed to paint over the next thirty years ? Teresa , you do n't understand how famous you are going to be . Even I have heard of Picasso , Michelangelo , and the great Algarin  --  and art is not my thing . If something happened to you , the Timeslip would throw off the whole history of art . " <p> " Oh . How about that . " I could n't seem to stop smiling . " So why do n't you stay here with me . " <p> " I 've thought about it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be around to come back here and meet you in the first place . And if I had stayed here , we would know about it anyway , since there would be some evidence of it . See how complicated Time is ? I 'm just a delivery guy and it gives me a headache . I need another leaf . " <p> " Bud , " I said . " You know where they are . " <p> He went into the kitchen for a cerveza and I called out after him : " So you 're going to go back to the future and let me die in the coming holocaust ? " <p> " Die ? Holocaust ? " <p> " The one you 're not allowed to tell me about . The nuclear war . " <p> " Oh , that . Stretch is just trying to alarm you . It 's not a war . It 's a warehouse fire . " <p> " All this mischigosch for a warehouse fire ? " <p> " It 's cheaper to go back and get the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It all has to do with Timeslip insurance or something . " <p> The phone rang . " How 's it going ? " <p> " It 's two in the morning , Borogove ! " I said , in ingles . <p> " Please , Teresa , call me Mimsy . Is it finished ? " <p> " I 'm working on it , " I lied . " Go to sleep . " <p> " Who was that ? " Shorty asked , in Spanish . " La Gordita ? " <p> " Do n't be cruel , " I said , pulling on my T-shirt and underpants . " You go to sleep , too . I have to get back to work " <p> " Okay , but wake me up by four . If I oversleep and get stuck here  --  " <p> " If you had overslept we would already know about it , would n't we ? " I said , sarcastically . But he was already snoring . <p> " I ca n't put it off for a week ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's anybody in the downtown art scene is going to be here tomorrow night . " <p> " But ... " <p> " Teresa , I 've already ordered the wine . " <p> But ... " <p> " Teresa , I 've already ordered the cheese . Plus , remember , whatever we sell beyond the three paintings they 're coming for is gravy . Comprende ? " <p> " En ingles , Borogove , " I said . " But what if I do n't finish this painting in time ? " <p> " Teresa , I insist , you must call me Mimsy . If you were n't going to finish it , they would have arranged a later pickup date , since they already know what will happen . For god 's sake , girl , quit worrying . Go home and get to work ! You have until tomorrow night . " <p> " But I do n't even know where to start ! " <p> " Do n't you artists have any imagination ? Make something up ! " <p> I had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're constipated you can work sitting down . <p> I padded and paced like a caged lion , staring at my blank canvas as if I were trying to get up the appetite to eat it . By 11:30 I had started it and painted it out six times . It just did n't feel right . <p> Just as the clock was striking midnight , a column of air near the sink began to shimmer and ... but you 've seen Star Trek . Shorty appeared by the sink , one hand behind his back . <p> " Am I glad to see you ! " I said . " I need a clue . " <p> " A clue ? " <p> " This painting . ' La Rosa del Futuro . ' Your catalog from the future has a picture of it . Let me see it . " <p> " Copy your own painting ? " Shorty said . " That would cause a Timeslip for sure . " <p> " I wo n't copy it ! " I said . " I just need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Same thing . Besides , Stretch carries the catalog . I 'm just his helper . " <p> " Okay , then just tell me , what 's it a picture of ? " <p> " I do n't know , Teresa ... " <p> " How can you say you love me if you wo n't even break the rules to help me ? " <p> " No , I mean I really do n't know . Like I said , art is not my thing . I 'm just a delivery guy . Besides  --  " he blushed . " You know what my thing is . " <p> " Well , my thing is art , " I said . " And I 'm going to lose the chance of a lifetime  --  hell , of more than that , of artistic inmortalidad  --  if I do n't come up with something pretty soon . " <p> " Teresa , quit worrying , " he said . " The painting 's so famous even I 've heard of it . There 's no way it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our last ... " <p> " Our what ? Our last what ? Why are you standing there with your hand behind your back ? " <p> He pulled out a rose . " Do n't you understand ? This Chronolink closes forever after the pickup tonight . I do n't know where my next job will take me , but it wo n't be here . " <p> " So what 's the rose for ? " <p> " To remember our ... our ... " He burst into tears . <p> Girls cry hard and fast and it 's over . Guys from the future are more sentimental , and Shorty cried himself to sleep . After comforting him as best I could , I pulled on my T-shirt and underpants and found a clean brush and started pacing again . I left him snoring on the bed , a short brown Adonis without even a fig leaf . <p> " Wake me up at four , " he mumbled , then went back to sleep . <p> I looked at the rosa he had brought . The roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laid it on the pillow next to his cheek and that was when it came to me , in the form of a whole picture , which is how it always comes to me when it finally does . ( And it always does . ) <p> When I 'm painting and it 's going well , I forget everything . It seemed like only minutes before the phone rang . <p> " Well ? How 's it going ? " <p> " Borogove , it 's almost four in the morning . " <p> " No , it 's not , it 's four in the afternoon . You 've been working all night and all day , Teresa , I can tell . But you really have to call me Mimsy . " <p> " I ca n't talk now , " I said . " I have a live model . Sort of . " <p> " I thought you did n't work from live models . " <p> " This time I am . " <p> " Whatever . Do n't let me bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting somewhere . The opening is at seven . I 'm sending a van for you at six . " <p> " Make it a limo , Mimsy , " I said . " We 're making art history . " <p> " It 's beautiful , " Borogove said , as I unveiled " La Rosa del Futuro " for her . " But who 's the model ? He looks vaguely familiar . " <p> " He 's been around the art world for years and years , " I said . <p> The gallery was packed . The show was a huge success . " La Rosa , " " De Mon Mouse " and " Los Tres " were already marked SOLD , and SOLD stickers went up on my other paintings at the rate of one every twenty minutes . Everybody wanted to meet me . I had left Shorty directions and cab fare by the bed , and at 11:30 he showed up wearing only my old boyfriend 's trench coat , saying that his shimmery suit had disappeared into thin air while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were in the middle of a Timeslip , after all . <p> " Who 's the barefoot guy in the fabulous Burberry ? " Borogove asked . " He looks vaguely familiar . " <p> " He 's been around the art world forever and ever , " I said . <p> Shorty was looking jet-lagged . He was staring dazedly at the wine and cheese and I signaled to one of the caterers to show him where the beer was kept , in the back room . <p> At 11:55 , Borogove threw everybody else out and turned down the lights . At midnight , right on time , a glowing column of air appeared in the center of the room , then gradually took on the shape of ... but you 've seen Star Trek . It was Stretch , and he was alone . <p> " We are  --  uh  --  a guy from the future , " Stretch said , starting in English and finishing en espanol . He was wobbling a little . <p> " I could have sworn there were two of you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that up ? " she whispered to me , in ingles . <p> " Could be a Timeslip , " said Stretch . He looked confused himself , then brightened . " No problem though ! Happens all the time . This is a light pickup . Only three paintings ! " <p> " We have all three right here , " said Borogove . " Teresa , why do n't you do the honors . I 'll check them off as you hand them to this guy from the future . " <p> I handed him " De Mon Mouse . " Then " Los Tres Dolores . " He slipped them both through a dark slot that appeared in the air . <p> " Whoops , " Stretch said , his knees wobbling . " Feel that ? Slight aftershock . " <p> Shorty had wandered in from the back room with a Bud in his hand . ln nothing but a raincoat , he looked very disoriented . <p> " This is my boyfriend , Shorty , " I said . He and Stretch stared at each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . Then it was over . <p> " Of course ! " said Stretch . " Of course , I 'd recognize you anywhere . " <p> " Huh ? Oh . " Shorty looked at the painting I was holding , the last of the three . " La Rosa del Futuro . " It was a full length nude of a short brown Adonis , asleep on his back without even a fig leaf , a rose placed tenderly on the pillow by his cheek . The paint was still tacky but I suspected that by the time it arrived in the future it would be dry . <p> " Reminds me of the day I met Mona Lisa , " said Stretch . " How many times have I seen this painting , and now I meet the guy ! Must feel weird to have the world 's most famous , you know ... " He winked toward Shorty 's crotch . <p> " I do n't know about weird , " said Shorty . " Something definitely feels funny . " <p> " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I handed Stretch the painting and he pushed it through the slot , and Shorty and I lived happily ever after . For a while . More or less .... <p> But you 've seen I Love Lucy . <p>
