As darkness falls on these chilly February evenings , a bright , steady light ascends in the eastern sky . This red intruder among the stars of the constellation Leo is Mars , the world next outward from Earth in orbit . We pass between Mars and the Sun on the night of February 11/12 . As we do so , Mars appears opposite the Sun in our sky , a configuration called opposition , and shines unmistakably at magnitude  --  1.2 . Near its time of opposition , Mars rises around sunset and wheels across the sky all night . It stands highest in what Robert Frost called " the lunar noon , " in other words , at midnight . Because the Moon also lies opposite the Sun when it appears Full to us , Mars can be found near this month 's Full Moon on the night of February 14/15 . The other bright object near Mars is 1st-magnitude Regulus , Leo 's brightest star . At opposition the orange-red planet lies 8deg northwest of the white star . The best time to observe any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars is no exception . At opposition Mars not only remains visible all night , but also shines brighter ( at magnitude  --  1.2 ) and appears larger in a telescope ( at 13.9 " in diameter ) than at any time in the past two years . Its brightness means that Mars outshines every star except for glittering Sirius , the - 1.5- magnitude luminary of Canis Major . Its size means the often subtle markings on the planet 's surface will be easier to see in a telescope . The bright white north polar cap stands out prominently even on nights of relatively poor seeing . The intriguing dark markings , which change as the Martian winds blow and desert sands shift , are the features to hunt for when conditions are excellent . Despite Mars ' prominence this winter , veteran observers or the Red Planet may notice that the planet appears dimmer and smaller than it has a recent oppositions . Indeed , this is Mars ' most distant opposition in many years . Because the planets do n't orbit the Sun in perfect circles , the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in their orbits . Mars had a very close opposition in 1988 , when its perihelion , or closest point to the Sun , came at about the same time Earth passed between Mars and the Sun . At that opposition , Mars lay only about 35 million miles from Earth and appeared exceedingly brilliant in our night sky . This year , Mars will reach aphelion  --  its farthest point from the Sun  --  on March 14 , and will lie nearly as far from the Sun as it can when we pass between it and the Sun . At opposition this year , the Red Planet shines from across more than 60 million miles . Yet we on Earth still have something wonderful to think about at this opposition of Mars . In the past year , much progress has been made on the Pathfinder space mission to the Red Planet , which is scheduled for launch next year . In 1997 , Pathfinder will become the first spacecraft to land on Mars in more than 20 years , coming to rest about 500 miles southeast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if life ever got started on Mars , this is a likely spot , although the Pathfinder mission is n't designed to search for actual fossils of Martian algae or bacteria . Thus in this year of Mars ' opposition , new life is being breathed into the space-borne exploration of the planet . When you see Mars burning like a pale flame in our night sky , think ahead to a time when a spacecraft from home may unearth evidence of early life on this desert world . As Earth passes between the Sun and Mars , another outer planet falls so far behind us that it slips into the Sun 's glare . In early February , look low in the west-southwest an hour after sunset for a final look at Saturn . The planet appears relatively inconspicuous at magnitude 1.0 . The young crescent Moon aids in finding Saturn on the evening of February 1 , when it passes just over 5deg from the ringed planet . Saturn will pass behind the Sun in early March and afterward appear in the predawn sky . After the planet emerges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane of this planet 's rings , and Saturn will for a time appear ringless . While Saturn disappears from the evening sky in February , another celestial sight comes into view . After twilight fades away , start scanning the western sky for the legendary zodiacal light . If you 're observing from a very dark site , you should see this softly radiant , rounded pyramid of light , which looks even " milkier " than the Milky Way . From the southern states or tropical latitudes  --  where the ecliptic always makes a steep angle to the horizon  --  the zodiacal light can be so noticeable that unknowing observers ask about it , wondering what it might be . It can be mistaken for the light of a city or town just beyond the horizon . Yet those who travel west on a dark road at night will find that the light always stays ahead of them , until the artificial light of a real city or town washes it from view . The zodiacal light arises from sunlight reflecting off dust grains that move in the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of the ecliptic , the path of the Sun , Moan , and planets , across our sky . That 's why Northern Hemisphere observers are most likely to see it in February and March : The ecliptic then makes a steep angle to the western horizon after sunset . Remember to look for it under dark country skies . It will appear once the last vestiges of twilight have faded away . By midevening the zodiacal light has dipped below the horizon and Saturn has set , leaving Mars the lone planet in the sky until after midnight . Pluto , the next planet to rise , wo n't affect Mars ' dominance , however , because it remains invisible to the naked eye . The diminutive planet lies in far western Ophiuchus and comes up around 1 a.m . It will climb higher in the sky and thus become easier to search for with a telescope as it approaches opposition in May . While Pluto is faint , the next planet to appear is bright . While Pluto is invisible to the naked eye , this next planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around 2 a.m. and appearing well up in the southeast before dawn . And it appears a little higher in the predawn sky each day . Jupiter ranks as the second-brightest planet after Venus and shines this month at magnitude - 2.0 . It has joined Pluto in the non-zodiacal constellation Ophiuchus , the Serpent Bearer , though it lies well south and east of its neighbor . The telescopic view of Jupiter is always spectacular . This month the planet 's disk measures 35.4 " across . The brightest planet o all , Venus , comes up about two hours after Jupiter and lies about 15deg below the giant planet as dawn begins to break . At magnitude - 4.2 , Venus appears even more dazzling than Jupiter . Telescopically , this planet appears gibbous , that is , more than half illuminated but less than full . Its disk measures 18.2 " in diameter . Uranus and Neptune emerge from the dawn around mid-February and sweep up behind Venus before the month ends . Venus passes 0.7deg north of 8th-magnitude Neptune on February 26 , when the waning crescent Moon also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come in early March . The innermost planet , Mercury , passes between Earth and the Sun on February 3 . It then moves into the predawn sky and will reach greatest elongation on March 1 . This is not a favorable elongation of Mercury , how ever ( at its best , the planet appears only 5deg high 30 minutes before sunrise ) , and you will have difficulty seeing it .
