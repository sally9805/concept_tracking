The clean life may throw off a delicate balance in the immune system <p> Sweeping along 14th-century trade routes , an infectious agent left a trail of incomparable devastation throughout Asia and Europe . In China , this plague slashed the population from 125 million to 90 million by the century 's end . In Cairo , the Black Death-so called because of the dark , swollen lymph nodes that characterize the disease-claimed 7,000 lives a day at its height . Before it subsided , the plague had wiped out one-third of Europe 's population . <p> In most of the world today , the plague has receded to a distant , if gruesome , memory . So , too , at least in developed countries , have smallpox , typhoid fever , cholera , diphtheria , and polio declined . One by one , infectious diseases that once ravaged society and preyed especially on children have been quelled by better sanitation , antibiotics , and vaccinations . <p> While raising barricades against deadly scourges , however , the industrialized world has also shielded people from the microbes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A growing number of scientists now suspect that stamping out these innocuous organisms is weakening some parts of children 's immune systems , allowing other parts to grow unchecked . Such an imbalance , they theorize , triggers a host of illnesses , including asthma , allergies , and even such autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and the most severe type of diabetes . <p> This notion , called the hygiene hypothesis , arose from scientists ' inability to explain the rising prevalence of asthma and allergies in many developed nations . The National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute estimates that in the United States , for example , the incidence of asthma is now 1.75 times what it was in 1980 , and for children less than 4 years old , 2.60 times the earlier incidence . <p> Pollution and allergens-such as mold and pollen-can take some of the blame , but not all of it . " One needs an explanation " for these trends , says Graham A.W . Rook of the University College London Medical School , who is one of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting healthier , not less healthy . " <p> For several years , investigators have been uncovering signs that illness can result when the immune system lacks practice fighting bacteria and viruses . This evidence , however , has been circumstantial and too sparse to convince most scientists . <p> " It 's greeted with some skepticism , and quite rightly , because we need more evidence , " says Richard Beasley of the University of Otago 's Wellington ( New Zealand ) School of Medicine . " In many respects , it 's still early days , but the evidence is starting to build . " <p> Recently , several epidemiological and experimental studies have converged to put the hygiene hypothesis on firmer ground . Some researchers are already trying to create vaccines that mimic potentially crucial immune effects of the microbes that society has banished . <p> According to the hygiene hypothesis , the immune system is like a set of scales that sometimes tips sharply enough to send a person 's health tumbling . <p> One arm of the immune system deploys specialized white blood cells , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the body . Counterbalancing this , another arm of the immune system tries to hit the intruders even earlier . It produces antibodies that block dangerous microbes from invading the body 's cells in the first place . This latter strategy exploits a different variety of white blood cells , called Th2 lymphocytes . The Th2 system also happens to drive allergic responses to foreign organisms . <p> At birth , an infant 's immune system appears to rely primarily on the Th2 system . According to the hygiene hypothesis , the Th1 system can grow stronger only if it gets exercise , either through fighting infections or through encounters with certain harmless microbes . Without such stimulation-and ordinary colds and flu do n't seem to do the trick-the Th2 system flourishes and the immune system teeters toward allergic responses . <p> Early support for this view came from Julian M. Hopkin , now at the University of Wales Swansea , and his colleagues . In 1997 , they reported on a study of 867 Japanese children given a vaccine against tuberculosis . Those who showed a strong Th1 response-indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer allergies and asthma than did those who did n't show a Th1 response . <p> Furthermore , among the children who had allergies , some showed a decrease in allergy symptoms after receiving the vaccine . The ones with a strong Th1 response to the tuberculosis vaccine were six to nine times as likely to benefit as were children who did not have such a response . <p> In the past , some scientists speculated that the Th1 system required periodic infections , particularly in childhood , in order to develop properly , but most researchers now dispute that idea . Rook argues that the main problem may be that kids have become too squeaky clean . He suspects that children need contact not with disease-causing agents but with innocuous microbes in soil and untreated water-particularly organisms called mycobacteria-to give the Th1 system enough of a workout . <p> " The lymphocytes have got to be kind of marinated in this stuff in the early years of life , " he says . If they are n't , he says , the Th2 system grows ever stronger , priming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research has further hinted that the cleanest environments may be the best breeding grounds for allergies and asthma . In the January Journal of Clinical and Experimental Allergy , Swiss researchers reported that hay fever was less common for farm children than for urban children or for rural children who did n't live on farms . <p> Several years ago , scientists found that children in large families-particularly the younger siblings of brothers-had fewer allergies than children in small families did . Researchers speculated that exposure to the germs brought home by older siblings protected the younger children from allergies . <p> Bolstering that idea , a study in the Feb. 6 Lancet found that children from small families who entered day care before age 1 were less likely to develop allergies than those who entered day care later . No such difference emerged for children from larger families , suggesting that early day care may have stood in for the protection provided by dirty older siblings . <p> The antibiotics that thwart infectious diseases may also be spurring some immune disorders by killing off beneficial bacteria ( SN : 11/22/97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hopkin and his colleague Sadaf Farooqi , now of Adenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge , England , reported that children who received oral antibiotics by age 2 were more susceptible to allergies than children who had no antibiotics , a finding that Beasley 's group in New Zealand recently replicated . <p> The results , says Hopkin , may indicate that antibiotic treatment , which depletes the harmless bacteria within the gut , derails normal immune development in early life . A study in the May 1 Lancet by researchers in Sweden reinforced that idea : Children from families that avoid antibiotics and vaccinations have fewer allergies than other children do . <p> Encouraged by the epidemiological studies that support the hygiene hypothesis , some investigators are now trying to prevent illness by pumping up the Th1 system artificially . A team led by Stephen Holgate at the University of Southampton in England is conducting human trials of a Th1-inducing vaccine to counter asthma . The vaccine is made from a mycobacterium called SRL172 . In a preliminary analysis , the vaccine appears to dampen asthma patients ' symptoms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clinical analyses by the end of September . <p> Despite promising advances , however , scientists acknowledge the limitations of the hygiene hypothesis . " We 're desperately oversimplifying , " says Rook . " We do n't understand , really , why sometimes Th2 responses go crazy . Even I do n't think Th1-Th2 balance is going to be the whole story . These are terribly complicated phenomena . " <p> Without proper training early in life , some research suggests , the immune system can grow confused and lash out at inappropriate targets , including digested foods in the gut . At the University of Iowa in Iowa City , Joel V. Weinstock , David E. Elliott , and Robert W. Summers are examining the possibility that immune imbalances may contribute to the rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease , a condition in which the lining of the intestines becomes chronically inflamed . <p> Unlike Rook , however , the Iowa researchers propose that the scales tip too sharply toward Th1 responses , leaving the Th2 response weakened . " Overall , I would disagree with Dr. Rook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliott says . " It 's true that we 've limited our exposure to tuberculosis , and many of the viral agents have been controlled by vaccines . However , we still contact many , many viruses and bacteria that provide us with more than adequate Th1 experience . " <p> Weinstock 's group proposes that the Th1 dominance stems from a lack of parasitic worms called helminths . Despite parasites ' bad reputation , the researchers contend that helminths are important members of the intestinal community . Throughout evolution , they say , the human immune system has grown to depend on helminths to suppress overly aggressive Th1 responses to bacteria , viruses , and dietary proteins . Because modern sanitation has largely eliminated intestinal parasites , the immune system sometimes begins to attack the lining of the gut . <p> In May , the scientists reported at the annual meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association in Orlando , Fla. , results of experiments in which they induced in mice a condition similar to inflammatory bowel disease . Mice deliberately infected with helminths , however , were protected from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has begun to investigate similar treatments for animals with autoimmune disorders , in which the immune system attacks parts of its own body . <p> The team has also begun treating a few patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease by giving them a drink spiked with eggs from a harmless whipworm . Of six patients studied so far , all showed substantial improvement in their symptoms , the researchers reported at the May meeting . <p> The research is only an initial foray , the Iowa researchers caution , and controlled clinical trials are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment . Furthermore , they say , the precise role of Th1-Th2 balance in inflammatory bowel disease remains unresolved , as does the seeming contradiction between their research and the hygiene hypothesis ' assumption that Th2 responses usually overpower Th1 responses . <p> By separating people from their dirty origins , the modern antiseptic environment may have also provoked the medical equivalent of friendly fire : autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes . <p> The radical notion that infrequent exposure to infectious agents contributes to autoimmune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies and asthma stem from such deprivation . In fact , says Michael B. Oldstone of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , most scientists hold the opposite view-that if anything , infections help drive autoimmune diseases ( SN : 6/21/97 , p. 380 ) . <p> However , a group led by Irun R. Cohen at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , believes it has evidence to the contrary . These researchers find that rats raised behind germ-free barriers are more prone to developing arthritis and diabetes than rats raised in normal , germ-filled environments are . <p> According to Cohen , rats in the ultraclean environment do n't develop the immune cells that can suppress autoimmune responses . If that 's the case , he suggests , it may be possible to develop a vaccine to stimulate the aspects of the immune system needed to avoid autoimmune disorders . <p> " The immune system organizes itself through experience , just like the brain , " Cohen argues . However , he notes , other factors , such as environmental toxins , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanliness is the only problem . It 's a complex system . The first thing is to ask the right questions , but we have to be patient about the answers . " <p> Ultimately , it may be that asthma , allergies , and other immune disorders are the price society has to pay for escaping the appallingly virulent infectious diseases that have struck down children over the centuries . Scientists are n't quite ready to accept that proposition , however . <p> " We might be able to do something clever that can actually get the best of both worlds , " says Beasley . " I think , at the end of the day , that will be the challenge , because we certainly do n't want to go back to the days of old . " <p> By SIRI CARPENTER <p> Fly bites help guard against Leishmania <p> The occasional bite of a blood-sucking fly may fine-tune the immune system and deter some infectious diseases . <p> Laboratory mice are best equipped to resist leishmaniasis-a tropical disease carried by sand flies-if they have had a little practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Chicago . <p> David L. Sacks and Shaden Kamhawi of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Md. , twice exposed six laboratory mice to disease-free sand flies before introducing flies carrying Leishmania parasites . These exposed mice resisted infection better than did mice that had not been previously bitten by sand flies , the researchers found . <p> Sacks and Kamhawi propose that the saliva of flies that did not carry Leishmania may have stimulated the mouse immune systems , arming them against infection when they later encountered disease-carrying flies . <p> " It 's fascinating work , " says immunologist John R. David of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston . " People who live in areas where they get leishmaniasis are obviously bitten a lot by sand flies , and this suggests that that in some ways protects them . People , however , still get the disease , but it might be much worse or affect more people if they had not been bitten by uninfected flies first .
