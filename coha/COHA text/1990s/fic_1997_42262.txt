Many little girls dream of becoming a princess . But I never imagined a handsome knight on a white horse riding with me into the sunset . Instead , I dreamed of performing at the Grand Ole Opry . I stood on the stage there a thousand times in my dreams before I stood there in real life when I was 13 . <p> In November 1996 , when I was 14 , I returned to Nashville to play at the Opry for a second time . I was pleased to be on the program so close to Christmas . Backstage , a tile floor runs between the dressing rooms , and just before I was to go on stage , I heard footsteps approaching . <p> " I want to meet you , " a woman said , walking through my open door . <p> I turned and my gaze locked with my daddy 's favorite singer . Her eyes were blue and clear , like mountain pools . Her hair was high , each strand in place , stiff with spray and she wore a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All my life , I 'd heard her records , seen her on television , and felt as if I 'd always known her . I ca n't tell her name . I promised her I would n't . Keeping her identity a secret was the only condition she imposed before agreeing to let me share her story-and the lesson she taught me that changed my life . <p> " I 'll bet you 're glad to be in here and off of that travelin ' contraption you call a bus , " she said with a smile . <p> " You must be reading my diary , " I joked . At that time , I was traveling with ten others inside an old bus in which most of the space was taken up by our instruments . <p> " I 'll tell you something else , " she said . " I 'll bet you 're ' bout ready to move to Nashville . " <p> " What makes you say that ? " I asked . <p> " I can see it in your face , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " <p> I knew others before me had shared my dream of achieving success in country music . I was n't its owner , just its current caretaker . I was dreaming of what I wanted to do ; she was dreaming of what she 'd done-and that link was drawing us into a quick friendship . <p> " As long as you 're goin ' to be spendin ' so much time in Nashville , you ought to let me show it to you , " she said . <p> I was n't sure what she meant . I stared blankly . <p> " There 's more to Nashville than the Grand Ole Opry , " she said . " This city has a pulse and a soul , and you need to feel it if you 're goin ' to fit in with the musicians that 'll he playin ' on your records . " <p> " Well , I 'm going to my record company office tomorrow . " " Honey , " she said , " that 's the last thing I 'm talkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and written from the street When our songwriters and musicians want inspiration , they do n't go to a front office to get it . " <p> I was at a loss . Was this legend offering to take me on a personal tour of Nashville ? " Well , uh , " I said , " what will we do ? I mean , you 're famous . You ca n't go out in public , can you ? " <p> " Most of the stargazers who come to Nashville were n't born when my career was hot , " she said . " Most of ' em would n't recognize me . " She laughed , but she did n't seem amused . " No , honey , " she went on , " you 're the one they 'll want to see . So I 'll tell you how to avoid attention . Wear loose clothes . I suggest a pair of overalls . And get a cap with a bill that you can pull low , and wear the biggest sunglasses you can find . Do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , taking her advice , I pulled my hair back into a ponytail and worked it through the hole in a baseball cap , put on sunglasses the size of saucers , and crossed the crowded hotel lobby unnoticed to join my self-appointed escort in the parking lot , where she was waiting for me in an old , dented , and rusty black Cadillac . I slid into the front seat and saw that she was wearing the same gaudy outfit she 'd worn the night before . How could anyone not notice her ? , I thought . <p> " Ready to go , honey ? " , she asked . <p> We rode to a neighborhood called Lower Broadway . We passed the Ryman Auditorium , the home of the Opry for more than 30 years , before it moved to the Grand Ole Opry House . Then we parked in front of the Ernest Tubb Record Shop , for years the site of the famous Midnight Jamboree , a radio show my parents had told me about that went on the air promptly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I sung in that place many a time , " the legend said . <p> We walked along l , ower Broadway , passing stores , restaurants , and night clubs that , she explained , had opened since 1988 , the year of country music 's most recent popularity explosion . <p> " I wish I knew what to get my family for Christmas , " I said . Earlier , not yet ready to tell my parents about my plans with the veteran star , I 'd told them I was going Christmas shopping-which is why they let me out without a chaperone . <p> " Give your dad what Jesus gave His dad , " she said . " ' That 's all parents really want from someone your age , anyhow . " <p> I was astonished at her reply . What did she mean ? What did Jesus give his dad ? <p> We turned left on Second Avenue . I melted into the casually dressed crowd as if I were camouflaged . My escort was as bright as a neon light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My eyes were peeled for gifts for my parents , but I was n't a very good shopper . And anyway , my maom and dad were happy with what they had and did n't really want much else . <p> My new friend and I headed west , passing more open stores . We crossed Fourth Avenue , then headed south at Eighth Street . The day 's temperature was at its high , yet it was wonderfully cool . In the air was the sound of country Christmas songs . It was magical . <p> Caught up in the spell , I was slow to notice that we 'd wandered out of the tourist district . <p> Suddenly , she stopped and spun on her heels . " Now look back down there , honey , " she said . <p> My eyes raised to the towering BellSouth Building , the tallest building in Tennessee . Closer to us stood the new Nashville Arena , which was scheduled to open soon with a Christmas concert by Amy Grant and Vince Gill . <p> " That arena holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build , " she said . " Now , look directly in front of you . " <p> I had been staring so hard into the distance that I had n't noticed the one-story structure a few feet before me . It was a rescue mission . I wondered about the placement of the modern building so close to a home for the down-and-out . Before I could comment , a man held out his palm to her . <p> At last , I thought , an old fan has recognized a former great . <p> But he did n't . All he wanted was a handout . In the shadow of millions of dollars worth of new construction , a poor man begged for pennies . <p> The woman beside me opened her purse . She handed the man silver . I noticed how hard she dug to find the pieces . He did n't say anything . <p> " I got one more stop on our little walkin ' tour , " my escort said , and she led me into , of all places , the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday travelers . <p> " This place is full of people goin ' home for Thanksgiving ' , " she said . Then she added , " Come this way , " and led me to the docks where the buses arrived and departed . A roaring coach polled into a stall , and passengers wearily strolled offexcept those carrying guitars . They had a bounce in their step . It was obvious they were coming to Nashville to try their luck in the music business . <p> " Now watch , " the legend said . <p> A voice over the loudspeaker announced the final call for loading . We stood and observed people get on a bus with a destination we did n't know . <p> A moment later , three men stepped through the giant doors . Two held guitars . Their heads were bowed , their shoulders stooped , their steps slow . <p> " These are the guys who 've tried and failed in Nashville , " she said . " See the one without a guitar ? I 'll bet he had to sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she went on , " You can see the Grand Ole Opry on Friday and Saturday nights , but what you 're seein ' here is another show that goes on ev day of the year . " I knew she was right . The men getting on the bus wore failure like a uniform . " How did you know about this ? " I asked . <p> " I rode one of these buses myself once , " she said . Then she extended a hand that held two bus tickets . " Shall we ? " she asked . <p> " What in the world ... ? " I said . <p> " We 're not goin ' far , only about fortyfive minutes down the Interstate . We 'll latch another ride right back . We should be home in plenty of time for supper . " <p> I stared at her in disbelief . A light snov was beginning to fall and early darkness was creeping over the blinking downtown . The bus driver revved the engine and looked at us , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she turned and walked onto the bus . I was astonished when I felt myself following her . <p> Inside the bus , she opened her purse and handed me a wrinkled , yellowed newspaper clipping . " Here , " she said . " Open this careful . It 's part of the reason I brought you out here . " <p> Gently , I unfolded the creases until a full newspaper page lay on my lap , dated November 24 , 1950 . <p> " That was the day after Thanksgivin ' , " she said . <p> Blinding Snow Sweeps Area , Mercury Tumbles , read the headline . <p> " I 'm told it was Tennessee 's worst snowstorm of the century , " she said . " I can tell you there ai n't been none that bad in these here parts since . " <p> On the last Friday in November 1950 , the temperature fell 39 degrees in nine hours in Nashville , the paper said . And it kept falling . By 2:00 A.M. , it was one degree above zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of a blast of cold air from Kansas , and they not only took Tennessee by surprise , but they also took many lives . <p> " Why are you showing ne this ? " I asked . <p> " You see where it talks about the city buses runnin ' behind schedule ? " she asked . " Well , the highway buses was in even worse shape . " <p> " And you were on a btis during that storm ? " I guessed . <p> She nodded . " I was goin ' to a show somewhere in Arkansas , and we 'd been out of town for about an hour when the storm hit , too long to turn back . A lot of the passengers panicked and begged the driver to stop . But he could n't . Somebody would have driven right into the back of us . He was drivin ' as slow as that bus would go without its engine dyin ' and he was drivin ' blind . Finally , we hit the shoulder of the road and drove right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honey , we was stuck . " <p> By now , I was hypnotized by her story . " You were in that ditch all night ? " I asked . <p> " Yes sir , all night and then some , " she said . " And everybody was carryin ' on somethin ' awful . I guess we would 've kept warm if the driver had n't turned off the engine , but he did what he had to do . The exhaust could n't go out the tailpipe , ' cause the pipe was under the snow . So thc fumes had nowhere to go ' cept right up into the bus , and it would 've killed us . We would 've fallen asleep and woke up dead . " <p> She smiled and said , " I can laugh about it now , honey , but then , well ... The engine had n't been off but thirty minutes before it got cold , and inside an hour it was like bein ' in an icebox . Some people could n't help thinkin ' they was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big ole burly guy . ' We 're gon na freeze to death , ' he started yellin . " ' <p> She shuddered , remembering . " By midnight , we had paired off , two to a seat , and we hugged , sharin ' our body heat , you see . see . We just sat there shiverin ' and clingin ' to each other . Not one car came by all night . " <p> " Why did n't somebody go for help ? " I asked . <p> " Somebody tried to , honey , but the driver could n't get the door to open against the piled snio . I think that was the most terrifyin ' time of all , when we finally accepted that nobody might come for us , and we could n't go to fetch nobody neither . " <p> She looked around the warn bus taking us through the Tennessee twilight , as if to relish its safety . " By nightfall on the second day , people was exhausted . We 'd run out of food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We was felin ' our most doomed when somebody got the idea of bumin ' the bus seats to get warm . We wondered why we had n't thought of it earlier . The driver had a wrench , and we took the seats out of the floor . We cut the vinyl with a pocketknife , and pulled out the stuffin ' . It was dry and caught fire real quick . We had to open one window , and one guy used cardboard to fan the smoke outside . It did n't work all that good-we breathed a lot of smoke-but a fire inside that tin btis heated things up real nice . " <p> With that , she rose from her seat and walked toward the front of the moving bus . " Come on , honey , " she said , looking down at me . " This is where we get off . You tell the driver to stop . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Do n't worry , " she said , " we have a ride . " <p> I obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him we wanted to get off in the middle of nowhere . He looked blankly at me , then shrugged and stopped the bus . <p> I heard passengers muttering as we stepped off into the night . The door closed with a bang . Fumes boiled around as the bus roared back into motion . Then all was quiet . <p> I was suddenly hit squarely in the face by headlights and nearly blinded . They were from her black Cadillac , parked a few feet away . <p> " That 's our ride , " she said . <p> I had no idea who was in the dark interior . <p> When the door opened , a dim light shone inside I recognized the driver as the man outside the Nashville mission , the one who had extended his hand . I thought she 'd given him coins ; instead , she 'd probably handed him her car keys . <p> " This is Carl , " she said . <p> Carl said nothing except , " Get in . " <p> We rode in silence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew sve were going to the site of that bus accident 46 years earlier and wondered why . What will there be to see ? I thought to myself . <p> For the first time since meeting this woman , I felt afraid , isolated and alone in the middle of nowhere . <p> " All right , " she said to Carl , " it 's right about here . Should be any time now . " <p> Suddenly , the dark country evening exploded into daylight . A cross , perhaps ten feet tall and six feet wide , stood before us , less than 20 feet from the pavement 's edge . Carl stopped in the middle of the road . <p> " What do you think , honey ? " she roared . " Ai n't it dandy ? It 's made of a steel frame covered with weatherproof plastic and filled with nvelvc-volt bulbs . When it lights up , you can see it for miles . " <p> I could n't take my eyes off the brightness . " What is this ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out here in this field ? " <p> " Whoa , little missy , " she said . " Not so fast . You see that utility pole over there ? " <p> I could see it . <p> " Well , I got an electric meter in my name on that pole . It 's rigged so that the cross only lights up when somebody drives by . " <p> " What makes the lights come on ? " 1 asked . <p> " Oh , a simple motion detector switch , " she said <p> Carl turned off the engine . We were parked in the middle of the road , but in no danger . On that flat land , we could have seen approaching headlights for a mile . <p> My friend got out of the car to stand on the edge of the pavement . " Look here , " she said . <p> I stepped to her side . <p> " Those weeds in front of us cattails , " she said . " They grow in standin ' water . Looks like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't it , honey ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " Well , they 're actually six or seven feet tall . They 're growin ' from the bottom of the ditch that our bus drove into when this was just a blacktop road . Just from lookin ' you 'd have no idea that twenty-eight people nearly breathed their last oit here , would you , girl ? " <p> " Why did you put the cross out here ? " I asked , knowing she intended to answer that cluestion in her own good time . But my curiosity would n't wait . <p> " Come on , honey , get in the car , " she almost whispered . " I 've got one more story to tell you . " <p> I looked at the cross through the rear window as we drove off . When we were out of the motion range , it went off . Tlle highway and fields behind me were black . It had truly been the only light for miles . <p> MY FRIEND CONTINUED HER STORY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . " I 'd had a visitor in Nashville on November 23 , 1950 , " she said . " It was my dad . He 'd ridden a bus all the way from Conway , Arkansas , where I was raised . He 'd written me three letters sayin ' he 'd be at my house for Thanksgivin ' , but I did n't answer ' em . " <p> " Why ? " I asked . <p> She thought for a long period , then turned to face me . " When my daddy came to see me , it was after me and him had n't spoke for a long time , " she said . " See , honey , back in my day , ' nice ' girls did n't go into show business . My daddy wanted me to marry a young boy from our church who took a shine to me . He was gon na be IXI fl preacher . Daddy wanted me to have babies and live my life right there . But I wanted to sing country music , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disowned me . He said I was shamin ' the family by runnin ' to the ' devil 's music . The only time he contacted me was to tell me that my mama had died . I got his letter the day of her funeral . " <p> She looked out the window for a long moment then continued . " In the late forties I had hit records and people knew me far and wide , " she Said . " And , lo and behold , that 's when I started gettin letters from Daddy sayin ' he was a comin ' to see me . You know what I thought ? I thought he was comin ' to ask for money . Everybody asks you for money when your career takes off honey . You 'll find that out . Well , I was pretty big for my britches . So I did n't see my own daddy whenhe came to town . I locked my door and put up a sign that said , GONE UNTIL SOMEONE IS GONE . HE KNOWS WHO HE IS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , I find out that daddy slept that night in the bus station . I guess he had a ticket to get home , but no money for a room . He left town without ever seein ' his only child . His heart must 've been more broken than anyone ever described in a country song . " <p> She choked on her words . We must have ridden a full mile before she spoke again . <p> " That Thanksgivin ' Day , I took the bus on to my show , and thought I would n't have to see him , " she said . " And then the accident happened . The hardest think of all about it was that I was diabetic and takin ' insulin . In those days , I carried it inside a little thermos in ice . I 'd take it out about an hour before the injection to let it warm , then put it into a syringe . That night , when the bus was in the ditch and it came time for my injection , I realized I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysterical , ' cause if the cold did n't kill me , the diabetic shock would , I knew for sure . I began to cry , and held it back as much as I could . I did n't want to upset the other passengers . I told you some of them was already out of their minds with fear . " <p> For a few moments , the only sound in the car was the purr of the highway beneath us . Then she went on . " This old fellow with dark glasses came from the back of the bus and sat beside me . He wore a knit cap pulled over his forehead and ears , and he had long hair and a shaggy beard , the kind men wear when they do n't have no money for a barber . <p> By the way he felt his way into the seats I knew he was blind , and I realized he must have been the only person on the bus who heard me cryin ' . He asked me what was wrong , and I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about diabetes . He told me it had taken his sight , and he used insulin too . <p> " ' I got enough here for both of us , ' he said , and I thought he had the sweetest spirit I 'd ever seen in a man . Then he told me my speakin ' voice was a pretty as my sigin ' . <p> " You know me ? ' I asked . <p> " Oh , yes , I know exactly who you are , ' he said . In fact , you 're my favorite singer . ' <p> " I ca n't believe you recognized me just from hearing me talk , ' I said . <p> " Well , us blind folks see with our ears , ' he said , ' and we can recognize a lot of things folks do n't think we can . " ' <p> At this point in her story , the legend nuzzled down into her seat , her expression serious , said , and distant . " I clung to that old man all night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " He had some awful sandwiches in his dirty satchel , but that was more than I had , and he shared them with me . " <p> " I guess the man and his medicine mean more to you than anything ever has , " I said . <p> " That 's an understatment , " she said . " But I 've got a little more to tell you about that man . During that time , when he spoke , it was mostly about his daughter , and how much he loved her , and how he wanted to move to Nashville to live out his life next to her . I really think that talkin ' about her did more to keep him alive than anythin ' . Then he got quiet for the longest time , and I thought he 'd fallen asleep . That 's when we heard the men beatin ' on the bus door . " <p> She told me how a rescue party that had begun searching for them a few hours after the bus had n't arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a pilot had noticed the smoke coming from the burning seats <p> " When them rescuers pounded on the door , people began to yell and cheer like you 've never heard , honey , " she said . " I shook the old mall to wake him , but it was no use . I thought he 'd entered insulin shock , but the truth is , he 'd been in shock for hours . You see , he had n't had any spare insulin like he 'd told me . He 'd only had enough for himself , and he 'd been givin ' that to me . In the darkness , with his hat and beard and dark glasses , I could n't tell he was in shock <p> He 'd been shiverin ' something fierce , but I thought that was from the cold . The main died in my arms , and I had n't even known . it . " <p> She closed her eyes , remembering . " I was so weak that the rescuers had to carry me up the hill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man who had saved my life was left behind , in the cold and dark . ' He 'll be all right , ' somebody said . This weather will keep him froze till he can get a proper funeral . ' <p> " I was readin ' the newspaper two days later , " she went on , " about our accident and the rescue , and it had the name of the man who 'd saved my life . That name jumped off the page at me . It was my dad . " <p> I felt like I 'd been hit with a hammer . <p> " When I would n't see him in Nashville , " my frind continued , " he used his return bus ticket to head back for Conway , and we ended up on the same bus by chance . Only I do n't guess it was much of a coincidence , ' cause not that many people traveled in those days , and not that many buses headed west out of Nashville . I had n't seen him in so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he 'd gone blind . How could I have known it was my dad ? " <p> She shook her head . " He probably did n't know I was on that bus till he heard me talkin ' . When I 'd talked to him about my diabetes , he had n't bcen surprised , probably ' cause he 'd always wondered if his daughter turned out diabetic-like him . He knew that givin ' his last insulin to me could kill him , but he did it anyway . The dad I 'd refused to see gave his life for me . " <p> I turned toward the window , watching the dark landscape . I did n't want her to see me cry . <p> " You see , honey , " she said , " if you have family , you have everything . After Mama died , my only family was my dad , and I turned him away . But for you , no matter how hard things is in your new life , you have your family , and they 'll go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you can give them ? " the legend asked . " Think about it . It 's what I was talkin ' about when we was downtown . " <p> I had no idea what she meant and told her so . " I do n't remember any Bible verse about what Jesus gave Joseph for any Christmas , " I said . <p> " Honey , you misunderstood me , " she said . " When I suggested that you give your family what Jesus gave his dad , I meant to say Jesus ' heavenly father , God . And what Jesus gave Him was complete loyalty . " <p> I was totally confused , and she could tell . <p> " Look , " she said . " Jesus gave the ultimate loyalty . His father commanded Him to die on a cross , and Jesus was loyal to His father 's wishes . If I had family today , and if any one of them asked anything of me , I 'd obey . Family comes first-above wealth , fame , career , and Success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral she attached to it , were too much for me . I struggled to hold back the tears . Only then did she turn in her seat to face the road before her . <p> WE PULLED INTO NASHVILLE WITH MORE time left in the evening than I had realized . I had n't traveled far , but I 'd heard much , and that made me feel I 'd been gone a long time . <p> At the hotel , I stepped from the back seat and stood under the awning . <p> My friend rolled down her window . " Thank you for goin ' with me , " she said . " I hope you learned somethin ' today that you 'll carry with you always . " Those were my exact thoughts . * <p>
