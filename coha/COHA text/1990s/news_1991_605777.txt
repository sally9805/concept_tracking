<p> Every night , Neil and Nancy Grunberg walk through their home in Bethesda looking for tiny toys that could spell disaster for their daughter , Vicky , who turns 1 on Christmas . <p> Vicky is in the middle of the " put everything in the mouth phase , " said Neil Grunberg . And to complicate the situation , the couple 's older children , Samantha , 5 , and Jesse , 2 1/2 , have toys that often contain small parts . <p> " It 's a real problem , " said Grunberg , who checks his children 's toys regularly . <p> " It 's a little like dieting , " he said . " If you do n't have the food around , you wo n't eat it . The major way to prevent a choking problem is not to have small toys around . " <p> Desirability vs . Safety <p> Throughout the country this holiday season , parents are trying to balance the concerns of what children want against what 's good for them , and most important , how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be deadly . According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) , 37 children died of toy-related injuries from January 1990 to September 1991 . Many more were hurt . In 1990 alone , 164,500 people suffered toy-related injuries serious enough to require treatment in a hospital emergency room ; nearly 79,000 were children under age 5 . <p> " There are few things more senseless than injuries to children caused by unsafe toys  --  playthings intended to bring pleasure and joy , offering instead pain and sometimes death , " noted the report Trouble in Toyland , issued last month by the U.S. Public Interest Research Groups , a private , nonprofit consumer group . <p> Since 1980 , 25 children also have died from injuries caused by nonpowder firearms , such as BB guns or pellet rifles , the CPSC reported . An additional 25,000 children under age 19 were harmed by such firearms in 1990 , according to Robert Tanz , an emergency room physician who is part of a group that monitors children 's accidents for the American Academy of Pediatrics . Tanz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 7 percent of these injuries were to the eye , while 10 percent of non-powder firearms injuries involved the face . <p> " Eyes are lost , and several children are killed each year , " Tanz said . The reality is that these toys are " not appropriate . . . We are in the dark ages with all of this . " <p> Experts cautioned , however , that toy-related deaths still make up a small part of the children who are hurt or die in accidents . Nearly 50 children each year drown in pails of water and roughly 300 die in swimming pools . <p> Screening Toys <p> Consumer advocates and federal officials caution that the first line of defense is parental monitoring . <p> " There 's a big misconception that if toys are on the market they must be safe , " said Carol Pollack-Nelson , an engineering psychologist with the CPSC . " But we 're not the FDA the Food and Drug Administration , and we do n't screen toys before they are marketed . " <p> As many as 6,000 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the Toy Manufacturers of America , a trade association based in New York , which notes that the majority of those toys undergo testing by the manufacturers . <p> To find the toys that are potentially dangerous , the CPSC does spot checks , testing them for sharp edges , for buttons that could pull off or small pieces that might break off and choke a child . In addition , they investigate complaints about toys . <p> U.S. Customs agents also screen toys manufactured abroad , since 70 percent of American toys are either made abroad or have parts made overseas , according to the CPSC , which works with Customs agents in their search . <p> About 165 different toys were voluntarily recalled in 1990 " because they did not comply with CPSC regulations or posed a substantial hazard , " said CPSC chairman Jacqueline Jones-Smith . That 's a decline from the 252 types of toys voluntarily recalled in 1989 , according to the CPSC . <p> Jones-Smith said , " We are finding improvement in the market . " Overall , according to the CPSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer groups see it differently . They point out that just those 165 recalled types of toys represented a total of 10.8 million unsafe products that had the potential to harm children . " Every year from the end of October to the beginning of November , we do a survey that is n't very comprehensive , " said Lucinda Sikes , an attorney with U.S. PIRG . " And every year , we find dangerous toys on the market . " <p> Two other consumer groups do surveys as well , Sikes said . Each group finds about eight to 10 different dangerous toys on the market . <p> Examples of toys the PIRG investigators say are still available in some stores include : a cowboy hat made in the United States that has a plastic closure ring that could be pulled off the cord and could choke a child ; a wooden puzzle with two small pieces that pose choking hazards ; a formula racer car made in China with small rubber tires that easily pull off . <p> Age and Risk Factors <p> According to statistics from CPSC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most likely to get hurt in three ways : from falling off a bike without a wearing a helmet , by taking a dive off a fast-moving skateboard or by being injured by a nongunpowder firearm . Among children under age 3 , choking and strangulation are the biggest threats from toys . <p> Infants 5 months and older can get into trouble with playthings or mobiles that hang across a crib or playpen . These toys become most dangerous just at the age when babies can turn over , get on all fours and may strangle or hang themselves by becoming entangled in them . Seven infants have died this way since 1971 . <p> For older infants and toddlers , choking is the leading concern because youngsters love to put new objects into their mouths . At least 165 youngsters have died by ingesting or aspirating toys since 1980  --  the year the CPSC enacted new regulations designed to minimize the threat of injury . <p> Such figures show that " the current standard for toys is inadequate , " said Mary Ellen Fise , product safety director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocacy group . <p> As further evidence , Fise and other consumer advocates point to the children who have choked to death even on toys that were in compliance with federal regulations . <p> Objects small enough to fit within a test cylinder with a one-inch diameter opening and a length of 1 1/4 inches on one side and 2 inches on the other can not be marketed to children under age 3 , according to the U.S. standard . <p> That regulation prohibits the sale of toys that are small enough to enter a young child 's lower throat and block air passages , said Sikes of U.S. PIRG , but it " does not eliminate toys or other objects that can enter the mouth and obstruct the airway by blocking the mouth and upper throat . " <p> Small Parts <p> About a quarter of those killed last year died from toys that met the regulations , according to the CPSC . One 2-year-old boy died when he choked on a toy chicken included in a preschool building set . A 14-month-old child died from a cylindrical wooden building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with federal requirements for toys , according to U.S. PIRG 's report Trouble in Toyland . <p> So did a popular line of 2-inch tall toy figures called Little People , manufactured by Fisher-Price and often cited by consumer groups as a reason for toughening toy safety regulations . Little People were armless , legless figures included in garage and farm sets intended for use by children ages 2 to 6 . They passed the federal size requirements for small toy parts . Yet in 1990 , three children , all less than a year of age , died when the figures became lodged in their throats . <p> " We did feel and we still feel that the Little People are safe for the ages that we established for them , " said Jack Martin , a spokesman for Fisher-Price . " They still meet all the safety standards . " <p> At the annual toy fair in February , the company introduced a new , chunkier line of Little People . " We did it for two reasons , " Martin said . " One is to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other is to give the Little People more fun features . " The newest Little People are aimed at children 18 months to 6 years old and include a device that allows the figures to move when twisted . " But we still feel that the old line of Little People are safe , " Martin said . <p> Legislation Proposals <p> The Consumer Federation of America , U.S. PIRG and and other consumer groups are pressing to have toy standards tightened and to improve toy labeling . New legislation introduced last month by Democratic Congresswoman Cardiss Collins of Illinois would " help reduce death and injuries , " Sikes said . <p> Known as the Toy Injury Reduction Act , the proposed legislation would change packaging and labeling of toys intended for use by children ages 3 to 6 . The new toy labels would highlight potential risks even when toys met CPSC standards . Under the proposed law , toy manufacturers would be required to label what age child the toy is intended for and would need to clearly state which youngsters might be harmed by playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There are no mandatory warning labels to warn parents about the choking hazards of small toys and toys with small parts that are marketed to children over 3 , but still pose a hazard to younger children , " Collins said . " In addition , there are no mandatory warning labels to warn parents of the hazards of some innocent looking but potentially dangerous toys  --  balloons , marbles and games of skill that have small balls . " <p> To meet current CPSC requirements , for example , balls must be 1.25 inches in diameter in order to be targeted for sale to children under age 3 . " But we know that balls as large as 1.7 inches have killed some children who choked on them , " said the Consumer Federation 's Fise . <p> Some toy companies already label toys prominently with warnings , according to the toy manufacturers ' trade association . These special cautionary labels highlight not just the danger of small parts but also the presence of heating elements that might burn a child , toxic chemicals ( such as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp points of toys that may be dangerous before being assembled . <p> But most toy labels are " so blandly written , " Collins said , " that parents may believe them more related to educational development than to safety . As a result , in many cases , parents receive no effective warning that tells them a toy may end up choking and killing a child . " <p> Increasing the size of labels on toy packages is something that Alfreda Wright of the District favors . " The labels should stand out just as much as the toy name , " said Wright , who was shopping with her grown son Nathaniel for gifts for various children in their family . <p> Wright lives with her 19-month-old granddaughter , Amber , as well as some nieces and nephews who range in age up to 7 years . " When you have children of different ages around , you have to look at the labels and consider how many small pieces a toy has , " she said . " That 's why we did n't buy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small sticks and balls . " Amber puts everything in her mouth , " Wright said . <p> Some age labels are even mistakenly viewed as a kind of challenge by parents who are convinced that their children are far more advanced than the average youngster the same age . But according to child development experts , many 4-year-olds simply do not have the manual dexterity required for a 6-year-old 's toy and may feel very frustrated trying to play with it . <p> Bob Hundemer , a toy tester and engineering technologist for the CPSC Laboratory in Gaithersburg , recalled the walkie talkies that relatives sent to his son , age 4 . " They required two distinct hand motions to use , and a 4-year-old ca n't deal with that , " Hundemer said . <p> The facility in Gaithersburg where Hundemer works is one of three laboratories conducting CPSC tests . In a small plain room that doubles as his office , he subjects toys to the kind of abuse that children might give them during play . He uses long thin calipers to try to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hand rails of plastic trains and attempts to remove bells and whistles from toys , which might pose a choking hazard to a child successful at doing the same thing . He checks for sharp edges and drops toys repeatedly to see how they hold up . <p> In the end , however , testing how toys are used and identifying the appropriate ages they are intended for is not the whole answer . In many situations , part of the problem with toy safety is that children of various ages play together and often share the same toys . <p> " My son is playing with plastic blocks , " said Tanz of Children 's Memorial Hospital in Chicago . " My daughter , who is below the age where these blocks are supposed to be appropriate , is playing in the same room . . . What am I going to do , lock the kids in separate rooms ? Or not let the older child play with an appropriate toy ? " <p> Letting young children play unsupervised when there are small toys around that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other extreme , restricting toys too much for older children because of fears for younger children . <p> " Sometimes , you can cause a house to sink to the lowest common denominator and deny an older child proper equipment or space , " said Kent Ravenscroft , associate professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at both George Washington University and Georgetown University .
