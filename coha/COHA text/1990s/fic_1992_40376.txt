Mike had just had four days down in Brighton being got at by his wife so when he had a chance to go at Sheridan he went for her on all four pins . He was shorter on four pins than two but , by god , on four pins , he was the fiercer . He was fiercer as a shorter man , than as a taller one . Taller , he was tolerable . On all fours , he bit . The way he bit at Sheridan was in a froth ; the where was at her spherical . He lost his coolth he yelpt he screamed he waxed sarcastic , called her names , waned luminous and whined and finally spat some words at her that made her need to go wash . <p> This event with Mike reminded Sheridan of something that occurred a few Octobers back when France had sent tornado winds across The Sleeve to whack the English . Maybe France had not dispatched them , maybe Belgium had , but anyway they came from Europe , killer winds that to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gusts , true , and therefore Gallic . <p> This is how the English hate the French : there is a history , there are novels , even written in that blood . More than men hate women , English hate the French . Mais non ! you say ? men do not ' ate wimmin  --  Hey : they love us so much , why the fist . You say they never raise a hand , say whut ? they never raise an army against women , never let their chivalric relax , never tax their standards , never grind an ax on distaff , jamais ? <p> Ponder just a sec here , hon , please , this tiny proposition : <p> The Almighty may be nothing more , nor nothing less , than one keen ax , an act , in space . <p> But about this hurry-Cain the French launched way back when in that October  --  knocked down all the trees in Kent , knocked down trees in London , ruined Kew , deflowered it perhaps forever , turned up roots in Battersea , exposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking , Can we not get rid of dead wood in our celebrated places ? <p> As the winds ripped bits of London from her fundament on that October night , Peter woke and did n't tell his wife , " Christ sake , it 's those bloody French . " Instead he got up from their bed and lit a candle and remarked to her ( her name is Sue ) : " It 's really in a blow out there . " Just then beneath their bedroom window in the street a car passed and a voice called through a bullhorn , " Do not panic . Stay within your houses . Do not breach the elements outdoors . " Peter turned to Sue and took her hand . They woke their children , led them downstairs by the candle 's light to the front room on the ground floor where they all sat down , two adults , two children , on the carpet , while Peter talked to them about their lives , about the wind , and then they waited . A patrol car passed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not panic : Stay within . <p> Peter watched his children as they listened to the voice outside : <p> And Peter listened too . <p> Peter was convinced it was their Last Advice . <p> He forgot his ordinary elements , the ordinary things we 're used to , fire water air and earth : Peter had forgotten ordinary storms . What he thought was outside , raging , was a **34;0;TOOLONG , the storm preceding Nothing-for-eternity , the one which ravages the earth as if released from Hell , the nuclear one , n-u-c-l-e-a-r storm . <p> Some men are like that , these days : <p> New Aged . <p> So he stayed up with his wife and children through the night and through the French-sent hurricane and then the morning came , a French-sent pointe du jour arising from the East : Sue boiled water when the power came back on , they sat down at the kitchen table and ate Weetabix with milk and whole grain toast with marmalade , but do n't you wonder what the children thought ? <p> You have to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So is this death ? <p> " I told them I was sorry , " Peter said to Sheridan a few days later when he rang her up to swap Adventures-in-the-Wind . <p> " You mean you told them they were going to die ? " she asked . <p> " Honestly , I do n't remember , " Peter said . " We sang songs and read some poetry . It was very moving , " he acknowledged . <p> Every time that Sheridan began to wonder what exactly Peter might have told his wife and children in the ( he thought ) nuclear event , she 's reminded of her new friend Jimmy in the backseat of the taxi in Manhattan with his carp . Goldfish , as he calls them  --  in their goldfish tank , the four of them , an aerated goldfish tank perched ( no pun intended ) on his lap , backseat of a taxi on their way to Chinatown because he has to move and somehow it makes sense to him to give the fish away and where else in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank included . She could see him , golden Jimmy , in the backseat of the taxi , water sploshing on his chinos on the drive downtown , excuse me , ' scuse me , stop here , hi , will you adopt my fish ? <p> O Proteus , O Jimmy , O the protean variety of men , their shape and form , most of them would not keep goldfish in the first place and ( even if they did ) most of them would flush ' em , sell the tank and start up someplace else . <p> But some of them are sweet ones : <p> Men . <p> Some of them are sweet ones who can fill your teeth with holes and make your blood run quick , but a man has to rub his face with ashes , beat a tom-tom to communicate , is the sort of person that Rousseau referred to as a singularly noble savage : Sorry you ca n't catch my drift , doll , sorry you ca n't get my wild thing but , see , I 'm a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in huts with other men and sing and cry away from women , women can not know they do not know they can not understand the loneliness the pathos of the modern man 's condition what it 's like to be so out of touch with myth and when we go to combat we kick ass , we drive a kick ass bargain , have a kick ass way with congress and if you ca n't appreciate the way we move I 'll kick your ass from here to a Supreme Court ruling that will teach you a few lessons , listen : This is who I am : I am the man : and I 'm in charge . <p> There came a certain point when Mike was tearing into Sheridan that she thought every man who is a violent man acts violent in the same way , only different . She remembered that her friend Pauline once said that Ezra would come home and need to break some china like a crypt- or a path-ologist has got to break a code . <p> She knew a woman who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her she was second-rate . That she was stealing his ideas . That she was living off his back . That she was not providing him the sex-u-al tension that a person of his cosmic appetite required . He felt watched , he said , and shackled . He felt claustrophobic . He felt out of touch with his own myth and that was her fault , too . He told her women get inside their men like worms and drive them crazy . He told her she was wormy then he told her she was insecure . He told her that her ass had a peculiar angle , that her tits were idiotically succumbing to the force of gravity without a fight , that she was growing several chins and furthermore she was n't brilliant she could not recite the capitals of all the nations of the world . But all the same , remember , Sheridan believed there were sweet men , somewhere , the beauties , good guys , ever luvin ' dudes : but why : why bother , at her age , every time she met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I buy a used scar off this man ? " The big fist wears so many faces ; you can never tell . Sheridan herself had once lived with the king of violent men and she had never seen his violence coming till it came and when it came it was the storm that comes before annihilation , it achieved that force , the kind of force that made her take an air-raid posture on the floor and sometimes Sheridan is forced to wonder whether Christ was made , the substance and the need for him created from the Roman state , those martial kick ass Romans , man , those preindustrialist kick ass specialists who ruled the god damned world , nobody fucked with them , man , till the wild men came : <p> Those Visigoths : <p> Those new age men . <p> How did he did he come to want to need to stamp his image on the world  --  man kind  --  as if he 'd minted it , as if the world were currency , renewable , she wonders , bring your dirty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all brand new . Sheridan 's sweet father used to say he got so angry with the things he heard about the world sometimes his anger made his eardrums pop . <p> And then he killed himself . <p> Climbed a tree in a State Park and put a rope around his neck and fell to earth ; the milkman saw him hanging from a limb above the ground fog from the road near dawn next day . <p> Sheridan has many thoughts about that milkman , what he saw : <p> What he told his wife and children , later : <p> Whether he had nightmares . <p> And she remembers that her homeroom teacher , Mr. Lewis , a propos of nothing one day sidled up to her when she was maybe fifteen , sidled up ( he was an L-shaped man whose chin was nearly always resting on the handle of his cane ) and said . " We are living , as a species , in at least three centuries at once , " and from New York her new friend Jimmy , that fair Beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pimps who spit on everyone on Twenty-Ninth Street and Eleventh where he 's moved , without his fish , into a rathole of a building from which he dreams , as people do , of ways and means to fabricate escape into a better place . From Boston Thadi writes to her about his trip to Greece , the prison in the mountains where he watched his father executed by the English has been made into a grand hotel and there I stood , he writes to Sheridan , I stood exactly on the spot where he was murdered and a waiter came to me and asked me if my wife and daughter wanted tea . And a man from Paris that she 's never met , a man named Jean-Paul , sound technician on a documentary crew , gets her phone number from a friend of hers and calls her up one night to tell her he is blond , blue-eyed et soixante-dix centimetres de taille and that he had been going out alone before the others of his crew to a village north of Kandahar the week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their houses to throw stones at him and run him out of town because , he found out later , since he was a Westerner , an Occidental , they believed he was a certain author of a certain book dispatched by certain Satan to their certain village to pervert their place of worship and their certain faith . <p> Father father father father , she is forced to think , every tribe laments you : <p> You are the most lamented person on the planet . <p> And she tells her golden friend , her new one in New York , the one she likes to call " The Beauty , " " I ... like ... ca n't believe my old friend Mike went nuclear at me  --  I , like , ca n't believe it . " <p> " People , " Beauty tells her . <p> " That 's an answer ? " she demands . <p> " Fuck him , " Beauty says . <p> " I do n't think so  --  not until they make a condom you can slip around a friendship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> " Fuck you . " <p> " I think he thought you broke his trust . " <p> " So let 's blame Sheridan , okay ? Man shouts at me and calls down curses on my house and I am clearly on the fault line here , clearly I 'm the cause of his extreme behavior , hey . Next you 'll try to tell me , ' Try to see the man , and not his anger . ' Like it 's disembodied . Like it 's out there , orbiting , an ax somewhere , like what-the-fuck ' The Force ' in Spielberg ... " <p> " Lucas . " <p> " What 's the difference ? Like the only epic we can spin these days is ' The Lost Father ' ? " <p> " Jealous ? " <p> " Me  --  ? Of what ? " <p> " Dimensions . " <p> " Grow up : I have this theory , hey , about why women do n't need mentors . " <p> " Mentresses ... " <p> " Men-tors . Mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know ... like Hector ... ca n't say Hectress just because you feel like it ... " <p> " No , but you say Listerine . So mentorine . Go on ... " <p> " Fuck you . " <p> " ... why people of your sex do n't require mentorines ... ? " <p> " Because people of my sex tend to treat each other more like equals , across generations . Only just a theory , Beauty . Only at the ' theory ' stage . " <p> " Does n't have that ring of truth ... " <p> " Theory only , Beauty , at this stage . I 'm not about to stone you for it . " <p> Then he says , " Hey , Sheridan , do you believe the one about a woman seeks her father in the men she loves ? " and she is pressed to answer , fuck let 's face it , Beauty , you are young enough to be my son . <p> I am old enough to be your mother in some places , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , concurrent on this earth . <p> I am getting old , she thinks , I have no patience anymore for those who threaten violence , for the men who need to stand on me to cop a better view . Tired , yes , I am ; but I 'm not broken , and : <p> How did we did we ever come to this  --  penned into this repeating cycle , lulled by the familiar acts , the practice of a burdened species , failing in our thoughts our hopes our loves to be original as sin , forgetting that the sun comes up , new suck , a different day . And maybe it 's a goldfish tank , this soup we 're in , and maybe Mike and all his doubly dentured brothers are the sharks we have to swim through , maybe women are its worms and maybe God rode in the backseat of a taxi , way back when , or rode an ax to Chinatown , our waters breaking from the lip of our known element , our ordinary elements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs , our water running down God 's knees- <p> But who was driving ? <p> And , excuse me , ' scuse me , hi , would you adopt my fish- <p> Who took us in ? <p> Maybe we are goldfish in a goldfish tank in Chinatown and maybe , someday , china men will eat us ( but they 'll have to break us first ) but maybe God was driving and the person in the backseat with our elements , our history , in his lap was someone else , some golden boy , some person that she calls " The Beauty " then how did he did he have the wisdom when she asked him , or the driver asked , how did he did he have the courage when they asked him once across , at least , their three concurrent ages , how did he did he find the words to tell the woman and the Man who drove him : <p> I would rather be your lover than your Son . <p> Marianne Wiggins has published four novels , including " Separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
