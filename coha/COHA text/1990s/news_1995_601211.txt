<p> Sheree Martin has given her fifth-graders half an hour to research a topic about geographic features of America , and then to produce a skit about their choice . <p> So here stands Katelyn Mantz , 11 , making like a TV reporter for mythical News 6 , pretending to do a " remote " shot as she reports on the Carlsbad Caverns . <p> " This place in southern New Mexico where Indians used to live and hunt covers about 47,000 acres of land , " she reports into her " microphone , " a round hairbrush wrapped with cardboard . <p> Learning geography this way " is much funner " than having the teacher read it out of a book , Mantz proclaims . <p> That 's nice , you say , but lots of schools use hands-on learning to engage students . <p> What 's different here is that this setting - Academy Charter School , with 270 students - is part of a new breed of institution that education reformers on both ends of the political spectrum have come to embrace . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new charter schools , which - depending on state laws - gain varying amounts of freedom from regulations that dictate who they can hire and how they teach . In return , schools depend on their performance for their continued existence . <p> All of Academy 's teachers , for example , are on one-year contracts . If they do n't cut it , they wo n't be asked to come back , says the school 's dean , Kathy Consigli . She has the same kind of contract herself . <p> The school depends on producing academic results and happy parents : If kids leave , the money goes with them . <p> Unhappiness at Academy is not a problem yet . It has a waiting list of 500 students - for a kindergarten-seventh grade school whose home is a former supermarket next to a tanning salon and a McDonald 's . The " playground " is in a dirt lot across the street . <p> " All the parents I 've talked to were concerned that their child was falling through the cracks , and not being challenged ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Those kind of market-driven approaches - making teachers and schools perform to survive - have made charter schools the darling of conservative legislators ever since Minnesota launched the first schools in 1991 . <p> But the arrangements also appeal to Democrats and reformers , who fear an oft-mentioned alternative - vouchers that allow tax money to be spent on private schools . Many want parents to have more choice within public schools , but that can happen only if there are schools attractive enough to spur competition . <p> Enter charter schools , a movement still in its infancy but clearly on a roll . <p> As of last month , 13 states have laws allowing charter schools and 20 more states are considering such laws , says Joe Nathan , director of the Center for School Change , the University of Minnesota . More than 130 schools are up and running . <p> The schools can be designed by groups of parents , teachers and , in some cases , outside organizations . A General Accounting Office report in January said schools have used their freedom to group students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts or sciences . <p> " I 'm enormously encouraged by the variety of people around the country who have stepped forward and said , ' Yes , we 're willing to take responsibility for results , ' " Nathan says . Schools typically agree to produce certain academic results based on some form of standardized tests or parental satisfaction surveys to obtain continued funding . <p> The Academy Charter School here in Castle Rock , one of the first of the 14 already operating in Colorado , illustrates what one school did with its new-found freedom . <p> The charter law that passed in 1993 allowed Academy to hire teachers even if they do n't hold a Colorado teaching certificate . Consigli herself does n't hold the Class D certificate needed to be a principal ; thus her title of dean . <p> Parents were concerned about the lack of structure in their children 's regular curriculum in the Douglas County School District . So parents who organized Academy Charter School picked the Core Knowledge curriculum , which puts a premium on students having command of specific content , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged all math classes at the same hour of the day to allow mixed-age groupings dictated by students ' abilities . " Kids go to the class where the level of mastery is . " <p> The biggest difference , though , may be in class size , an 18-to-1 student-teacher ratio that teacher Nat Ross says means kids " get a lot more attention . " Consigli says class sizes run about 25 in the county 's other public schools . <p> How 'd they do it ? <p> " We get the same money ( as others ) , " Consigli says . " We just spend it differently . <p> " Are there trade-offs ? Yeah , " she says , gesturing with raised arms to the refurbished grocery store the kids attend . " We do n't have the amenities the public has come to expect . " <p> The school saved about $ 18,000 a year , for instance , by eschewing bus transportation in favor of parent car pools . <p> For teachers , pay is low - about $ 23,000 , close to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district average of around $ 32,500 , Consigli says . <p> " It 's not for everybody and people need to understand you ca n't have it all , " she says . <p> With charter schools often departing from the norm , it 's not surprising they 've had their share of controversies . Los Angeles school officials revoked the charter last December of the Edutrain Charter School - set up to bring dropouts back into the fold - amid allegations of fiscal mismanagement . <p> Further , a recent GAO report says various state laws may actually stifle creativity by forcing organizers to win approval of their plans from the very school districts from which they 're separating . <p> The central question remains , though , whether all these schools are meeting their purpose : raising student achievement . Experts say it 's too early to render a verdict . <p> " In terms of whether they 're actually performing better , I do n't think we can say that , " says Frank Newman , president of the Education Commission of the States . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school bureaucracies to be more responsive to their customers - the parents . <p> In states where people can appeal to the state board if a local school board wo n't approve their charter idea , local districts have responded by allowing new kinds of schools to be created , Nathan says . In Forest Lake , Minn. , for instance , the school board said no to parents who wanted to start a Montessori school , but then created such a school of its own . <p> " Has it made it more flexible ? " Newman says . " It 's hard to prove , but I think the answer to that is yes . " <p> Nathan also believes there 's anecdotal evidence that charter schools are helping kids who do n't succeed elsewhere . <p> " One thing that 's very good about charter schools is their existence does n't depend on anecdotes , " Nathan says . " If they do n't ( achieve results ) , the schools close . " <p> Charter Schools <p> About charter schools : <p>  --  They 're public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents , teachers or other organizations , depending on what state laws allow . <p> Charter schools are freed from many state regulations , and agree to be judged by their student performance on state or standardized tests . <p> Where they are : <p>  --  States allowing charter schools : Alaska , Arizona , California , Colorado , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Hawaii , Georgia , Kansas , New Mexico , Wisconsin and Wyoming . <p> Another 20 states are considering adopting their own charter school laws .
