// Get them at their peak ! Now 's the time to stop at your local farm stand or market for some juicy berries . Berries come early in summer 's fruit line-up .

Best of all , you can sit yourself down and eat your fill with abandon since calories are almost nonexistent in berries .

Some are elegant , like our fresh Mixed Berry Tart , which happily layers strawberries , raspberries and blueberries over a flaky , tender crust topped with vanilla pastry cream .
