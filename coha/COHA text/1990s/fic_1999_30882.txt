Chapter One : This Is a Love Story This is a love story like every love story I had always known , like no love story I could ever have imagined . It 's everything beautiful  --  bright colors , candle-scented rooms , orange silk , and lavender amethyst . It 's everything grotesque , disfigured . It 's long twisting wounds , open and unhealed , nerves pricked raw , exposed . This is a love story , awake and alive . It 's a breathing document , a living witness . It 's human possibility , hope , and connection . It 's a gathering of Spirit , the claiming of dreams . It 's an Alvin Ailey dance , a rainbow roun ' mah shoulder . It 's a freedom song , a 12-string guitar , a Delta blues song . This story is a reprieve . This is a love story , threadbare and used up , yet sometimes fat , weighty , stretched out of shape . It 's polyester , this story , man-made , trying to be pretty , not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself together . This is a story with patches in the knees . This is a love story , my love story and thousands of other women 's love story . It 's a story that 's known , documented , photographed , videotaped , audiotaped , filed , photocopied , watched over , studied , caricatured , questioned , researched , and noted . This is a love story . It 's the one we keep close , sheltering it from judgment . It 's lovers denied at family dinners and at office parties . It 's secret glances at Polaroid pictures . It 's whispered names . This is a story hidden within midnight bus rides and 5:00 A.M. van rides , behind metal detectors , electronic doors , and steel slamming against steel . This is a love story , the one not generally discussed in polite or even public conversation.But if there 's one thing that I do know about myself , it 's that I know I hate secrets , that secrets mean shame , and that I am not now , nor will I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved someone , and that someone loved me . And even though so many people have asked me if I have lost my mind , if I am lonely , or desperate . Even though so many people have wondered if I was having a crisis , or determined that I was just going through a phase , I will continue loving the man I am loving . I will love him even though he 's got an ugly past , skeletons , and sorrow . Even though he does n't have a great job or position or power , and even though he 's a prisoner at a maximum-security correctional facility , which my husband , Rashid , is , I will continue loving him . And this is our story . The first time I ever went into a prison , it was for a class I was taking on the relationship between Black people and incarceration in the United States . Months later , long after final exams had been taken and grades received , my former professor called me and asked if I would come with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correctional Facility in upstate New York . It was just about eighty miles from Brooklyn , where I lived . He wanted me , he said , to participate in a Black History Month program . Do n't you write poems ? he asked . You could read your poetry , he said . I agreed and we all went to do the program , and this was how we met , Rashid and I , convict and student , gangster and poet , resident host and visiting performer . Rashid is fine as hell , which I tried not to but could n't help noticing the very first time I saw him . He looks like this beautifully symmetrical collaboration between Africa and India . He is n't huge , not an overwhelming presence , contrary to the usual celluloid interpretation of Black prisoners . Rashid is 5 ' 7 " , with a brave smile and bright eyes . He is , I remember thinking this then , just the right size , and I could look directly at him , nearly eye to eye . His voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplanted Afro-Caribbean . Where are you from ? I wanted to know . The Boogie Down , he responded , meaning the South Bronx . And before ? Oh , oh , he said , understanding my question . Guyana . South America . It 's the most beautiful place in the world . That 's a hell of a thing in one life , huh ? To have seen the most beautiful place in the world and the most horrible place . And I 'm not even thirty yet ! After that , a number of other men came over to me to tell me how much they enjoyed my performance , and would I be willing to read their work , when was I coming back up , could they write to me to discuss poetry , did I know I reminded them of this sister they used to know back in the day ? In the midst of these questions , Rashid left me . I watched him as he walked across the huge auditorium where the program was being held . He weaved easily through the nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the stage , the back of it , and found another guest to talk to , a poet like me . A very talented poet , I should say , and a very attractive one . I waited for him to come back over to me . I tried to will him to come back over to me , but finally I was left there annoyed because Rashid did not return until it was time to say good-bye . After we were in love , Rashid would tell me that it was me , my fault , that I was hard to approach . He told me that while I was an animated and exciting performer , offstage I was quiet , withdrawn , cool and distant . Besides , he admits now , through a series of childlike giggles , every dude knows when you really want to talk to a sister , you do n't step to her directly . You step to her friend , and that 's what I did . I talked to that other sister , the poet who performed before you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , what I 'd look like trying to talk to you when all of them other dudes were running they game on you ? You know what I 'm saying ? Rashid is so pleased with himself as he tells me this story five years after our first encounter . After all , in the moment of his confession , we are in a visiting room , and I lie , as fitted as possible , in the crook of his arms . And in that moment , despite every hurting and hell I have had to endure to love this man , there is no other place that I would rather be . When we began , I was twenty-five , a student and organizer , a wife on the verge of divorce from my first husband , a poet full of secrets and sadness , an emerging woman hampered by insecurities and anger , a human being fighting off loneliness while craving solitude , needing an open love , long honest discussions , a quiet touching at my core . When we began , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years with life on the back , a model prisoner , a program coordinator , the father of a nine-year-old boy he had never been able to raise , a lawyer without a law degree , a devoted Muslim , a man on the verge of divorce from his first wife , a human being fighting off loneliness while craving solitude , needing an open love , long honest discussions , a quiet touching at his core . We were exactly the same and we were completely different . We were never meant to be together . We were always meant to save each other .
