<p> As we celebrate the creation of the Child Care Bureau and its role in promoting good quality child care across the country , it is time to think together about how we can best promote partnerships between providers and parents . A key to good quality , these partnerships serve to build bridges for children between their worlds of home and child care , helping them feel safe , secure , and happy in both places . <p> By building a good working partnership , early childhood professionals and parents ( or other primary adults in a family who care for a child ) can help assure that child care is the best it can be for the children in their lives . Yet this is easier said than done . Sharing the care of young children evokes deep , often conflicting and painful feelings of the adults involved that can get in the way of their working together . And there is too little training available for professionals  --  and none for parents  --  about why such a partnership is critical and how to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and parents can and do work . Many early childhood programs have demonstrated this over the past several years . The challenge we face now is to foster good working partnerships between providers and parents in all child care settings . <p> A first step in meeting this challenge is to ask , What do both providers and parents need to know to get their relationship off to a good start and make it work ? Though every provider-parent relationship is unique because every provider , parent , and child is unique , I suggest that there is a basic core of knowledge that can be useful in most situations and that this core should include the information that follows . How a good working relationship benefits a child <p> A good working relationship between providers and parents serves as the foundation of a child 's experience in child care . Only by working together can a child 's adults provide the continuity a child needs to feel safe and secure when she is away from home . <p> Providers and parents come to their relationship with different sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each will get a more complete picture of a child and thus be better able to respond to and meet a child 's needs . Parents are specialists about their child . They know that their child likes apples better than oranges , that she falls asleep on her tummy , and that lately she is afraid of dogs . Professionals have an overview of children based on their experience of working with many unrelated children . They know patterns of child development . <p> For example , they know that it is hard for toddlers to share and that preschoolers sometimes get confused about what is real and what is fantasy . Parents ' knowledge can help a provider tune into the special qualities of an individual child . Professionals ' knowledge can help parents understand their child in terms of a broad spectrum of development . <p> In addition , providers and parents can be there for each other . They can share the excitement of such new accomplishments of the child as drinking from a cup or writing her name , and can support one another when facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's illness . Raising a child can be a lonely , scary business . By reinforcing one another , providers and parents help assure they will each feel more strengthened and thus will be better able to support the children they each care for . Who is who in a child 's life <p> It is common for providers and parents to blur their roles because they both perform such caregiving activities as dressing , feeding , playing with and so forth . However , children know who is who . The adults who care for them need to know too . <p> Parents are a child 's most important people . No one , no matter how well trained or skilled , can take their place in a child 's life . Parents ' relationships with a child are forever- across the years and miles . A child trusts her parents more deeply than her providers . She knows they are there for her no matter what she does or feels . She is her happiest , silliest , saddest , and most defiant with them . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reason most parents have at one time or another arrived at child care to be greeted by a crying child . Spending the day in a group setting can be hard work . A child may be tired from a skipped nap or upset about something that happened during the day . When her parents arrive at the end of the day , she feels safe . Her emotions may overwhelm her . <p> Though a provider 's relationship is fleeting compared to that of a parent , the relationship a provider and child form is meaningful and can have a strong and lasting influence . When a provider is there for a child  --  to help her if she gets stuck rolling over , to help her flip pancakes being made for a snack  --  a provider develops a trusting relationship with the child that lets her know she can count on other people . And because a provider may be more objective , she can more easily give a child room to try out a new skill  --  such as buttoning her coat or walking along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exerting undue pressure on the child to succeed . How to keep feelings about sharing care from interfering with supporting a child <p> If two parents of the same child have complicated feelings about sharing the care of their child  --  feelings of doubt and inadequacy , jealousy , guilt , and resentment  --  it is no wonder that providers and parents can have complex feelings too . These feelings are to be expected . They are normal and sometimes painful reactions that are rooted in the deep attachment both providers and parents have for a child  --  an attachment all children need . <p> Knowing that these feelings go hand-in-hand with sharing care means that providers and parents do n't need to worry that something is wrong when they experience them . They do n't have to feel embarrassed either . Rather than trying to conceal their feelings , which is a common response , providers and parents can examine them . They may find it helpful to discuss what they are feeling with family members , friends , colleagues , or with each other . The challenge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . Recognizing these emotions for what they are will prevent them from being misplaced or misunderstood or interfering with the creation by parents and providers of a good working relationship that children need them to have . How to communicate effectively <p> Although sharing information can be difficult , the difficulty usually does not arise from the information itself . Some of the most troublesome situations can develop when information is overlaid with self-doubt and worry . For example , a parent may worry that she appears incompetent because her child does n't sleep through the night . A provider may worry that she will be perceived as an inadequate provider if she admits to being frustrated and not knowing how to help a child stop hitting . <p> It can be helpful for both providers and parents to acknowledge up front that no one knows all the answers when it comes to childbearing . Even in cases when there is a clear-cut answer , the question usually changes as a child moves on to another stage and a new answer is needed . It is okay for parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers . In fact , only by sharing their questions will providers and parents learn to pool their information , to brainstorm , to seek information and advice from other sources , and ultimately , to develop the solid problem-solving skills they will need as long as they share their lives with children . And finally . . . how to resolve differences <p> As they share the care of a child , providers and parents are sure to disagree . In and of themselves , these differences of opinion will not be harmful to children . Children do n't need their adults to have friction-free relationships . But they do n't need to be caught in the middle of conflicts either . Conflicts are a sign that provider and parent need to work together more closely . The primary responsibility of providers and parents is to not only find a resolution to their conflicts but to keep children 's needs in the forefront and prevent a disruption in the partnerships they have developed . <p> When it comes to resolving conflicts , there are few absolutes . What works for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the solution in another situation . A conflict for one provider and parent may not be a conflict for another . It 's a personal call . But providers and parents can gain helpful insights by examining how others handle their differences . <p> Here are three basic options that providers and parents often consider when faced with a conflict : <p> Providers and parents may decide not to make an issue of a situation they do n't like or about which they disagree . In such cases , providers and parents may conclude that an issue just is n't worth the fuss when they examine it in the context of a child 's whole life . They find their own resolutions . <p> For example , though Karla 's father may wish the television was on less at the provider 's home , he is pleased that Karla is involved in many interesting and enjoyable activities and may ignore the issue of TV watching . When a provider feels that Roberto 's parents are too overpowering , she may step back and notice how much love and confidence they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she may do things differently . <p> Providers and parents may decide to confront an area of disagreement . Some disagreements can be resolved easily and immediately if one party takes some action or makes a change . For example , a mother may come in early one morning to help the teacher move a fish tank to a safer place . Or providers may agree to launder sheets weekly instead of laundering every other week . <p> Other disagreements are more complex . These will take more time and effort to resolve and may require the willingness of both provider and parent to compromise . <p> Finally , there are times when a provider or parent realizes a situation can not work out and ends their relationship . Though changing care arrangements is disruptive , there are instances when it is the only solution . <p> Young children in child care depend on their adults to help them feel safe by building bridges between child care and home . Yet providers and parents need information about how to work together . This article is one small step in identifying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The more we talk together about how to build good working partnerships in child care , the more likely it is that there will be good working partnerships  --  and the better it will be for the children in our lives . <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Sharing the care <p> By Amy Laura Dombro <p> <p> Amy Laura Dombro is an infant/toddler specialist based in New York .
