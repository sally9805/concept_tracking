Paul Weyrich , an influential molder of social-conservative opinion , wrote his followers that the public 's disinclination to throw Bill Clinton out of office reflected " the collapse of the culture . " At first I thought he was being a bit harsh . Then Levi Strauss announced that it 's laying off a good chunk of its work force , partly because so many Americans have abandoned authentic blue jeans for designer jeans . That gave me a little more appreciation of what Weyrich was getting at . All of us with an interest in preserving Western civilization have our own notion of what just might be the last straw . <P> Years ago , I put on the record what I had learned about blue jeans at Southwest High School , in Kansas City , Mo. : " Anybody who wears jeans that are not Levi or Lee is a nerd , a creep , a wonk , and walks like a duck . " What binds Weyrich and me together , I realized , is that we believe in an absolute standard of behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we deplore what he would probably call relativist morals and I would call a lot of people being willing to go around dressed like dorks . <P> We both take pride in ignoring the fashions of the times . My wife often tells me that my views on blue jeans are adolescent . That should come as no surprise , I reply , since I acquired them during my adolescence . I have never seen any reason to change them . Anyone looking for a relativist position on blue jeans can look elsewhere . <P> Weyrich , who says he was the one who invented the phrase moral majority , has concluded from the recent unpleasantness that people who believe what he believes are no longer in the majority , and that their only choice is to drop out of a culture that has become an " ever wider sewer . " <P> Here 's where our approaches differ . I 've known for a long time that people who adhere to the Southwest High School verities are no longer in the majority . Anytime I go to the movies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deviationists are thick on the ground . I go anyway ; I like movies . I confine my comments on the other moviegoers to some grumbling heard only by my wife . I 'm confident that I 'm personally invulnerable to the charms of Calvin KIein or Tommy Hilfiger , but I 'm not up to telling other people how to dress . <P> The Moral Majority was never a majority . A majority of Americans are unwilling to have Paul Weyrich or anybody else dictate to them what is moral and righteous in personal life . In 1992 , when the morals police and gay bashers seemed in ascendancy at the Republican National Convention , the public response was so negative that George Bush had to spend the first couple of weeks of the campaign backpedaling . <P> If Lucianne Goldberg and Linda Tripp and those squirrely lawyers from the Federalist Society had remembered that , they might have realized that they were about to bring nothing but frustration to Paul Weyrich , not to speak of the Republican Party . Instead they must have whooped with joy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's Friday , dress-down day in the law firms , and the Federalist Society lawyers are all wearing designer jeans .
