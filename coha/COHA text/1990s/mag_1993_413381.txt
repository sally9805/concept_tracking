Investing will never be a completely worry-free endeavor , but these days the anxiety is running especially high . More than two years into an alleged recovery , the economy is still staggering , inflation is once again rumbling ominously and market indexes are trading at prices so lofty that many pros warn that stocks are cruising for a 10% to 20% fall . Yet even in forbidding markets , there are opportunities to profit . The goal of this article is to help you find those opportunities . To that end , we canvassed more than two dozen financial planners , money managers and securities analysts and challenged them to name their favorite investment today . We also profiled three families at different financial stages and asked top planners to recommend the best moves the families could make to realize their investment goals . Not surprisingly , the pros ' specific recommendations differed . But they consistently stressed the importance of diversification and a patient search for investments with undiscovered promise  --  two touchstones of prudent investing in any market . With those principles in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you are starting out with $1,000 , spreading your risks with $5,000 or jazzing up a six-figure portfolio with a strategic $10,000 move . $1,000 An investment that promises a guaranteed 18% today sounds too good to be true . But wiping out a $1,000 credit-card balance that costs you 18% interest is the same as earning 18% . So before you plunge a grand into stocks or mutual funds , check your credit cards or other high-rate unsecured loans . The tactic has another advantage for young investors like Michelle and Cliff Wright of Portland , Ore . ( profiled on the opposite page ) : By getting out from under installment debt , you can free up income for a monthly saving program . And over a lifetime , getting into the habit of investing regularly will matter much more than where you put your first grand . Another investment to attend to first is a cash reserve to protect against being laid up  --  or laid off . Knoxville financial planner P. Kemp Fain advises stashing away money equal to three to six months of your net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-solid choices : United Services Government Securities Saving , recently yielding 3.4% , and Strong Money Market , yielding 2.8% . For high-bracket investors , a tax-exempt money fund such as Kemper Tax-Exempt may make even more sense . Kemper recently paid a tax-free 2.4% , the equivalent of a 3.5% taxable yield for investors in the 31% federal bracket . Once you have cleared up your high-cost debt and squirreled away a cash reserve , you can start to build the core of a long-term portfolio with so-called total-return mutual funds , which control risk by blending stocks with less volatile income investments such as bonds . For risk-shy investors , Philadelphia financial planner Neil B. Kauffman likes $837 million USAA Mutual Income Stock , which has returned an annualized 14.8% since 1988 . The fund specializes in conservative stocks yielding more than the S &P's; 2.7% . ( The fund is sold directly by its sponsor to investors without a sales charge , as are all funds in this story unless otherwise noted . For phone numbers and more portfolio data , see the accompanying tables . ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Fidelity Asset Manager , which has returned 17.4% annually over the past three years . The fund recently held 49% of its assets in high-quality growth stocks , 35% in government and corporate bonds and 16% in cash . ( Although the fund 's minimum initial purchase is $2,500 , you can open an Individual Retirement Account for as little as %500 . ) One final pick : $768 million SoGen International . Despite its name , the fund is less an overseas stock choice than a highly diversified total-return portfolio . Recently , it held 46% of its assets in foreign and domestic stocks , 26% in cash , 17% in bonds and 11% in convertible securities . The fund 's 14.5% annual returns over the past decade more than made up for its 3.75% sales charge . If you are willing to take higher risk in pursuit of more generous returns , you might prefer a fund that invests purely in equities . Given the lofty levels of today 's stock indexes , you should continue your search to portfolios that follow what is called a value-oriented investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they think are trading below their intrinsic worth as measured by their assets or earnings , an approach that often thrives when the markets are at the high end of their price range . Don Phillips , vice president of the mutual fund research firm Morningstar Inc. , leans toward $739 million Gabelli Asset . This fund 's manager , the renowned stock picker Mario Gabelli , focuses on companies whose total market value is below what he thinks the business would be worth in a private buy-out . Gabelli 's enviable record : 13.6% annualized returns over the past five years . Another top choice is MainStay Value . Fund manager Denis Laplaige picks only from the cheapest 20% of the 2,000 or so stocks he follows , based on ratios of stock price to earnings and cash flow . The fund 's 16.7% annualized returns over the past five years make the fund worth a look despite a sales loan on withdrawals that can run as high as 5% . Finally , you might try $477 million Selected American Shares , which has returned 14.3% over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies that he believes have stronger earnings potential than Wall Street generally recognizes . If you might need you money back in less than three to five years  --  which means that even a total-return fund is too dicey-consider a bond fund . For cautious investors , money manager Earl Osborn , a principal at the San Francisco money-management firm Bingham Osborn Scarborough , recommends $2.9 billion Scudder Short-Term Bond , up 9.9% annually since 1983 . You can get higher returns by choosing intermediate bond funds , but remember : The longer the fund 's average maturity , the more it will sink in price if interest rates move up . Although some rate increase is likely over the next few years , Osborn thinks that intermediates ' higher yields compensate investors for the greater risk of price declines . His picks : $282 million Columbia Fixed Income Securities , up an annualized 11.5% over the past five years , and $157 million Babson Bond L , up 11.1%. $5,000 If you have already assembled a core portfolio of high-quality U.S. stock and bond funds and you are looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 25% of you equity holdings in foreign markets will cut your losses if U.S. shares tumble this summer as many analysts fear . Burnie Sparks , president of the private client group at San Mateo , Calif. investment firm Bailard Biehl &; Kaiser , singles out three internationals . The $1.3 billion Harbor International ( up an annualized 15% in the past five years ) has nearly 80% of its assets in a blend of underpriced European stocks and fast-growing companies in emerging Asian markets like South Korea and Malaysia . The managers of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price International Stock ( up 16.8% a year since 1983 ) are likewise optimistic about Europe and the smaller Asian economies committing 68% of fund assets to those regions . The veteran $1.3 billion Scudder International ( up nearly 16% a year in the past 10 years ) has a similar mix but also is betting 25% of its assets on Japan 's nascent market recovery . For more on Japan 's outlook , see Fund Watch on page 43 . ) If you have already diversified overseas , you might consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts predict that small firms will outperform their larger brethren over the next three years . " When small caps get the edge , they usually hold their lead for six years , " says Claudia Mott , Prudential Securities ' small-cap analyst . " So we may be only halfway through this cycle . " Sheldon Jacobs , editor of the newsletter No-Load Fund Investor , likes Fidelity OTC for IRA investors , for whom the fund waives its usual 3% sales charge . This $1.3 billion titan has had 16.9% average annual returns in the past five years at 88% of the risk of the typical stock fund . Another Jacobs pick : $104 million Neuberger &; Berman Genesis , up 13.3% annually over the past three years . The fund moderates risk by diversifying its small-cap holdings over more than 100 issues . Remember , though , that both internationals and small-cap funds are chancier than the average domestic equity fund . Such funds are appropriate for investors like Gary and Carole Cottingham of Elgin , Ill. ( profiled on page 76 ) , who want to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the funds are far too unpredictable in the short term to be a source of funds for , say , their teenage sons ' college tuition . With $5,000 in hand , you can also consider individual stocks , since that sum allows you to buy in cost-efficient lots of 100 shares . Brokerage commissions on these so-called round lots run about 2.5% . Smaller odd lots may add as much as one percentage point to your costs . Tom Schlesinger , equity strategist for the St. Louis brokerage A.G. Edwards , advises stock investors to concentrate on firms whose share prices have been unjustly beaten down . His favorites include top drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb ( estimated 1993 revenues : $11.5 billion ; ticker symbol : BMY ; recently traded on the New York Stock Exchange for $60 ) and $8.5 billion American Home Products ( AHP ; NYSE , $66.50 ) , whose share prices have dropped in what Schlesinger thinks is an overreaction to the Clintons ' health-care-reform rhetoric . Schlesinger also likes food companies such as $6.9 billion H.J. Heinz ( HNZ ; NYSE , $38.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped 14% since March , as part of an indiscriminate sell-off of brand-name consumer companies . ( For other promising consumer stocks , see page 58 . ) John Dessauer , publisher of Dessauer 's Journal of Financial Markets , leans toward fast-growing small-company stocks , like $253 million ShowBiz Pizza Time ( SHBZ ; recently traded over the counter for $33 ) . Dessauer expects profits at the company , which operates the Chuck E. Cheese chain of restaurants , to grow by 35% next year and more than 20% annually over the next five years . Another Dessauer pick : $174 million SEI Corp . ( SEIC ; OTC , $32.25 ) , which supplies investment performance evaluation services to money managers and administrative services to bank trust departments . He thinks the company 's earnings will grow at a 15% annual clip through 1998. $10,000 If you are weighing how to invest five-figure sums , chances are you already have a tidy nest egg and may merely want to shift assets around to better suit your goals . That 's the case for Francis and Beverly Berlin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio to throw off more income to supplement the $40,000 they currently get from Social Security , Francis ' pension and stock and mutual fund dividends . Equally important , however , is safety . " I do n't want to go overboard with risky investments , " says Francis . For investors like the Berlins , manager Osborn suggests a conservative municipal bond fund such as $1.4 billion Vanguard Municipal-Limited Term ( up 8.2% annually since 1990 ) . The fund 's recent yield of 4.6% equates to a generous 6.4% on a taxable investment for investors in the 28% federal tax bracket . For a return that includes income plus modest capital appreciation , Osborn also likes $4.3 billion Vanguard Wellesley Income , which currently has 63% of assets in bonds and the remainder in stocks and cash . The fund has returned an annualized 13.8% over the past decade . For investors willing to take more risk , the stocks known as real estate investment trust , or REITs , offer high yields and a shot at capital appreciation . Operating a bit like mutual funds , REITs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the real estate slump of the late 1980s , REIT prices have rebounded 68% since 1990 . Robert Frank , REIT analyst for the Baltimore investment bank Alex . Brown &; Sons , expects the rally to last another three to five years as the shell-shocked property market continues to improve . Among Frank 's current favorites : United Dominion Realty Trust ( UDR ; NYSE , $13.25 ) , which owns apartment complexes in the Southeast ; Developers Diversified Realty Corp . ( DDR ; NYSE , $25.75 ) , which operates 56 shopping centers in the Midwest and Southeast ; Weingarten Real Investors ( WRI ; NYSE , $39.75 ) , which owns apartment complexes in the South ; and Health Care Property Investors ( HCP ; NYSE , $28.25 ) , which operates long-term-care and rehabilitation centers in 30 states . If you are willing to take a flier with 10% of your portfolio or so , you might consider loading up on three or more single-country closed-end funds . These are essentially mutual funds whose shares are traded on an exchange like a stock and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed-end fund analyst Michael Porter favors funds whose shares are trading at or below the net asset value of the underlying portfolio . In Europe he suggests Growth Fund of Spain ( New York Stock Exchange , $9.50 ) , which recently traded at a 3% discount . Among emerging markets , Porter likes First Philippine ( NYSE , $12.75 ) , which recently traded at a 15% discount , and the Argentina Fund ( NYSE , $10.75 ) . The latter traded at a premium of as much as 30% in the fall of 1991 but has recently sunk to 10% above par . While that is a steeper premium than Porter normally likes to pay , he thinks the fund could soar again as the Argentine economy clips along at a 4% to 5% growth pace over the next few years . If you prefer to research individual companies rather than bet on whole markets , think about investing in individual foreign stocks that trade on American exchanges as ADRs ( American Depositary Receipts ) . Vivian Lewis , editor of the newsletter Global Investing , likes the $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; NYSE ; $46.75 ) . Lewis expects earnings to grow at a 12% to 15% annual rate as the Spanish economy emerges from recession late this year or early in 1994 . She is also high on the $31 billion telecommunications leader Alcatel Alsthom ( ALA : NYSE , $23.25 ) , France 's second largest company . As France emerges from recession , the company ' stock could rise by as much as 25% over the next 18 months . Newsletter editor Dessauer fancies another telecommunications giant , $5.9 billion Cable &; Wireless ( CWP ; NYSE , $34.75 ) . The company 's Mercury division  --  the British equivalent to MCI  --  has secured 20% of the British phone traffic to the U.S. , Germany and France , as well as 30% of calls to Japan . Dessauer thinks the company 's shares will shoot up 25% by the end of this year . He expects almost as much gain from $39 billion Nestle , the world 's largest food company . Dessauer expects the Swiss giant 's shares to rise 20% by the end of 1993 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter in the U.S. , but Dessauer expects the Nestle ADRs to list on the New York Stock Exchange within a few months . Most important , perhaps , Nestle derives just 2% of its sales from its home country , with the rest coming quite literally from around the world . With the outlook for stocks so uncertain today , an investment that can spread your risks around the globe may be the smartest bet of all . GETTING STARTED Michelle and Cliff Wright After two years of marriage , this young Portland , Ore . couple have finally pushed their bank account balance above $1,000 . Until about six months ago , when they began putting aside $200 a month from their $61,000 joint income  --  Cliff , 27 , a credit manager for a sod and grass-seed company and Michelle , 26 , an advertising director for a chain of retail stores  --  they were in a spending , not a saving , mode . " We had money to play with for the first time after being starving students , " explains Cliff , a tad sheepishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home within two years . They figure they will need to come up with roughly $15,000 to cover the up-front costs needed to close on a $100,000 starter home . That 's why they are eager to get their $1,000 into investments that could earn high returns . " We 're young and can make back any losses , " says Cliff , " so why not take a chance ? " THE ADVICE Increasing their savings will do Michelle and Cliff more good than knock-it-out-of-the-part investing . But to find the money to save , they need to pay down debt . Currently , loan payments eat up about 10% of their gross income , twice the level that MONEY experts think is appropriate . Also , though the Wrights are willing to take risks , they should n't . Their two-year target for buying a house allows them no time for missteps . Carl Camp point out that if they can put aside $500 a month  --  about 10% of their gross income  --  it would take only two months longer to save $15,000 in an investment earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 ) . His suggestion : Put that $1,000 in a money-market fund such as one of those recommended in the table opposite . The money fund can then do double duty as an emergency reserve and , eventually , as a down payment fund . EYE ON A PRIZE Vivian and Javier Reyes Like all new parents , the Reyes of Coral Gables , Fla. have big plans for their newborn . Among them : The couple want three-month-old Sarah Isabel to have her pick of colleges when the time comes , regardless of cost . " If Sarah turns out to have a lot of ability , we want her to be able to go anywhere , " says Javier . That could be expensive . Assuming that inflation in college costs continues at a 6% annual rate , a four-year private college education may cost more than $200,000 by the time Sarah is 18 , and even a public university could run more than $80,000 . The Reyes plan to launch their savings marathon out of the $85,000 that Javier , 31 , earns as a C.P.A. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up speed when Vivian , who has a law degree , starts to practice this fall . The Reyes have started to plan how they will invest . For maximum growth , they are eyeing aggressive equity funds . The couple figure that they can start with an investment of $1,000 to $2,500 . Thereafter , they plan to contribute a steady $100 a month . THE ADVICE Financial planner Carl Camp suggests that the Reyes start out a little slower , honing their investing skills with a total-return fund , a moderate-risk blend of stocks and income investments . ( In the table on page 72 , we nominate three such funds available for $1,000 or less . ) As their portfolio grows , the Reyes can then put additional savings into riskier choices , such as an international equity fund . Charleston , S.C . financial planner William Prewitt points out that a solid overseas stock fund would actually dampen the risk of a portfolio concentrated in purely domestic funds , since world markets tend not to rise or fall all at once . ( We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose , the Reyes will have to feed it more than $100 a month . To amass the $200,000 they need to assure Sarah complete freedom of choice , the Reyes should figure on putting away at least $250 a month . SECURITY DOWN THE ROAD Gary and Carole Cottingham Gary and Carole Cottingham , both 43 , are facing a financial dilemma that is painfully familiar to most parents of teenagers : how to simultaneously pay for their children 's college education and also save for their own retirement . ( The couple 's picture appears at right below . ) So far the Elgin , Ill. couple have devoted most of their efforts to the first goal  --  and with considerable success . They have $39,400 put away to pay college bills for 17-year-old Marc , who enters his last year of high school this fall . That money is invested in two tax free bond funds , Fidelity Limited Term Municipal Bond , yielding 5.9% , and Nuveen Municipal Bond , yielding 5.7% . Meanwhile , 14-year-old Steven has a $33,000 college nest egg invested in Income Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has returned 14.7% annually over the past three years . Now the Cottinghams are ready to turn their attention to their own future , and with retirement as little as 20 years away , they must make up for lost time . So far their retirement fund consists solely of $28,000 in an IRA invested in Investment Co. of America , a moderate-risk growth and income fund . But the couple 's joint salary of $135,000  --  Gary a civil engineer and Carole an X-ray technician  --  gives then the cash flow to begin some serious saving . Moreover , says Gary , " We 're at a point where we have a base of investments and investing experience . Now as we begin retirement planning we can become more aggressive . " THE ADVICE Financial planner Carl Camp agrees that the Cottingham 's current IRA makes a solid core holding for a retirement portfolio and suggests that they now diversify with an international fund such as Harbor International and a small-company fund , such as FAM Value ( no load ; $2,000 minimum ; 800-932-3271 ) , which has gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will find further top picks in both categories in the table opposite . ) Because they are staring late , Camp says the couple should figure on putting away at least 15% of their income  --  or $1,700 a month  --  to create an adequate retirement pool by the time they reach 65 . <p>
