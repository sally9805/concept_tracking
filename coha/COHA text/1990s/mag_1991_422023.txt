<p> About 40 years ago a European yellowjacket species , Vespula germanica , was accidentally introduced into the northeastern United States . The wasp found the North American environment agreeable , and it prospered . The existence of this new yellowjacket species in the Northeast was undetected for several years because of its similarity to the six species of yellowjackets native to New York State . <p> We have nicknamed the new yellowjacket " the picnic wasp ' because it likes many of the foods we enjoy , particularly during the summer months  --  hot dogs , hamburgers , potato salad , soda and beer . Yellowlackets have always been common around picnic tables , but in the early 1970s the problem suddenly grew more serious . A survey we conducted revealed that 80 percent of the wasps we collected around garbage cans , in parks and at picnic tables were Vespula germanica , the new species . In short , picnic wasps have become serious pests . <p> One October a representative from a major food chain telephoned and asked me how to get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was concerned that these " bees " might sting customers or store employees who placed returned cans and bottles into dumpsters or those picking up the dumpsters for transport to the landfill . The only humor in this conversation was that the gentleman referred to these insects as bees . Yellowjackets , of course , are not bees , and after his fourth reference to the bees , we took time to discuss the difference . <p> One of the chief differences between bees and wasps is that bees feed almost exclusively on pollen and nectar . On rare occasions , especially in dry weather , bees may be found on ripe fruits that have broken open or whose skins are ruptured from wasp feeding . But bees are not interested in our picnic foods . <p> I had another more serious conversation with a county agent who had received complaints about yellowjackets from several owners of roadside stands . The fresh fruits , especially those with strong odors or broken skins , were especially attractive to these wasps . Not only were the proprietors concerned about their customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food with an insect . A third group with a special concern consisted of concessionaires selling soft drinks at the Cornell football field . Yellowjacket Life History <p> The life histories of the wasps we call yellowjackets are similar . Their nests are started in the spring , usually in May , by a single female that has mated the previous fall . She builds the first cells in the comb , using bits of decaying wood that she chews and manipulates into place with her mandibles . She lays the first eggs and collects all of the food  --  usually other insects  --  to feed her young . The first brood consists of six to 12 individuals . When they emerge , several weeks after the eggs are laid , they begin to forage , and the mother of the colony retires from her food gathering activities to lay eggs full time . The first wasps that are produced are usually smaller than their sisters that follow . <p> If the nest is successful , the population continues to grow , and by August or September several thousand yellowjackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new queens and males are produced . Mating takes place in the fall , the males die and the fertilized female queens overwinter as individuals in the ground , under bark or stones or in suitable crevices where they are well protected from predators . The nests are not reused , but are abandoned in the fall , usually by September . However , if a nest is well protected alongside a warm house , for example , the nest may be active until November or even into early December . <p> Some yellowjacket species build their nests in the ground , under large rocks , in fallen trees or in piles of abandoned wood . Others prefer to nest above ground in tree cavities , stone walls or the sides of houses . Vespula germanica prefers houses and often chooses older homes . In some parts of the city of Ithaca , for example , at least one nest may be found in every city block . Because this species likes both our homes and our food , it is more populous in cities than in rural areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the numbers in a given area , but one must be very careful when attempting to destroy a nest . Night is the safest time . Yellowjackets are extremely sensitive to vibrations , land if one walks near an underground or aerial nest , the wasps may crawl out of the entrance , wait for the interloper to come close enough and sting him or her . It is safest to approach the nest when the weather is cool . Interestingly , when the nests contain only a few individuals , they retreat rather than attack . I have known several instances where yellowjackets have built a nest in a lawn , which was mowed weekly from May through July . People have not believed me when I have told them that the nest from which they were attacked had been established for several months . <p> Many companies manufacture aerosol insecticides that are very effective . To kill all the brood in a nest , one must spray well inside the nest and in contact with the wasps . Controlling Yellowjackets <p> At present we have no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our only recommendation for owners of roadside stands is that they screen their premises . Some people screen off their picnic areas . <p> Picking up and eliminating refuse and garbage , is helpful . Garbage cans should be kept tightly covered . I have observed , however , that yellowjackets are such effective foragers that they appear almost immediately when food is brought out . <p> Both because yellowjackets are social insects with interesting life histories and because they are pests , several researchers are studying the yellowjackets ' life history with the hope of producing effective methods of reducing and controlling this nuisance species . Nevertheless yellowjackets are important in maintaining a balance of nature . Because they capture other insects to feed their young , they reduce the number of other pests in an area . <p> The best defense against yellowjackets is to avoid the places where they are active . If one must go near them , the best protection is proper clothing . <p> CARTOON <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Yellowjacket embryos <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A close-up of yellowlackets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Morse is a professor of entomology and apiculture at Cornell University and a long-time contributor to the conservationist . <p> How to Avoid Being Stung <p> If you are afraid of stinging insects , or more importantly if you may be allergic to them , here are some simple rules to follow to avoid being stung . Wear light-colored , smooth-finished clothes . Stinging insects are much less inclined to sting through this type of clothing . Beekeepers avoid too many stings by wearing white cotton coveralls or khaki pants and shirts . It is especially important not to wear wool , leather or suede when stinging insects are active . Do n't wear hair spray , lotions , perfumes or other sweet-smelling scents that may attract stinging insects . Those insects which feed on sweet smelling flowers will be attracted . Wear clean clothing and bathe daily ; sweat seems to irritate stinging insects . Cover the body as much as is possible and reasonable . Ankle-high shoes or white cotton socks should be worn when walking in fields . Covering the head with a straw hat or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair . Avoid flower gardens and fields where wildflowers are common . Stinging insects are likely to be found wherever flowers grow . However , plants need pollination and the insects need food . We can not have one without the other . Check your yard for new ground and aerial social wasp nests by watching insect flight and activity during the warmer hours . The social wasps begin their nests in the spring . As populations build , flight activity increases . One seldom sees the nests in their initial stages , but by July and early August their populations will be larger and more easily detected . Keep picnic areas clean and free of food refuse . Poor sanitation in parks , around food stands and in dumps may encourage social wasp populations to build more rapidly . Concerned persons should notify their health departments of unsanitary conditions . Run if you are attacked by several stinging insects at once . The only time many wasps or bees will attack simultaneously is when a nest is disturbed or broken . It is best to run indoors or into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to escape , jump into water . If an offensive insect flies in through a window while you are driving , it is best to remain as still as possible while slowing the car and moving to the road shoulder . When the car is stopped , open all of the windows and the insect will soon escape . A person who is sensitive to one stinging species may not be allergic to all of them . Try to capture a stinging insect so it may be identified . Killing the bee or wasp with a fly swatter is satisfactory if there is no other way . <p> CARTOON <p>                     @x The National Centre for Mental Health has ditched open wards in favour of private rooms . Andrew Mickel discovers how its striking design has captivated users and staff alike <p> The National Centre for Mental Health is quiet . Indeed , for anyone who is used to mental health units consisting of open-plan wards that echo with daytime TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the lack of privacy and risk of users upsetting each other inherent in an open plan layout has been shunned in favour of individual rooms and treatment suites which better suit users ' needs . <p> " A lot of people ask where all the patients are when they first get here , " says Natalie Willetts , a nurse consultant at the recently opened centre . " But there 's the same number as in the old site . The design is just more effective . " <p> The rediscovery of doors in hospital design may seem relatively insignificant , but it is the sort of minor change that constructing a centre from scratch has allowed to be built in  --  minor changes that add up to a big difference . Combining the building design with organisational changes has resulted in more patient-centred care at what is hailed as the UK 's leading mental health hub . <p> The 70m NCMH was built near the sprawling Queen Elizabeth Hospital complex in Edgbaston , Birmingham . It 's been up and running since the Queen Elizabeth Psychiatric Hospital was vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its overcrowded predecessor , the NCMH is a low-key sanctuary . <p> Relaxation is built into the fabric of the centre , with the three units that comprise the 137-bed service named after relaxing herbs . The Barberry unit provides specialist services , including a mother and baby centre , neuropsychiatry and a centre for eating disorders . Next door , the Oleaster provides acute in-patient care . And the 32-bed Zinnia is in the Sparkhill area of the city to engage hard-to-reach groups . <p> The development process involved users and staff . Pat Fleetwood-Walker 's daughter used the old hospital , and Pat participated in the planning of the new one . " One of the most dramatic changes is the individual rooms . Before , there were no rooms , just mixed wards , " she says . " The women were often scared . We were concerned about the security both in the wards and in acute care . That , and the fact there was nothing to do , were the biggest concerns . " <p> An activity worker now focuses on providing events in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barberry and the Oleaster is split into male and female wards . Willetts says the separate wards add security and allow for the different care needs of men and women . <p> Such responsive development means that the staff are proud of the centre , and praise both the architects and Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust . Surprisingly , the old hospital was just 15 years old when it was demolished . But Kate Phipps , who was the hospital 's project director , says the site was not built for purpose and was n't working . <p> " When the national services framework for mental health was launched , it caused everyone to look differently at their services , " she says . " The trust began to question the relevance of the old hospitals . <p> " We 've had an 18-month transformation process to see what people wanted when they came into care . For example , we now have doctors who work only with in-patients , home treatment or in the community . " <p> Before the changes , there could be up to 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff time would be sucked up dealing with the bureaucracy of handling so many people . Now , dedicated doctors allow staff to spend more therapeutic time with patients . <p> Another change is the relocation of south Birmingham 's two home treatment teams into the Oleaster building . Then project manager Suzanne Bramall oversaw the move to the site , and says that it has allowed more efficient working with centre staff too . <p> " We now have daily contact with the wards without fail . By being here we can be involved from when someone comes in and we can be planning their discharge . If there is someone who has not been claiming benefits and not maintaining their property , we can get those sorted at an earlier stage and discharges are n't held up , " she says . <p> Each specialist unit is tailored to specific needs . Take the 12-bed Jasmine Suite in the Barberry , which is one of the UK 's few deaf services for mental health . Door buzzers and vibrating pillows let staff contact users when they are in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dark corridors of the old hospital . Users do n't stay in their rooms , but can visit the unlocked art room and the two courtyards . An impromptu photo shoot seems to draw most of the unit to the lounge in double-quick time . This is a unit that works . <p> It 's also a centre that engages with current national mental health issues . Drivers in patient-centred care are being followed  --  most notably for protected meal times that allow users to eat their meals in peace . For example , despite being accompanied by Willetts , we were blocked from entering a ward on Oleaster during dinner . <p> All staff are being trained in basic talking therapies . Willetts says : " We have a designated in-patient psychologist who teaches everyone what we call psychological mindedness , which is about working with users from their point of view , rather than seeing everything as a medical diagnosis . All staff have the same starting block , whether they are a domestic or a ward clerk . " <p> It is perhaps testament to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts and bolts of what 's going  --  they are simply seeing an improved level of care . <p> Gene Needham , who has used the old hospital and the new centre , thinks the most effective improvements are the most straightforward ones . " The new suites are unbelievably beautiful  --  light and bright , with lovely furniture . <p> " Before , if you were ill , it was dreadful to be in a ward with people you could n't get away from . Now if you are in your room , it 's your choice whether to go and mix with others . The rooms are lovely , staff morale has lifted , and the service user is listened to , " Needham says . " It is , simply , conducive to better healthcare .
