Some of the greatest American music of the 20th century was recorded in the 1920s and ' 30s by the likes of King Oliver , Louis Armstrong , Jelly Roll Morton and Bix Beiderbecke . Trouble is , the 78 r.p.m.s they left behind give only a scratchy approximation of what their bands sounded like . Much of this classic material was reissued on LPs , but the technology used to reduce the surface noise often left the instruments sounding dead and flat . Now the advent of the CD has spawned another prodigious outpouring of reissues . And finally someone has had the time , affection and sheer wizardry to bring this great music alive for the hi-fi era : Australian sound engineer Robert Parker . <P> Parker 's Jazz Classics in Digital Stereo series , produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corp . ( ABC ) and now widely available in U.S. record stores for the first time , is a miracle of sound restoration . Starting with mint- condition 78s ( his collection numbers more than 20,000 ) , Parker applies a variety of noise-suppression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The result is a three-dimensional sound image with much of the presence , depth and dynamics of a live band . Trumpets bite , cymbals sizzle , bass strings snap and ring . Like an art restorer who scrapes off centuries ' worth of grime to reveal the vibrant colors of the original , Parker makes it possible to hear the music as it must have sounded in New Orleans dance halls and Harlem ballrooms 60 years ago . <P> The son of an Australian electrical engineer , Parker began collecting old 78s at age 12 and soon started experimenting with various speakers , amplifiers and filters to improve on their sound . He perfected his method over three decades . When he went public with some of his stereo re-creations on Australian radio in 1982 , the audience response was so enthusiastic that abc offered him a regular radio show and began producing his albums . Parker continued the series after moving to England in 1990 and has so far turned out some 60 albums , 26 of which have been rereleased in the U.S. through DRG Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 55 , speaks passionately about his work . " It 's really miraculous when you think about it , " he says , taking a shiny black record from its jacket . " These little shellac disks are like time capsules . " He marvels at the amount of sonic information that was originally captured on the old records  --  far more than the primitive playback techniques of the time were able to reproduce . <P> Parker is not aiming at archival preservation . In fact , some jazz purists fault him for taking liberties with the original material . Parker shrugs off the charge . " There 's this romantic notion that cracks and surface noise are part of the charm of the old 78s . Not for me . " And certainly not for the vast majority of the listening public  --  particularly younger music fans  --  who have grown used to CDs and sophisticated sound equipment . " Here 's this amazing American cultural heritage locked in an antique technology , " says Parker , " and that 's a barrier to a younger generation that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My goal is to break down that barrier . "
