<p> Ships on the rocks . <p> Ships adrift without power . <p> Ships awash in plumbing problems . <p> Ships returning with scores of sick passengers . <p> You 'd think the cruise industry , in the rough wake of widely reported problems , is losing its carefree vacation image with travelers . <p> You 'd be wrong . <p> Despite several mishaps in recent months , ocean-going cruise ships have fewer trip-wrecking troubles than ever . And experts say travelers are quick to forgive , if not forget , about a few soured sailings . <p> Outbreaks of widespread illness on ships have plummeted , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which inspects ships ' water , food sanitation and general cleanliness . <p> " In any given week , you are 10 times more likely to be in an auto accident - and twice as likely to be injured in an accident - than you are to be caught in an illness epidemic on a cruise ship , " says actuary Fred Kilbourne of San Diego , an independent expert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers spent at sea jumped 41% in five years , the rate of serious shipboard illness outbreaks fell more than 75% , says Tom O'Toole of the CDC 's National Center for Environmental Health . <p> From 1975 to 1979 , there were 8.1 gastrointestinal disease outbreaks for every 10 million passenger days , he says . In the period from 1989 to 1993 , the rate dropped to 2.1 . <p> The rate - and the risk - is falling still . <p> In 1994 , four illness incidents affected 830 people - a rate of 1.5 outbreaks in 10 million passenger days , according to O'Toole . <p> Neither is the cruise fleet more prone to major hardware problems or accidents , U.S. Coast Guard statistics show . <p> " These ships are safe and getting safer , " says Commander William Uberti , manager of the program that enforces marine inspection of U.S. ships worldwide and foreign ships in U.S. waters . <p> In 1989 , when 106 cruise ships carried 3.3 million North American passengers , there were only six incidents of groundings , fires , accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Coast Guard . <p> By 1994 , when 133 ships carried 4.6 million people , there were only seven such serious incidents . <p> " These ships are very big and very complicated systems . Undoubtedly sometimes things go wrong . And there are human errors as well , " Uberti says . <p> Although incidents such as the groundings last month of the Royal Majesty off Nantucket , Mass. , and the Star Princess in Alaska ruined thousands of vacations , Uberti points out , " no one was hurt and all the safety systems held . <p> " The fact that you are uncomfortable is not a life-or-death thing , " Uberti says . <p> It is a perception thing . <p> " These cruise lines have to provide a certain level of fun , excitement and consistent quality and if they do n't , they wo n't continue to exist , " says Paul Grimes , consumer columnist for Conde Nast Traveler . <p> When the refurbished QE2 sails without adequate plumbing or a fire on Carnival 's Celebration cuts off electricity and propulsion or there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which have occurred in a matter of months - it 's hard to remember these troubles do n't add up to a trend . <p> But even though these incidents are as unrelated as any clump of cars driving on the same expressway , the cruise industry 's image is taking a real drubbing . <p> And cruise bookings have been soft since last August , as well , leading some to wonder if there 's a tie between bad publicity and slowing sales . <p> No , says Jim Parker , a stock analyst with Robinson &; Humphrey in Atlanta , who tracks the cruise industry . <p> " The real truth : It 's a mystery . Too many new berths ? The economy ? The bad reports ? No one can exactly pinpoint the reason for soft demand , " Parker says . <p> The cruise industry says fear of illness or accidents at sea is not to blame . <p> " Only 4% of 2,000 people in a new survey said they were less interested in cruising because of all that 's gone wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cruise Lines International Association . CLIA , whose members carry 95% of all North American cruise passengers , sponsored the survey . <p> This is no surprise to travel agent Craig Satterfield or his customers at Cruise Time in San Francisco . <p> " Whenever something happens to people in a closed environment , one they ca n't walk away from , it heightens the emotional interest . People may say , ' Gee , I 'm happy I was n't on that ship , ' " he says . <p> " Then they realize ( the incidents ) are not life-threatening and they continue to book their cruises . They know even in the worst conditions , the cruise line opens the bar . " <p> Satterfield is being flippant but his fundamental point , he says , is that travelers know the hospitality industry will do good for its clients or lose them . <p> When a ship sails into serious trouble , cruise lines typically give passengers full refunds and a free or discounted future cruise . Evidently the goodwill effort works , says Al Wallack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free future cruise - and they bring friends and family with them . Many come back as fast as they can , " Wallack says . <p> His company , Celebrity , was struck by a rare outbreak of Legionnaires ' Disease aboard the Horizon from last April through July . One person died and nearly 50 were ill . <p> This summer , he says , " The Horizon is the most successful ship to Bermuda and it will be a sold-out season . " <p> Putting it in perspective <p> Getting sick aboard a cruise ship is a longshot - even though a rash of incidents in recent months may make it seem otherwise . Risk expert Fred Kilbourne says if everyone in the USA cruised for one week , 35,000 of them would fall ill. ( 1 ) The risk : 140 in a million . That compares with your weekly risk of : <p> Being in a car crash . . . . . . . 2,500 in a million <p> Being injured in that car crash . . . 440 in a million <p> Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 84 in a million <p> Breaking a bone . . . . . . . . . . . 80 in a million <p> Catching chicken pox . . . . . . . . 13 in a million ( 1 ) Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's 1989-1993 rate of reported shipboard illness . <p> Making sure all is shipshape on cruises <p> Who monitors health and safety on cruise ships ? <p>  --  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : Inspects and rates ships in four areas of sanitation : water systems , food preparation , potential for contamination of food sources and general cleanliness . <p> Each ship gets two unannounced inspections a year . Those that score below 86 on a 100-point scale must be re-inspected within 50 days . All but 13% of ships , however , pass initial inspection . And the CDC has never had to use its authority to quarantine a ship . <p> Travelers can learn a specific ship 's score through their travel agent or by fax .

There 's a full inspection annually , plus quarterly safety checks . Ships can not sail from U.S. ports without current , valid certification . <p> The Coast Guard also investigates injuries or deaths aboard cruise ships as well as any mechanical failure or accident that affects seaworthiness . If a ship registered in the United States ( U.S. flag ) fails to meet Coast Guard standards , the Coast Guard can restrict or revoke its certification . The Coast Guard can act through the International Maritime Association against a foreign flag ship . <p> The Coast Guard does not publish listings of how ships fared . But , says project officer Hal Cohoon , " If they 're sailing from a U.S. port , they 've passed .
