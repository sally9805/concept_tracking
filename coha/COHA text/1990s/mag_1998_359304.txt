Will MONICA LEWINSKY get big bucks for her story ? Many publishing-industry insiders say no . Too many big-ticket books , like DICK MORRIS ' $2.5 million memoir , have bombed , and Lewinsky may spill most of her beans in public . On the high side , publisher JUDITH REGAN estimates that Monica 's story is worth " maybe as much as a million , " while ROBERT GOTTLIEB of the William Morris Agency puts the number in the low six figures . LARRY KIRSHBAUM of Time Warner Trade Publishing is closefisted , saying , " I think we 're all bimboed out . " The supermarket tabloids are similarly split . The Star 's PHIL BUNTON has a standing offer of $1 million to hear Lewinsky 's story , while the Globe 's TONY FROST has " scant interest . " Meanwhile , right-wing publisher Regnery next week becomes the first with a proimpeachment book , this one by commentator ANN COULTER . <P>  --  By Andrea Sachs/New York                  @ @ @
