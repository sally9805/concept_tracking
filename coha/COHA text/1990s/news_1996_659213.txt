But the company will have to shed some properties . <p> The Federal Communications Commission voted 5-0 on Feb. 8 to remove the last hurdle to the $ 19 billion deal . Disney completed the acquisition Feb. 9 . <p> The commission wo n't let Disney permanently own , as it had requested , radio stations and a newspaper in Fort Worth , Texas , and in Pontiac-Detroit , Mich . <p> Instead , the commission will give the company a one-year waiver from cross-ownership rules to allow Disney time to sell or swap either the radio or the newspaper properties .

Both said there is ample media competition in the two markets . Each market has more than 50 separately owned broadcast outlets , they said . <p> Quello said the FCC 's newspaper-broadcast rules " no longer reflect the realities of the marketplace . " <p> Federal regulations prohibit one company from owning a newspaper and a radio station in the same market . Legislation overhauling the nation 's telecommunications laws , which President Clinton signed Feb. 8 , would not change that . <p> In Fort Worth , Capital Cities/ABC owns WBAP-AM , KSCS-FM and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . It also owns WJR-AM and WHYT-FM in Detroit and the Oakland Press in Pontiac , Mich . <p> Capital Cities/ABC was allowed to keep those properties because it owned them before the FCC had regulations barring such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FCC said . <p> For Disney to win a permanent waiver , it would have to prove that the combined ownership is in the public interest , the FCC says . <p> In 20 years , the FCC has granted only two waivers to its newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rules . And the standard has been tough - in both cases , owners had to show the newspapers would otherwise go out of business , FCC attorneys said . <p> For Disney , the FCC waived local ownership rules so that it may permanently own TV-radio combinations in Chicago , New York , Los Angeles , San Francisco , Flint-Detroit and Toledo-Detroit . <p> Disney and ABC shareholders approved the deal on Jan. 4 . <p> Disney would replace Time Warner Inc. as the media industry 's largest company .

In 1986 , PBS ' " Frontline " taped jurors in Wisconsin deliberating the case of a defendant accused of illegal possession of a gun . The defendant was acquitted . <p> The 5-2 decision Feb. 6 by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court will let CBS place up to five cameras in the courtroom and two cameras in the jury room during a civil case .

CBS asked last month for access to deliberations in a criminal case in Arizona . The Arizona Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the request . <p> CBS News spokeswoman Sandy Genelius said the network was seeking access to jury deliberations for an upcoming " CBS Reports " documentary expected to air later this year . She declined to elaborate , citing concerns about competition . <p> The high court approved the request without comment . <p> In a dissent , Justices Caroline Glassman and Paul Rudman warned : " Selection of only those jurors who do not mind thinking out loud before millions of observers , or those who will serve but in silence , by its nature will distort the jury 's deliberative process .

Rothberg said the company did agree to their request to stop airing the peach-eating footage . <p> " People were laughing because she was not the most attractive individual in the world , " Rothberg said . <p> " She feels that she 's been wrongfully treated by a man who has ... a responsibility to act in a responsible manner , and she feels that he 's violated her right to privacy , her right to be left alone , " Rothberg said . <p> Rothberg said a lawyer for Worldwide Pants , in discussions last fall , cited a notice that appears on the back of U.S. Open tickets that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any live or recorded video display or other transmission or reproduction of the tournament .
