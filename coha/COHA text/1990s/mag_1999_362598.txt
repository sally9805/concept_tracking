In the grunge-struck ' 90s , when record-industry sages were trumpeting Nirvana and the flannel-clad hordes from Seattle as the next big thing , Arista Records president Clive Davis made a huge gamble : he invested millions in hip-hop , a genre many viewed as too troubled to be worth the risk . But the grunge bubble went bust , of course , as did a few of the labels betting on it . Today , hip-hop rolls along as comfortably as Puff Daddy does in his Bentley . <P> Youth culture may rule music , but Davis , 65 , always seems to have the right spin on the future . The year that ended in June was Arista 's best ever  --  $425 million in sales and 69 gold or platinum disks by artists from diva Whitney Houston to country star Alan Jackson . Davis has shown a few sharp moves on the business side too , making use of low-cost joint ventures to manage the financial risks , which allows him to take the musical risks needed to develop and sustain new talent . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 , whose relevance has dwindled since his 1970 hit Abraxas . Last year the Woodstock veteran signed with Arista . Davis refocused Santana 's songs toward radio and teamed him with new stars like Lauryn Hill , enticing a new generation of fans to discover his flamboyant guitar playing . Santana is now enjoying a view he has n't seen in two decades : his new album Supernatural sits in the Top 5 and has sold more than 2 million copies . " I only look for headliners , " Davis says . " An artist has to be able to fulfill in person the magic on a record . " <P> And then there is Sarah McLachlan 's Surfacing , a beautiful album of light folk-pop  --  which could be a euphemism for " slow death . " Davis divined a vast pool of potential buyers awakened by the Lilith Fair Tour , so Arista flogged the album at MTV and radio for months until the dam finally broke . At 7 million sold , Surfacing has become a Jewel-and Alanis-style blockbuster . No wonder the stymied Artist most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door . His new Arista album debuts next month . <P> Music is a game of averages , and Davis certainly does n't bat .1000 ; Puff Daddy 's solo album Forever is off to a slow start . But Arista has created enough hits to help lift the market share of its corporate parent BMG from 14% to 18% , second only to the Universal Music Group 's 27% . <P> For such a hip guy , Davis has a style that is distinctly Old World . He prefers handwritten notes to e-mail . And he usually dresses in the pin-striped , cuff-linked style of a diplomat . That can make him easy to spot at nightclubs checking out new acts or perhaps talking shop with his protege , Puff Daddy . " When I go to see Clive , I 'm going to school , " says Puffy .
