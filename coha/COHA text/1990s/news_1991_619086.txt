<p> ' EVERYBODY <p> WINS ' <p> Editor  --  The U.S. is justifiably concerned about Soviet nuclear weapons and the Soviet people fear drastically short food supplies and a crippled distribution system . <p> Why not offer to buy these Soviet weapons with U.S. dollars ? The Soviets , in turn , must agree to use the money to buy U.S. food and trucks . <p> Everybody wins ! Soviet citizens eat this winter and avoid violent upheaval . U.S. farmers profit , our depressed auto industry gets vast new sales , and we greatly reduce the possibility of nuclear attacks against us . <p> ROBERT L. LEMON <p> Berkeley <p> ZIONISM RESOLUTION <p> Editor  --  The repeal of the U.N . resolution equating Zionism with racism , which never should have been passed in the first place , has finally taken place . President Bush deserves credit for being instrumental in its demise . <p> The vote makes apparent how little the Arab countries desire peace with Israel . The best Egypt could manage is to be absent from the vote . Syria , Lebanon and Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kuwait , who owe both the United States and Israel a debt of gratitude , did not vote for the repeal . <p> ROXANNE DUPEE <p> Scotts Valley ( Santa Cruz County ) <p> NEW DEFINITION ? <p> Editor  --  The U.N . adopts the New World Order 's definition of racism : a form of discrimination based solely on race by any non-Zionist person , group or government . <p> SALLY TORN <p> San Francisco <p> ARAB , ISRAELI VIOLENCE <p> Editor  --  For the past four years , stones have been hurled , bodies have been burned , people , both Jews and Arabs , have been injured , maimed , raped , hanged , murdered , as a direct result of the violent nature of the Palestinian uprising in the territories administered by Israel . <p> In recent weeks , precisely as peace negotiations got under way to determine the future status of these territories , live ammunition has been used by Palestinian Arabs to kill three innocent Israeli Jews who were ambushed . There have been other , luckier victims of live ammunition attacks who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palestinian Arab violence on Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs alike , a picture published in The Chronicle exploited a wrongful incident to suggest that increased security restrictions by Israel in the territories are unjustified . Stones hurled by Jewish settlers at Arab vehicles , such as the one pictured on Page A7 on December 16 , is a symptom of the cycle of violence prevalent in the territories rather than the root cause . <p> RONIT ROSENBERG <p> Public Affairs Officer <p> Consulate General of Israel <p> San Francisco <p> THE HOMELESS FACTOR <p> Editor  --  If columnist Richard Reeves had been a resident of San Francisco while the homeless were camped on a semi-permanent basis in Civic Center , he would have a better understanding of why Mayor Agnos was defeated ( Chronicle , December 16 ) . San Franciscans do want to help the homeless , but the majority evidently did not feel that making the entire Civic Center a major threat to public health and safety was a satisfactory way to go about solving any problem . <p> We are not talking aesthetics here . We are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall rest rooms . <p> CHRISTIE HOCHSCHILD <p> San Francisco <p> HOLIDAY VISITOR <p> Editor  --  I still think about her visit ; it just wo n't go away . <p> The gay and lesbian federal employee group , FLAG , was having a holiday party at my house . We left the front door wide open , so people could just come and go as they pleased . Good food , good friends , good drinks . Everyone was in their holiday finest . <p> Suddenly the room was silent . Standing at the buffet was a toothless , old woman in a battered red sweat suit . She had wandered in through the open door . " I 'm cold and hungry , " she cried . " I 'm cold and hungry . " <p> She soon left , but with a plate of food , some spare change , and a shot of bourbon in her belly . As she shuffled out the door she looked back . " Merry Christmas , " she said , as she disappeared into the cold , black night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get it all mixed up with guests at a Passover seder and a babe born in a manger . <p> JOHN-MICHAEL OLEXY <p> San Francisco <p> ' ART VINDICTIVE ' <p> Editor  --  Well , Mayor Agnos asserts that he is not vindictive . ( Not ! ) <p> In that case , how would you describe his rush at appointing or reappointing commission members that will serve well into or through Frank Jordan 's term ? <p> He says he 's just doing the job that he was elected to do . I say he 's just trying to get back at the man who bested him fairly and squarely . <p> TRACY SMITH <p> San Francisco <p> ' GOD SAVE THE ELITE ! ' <p> Editor  --  I have an idea . Let 's get rid of the welfare system entirely and eliminate the poor altogether ! ( On paper anyway . ) Then the rest of us can dispel that awful notion that there is enough food and space for everyone , and that the basic amenities of food , shelter , medical care and education are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's do away with the country 's educational system . We will all have more than enough resources to send our children to private schools . Then , too , our tax money can go toward something interesting , like . . . ourselves ! <p> It will be good to get rid of those horrible welfare cheaters who steal from the honest , fortunate people for their own survival . It 's no wonder the rich resort to tax evasion ! <p> God save the elite ! Hail Wilson ! <p> The social and financial footholds of life are stronger for those of us near the top , right ? <p> Governor Wilson is a saint of a human being and should not be thought of as an insipid-elitist-pig- scrooge and certainly should not be recalled or anything like that . Right ? <p> SUSAN ALTENHEIN <p> Willits ( Mendocino County ) <p> RENTER 'S TAX CREDIT <p> Editor  --  As a member of the working and renting class , I resent Governor Wilson 's efforts to balance the budget by removing the renter 's tax credit . Checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the renter 's credit has been the factor which changed my state tax return from an " owe " to a modest refund . <p> Governor Wilson is conveniently " forgetting " that the renter 's tax credit was put in place to afford renters some small degree of parity with the tax deductions for interest payments enjoyed by California homebuyers . <p> If Governor Wilson wants " tax fairness , " as he is fond of saying , I would support elimination of the renter 's tax credit if and only if it is coupled with repeal of the tax deductions for interest paid by homeowners . <p> Despite the fact that my home- owning friends may want to lynch me if these words see print in The Chronicle , I feel safe in suggesting it because of the unlikelihood of a Republican governor embracing it or a Democratic-controlled Legislature passing it . <p> ROBERT LICHTMAN <p> Glen Ellen ( Sonoma County ) <p> WILLIE BROWN <p> Editor  --  Willie Brown . The man 's super ego and his arrogance seemingly have no limits . His challenge of Proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands of Californians who voted for Proposition 140 , " Stick it in your ears ! I 'll run anyway and I 'll win . And then I 'll resign and my name will go into the history books . " This is certainly consistent with the contempt he has shown for the citizens of California for years . He has become so obsessed with his own power he can not accept the reality that the real power lies with the people , who sometimes decide to exercise it . <p> There is still time before the 1996 elections for Brown to mellow . He might leave his final term in the Assembly with more stature , and even respect , if he did so saying , " I strongly disagree in principle with term limits , but I also respect the collective will and wisdom of our citizens . I wish my successor well . " That would be the admirable thing to do . <p> W. B. CLINCH <p> San Mateo <p> THE HONIG CAPER <p> Editor  --  Does any thinking person believe that this attack on Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but politics at its gutter level ? The majority on the state Board of Education is Republican and state Attorney General Lungren is beholden to its wishes . He is the designated hatchet-man . <p> When President Carrabino and his crew voted on expending $ 150,000 for a private investigation of Honig and his wife 's school , they even permitted a 17-year-old student to cast the deciding vote even though he admitted at the time that he did n't know exactly what he was voting on . <p> Mr. Honig initially requested that an audit of his books be made , and freely opened the files of the Quality Education Project . This was done ; even so , early this fall , Lungren 's investigators , some with guns drawn , raided his home and confiscated the QEP records in true Gestapo-style . <p> Let 's not lose sight of the fact that Bill Honig is an elected state official , answerable to the citizens of California , whereas the members of the state Board of Education are purely partisan appointees . <p> DAVID E.
