I : finding a solution The first real hope of reducing the epidemic 20,000 ACL knee injuries sustained yearly in skiing is at hand . A research team has designed a training program that , in a recent study , reduced the incidence of ACL sprains among professional skiers by more than half . An experimental version of the training program has recently been made available to skiers in general . " Twenty years ago , Alpine skiers worried about breaking their legs , " says Dr. Jasper Shealy , professor of industrial engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology and a member of the research team that developed and tested the program . " Today , with the risk of sustaining a broken leg down by more than 90 percent , skiers are concerned with the ruination of their knees . Before this study , there was n't a product , service , or procedure that reduced the risk of serious knee sprains . In the past , when people asked me how to prevent ACL injury , the only thing I could tell them was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to modify the way that they ski , and thereby reduce the risk of ACL injury . " Injuries to the ACL , or anterior cruciate ligament , are significant because it is the knee 's vital stabilizer . Connecting the femur ( thigh bone ) and the tibia ( shin bone ) , it helps to maintain proper alignment of these load-bearing bones , keeping the lower leg from sliding forward relative to the thigh . The professional and consumer ACL programs were developed by Carl Ettlinger , president of Vermont Safety Research ; Dr. Robert Johnson , professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Vermont ; and Dr. Shealy . The team 's study of ACL injuries has been underway for 12 years , involving the analysis of more than 14,000 ski injuries and the review of more than a score of videotapes of actual ACL sprains . " We found a distinct pattern to the events that lead to ACL sprains , " says Johnson . " We thought if skiers could disrupt the pattern , they could help reduce the risk of injury . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team designed a training program to teach ski-area employees strategies intended to reduce the risk of knee injury . The training consisted of interactive learning sessions conducted by ski-area staff , using computer-enhanced videos of actual knee injuries to show skiers how the injury occurs . The employees were also asked to develop strategies to avoid injury . The group put its program to the test during the ' ' 93- ' ' 94 ski season , training 4,000 ski instructors and patrollers from 20 ski areas . Compared with data collected from the previous two seasons , ACL sprains among the group declined by 62 percent . Injury reports from another 22 ski areas  --  whose employees were not trained  --  were analyzed as a control . No decline in ACL injuries was observed in the control group . " The results should be viewed as remarkable , " said Shealy . " If we could sustain this level of improvement in the general public , it would practically erase the threefold increase in ACL sprains we have witnessed over the past two decades . " This increase has occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To communicate its message directly to the general public , the group has introduced an experimental video-based training program , entitled " ACL Awareness , " which is available for a fee to ski schools , health-care professionals , and individual skiers . Work on the consumer program is ongoing ; this year , instructors and patrollers at more than 80 ski areas in the U.S. and Canada are participating in the professional version of the program , helping the research team develop new ways to communicate the message more clearly to skiers of all levels . The importance of these programs will become even more evident once several misconceptions about knee injuries are cleared up . " Most skiers assume that it is the binding 's job to protect the entire leg from every possible calamity , " explains Ettlinger . " Although the chance of breaking a leg has been related to the quality of the release system , serious knee sprains apparently are not related . And skiers of all levels of ability , experience , strength , and conditioning are susceptible to serious knee sprains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle in comparison with the dramatic scene that precedes the typical lower-leg fracture . In the typical knee injury , neither the binding nor the skier is forewarned of impending injury to the ACL . Knee sprains in skiing are often thought of as the injury that causes the fall . In contrast , in lower leg and ankle injuries , the initial fall or subsequent events usually cause the injury . " The ACL Awareness program was designed to deal with this lack of warning by conveying a simple message  --  avoid high-risk behavior and learn to recognize and effectively respond to potentially dangerous situations when they arise . This concept replaces a reliance on hardware  --  the Alpine release binding  --  with a new emphasis on software : reprogramming the skier to sense the earliest stages of the chain of events leading to ACL injury . II : ACL awareness training The following is adapted from the experimental ACL Awareness education program developed by Dr. Jasper Shealy , Dr. Robert Johnson , and Carl Ettlinger . The first step in reducing the risk of ACL injury is to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , before an injury occurs . The most common ACL-injury scenario has been termed the " Phantom Foot " because it involves the tail of the ski , a lever that functions like an unnatural foot extending in the direction opposite to a skier 's real foot . There are three types of situations that can lead to Phantom Foot ACL injuries : * Attempting to get up after a fall while still moving . * Attempting to recover from an off-balance position . * Attempting to sit down after losing control . We developed a profile of the Phantom Foot injury based on the analysis of more than 14,000 skiing injuries , including scores of videotapes of actual ACL sprains . The following six elements define the profile : * Uphill arm back . * Skier off-balance to the rear . * Hips below the knees . * Uphill ski unweighted. * All weight on the inside edge of the downhill ski tail . * Upper body generally facing downhill ski . When all six elements of the Phantom Foot profile fall into place , injury to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Phantom Foot ACL injury studied in the development of the program , all six elements were present . ) Although these elements may occur in almost any order during a sudden loss of balance or control , the order above is typical of the chain of events that can put the average skier at risk . The photo sequence shown on the previous page was taken from a video of an actual injury to a female skier . ( Photo sequence omitted ) If you look closely at each frame , you can see all six elements occurring as the skier attempts to sit down following a loss of control . ( The skier sustained a serious ACL sprain 1/30 of a second after the last frame in this sequence . ) But learning to recognize potentially dangerous situations is only the first step . To help reduce the risk of ACL sprains , the skier must learn to respond quickly and effectively . The solution , it seems , is to make one or more of the elements of the Phantom Foot profile untrue . The skier must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into place . The scenes in the photo sequence show a seemingly irreversible chain of events leading to ACL injury . However , the skier could have escaped injury by taking appropriate action had she perceived the risk . Numerous strategies are possible , but the most desirable plan is one that addresses as many elements of the Phantom Foot profile as is practical . A successful strategy should be quick to learn and easy to execute , without limiting the skier 's ability to take other appropriate actions , including any measures necessary to avoid collision with obstacles or other skiers . The following three-step plan summarizes the elements of an appropriate initial response . ( Three-step plan omitted ) However , this plan is only one example of the type of initial response that may help reduce the risk of injury : What makes this an effective response ? Phantom Foot injuries occur when the tail of the downhill ski , in combination with the stiff back of the modern ski boot , acts as a lever to apply a unique combination of twisting and bending loads to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh in line with the downhill ski and thereby reduce the twisting loads on the knee ; to reposition the uphill ski so that weight can be transferred to it ; and to put the skier in a good position for a recovery or a controlled fall ( that is , a bailout ) . It may also be possible to help reduce your risk of serious knee sprains by paying closer attention to your skiing technique . Several elements of the Phantom Foot profile can be considered bad habits : extending your uphill arm back , being off-balance to the rear , and dropping your hips below your knees . By routinely taking corrective actions whenever any one of the three is encountered , you could help prevent the chain of events leading to ACL injury from ever getting started . However , when several elements of the Phantom Foot syndrome fall into place rapidly , a practiced response strategy must be implemented quickly . Many injuries might be prevented by learning a few simple rules and eliminating altogether certain types of high-risk behavior : Do n't fully straighten your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bail out by means of a controlled fall , your knees should remain flexed until you have stopped sliding . Although you should routinely correct your stance whenever your hips fall below your knees , attempting to straighten your legs as part of an initial response to the full-blown threat of an ACL injury puts the already vulnerable downhill knee at even greater risk . Straighten your legs only as part of a maneuver to recover balance and control after you have addressed other elements of the Phantom Foot profile . Your knees are most vulnerable when they are fully flexed or fully extended . Do n't try to get up until you 've stopped sliding . Unless you are trying to avoid an obstacle or another skier , when you 're down , stay down . Do n't land on your uphill hand . Keep your arms up and forward in any kind of fall . Whether you 're trying to get up or sit down , if your skis are still moving , you 're at risk . You greatly increase the chance of injury if you break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your uphill hand after you have fallen . Editor 's note : Although the Phantom Foot syndrome is probably the most common cause of ACL injuries , it is not the only way to injure your ACL while skiing . Nor will simply reading this article make you immune to knee injury . You can gain a much more complete understanding of ACL injury and prevention via the full ACL Awareness program . It gives you a visceral awareness and a clearer mental image of the events that lead to injury .
