Section : THE TIME MACHINE One Hundred and Seventy-five Years Ago The Monroe Doctrine <p> On December 2 , in his annual message to Congress , President James Monroe declared North and South America to be off-limits for any further European colonial expansion . " The American continents , " he said , " by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain , are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers . " Those powers could keep the American colonies they still had , Monroe said , but any attempt to expand them , establish new ones , or retake old ones , anywhere in the hemisphere , would be considered an act of hostility toward the United States . The President called his principle the American System ; in the 1850s it became better known as the Monroe Doctrine . <p> The doctrine had been inspired by the emergence of independent republics in the former Spanish colonies of Buenos Aires , Chile , Colombia , Mexico , and Peru after Spain 's devastation in the Napoleonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but European countries , clinging to the old order , were reluctant to follow suit . When a French army invaded Spain in April 1823 , overthrew the constitutional government , and restored Ferdinand VII to the throne , observers on both sides of the Atlantic feared that France 's next step would be to retake Spain 's former colonies . <p> Britain , which dominated trade with Latin America , was just as concerned as the United States . In August it suggested a pact between the two countries to jointly resist incursions into the region . Most of the resistance would necessarily come from Britain , whose globe-spanning navy dwarfed the United States 's tiny fleet . Monroe was interested , but Secretary of State John Quincy Adams opposed making the United States " a cock-boat to Britain 's man-of-war . " In November the question became moot when news arrived that Britain had abandoned the proposal . Monroe and Adams surmised , correctly , that France had manifested a lack of interest in taking Latin America . <p> Thus Monroe could propound his doctrine with little fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing too : At the time , the U.S. military was no match for the fighting forces of Europe . Having witnessed the British burning of Washington less than a decade before , Monroe knew the United States could still barely defend itself , let alone the rest of the hemisphere . <p> France was not the only source of concern . The Monroe Doctrine also addressed the United States 's first major issue in transpacific diplomacy . Back in 1799 Russia had established the Russian America Company to exploit natural resources from the Pacific Northwest . Most of its operations took place in Alaska , but in 1821 Czar Alexander claimed the American coast all the way down to fifty-one degrees north latitude , about 140 miles north of the present Canadian border , barred all foreign ships from the area , and declared a monopoly on hunting , fishing , and trading . <p> Much of that territory was also claimed by the United States and Britain , and although only a handful of Europeans lived there at the time , Monroe knew it would become increasingly significant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers were known to have designs on California ( which was then a part of Mexico ) and a strong aversion to democracy . While the Monroe Doctrine was not a direct challenge to the czar , it did serve notice of the United States 's determination to check Russia 's expansionism . In 1825 Russia agreed to restrict its claims to the area north of 54 degrees 40 ' . <p> The Monroe Doctrine stands out today as the United States 's first confident assertion of its importance in global affairs . Latin Americans welcomed it as a blow for democracy against royalist Europe . Years later , however , the doctrine would grow far beyond Monroe 's intentions into the United States 's self-appointment as an all-powerful hemispheric police officer . In that form the Monroe Doctrine would be far less popular among our neighbors to the south . Little Santa Claus <p> On December 23 the Troy , New York , Sentinel published an unsigned poem under the heading " Account of a Visit From St. Nicholas . " A prefatory editor 's note confessed , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " The poem , better known today as " The Night Before Christmas , " was an instant hit , and the Sentinel , along with other newspapers , began reprinting it every Christmas . In January 1829 , responding to a query about who wrote the poem , the Sentinel described its author as " a gentleman of more merit as a scholar and a writer than many more of more noisy pretensions . " For those who were stumped by the Sentinel 's word games , an 1837 anthology finally identified the poet , an affluent New York City landowner and classical scholar named Clement Clarke Moore . <p> Moore made an unlikely composer of doggerel . His previously published works included America 's first Hebrew lexicon , a refutation of Thomas Jefferson 's religious views , an inquiry into America 's foreign shipping trade , and a translation from the French of Alexandre Henri Tessier 's A Complete Treatise on Merinos and Other Sheep . Moore wrote most of " A Visit From St. Nicholas " while shopping for a turkey on Christmas Eve 1822 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recited it to his family . A houseguest , Harriet Butler , of Troy , asked permission to copy the poem , and the next Christmas it appeared in her hometown paper . <p> Moore 's poem added several important features to the traditional St. Nicholas legend , a centuries-old accretion of religious stories and pagan myths . In 1809 Washington Irving had introduced the idea of a benevolent gift-bearing St. Nicholas flying through the air in a wagon . An 1821 children 's book published by a friend of Moore had pictured " Santeclaus " in a flying sleigh pulled by a single reindeer . Moore increased the number of deer to eight ( which is much more plausible ) and gave them names . He also introduced Santa 's familiar ruddy cheeks , red nose , white beard , and large belly , modeling his features after those of an old Dutchman who lived nearby . <p> In Moore 's version the reindeer flew only when they needed to get up to the roof ; otherwise they pulled the sleigh along the ground . Bright children may have wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the brightest ones surely realized that grown-ups do many things that do n't make sense . In any case Santa 's unnecessarily dramatic mode of entry required him to be the size of an elf , which accounts for the poem 's " miniature sleigh " and " tiny reindeer . " Indeed , most nineteenth-century illustrators drew a doll-size Santa Claus until the jumbo , roly-poly Thomas Nast version began to take shape in the 1860s . How such a runt could carry gifts much larger than a Cracker Jack prize was never explained , but here again , sharp children were wise enough not to question the source of their wealth . <p> Over the years Moore 's sturdy epic has been parodied with slang , dialect , and foreign-language variants ; nights after Christmas ; nights before Hanukkah and Kwanzaa ; political and topical satires ; musical adaptations ; and innumerable versions of the poem as this or that famous person would have written it . In the last category is a memorable prose version written by James Thurber in the style of Ernest Hemingway ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some guy , ' I said . ' A little guy . ' " ) . The secret of its continued popularity , perhaps , is that most people encounter it for the first time when they are too young to be jaded . Though Moore did not object to the unexpected fame that his spur-of-the-moment composition brought , it is ironic that a man of his scholarly accomplishments is remembered for something so whimsical  --  and that the deeply religious Moore , who endowed a theological seminary and a number of churches , created one of the most inescapable elements of our modern secular Christmas . <p> This issue 's " The Time Machine , " plus additional anniversaries not included here , is available on the World Wide Web at **25;1226;TOOLONG timemachine . <p> By Frederic D.
