<p> Mary Donahue had been happily married for 16 years when her husband died suddenly . <p> Donahue was left with two children , ages 10 and 15 , a part-time therapy practice and absolutely no idea of her family 's financial situation - something she says is alarmingly common for women . <p> Her husband had tried to involve her . But every time he suggested she go with him to see their financial planner , Donahue told her husband she was too busy and to handle it himself . <p> " " We had made the decision that we needed to go to a family planner , and I had gone on the first visit . We both liked the woman we had picked , " she said . " " But even though he had encouraged me to go back , I told him I had enough to do . <p> Emotionally and psychologically I resisted , and he allowed me to do that . My dad had always taken care of me , and then my husband had - it was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial illiterates out there . " <p> Fortunately for Donahue , as soon as she got past the initial shock of her husband 's death , she headed straight to their financial planner , Alexandra Armstrong . Thirteen years later the two women co-authored a book stemming from Donahue 's experiences . <p> " On Your Own : A Widow 's Passage to Emotional and Financial Well-Being " ( Dearborn , $ 19.95 ) looks at both the emotional and financial sides of losing your spouse . Like it or not , the two elements go hand-in-hand , both women say . <p> " " The less fear and panic you have about what will happen and the more secure you are about your financial situation , the better able you are to get through the grieving process , " Donahue said . <p> Donahue , a psychologist , now has a successful private practice in Washington , D.C. , and two grown daughters whom she put through college . At 60 , she is the image of the confident career woman , one who helps other widows deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was quite a different person . <p> " " I had a part-time practice , and I knew that had to change , " Donahue recalls . " " But I just could n't make a decision . I kept wondering what my husband would want me to do . Finally , out of frustration , Alex turned to me and said : ' Mary , you make decisions in your work every day . What prevents you from making it in this area ? ' From then on , I knew I had to take control . " <p> Armstrong drew from her own experience for the book as well . <p> Her mother was widowed when she was 48 and Armstrong was 8 . Her father had been ill for some time , and that had depleted the family 's resources . But her mother had a small trust fund that was set up by Armstrong 's grandfather , and they made it to the end of the month . When the checks stopped coming , they discovered that the manager of the fund had embezzled money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of women 's groups and you would be surprised at how many women come up to me afterward and say : ' That happened to my mother . ' But it does n't have to . Finances do n't have to be that complicated , and you can even end up enjoying it , " Armstrong said . <p> In " On Your Own , " Armstrong and Donahue decided to do a composite of four women , based on the experiences of some of their clients who lost their husbands at very different ages and in varied situations : Diane , 42 , a nonworking mother of three children , whose lawyer husband died suddenly of a heart attack ; Susan , a 50-year-old career woman whose husband died in an auto accident ; Audrey , 62 , who lost her husband of 42 years to lung cancer ; and Elizabeth , 75 . <p> " " We have heard stories of women who did nothing for 30 years and all of a sudden after losing their spouse , did all these things , " Donahue said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have wished to lose them . But they worked hard to make their lives positive . " Armstrong and Donahue follow the four women over a 10-year period and show them at different points in the grieving and financial processes as they slowly take control of their lives . The book provides advice on everything from finding widows ' support groups to planning for your children 's education , making new friends , keeping old ones and getting remarried . Included is a psychological profile to help widows determine how to establish a new life . <p> " On Your Own " also takes the reader step-by-step financially with a guide of whom to contact at the bank , the insurance company and your husband 's office as well as the facts you need to get from them ; a checklist of 25 key files to set up ; the basic rules of investing ; and ways to calculate net worth and develop a meaningful budget and a long-term financial plan . <p> " " We hope to demystify the whole process for women , " Donahue said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so women could do a lot of the work on their own , before heading to a financial planner , lawyer or accountant and paying top dollar , " Armstrong said . " " When you 've done the basics , a financial planner can help you identify realistic long-term goals and immediate needs . " <p> Sadly , they say , many women go through their insurance money in as little as two years . One of the worst decisions a widow can make , they say , is to move right away . Both advise not making any major changes right after a husband 's death , but waiting at least three months before selling the house or deciding to relocate . Many widows are tempted to pay off their mortgage , but that is not always a good idea , the authors say , because it may be needed for a tax deduction . <p> Armstrong and Donahue spent two years writing the book on weekends . Donahue wrote the chapters dealing with the emotional side , and Armstrong wrote the financial chapters . <p> Each critiqued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her , ' I do n't understand what self-actualization means , ' and she would say , ' Well , I do n't understand what you mean when you say running the numbers , ' " Armstrong laughed . <p> " " And then we would go home and rewrite it so people could understand . We decided that if we did n't understand , the readers certainly would n't . " <p> Both feel the book is good for women of all ages and not just for the 12 million American women who are widows . <p> " " Women can be more fiscally responsible , and if they are , it will make their lives better , " Armstrong said . " " If you have a crisis , you can deal with it a lot better if you are financially aware . Younger women are getting much better at it , and maybe in 20 years there wo n't be a need for this book . <p> But there certainly is now . "
