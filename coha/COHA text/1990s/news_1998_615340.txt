<p> Betty Wilcher of Sandersville says she 's having a hard time figuring out which natural gas company in Georgia will give her the best deal . <p> " The bottom line is you want to know which one is going to save you money on your bill , " Wilcher said Thursday . " It could make a difference if you 're on a fixed income . " <p> But she 's increasingly confused and frustrated by offers coming from companies certified to sell natural gas now that the industry has been deregulated in the state . <p> And she 's not alone . <p> Marketers ' call centers in Atlanta , Syracuse , N.Y. , Charleston , S.C. , and Toronto have been buzzing this week with inquiries from consumers trying to figure out who 's offering what , and at what cost . The state Public Service Commission says it has been receiving 100 calls a day , more than at any time since emotional public hearings concerning Georgia Power Co. ' s Plant Vogtle nuclear plant 15 years ago . <p> But despite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not that much separates the offers . An analysis of prices for an average November bill quoted by seven leading marketers shows a difference of less than $ 10 between the highest and lowest monthly charge , with most within $ 2 of one another . <p> What may matter the most to consumers is to what extent competitors are willing to guarantee rates in the future , given the volatility of wholesale gas prices . In addition , marketers themselves say consumers may base decisions on which competitor they think is the most reliable . Deborah Latham , president of Roswell-based Peachtree Natural Gas , one of 19 marketers certified to sell gas in Georgia , compared the process to negotiating car repairs with a mechanic . " I do n't have a clue what he 's talking about , so I just go to someone I trust , " Latham said . <p> Since Georgia 's gas deregulation law went into effect Nov. 1 , about 1 percent of 1.4 million Atlanta Gas Light Co. customers eligible to buy gas from an alternate supplier have opted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice will eventually be assigned to a marketer at random by the Public Service Commission . <p> Atlanta Gas Light customers will see noticeable changes in their bills in the months ahead , since the company 's gas service rates no longer are controlled by the Public Service Commission . ( The PSC now only regulates AGL 's charges for delivering gas . ) Thousands of consumers are expected to choose marketers soon as temperatures plunge and they pay more attention to their heating bills . Interest will also be sparked when marketers turn up the temperature on advertising and promotional campaigns in the coming weeks . So far , consumers have been bombarded with a wide variety of claims for gas bill savings and promotional gimmicks reminiscent of the early days of telecommunications deregulation . Among them : South Carolina-based SCANA Energy is offering new customers $ 50 worth of free gas or $ 50 gift certificates for groceries for those who sign up at SCANA stands at Kroger supermarkets . Columbia offers home energy audit computer software worth $ 60 . Shell offers a home safety kit or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week launched a joint marketing deal for 25,000 Amway distributors in Georgia to tout Columbia 's gas service when the sales reps sell cosmetics and detergents door-to-door . <p> Everyone promises savings . United Gas Management , an affiliate of a Canadian energy company , promises a 10 percent savings on gas usage plus a 15 percent savings on base charges for delivery of the gas to homes . Georgia Natural Gas Services , the marketing affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light , offers a 12 percent savings on delivery charges . Columbia Energy promises an 18 percent savings on gas and SCANA , 5 percent . Shell also promises to lock in its rate for one year , United Gas for three years . Georgia Natural Gas will lock in a rate for one year but at a rate that is higher than its November rate . Most other players say future prices will continue to be subject to wholesale price fluctuations . <p> So consumers will be faced with choices similar to those when choosing between fixed rate and variable rate mortgages . A major source of confusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas bills . Under the state 's new law , marketers can charge whatever they want for gas . But they must pay Atlanta Gas Light a long list of regulated charges for such things as delivering and storing gas , meter reading , renting capacity on interstate pipelines , replenishing a fund to pay marketers for uncollectable accounts and the gas company 's public education campaign about deregulation . Those charges come to about $ 22 a month for the average residential account . The rest of the bill is for the gas itself . For a marketer to calculate that cost , it has to take into account a customer 's " Dedicated Design Day Capacity , " which measures how much gas a home or residence will require on the coldest day of the year . But marketers need the statistic to make their calculation , and they report difficulty in obtaining it . Atlanta Gas Light does n't plan to start listing the capacity figure on bills until January . Next year , marketers will also get broader access to consumer information from Atlanta Gas Light that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marketers were thrown for a loop this week when Atlanta Gas Light published the rates it plans to charge for gas itself during the transition to deregulation  --  a charge separate from regulated delivery charges . Marketers that had planned to base their rates on particular savings from Atlanta Gas Light 's said the company 's formula was too much of a moving target for them to use as a benchmark . " It throws our pricing off , no two ways about it , " said Randy S. Michael , SCANA 's manager of Georgia operations . Instead of immediate 5 percent savings , SCANA is promising the savings over a 12-month period . Shell Energy Services abandoned an offer of 10 percent below Atlanta Gas Light 's rates , said Tim Sheehan , Georgia marketing manager for the Texas company , because AGL 's rates " were all over the board . " The company is now offering a rate that is guaranteed for one year . <p> Atlanta Gas Light 's new gas rates came months after the company adopted a new formula for its charges for delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those charges were pegged to monthly gas usage . Consumers accustomed to low summer rates were subjected to rate shock in July , prompting the PSC to order a rate rollback . Now , however , consumers who use low levels of gas are expected to see an upturn on their gas charges this winter . " We 're concerned that the smaller users could once again see increases , " said PSC member Lauren McDonald . He added that the commission could step in again if Atlanta Gas Light 's rates " get too out of line . " Atlanta Gas Light President Paula Rosput said the utility made the changes to protect itself against risks as an unregulated company . She said AGL is aiming to " make unregulated sales indistinguishable " from last year 's rates and to withdraw from gas sales as soon as possible . <p> " We 're not trying to profit from the sale of gas , " she insisted . " It 's confusing to the consumer , but what are we supposed to do ? " <p> Despite all the promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 's skeptical . Frazier said he has heard claims by marketers that they will save their customers 5 percent or 6 percent , " but until you get their bill how will you know ?
