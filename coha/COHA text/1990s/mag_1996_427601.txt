<p> If you think the world 's biggest software company is powerful now , you have n't seen anything yet . Bill Gates and his legions of overachievers are headed for your house , your car and your wallet . <p> <p> THE RICHEST MAN IN AMERICA IS IN a very good mood . And why not ? It 's not quite a year since William Henry Gates III addressed a crowd on Pearl Harbor Day , 1995 , and vowed to remake a company that many thought was a digital has-been . He has transformed Microsoft , the globe 's biggest software company  --  turning a battleship around as if it were a PT boat , ' says one of his awed crewmen  --  and though his foes in the theater of operations known as the Internet are still afloat , the outcome of that futuristic conflagration is now as clear as the rare November sunshine pouring through his window in Microsoft 's arboreal Redmond , Wash. , campus : his company has prevailed . We came through on the things we said we 'd do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Far from hampering Microsoft 's progress , the Internet has turbocharged it . Revitalized by its cyberspace initiative , the company is ready to gobble up the limitless opportunities that will come from the Net 's restructuring of commerce itself . Just as U.S. Steel and General Motors had their time , this moment belongs to the 41-year-old multi-billionaire rocking back and forth on a couch in his office . Welcome to the Microsoft Century . <p> Some think he 's an evil emperor , the digital king of darkness . There are entire Web sites devoted to his demonization . But Bill Gates will tell you his goals straight out . Microsoft is butting against the limits of how much it can grow in the desktop-computer field ; its answer is to make software for more kinds of computers  --  for the house , the car and even the pocket . And it 's going to piggyback on the Internet to enter new businesses . You can bank with Microsoft , you can book travel with Microsoft , you can buy music from Microsoft , you can read book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and NBC ) channel . You 'll find out who 's playing at the local nightclub and book a ticket on a pocket-size wallet computer running a variant of Microsoft 's flagship Windows software . People may find themselves brushing against Microsoft often , as they work , shop and entertain themselves . And at the end of the day , a Windows-based home-control system may even shut off the bedroom light . <p> Critics of its power may not want to hear this , but only now is the 21-year-old company led by the $20 billion man poised to really take off . Some of its executives privately believe Microsoft could double both its size and its market valuation within the next five years . This would make it the most valuable firm on the planet . But even that would not begin to address the strength and breadth of an entity that sits at the hub of the information revolution . <p> It 's difficult to think of a company in the history of the world that 's positioned to influence so many aspects of life as Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Michael Moritz , a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park , Calif . In terms of a civilized world , you 'd have to go back to the Roman Empire to find any organization that had as great a reach as Microsoft has today . ' <p> For a look at Microsoft 's status in high tech , check out its spread at last week 's Comdex . Pilgrims flocking to the Las Vegas Uber-computer event entered the main hall to be swallowed by Microsoft 's 40,000-square-foot display . As a dozen giant video displays beamed screen shots , people jammed 30-deep to watch a demo of a new software product , Office 97 . All you could see was Microsoft . <p> And all people could talk about was how Microsoft had answered the doubters who claimed it was insufficiently nimble to maintain its strength in an Internet world . Upstart Netscape had claimed it would break Microsoft 's chokehold ( its boy wonder Marc Andreessen was saying just months ago that one day people would be asking what that Windows thing was all about ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for software to browse the exciting World Wide Web . That was a bullet with our name on it , ' says Microsoft vice president Paul Maritz . <p> But Microsoft had some not-so-secret weapons . Chief among them was its megamotivated CEO . Once Gates recognized the gravity of the threat , he spun off a series of memos that turned the company around . And then there was Microsoft 's work force , a Kingdome-full of mini-Bills . We have 20,000 overachievers , ' says Mike Murray , VP of human resources , who goes through 15,000 rEsumEs to hire about 200 nerd kamikazes every month . <p> But Microsoft 's biggest advantage was the one that many Internet observers considered irrelevant : the fact that almost every computer used a Microsoft operating system and most people used Microsoft applications . So while it was essential for Microsoft to ramp up its own Explorer browser and spiff up its applications for the Net , the masterstroke came when Microsoft leveraged its pre-existing leadership by integrating the browser into the operating system . This meant that new computer buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet , Microsoft style . What 's more , the extension of this idea into something called the Active Desktop , due next year , actually puts Microsoft ahead in presenting a new approach to computing , where one handles information as if cruising on the Web . It 's a gambit for which its competitors have no sure response . <p> Now the new Microsoft has what might be a more formidable task : extending throughout the world the type of ubiquity that Comdex-goers saw . The post- Browser War Microsoft has several businesses : <p> Platforms and applications . More than 90 percent of all PCs have a Microsoft operating system  --  the software that allows the computer to perform its life functions  --  most commonly a form of Windows . Microsoft also rules in applications : word processing , spreadsheets and the like . Its position is so secure in the microcomputer universe that it thinks about its sales in terms of how many dollars it gets for every computer sold ( about a hundred bucks ) . <p> Problem : there are only so many desktops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new kinds of computers . Take the handheld PC , ' says Steve Ballmer , Bill 's key lieutenant , himself a multibillionaire . Ballmer is referring to palm-size devices that run on Windows CE , just rolled out at Comdex . We 're going to make a royalty , let 's say between five and 25 bucks . A few million units a year  --  that 's not a bad business . If the number is 20 or 30 million . . . ' <p> Ballmer is just warming up AutoPC ! ' he says . It 's yet another version of Windows that will run dashboard-based computers with maps , global positioning and Internet connectivity . If we could figure out a way to get 10 or 20 bucks a car , that would be a pretty good business . ' <p> Next ? Home PC ! Picture the family homestead as a computer net , with a server ( a computer that runs a network ) in the basement , connected to perhaps dozens of computing devices throughout the house . Kitchen PCs , phone PCs , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heating system and the lights . All linked to the In- ternet . And all running Windows . <p> Getting this close to the customer could lead to an intimate and on-going ' relationship , says Gates . The easy way to do that is the concept of membership . We ask you to register , and if you 're willing we 'll upload from your hard disk a few profile bits about how you 're using the applications and what your hardware is . In a sense , we 'll go from a mass production-type world to where we 're using the Internet to customize our communication . ' And every month you 'll pay the Bill . <p> Servers . The fastest-growing field in software is the corporate-network , or intranet , market . Even though this is where Microsoft 's most voracious challengers have staked their claims  --  Netscape and Sun in the server market and Oracle as the database king  --  most observers think that it has a chance to grab the lion 's share . Its key advantage is that virtually every large company already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations is to adopt Microsoft 's Windows NT business systems . By 2000 or 2001 , this part of the business will be equal to Microsoft 's entire current business , ' says Scott Winkler , a Gartner Group analyst . That 's 8 billion smackers . Netscape and Sun both have sound plans to get pieces of that market , but they are wrestling with a gorilla . <p> Content . Pete Higgins , Microsoft 's media czar , claims this unit  --  which ranges from the online service Microsoft Network ( MSN ) to CD-ROM games to electronic publications like Sidewalk ( an interactive equivalent of the local entertainment weekly )  --  will become a billion-dollar business . But Gates has higher expectations for the division . It could be our biggest , ' he says . This would make Microsoft a media company as big as Gannett , but , Gates warns , first the company will have to absorb some huge losses . Since the company has $7 billion in cash , this is not a huge problem . <p> Microsoft now has an entire campus devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artificial waterfall . Encarta , the world 's most popular encyclopedia , is produced there , as well as flashy games ( Microsoft Monster Trucks ! ) and magazines including Michael Kinsley 's Slate , a Gen-X thing called Mint and a hip women 's Web site called UnderWire . Skeptics say that a techie company ca n't compete against Disney , but the creative types in Redmond are n't buying that . We talk about it being the studio of the 21st century , ' says MSN content chief Bob Bejan . <p> Microsoft understands that magazines are not as profitable as operating systems , but there are other benefits . These ventures will provide Microsoft a constant connection with its users . And with the Active Desktop approach , Microsoft content could merge into the experience of using any of the various devices powered by Microsoft . You could get a Kinsley column from the kitchen , a stock ticker running in the car or Tom Brokaw in your wallet . At every step the Microsoft juggernaut , with your permission , could be retaining certain of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your needs . Did you just buy a Nancy Griffith CD from Music Central ? Sidewalk has learned she 's performing in your town next week ! Been perusing the skinny on Bali vacations on the Microsoft 's Mungo Park electronic ' zine ? Guess what  --  the Expedia travel service offers discounts on flights there ! <p> Currently , the greatest competitive challenge to Microsoft comes from Sun Microsystems , Netscape and Oracle . Their vision is centered on the Java computer language and so-called network computers  --  low-cost diskless machines connected to the Net . But so far the market for these seems limited , at least until people can count on reliable , high-speed connections that will zip information to these machines from big servers . <p> One selling point is that these products are worth using simply to stop Microsoft . The person who spends serious money for software wants choices and realizes it 's in his advantage to spread the money around  --  this benefits us , ' says Jim Barksdale , Netscape 's CEO . Sun 's Scott McNealy casts it in near-apocalyptic terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Redmond , who live on the Death Star , and the rest of us , the rebel forces . ' Oracle 's CEO , Larry Ellison , says flatly , Everybody hates Microsoft . ' But the fact is that plenty of people do n't hate Microsoft . The business community generally accepts it as a fact of life , albeit one with sometimes bloated , hard-to-use applications . The general public , charmed in part by Gates 's tousled high-tech Horatio Alger role , figures that Microsoft is part of the future , to be viewed as a mix of scary inevitability and Jetsons ' ' - style frisson . <p> So Microsoft 's competitors are playing another card : antitrust . In part , the arguments deal with Microsoft 's bigness . They 're going to have the computer , the car , the telephone and the television  --  all in one day , ' says Gary Reback , the lawyer who filed a complaint on Netscape 's behalf . You may as well send your paycheck to Bill Gates ! Did you ever vote for this guy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft rules operating systems while also developing applications . It 's as if someone owned all the train rails while com- peting with others in producing the locomotives that run on the rails . Who 's best informed on what gauge the next generation of rails might be ? <p> So you have a company like Corel , Microsoft 's main competitor in applications , forced to deal with Microsoft to get information on the equivalent of rail information . Corel 's CEO , Mike Cowpland , claims , They became very uncooperative on the engineering side ' once Corel took on a product that competed with Microsoft Office . We can still develop the software , but it 's slightly more inconvenient because we have to do more work ourselves . ' Netscape founder Jim Clark says his company has the same problem . Imagine a foot race where your opponent can put a little pebble in your path and give you a slight cause to stumble , ' he says . They win , and no one ever knows . ' ( Microsoft says it does n't intentionally freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the problem is obvious : You have to break Microsoft into two parts . ' <p> Yet Microsoft professes confidence that government scrutiny will yield as little result as previous forays , including a major effort from former antitrust head Ann Bingaman that led to a virtual hand slap . We 're extremely careful in how we do business , ' says Gates . Indeed , antitrust law does not prohibit bigness . But Microsoft also realizes that its ambitious plans will guarantee that the government will continue its close scrutiny . Microsoft is the most successful company in the most dazzling new industry of the century , ' says Charles Rule , Ronald Reagan 's antitrust czar . This made Microsoft into Ann Bingaman 's white whale , and it will continue to attract her successors . ' Will any of this hobble Microsoft ? That 's not going to happen , ' Gates promises . <p> At least one charge that Microsoft 's detractors make  --  that if allowed to maintain its grip on the industry the company will skimp on innovation  --  seems unfounded . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products generally broke little ground . But more recently , Microsoft has moved to become as aggressive an innovator as it is a competitor . <p> The heart of this initiative is its five-year-old research group . It was the brainstorm of Nathan Myhrvold , a physicist turned Microsoft VP who was once Stephen Hawking 's assistant . In terms of research , people were n't focusing on the personal computer , ' he says . One reason was the bottom line : the history of high-tech think tanks reads like Custer 's war record . The most famous example was Xerox , whose research group did pioneering work that was ignored by the company and exploited elsewhere . <p> Yet Microsoft believed it could succeed . It hired the very best in every field . At first this was not easy . I asked myself , Why would I work for a DOS company ? ' ' says former professor Rick Rashid , who now heads the lab . ( Would Giorgio Armani sign up for a full-time gig at Wal-Mart ? ) But Rashid discovered that the product groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resource- ful people who could deal with the researchers as peers . The executives were even smarter . You 'll go to Bill , and he will have read the latest research in your area , ' says Rashid . It 's really startling . This guy is the CEO of the company  --  and he gets it . ' <p> Perhaps the best example of how Microsoft research may improve the state of computing while widening its competitive advantage is the lab 's work in computer graphics . Microsoft hired a wizard dream team  --  in the subculture that worships polygons and rasters the names Jim Kajiya , Alvy Ray Smith and Jim Blinn resonate like Cruise , Brando and Madonna . They set about rethinking the basic way that computers process images at high speed and came up with Talisman , a new system that delivers , Myhrvold claims , a 100-fold improvement in speed . It will totally revolutionize PC graphics , ' he gushes . <p> Microsoft will fully exploit this breakthrough . In about a year , a new graphics card ( a circuit board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now found inside all Windows machines , visually supercharging the desktop and the Net . You can be sure that a new version of Windows and a future upgrade of Office will be redesigned around Talisman . Side-by-side comparison with competitors ' software will look like the difference betweeen spreadsheets and Space Jam . ' Now imagine the same process with other research breakthroughs , like speech recognition and talking computers . <p> In other words , Microsoft now intends to add radical innovation to its basic weaponry , backed up by a $2 billion annual budget for R &D.; What grim news for competitors . But to Microsoft this outcome is the very definition of fairness . If people who do n't have research criticize us for getting an edge by way of our research , that 's ridiculous , ' says Myhrvold . <p> Is the Microsoft Century inevitable ? Even as they draw up blueprints for ubiquity , the Microsoft people themselves insist that their position is not ensured . Their ideology insists that there will always be another huge competitor , even if their most formidable nemesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' In 1981 it looked like IBM would rule the world , and then IBM fell apart . Stories like this abound , ' says Robert Sobel , a Hofstra University economist . Those stories haunt Bill Gates , and he is determined not to become one of them . The IBM lesson is cautionary to us , ' he says . Almost every day we say , Have we become them ? ' ' <p> No , Microsoft is not them . Not as far as getting complacent . But as its power grows and its digital fingers encircle us all , it might be Microsoft 's greatest challenge not to become a them as far as its users are concerned . Gates says he 'd like Microsoft to be remembered as an agent of the empowering force of computers , a company that was driving that forward . ' But the flagship companies of former eras are often recalled less for their innovations than for their distance from , or even hostility toward , the common citizen . Will the Microsoft Century be different ? Or will our lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill ? 1997 <p> As early as next year , your computer will be more ' active , ' bringing you the information you want automatically . 1999 <p> Movie  --  quality graphics will let you create memos , spreadsheets and e-mail that look more like ' Space Jam ' than work . 2001 <p> Computers everywhere  --  from the kitchen to your pocket .
