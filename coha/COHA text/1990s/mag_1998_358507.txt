Mott Street in Little Italy , Manhattan 's newest locus of hip , is where modish factions of the young professional class gather in cafes to talk about movies starring Steve Buscemi and to chain-smoke as though it were Milan or 1956 . Mott Street is , in other words , a place you might envision as fashion 's capital of spartan black . On a northern tip , though , sits a tiny 1 1/2-year-old shop named Calypso , where , on any given weekend , stylish young shoppers slither past one another to get at a collection of near-sheer pastel sweaters , lacy skirts , candy-colored coats and dusty blue slip dresses , coquettish clothes ( most by little known designers ) meant to let any suitor know that the woman in them does n't call first and never goes dutch . <P> While fashion for most of the decade has been dominated by the spare chic of designers like Prada and Jil Sander , this season it finds itself in the midst of a full-scale romance revival , and women seem to be smitten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tocca , a label specializing in girlish party dresses that began with a collection of 11 pieces in 1994 , has evolved into a multimillion-dollar business . Jewelry is having a renaissance . " We 're just all so tired of looking plain , " notes Andrea Linett , a fashion writer at Harper 's Bazaar and a Calypso regular . " The new version of a white T shirt and khakis is a camisole and sexy , fitted trousers . Femininity now signifies the urban look . " <P> And that is perhaps how the French have always wished it . Fashion 's new womanliness has its most passionate and celebrated advocates in two young designers brought in to revivify a pair of Parisian houses famously steeped in the romantic tradition . Alber Elbaz , the creative director of Guy Laroche , and Stella McCartney , daughter of Paul and Linda and the new chief talent at Chloe , have become stars of the fashion world , with spring ready-to-wear lines aimed at women whose idea of time well spent extends beyond eating dinner at their desks . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodman this winter , it sold so quickly that the clothes had to be removed from the racks so there would be enough merchandise left when its designer came for a promotional event in February . <P> When McCartney was installed at the house to much fanfare last year , critics of the move attributed it to her lineage . Chief among the detractors was her predecessor , Karl Lagerfeld , who snapped to Women 's Wear Daily , " I think they should have taken a big name . They did  --  but in music , not fashion . " McCartney , despite her age ( she is 26 ) , was in fact no novice to garmentmaking . She had attended London 's venerable Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design , the alma mater as well of John Galliano and Alexander McQueen ( designers also snatched up to oversee ailing French houses ) . For extra training during her school years , she served as a tailor 's apprentice to learn the art of Savile Row suitmaking.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
