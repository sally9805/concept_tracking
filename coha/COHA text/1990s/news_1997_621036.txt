<p> GOP IS GOBBLING UP ' SOFT MONEY ' TOO <p> Editor  --  Your July 14 editorial , " Campaign Reform Hypocrisy , " attacks President Clinton 's efforts to raise legal " soft money " for the Democratic National Committee while advocating abolition of the practice . On the surface the charge seems justified , but closer scrutiny shows the DNC leadership has several times urged the Republican National Committee to join Democrats in bilaterally abolishing " soft money " contributions . The DNC has encountered only silence or obfuscation . <p> President Clinton , the Democratic congressional leadership and the DNC have consistently and vigorously called for strong limits on the use of " soft money " by supporting the passage of the bipartisn McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill . The Republican congressional majority has for over a year kept this legislation from coming to a vote on the floors of the House and the Senate . Your editorial also fails to note that Republicans , since the close of the 1996 campaign , have raised $ 17 million in " soft money . " <p> Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " soft money " fund-raising and believe it can remain competitive with its ideological adversary . As long as the Republicans continue to block campaign finance reform , the DNC has no other realistic choice but to ask the president to help raise legal hard and " soft money .

Ward Connerly does n't like the idea and Jesse Jackson says it has no substantive value . But a Clinton apology for some of his own actions might find ready takers . <p> Lani Guinier , for example , might welcome an apology , as might gays and lesbians in the military who believe he let them down . <p> Others could include : children deprived of aid by Clinton 's signing of the welfare " reform " bill ; economic victims of Clinton 's disastrous NAFTA policy ; Cubans victimized by Clinton 's blockade ; the families of thousands of Iraqi children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the poor of Haiti and other Third World countries , victims of Clinton 's support of " structural adjustment " programs ; and , while he is at it , he might apologize for letting Janet Reno authorize the " Waco Massacre , " a tragic blunder that succeeded only in polarizing the American people . <p> Yes , in the eyes of some people , Bill Clinton may have a lot to apologize for . <p> RAYMOND GIRAUD <p> Palo Alto <p> . <p> NORTHERN IRELAND 'S FUTURE <p> Editor  --  Brendan Reilly disputed the claim in a recent Chronicle editorial ( Letters , May 31 ) that the arrival of Prime Minister Blair is an " encouraging sign for Ireland . " Mr. Reilly did not like Mr. Blair 's insistence that Irish nationalism " commit itself to politics alone . " He meant there was no place for violence in shaping the future of Northern Ire land . The key point is that the governments of the United States , Ireland and the U.S. all accept the principle of consent in the North . Those , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland to bloodshed , and frustrate a reconciliation from which , in time , their aspirations might be met . <p> Mr. Reilly also claimed that Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness had been " denied from taking their seats . " Not true . The choice was theirs . Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuiness refused to take the oath of allegiance . If you wo n't take the oath , you can not take your seat . <p> KEVIN P. COOK <p> Vice Consul <p> Press and Public Affairs <p> British Consulate-General <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CAMPBELL BASHING <p> Editor  --  Republican Representative Tom Campbell a centrist ? Baloney ! Tom Campbell is a flat-out Democrat liberal . He always has been , always will be . Not one time while he was in Sacramento did he ever vote in accordance with the Republican platform principles . He never votes for Republican platform in Washington . <p> He has clothed himself in " Republican " because of all the Republicans registered in the district . He 's a whore . <p> The University of Chicago is great for producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations . <p> GEORGE SCHNEIER <p> Oakland <p> . <p> WELCOMING THE DE YOUNG <p> Editor  --  North Beach Neighbors has become the first neighborhood organization to welcome the de Young museum to its new home on The Embarcadero . We appreciate the difficulty of the museum trustees ' decision to move from Golden Gate Park , but we believe it was a decision which can give San Francisco a world-class museum for the next century . <p> Attendance at the de Young has been stagnant for years . As their excellent consultant 's report made clear , the museum must move to a location which is more accessible if it is to prosper . Surprisingly , about 80 percent of museum patrons come from out side San Francisco . For that half of the total who come from the greater Bay Area and for our schoolchildren throughout the city , The Embarcadero site will be much easier to reach by public transit or car . <p> The consultant 's report documented that only a tiny percentage of museum-goers combine active use of the park with their visit to the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a park , set one landscaped half- block from Herb Caen Way , with spectacular views of the bay . North Beach Neighbors is proud to welcome the de Young to a new location where it can greatly enrich us all . <p> JAMES NORWOOD PRATT <p> North Beach Neighbors <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> NORTH BEACH PARKING <p> Editor  --  This city , and especially the Parking and Traffic Commission , has lost its mind . According to Matier &; Ross ( Chronicle , June 16 ) , San Francisco would rather lose 100 " prime " parking places than pass on three or four jobs , in a part of the city that needs every available parking place it can find . The parking garage union must wield some mighty power against Mayor Brown . <p> With the loss of 100 parking places , the businesses in North Beach will lose countless paying customers each and every day and night . How many restaurants could open ? How much tax revenue is lost ? How many cooks , waiters , dish washers , food suppliers , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking jobs ? The decision not to build the most feasible parking garage in a very densely populated area is insane . <p> JULIE WHITSITT <p> Orinda <p> . <p> LEARNING VS . THEME PARKS <p> Editor  --  We can thank the domestic partners ' law for revealing that the Recreation and Park Department spends over $ 210,000 a year to send kids to theme parks during the summer months . This indicates the most feeble interpretation of the word " recreation " and a pathetic lack of resourcefulness . <p> I ca n't help wondering what one of San Francisco 's more creative and dedicated teachers would do with that amount of money for a summer program . Visiting a theme park is forgotten very soon , learning new skills is n't . <p> KAREN CROMMIE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> LAS VEGAS IN THE CITY <p> Editor  --  Regarding that new $ 500 million casino in Las Vegas . First they built a replica of an Italian village . Then ancient Egypt ! Then the " Wizard of Oz " and Monte Carlo and New York , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a resort . Enough is enough ! <p> Let 's slow down the millions of dollars of tourist and gaming money flowing from California to Nevada . The mayor should launch a study of creating a super billion-dollar casino/resort/hotel in San Francisco with a grand , gaudy theme of Las Vegas , itself ! It 'll be great fun , and we 'll beat Las Vegas at its own game . <p> HAL LAYER <p> San Francisco
