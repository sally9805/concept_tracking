<p> On a sunny Saturday at the end of June , this sleepy New England college town has been stripped of students . The rolling lawns look a bit lonely . Most of the buildings at Williams College stand quietly behind their classical Greek columns , closed up like pocket watches . <p> Everywhere you turn , though , there seem to be theater people . Crowds form outside the Adams Memorial Theater , which houses the Williamstown Theater Festival 's two stages . In Tennessee Williams 's play " The Milk Train Does n't Stop Here Anymore , " Olympia Dukakis staggers around the mainstage in Kabuki clogs as the legendary actress Flora Goforth . She air-kisses Mary Louise Wilson , who has barely changed out of the Diana Vreeland drag she sported last season in her award-winning impersonation , " Full Gallop . " <p> At a coffee shop nearby , cast members from the festival 's Other Stage revival of Jon Robin Baitz 's corrosive comedy " The End of the Day " converge for breakfast . They include David Marshall Grant , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Claudia Shear , in her first major appearance since her successful one-woman show Off Broadway , " Blown Sideways Through Life . " <p> Their director , Scott Elliott , who received glowing notices for his work in the Off Broadway plays " Ecstasy , " " The Monogamist " and " Curtains , " is holed up in a church basement on the grounds of the college . He is staging the American premiere of " The Ride Down Mount Morgan , " a dramatic comedy by Arthur Miller . The cast includes F. Murray Abraham , Michael Learned , Patricia Clarkson and Adina Porter , who had the title role in Suzan-Lori Parks 's recent " Venus " at the Public Theater . <p> Later , at a local restaurant , Andrea Martin , who just finished her one-woman show , " Nude Nude Totally Nude , " at the Public Theater , and Victor Garber , late of Tom Stoppard 's " Arcadia , " meet for dinner on a break from rehearsals of " The Royal Family , " the comedy by George S. Kaufman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which also stars Blythe Danner , Marian Seldes and Kate Burton , is an opportunity , Ms. Martin notes , for watching " some serious overacting . " <p> The summer influx of New York theater people to this northwest corner of Massachusetts has been a tradition since 1955 . For years , the attraction was the indefatigable energy and personality of the Williamstown Theater Festival 's longtime artistic director , Nikos Psacharopoulos , who died in 1989 at the age of 60 . <p> What is remarkable this year , though , is that a hip , up-to-the-minute season has been snatched from the void . When Michael Ritchie , the festival 's new producer , showed up for his first day of work on Jan. 2 , " nothing was in place , " he remembered . <p> Mr. Ritchie , 38 , was an 11th-hour replacement for Peter Hunt , a longtime assistant to Mr. Psacharopoulos , who had presided over the theater since 1989 . When Mr. Hunt was suddenly and somewhat mysteriously fired by the board of trustees last September , the next season had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to schedule a full program of 11 plays in 11 weeks , five new-play readings , a solo series , a weekend cabaret and a children 's theater program based on Willie Reale 's acclaimed 52d Street Project , his own future at Williamstown is a bit of a mystery too . Will he be the stable , creative force the board says it has been seeking , or is there more turmoil to come ? <p> " It 's a big operation , " Mr. Ritchie said in a quiet office near the theater 's lobby . " And we were way behind in January . We had done no fund-raising . We had n't planned a season . We had no directors , actors , plays , staff , apprentices . Public relations-wise , Williamstown had been sitting under a cloud . Nothing was going on . " <p> The festival had been at a standstill since Sept. 10 , when Mr. Hunt received a call from the board 's lawyer at his home in Los Angeles informing him that he had been dismissed . A number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Tony Award-winning director who had worked at Williamstown for more than 30 years . <p> " I have a master 's degree from the Yale School of Drama , " Mr. Hunt , 57 , said by telephone from Los Angeles . " They 're missing one course there . It should be called Boardology . This is my own supposition : while working to keep the theater going , I neglected a lot of board protocol . The most difficult thing is that the Williamstown Theater Festival always called itself a family . As the senior member of that family , you would think that even if they wanted to give the old guy a watch and say goodbye , you 'd still be toddled out for functions . " <p> To some members of the Williamstown " family , " however , the change was not as mysterious as it seemed . " For almost 35 years , " said Robert Alpaugh , who served as managing director both before and after Mr. Psacharopoulos 's death , " Nikos woke up in the morning thinking about deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamstown , and that 's what made it work . Peter had a whole other life on the coast that he was n't able to give up , making TV movies that kept him in a life style he wanted to be in . Perhaps in the board 's eye , the festival was suffering because of that . " <p> Asked directly why Mr. Hunt was fired , Ira Lapidus , the board president , said , " The best way to interpret the board 's action is we decided not to renew his contract . " <p> After Mr. Hunt 's dismissal , a search committee pursued , among others , Jon Jory , the head of the Actors Theater of Louisville . Offered the job , Mr. Jory said he seriously considered it but ultimately turned it down . Shortly before Christmas , Mr. Ritchie was asked to produce the 1996 season . <p> " What Michael did was very smart ; he went around and hired all the hot people from the last two seasons in New York , " said David Schweizer , who directed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATIVE OF Worcester , Mass. , had made a career as a Broadway stage manager . When a 1981 production of Shaw 's " Candida " that he managed at the Kenyon Theater Festival in Ohio moved to Circle in the Square in New York , its star , Ms. Woodward , insisted that Mr. Ritchie accompany it . He stayed for several years at Circle in the Square and began to stage-manage at other theaters , including Lincoln Center and Williamstown . <p> " I loved it , " said Mr. Ritchie . " Some people think it 's a drudge job , but I loved being in the rehearsal room . I could have happily been a stage manager the rest of my life . " ( If the director is the creative parent of a production , and often disappears after opening night , the stage manager is the benevolent older sibling who maintains the quality of the show day after day . ) <p> When he was approached by the Williamstown board , " the clock was ticking , " he said . " I walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how to get from here to Labor Day , ' and I laid out my idea of what I would do . <p> " Williamstown serves four different audiences  --  the local audience , the tourist audience , the New York theater community and what people call the family . I wanted to pull together different groups that would show off the strength of the place . " <p> " There 's a big thing here with the family , " he explained . " It 's mainly the actors but there are some directors and writers . It 's the people who come back year after year . Olympia 's been coming here for 30 years . Blythe is in her 19th season . James Naughton , Maria Tucci  --  the audience here loves those people . When they go on to bigger success , the audience thrives on that . I wanted to get as much of the family together as possible this season because we were in transition . But I also wanted a real nuts-and-bolts New York theater presence . The board said , ' Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Jan. 2 , alone in the festival 's New York office , " sitting at a big blank empty desk . " He started working the phone . " My second day , Joanne Woodward called and said , ' Whatever you need , whatever you want , I 'm there . ' I said , ' What do you want to do ? ' She said , ' I have a couple of Clifford Odets plays I 'd like to direct . ' She told me which ones . I literally ran to Barnes &; Noble , across Union Square , grabbed the plays , read them , came back , called her and said , ' O.K.  --  " Rocket to the Moon . " ' " ( Ms. Woodward will direct the play on the Other Stage , starting Aug. 14 . ) <p> " Then I thought , ' I 've never done an Arthur Miller play , and I 'd like to . ' I decided to read all his plays , though in my heart I figured I would end up picking ' Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' All My Sons , ' how good it was . Then I ran into the director Austin Pendleton who said , ' You should look into " The Ride Down Mount Morgan , " it 's never been done here . ' I was really surprised by that play . So I arranged to meet with Arthur to discuss doing the two plays together . At the end of the meeting , he said : ' That sounds like a good idea . Let 's go . ' Suddenly , I had the basis of a season . " ( Barry Edelstein is directing " All My Sons " on the Other Stage , through July 21 . ) <p> IT BECAME LIKE A SNOWball , " Mr. Ritchie said . " There were almost too many choices . " Then Ms. Dukakis and Mr. Schweizer came to him with " Milk Train . " " Olympia had a five-week window of opportunity between films , " Mr. Ritchie said , " so it fell into our laps and solved the last piece of the puzzle . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritchie 's on-the-job training as stage manager turned producer . " The two are not that different , " he said . " I always felt that as a stage manager I was there to support , and I think producing is the same thing . Artists know how to do the work . Your job is to make sure they have everything they need to do it well . " <p> Mr. Ritchie brings an almost dynastic sense of family to the theater . He is married to Ms. Burton , the actress , who has spent seven summers at Williamstown and famously comes from a theatrical family : her father was Richard Burton ; her mother , Sybil Burton Christopher , co-produces the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor on Long Island . <p> As his associate producer , Mr. Ritchie has hired Jenny Gersten , a young administrator with theatrical roots : she is the daughter of Cora Cahan , president of New 42d Street , the nonprofit redevelopment agency , and Bernard Gersten , the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater . <p> The Williamstown trustees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconceive the job around Mr. Ritchie . <p> " My dream , shared by other people , is that Michael will stay on as producing director , " said Ms. Woodward , who joined the Williamstown board this year . " He 's done everything that I can possibly imagine to make it a successful season . The one thing he ca n't be is Nikos . " Heads Together , Years Apart <p> Watching F. Murray Abraham kiss his way up the leg of Patricia Clarkson 's blue jeans , the director Scott Elliott whispered : " This play is very sexy to me . It 's everything you do n't think Arthur Miller is but who he is as a human being . It 's going to make for a really 90 's theater piece . " <p> The pairing of the eminent playwright , 80 , with Mr. Elliott , 33 , the director of three critically acclaimed Off Broadway productions in the last 15 months , might seem unexpected , even quirky . Certainly , landing the American premiere of Mr. Miller 's " Ride Down Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , best known for staging classics and unknown new plays . <p> " Scott 's a very contemporary guy ; I like that , " the playwright said . Mr. Miller had mentioned his admiration for Mr. Elliott 's work to their mutual agent , Sam Cohn at ICM , who engineered the collaboration . " Scott 's full of energy and drive , and I still have some of that myself . It 's O.K. to have one old guy around , but not too many . I do n't like to feel I 'm dragging the director around . " <p> " The Ride Down Mount Morgan , " first produced in London five years ago , runs from Wednesday through July 28 on the festival 's mainstage . The London production , directed by Michael Blakemore with Tom Conti in the central role , had left Mr. Miller unsatisfied , he said . It received mixed reviews at the time . <p> " The play is really a kind of nightmare , " Mr. Miller explained . " It ought to flow rapidly and effortlessly from one moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set , which required too much effort to move around . Having gotten the benefit of seeing it done once , I wanted to work on the script , to make it sharper and more pointed . " <p> His protagonist , Lyman , played by Mr. Abraham , has been in a car crash and broken all his limbs . Throughout much of the play , Lyman lies in bed while his wife ( Michael Learned ) bickers with a younger woman ( Patricia Clarkson ) he has married without bothering to get a divorce . <p> As Mr. Elliott watched his actors rehearse , Mr. Abraham suddenly slipped out of the bed and stood behind it . " Lie down ! " he commanded . As if in a trance , the two women leaped onto the bed , reclining side by side . Mr. Abraham 's voice was so forceful that even Ms. Learned 's Boston bull terrier , Paloma , scampered up and snuggled between the two women . <p> Except for Paloma , everything about the scene derived from Mr. Miller 's script , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a master of serious naturalistic dramas like " Death of a Salesman " and " The Crucible . " <p> " This play is similar to an acid trip , " said Mr. Elliott , " and that 's the way I 'm staging it . I 'm turning it into this subconscious exploration of an ego , the ego of a man who wants it all and does n't really worry about how it 's going to affect anybody else . " DON SHEWEY
