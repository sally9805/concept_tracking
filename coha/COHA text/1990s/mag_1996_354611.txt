BRING BACK THE SENSE OF SHAME . RESTORE IT TO A place of honor . Give it the nicest office in the brain . It is not only social conservatives who urge it . By now , almost everyone agrees that shame is socially indispensable  --  the individual 's internal police department . Without a barrier of protective shame , the raw sewage of the country 's id ( pornography , crime , a general violent rottenness and social stupidity ) seeps upward , into the ego and superego . A kind of moral imbecility smells up the public places . Life in America begins to look like a long afternoon of shameless , aberration-of-the-day television talk shows , tacky and moralistic by turn , the sleepwalking rhythms interrupted at precise intervals by bursts of bright commercial adrenaline . <P> Politics  --  as we vaguely remember every four years  --  is the most important of the nation 's public places . There , of course , the tradition of shamelessness goes back almost to the beginning , spanning the period roughly between the Enlightenment and Ricki Lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred and fear of Catholics and immigrants , anchored a lineage that ran through the Ku Klux Klan to Michigan 's Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s , with his anti-Semitic radio broadcasts and sympathetic sermonettes about Hitler and Mussolini . Pat Buchanan wants Americans to recover their sense of shame about things like sex and pornography . But he is worse than oblivious to the political sewage . It is the medium he has chosen to swim in . <P> Sometimes this evil nonsense takes the form of language . Sometimes it is a powerful presence that lives just beneath the surface of articulation . Even when it is subarticulate , everyone recognizes it instantly  --  feels its menace , knows its smell , a radioactive something that registers on the mind 's Geiger counter . The signals are unmistakable  --  the sneer , a semaphore of eyebrows , the " lock-and-load " swagger . <P> Buchanan 's appeal on economic issues is rational , if simplistic . It is his language in other parts of the field that is scurrilous . In waging the culture wars , he introduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horrors ( the slaughter of the Armenians , Stalin 's starvation of the Ukrainian kulaks , the Hitler Holocaust ) have begun with a demonization of others . Buchanan has a genius for techniques that bundle his enemies together and subtly satanize them . His litany of Jewish villain names ( ticking off " Goldman , Sachs ... Greenspan " as if they were the Elders of Zion ) is slyly anti-Semitic ; he uses a tone of barroom xenophobia on " Jose , " his multipurpose Mexican bashee . He says , " Listen , Mr. Hashimoto the Japanese Prime Minister , " as if he meant " Mr. Tojo . " Buchanan is almost as brilliant at populist bullying as George Wallace was in the days when the Alabaman ranted at " pointy-headed intellectuals who ca n't park their bicycles straight . " After reviewing Buchanan 's quotations over the years , even one who loathes political correctness and hate-speech codes is likely to start seeing their usefulness . In any case , if it quacks like a bigot , then it probably should not be a presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
