THE PERUCA HYDROELECTRIC DAM , NORTH OF THE Croatian city of Split , may not yet be doomed . But it is in serious trouble . Though the dam is located outside the areas designated for Croatia 's rebellious Serbs by last year 's peace plan , the Serbs had threatened to blow it up rather than hand it over to their Croatian rivals . <P> They were n't kidding . When Croat forces took the dam on Thursday , after a week-long struggle to regain territories that U.N . troops had failed to clear of Serb forces , the mines had already been detonated . Gushing water threatened to burst the 210-ft. - high ( 65-m ) structure altogether , washing away the homes of 20,000 people downstream . At week 's end Croatian officials were working feverishly to shore it up and drain the reservoir behind it . <P> A tottering dam was n't the only prize . The Croats also got a destroyed bridge , an unusable airport , and a stinging condemnation from the U.N . Nevertheless , the action has given Croats new confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991 a taste of their own medicine . Though another emergency cease-fire was declared Friday , such sentiments betray the more likely future for Croatia . ( See related story on page 86. )
