Home of the greatest snow on earth ( last year 's count : 600 inches ) , Park City , Utah , is a former ghost town that 's back on the map as a four-seasons resort . <p> Despite its emphasis on youth , Park City , Utah , has a soft spot for seniors . Not all athletes who bike up the bluffs or schuss down the slopes are blond , tanned , and named Tiffany or Todd .. A growing number of retirees , lured by the cool climate and promise of great golf , relocate for the warm months and stay to sample the snow . Last year , more than a thousand retirees from Arizona caused the local population to swell  --  permanent residents number only 6,500  --  when they traveled north for the summer . Many opted to stay . <p> To encourage seniors to experience what Parkites call " the greatest snow on earth , " a local ski area offers a special " It 's Never Too Late " program . The name summarizes the city 's philosophy on fitness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic to become a good skier , " explains Jackson Wells , director of senior services at Park City Ski School . " If you 're in reasonably good condition and at least able to walk briskly , you 're ready to start learning the basics . " And he ought to know . A retired real-estate executive , Wells pioneered the program after getting involved in ski school five years ago . His enthusiasm has convinced many latter-day skiers of his belief that " chronological age is no barrier to learning . " <p> Neither is distance . At a time when fax machines and air travel allow executives to live where they want and commute when they must , Park City is becoming a bedroom community for urban areas across the country . Houses sell within hours to newcomers bent on skiing in the winter and hiking , biking , golfing , and ballooning in the off-season . On the surface , the area 's attraction seems to be its contemporary lifestyle , its focus on fitness , and its residents ' passionate concern for the environment . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and developed according to marketing studies to meet the whims of the ' 90s . Parkites revere their town s long and colorful history , and much of the area 's sunny future is based on its shady past . <p> Unlike many Utah towns , Park . City was n't settled by Mormons , and its roots are anything but religious . A booming silver camp whose mines yielded more than $400 million in ore during their heyday , the town earned its fame as an any-thing-goes kind of place where miners could stumble in as paupers and swagger out as millionaires . Local legend tells of-a turn-of-the-century evangelist who was dismayed at the sin he encountered on Main Street ( 27 saloons and a flourishing red-light district ) . As he huffed out of town , he delivered this righteous diatribe : " Salt Lake City is the wickedest city in the United States , and Park City is only 40 rods from hell ! " <p> Even Utah 's Prohibition days failed to douse Parkites ' fondness of a spirits-filled life . One favorite story tells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive his hearse to nearby Evanston , Wyoming , load up on illegal whiskey , pull down the shades , and solemnly head back to his funeral parlor . Local tavern owners would then replenish their supply by visiting Archer 's garage in the dark of night . <p> Life is calmer these days . Newcomers no longer come to make their fortunes and leave ; instead , they bring their fortunes with them to enjoy . This is no bargain destination . Hotels , condos , and bed-and-break-fast inns have replaced old boarding houses , and pubs called the Cozy First and the Last Chance Saloon have given way to restaurants with cutesy names like the Claimjumper , Grubsteak , Pastabilities , and El Cheepo . Many of the area 's 100 shops and boutiques have branches in similar pricey watering holes , such as Aspen , Moab , and Sun Valley . Glitzy nightlife abounds , and almost everyone takes pride in the city 's top ten position on Ski Magazine 's list of favorite apresski spots . <p> Still , the community is friendly , residents know each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , they 're willing to pull together to advance their burgeoning town . When the vintage Miners Hospital was restored as a public library a decade ago , more than 700 Parkites formed a human " book brigade " and transferred hundreds of volumes from the old facility to the new , three quarters of a mile away . <p> More recently , the pitch-in project has been of Olympic proportions . Park City claims a major stake in near by Salt Lake City 's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games . If Utah is selected  --  the decision will be announced in June of ' 95  --  Park City will be the site of the slalom , giant slalom , bobsled , ski jump , and free style events . To boost the effort , a $35 million Winter Sports Park opened last summer at Bear Hollow , just three miles outside of Park City . It features year-round training facilities for the U.S. Ski Team , which has been based in Park City for 20 years . <p> " This is no Sea World , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Athletes train and competeon snow in winter and on jumps coated with plastic in summer . We can emulate conditions that range from slush to hard-packed to icy snow . " Warm-weather skiers in wet suits practice their jumps on ramps that project them 50 feet into the air and deliver them into a splash pool . For a small entrance fee , spectators are invited to watch . <p> If Salt Lake City 's Olympic efforts are successful  --  and the outlook is promising since the area was nosed out for the ' 98 Games by only four votes  --  tiny Park City will enjoy fame by association . The rags-to-riches mining town will be nudged squarely into the spotlight , and TV viewers will witness a never-never land where all residents appear tanned , athletic , and under 30 . Peter Pan would be right at home here . <p> " He was my idol , " jokes Tom Cammermeyer , 44 , a mountain-climbing expert who insists that tourists shed their wristwatches before taking off on a leisurely trek with him . Why no watches ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're tired , and we do n't let a clock dictate our activities . " And why Peter Pan ? " Because he never grew up , " says Cammermeyer with a grin . <p> In timeless Park City , you do n't have to . * * * <p> For more information : Free brochures on Salt Lake City attractions are available by calling 801-521-2858 ; for Park City activities , call 1-800-453-1360 . Park City is located in the heart of Utah 's Wasatch Mountains , 30 miles east of the Salt Lake International Airport via a six-lane interstate ( 1-80 ) . The airport is served by 11 airlines ( Delta offers the most frequent flights ) with more than 500 daily arrivals and departures . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Olympic-bound skiers practice all year at the Utah Winter Sports Park , where the 90-meter jump is covered with a porcelain in-run and has a plastic mat landing .

The limestone landmark a public school from 1889 to 1932 and now an upscale inn  --  is located half a block from the trendy shops of Main Street and a block from the nearest ski lifts . <p> Although the B &B; has earned high praise from A.A.A. and occupies a place on the National Register , its best reviews come from patrons . A guest book by the fireplace gushes endorsements of visitors from Texas , New York , and Georgia , The inn 's ambiance once nudged a Japanese guest to scrawl his approval in vertical columns and then to summarize : " Very nice hotel ? A couple from Memphis reverently scribbled the ultimate compliment : " Just like Graceland . " <p> The schoolhouse theme , understated and never contrived , creates a warm link with the past .

Gone are the coal chutes and sooty basement ; in their places are a hot tub , sauna , and wicker lounge chairs . The wood stoves have been replaced by central heat , the library now offers CNN as well as McGuffey readers , and guestrooms are furnished with oversized Victorian beds with fluffy comforters and extra pillows . <p> And cafeteria food never tasted quite this good . <p> In addition to sumptuous breakfasts of muffins , oven omelets , and potato pancakes with applesauce , healthy snacks are set out on the antique sideboard each afternoon at 3:00 . Typical of the light fare are herbal teas , bowls of fresh fruit , wedges of cheese , and raw veggies served with the schoolhouse 's own dressing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you " but also an offer to jot down the recipe from the kitchen file .
