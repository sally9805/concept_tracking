If all goes according to plan  --  a big " if " when it comes to new technology  --  broadcast history will be made in a meeting room on Capitol Hill this week . A new kind of television signal will leave the Bethesda , Md. , TV tower of WETA , a PBS affiliate , fly across downtown Washington , strike an antenna on the roof of the Capitol building and zip down a cable into the Thomas P. O'Neill Room two floors below . There , before an audience of Senators , Congressmen and assorted commissioners , magician Harry Blackstone Jr . will draw back a black cloth and reveal the first image ever to be broadcast in digital high-definition television : a razor-sharp picture of a fluttering American flag . <P> The image is well chosen . Just two years ago , high-definition television ( HDTV ) was a symbol of everything that was wrong with the American electronics industry . After ceding most of the market for today 's television sets to Japanese and European manufacturers , the U.S. was about to lose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a matter of time before U.S. consumers started replacing their squat , fuzzy receivers with crisp , wide- screen sets built around a made-in-Japan technology called analog HDTV . <P> Now the situation is reversed . With this week 's broadcast , the U.S. will seize the lead in the HDTV race , having successfully changed the venue of the battle : from the world of radio- and TV-signal processing , in which the Japanese excel , to the digital world of computers , which is dominated by U.S. firms . " The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in the U.S. , " says Donald Rumsfeld , former Secretary of Defense and now chairman of General Instrument , the Chicago-based company that spearheaded the push to digital HDTV . <P> This week 's demonstration , staged by General Instrument , marks a victory for those who have argued that the Japanese approach to television design is all wrong , a relic of 19th century technology that dates back to Marconi and Bell . The future , they say , is digital . To survive in a world dominated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television of the future must speak in the streams of 0s and 1s that are the language of computers . <P> Conventional TV uses analog waves as electronic representations  --  or analogues  --  of the light and sound waves captured by television cameras and microphones . The Japanese approach to HDTV was to double the number of horizontal lines used to reproduce the images on the screen  --  from just over 500 to more than 1,000  --  while continuing to rely on analog technology to transmit the images . <P> Scientists have long known that it is possible to represent the information carried in analog waves with strings of numbers . That is essentially what recording engineers did when they replaced analog records and tapes with digital compact discs . The advantages are twofold . Digital signals offer many more opportunities to identify and eliminate distortions caused by interference  --  the echoes , flutters , ghosts and bursts of noise that can make today 's broadcast television so hard on the eyes . Going digital also makes it easier to isolate and manipulate images  --  freeze frames , enlarge pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will grow increasingly important as television and computer technology begin to merge .
