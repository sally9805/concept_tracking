<p> In what surely wo n't be remembered as an April Fools ' joke , America Online announced this week that it will raise its monthly charge by 10 percent on April 1 . AOL , the largest Internet service provider  --  ISP  --  with more than 11 million subscribers , will increase its monthly unlimited-use fee from $ 19.95 to $ 21.95 . <p> Investors loved the news  --  it boosted AOL 's stock by 12 percent Monday , and the stock continued to rise Tuesday and Wednesday  --  because they figure it 's going to increase profits . <p> But it was a surprise for computer users , given the company 's recent strong earnings report : The figures showed revenue growing 45 percent year-over-year , with AOL posting a $ 20.8 million profit . Business has been so good , in fact , that AOL recently announced a 2-for-1 stock split . <p> The timing of the announcement also came only a week after AOL acquired the subscriber rolls of CompuServe Corp. , a company that was AOL 's largest on-line services competitor before AOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising rates , several industry analysts expect a wave of rate increases by other companies that provide Internet access  --  whether the companies provide a bare-bones service or a lot of extras like AOL or Microsoft Network , which both provide information and services available only to subscribers . <p> " Whatever price AOL sets becomes a sort of benchmark " for smaller companies , said Clay Ryder , chief analyst for Zona Research Inc. , a technology-research concern in Redwood City , Calif . <p> AOL 's chief executive officer , Steve Case , says the price increase will fund needed work to counter troubles providing fast and reliable Internet connections for customers . For more than a year , AOL has been the target of lawsuits by customers who have said they can not connect to the Net because there are more people using AOL than the company can handle . <p> But if you are an AOL subscriber who is unhappy about the price increase and connection troubles , what do you gain if you switch to an alternate provider ? Who can you switch to and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price break , at least in the short term . Although most of the national ISPs also provide basic unlimited service for $ 19.95 per month , some offer prepaid discounts , free setups and simplified ways to switch services . <p> Earthlink Network Inc. , for example , has just started a " Get Out of AOL Free " campaign in response to the AOL price increase . <p> " AOL just raised the price of inferior service . We 're sticking to our $ 19.95-per-month pricing , and we 'll continue to welcome new AOL graduates to the Earthlink family , " said Earthlink Chairman Sky Dayton . Earthlink will also waive its setup fees for any new subscribers , including those migrating from AOL . <p> Earthlink even established a Web site ( **25;838;TOOLONG ) and a toll-free number ( 888-QUIT-AOL ) to grab its share of unhappy AOL subscribers . <p> Besides Earthlink , ISP customers can often get a better deal simply by patronizing a smaller company . <p> FlashNet Communications , for example , has offered low cost prepaid monthly Internet access since its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 11.95 per month ) . And Why Telecommunications Inc. of Dallas offers a similar deal for $ 59 per year for weekday-only service . <p> But the future of all-you-can-eat low pricing is not clear , if you believe industry analysts . <p> A price of " $ 19.95 will lead to profitability if you 're well-run , " said Mindspring Enterprises Inc . President Mike McQuary . <p> But Deb Howard , President of 2 Cow Herd , a Venice Beach , Calif. - based ISP , disagreed : " $ 19.95 unlimited service in the current market is unfeasible . Some ISPs have created a lack of awareness in the user base . They have done a disservice to us all . " <p> The bottom-line problem for any ISP and its customers is what it actually costs to service each customer . According to Carl Delabar of Cybermedia Network Gateway ( www.cybermedia.net ) of Vidalia , Ga. , his per-customer expenses run as high as $ 12 per month , with the biggest chunk coming from his telephone charges ( $ 5.50 ) and customer support ( $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.ameritech.net ) confirmed that its per-month customer costs run in the same ballpark , " anywhere from $ 9 to $ 11 , and that includes the discounted chargeback for using our phone service . " <p> Of course , larger ISPs like AOL ought to have economies of scale that would lower their per-customer costs . But the margins still remain slim . <p> " The profit margins are very small , and we ca n't afford to make mistakes , " said another Ameritech manager . <p> Shopping around , though , can lead to bargains . And you can change your ISPs pretty often  --  especially if you can easily forward e-mail from an old account you intend to cancel to your new one , which is a problem for some AOL users since AOL lacks this mail forwarding service . <p> Are there significant service differences among the ISPs ? Of course , but you 'll find that the differences often have more to do with which local dial-up number you use than with the overall services . In fact , just being able to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers who are ISP customers . <p> In addition , if you travel a lot , you will want an ISP that provides local dial-up numbers in the cities you travel to . Otherwise , you 'll have to pay toll charges . AOL , of course , has always provided lots of dial-up numbers across the country . <p> Consolidation in the ISP business is also changing how you decide which ISP to use . AOL first swallowed GNN and now CompuServe . Sprint Communications Co. and Earthlink Network Inc. this week announced that they would be banding together as Earthlink-Sprint to offer a new combined ISP with 600,000 members . <p> " This is such an explosive market . Our pace of growth was n't sufficiently satisfying , " said Tom Weigman , president of consumer services at Sprint . <p> So what do you do , if you 're either unhappy with AOL 's price increase , or just want to find a different ISP ? <p> First all , decide whether you can live without AOL 's content . There are forums and topical areas on AOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AOL 's Web site . If you need these forums and services , then you 'll have to pay the additional $ 2 per month to access AOL through their proprietary software . <p> But what if you do n't ? Then you really do n't need AOL . You 'll get better Web browsing simply by hooking up with the cheapest ISP that offers lots of dial-up numbers in your area ( making sure that it offers modems fast enough to match yours , like the popular 56Kbps units ) . From there you can get to the same World Wide Web you could with AOL , but you 'll use one of the excellent freebie browsers from Microsoft ( Internet Explorer ) or Netscape ( Navigator or Communicator ) for your surfing , e-mailing and user group message browsing . <p> And be prepared to switch ISPs again when prices change , service deteriorates or a new ISP makes you an offer you just ca n't refuse . Right now , Internet service is still in the frontier mining town stage of its development , so it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Sun-Times computer columnist Don Crabb appears on the Connected page Sunday , Tuesday and Thursday and in Homelife on Friday .
