<p> THE plane from LaGuardia was late . Playwright Wendy Wasserstein , who packs a Pulitzer Prize for her hit " The Heidi Chronicles , " is just settling into her hotel room as the interview begins . Suddenly it 's as if a director had yelled , " Action ! " : <p> The phone blares like a submarine " Dive ! " alarm . She tackles the phone , tells the desk to hold all calls because she 's doing an interview . She settles back on the flowered couch , hears the interviewer say " it 's a serious and funny and provocative play ... " when there 's a knock on the door . Room service . The interview starts again , when there 's another knock and the play 's publicist enters , asks " Would you like some seltzer water ? " Ms. Wasserstein passes on the seltzer , laughs in a little-girl voice . She takes a deep breath , gazes around the green-striped room as if she 'd like to re-write this opening scene to be a little less Marx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience for " The Heidi Chronicles " at the Kennedy Center . She listens with a smile , nods her head , says she 's glad they laughed a lot . " Comedically , it 's great to be able to hear when the audience laughs . You fix plays by watching them with an audience . Especially if you 've written a comedy and nobody 's laughing , then it is n't working . " A tiny , ironic laugh . <p> " And I think in terms of movies , you know you sort of shoot all this stuff and then you edit it . It 's also not in the province of the writer . A writer fixes his or her play by sitting there with the director . " <p> Obviously , " The Heidi Chronicles , " which was a smash on Broadway , toured the country , and has just closed in Washington april 27 or 28 is not a work in progress for the theater . But there is " The Heidi Chronicles " : The Movie keep it capped for effect , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film 25 years in the life of Heidi Holland , the distanced , cool , art historian and lecturer , who has lived through women 's liberation , bra-burning , sisterhood , consciousness-raising , the glass ceiling , and the antics of a charming cad named Scoop . By the late ' 80s she 's still championing historic equality for women painters . <p> The woman who wrote " The Heidi Chronicles " does not look even vaguely like a character from her hit play . She fetches a soda with a lilting walk like a dancer 's . ( Early on , she studied at the June Taylor School of the Dance and likes to end scenes with dancing . ) Her long , wildly curly chestnut hair bounces faintly as she walks back to the sofa and plops down . She has brown eyes the color of Hershey 's chocolate , is prettier than her pictures , and merry rather than intellectual . <p> I had been taking notes on what she 's wearing : black jacket , green top , red skirt ablaze with daisies , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings , " she prompts . She splashes the soda into the glass and talks about her other projects . <p> The planned movie version of her comedy " Is n't it Romantic " is in the pipeline as a play for television this summer . " They 're talking about Gwen Verdon playing the dancing mother - she 's just someone I 've always admired . It 's just being put together now , they 're just packaging it " for TV , network unspecified . <p> Wasserstein tells about the new play she 's writing : " The lead is a woman who 's 53 and I hope I can pull it off ... The play is set in London , and the woman falls in love . I thought it would be very interesting for me to write a play in which people end up together . It could make me very happy . " <p> Her perceptions of working in Hollywood and what Hollywood wants are vivid and sometimes scathing : <p> Here she is on the image of women that Hollywood gives : " Boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with superficials . " She mentions a bright , socially concerned niece who loved the movie " Pretty Woman . " " And I kept asking , ' What is it you love about the movie ? ' It suggests , " says Wasserstein , " that ... the ultimate woman should be a hooker , and her boyfriend gives her big jewelry ... I think that 's dangerous stuff ... So much from Hollywood has to do with youth and attractiveness , and being pleasing to men , ( or ) on the other hand , saving a farm ... or lifting a truck " as a Hollywood heroine . <p> She says she 's just finished the screenplay for the movie " The Heidi Chronicles . " It was a hard one to write and has been difficult to get produced intact . " Well , actually it was a movie some filmmakers , some studios did n't want to make , I think because of the episodic nature of it . " <p> The studio criticism came despite the fact that " The Heidi Chronicles " had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other critical acclaim , and had a long run on Broadway , all of which usually has the studios salivating . Wendy Wasserstein explains , " It 's not a ' Diehard 2 , ' it 's not an action movie , and it 's not a romance ... And it 's not your basic classic heroine , either . This is a woman who ends up alone , adopting a Panamanian baby . And that ( adopting a baby ) is not everyone 's favorite thing . So there was Hollywood interest , but it was from people who wanted me to change it substantially . And I did n't want to do that . So I sold it to independent producers whom I like very much , who let me write it as I wanted to write it . " <p> I asked if she were looking for a woman director . " Actually that 's interesting , " she smiles , " because when I went to my agent 's office , and we made lists of directors , what was scary was he gave me this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it , or four women on it . And when we made the list out I said , ' I have to tell you both as a woman playwright and the author of this particular play , that I think ( her laugh has an edge on it ) we should at least consider a woman . " ' She hoots , remembering the exchange . " Yes , he did give me more women 's names . " <p> She has often been asked if she 's Heidi , or like Heidi . She says , " I 'm not much like her ... I 'm more show biz than Heidi , I 'm more superficial than Heidi . I 'm not an academic person like Heidi , but I 've known a lot of Heidis in my time . I 've gone to school with a lot of Heidis at Mount Holyoke . Later on she says , " There are basically Heidis all across America . " <p> Her favorite scene in " The Heidi Chronicles " is the one in which Scoop , the self-adoring love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . They are alone in a room at the reception . He smooches around , explains to Heidi why he did n't marry her , that as women go , she 's an A , " but I do n't want to come home to an A ... " Wasserstein has gotten a lot of flack from guys on Scoop : " I had dinner with a man the other night who was telling me about how ... the character of Scoop was overdrawn , and how could I say that about men ... <p> " I mean , I find ( Scoop ) a charismatic fellow ... And he loves her , in his way . Even after 20 years . It is the heartbreaker : ' I ca n't marry you ... ' It 's so painful , and what do you do in your life , you just move away . But it 's really hard , very sad . Ugh ! " She laughs , " let 's not talk about it . " <p> Wasserstein , who lives in Manhattan , also has a theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a resident playwright . She says , " Knowing you have a home , for a playwright that 's a tremendous thing . " A Yale Drama School graduate , she went on to write for Playwrights Horizons : " Any Woman Ca n't " ; " Montpelier PaZazz " ; " Uncommon Women and Others " ; " Is n't it Romantic " ; " Miami , " a workshop musical ; and " The Heidi Chronicles . " A $50,000 grant from the Fund for New American Plays enabled Horizons to produce " Heidi , " and a 0,000 grant to Wasserstein to rewrite the play made it possible . <p> There 's one constant for her as a writer : " I think you need quiet and I think you need a little time , more than a little time , and it is very hard to find that time and find that distance , ' cause you also have to be part of life and experience it in order to write about . So I think most writers are in many ways observers , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a playwright , you 're listening to people . You 're watching but you 're also even more listening . "
