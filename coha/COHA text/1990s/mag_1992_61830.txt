About three minutes before the tip-off of Sunday 's Tournament of the Americas game , the Cuban players mounted what turned out to be their best attack of the afternoon . They jostled aggressively for position next to Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan , seeking the honor of becoming footnotes to history . Cuba wanted one thing out of its game against the U.S. Olympic team , a.k.a . The Dream Team , a.k.a . The Team You Absolutely Do n't Want to Play Even if One of Its Best Players Is n't in Uniform  --  a Kodak moment . // " Yeah , that was a new one on me , " said Chris Mullin . " Team photo before the center jump . " // This was a new one on Mullin too : With about 12 minutes left in the game and the U.S. ahead by 66 points , U.S. coach Chuck Daly had to do something to stop the rout , so he put in a sorry bench-warming lot : Michael , Magic , Larry Bird , Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 79 , the final score 136-57 . Good thing these international games are only 40 minutes , eh ? // " I kept looking up at the scoreboard , and , yes , it was a logical result , " said Cuban center Felix Morales , who , at 6 ' 6 " , also had to look up at America 's Point Guard , Magic . // Logical , maybe , when your opponent is so strong that its best player , Jordan , scores only six points and later suggests that he is his team 's " defensive specialist . " But was it competition ? Judging from Team America 's frighteningly potent display in its debut , at the Coliseum in Portland , Ore. , the entire U.S. Olympic basketball experience might well have to be assessed as theater , like a star-studded Broadway play . Was Magic up to par in this matinee ? How well did Jordan and Bird feed off each other in the opening act ? Did the supporting cast ( which consists of only one man , Christian Laettner ) measure up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to matter as Team Photo Album compliantly played the role of doormat , and the audience was treated to a show that somehow exceeded everyone 's very excessive expectations . And more of the same can be expected for the remainder of this selection tournament , which will conclude on July 5 with four teams emerging from the 10-team field as qualifiers for Barcelona . After all , Brazil 's Oscar Schmidt , the most famous and talented non-NBA player in the tournament , said following last Saturday 's opening ceremonies , " I want all the American team 's autographs if possible . Larry Bird is my idol . If I could play against him , it would be a great satisfaction . " Not exactly a Beat America battle cry . // But if Team USA sustains its scorched-earth excellence , will we get bored long before the gold medal game in Barcelona on Aug. 8 ? And how well will 79-point routs play at a venue where most of the spectators wo n't be red-white-and-blue ? " I 'm not embarrassed by the team we 're taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That would be like asking Europeans bringing over an all-star soccer team if they were embarrassed . That 's their game . This is our game . " // And make no mistake about it  --  all of Team America brought a Dirty Harry attitude to Portland . Magic awakened at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday , so eager was he to greet the day 's experience . And the bus ride from the hotel to the Coliseum was taken in silence , " like a ride to an NBA Finals game , " said Clyde Drexler . There was no talk of the daily golf outings that had taken place during the prior week at the team 's five-day training camp in La Jolla , Calif . ( David Robinson had earned from Barkley the nickname Long and Wrong , for his prodigious but misguided drives . ) Nor any recounting of the nightly poker games , in which stakes were anything but penny-ante . ( One player had been down $5,000 one evening and had ended up winning $13,000 , so maybe this was n't the game for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , as Team America 's lone rookie , had been the fall guy in La Jolla . ( One evening Barkley had hollered , " Hey , Christian , we ca n't find any cards . Run out to 7-Eleven and get us a deck , will you ? " ) // Earlier in the week Barkley  --  who has emerged , not surprisingly , as the team 's Most Quotable American  --  had said , " Cuba ? That 's where Fidel Castro is from , is n't it ? That 's all I know about Cuba . " And , indeed , Daly 's approach was to get his players in sync rather than to analyze the opposition . But in the locker room before the game , Daly actually ran a few minutes of tape from Cuba 's 79-78 victory over Canada the night before and then went over the Cubans ' starting lineup , and nobody even snickered . " I 'll tell you what I was thinking , " said Karl Ma-lone . " If this was a Utah Jazz playoff game and we lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we lost this game , the whole country would be upset , and they 'd be throwing things . " // And so out they came  --  proud , focused and ready to rumble for Old Glory . Daly started Magic and Jordan in the backcourt , Bird and Barkley at forward and Robinson at center . ( Probable starting center Patrick Ewing , who dislocated his right thumb in La Jolla and was expected to miss at least three games , thus earned the distinction of being the least-missed All-Star in basketball history . ) And almost before you had the chance to marvel at the moment , Magic found Bird cutting down the middle and Bird hit a fallaway jumper . One of Daly 's first decisions had been to name Magic and Bird co-captains , so it was natural that the two legends jump-started The Dream Team . Said Bird , " I just wanted to make the first two points , in case I did n't score the rest of the tournament . " // Sublime moment followed sublime moment . There was Magic racing down-court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and suddenly flipping the ball over his right shoulder to Robinson , the 7 ' 1 " trailer . ( How we 've missed Magic 's expressive face when he steams downcourt on the dribble ! Incidentally , he puts his chances of returning to the Los Angeles Lakers for the 1992-93 NBA season at 50-50 . ) There was the newly goateed Jordan ( " My wife loves it , " he said ) saving a ball on the sidelines near mid-court and wrapping it around his back and to Bird at the baseline , whence Bird buried a jumper . There was Barkley smiling as he took a no-look pass from Magic for an easy layup . There was Drexler back-handing a pass to John Stockton for a breakaway score . There was Malone finding Stockton  --  not vice versa !  --  on a give-and-go . And there was Drexler , again , putting a punctuation mark on the whole thing with a ferocious buzzer-beating slam dunk . Unlike Dan , these guys did n't pass on any height . And , indeed , what can a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Laettner , is a much better player than anyone on the opposition 's roster and when a 30-second clock mandates action ? The U.S. did play some 1-2-2 zone late in the game to ease the defensive pressure , but it was hardly a break for Cuba , which could n't have gotten inside with anything less than a court order . // " I think we owe it to ourselves and the other team to keep playing and not let up , " said Stockton . That was the diplomatic explanation of the rout . // " I do n't know how you can tell players not to play , " said Daly . That was the coach 's explanation of the rout . // " I 'm representing my country , and I sure as hell do n't feel sorry for anybody , " said Malone . " I always wanted to be in the army ; this is the closest I 'll get . " That was the Rambo explanation of the rout . // Funny , but in La Jolla it seemed at least reasonable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition . What about unfamiliar zone defenses , such as the 1-3-1 employed by Cuba ? Well , when your speed , athleticism and skills enable you to run on almost every possession  --  as the U.S. did on Sunday , shooting 72% from the field for the game  --  it does n't make much difference what basic defense your opponent chooses to play . What about guarding players attempting the less challenging international three-point shot ( the line is 20 ' 61/10 " from the basket , as opposed to 23 ' 9 " in the NBA ) , particularly since NBA players are accustomed to dropping back and doubling the post ? Well , when guards like Jordan , Drexler and Stockton are able to discombobulate the opposition into committing 26 turnovers , as they did on Sunday , the nuances of perimeter defense do n't mean much either . And what about that great chemistry question , about the difficulties that Daly might have getting each of these stars to , as he put it , " step down their games just a little bit ? " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overpass rather than to overshoot . On Sunday , The Dream Team had 41 assists on 48 field goals . // It 's unlikely that the U.S. will put forth the kind of effort in the remainder of its qualifying tournament games that it displayed in its history-making debut . But one thing has been obvious from the moment the players gathered in La Jolla on June 21 : They are aware of being a part of something special and will thus continue to seek a special level of performance . With 3:46 left against Cuba and the US. leading by 70 , Drexler walked over to Rod Thorn , the NBA 's vice-president of operations , who had much to do with adding Drexler to the roster . " Thank you , Rod , " Drexler said . " I appreciate it . " // Cuba , strangely , appreciated it too . " For us it was an elegant game , a historic game , " said coach Miguels Calderon Gomez . " We can take back to Cuba a beautiful photograph of us with them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described it as irrelevant . " As we say in Cuba , " he said , " you ca n't cover the sun with your finger . "
