Section : A MATTER OF TASTE From the popularity of McDonald 's hamburgers to the pre-Turkish origins of Near Eastern food , this year 's international food symposium analyzed it all <p> I returned to the courtyard of Saint Antony 's College for the 12th Oxford Food Symposium with the cozy feelings one gets from going back home . This conclave of scholars , cooks , restaurateurs , and just fins becs , gathering under the banner of food history , had long provided me with a sense of community and fellowship , and I was looking forward to the renewal of friendships after a two-year gap . In particular , I was glad to see Alan Davidson , a founder of the symposium , in full regalia after a serious coronary episode . This distinguished gastrotaxonomist of fish was at Saint Antony 's not only to preside over two days of lectures and discussions revolving around the general topic of public eating ; he was also in proud possession of his latest book . <p> Fruit : A Connoisseur 's Guide and Cookbook is in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knox 's stunning paintings standing opposite Davidson 's meticulously precise little essays . The rigor he previously applied to fish he now has lavished on the identification and chronicling of fruits , from the homely apple to the onomatopoeic chupa-chupa . <p> The correct identification of foodstuffs , even relatively common ones , is not at all a simple business , given the immense variety of things we eat and their continuing evolution in the hands of human producers . In Oxford , I myself misidentified the main constituent of a dish at the buffet lunch on the first day of the symposium . <p> As usual , British attendees had each provided what we used to call covered dishes back in the Midwest . Tables were arrayed with homemade examples of far-flung human culinary ingenuity , many of them containing strange ingredients . So I did not sense anything amiss when I took a slice of something labeled in a Spencerian hand as pate de pie . <p> It was delicious , and I did not hesitate to compliment its maker , Alice Wooledge Salmon , on her magpie pate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thrush , yes  --  in 1970 , in a juniper-flavored black pate de grives at Restaurant Troisgros in Roanne , France  --  but never magpie . <p> Salmon seemed not to understand . I repeated myself . At this point , Alicia Rios from Madrid intervened , having overheard us , and asked what a magpie was . Salmon and I described the collecting , hoarding habits of Pica pica , the eponymous thieving magpie of Rossini 's comic opera La Gazza Ladra . Rios nodded and said that in Spanish it was called urraca , but that she had never eaten one . Was there any of the pate left ? <p> Nothing but the label remained . I had misread foie for pie , so it was only a liver pate after all , if a very fine one . <p> I was embarrassed but took comfort when even Davidson found himself at a taxonomic loss that evening , at a dinner with a Scottish theme . He was unable to identify a marine decapod somewhat like a langoustine but not quite . <p> " Not quite " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spring into action . I am certain that Davidson is even now flipping pages in his shellfish sources , and it will not surprise me if he contributes a learned note on the matter , with animadversions on related sublobsters , in Petits Propos Culinaires , the periodical he edits with such flair . <p> It will be a concrete , if unanticipated , result of this symposium 's agenda , since the question of the shellfish 's identity arose as a direct consequence of public dining ( as did my own risible encounter with the " magpie " pate ) . For the most part , however , the symposium unfolded in a series of planned sessions in which papers on public eating were delivered and discussed . <p> This very broad subject takes in both formal dining out , at restaurants and banquets , as well as street food . The proceedings began with a brief history of the restaurant in France by Paul Levy of The Observer , who had in fact discovered the actual location of the first Parisian restaurant , with some of its decor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working sessions and explored a bewildering diversity of special topics . Two papers worked up the evidence on dining out in ancient Greece and Rome . Charles Perry produced texts about food in the souks of ninth-century Baghdad . This was the Middle East before the arrival of the Turks made its food like the food we know today from the region . Perry 's documents show that the principal dishes , judhabah and lauzinaj , do not resemble the shish kebab and baklava we would find today in Baghdad . Instead , judhabah was meat baked in a clay oven ( like the tandoor of India ) and then chopped fine , but the key feature of the dish was the sweet pudding cooked under the meat and used to catch its drippings . Lauzinaj , Perry showed , is the ancestor of Near Eastern shredded wheat pastries , with a filling of almond paste . Given the relative antiquity of the Near Eastern cuisine we know today , this re-creation of truly ancient souk food from before the Turks was a remarkable picture of a buried culture whose influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a palimpsest . <p> Similarly , the food of the Aztecs maintains an occult presence in modern Mexican food . Sophie Coe analyzed accounts of two great banquets of the sixteenth century : one , a feast prepared in 1520 for Montezuma , the Aztec emperor , as he stood on the threshold of catastrophe ; the other , an opulent celebration among the occupying Spanish conquerors . <p> Doreen Fernandez , an emissary from another former Spanish colony , barely managed to get out of Manila , because yet another eruption of Mount Pinatubo closed the airport . She did make it on time , however , and discoursed on the amazingly diverse street food of the Philippines , showing how such oddments as embryo ducks and cheese ice cream fit into the very relaxed and communal life of her country . <p> Judith Kirkendall performed a parallel task for the street food of Hawaii 's multicultural society , introducing most symposiasts for the first time to a concoction known as loco moco , which was " invented in 1949 by the proprietors of the Lincoln Grill in Hilo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of steamed white rice topped by a grilled hamburger patty , then a fried egg is added and the whole covered with a generous dollop of thick meat gravy . " <p> The hamburger is , of course , the public food par excellence and , as such , was discussed in several papers . The worldwide popularity of fast food offered several occasions for genteel xenophobia and even an angry outburst by an American expatriate fed up , as it were , with snide remarks about the cultural imperialism of McDonald 's . <p> The popularity of American hamburger chains around the world is a complicated phenomenon , with different causes in each culture where it happens . In the Soviet Union , the reason seems clear : McDonald 's promised consumers efficient , cheerful , and predictable service . And after reading Robert A. Leonard and Wendy J. Saliba 's paper on " Food , Drink and Swahili Public Space , " it was easy to imagine a triumph for McDonald 's classless , gender-blind system of public dining in the stratified and rule-bound society of Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one eats while walking in the street . Aristocrats never eat in restaurants but do refresh themselves in a guarded way from the elevated entrance porches of their stone houses . An intricate code , deciphered by Leonard and Saliba , controls a spectrum of related nuances . <p> Africans , or people of African descent , played an important if mostly forgotten part in the invention of one of Philadelphia 's traditional dishes , pepper pot . William Woys Weaver gathered in a wealth of evidence to show that the soup we now think of as a relatively mild tripe soup began as a fiery street food brought from the West Indies by blacks . <p> Philadelphia , it turns out , had a significant black population and an important regular commerce with the Caribbean even in colonial days ; and pepper pot , once a diverse and thriving minicuisine built on this early link with West African traditions , is a survival of that time . Weaver also shows that the tripe we now think of as essential to the soup was probably a substitute for the turtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why in eighteenth-century recipes that Weaver cites , the tripe in pepper pot was cooked with spinach to turn it turtle green . <p> Such infiltrations of the apparently sovereign and imperialist Anglo-Saxon master cuisine by lustier foods and dishes from exotic places continue today . The interloping foods have usually been brought to new places by expatriates who grew up eating them . But in Australia , according to the Sydney journalist who calls herself Cherry Ripe after a popular local confection , Asian dishes and ingredients are the rage in mainstream restaurants . Nonwhite Asians have not immigrated to Australia in major numbers , and in any case they are not the main source of this Asian food vogue . " I would contend , " Ripe writes , " that this acceptance of Asian flavors as ' every day ' is due in large part to overseas travel by the peripatetic post-war baby-boom generation .... Such travel exposed Australians to Asian foods other than Chinese , and developed a culinary literacy which was not discarded on the return home . " <p> Before my own return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Antony 's and noticed a large tree laden with fruit , little buff spheres apparently splitting open at the bud end . They were medlars , those ancient European fruits now mostly forgotten because they ca n't be eaten out of hand even when they 're fully ripe . Only after they 've been left to soften , to blet , do they acquire the rich taste and soft texture I once enjoyed long ago from fruit off a tree in Jane Grigson 's Wiltshire garden . Grigson , another symposium friend , is gone now , but with her in mind , I pocketed four of the Saint Antony 's medlars and sneaked them past U. S. customs . They are bletting now in my kitchen , and I aim to plant their seeds . Years from now , perhaps there will be descendants of that Saint Antony 's tree in New York State , bearing fruit that I will eat with friends , a link with last fall 's symposium in substance and in spirit . <p> By Raymond Sokolov <p> <p> Raymond Sokolov is a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alan Davidson 's Marmalade ( Slightly adapted from Fruit : A Connoisseur 's Guide and Cookbook , Simon and Schuster , 1991 ) <p> Mr. Davidson writes : <p> This began life as my grandmother 's recipe , then became that of my parents ( who were both marmalade-makers ) , and has been progressively simplified by me in an effort to minimize the time I have to spend on making 75 pounds annually . Things I have cut out are : steeping the cut fruit overnight ; fiddling around with the pips in a muslin bag ; preheating anything ( sugar , jars , what have you ) ; putting waxed paper discs or melted paraffin wax on top of the marmalade before sealing it . <p> Yet I cling to cutting by hand . <p> Airing my views about marmalade , and in particular the apparent foolishness of incorporating Scotch whisky in it , led to an interesting discovery . A scientist at Cambridge University wrote to point out that , while whisky might interfere with the true flavor of marmalade , anyone who dispenses with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohol ( which could be brandy or vodka ) on top of it before applying the outer seal . This will stop mold from forming at the interface between the marmalade and the small amount of air trapped above it . PREFORMATTED TABLE Wash the oranges and the lemon . Remove the little rosettes at the stem end and clean out any foreign matter . Chop the fruits ( unpeeled ) by hand or machine , but not too finely . Put chopped fruit ( including peel ) in a large pan with water to cover and to spare ( see note ) . Bring to a boil and cook , uncovered , for 20 to 30 minutes or until reduced by a third . Measure the result and return to heat . For every 575 milliliters ( if your measuring cup is n't graduated metrically  --  most glass ones are today  --  then figure that 2 1/3 U. S. cups is the closest practical equivalent ) , add I pound sugar , gradually , stirring until dissolved . Return to boil and continue cooking until a small amount of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy thermometer reads 222 degrees F. Remove from heat immediately and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes . Stir , then ladle into clean jars . Fill them very nearly full . Insure that the top surface is level  --  no chunks of peel sticking up . Float a little alcohol , such as brandy , over the top if you wish . Seal by whatever means you prefer  --  l just use screw-top jars and screw the tops on tight once the marmalade has cooled to just warm . <p> Note : As Davidson points out , the precise quantity of water is not crucial , since the final boiling of the marmalade will reduce the mixture to the correct balance of water and sugar , the sign of this being either a temperature reading of 222 degrees F or the capacity of the mixture to set . <p>
