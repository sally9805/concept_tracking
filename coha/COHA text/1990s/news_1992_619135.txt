<p> BITTERSWEET <p> MEMORIES <p> Editor  --  Carl Nolte 's article ( Chronicle , February 14 ) on the forced removal of the Japanese 50 years ago brought back a bittersweet memory . Even today , it makes me cry . <p> On a wet and dreary Sunday afternoon in early 1942 , our aged and dearly loved Japanese gardener and handyman , Ishii , came to our Oakland home wearing the only suit he owned . My younger brother Peter ( 4 ) and I ( 6 ) had never known our grandfathers . Gentle and patient Ishii had filled that void . He had worked for my father 's family when my father was a boy . As far as we knew , Ishii had no family in the United States . <p> Ishii had come to tell us good-by , that he had to leave for an concentration camp . In his hands was a large , round glass water-filled bowl holding his bright orange goldfish . He asked us to take care of his fish until he returned from the concentration camp at war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening , but we felt the deep sadness of the occasion and the humiliation of our kind friend . We cried . <p> We never saw Ishii again . My parents lost track of him and never learned his fate . I hope his remaining years were happier than his goldfish 's . <p> While I do n't remember the radio broadcasts on Dec. 7 , 1941 , Ishii 's departure signaled the beginning of World War II for Peter and me . <p> DENNIS A. CAVAGNARO <p> Oakland <p> ASIAN-BASHING <p> Editor  --  As an American citizen of Japanese descent , I am concerned about the increasing anti-Asian sentiment in this great country . I can understand how people may be feeling insulted by the recent slurs against American workers made by some Japanese . Yet , is n't this the same rhetoric used by Americans 20 to 30 years ago when materials labeled " Made in Japan " ( or Taiwan , Korea , or Hong Kong for that matter ) implied inferior quality and , therefore , subject to ridicule ? It is possible that the Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of motivation to inspire them to produce quality materials . Perhaps there is hope that America can do the same without getting defensive and resorting to very unproductive " Asian-bashing . " <p> DON WATKINS <p> Stockton <p> WAR , ' NAM AND DEATH <p> Editor  --  So R. C. Alexia ( Letters , February 20 ) spent three tours of duty in ' Nam rather than " live with cowardice at home , " eh ? <p> Well , pal , that 's not the way I heard it . A dear friend of mine , now dead from Agent Orange-induced cancer , told me that his job in ' Nam was to go into villages where peasants were living stone-age style and kill every living thing with napalm and automatic-weapons fire . When he told his company priest that he could not go on killing infants , women and children on a daily basis , my friend was told that these people were not humans , they were the " enemy . " <p> When I was 18 , I understood that the U.S. government 's role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war was corrupt and an imposition on some of the poorest people on the planet . But R. C. Alexis is right about one thing . I lacked , at 18 years of age , the maturity to understand that the war was not caused by authoritarians , those vic tims of chronic testosterone poisoning holding positions of power in the White House , Kremlin and Pentagon . Now , at 40 , I know that the real cause of war is the self-deluding bozos like R. C. Alexia , willing to kill anyone in order to avoid being called a coward and do as they are told by their " superiors . " <p> One day humans will stop taking authoritarians seriously . We will treat the Saddams , the Ho Chi Minhs , Hitlers , Bushes and Nixons as troubled souls in need of psychiatric care . <p> Wake up , Alexia . I 'm no coward . Then , as now , I 'd put a bullet through your head in an instant if I thought I had half a chance of stopping you from killing another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was risking imprisonment or worse by helping military deserters establish new identities here in the U.S. <p> NAME WITHHELD <p> San Francisco <p> HAITIAN REFUGEES <p> Editor  --  Marilyn Geewax 's column , " Why U.S. Should n't Let the Haitians In " ( Chronicle , February 17 ) , is not only cold-hearted , as she admits , but also empty-headed . One of the myths surrounding the debate on refugees is that they all want to come to the U.S. The vast majority of the world 's refugees remain in the poor countries they fled to . <p> Aside from the 15,000 that have left by sea , many Haitians have fled to the Dominican Republic or attempted to reach Cuba or the Bahamas . What Amnesty International and others have been asking for is that the 15,000 not be returned by the U.S. or other countries until things calm down , and that human rights groups be allowed to observe the screening process used to determine who can apply for asylum . The courts agreed with us that the process was flawed , but determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. <p> The forcible return of Haitians to their country under current conditions is a clear violation of international law , of the same principle which the U.S. uses in Southeast Asia to denounce the repatriation of Vietnamese . This double standard and the odor of racism which accompanies our government 's policy toward Haitians is not lost on citizens of other countries . They and we have a right to expect better excuses for wrong- doing from our government  --  and from opinion makers like Geewax . <p> NICHOLAS J. RIZZA <p> Amnesty International , USA <p> San Francisco <p> CAPITAL GAINS AND LIFE <p> Editor  --  It 's not true that a cut in capital gains will benefit only the rich . There must be many people of modest means , like me , who acquired stock slowly and gradually over 30 years or more . Occasionally we sell off a chunk to pay bills , to travel , to make a down payment on a car , or to pay college fees . <p> My way of life is more frugal than that of my parents . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toyota . They lived in a big house ; I rent . They ate steak ; I eat tofu . A cut in the capital gains tax will help me and others who work for a living . <p> MARGARET CRUIKSHANK <p> San Francisco <p> WHO 'S OUT OF TOUCH ? <p> Editor  --  Concerning President Bush and the supermarket scanner , this incident shows once more that the press does not do its homework and its bias has no limits . A local talk show host went as far as making the incredibly stupid remark that even if the report was erroneous , the symbol was there : the president is out of touch with life in the U.S. Some people may be unhappy with President Bush , but there are more substantive areas of disagreement . <p> This unfortunately is not new . The press creates its own world , disconnected from reality and facts . Any serious observer of events is forced often to discount the news manufactured by the press because it does not make any sense . This is particularly true when the press resembles a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even reported or simply silenced . Then you can bet that the truth is the opposite view . <p> It is sad , but there is not much we can do about it . <p> GEORGE NANICHE <p> Moraga <p> A PARK FOR PEOPLE <p> Editor  --  Your editorial ( Chronicle , February 18 ) regarding opening all of Golden Gate Park to automobiles bothers me . Let 's be real  --  the park , deteriorating as I write , is for people , not cars . It 's for the people of the greater San Francisco area to enjoy by walking , bicycling and relaxing . Automobiles do not contribute to any of those activities , particularly in Golden Gate Park . The park has also become a major stop on city bus tours , much like stopping at a fast-food stand on the freeway . This contributes a small parking fee and a large amount of trash from the bus riders who buy junk food from the vendor near the aquarium and the museums . These tourists see nothing of the real treasures of our wonderful park . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . <p> HENRY C. MARKWART <p> Sausalito <p> OPEN THE PARK <p> Editor  --  We thought Golden Gate Park 's museums , the Strybing Arboretum , the Academy of Sciences , the Japanese Tea Garden , etc. , welcomed Bay Area visitors as well as residents and tourists who arrived by bus . We felt less welcome and stopped coming on Sundays when John F. Kennedy Drive was closed and we lost a major parking area . A Saturday closing will mean that those who can come on weekends only will go elsewhere . We thought our admission fees made a welcome contribution to the operating costs of these splendid attractions . Were we wrong ? Has anyone taken a survey to ascertain the areas which produce weekend visitors ? <p> BETTY HOSTETLER <p> Sunnyvale
