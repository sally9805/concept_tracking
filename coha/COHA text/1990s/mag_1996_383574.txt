This is what we always want fall to be , " says the deckhand , breaking for a moment from duties on the OxfordBellevue Ferry . Midstream in passage across Maryland 's Tred Avon River , he gazes out and nods . No doubt about it , fall in its perfect glory has arrived on the Eastern Shore . The chilling air is clear as gin , the sky gleams a brilliant , nearly cloudless blue , and the afternoon sun sparks a dazzling trail across the water , spotlighting shoreline trees turned scarlet , wine red , and yellow . Spread broadly over portions of Delaware , Maryland , and Virginia , the Delmarva Peninsula is n't celebrated for fall colors , but it should be . Its level landscape possesses a careful beauty , one plaited by fields and woodlands , ribboned by creeks and rivers , dotted with ponds and marshes , edged by bays , fronted finally by the Atlantic itself . And come October and November , it offers an annual display every bit as enchanting as any found in mountain country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people still go down to the sea this time of year . To surf-fishermen , fall means bluefish headed south , and these anglers happily cast the day long for the fierce schools that come boiling past the beaches of Cape Henlopen State Park and Assateague Island National Seashore . Photograph Sleek boats anchor almost every waterfront scene across the Eastern Shore . // Just to the north of Indian Inlet at the Delaware Seashore State Park , wet-suited surfers carefully float like seabirds just beyond the breakers . Facing out to sea , they study each approaching swell . When one rises , they paddle furiously , then glide on the curling 10-second express back to the shore , where beachcombers watch and ramble . Crowds have mostly disappeared from Ocean City and Bethany and Rehoboth Beaches , leaving their boardwalks virtually empty . During the third weekend in October , however , about 20,000 visitors return to Rehoboth 's boardwalk , as the cool notes of jazz mingle with the soft air during the annual Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival .

Reservations are a must to secure seating for a din ner performance , but even a stroll around town brings a memorable sampling of the tunes that spill out open doors . By the Bay The Chesapeake Bay defines the ragged shape and the very character of the western reaches of Del marva . The best of the Maryland towns that cling to its coastline reflect a maritime heritage and manicured beauty . Compact and easy , Oxford boasts neat marinas , ships ' stores , and boatyards alongside high-end antiques shops , boutiques , and the likes of the historic Robert Morris Inn . Oxford Mews , a general store on the town 's unassuming main thoroughfare , rents 3-speed bicycles and hands out simple maps to aid exploration of the surrounding countryside . As does Oxford , St. Michaels wears its age proudly and well , but nowhere is that pride more visible than on the grounds of the Chesapeake Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern Shore 's seafaring history , climb the steps to the six-sided Hooper Strait Lighthouse , and watch boatbuilders restore lovely ships by hand . The Small Boat Shed , with its collection of classics , feels like a sailor 's wishbook come to life . Inside , the boxylooking St. Michaels sailing scow sits side-by-side with the long , rakish Sharptown barge , both an old salt 's dream . On Tilghman Island , south of St. Michaels , watermen still dredge for oysters under sail . Between seasons , Capt . Wade Murphy , Jr. , takes passengers aboard his Rebecca T Ruark . After he clears the shallow Dogwood Harbor , he heads the 52foot boat into the wind , and two mates hoist the main sail ; Immediately , the sound of the wind and water slapping the bow blends with the groans of the taut ropes and the treelike wooden mast . As the Rebecca T Ruark tacks across the Choptank River , Murphy tells of his almost 40 years as an oysterman , then joins a demonstration of the grueling work of dredging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once start on the water , you get it in your blood . You 're never going to make a lot of money , but you can make a good living if you work at it . " He flashes a grand smile . " I would n't change jobs with anybody . " The World Between Back roads , which overlay the Eastern Shore like a ragged net , afford the best views of the season . These less-traveled byways pause at crossroad communities where flame-colored maples and bright chrysanthemums give the yards of white cottages an almost New England feel . They bisect rural farms whose sturdy houses stand as islands amid fields gone golden . They skirt wetlands where umbercolored marsh grasses bow before the winds and the cattails line up like sentries . They arc over waterways and dead-end at such picturesque places as Chincoteague , a Virginia fishing village that lies just shy of the Atlantic . Here , the return of migratory waterfowl to the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge signals fall 's certain arrival .

Binoculars in hand , they creep along at a turtle 's pace , transforming their automobiles into mobile bird-watching blinds . Outside their car windows , the amber light of dusk warms the land 's already gilded tones . Thousands of snow geese salt the windworried waters with subtle-toned gadwalls and pintails and brighter feathered northern shovelers . Here and there , pure-white tundra swans , their necks long and graceful , float regally in pairs , while Canada geese beat the water gaily with their dark wings . The birds , just like the visitors who come to admire them , revel in these , the last beautiful days of autumn on the Eastern Shore . // EASTERN SHORE SPECIFICS Photograph The slanting light of dusk gilds sky and fields alike . // <p>
