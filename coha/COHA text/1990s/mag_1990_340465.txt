At the western edge of America , where the continent falls into the Pacific as it follows the sun , the coast has always seemed an image of Eden , a garden of earthly delights . " There is an island called California , on the right hand of the Indies , very near the Earthly Paradise , " wrote a 16th century Spanish fantasist in a novel that gave the Golden State its name . California and other stretches of the Pacific shore would become the fated and fateful destinations of adventurous journeys westward by European settlers , cowboys , miners , Forty- Niners and dreamers . There the travelers would pass , or so they hoped , from their old lives  --  and the Old World  --  into a heaven on earth . As Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in 1879 at the end of a long trip West , " At every turn we could see farther into the land and our own happy futures . . . For this was indeed our destination ; this was the ' good country ' we had been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly inexorable European settlement of the Pacific Coast , there are strangers in the Western paradise . Other peoples too have sought the " good country , " though instead of crossing the continent , they have crossed an ocean ; instead of looking back to Europe , they trace their bloodlines to Asia . The profound impact they have made on the West is a case study of the changes that will sweep the nation as it gradually moves beyond the melting pot . As Asians bring vitality and a renewed sense of purpose to the region , is history repeating itself with a twist ? Just as Europeans took the region from Native Americans , is the West being won all over again by Korean entrepreneurs , Japanese financiers , Indian doctors , Filipino nurses , Vietnamese restaurateurs and Chinese engineers ? <P> What often passes for Asian ghettos bustle with the pride and promise of middle-class America with an exotic cast . Churches hold services in English  --  and Korean , Chinese and Tagalog . The curved eaves of Buddhist temples share suburbia with the flat roofs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disposable diapers to dried sea cucumbers that sell for up to $1,000 per lb . Signs in English and Spanish compete with those in the Korean Hankul alphabet and in Chinese ideograms . When Roman letters appear , they are often tricked out in the rococo accents of Vietnamese . <P> The ties that bind the West Coast to Asia are not merely cultural but also financial . At the news of the earthquake that ravaged the San Francisco Bay area last October , Wall Street barely blinked . But in Tokyo , Manila and Hong Kong , stock markets dipped nervously . The Pacific coastland is a 20th century Asia Minor , a continent in miniature , with a diversity of mores and languages not matched anywhere else . Among those who have sunk roots are Cambodians , Thais , Filipinos , Koreans , Japanese , Indians , Vietnamese , Indochinese hill people , and Chinese from the People 's Republic , Taiwan and Southeast Asia . Most hold on to vibrant links across the Pacific Basin . East may be East and West West , but in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Even as they stake their claims to the American West , Asians are encountering problems : racism , the ambivalence of assimilation , the perils of prosperity , ethnic jealousies and the sometimes dire inequities of a laissez- faire society . Asians in general are still strangers in the Western paradise , and they are keenly aware of their status .
