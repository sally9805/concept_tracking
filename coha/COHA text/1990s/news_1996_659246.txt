<p> Reporters traveling with U.S. troops in Bosnia will be barred from quoting them without permission under Pentagon guidelines tightened after a colonel was quoted as saying Croatians " are racist .

" It sounds like more layers of bureaucracy on what , we think , has been a pretty decent relationship between reporters and troops in the field .

Three years ago , 60 percent said they did . <p> " Television news is in trouble with the American public .

Last June it was 64 percent ; as recently as 1994 it had been 74 percent . <p> By contrast , newspaper readership , after undergoing a similar slump , seems to have stabilized and even edged up . Fifty percent replied yes when asked whether they had read a newspaper " yesterday " ; that compared with the 45 percent who said yes in March 1995 . <p> The poll of news viewing patterns , involving 1,751 respondents , had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points , the Pew Center said . <p> " The other options across the dial have increased explosively , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , said in explanation for the decline of the evening newscasts ' audience .

Ten years later , that figure had fallen to 37 percent . In the 1995-96 season , viewing declined just as dramatically ; only 26 percent of sets were tuned to the evening news , Nielsen said . <p> Among viewers under 30 years of age in the Pew survey , 64 percent said they were too busy to watch network newscasts often .
