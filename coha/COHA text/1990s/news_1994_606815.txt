<p> It 's standard procedure in television for correspondents to be told to keep their opinions off the air . <p> At C-SPAN , Brian Lamb goes a step further . <p> In an internal newsletter , Lamb recently admonished his staff about " keeping our personal views away from hallway conversations , " he says . " It 's part of our ethic . ... Just keep your thoughts to yourself . It 's not a Gestapo atmosphere . No one 's going to be punished or fired . All we said is , watch it . " <p> From its no-jeans rule to a ban on hosts uttering their names on the air , C-SPAN is built on an almost religious devotion to the notion that it is simply a conduit between viewers and public events . And Lamb , the chairman , founder and spiritual leader of the 15-year-old network , personifies this approach . <p> " Brian is a priest of sorts , " a former staffer says . " He does n't drink , does n't smoke , is n't married , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brian had to spend a lot of evangelizing time getting the staff into the idea , " says Brian Lockman , a former C-SPAN vice president . <p> " It sounds a bit cultish , " admits Susan Swain , senior vice president . " People always say , ' How can you be neutral on the air ? ' But I believe so much in the philosophy that I do n't really think about it . " <p> Now , after years of preaching the virtues of unfettered coverage , Lamb is finally winning some converts on Capitol Hill and appears on the verge of a big breakthrough . House Republicans recently agreed to Lamb 's request that C-SPAN be allowed to cover almost all committee hearings , and incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich will open his daily press briefing to cameras as well . ( No word yet from the Senate , or on Lamb 's request to televise bill markups . ) <p> But the jury is out on whether C-SPAN will be allowed to cover the Hill like a real news organization . The main sticking point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras , ending a form of government control that Lamb has long assailed as anti-democratic . <p> " This is the most open country in the world , and if the First Amendment means anything , it 's time for us to show the audience exactly what 's going on , " Lamb says . <p> The decision rests largely in the hands of Gingrich , who mastered the art of exploiting C-SPAN for maximum exposure when he was a mere backbencher . C-SPAN and Gingrich have come of political age together , and the Georgia Republican must decide whether it is in the new majority 's interest to allow viewers to see more of the congressional sausage-making . <p> Other changes will begin next month . The morning call-in shows are being doubled in length to three hours , starting at 7 a.m. , Saturdays and Sundays included ; the evening call-in programs are being dropped . The idea is to give busy viewers a morning briefing on what 's happening in the capital  --  in that distinctive style in which holding up newspaper stories is considered an exciting visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still have the C-SPAN mentality of complete thoughts and not forcing people to speak in sound bites , " says Sarah Trahern , who oversees the call-in shows . " There will be shorter interviews , but we 're not going to tell guests they have 30 seconds to answer a question . " <p> The two C-SPAN channels  --  one devoted to the House ( which is available in 62 million households ) , the other to the Senate ( 35 million )  --  may be giving birth to some offspring . Lamb 's plan for C-SPAN 3 , 4 and 5 would give the network the ability to carry all sorts of live forums and events  --  perhaps including news from around the world  --  when Congress is in session . C-SPAN 3 is expected to be up and running next July . <p> But the new venture comes at a time when C-SPAN , through no fault of its own , is losing viewers . Under a 1992 law designed to guarantee local stations access to cable networks , cable operators serving 3.5 million households have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-SPAN 's video ve'rite ' style continues to exert a powerful attraction . It is the mirror image of flashy , fast-paced TV news : an unedited , slow-moving , gavel-to-gavel world in which there are no celebrity anchors or big-name pundits . And Lamb , 53 , is the biggest non-star , the man the Chicago Tribune called " the anti-Geraldo . " <p> " If you pay someone $ 2 million to be the host of a program , they want people in the audience to know they 're there , " Lamb says . " If you pay me 10 percent of that , which is in fact what I make , it 's not an issue . I like it this way . We 're here to facilitate  --  it 's a horrible word  --  the viewers ' getting the information . " <p> Other network officials sing C-SPAN 's praises . " It 's God 's gift to journalism , " says Tim Russert , NBC 's Washington bureau chief and an admitted junkie . " It has liberated the networks . We used to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive . C-SPAN has allowed us to focus more on reporting . " <p> Even media critics chime in . " C-SPAN empowers people who are already interested and involved , " says Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs . " It 's Joe Friday television  --  just the facts , ma'am  --  at a time when the media have become saturated with opinion . " <p> Some of the recent fare on the policy-wonk network has included : a Democratic Leadership Council meeting , an Agriculture Department news conference on reorganization , a Senate hearing on a national computer database for tracking criminals , a Senate Republican Working Group news conference , a speech by President Clinton called " Pageant of Peace , " a National Press Foundation seminar on viruses  --  and that guaranteed show-stopper , " An Evening With Sen. Richard Lugar and Rep. Lee Hamilton . " On C-SPAN , a National Press Club speech by the Duchess of York  --  known elsewhere as Fergie  --  is as tabloid as it gets . <p> " There are times when it is boring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person may be an absolute lifeline to someone else . If the audience decides it 's boring and wants to turn it off , well , that 's okay . " <p> Efface in the Crowd <p> " We had some wackos this morning , " Brian Lamb says . <p> Lamb is emerging from the Friday morning journalists ' round table he anchors . He is miffed about a fax from an Alabama man , which he read on the air , that " C-SPAN stifles everything except the Republican viewpoint . " Such charges are guaranteed to anger Lamb , who makes a fetish of fairness . <p> " The one way you can get my goat is to say I 'm not being fair . ... Almost everything Bill Clinton says is on this network , " he says . <p> Lamb is funnier and more animated in person than he appears on television , where he seems to flatten out his personality . This is particularly noticeable on " Booknotes , " the hourlong Sunday night show on which the Indiana native interviews authors in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 15 questions Lamb asked Charles Murray , author ( with the late Richard Herrnstein ) of " The Bell Curve , " a controversial book linking race and intelligence : <p> Where does that title come from ? What 's it mean ? Who is Richard Herrnstein ? How did he die ? How long did he live after the diagnosis ? How did you meet him ? What 's the premise here ? What does the word " cognitive " mean ? Can I ask you what IQ means ? When do you get this test ? Should we know our IQs ? Where does that actual number go ? Do you know what your IQ is ? What is a high IQ ? How many people in this country have a 100 IQ ? <p> Lamb enjoys keeping the spotlight on the guest . " Once a host begins to push and argue and banter , he gets in the way , " he says . <p> Still , for a man who disdains personal publicity , Brian Lamb sure gets plenty of it . In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek McGinty 's radio show , and Don Imus has called him a " dork " ( Lamb demanded a definition ) . He and his network have been profiled in Time , the New Yorker , the New York Times Magazine . <p> But Lamb remains sensitive about seeming to seek the spotlight . He will not submit to posed photographs , not since Time took what he calls a " power shot " of him , from the ground up , with the Capitol gleaming in the background . <p> And yet  --  there is no getting around it  --  Brian Lamb is famous . A janitor in a Pittsburgh restroom came up to shake his hand . On a Washington elevator , a courier in helmet and spandex pants said , " Mr. Lamb , I want to thank you for keeping your low profile . " <p> This is a recurring theme among Lamb fans . " I have never been able to figure out if you are a liberal or conservative , " an America Online subscriber said on a C-SPAN message board . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> A self-described " square " who gets up at 4:30 a.m. to watch CNN , Lamb is a news junkie whose idea of a relaxing weekend is tuning in to coverage of the Australian parliament . On this particular morning , he is walking around the network 's North Capitol Street building , checking on the troops . He not only greets each of his 200 employees by name , he knows their kids ' names , their spouses ' names and what college they attended . <p> " This is Molly Chambers . Molly is from Frederick , Maryland , and went to NYU , " he says , introducing a production assistant hired last year . <p> " Brian has that Lafayette , Indiana , charisma , " says political editor Steve Scully . " He 's very down to earth . Nobody calls him Mr. Lamb in this company . " <p> Most C-SPAN employees fairly bubble with excitement about what Lamb calls their " mission . " Many are young , well dressed , well mannered and well scrubbed . <p> " It really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who now runs C-SPAN 's educational services . " We get to do what we have a passion for , but we do n't have to deal with runny noses . " <p> " There 's a real team atmosphere , " says Sarah Trahern . <p> " I just really wanted to work here , " says Debbie Lamb , a community relations rep who happens to be the boss 's niece . " It 's a neat place to work . " <p> Much of the C-SPAN family has grown up together . Susan Swain started as a nighttime programming assistant 12 years ago . Terry Murphy , vice president and executive producer , started as a camera technician 13 years ago . He met and married Kathy Murphy , now senior director of programming operations . <p> Titles can be misleading , for most people at C-SPAN have several jobs , stretching the $ 20 million budget as far as possible . Swain and Scully , for example , double as on-air hosts . And even the lowliest assistant takes a turn riding the C-SPAN bus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communities across America ( and beams back reports from the heartland ) . <p> " Just watching those kids on the bus was incredible , " says spokeswoman Karen Johnson , who spent time on the bus at an Anaheim , Calif. , trade show and is scheduled to ride it next month in Tulsa . <p> Enthusiasm , it seems , is a job requirement . " We did n't want the person running the camera to be someone who wants to work for ABC Sports , " says Lockman , now head of a Pennsylvania cable network . " Otherwise it would kill them to sit through a four-hour hearing . " <p> For some , the new environment is liberating . " I used to fight to get 15 more seconds on a news story , " says Scully , who came from the NBC affiliate in Rochester four years ago . " Now I 'm saying I really need four hours to do this program . ... When I watch the other networks and see the constant babbling going on , I just want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute ! ' " <p> Warming Up <p> When Lamb launched the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network in 1979 , he had to share a satellite with the Madison Square Garden network and sometimes got knocked off the air for a pro wrestling match . <p> There was nowhere to go but up . <p> The Purdue University graduate and Navy veteran had settled in Washington in 1968 , working as a radio reporter and as a press spokesman for the Pentagon and a Republican senator . He later joined the Nixon White House as assistant to the director of the Office of Telecommunications Policy . <p> In 1977 , while working as Cablevision magazine 's Washington bureau chief , Lamb devised a plan for a nonprofit network , funded by the cable industry , that would televise the House . With $ 25,000 in seed money from two cable operators , he launched C-SPAN with four employees working out of a Rosslyn apartment building . They had one phone line , which had to be used for both routine business and call-in shows . <p> But C-SPAN grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates to key committee hearings . President Reagan became a fan . The Senate allowed cameras in 1986 . C-SPAN became a fixture at political conventions and presidential speeches . There were visits to newspaper and magazine offices , simulcasting of radio shows , nightly translations of the Moscow evening news and weekly visits to the British House of Commons . Increasingly , C-SPAN became an alternative for those whose craving for news was n't satisfied by two-minute network reports and eight-second sound bites . <p> As its audience grew , C-SPAN occasionally became a pawn in partisan warfare . In 1984 , as Gingrich and fellow Republicans were regularly scoring televised points by speechifying before a deserted chamber , then-Speaker Tip O'Neill embarrassed the GOP by ordering the camera to pan the empty seats . <p> These days , C-SPAN often gives local politics a national platform . The network carried 104 campaign debates this year , five times as many as in 1990 , including the widely publicized encounter between Sen. Edward Kennedy and GOP challenger Mitt Romney in Massachusetts . After President Clinton announced his middle-class tax cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-SPAN took viewer calls . The network airs 11,000 such calls a year . <p> Presidential contenders are eager to wear wireless mikes for C-SPAN 's " Road to the White House " series , hoping for a little free exposure . " They love it , " Scully says . " Lamar Alexander faxes us his schedule all the time . The Kemp folks are calling us . Pete Wilson 's people are making themselves very available even though he says he 's not running . " <p> Politicians pay attention for a rather basic reason : Ninety-eight percent of C-SPAN 's viewers vote , according to a survey done for the network . And viewers are twice as likely as non-viewers to contact a member of Congress , make a political contribution or volunteer for a campaign . Median household income is $ 40,000 a year , and the partisan split is roughly even : 31 percent are independents , 29 percent Republicans and 28 percent Democrats . C-SPAN has also become a popular venue for the thicket of think tanks , lobbies and universities , some of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some media-savvy groups even maximize their chances by scheduling their events on Mondays and Fridays , which are slow days on the Hill . <p> " We get hundreds of faxes a day about events , " Murphy says . But standards remain strict : " There was a conference in New York on perceptions of women and beauty . It was a great discussion , but there was no public policy component to it . " Murphy nixed it . <p> In a television universe now filled with news and talk channels , Lamb 's challenge is to keep C-SPAN different . What other network , after all , would embrace Lamb 's idea of reenacting the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates , each of which lasted at least three hours ? C-SPAN helped stage the debates in seven Illinois communities , complete with period costumes and specially constructed sites . " A magnificent experience , " Lamb says . <p> In this age of MTV-paced news , viewers might have been clicking off the debates in droves . But Lamb does n't know  --  or care  --  how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If you start taking ratings you 'll get the O.J. story , and this is the O.J.-free zone , " he says proudly . <p> CAPTION : C-SPAN President Brian Lamb on his low-profile public affairs network : We 're here to facilitate  --  it 's a horrible word  --  the viewers ' getting the information . <p> CAPTION : Brian Lamb , who launched C-SPAN 15 years ago out of an apartment building , says his network is " the O.J.-free zone .
