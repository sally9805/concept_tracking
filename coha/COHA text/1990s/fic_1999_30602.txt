New York City One Year Later It was one thing to believe in ghosts , another to actually see them . Sweeney had discovered , though , that the kicker was whether or not she knew the ghost . In the small village of Clayton , New York , where she had lived until almost a year ago , she 'd had at least a nodding acquaintance with most of the inhabitants , including the dead ones . In New York City , she did n't know any of them , so she could look past the translucent faces in the crowd and pretend not to see them . Back in Clayton , after she had seen the ghost of Sam Beresford , she had never known when another ghost would stop and speak , and she had never been sharp enough to play it cool and pretend nothing had happened . No , she 'd just had to react , and before long people were giving her those looks that said they suspected she was losing her marbles . She had packed up and moved before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city was better . Warmer , too . About the time she began seeing the ghosts , her internal heat regulator seemed to go on the fritz , too . She always felt chilled these days , had for the past year . Maybe the cold had started even before she saw little Sam Beresford ; she could n't remember , because who paid attention to things like that ? It was n't exactly something anyone would mark on their calendars : August 29 : Felt cold . Yeah , sure . Sweeney did n't know what had brought the ghosts to mind this bright September morning , but they were the first things she thought of when she woke . That , and the cold , which seemed worse . She got out of bed , hurriedly changed her pajamas for sweats , anr coffee . She did n't like meeting prospective clients , but she did like doing portraits  --  and she needed the work . About the time she had started seeing ghosts , her work had gone to hell in a handbasket . The trademark delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an uncharacteristic boisterousness , and she did n't like it . Her colors had always been transparent , as if they were watercolors instead of oils , but now , no matter how hard she tried , she found herself gravitating toward deep , passionate , unrealistic shades . She had n't carried anything to Candra 's gallery in months , and though her old pieces were still selling , there could n't be many left . She owed it to Candra to take the job , if the couple liked her work . Sweeney was aware that she was not now and probably would never be a hot commodity , because her art was considered too traditional , but nevertheless Candra had always steered her way those customers who preferred the traditional approach , thereby providing Sweeney with a fairly steady , moderately lucrative income . Above that , last year when Sweeney had announced her intention of leaving Clayton , it was Candra who had scouted out this apartment for her . Not that New York City would have been Sweeney 's first choice ; she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was warmer than Clayton , which sat on the St. Lawrence River , just east of Lake Ontario , and every winter was the recipient of lake-effect snows . New York City was coastal ; it snowed during the winter , but not as often and not as much , and the temperatures were more moderate . Not moderate enough ; Sweeney had been thinking more along the lines of Miami , but Candra had talked her into coming to the city and Sweeney did n't regret it . There was always something going on , which provided her with plenty of distraction whenever she thought she was going to scream from frustration . Above all , New York was big enough that she did n't know any of the dead people , did n't feel compelled by good manners to acknowledge them . The city also provided a steady supply of faces  --  live ones . She loved faces , loved studying them , which was why her portrait work was steadily increasing  --  thank God , because otherwise her bank account would have been in serious trouble , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for now , and by New York standards the rent was reasonable . Candra had known about the apartment because her husband , Richard Worth , owned the building . He was some sort of Wall Street whiz , a self-made market millionaire ; Sweeney had met him a couple of times , and tried to stay as far away from him as possible . He had an interesting but intimidating face , and she thought he must be the type of man who steamrollered over everyone in his path . She made it a point not to be in his way . The neighborhood was n't the best , nor was the building , but the apartment was a corner one , with huge windows . She could happily have lived in a barn , if it had as good a light  --  and central heat . The coffee had stopped her shivering . She always felt a little chilled now , but mornings were the worst . She would have gone to a doctor , but whenever she imagined talking to someone about what as going on , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started seeing ghosts , Doctor , and that 's when I got cold . Oh , by the way , traffic signals turn green whenever I approach , too . And my plants bloom out of s eason . So what 's wrong with me ? " Sure . Not in this lifetime . She 'd been pointed at enough when she was a kid . Being an artist was uncommon enough ; she was n't about to let herself be labeled as wacko , too . The past year had been trying for more reasons than just seeing ghosts . Sweeney resisted change with a stubborn determination that was no less unyielding for its lack of ferocity . She was n't ferocious about anything but painting . Still , over the years those who knew her well had learned how tenacious she was . She liked routine , liked her life to have an even tenor . She could get along just fine without drama , despair , and excitement , having had a surfeit of it in her childhood . For her , sameness and normality equaled security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed , when she knew she was no longer normal , even if she had managed to hide it from the rest of the world ? And now she seemed to have lost her direction , if not her talent ; but what good was talent if she did n't know what she was doing with it ? She turned on the television to keep her company while she rustled up breakfast , though cereal did n't require much rustling . She ate the corn flakes dry , without milk , because the milk was cold and she had just gotten rid of the chill , so she was n't eager to reacquire it . As she ate , the sexy Diet Coke commercial came on , and she paused , spoon halfway to her mouth , eyes widening as her lips formed a silent " wow . " By the time the commercial ended , she felt almost sweaty . Maybe watching more television ads was the key to feeling warm . After putting in several hours of work in the studio , Sweeney realized it was almost one o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery . She hated dressing up , but she found herself reaching for a skirt and top instead of her usual jeans and sweatshirt . A flash of scarlet caught her eye , and she slid clothes hangers to the side to extract a red sweater she had never worn that someone had given her for Christmas several years before . The tags were still on it . Studying the bright , rich color , she decided that was just what she wanted today . She supposed she should take some pains with her hair , too . Standing in front of the mirror , she frowned . She had been blessed , or cursed , with very curly , very unruly hair , and she kept it longer than shoulder length because the weight helped hold it down . Her options were limited ; she could pull it back and look like a schoolgirl , try to pin it up and hope she did n't end up with stray curls sticking out like corkscrews , or leave it loose . She opted for loose ; the possibility of humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unruly parts . When she was little , she had hated her hair . She had inherited the wild curls from her mother , only her mother had gloried in having an untamable mane of hair , bringing even more attention to it by coloring it every shade of red imaginable . She had wanted to color Sweeney 's hair , too , but even as a child Sweeney had clung to the small bits of normalcy in her life . Her hair was brown , and she was going to keep it brown . Not red , not black , not platinum . Brown . The color was ordinary , even if the curls were a bit flamboyant . Putting down the comb , she critically surveyed herself . There . Except for the hair , there was nothing about her that would draw attention . Trim , medium height  --  well , almost . She would have liked another i nch or two . Blue eyes , curly brown hair . Good skin . She was thirty-one , and still no wrinkles had appeared . The black skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to walk to the gallery in but did n't look seriously grandmotherly , and the scarlet sweater was ... great . She almost took it off , but was too beguiled by the color . Some makeup seemed called for . She was never certain she knew what she was doing with the stuff , so she limited herself to the most basic : mascara and lipstick . This was her insurance against looking like a clown . Or Mom , her almost-subconscious jibed . Sweeney always made a real effort to avoid looking or acting like her mother . Being an artist was already enough of a family resemblance . Because she was fairly certain that all Candra had left of her paintings at the gallery were a couple of landscapes , she sorted through the stack of sketches she 'd made of people , selecting the ones that were closest to being finished and put them in a portfolio to show to the McMillans . She did n't have any finished portraits to show , because they were all commissioned and went to the subject as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left the apartment for the walk to the gallery . The warm September sun beamed down on her as soon as she stepped onto the sidewalk , and she drew a deep sigh of pleasure at the heat . Most of the people she passed , except for the business types who probably wore suits and ties to bed , were in short sleeves . A sign alternating with the time and temperature announced that the temperature was eighty-four degrees . It was a nice day , the kind of day when walking was a joy . She came to the corner where her fav orite hot dog vendor worked his stand and stopped . The old man had one of the sweetest faces she had ever seen . He was always smiling , his teeth bright and even in his dark-skinned face . Dentures , probably ; people his age seldom had their own teeth . He was sixty-eight , he 'd once told her ; time to retire . Old folks like him needed to get out of the way and let some youngster make a living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had no intention of retiring . He kept selling his hot dogs and smiling his sweet smile at his customers . She had noticed him the first week she 'd been in New York and made it a point to pass by his stand as often as possible so she could study his face . His expression fascinated her . She had sketched it a few times , the work quick and rudimentary because she did n't want him to notice what she was doing and become self-conscious . She had n't quite gotten it right yet , the look of a man who had no quarrel with the world . He simply enjoyed life . It was that , the total lack of cynicism in his eyes , like a child 's , that made her fingers itch to capture him on paper and canvas . " Here ya go , Sweeney . " He swapped the hot dog for the money in her hand , and she tucked the portfolio safely between her calves while she slathered a ton of mustard on the dog . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . She had n't had a date in ... in so long she could n't remember exactly how long it had been . At least a couple of years . Probably several . She had n't missed it . " Business , " she said , and took a bite of the dog . " That 's a shame , lookin ' as hot as you do today . " He winked at her and Sweeney winked back , though she was a bit startled by the compliment . Hot ? Her ? She was the least hot person she knew , in any sense of the word . She would rather work any day , lose herself in color and form , light and texture , than waste time worrying what some man thought about her hair or if he was dating others , too . During college she had gone through the motions because it had seemed to be expected of her , but aside from a couple of rare crushes in high school she had never cared much about any guy . She had n't felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning , come to think of it . She was more than a little surprised at herself , letting the Diet Coke commercial get to her like that . This late-blooming lust took her aback . She had thought herself safe from the insane hormonal urges that wrecked the creative careers of so many women , or at least diluted them . " You 'll knock ' em dead in that outfit , " the vendor said , winking at her again . Funny , she had n't thought the simple skirt and sweater that fetching . It had to be the color , she thought . New Yorkers always wore black ; sometimes she thought no one in the city owned a single bright-colored garment . She must look like a cardinal among crows , decked out in her scarlet sweater . And combing her hair had been a definite plus . Hell , she was even wearing earrings . She retrieved the portfolio from between her legs and continued down the sidewalk , hot dog in hand . The gallery was four more blocks , plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Greeting the McMillans with goo smeared on her face would n't leave a good impression . It had been nice of Candra to set up the meeting . Other gallery owners probably would n't have overly concerned themselves with her . The big bucks were in primitive and modern art , not in the traditional style she preferred , but Candra was always looking out for Sweeney 's interests , guiding business her way . She did that for all the artists whose work she displayed , from the lowest seller to the highest , with a natural warmth that attracted customers , probably making the gallery a ton of money every year . Not that Candra had to worry about money ; Richard 's wealth made the gallery 's profit , or lack of one , unimportant . At the thought of Richard Worth , his face sprang to her mind , accompanied by the usual uneasiness . She would have liked to paint him , but could n't see herself asking . His face was all hard angles and sharp eyes . She would never portray him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits he liked , though ; she would put that face on the docks , or behind the wheel of a big truck . Richard Worth looked like a sweaty T-shirt kinda guy , not a Wall Street wizard . He and Candra seemed like such opposites . Candra was lovely , aristocratic , with her sleek dark hair and chocolate eyes , but it was a bland sort of loveliness , the type possessed by thousands of women : attractive , but not remarkable . Her true charm lay in her friendly personality , which , like the vendor 's sweetness , came from what lay behind the face . Richard 's nature seemed molded in his bones , his tough , angled face a testament to the man . As a couple they seemed mismatched , though their marriage had lasted ten years . The times Sweeney had seen them together , she had gotten the impression that though they were standing side by side , it was merely by chance . Richard seemed too cold , too much a workaholic , to appeal to a woman of Candra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple in their private moments ? Maybe he sometimes actually relaxed . As Sweeney approached a corner , the traffic signal changed and the Walk sign lit . She had become accustomed to the convenience of never having to linger on any corners waiting for the signals to change . A few drivers seemed bewildered by the brevity of the green light , but that was n't her problem . She almost smirked at them as she crossed the street . She hated wasting time , and standing around on a street corner sure qualified as wasted time . She begrudged every moment away from her painting , so much so that even eating almost qualified as wasted time . Not sleeping , though . She loved to sleep . One of her favorite things was to work late into the night , until she was exhausted , then to fall into bed , feeling that delicious heaviness as she lost consciousness , like falling into a hole . The only thing that made it better was if it was raining , too . The pleasure of going to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , sleeping was an adventure , because with sleep came dreams . She had always dreamed in color , but now her dreams were almost painfully vivid , in lush , brilliant Technicolor . She was fascinated by the hues of her dreams , so intense and vibrant . When she woke she tried to reproduce those colors , only to find they did n't fit her work and she could never get them quite right anyway . They were wrong for the delicacy of her technique , for the precise brushwork that was her trademark . She loved the colors , though , and was disappointed on those mornings when her memory failed to dredge up any dreams at all . She finished the hot dog , tossed the paper in the trash can , and ran a f inger around her mouth to remove any leftover mustard . She did n't much like hot dogs , so she had to smother the taste with a lot of mustard . She supposed she could eat something she did like , but , well , the vendor was always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go out of her way , so getting a hot dog saved time . Not only that , now she would n't have to waste time eating once she got home . People marched along the sidewalks , not talking  --  unless it was on their cell phones  --  and seldom making eye contact . Sweeney openly studied their faces , knowing they were n't likely to look at her and thus catch her looking at them . She ignored the occasional face that was too transparent . It was easy ; being New Yorkers , even the ghosts tended to avoid eye contact . The huge variety of faces in the city was a constant source of wonder and inspiration to her . Paris ... well , Paris was okay , but even its name made her uncomfortable . She had seen too many pretentious artists , like her mother , make a big deal about painting in Paris , and Sweeney just did n't fit in with the art crowd there . Not that she fit in with the art crowd here , either , she reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , more a sense of being unseen . Candra 's idea to relocate to the city had been brilliant . Though Sweeney could foresee a day when she would leave , for now she loved it . Someday , the city would pall ; all the places she had lived in had eventually bored her . She had never done any tropical landscapes and figured one day she 'd feel the urge to go to Bora Bora , though on her budget she 'd probably settle for Florida . After all , a palm tree was a palm tree . But for now she was still fascinated with face s , and right here was the best place to be . The gallery was discreetly ensconced behind two double sets of glass doors , the outside set the bulletproof variety , at Richard 's insistence . The lettering on the door was small and plain , announcing " Worth Gallery " and leaving it at that . There was n't a curlicue in sight , which Sweeney appreciated . Ornate gilt lettering would have turned her stomach . As usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Kai , which in Sweeney 's opinion was a sight indeed . He was beautiful ; that was the only word for him . She supposed he filled the function of a receptionist , but she was n't quite certain what his official title was , or if he even had one . Judging from the way some of the female customers stared at him , it was enough for him just to be there ; no other function was required . He had glossy , shoulder-length black hair and narrow dark eyes set above chiseled cheekbones , with lush lips that made her think he must have a Polynesian heritage , and strengthened her urge to paint palm trees . He did some modeling on the side and took art classes at night , which made Kai a very busy boy . She suspected Kai and Candra had had , if not a full-fledged affair , at least a fling . Sweeney could be amazingly oblivious to everything around her when she was working , but painting portraits had made her acutely observant of faces and expressions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between him and Candra . Nothing overt , just a flicker of expression , a brief meeting of gazes , a momentary possessiveness in Kai 's manner . Candra would never wear her heart on her sleeve , but Kai was n't as sophisticated . Sweeney hoped he was n't emotionally involved , because Candra would certainly never allow herself to reciprocate those feelings . Richard 's bucks far outweighed Kai 's beauty . Kai left his seat behind the elegant Queen Anne desk from which he oversaw all entres , coming toward her with a white smile and raised dark eyebrows . " Sweeney . Wow . " His gaze slid down her . " You 're looking hot . " He had a faint accent , a melodious singsong quality that had to be Hawaiian . His expression was openly admiring . A bit concerned , Sweeney glanced down at herself . This made two men who had , within the space of ten minutes , told her she looked " hot . " The simple scarlet sweater must pack more punch than she had realized . From now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , she adored the color . " The McMillans are n't here yet , " Kai said , touching her elbow , his fingertips lingering on the inside of her arm . " Would you like a cup of tea while you wait ? " This was the treatment he gave customers . Her concern edged toward alarm . Whatever mysterious power the color scarlet had , she did n't like all this male attention . Men were trouble , capital T , italicized , underlined . She did n't have time for men , especially not a smooth , twenty-four-year-old high-maintenance boy toy like Kai . She had n't lived seven years longer than he had without learning a few things about herself , namely that she was one of those people who function better alone . The tea sounded good , though . " Earl Grey , one lump of brown . " Candra used the European custom of offering both brown and white lumps of sugar with the tea she kept brewed for her customers . Sweeney considered it an immensely civilized thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kai flashed his brilliant s mile at her again and disappeared into the small alcove where the tea service was kept . Sweeney looked around , wondering where Candra was . If the McMillans were due , then Candra should already be here ; she was extremely punctual , always there to greet the customers with whom she had appointments . Standing where she was , Sweeney could see most of the gallery . It was two stories high , with regal , curving stairs arching like ribbons up both sides of the room , but the space was mostly open and wonderfully lit , which gave her an excellent overall view , and Candra was n't in sight . Kai returned , bearing tea fragrantly steaming in a translucent china cup . " Is Candra here ? " Sweeney asked , taking the cup from him and inhaling the steam with unconscious delight . " She 's in her office , with Richard . " He glanced over his shoulder at the closed door . " I gather the amicable proceedings are n't proceeding very amicably . " Sweeney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What proceedings ? " Kai blinked at her . " The divorce , of course . " " Divorce ? " Sweeney was startled , and disappointed . She had suspected Candra 's marriage was n't perfect , but still , she hated to see people she knew break up . It always distressed her , reminding her of how many divorces she had lived through as a child . " My God , do n't tell me you did n't know . It 's been in the works for almost a year , since right after you moved to the city . I ca n't believe you have n't heard anything about it . " Despite her shock , Sweeney almost snorted . She had lost track of national elections when she was working ; why would a divorce blip on her radar ? She did n't move in Candra 's circles , and though they were friendly acquaintances and had a mutually profitable arrangement  --  usually profitable , that is  --  they were n't exactly bosom buddies . Or maybe Candra did n't think the divorce was important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered why people bothered going through the motions of getting married . Her own parents had each been married four times , twice to each other . Sweeney had one younger brother , after whose birth her mother had decided motherhood distracted her from her devotion to her art and had herself spayed . Her father , though , just kept on begetting with his various wives and had produced two half-brothers and three half-sisters for Sweeney , none of whom she saw more than once every couple of years . There had never been any question of fatherhood being allowed to distract him from his art , which was filmmaking . The last Sweeney had heard , he was about to take wife number five , but that had been at least two years ago , so he might well be on number six by now . Or maybe he had gone back to number four . For all she knew , he might be back with her mother . Sweeney did n't exactly stay in touch . " Candra moved out of the town house just after last Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joy of gossip . " I know it was before Christmas , because she had a Twelve Days of Christmas party in her new apartment on the Upper East Side . It 's totally swank . She called the party her Twelve Days of Freedom . Do n't you remember ? " " I do n't do parties , " she said , as politely as possible . The last party she had attended had been her own eighth birthday party . She had escaped to her room before the ice cream was served , leaving the little hooligans her mother had invited to scream and fight without her . The ice cream had been Neapolitan , anyway , which she hated , but which her mother always served on the theory that this was the easiest way to satisfy all the children 's ice cream preferences . The truth was , Sweeney did n't do well in crowds , period . Socializing was n't her strong point , and she was acutely aware of her shortcomings . She never relaxed , and she was always afraid of doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fond of saying Sweeney had the social grace of a Tibetan goatherd . " You should have done this one . " Kai moved closer to her , his fingertips once again touching the inside of her elbow . " The food was fantastic , the champagne never ran out , and so many people were there you could n't move . It was great . " Kai 's idea of great differed considerably from hers . She was deeply grateful she had n't been invited , though she had to admit that she might have been and promptly forgotten about it . Parties were her idea of hell  --  and speaking of which , what the hell was Kai doing to her elbow ? Scowling , she lifted her arm away from his touch . She knew Kai was a lover-boy , but he 'd never before turned his attentions to her , and she did n't like it . She made a mental note to return the damn sweater to the back of the closet when she got home . " Sorry . " He was astute enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . He smiled down at her . " Like I said , you look hot . It was worth a try . " " Thanks , " she growled . " I 've always wanted to be worth a try . " He laughed , his amusement genuine . " Sure . That 's why your ' Do n't Touch Me ' sign is high , wide , and flashing bright neon . Ah , well , if you 're ever lonely , give me a call . " He shrugged . " So , what ' ve you been up to ? Come to think of it , I do n't think I 've seen you at all for a few months . How 's the work going ? " She shrugged . " I do n't know . I 'm producing , but I 'm not sure what I 'm producing . I 'm trying some techniques . " That was n't the truth , but she was n't about to cry on Kai 's shoulder . He did n't need to know how deeply disturbed she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was helpless to stop it . She tried to do the same delicate , almost ethereal work she had done before , but she seemed to have lost the knack . Those damn vivid colors kept getting in her way , and even though she cursed them , she was losing herself in them . And not only were her colors changing , but it seemed as if her perspective was , too . She did n't know what was going on , but the result was jarring , somehow discordant . She had always been confident about her talent , if nothing else , but now she was so paralyzed by insecurity about her new work that she had n't been able to show it to anyone . " Oh , really . " He looked interested . Of course , he was paid to look interested , so she did n't read a whole lot into his expression . " Do you have anything ready to hang ? I 'd like to see what you 're doing . " " I have several canvases ready to hang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think you have only one piece left on display ; everything else has sold . You need to bring something in . " " I will . " She had to , reluctant though she was . If her new work did n't sell , she did n't eat ; it was that simple . And they could n't sell if she never allowed anyone else to see them . Kai glanced at his watch . " The McMillans should be here soon . I hope Richard leaves before then . Candra does n't like him coming here at all ; she prefers to meet him in the lawyer 's office , so she 'll be furious if he delays her . She 's furious anyway , because he keeps balking . " " He does n't want the divorce ? " Kai gave another graceful shrug . " Who knows what Richard wants ? All I know is , he is n't being very conciliatory . Candra seems to have two moods these days : worried or infuriated . " Infuriated sounded like normal behavior during a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind and wants to back out of the divorce , but does n't know how to smooth things over . " " Oh , she did n't want it at all . " His eyes sparkled with the glee of delivering juicy gossip . " From what I gather , Richard 's the one who filed . Candra 's putting a good face on things , acting as if the decision was mutual , but she is n't at all happy with the split . " Abruptly Sweeney felt ashamed of herself , and irritated , too . Candra had supported her professionally , promoted her , steered clients her way . It went against her grain to gossip like this . If only gossip were n't so titillating . Sweeney tried to control an avid desire to know more , to dig for all the dirty details . The temptation was great . Dirt was like fat ; it made life more delicious . She was saved from herself by the opening of Candra 's office door . She turned and for a brief moment found herself looking directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched with a cattle prod , an unwanted but electric connection . Then Candra appeared , her face pale with fury , gripping his arm and pulling him around as the door slammed shut again , closing out the sight and sound of marital disintegration . " Uh-oh , " Kai said with malicious satisfaction . " There 's gon na be murder . "
