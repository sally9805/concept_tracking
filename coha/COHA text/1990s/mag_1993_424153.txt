WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR RESIDENT EXPERT , YOU CAN MAKE WINDOWS RUN LIKE A CHAMP . <p> No doubt about it . Windows takes the doldrums out of PC computing . We no longer must stare at the boring , unforgiving DOS prompt . It 's easier and more fun to launch and manage applications , and the impact of our work is enhanced by Windows ' ability to display millions of colors and play sound . Even computer games are more exhilarating . However , on its own , Windows is still somewhat cranky and unexciting . If not configured properly , it can be excruciatingly slow . And you ca n't really get the full potential of many Windows applications without additional hardware . <p> Computer users ( especially Windows enthusiasts ) are on a constant quest to get more performance from their machines . To help you , here are ten fairly inexpensive ways to soup up Windows , making it run faster and making the ride more interesting . So , reach beyond the ordinary and give Windows some pizzaz . Improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run applications in a graphical environment , Windows encounters several bottlenecks while running on your computer . Your CPU spends a lot of time waiting for other parts of the computer . Most often , these clogs occur during hard disk accessing and while displaying data on your monitor . The first five ways you can soup up Windows are methods to speed up your system 's performance . Install additional RAM . On a system with only 1MB or 2MB of RAM , a surefire way to speed up Windows is to add more memory to your computer  --  which , nowadays , is quite inexpensive . On most machines you can add memory for well under $50 per megabyte if you shop around . While most software for Windows requires only 1MB-2MB RAM to run , many programs benefit greatly from having an additional 2MB-4MB to stretch out in . More of the program code can load into memory , resulting in less disk accessing . When you 're working on large documents or graphics , it 's faster if all of the file is in RAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance of SmartDrive ( the disk cache bundled with Windows ) or to install a RAM drive . Optimize SmartDrive . Before Windows 3.1 , computer pundits almost unanimously recommended replacing SmartDrive with a third-party product . However , the latest version , 4.0 , is as fast and proficient as most of the others . What SmartDrive does is to reserve a portion of system RAM as a temporary storage bank . When you execute a command from the hard disk , depending on the size of the cache , SmartDrive scoops up and loads not only the code needed to execute the command but also blocks of code on either side of the command . The theory is that the computer will probably soon be called on to use the surrounding code as well . And you 'd be surprised how often the theory proves true . So , up to a certain point , the larger the cache , the less often your system has to call to the hard disk  --  your computer 's slowest component  --  for information , thus causing your system to run faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed to load from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file , one of the files DOS reads while the computer boots . SmartDrive configures itself according to available system memory . It also has the ability to make itself smaller when Windows is running , to provide more memory for your Windows applications . The default settings are shown below . <p> If you add more RAM to your system or you do n't run a lot of programs simultaneously , you can cut down how much you access your hard disk by hard disk by changing the size of your cache . Do so by editing AUTOEXEC.BAT in a text editor or in Windows ' SysEdit . To set the cache to 1MB while using either DOS or Windows , for example , the SmartDrive entry should read C : /WINDOWS/SMARTDRV.EXE/e 1024 1024 . In this example , SmartDrive loads into extended memory ( /e ) and is 1MB in size while in DOS and while in Windows . Keep in mind , though , that a cache bigger than 2MB does little good and in some cases can slow down your computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SmartDrive 's performance . To get a list of them , type smartdrv / ? at the DOS prompt . There is additional information on SmartDrive in chapter 14 of your Microsoft Windows User 's Guide . <p> 3 . Install a RAM drive . If your computer has more than 4MB RAM , you can further reduce disk accessing by using part of the memory as a RAM drive . A RAM drive is a portion of system memory that DOS sets aside and treats as an additional fixed disk . Windows and many Windows applications create temporary files on your hard disk as you work . You can tell DOS to save temporary files to the RAM drive , which allows Windows to save and access the temporary files faster . <p> Use RAMDRIVE.SYS , which should be located in either your Windows or DOS subdirectory ( or both ) , to create a RAM drive . Using a text editor or Windows ' SysEdit , include the following line in the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory on your hard disk : DEVICE=C : /WINDOWS/RAMDRIVE.SY S 2048 /e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory ( use /a for expanded memory ) . The RAM drive is given the letter of the next drive on your system . If , for example , you have just one hard drive , drive C , the RAM drive will be drive D. <p> Now you need to tell DOS to use the RAM drive for temporary files . Do so by adding the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file : SET TEMP=D : ( or your RAM drive letter , if different ) . Note that if there is already a SET TEMP= statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT , you need to be sure to delete it . <p> 4 . Install a graphics accelerator . Windows ' graphics environment is both pretty and easy to work with , but it demands a lot of your computer to display all those windows , scroll bars , and icons on your monitor . If you spend too much time waiting for screen redraws , you can really supercharge Windows by adding a graphics accelerator , such as Diamond Computer Systems ' SpeedStar 24X . Depending on your needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars  --  with the price usually determined by how many colors are available at which resolutions and the amount of RAM on the boards . <p> Graphics accelerators speed up your system by taking the actual processing of the graphics data ( which , when displaying 16.7 million colors at 1024 Yen 780 resolution , is substantial ) from the CPU . This allows your computer 's processor to work on other tasks , such as calculating a spreadsheet or doing a mail merge . <p> 5 . Install a data compression utility . If Windows and its applications are nothing else , they are disk hogs . Depending on your system and how you configure Windows , the environment itself can eat up the better part of 10MB . And many Windows applications require at least 5MB , with several using upward of 20MB . With appetities like that , it does n't take many programs to devour a 40MB or 60MB fixed disk . Until recently , your only recourse was buying a new hard disk . But now , thanks to data compression utilities such as Stac Electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addstor 's SuperStor Pro you can inexpensively double the storage capacity of your hard disk . <p> Data compression software works slightly differently from product to product . Some programs , such as Stacker , create a separate partition for compressed files ; others , such as XtraDrive , do not . For slower machines , such as 80286s and slow 80386s , some companies also make compression boards that work with the software to speed up compression . However , if you use a fast 80386 or 80486 , data compression software is sufficient . In most cases , you 'll hardly notice the difference between the time it takes for these products to compress and decompress files and the time required for normal operation . And sometimes , such as in loading and decompressing executable program files , the process is actually faster than loading an uncompressed file from the hard disk . <p> Especially impressive is Stacker 3.0 for Windows and DOS , which allows you to control data compression from inside Windows . The Stackometer gives you up-to-the-second data on compression ratios and disk performance , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give Windows a New Face <p> While Windows ' Program Manager , File Manager , and outline fonts offer definite advantages over computing in a DOS-only environment , they are by no means perfect . Depending on how you work , there are many options for making Windows ( and your documents ) better looking and more efficient . Try one or more of the next three options to make launching programs and loading documents easier , to automate tasks , and to improve on the standard-fare fonts ( Times and Helvetica equivalents ) that ship with Windows . <p> 6 . Install a new front end . The Windows application market is loaded with products that replace or enhance Program Manager . Some features that most of them have in common include the ability to launch a group of applications in various application window sizes and positions for performing specific tasks , memory and system resources management , macros , drag-and-drop printing and file loading , a way to change keyboard configurations , and even the option to select functions to assign to the right mouse button . Between shareware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 of these utilities , and they vary in features and functionality . Five of the most popular are Hewlett-Packard 's Dashboard and New Wave , hDC Computer 's hDC Power Launcher , Symantec 's Norton Desktop for Windows , and XSoft 's Rooms : <p> All but New Wave let you decide whether to replace Program Manager or run the utility over it . For example , Dashboard ( above ) creates a strip that looks like a car dashboard , complete with instrument gauges , that you can place anywhere on your monitor . You can assign often-used programs to the dash for one-click access , and you can create layouts consisting of several applications  --  such as , say , graphics , DTP , and word processor  --  for a desktop publishing task . Memory and system resources permitting , you can have up to nine layouts open at one time . And there are , of course , many other features , such as a fuel gauge that constantly displays available memory , one-click printer configuration , and an alarm clock . Dashboard ( and Power Launcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other windows , even when inactive , so that Windows ' shell functions are always just a mouse click away . <p> Power Launcher offers many of the features of Dashboard and several others as well . You can , for example , reconfigure your keyboard and mouse and even create a separate set of tools for each of your programs . The program even helps take some of the confusion out of Windows ' powerful OLE ( Object Linking and Embedding ) and DDE ( Dynamic Data Exchange ) . <p> Rooms uses an office-building metaphor , allowing you to separate tasks into virtual desktops called rooms and suites . Norton Desktop is a group of utilities ( such as a file viewer , an automatic backup utility , a scheduler , a data recovery utility , and an icon editor ) that you can run from the Norton Desktop shell or from a Norton program group in Program Manager . New Wave , which requires a substantial commitment to install and use , actually changes the way Windows operates by giving your desktop a Macintosh-like feel  --  tasks separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 7 . Install a macro utility . One thing Windows sorely lacks is a good macro language . Macros , of course , are small programs containing recorded keystrokes and programming commands that allow you to automate tasks , along the same lines as macros in your word processor . There are enormous benefits to a universal macro language that works across all Windows applications . You can use them to merge data from one program to another , program timed events ( such as data transfers in the middle of the night when long-distance rates are lower ) , and perform countless other tasks . Recorder , the utility currently shipping with Windows , is hardly adequate ( hardly worth mentioning , for that matter ) . Microsoft plans to include a macro language in future Windows releases , but for now we must rely on third-party utilities . Luckily , most of the ones available are quite good . <p> Some of the shell utilities , such as Norton Desktop , Power Launcher , and New Wave , include macro languages , and they even allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient and the easiest to use . Two good stand-alone macro products are Publishing Technologies ' BatchWorks and AutoSoft 's AutoRun . While they have slightly different interfaces , the idea behind them is the same : recording and playing back actions in Windows . <p> 8 . Install TrueType fonts . A truly notable addition to Windows 3.1 is the built-in TrueType font rasterizer . ( Version 3.0 users should install Type 1 fonts . ) TrueType fonts are easy to install and manage , and they print and display faster than fonts used in earlier versions of Windows . However , the program is shipped with only a few TrueType typefaces : Courier , Ariel , and Times New Roman . You can improve the appearance of your drawings , presentations , and documents by installing additional fonts . <p> TrueType font packages abound . When looking for one , consider collections that contain a variety of strictly business serif and sans-serif fonts , such as Bodini and Universe , as well as a few decorative fonts , such as Cooper Black or Old English . Decorative fonts work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Not all TrueType fonts are created equal . Since the release of Windows 3.1 , the market has been deluged with TrueType font collections . For best screen and printer reproduction , choose font collections from reputable type foundries , such as Bitstream and Agfa . Two good collections are AgfaType Desktop Styles and Microsoft 's TrueType Font Pack for Windows . <p> If you 're reluctant to switch to TrueType because you already have an extensive Type 1 collection , consider a font conversion utility , such as FontMonger from Ares or AllType from Atech . These programs handily convert Type 1 , Type 3 , and other formats to TrueType outlines , as well as vice versa  --  TrueType to other formats . FontMonger also lets you create your own font sets from EPS drawings , and you can even alter existing fonts to create your own unique collections . Or you can create a font made up of logos and symbols you use often . Listen to Windows <p> The final two ways you can optimize Windows boost its multimedia capabilities . Perhaps frilly accessories to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity . <p> 9 . Add a sound board . To take full advantage of Windows ' multimedia capabilities , you should install a sound board . Once a niche market , PC sound is catching on like wildfire . Leading software vendors , such as Microsoft and Lotus , have released multimedia versions of some of their more popular products . Word for Windows &; Bookshelf , for example , integrates WinWord with Microsoft 's multimedia reference library , Bookshelf . Bookshelf 's encyclopedia contains numerous narrated animations that demonstrate processes such as solar eclipses , continental drift , and others . Not only does the dictionary provide a word 's spelling and definition , but it also pronounces it for you . The multimedia version of Lotus 1-2-3 has a complete automated help system that provides narrated examples of spreadsheet procedures . And a number of inexpensive presentation software packages  --  Asymetrix 's MediaBlitz and Macromedia 's Action ! , to name two  --  allow you to create your own multimedia shows . <p> When buying a sound board , make sure that it meets Microsoft 's MPC standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that it 's a 16-bit card . It should also have jacks for CD-ROM output and a microphone . Creative Labs ' Sound Blaster Pro is one of the most popular and least expensive ; however , Computer Peripherals ' Viva Maestro Pro 16 and Media Vision 's Pro AudioSpectrum 16 are also quite good . <p> If you want to talk back to your computer , look for Computer Peripherals ' Viva Maestro Pro 16VR voice recognition system , which should be released before you read this . This board comes complete with a headset and allows you to control your computer with voice commands such as " open , " " cut , " " paste , " and so on . According to Computer Peripherals , you can train it to execute any commands your applications normally perform . <p> To hear the sound produced by your sound card , you 'll also need speakers . Labtec makes several good pairs , ranging from $20 to $100 . When buying speakers for your PC , make sure that they 're shielded so that their magnets wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't crank out a lot of wattage , your new speakers should also be self-amplified . <p> 10 . Add a microphone . Perhaps one of the least expensive ways to have fun with Windows  --  and enhance your multimedia prowess  --  is to install a microphone . Unlike almost everything else on your computer , this is the one peripheral that does n't require its own card and software . The jack is built into your sound card , and Windows ' Sound Recorder utility is waiting , ready to capture your voice and whatever else you want to record . <p> Installing a microphone is almost too easy . You can get one at the neighborhood Radio Shack or other electronics stores for a little over $10 . If you plan to do high-end multimedia presentations , you 'll want a better microphone , but for most home and small business uses , the inexpensive ones are fine . I use an $11 Realistic microphone with my system . There are , of course , hundreds of other ways to soup up Windows , and the technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day when my computer will load and unload the dishwasher and feed my fish . <p> DEFAULT SETTINGS TABLE <p> <p> Where to Buy <p> Call the manufacturers listed for the latest pricing information . Many have great deals on upgrades and bundled packages . TABLE <p> PHOTO : Dashboard screen <p> PHOTO : To assign sounds to Windows events , select Sound in the Windows Control Panel . <p> PHOTO : With a microphone , making recordings in Windows is as easy as clicking an icon . <p> By WILLIAM HARREL <p> ADDING SOUND TO WINDOWS EVENTS <p> Are you tired of Windows beeping at you every time you turn around ? After installing your sound card , use this procedure to assign sound clips to Windows ' events . <p> Certain events in Windows  --  Exclamation , Question , Top , and others  --  have beeps assigned to them . For example , when you 're installing some applications , Windows displays a dialog box and beeps at you each time the setup program calls for another floppy disk . Once you 've installed a sound card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows events from Control Panel by using these steps . First , from Program Manager , double-click on the Control Panel icon . Next , in ControlPanel , double-click onSound . Finally , select the Enable Sound System check box . <p> Windows is shipped with several WAV sound clips . When you open the Sound dialog box , all the WAV files in your Windows directory are listed in the Files list box . To assign a file to a specific event , select it in the Events list ; then select the sound you want assigned to it in the Files list . You can hear the sound by clicking on the Test button . When you close the dialog box , the sound system is activated . <p> You can copy and delete WAV files from the Windows directory at will , and you can assign an event to any sound you want . For example , when I make a mistake that causes a Critical Stop , a voice admonishes me with an indignant " Wrong ! " You can have a lot of fun with sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microphone . <p> WHY TRUETYPE PRINTS FASTER THAN ATM <p> Does TrueType print faster than the leading Type 1 font rasterizer , Adobe Type Manager ( ATM ) ? The answer is yes , but not always noticeably so . When using TrueType fonts , Windows enhances printing speed by reducing the amount of data that 's downloaded to the printer . <p> On LaserJets and compatible printers , TrueType speeds performance by streamlining the font information downloaded during printing . <p> Instead of sending an entire page in the form of a huge bitmap as with ATM , Windows sends only the characters needed to print the document when using TrueType . New characters are not sent until they 're encountered in the document . Unused characters are not sent at all . Since individual characters are downloaded rather than entire font files , no time is wasted sending and processing unnecessary data . <p> On PostScript printers , imageseters , and slide recorders , the same process ( downloading only necessary characters ) is used , as well as yet another optimizing technique . Smaller point sizes ( 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bitmaps , rather than as outlines . The bitmap files ( Type 3 fonts ) are smaller and therefore do n't take as long to download . <p> When you 're printing short documents , such as letters and memos , the speed gained from this process is hardly noticeable . But TrueType can really speed printing of long documents or those that contain a lot of different fonts at various point sizes . The longer your document , the more time you save . <p>
