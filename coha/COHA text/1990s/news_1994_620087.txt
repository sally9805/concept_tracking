<p> The local boxer is the king of the not-quite-famous , the wanna- be famous . He exists on the periphery , on a distant point of the circle of sport . He fights in airport hotels , longshoremen 's halls , county fair buildings . He looks as if he has seen things and lived things the rest of us ca n't imagine . <p> The local boxer looks for his break , his opening out of the smoky , dank shadows . If he 's good , the local boxer attracts attention , a small following that builds gradually . He runs and trains and sweats , propelled by one goal : world champion . It 's a story nearly as old as the concept of the sport . <p> Eddie Croft exists somewhere in between boxing worlds , in a restless purgatory that allows him to see both sides . He 's closer to the top , to breaking out of the local and into the national and international . Closer to getting some real recognition , and some real change in his pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , but he is different . His face tells no stories . The nose is straight , the eyes alert , the face unmarked . The first thing you notice is that Eddie Croft does n't need this . <p> He is not escaping anything , and this is not a last-chance , dead- end kid . He is not like so many others , who take their fists directly from the street to the ring just because there 's not much else . <p> " I was never in that position where I was boxing to get out of a bad situation , " he said . <p> He does it because he 's good at it , no other reason . He is the 10th-ranked super-bantamweight ( 122 pounds ) with a record of 20-1-1 . He was supposed to be training right now for his breakout fight , the one that would put an end to the scramble for opponents and decent purses . People would be coming to him after this one . <p> Croft , 25 years old , from San Mateo , was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title . It was going to be his biggest payday , almost triple his previous best of $ 7,000 . This fight would mean something , and it would lead somewhere . <p> But Tracy Patterson lost to Hector Acero last month . Patterson was supposed to win ; Croft was counting on it . Now , his match with Patterson gone , Croft 's pursuit continues , destination unknown . <p> * <p> Roger Craig knows some guys ca n't take retirement . Some guys wander through life after their careers end , searching for that comparable high . They never find it , because it 's an unrealistic search . There 's nothing out there  --  nothing legal , anyway  --  that can stand toe-to-toe with the exhilaration and ego-boost of professional sports . <p> Craig  --  former 49er , Raider and Viking  --  played football like someone who would have trouble with retirement . His style was intense , wide-open , the concentration in every pore . <p> " When I decided to retire , I knew I had to do something or go crazy , " Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Craig and Croft meet . Craig trains Croft , making the boxer stronger and more durable . Croft trains Craig , imparting upon the retiree the knowledge that comes with being a second-degree black belt in tae kwon do . <p> This is essentially a relationship rooted in intensity , in taking things a bit more seriously than most people might expect . <p> Craig is highly serious about tae kwon do , working at it as much as six hours a day at the school Croft owns in Foster City . He wants to use it for entertainment purposes , to further his acting career . <p> " This is perfect for me , " Craig said . " It 's the perfect transition . " <p> Craig and Croft also train with weights every day and run up a fire trail in the hills behind San Carlos , a masochistic pursuit that Craig has elevated to the point of myth . It 's four miles , three of it straight up . Craig considers it an athletic Rohrsach test , something to provide a psychological baseline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Craig said . " The first time , Eddie did n't stop . My first time , I stopped three times . Eddie did n't , though , and I knew right away what he was all about . " <p> Croft 's manager , Sal Colucci , and his gym trainer , Johnny Nava , enlisted Craig 's help for the Patterson fight . They perceived strength to be the only flaw in Croft 's game , and few people know strength training like Craig . <p> Now the Patterson fight is off , and no matter how far afield the conversation strays , Croft inevitably brings it back to Acero 's win over Patterson . <p> " Everything was going great , " Croft said . " Then Patterson lost . . . " <p> " He did n't want you , " Craig interrupted . " He did n't want to fight you . He heard you were training hard , lifting . . . " <p> " I 'm still a little down about that , though , " Croft said . <p> Croft 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned by defeating Sacramento 's Richard Duran in his last fight . The Patterson fight would have brought in $ 20,000 , with the promise of exponential jumps should he win . <p> " That 's the thing , you know  --  that 's why I 'm bummed , " Croft said . " It 's like $ 20,000 just rolled out of my pocket . People say , ' Oh , that 's not a lot of money , ' but that is a lot of money . That 's a lot of money for me . And there were other things ; we had an endorsement deal lined up , and that 's gone . If I think about it , I get down . " <p> Croft , a graduate of Aragon High School , came to boxing late , and accidentally . He was practicing his martial arts one day , in a class that included Colucci 's son . Longtime fight promoter Gil Clancy was there , visiting the Coluccis . Clancy looked at Croft and said the kid , then 18 , might make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Croft family , but fate apparently does n't take sides . <p> " My dad always hoped I 'd go to college , be a scholar , " Croft said . " Sometimes I feel bad , that I 've let him down in that aspect . But my father 's always been supportive of what I wanted to do . My mom , she never really believed . I told her from the time I was young : ' I 'm going to grow up and be a world-famous fighter . ' I did n't know what I was going to do . I was thinking maybe I 'd go into kick boxing or karate . Boxing was n't part of it at the time . " <p> Despite the omnipresent entourages that follow the famous  --  corner men , managers , promoters , trainers , general hangers-on  --  boxing is a solitary pursuit . To get up in the morning and run the hills or lift the weights is nobody 's choice but the man himself . And although there are quick glimpses of recognition  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to ingrain the name into the psyche of the average Bay Area sports fan . <p> " It goes in phases , " Croft said . " When I first started , my first five or six fights , I was a real hot thing . And it kind of tapered off . Then in my 15th to 18th fights , I was real hot again . I was taking over as the hottest thing in the Bay Area since Pat Lawlor 's popularity died off . Then I lost a fight , and there it went . " <p> For a guy who has something else  --  a wife , a son , a martial-arts school  --  you wonder how long he 'll stick with it , how many near- misses he 'll sit through before giving it up . He already admits he would n't have stuck with boxing if success had n't come quickly . <p> " Some guys do n't know anything else , they 've never learned anything else , they 've never seen anything else , so they end up fighting well beyond their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Croft said . " I want to fight as long as I can stay competitive with the best . I 'll fight as long as I can compete and win most of the time . " <p> " You 're not talking to a dumb fighter , " Craig said . " This guy 's got intelligence . There 's a lot of dumb fighters out there . Dumb . This is an intelligent guy here , man . " <p> " You ca n't walk off after you lose one , though , " Croft said . " If you lose and fall apart , then you were n't anything to begin with . " <p> It is not a savory sport ; the term " sweet science " seems to have been lost at some point between Gene Tunney and Larry Holmes The First . The stakes are high , the details sometimes unsavory ; after one of Croft 's early fights , it was revealed that his opponent had tested HIV positive and was banned from fighting in Nevada . <p> " The sport is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The object is to detach the opponent from his senses . That 's the object . People saying , ' Boxing is so violent ; it should be banned . ' " <p> " It goes back to the Roman days , " Craig said . " It 's just modern gladiators . Back then they killed . " <p> " The NFL would n't be as popular if it was flag football , " Croft said . <p> " They want to see the hits ; they want to see blood . " <p> " There 's hypocrisy there . People say boxing 's too violent , and then they go and watch football . I think football 's just as violent . " <p> " Yeah , big time , " Craig said . " There 's no doubt . " <p> " Roger told me one time he was playing for the Raiders against Denver , and he got hit and got a cut on his eye . Those guys were like vultures , standing over him saying , ' We got him . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Craig said . " That 's what happened . " <p> Croft is not a big puncher . He is not a violent fighter . He calls himself a technician . The sweet science , maybe . This does not always endear himself to opponents ; nor does it impress those who compile the rankings . They might say he lacks a punch , or does n't relish the macho aspect of the sport . <p> " He 's the closest guy I 've seen that mirrors Sugar Ray Leonard in articulation and good looks , " said Sal Colucci , Croft 's manager . " He 's that style of kid . Some people do n't like him because of it . He makes things look too easy , a yuppie-type fighter . " <p> Craig comes in right about there , along with his hills and his weights and his intensity . The strength has increased ; now they await chance to show the world . <p> " I 'm going to stay with Eddie , " Craig said . " We were training for Tracy Patterson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop training . He was doing too well , so I decided to stay on . " <p> " That 's not what happened , " Croft interrupted . " He saw that I was becoming famous , you know . He retired , then he tried to grab onto my coattails to keep his name in the limelight . That 's what happened . " <p> They both laugh , knowing the truth : Fame might show up , someday , but even then , it figures to slip in unannounced . There 's no way around that . In boxing , fame does n't run on schedule .
