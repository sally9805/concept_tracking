<p> COMMUNIST Party leaders in this remote township in Guangdong Province had a problem . Two-thirds of the village children could not afford to go to school . Their solution : Return it to the local Christian church . <p> Consequently , the secular leaders of the region were pleased to recently attend the opening of the new Love of Christ Primary School . The four-story concrete building , easily the most modern in the village , is the first primary school in China returned by the Communists to a church . <p> How this came about has much to say about China today , not just about the state of religious freedom , but also of a new official pragmatism . After all , it is one thing to let capitalists run a garment factory , quite another to turn the molding of the next generation over to a church . <p> Indeed , churches in China are undergoing a remarkable , some might say miraculous , rebirth largely through their own efforts . Before the communist takeover in 1949 , more than a century of concerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . Today there are an estimated 12 million . Much of the growth has come in the last five years . <p> Baiwan and its 2,500 villagers are a long , dusty drive north of Guangzhou , the provincial capital of Guangdong Province . <p> It is a world far removed from the bustle and prosperity of the Pearl River delta with Guangzhou and Hong Kong as anchors . Guangdong is one of China 's richest provinces , yet about 60 miles north millions still live in poverty . <p> A poor , rural region <p> The limestone-laced soil is too poor even to grown rice . The staples are taro root and sweet potatoes . Per-capita income was last measured at $ 40 a year . <p> The mountain regions have not been neglected by the provincial authorities . A new cement plant attested to an effort to bring a better employment base , but since there was no real industry here to support this misguided project , and getting cement to markets over the poor dirt roads was too expensive , the plant has since closed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to find jobs in the new factories that are constantly sprouting up around Guangzhou and in the special economic zones next to Hong Kong . But employers tend to shun those who ca n't read or write . Even in a shoe factory illiterate workers can foul things up because they ca n't stamp the proper labels on the boxes or sew labels in the shoes right-side-up . <p> Education too expensive <p> Education is supposed to be free in China . In practice , however , many schools charge tuition to cover the costs . In Baiwan only about 80 of the 350 village children were attending the local school . The other children 's parents could not afford the $ 25 annual tuition , and the township , strapped for funds itself , could not subsidize them . <p> But many of the people of Baiwan and the surrounding area are Christians . They were converted in the 1930s by several Chinese Christians and a Canadian Pentecostal missionary , who plodded north from Guangzhou by horseback . <p> The first to be baptized was Li Yuansu , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s . " By the end of 1936 , more than 200 had been baptized , more than 90 in one occasion , " he says . <p> By the 1940s the local Protestant church had become an important part of village life , and it was about that time it opened the Nan An Village School . The school was confiscated by the Communists after the revolution in 1949 , as were all schools in China , religious or private . <p> The next years were hard for the Baiwan Christians . During the Cultural Revolution ( 1966-1976 ) all open religious activity was suppressed and the village church sanctuary was turned into a barn . <p> " The only thing we could do was cry to God for help , " Mr. remembers . <p> Subsequently , under more relaxed regimes , many churches have reopened in Guangdong Province . The Baiwan church began holding services again in 1986 . It counts 350 members now , only 70 of whom had converted before the Communists came to power . <p> A new program <p> A few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cooperative interdenominational Protestant agency , the Baiwan church began a free literacy program for village children . <p> " Eventually , there were more children in the literacy classes than in the Nan An School , " says Philip Lam of the Hong Kong council . <p> " Seeing this , the church was approached by the township government to find out if it was willing to take over and run the school , " Mr. Lam says . <p> That is why when the first group of Christians from Hong Kong visited the village in the spring of 1994 , the local Communist Party chief , Chen Gexing , was there in the church courtyard wearing a big smile , shaking hands and inviting everyone into the church . <p> There was a reason for the fulsome welcome . <p> The local Christians are no better off than their neighbors . But they have a pipeline into a wealthier Hong Kong community to help raise the $ 150,000 needed to build the new school , furnish it , and pay the salaries of a complement of teachers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Baiwan church and four from the local township government . <p> It is responsible for running the school and providing free primary-school education for about 550 children from the village and the surrounding area . <p> The new school is not overtly religious , however . Rather than crosses or pictures of Jesus , there are portraits of former Premier Zhou Enlai and ex-president Liu Shaoqi on the walls . The teachers are government-trained . It is a secular , public school - run by a church . <p> A new dependency ? <p> Some worry that by turning for financial help to Hong Kong , and to mainly expatriate churches there , the Chinese have begun a new dependency on foreign help . <p> Before the revolution , Chinese Christians were sometimes derided as " rice bowl " Christians , suggesting that their only interest in becoming Christians was for a square meal . It is a stigma that the church has worked hard to live down . <p> The three selfs <p> In the 1950s , after most of the foreign missionaries were expelled , the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( self-governing , self-propagating , and self-financing ) denoting a strong desire to keep the Chinese church free from foreign influences . <p> " There is a danger of a new kind of paternalism emerging , " says Wendell Karsen , director of communications for the Hong Kong Christian Council . <p> " But the Guangdong Christian Council approached us , not the other way around , and they control all the funds , " he explains . <p> But in Baiwan worries about a new paternalism take a back seat to the more pressing problem of getting children educated . <p> After all , it was paramount leader Deng Xiaoping who once famously said , " It does n't matter if the cat is black or white , so long as it catches mice .
