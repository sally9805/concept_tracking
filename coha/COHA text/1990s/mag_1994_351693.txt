Grant at least this much to Kim Il Sung : he certainly knew how to go out with a bang . The last Stalinist dictator managed to die just when the parts of the world most unsympathetic to him would miss the ultimate totalitarian the most . A god-king to his own people , a monster to those he waged war on and a riddle to almost everyone else , the only leader that communist North Korea has ever known perished at such a delicate point of diplomacy that even his sternest ill-wishers were praying that it was not true . Late last week , as Radio Pyongyang nearly sobbed the announcement from a capital glum with rain , the news sent shock waves in widening circles from Seoul , Tokyo and Beijing to Washington , Geneva and the Group of Seven summit in Naples . " He was the greatest of the great men , " intoned Radio Pyongyang . To the U.S. and others , he was merely a great , if unfortunate , necessity . <P> Kim 's death , officially from heart seizure owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when U.S. and North Korean negotiators were just beginning talks in Geneva on the dangerously mounting dispute over Pyongyang 's nuclear program . The first session on Friday was " very useful and productive , " according to U.S. team leader Robert Gallucci  --  and then the report came of Kim 's demise . The North Koreans asked for a suspension of talks , which the Americans understandingly gave . But what worried U.S. officials , including President Bill Clinton as he was awakened at 6:30 a.m. in Naples to hear the news , was who in North Korea or indeed on earth could be expected to command the authority that Kim had wielded in such matters . <P> The man styled by his police state for decades as the Great Leader had seemed to take personal charge of finding a way to end the showdown over accusations that his country was well on its way to building atom bombs . In his meeting last month with Jimmy Carter , Kim virtually overnight defused tensions by promising the former U.S. President that he would freeze the nuclear program . Washington then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set in motion the new attempt at dialogue . The first-ever summit between North and South Korean leaders , slated for July 25 , was another diplomatic triumph for the 82-year-old autocrat . The North has said it still wants to go ahead with the meeting , but with the Great Leader 's funeral now scheduled for July 17 , it will probably be postponed . <P> Internally , Kim 's passing was definitely the end of an era . Foreign diplomats inside the country reported that children were breaking out spontaneously in tears and masses of stunned , flower-laden mourners were filing through the streets . Beyond that , though , the death also signaled a likely accession to power of the spectacularly mysterious Kim Jong Il , the Great Leader 's son and anointed heir . <P> Would he venture peace , threats , war ? Would he last for years , six months , six weeks ? At a press conference in Naples , Clinton said he saw no reason to panic . Though South Korean President Kim Young Sam had ordered his forces on emergency alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top brass that events had revealed " no evident alarming change " and that nothing ) so far warranted beefing up the 35,000 U.S. forces now stationed in the South . Asked what he thought of Kim Jong Il 's prospects , however , the President admitted , " I do n't know how to answer that . "
