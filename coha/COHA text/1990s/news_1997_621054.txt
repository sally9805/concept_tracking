<p> COMMUNISM BEATS DEMOCRACY IN CHINA <p> Editor  --  Jack Page wrote to The Chronicle on July 11 criticizing George Will 's July 3 column on China and the need for democracy in that country . As a frequent traveler to China and a businessman involved there , I can say first hand that Mr. Page 's letter was 100 percent inaccurate and totally slanted toward the China-bashing fervor that is developing here in the U.S. <p> China has made unbelievable progress , both socially and economically , in just the last ten years . Although China 's human rights are far from perfect , the vast populace of China are enjoying a life many only dreamed about . The standard of living and per capita income for all Chinese , especially those outside the major cities , has risen substantially . <p> If China was to allow democracy today without the proper infrastructure that all capitalistic countries enjoy , then they would truly be another disaster , just like the " democratic " Russia that Mr. Page refers to in his letter . No major U.S. corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " democracy is in shambles . Yet every single major U.S. corporation and most others around the world are rushing into China because this " communistic " society has much more to offer . <p> While it is true that most Chinese laws are totally in contrast to many of our Western beliefs , there are changes happening in this area as well , becoming more acceptable to world standards . If you ask Chinese citizens if they want to be like the Russian democracy the U.S. hastily pushed onto Russia or like the Chinese communistic society they are enjoying today , no one will vote for democracy . <p> As the elder military and Communist leadership of China passes away over the next 10 to 15 years , the new entrepreneurial , business and internationally savvy politicians taking over China 's leadership will continue to push the reforms of the late great leader Deng Xiaoping . Those who have been to China and continue to work there can see what is going on and truly speak from first- hand knowledge as to where China is really headed and what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy any day of the week . <p> ROBERT E.

You keep on defending the NEA just because it " only costs each taxpayer $ 1 a year . " Well , think of how many programs that presently exist that " only " cost the taxpayer $ 1 a year and you have the reason why our middle class is stuck in the middle class . <p> Each of these other programs is just as passionately defended by their supporters and just as needless as the NEA . I 'm not saying the arts and entertainment industry should n't be supported with your hard earned dollars  --  but they should not be supported with tax dollars . It 's as simple as that . Let the government do for me only that which I can not do for myself  --  and then maybe I can find a few bucks to go to the movies or the concert or support some starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Give it up , guys ! The government does n't belong in the arts and entertainment business . Go find another cause  --  hopefully one that does n't touch my wallet ! <p> DOTTIE van ECKHARDT <p> Yuba City <p> . <p> DEATH ROW SAGA <p> Editor  --  As writers go , Joan Ryan should stay . One of the very best and in good company . I 'll never know what happened to tomatoes , but writers just get better with time . <p> However . The death row piece had to be a victim of agenda or a tool to rally a dwindlingly dearth of midnight marchers . " Seven former prosecutors want to prevent the execution because at some later date , if new evidence is found , it would be too late . " Are these " former prosecutors " perhaps now on the other side , making certain that today 's group of suspected killers get a novel and original defense , while investing the public 's money , without sharing the book or movie rights ? <p> Why were there no comments from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the story ? The convicted killers did give the girl a burial . Maybe it was n't the kind we 'd be pleased with if it were our daughter . <p> BILL NORTON <p> San Mateo <p> . <p> POX ON UC <p> Editor  --  Regent Ward Connerly 's involvement with and opposition to affirmative action is a disgrace to the human race , not to mention his own race . He has given credence to that old saw " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . " <p> Affirmative action was doing its job , albeit imperfectly , but even a broken leg is fixed , not amputated . Affirmative action gave ( gives ) opportunities to students who , because of their economic and minority status , needed a helping hand to start the climb up the ladder of success . Abolition of affirmative action has put a " pox " on what has been the finest major university system in the nation , if not the world . For shame ! <p> JANE LEVINSOHN <p> Corte Madera <p> . <p> ITALIAN DUDS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing the noisy and unreliable new Breda streetcars , citizens and commissioners were shocked to hear that $ 9 million has already been given to consultants studying these problems . Reporter Ed Epstein writes that another $ 3.4 million has been allocated to this effort . <p> No new ideas were presented Monday and the commission wisely refused to approve any more money for streetcar purchases until some new solutions are found . I think we 'd be wise to cut our losses and send these cars back to their Italian maker ! <p> BILL TRUMBO <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> TRAFFIC NIGHTMARE <p> Editor  --  I have lived and driven an auto in San Francisco for three and a half years , and I 've never waited a minute for Critical Mass . <p> Anyone who drives downtown on a Friday evening should expect to spend a lot of time stuck in traffic due to the silly idea of people trying to drive to work . I have , however , wasted up to an hour waiting for buses delayed by funerals , traffic jams caused by movie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco is a transportation nightmare , and all Mayor Brown can do is blame bikes ? <p> CHRIS S. STEVENS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> MOVE MUSEUM DOWNTOWN <p> Editor  --  As a board member of the San Francisco Zoological Society , whose bond issue passed by a mere 500 votes , I know how difficult it is to garner two-thirds of any vote , so I hope that The Chronicle gives strong encouragement and support to the Fine Arts Museums ' plan to move to downtown San Francisco . <p> A new museum downtown will increase attendance , tourism and donor support . This new location will benefit the city culturally and economically and provide an opportunity for the museum to develop into one of the finest in the United States . <p> JAMES J. LUDWIG <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A NAIL IN THE COFFIN ? <p> Editor  --  Re : July 8 story of the Orpheum Theater legal battle . As a native San Franciscan , I would like to applaud Ms. Dorsey Redland for her courageous stand against the Shorenstein Corporation , whose plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be another nail in the coffin of the wonderful diversity and texture that makes San Francisco such a special place . <p> I know Dorsey Redland to be a woman of principle ever ready to take on the Goliaths of the establishment , to fight ( and win ) for the underdog . Now she is fully engaged in fighting the good fight for herself and to preserve the integrity of one of San Francisco 's loveliest historical landmarks . <p> VALERIE J. McKIMMIE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SOJOURNER 'S CRASH <p> Editor  --  It had to happen . A fender-bender on Mars . It 's bad enough that homo sapiens drive lousy on their own planet , now they 've extended that to another planet . Sheesh !
