hen Annie and Ron Schwend decided to put an addition onto their house in rural Montana , they did n't have to do it alone . The day the siding was scheduled to go up , seven of their closest pals showed up to help pound nails . All the kids spent the warm spring afternoon romping together in the play fort out back ; once the job was done , it was cold beer for the grown-ups , lemonade for the children , and burgers for everyone . Why were these friends so willing to devote a day to helping out at the Schwends ' house ? Because the Schwends do the same for them . " We 've always pitched in for each other , " says Annie . " It just works better . " Joining hands to get the job done is a treasured American tradition . Wagon trains and bam raising , s helped settle the frontier , and that spirit of cooperation seems to be returning now . Some people have actually formalized the idea-setting up cooperative ventures that help them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Today , millions of Americans participate in some kind of co-op organization . What many find , in addition to timesaving support , is a sense of community-increasingly rare in this age of mega-malls . Here , the stories of three such co-ops . Meridian , ID : Feeding the Neighborhood Dee Sarton Bower has two children , a high-powered job as a news anchorwoman in Boise , ID , and an equally busy spouse . But on a quiet Tuesday morning , just a few hours before she has to dash to work , she 's swaying to Kenny G while chopping scallions in her neat blue-and-white kitchen . Pork chops are sizzling , and the spinach salad is ready to roll . Before Bower leaves , she will have made dinner for her family , and for three of her neighbors and their families . The homemade meals will all be delivered to their doors in ready-to-reheat glass casserole dishes . Next Tuesday , she 'll do the same thing all over again-but in between , she 'll hardly cook at all . Monday 's , Wednesdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Several years ago , Bower and three of her friends formed a cooking co-op , which has made the families ' weeknight dinners a stress-free experience . " It was always such a struggle , " says Bower of life before the dinner co-op . " We 'd eat out a lot , or I 'd bring home fast food . My kids were n't eating right , and I was spending a fortune . " Bower also wanted her family to eat together , a feat she could n't quite pull off with a workday schedule that does n't get her home until after 7:00 P.NI. most nights . " If I tried to cook at that hour , it would be eight o'clock before we got dinner on the table , " she recalls . " The kids would be starving , and I 'd be completely frazzled . " But thanks to the co-op , family meals have become routine . And since she 's required to cook on only one weekday , Bower actually looks forward to her morning of shopping , chopping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliver dinner to their neighbors .

" The co-op has taken a lot of stress out of my life . " I lome-based moms in the group are equally appreciative of the chance to avoid the store and the stove for days in a row . " I have more time for my family , " says co-op member Mary Wells , a self-employed desktop publisher and mother of three . " And if the homework 's done , I can even play games with the kids before dinner . " The co-op meets once every six weeks to plan menus , so there 's no guesswork involved when it 's time to cook or shop . The group collectively purchased sets of delivery containers , which are always washed after a meal , then left on the next designated cook 's doorstep . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat loaf , members are encouraged to also prepare their specialties . " You do n't want to get into a rut , " Wells says . " Part of the fun is people bringing in different recipes . " Bower and Wells , who published a book about their co-op experience , Home To Go : The Coomplete Guide to Co-op Cooking ( http. //purifet. net ) , estimate the total cost of preparing a typical dinner for the four families is about $35 . Bower calculates that she 's spending about $2() less a month than she did in her former take-out lifestyle What about finicky kids ? Most of the families have found that the children are more willing to eat something new if it was n't prepared by their own mom or dad . And just in case a particular dish is a no-go with one of her kids , Wells always keeps a box of macaroni and cheese in her pantry . " After a while , you get to know most of the likes and dislikes , " she says . There 's also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new subdivision where they all live into a real neighborhood . The families now get together for a Memorial Day barbecue , a Christmas party , and an occasional parents ' night out . " We trade recipes and stories , borrow aluminum foil and eggs from each other , " says Wells . " But the most important thing is that our children know they have other adults in the community who care about them . " Middletowm Springs , VT : The Town That Shops Together Once a month , a big white truck rumbles up to the clapboard ( Community ( Church in Middletown Springs , loaded with organic produce , natural foods , and herbal cosmetics . It 's " breakdown day " for the 20 families of the What 's Cookin ' Food Co-op , and kids and parents alike come running . As members divvy up the latest shipment and swap cooking secrets , children scamper through aisles of boxes , sneaking samples of cookies , nuts , and dried fruit .

What 's more , she feeds her family of four on organic and natural foods for only $4 ( ! 0 a month through the co-op . Organic produce , in partictilar , is much less expensive than it would be at the supermarket . Bulk ordering from Northeast ( Cooperatives , a natural-foods warehouse in nearby Brattleboro , allows members to get a hefty 15 to 20 percent discount on every item-sometimes more if irs on sale . " About half of us rely on the co-op for all our grocery needs , and about half of us use it to supplement what we get at the store , " explains Colletti , who has n't shopped at a supermarket in eight years . Even those who supplement say the bulk order saves them trips to the storeno small advantage in this rural New England community where the nearest organic supermarket is a half hour 's drive away .

Another member picks up the checks , deposits them in the co-op 's account , and gives the truck driver a group check upon delivery . Members say the opportunity to save money and make new friends is tough to heat . " You really see it on breakdown day-people notice what others have ordered and say , " Oh , what 's that ? " or " What do vcnr you do with that ? " You would n't do that to a stranger in a supermarket , " says leslie Silver , the co-op 's coordinator . " You 're really shopping with friends . " Sausalito , CA : Taking Care of Baby Sausalito is famous for tourists , hot tubs , and beautiful views of San Francisco . But it is also home to a close-knit community of 26 families , members of the 43-year-old Sausalito Babysitting Co-op . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra Gan , , who was recruited to join the group while pregnant with her daughter , Kate , now 13 . " It was like having siblings for her . " The co-op is structured so members can bring their children to the home of another co-op member who has agreed to sit . Each sitter accumulates credits based on how long parents are gone and how many children he or she has looked after . Additional credits are earned if the sitter provides meals . No money is involved . But savings are significant in a town like Sausalito , where babysitting rates of five to twelve dollars an hour can easily double the cost of dinner out and a movie . But the real plus , say members , is in the friendships the kids and parents develop . " Instead of it being this big trauma that Mom and Dad are going out , I start telling my son a day ahead that he 's going to get to go play at John 's house , " says Kathryn Streitmann , mother of 3-year-old Albert .

This acts as a way of screening for like-minded parents when it comes to issues of discipline and diet . Co-op parents recruit new members through play groups , church , preschool , and chance meetings at the park . To help parents and children get to know one another-thus broadening the number of sitters each child will feel comfortahle with-the co-op organizes group activities like trick-or-treating at Halloween . And as the kids grow and form friendships , they know whose houses are within walking or bicycling distance . lany of the families have grown so close over the years that they scx ; ialize on their own time-trading advice and celebrating the milestones of their children 's lives .
