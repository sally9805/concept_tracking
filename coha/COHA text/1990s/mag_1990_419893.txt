SPECIAL REPORT <p> The scourge of drugs has infiltrated corporate America . The casualties : worker productivity and company profits . Now , executives and government officials are teaming up to launch an effective counter- offensive . <p> You devise comprehensive marketing schemes that bolster the company 's bottom line . You can command a staff to manage the thorniest of fiscal dilemmas . There is no business challenge so daunting or issue so calamitous that you ca n't handle it . Right ? <p> So what do you do if a member of your driven , top-notch team is a drug addict ? Even worse , how do you detect it ? You wo n't be able to find the answer to this problem by analyzing a spreadsheet . And , if not spotted and dealt with expeditiously , it can ultimately wreck the effectiveness , both in performance and morale , of the department that you spent so many arduous months  --  and even years  --  building into a powerful revenue generator . <p> In case you have n't heard , John and Jane Q. Manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mortal combat with drugs , an enemy that strikes with the lightning speed of a cobra and whose venom is just as lethal . It has left a trail of casualties from inner-city streets to corporate corridors . <p> The legion of drug abusers continue to mount . A recent survey by the Senate Judiciary Committee estimates that a staggering 2.2 million Americans are hooked on cocaine , far outstripping the figures released previously by the National Institute of Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) , which discovered 862,000 cocaine addicts . As of March , NIDA research indicated that two-thirds of Americans , between the ages of 20 and 40 , have used an illicit drug in the past year while 12% have done so within a 30-day period . Moreover , a recent study conducted by the Gallup Organization Inc. for the Institute For A Drug-Free Workplace , a coalition of major corporations developed to preserve employer and employee rights in drug testing , approximates that 22% of employees polled said illegal drug use was " widespread " in their work environment and another 32% claimed that the sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , cases of life endangerment , including train derailments and plane crashes , are even more telling . Millions of executives have been pulled into the vortex of drug abuse , gaining relief from pressure-cooker jobs in a vial of cocaine . Says Reggie Walton , a former judge who works for the National Drug Policy Board , which coordinates federal antidrug efforts : " There has been a deterioration in the values and morals of American society that is causing people to feel that it 's sort of acceptable conduct to get high and use an excuse that they are doing so to deal with the day to day stress of life . " <p> Translation : Drugs are equal opportunity predators , cutting across racial and class lines to claim its victim . <p> As American business renews its push for quality and faces fierce competitive challenges from domestic and international rivals , the bottom-line question is how do corporate managers-including black professionals-deal with drug abusers and keep the poison from spreading ? If the problem is n't contained quickly , it will mean a less productive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations approximately $100 billion a year , " asserts Dr. Kenneth A . Rivers , a Chicago-based psychiatrist and founding member of the American Academy of Psychiatrists in Alcoholism and Addictions . " Drugs in the workplace means a slowdown in production time , greater absenteeism , an increase in medical insurance and a higher incidence of theft . " <p> Part of the response to the mammoth problem has been the passage of the DrugFree Workplace Act of 1989 , which is part of the Omnibus Drug Initiative Act . For federal contracts of $25,000 or more , the law requires that employers adopt , among other measures , a formal drug abuse policy and notify employees ; establish a drug-free awareness program ; notify contractor agencies within 10 days of any employee who violates drug laws ; and penalize and/or terminate convicted employees . <p> But the legislation is not a cure-all to such an amoebic problem , maintains Rep. Charles Rangel ( D-N.Y. ) , the raspy-voiced legislative veteran who chairs the House Select Committee on Narcotics . " I really do n't believe you can concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't venture to say that prevention is more important than treatment , or that law enforcement is more important than crop eradication . You have to make it difficult to get drugs , and at the same time you have to educate people to prevent them from using drugs . And you have to treat people who have already made the mistake . " <p> Rangel has sponsored laws proposing increased law enforcement , beefed-up border efforts by the military , and programs to convince drug-growing nations to substitute other crops for coca . Now , he is recruiting America 's corporate chieftains for the war on drugs . Recently , he scheduled hearings to gain testimony from economists and business leaders regarding the cost of drugs to the American economy as a whole . <p> With a more intense national spotlight focused on the problem , corporate managers can no longer bury their heads in the sand-they must now heed the Cassandras ' warnings regarding drugs that they have ignored for the past decade . Taking measures from placing undercover narcotics agents in the workplace to developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to break drugs ' siren allure on its workers . <p> The battle is being fought on a number of fronts . The following combatants may provide managers with some clues on how they can win the war in their workplace . The Prosecutor : Putting Away The Dealers <p> High above Foley Square , Manhattan 's court district , Sterling Johnson presides over tightly-structured chaos . Bodyguards wait in the outer office , along with a visiting FBI agent . Down the hall , young prosecutors move in and out of courtrooms where two grand juries are being convened simultaneously . <p> The stocky Johnson takes a phone call from Washington , discussing antidrug offensives being launched in various parts of the globe . Before he can finish a call , he receives a note from his assistant about a live radio interview later in the afternoon . The topic : drugs , of course . <p> When Johnson tells you that " war is hell , " it does not have the ring of a time-worn cliche but serves as a powerful metaphor for ruined lives-drug abusers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's in the trenches , commanding 70-plus attorneys and controlling a $12 million budget in the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor ( OSNP ) , which tries more than 7,000 cases a year . " When the drug problem comes to us that means that all our institutions-the schools , the church and the family-have failed , " says Johnson . " Of the three hundred thousand arrests that the New York police department makes a year , one hundred thousand involve drug-related crimes . That 's one out of every three arrests . " <p> The 55-year-old law executive is seeking to reduce the figure , managing the only office of its kind in the United States , a separate investigative and judicial apparatus devoted exclusively to monitoring and disrupting the city 's major drug networks . Before OSNP was formed in 1971 , different prosecutors from New York 's five boroughs were handling the city 's respective drugrelated felony cases . The result was a maze of different policies and procedures throughout the city 's judicial system , and little , if any , coordination with federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hitting the drug lords where they hurt  --  their pocketbooks . He streamlined the OSNP by creating two separate divisions  --  the investigation bureau , which handles grand jury probes and supervises wiretaps , and the trial bureau , which prosecutes cases . As a result , Johnson has raised the number of annual indictments from about 1,500 in 1980 to more than 7,000 in 1989 . The office 's impressive 80% conviction rate-an average of 15 drug dealers convicted on a daily basis-and seizures of multimilliondollar drug shipments have placed Johnson on several hit lists of Mafia and Colombian drug cartels , which market substances ranging from heroin to " crack , " a smokeable form of cocaine powder that is made by cooking cocaine with baking soda . <p> This kind of commitment to catching the drug lords has its costs . Dogs sniff near Johnson 's home for bombs daily , and he takes a different route to and from work each day . And there are the omnipresent bodyguards . " Fighting crime and dodging death , " Johnson quips as he paces in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start in law enforcement as a street cop . ( With Johnson 's help , the Drug Enforcement Administration in April was able to indict the Cuntrera family , Sicilian Mafia members who have controlled a heroin smuggling network operating on three continents for 30 years , on the charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin . ) <p> Although the bulk of OSNP 's cases involve street narcotic-related offenses , the office 's reach extends to the executive suite . Johnson estimates that 70% of the people who use drugs are employed individuals who need a steady income to support habits that can cost as much as $100 a day . In fact , OSNP has received and carried out requests from corporate managers to send undercover officers into a company to ferret out drug dealers . ( experts estimate that 35% of on-the-job cocaine users sell drugs to coworkers in order to support their habits . ) <p> Such undercover operations ( many corporations also hire private investigators ) usually take between 90 to 120 days in which operatives gain employees ' confidence , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undercover agents are usually placed in such high-traffic positions as custodial or maintenance services , jobs where a drug dealer will have access from the lowest-level employee to a high-ranking executive . <p> The OSNP has entered major corporations in a less clandestine fashion as well . Johnson and his staff have conducted a series of lectures to employees of multinational corporations on the effects of drug abuse and how managers can spot drug offenders . " We have found drug dealers in businesses and industries across the board , " says Johnson . " In fact , some of our biggest busts to date have been on Wall Street . At most companies , employees know who is using and selling drugs . It 's as secret as an office romance . " <p> Johnson expects to have a larger role in local and national drug enforcement policy . One of his pet peeves is the fact that New York  --  unlike 33 other states-allows " crack " pipes and other drug paraphernalia o be sold legally . ) To help determine a greater corporate role in the war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drug Advisory Committee , whose 7 members include General Motors Chairman Roger Smith and General Electric CEO Robert Welch . Maintains Johnson : " My concern is that there are a lot of technical jobs in the 21 st century and with an impaired work force , American business is going to have a hard time surviving . How can America expect to be competitive globally ? We are developing a nation of zombies . " The Managers : Pushing Corporate Wellness <p> These days , employees can find information on the latest drug policy in their office newsletter , sandwiched between the announcements about company picnics and office promotions . Among the concerns taking the message directly to its employees is Trans Jones Inc. /Jones Transfer Co. , the $78.5 million Monroe , Mich. , trucking firm ( No. 7 on the 1990 BE INDUSTRIAL/SERVICE 100 ) . <p> Under the Drug-Free Workplace Act , Trans Jones and all transportation companies are mandated by the federal government to institute drug-testing programs and are required to examine interstate , over-the-road drivers . According to rules specified by the Department of Transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for marijuana , cocaine , opiates , amphetamines and PCP . If employers want to test for other drugs , such as alcohol and barbituates , they must obtain second , separate samples . <p> Additionally , in order to make a " good-faith effort " to maintain a drug-free work environment , the federal government also stresses that companies make education and counseling available . ( Other types of concerns that have government contracts with DOT and the Department of Defense are also required to adopt similar measures . ) <p> The act , however , may place some employers in a quandary about their in-house drug policy . Employers must report . employees convicted of drug use and take disciplinary measures against them . Federal regulators , however , could take away government contracts if employers report too many employee drug convictions . Another big problem arises when employers try to fire a drug abuser who has not been convicted . Some state laws define drug addicts as handicapped individuals and prohibit job discrimination against them . <p> Controlling Trans Jones ' drug abatement apparatus is Zannie H. Brazley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Trans Jones after working approximately 12 years at United Parcel Services . Brazley 's maxim : " Healthy minds and bodies lead to more productive employees . " <p> A closer look at Brazley 's quality control program reveals how such an operation can be developed and administered . Under the Trans Jones plan , all applicants for driving positions take drug tests . After testing negative and being hired by the company , employees must submit to tests during their annual physical . Of the more than 600 truck drivers employed at Trans Jones , only two have tested positive . " If managers suspect drug use , a driver can be confronted and made to test , " says Brazley . " Refusal could equal penalties up to and including termination . " <p> Trans Jones uses more than one testing center so the drivers do n't feel as if they are being railroaded . Also , Brazley and other top managers  --  including the CEO  --  submit to drug tests to determine whether the clinics are doing their job effectively and thoroughly . <p> If a driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical review officer . After going over the results of the test with the employee , the medical review officer will contact Brazley . The driver then is given a chance to explain the situation and put in contact with a counselor . The employee is released from payroll until the counselor gives him or her a clean bill of health . Upon retesting and negative test results , the employee is placed back on payroll with the stipulation that he or she can be tested at random three times over the next year . If the driver tests positive on future examinations , the employee will be terminated immediately . <p> Trans Jones officials do n't believe in casting out drug abusers as if they were company lepers , though . They have developed a comprehensive employee assistance program ( EAP ) that provides counseling for problem-plagued workers . The EAP , which is confidential and voluntary , offers three annual counseling sessions to each employee and every member of the household . The EAP , which handles problems ranging from alcohol and drug abuse to domestic violence , includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify themselves as Trans Jones workers . ( To make the program more accessible , counseling numbers are placed on pay stubs . ) Brazley receives a report , without names , documenting the race and gender of employees and details on problems the service handled . As another layer of oversight , Brazley chairs the EAP committee , a body with representation from all departments within the company that reviews the efficacy of the program . <p> All front-line supervisors , Brazley says , are trained to spot and approach potential offenders , noting such characteristics as slippage in performance , absenteeism and aberrant behavior . But more than one person 's comments are needed before an employee can be confronted . <p> " No one feels comfortable coming forward and saying they have a problem . You and I know that it is a reality that a certain percentage of your employees are going to have a problem . We wanted to have a program that is uniform for all the employees as well as the drivers , " says Brazley , taking a tough-love posture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Another BE 100s company , H.J. Russell &; Co. , a $132 million Atlanta-based construction firm ( No. 4 on the 1990 BE INDUSTRIAL/SERVICE 100 ) saw the importance of adopting similar measures two years ago . The concern instituted preemployment drug screening for every potential candidate and also trained management personnel to identify drug abusers . Says Valencia H. Rashad , the concern 's human resources and insurance manager : " Managers look for probable cause . The employees must submit to drug testing or face discipline up to and including termination . " <p> Such measures are n't universal . At AI Copeland Enterprises Inc. , the parent company of the Popeye 's &; Church 's Fried Chicken chains , there is no testing program or in-house counseling for its 30,000 employees . In fact , the company 's human resources officials warn managers not to confront workers about drug use because it might create legal problems . Counseling can be suggested , however . <p> To ensure productivity and overall safety , most companies are adopting drug tests and employee assistance programs , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-owned companies , because they tend to be smaller in size and revenues , do n't have such comprehensive testing and counseling programs . But not having a policy can also be costly : Drug addicted employees can cost a company between 5% and 10% of payroll . The Counselors : Seeking The Root Of The Problem <p> The drug war is as much external as it is internal . Corporate stress , peer pressure and a family history of substance abuse can all play individual and collective roles in the development of a drug addict . Sometimes , the only thing an empathetic manager can do is identify a colleague or worker with a problem and send him or her to a treatment program . Asserts Kenneth Rivers : " Treatment , not punishment , is the key to solving drug abuse in our schools and the workplace . We as a society will have to take more time and money to educate people with such addictive disorders . " <p> There are a number of programs , including substance abuse hot-lines and encounter groups , that managers can refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recovering cocaine addict Spencer Haywood has developed a videotape , adopted as a part of the employee wellness programs of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors , to get substance abusers on the long road to recovery . But are such measures truly effective ? Experts estimate that about 66% of the addicts are successfully treated through counseling and drug treatment programs , which means that they have abstained from drug use for at least two years . But , at the same time , reformed addicts must realize that they have to live with life-long maladies . <p> Judging by the executive and the nature of his or her problem , all drug treatment programs may not be productive . Nate Mack and Kenneth Beverly found that out the hard way . In the course of recovering from drug addiction , the two men realized that much of the therapy to combat drug abuse does n't take into account certain realities of African-American life . After a chance meeting at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting , the two men formed Coalesce , an Atlanta-based private treatment center that specializes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Our goal is to treat and identify black emotional pain-that 's what substance abuse is all about , " says Mack , a former corporate salesman . <p> Part of Coalesce 's therapy involves going into the home of an addicted patient to meet family members and begin the healing process by identifying the source of the problem . The emphasis is on communication , so that inner conflicts can be shared , not bottled up . <p> Coalesce , which has already served about 300 clients nationwide , grew from the same need that inspired the founding of the St. Paul , Minn. - based Institute on Black Chemical Abuse 15 years ago : traditional therapy methods can be hindered or even fail because black people do not communicate easily with whites when it comes to personal matters . " The fact that you are expected to open up publicly in a group of white people and share pretty deep personal stuff is very alien to a lot of blacks , " notes Mack . " They 're in a situation where they have to talk about themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier . " <p> Treatment by Coalesce is expensive  --  it costs $13,000 for 30 days of in-house treatment and 90 days of outpatient followup . In most cases , the bill can be paid through an insurance provider . <p> ( For information on other treatment alternatives , contact the Partnership For A Drug-Free America , 212-922-1560 or the Institute for Black Chemical Abuse , 612-871-7878 . ) Many executives , afraid of being stigmatized for the rest of their careers , fear the idea of making treatment for addiction part of their financial professional record . Rivers says that there is a grave concern among executives-especially black professionals-about being placed on company " hit lists , " in which career advancement will be stalled , if not blocked , if it is discovered that they have a problem . It may be just as tough for black managers to confront and accuse white subordinates about having a drug problem as well . <p> All executives must remember that when the pressures become too great , they must push their employees  --  and themselves  --  to seek help . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When blacks move up the corporate ladder , they work harder , have greater expectation and more isolation than their white counterparts , " says Rivers . " If the environment does n't have a support system , that can lead to depression and anxiety . Professionals should join black professional and trade associations to network and gain a sense of camraderie . Everyone needs to know that they are not out there alone . " <p> Drug-afflicted workers , from the mailroom to the executive suite , are not alone . Corporate managers are not ready to raise the white flag in the middle of the drug war : A more aware and better prepared corps of black executives are readier than ever to fight for life , career and company . WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE <p> It is not easy to see a colleague or subordinate deteriorate before your very eyes . Many simply deny that their workers have a substance abuse problem . To take such a tack can be disastrous . Not only do drug abusers cost the company money in loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be endangering the lives of the public , especially if they are employed in such industries as transportation and construction . <p> The Department of Labor suggests the following measures for determining-and acting on-drug abuse problems : Identify characteristics of substandard performance within your department , including increases in accidents , theft and absenteeism . Consult with other departments within the company to discuss similar activities and to gauge company-wide substance abuse problems . Get workers ' views on problems and determine whether the problems are undermining health , safety and security in the workplace . Assess the damage of drugs in the workplace by comparing substance abuse data with workers ' views and opinions . Consult the personnel department for company policy regarding drug abuse and the legal ramifications of confronting an employee suspected of having such an addiction . ( Make sure that another person has witnessed the suspected employees ' aberrant behavior so you do not leave yourself or your employer open to a defamation suit . ) <p> The DOL and antidrug experts advise managers to adopt the following initiatives : Foster a commitment to a drug-free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employees . Develop a program to promote drug prevention , education and training of personnel . Establish means , including drug testing , to identify drug users . Develop employee assistance or in-house counseling programs . Compose an assessment of suspected drug users and , if necessary , refer them to treatment centers . After treatment , provide an evaluation system for recovering addicts before reintegrating them into the corporate mainstream . <p> By Errol T. Louis and Frank McCoy <p>
