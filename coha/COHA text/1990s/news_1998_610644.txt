<p> The McDonald 's at 6400 Macedonia Commons Blvd. looks like most of the other 12,000 or so McDonald 's in the United States . A generic gray edifice , complete with drive-through and Playland , it sits at the intersection of State Road 8 and Route 271 , about halfway between Akron and Cleveland . It 's next to a Ground Round , which is next to a KFC , which is next to an Applebee 's . No one goes hungry on Macedonia Commons Boulevard . <p> Like all the other McDonald 's , this one offers a faint , instantly recognizable odor . It 's the smell of Double Quarter Pounders With Cheese , Filets-O-Fish and dimethyl polysiloxane-enhanced Chicken McNuggets . It 's the smell that millions of low-wage workers take home with them every night  --  the smell of blood , sweat and Special Sauce . <p> To Bryan Drapp  --  19-year-old fry cook , burger griller and labor organizer  --  it 's the smell of victory . For this is no ordinary McDonald 's . This is the one that made history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the textbooks : that week when 20 kids took a stand against The Man , who in this case wears a yellow suit and a red wig and calls himself Ronald . The time when this cry was heard across the land : " Service-sector workers of the world unite ! " <p> Drapp and his mostly teenage cohorts  --  who , yes , have pimples and patches of facial hair sprouting in odd places like they 're supposed to  --  did something in mid-April that no one else in America seems to have done since a visionary named Ray Kroc opened up a burger joint in Illinois 43 years ago . They went on strike against the nation 's best-known restaurant chain , in an industry where organized labor is an anomaly . And they got what they wanted  --  a little respect and a little more cash . <p> After picketing in the cold rain and harsh sun in their baseball caps and Air Jordans , carrying placards that complained " Overworked , Underpaid , " and enduring the jokes of Jay Leno and Howard Stern , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them , hoping to leverage the short-lived McDonald 's strike into an example of labor 's resurgence . These teens are heroes to a lot of people around here . And a headache for McDonald 's well-greased PR machine . <p> But their managers  --  oh , they 're being real , real nice . While the crew still has to mop the bathroom floor , refill the napkin holders and assemble the Big Macs ( dehydrated onions , two hamburger patties , etc. ) , at least now they 're doing it with dignity . <p> " They 're so much nicer to me than before , " Drapp says of his superiors . " They say , ' Could you please do this if you have the time ? ' I 'm loving it . " <p> For anyone who 's ever slung hash or worn a hairnet , it 's a feeling just as valuable as a sheaf of stock options and a seat on the board of directors . <p> We live in a fast-food , fast-paced age , of which McDonald 's is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenets of instant gratification and assembly-line speed , prepackaged goodness and artificiality . McHappiness . <p> Except not everybody 's happy . <p> The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting more McDonald 's visors . While daily headlines trumpet the ascendance of the all-powerful Dow and increasingly titanic corporate mergers , the service sector is where most of America 's new jobs are being created . Many of them are McJobs , a term that has come to signify all jobs characterized by low pay , few benefits and no future . <p> Regardless of whether a $ 5.85-an-hour job beneath the golden arches meets all these requirements  --  and McDonald 's will have you know it does n't  --  it is , by definition , the original McJob . If Marx were alive , he 'd probably be handing out the spiffy new edition of his manifesto in Macedonia ( pop . 12,000 , home to such companies as Century Products , the car baby-seat manufacturer ) . <p> Wearing a visor , black apron and magenta shirt ( blue-and-purple shirts are for management and crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often in nine-hour shifts that begin at 6 a.m . For each shift he is granted one half-hour break , which he takes at his supervisor 's discretion . He has burns on his arms from working the grill and circles under his eyes from lack of sleep ( he also attends classes two days a week at the University of Akron ) . <p> Some of the kids who joined his strike come from similar circumstances : They 're children of the Rust Belt , slogging hard to get ahead . Their small show of force resonated in a part of the country where industrial jobs once ruled . " Everybody should be treated with dignity , " says Dominic Tocco , president of Cleveland 's Teamsters Local 416 , which rushed to represent the workers . " I do n't care if they make $ 5 an hour or $ 500 . " <p> Had the Teamsters unionized the Macedonia McDonald 's  --  the strikers settled for an agreement with management , which is all they really wanted  --  it apparently would have been the first in 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe and Mexico , but the only reported success in America came in the early ' 70s when the United Food and Commercial Workers unionized a McDonald 's in Mason City , Iowa , for four years . <p> McDonald 's and the rest of the fast-food industry have been notoriously anti-union . In February , a McDonald 's in St. Hubert , Quebec , permanently shut down in the middle of a union drive by its employees , sparking a nationwide labor movement to organize McDonald 's workers . <p> The fast-food industry works on a small profit margin , which unionization would make even smaller . " The whole competitive edge McDonald 's has is that the food 's cheap , " notes Michael Kaizen , a labor historian at American University . " If unions get there , prices will probably rise , so the company can be counted on to fight unionization from the beginning . " <p> Of course the lack of organized labor is not just a reflection of the employers ' wills but of the logistics of the industry . Employees work in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turnover is high . Many are teenagers in their first jobs ; they do n't plan to make a career out of fast food . They are loath to reduce their already low wages by paying union dues . " These relatively young workers never are able to establish what is known in labor relations parlance as a ' community of interest , ' " says Douglas McCabe , a professor of industrial and labor relations at Georgetown University . <p> But despite the stereotype mocked on " The Simpsons " and " Beavis and Butt-head , " McDonald 's is not staffed entirely by teens . There are older people who flip burgers to supplement Social Security , to keep up their car payments or raise a family . For them , McDonald 's is the only option  --  and they , Drapp says , are the ones he was trying to help . People like Margaretha DeLollis , 66 , one of the oldest workers at the Macedonia McDonald 's . <p> The Spark On April 8 , DeLollis , a Netherlands native who moved to Ohio 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage bags in the cans every 15 minutes  --  standard procedure during the lunch rush . She did n't want to have to go to the back of the restaurant every time she needed a new bag , so she left a stack of spares out in the open . <p> That did n't look like proper McDonald 's behavior to Jerry Guffey , a franchise management employee . He grabbed her arm and yelled at her , she told local newspapers . Guffey also reportedly ordered the gray-haired worker to " use your legs . " <p> DeLollis cried and ran out of the restaurant . " I felt like a little girl , " she told the Akron Beacon Journal . <p> Bryan Drapp was at the grill wrapping burgers , and says he saw the whole thing . After DeLollis left , Guffey asked Drapp to clean the lobby  --  DeLollis 's job . Drapp refused . He says Guffey took him to the back office and said , " Your job is to do whatever I tell you . " <p> Drapp walked out , furious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Jed Greene , the owner and operator of the Macedonia franchise , now acknowledges that " mistakes were made , " as the saying goes , and he admits that communication broke down . ) <p> Drapp is a toothy , popular kid with fairly typical tastes  --  fond of rappers like Scarface and Master P , wearing his baseball cap low on his head , calling people he does n't like " punks "  --  but he does n't consider himself a troublemaker or a hothead . In the course of his McDonald 's tenure  --  he 's been there two years  --  he had quit once before . A manager was too demanding , he says . But Drapp came back when that manager left ; he needed the money . He lives at home with his father , a computer repairman , and his mother , who takes care of his grandmother . <p> He and other workers say their problems were never addressed . Supplies were hard to find and equipment did n't work properly . The pay scale was out of sync ; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker earning $ 6.50 . The store was understaffed  --  managers swore and customers yelled , especially during the hectic Teeny Beanie Babies promotions . <p> After his April 8 walkout in support of his older comrade , Drapp still wanted to work at McDonald 's . He came back a couple of hours later and tried to find out if it was okay to return for his next scheduled shift , on Good Friday . But he says Guffey  --  who is the franchise 's human relations supervisor  --  would n't speak to him . <p> Drapp punched in bright and early on Good Friday . Meanwhile , he 'd decided on a plan . He secretly told it to the other workers : He wanted them to go on strike . <p> Drapp had never even seen a strike before , except on TV . " We mostly talk about sports , " says his father , Jeff , " not labor and Teamsters . " <p> Not wanting to quit , and unable to get management to speak to him , Drapp figured he had to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickens was the first co-worker Drapp talked to about the strike . Tall , thin and quiet , Nickens , 20 , has known Drapp since high school , and now also attends the University of Akron . Like Drapp , he studies business and wants to own his own establishment one day . <p> To afford school , Nickens has to work two other jobs in addition to McDonald 's : landscaping and running the video arcade at a horse track . Some days he works at all three jobs . During the summer , when he works the most , he averages about four hours of sleep a night . Both he and Drapp make $ 6.50 an hour at McDonald 's . <p> Nickens had also seen problems at work , and also had quit before . " They 're authoritarian , " he says . " You were their slave . " <p> Promises went unfilled , Nickens says ; he was supposed to get $ 25 for referring Drapp and getting him hired two years ago . The money did n't come through until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickens met at the store at 6 but stood on the other side of the parking lot , near a flagpole that flies two flags  --  one for America and one for McWorld . The night before , Drapp had bought some poster board . " Mom , I 'm going to Wal-Mart , " he told his mother . She tried to talk him out of striking , but then , resigned , she told him to be careful . <p> When the managers arrived to help open the store , they did n't quite understand what Drapp and Nickens were doing , and pleaded with them to come back in . Several other crew members showed up and also stayed outside . <p> Management scrambled ; workers from Jed Greene 's other two franchises in the area came , and a call went out to McDonald 's regional corporate office in Independence , Ohio , which sent down consultants and executives  --  and their spouses and children  --  to work the store . Some came straight from church . The Macedonia franchise finally opened at 10 , three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew , mainly teenagers , gathered on Sunday , holding signs like " Honk for Compassion " and " Did Somebody Say Unqualified Management ? " ( playing off the current McDonald 's ad campaign , " Did Somebody Say McDonald 's ? " ) . Some other crew members , especially older ones with families to feed , expressed their support but went inside to work because they needed the money . Margaretha DeLollis was among them . <p> The timing was crucial  --  since it was spring break , most of the high schoolers did n't mind hanging out all day on a picket line . A week earlier or a week later , and Drapp and Nickens , who had to skip their college classes , would have had a very lonely strike . <p> Management pleaded with them to come back in , offering to discuss their demands , but the strikers had not formalized their grievances yet . When the list was written , it ranged from the mundane  --  fully equipped first-aid kits , written reviews and posted schedules  --  to the angry : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Tuesday , the news media had begun to arrive , though neither Drapp or Nickens contacted them . ( Reviewing his news appearances on video after the strike , Drapp remarked , " There 's some good-looking news ladies , I 'll tell you that . " ) Passersby were showing their support by honking and , the employees claim , choosing to eat elsewhere . But some yelled insults like " Get a real job ! " <p> Radio talk host Howard Stern called and , Drapp says , " ripped me apart . " <p> " He told me to stick two pieces of cheese on my butt and sit on the grill and make a ' stupid sandwich , ' " Drapp says , cracking up . <p> Jay Leno joked that among the strikers ' demands were " more pimples . " He also featured a running skit in which the strikers were intimidated and beaten by fast-food mascots like Ronald McDonald , Col. Sanders and Wendy . In one , Ronald tortures a striker by applying a hot McDonald 's apple pie to his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ground Round , Applebee 's  --  came by to offer job applications , but that 's not what the strikers wanted . " A lot of deejays said , ' If you do n't like it there , go to Taco Bell , ' " recalls Drapp 's mother , Dianne . " But that 's not what Bryan was about . He did n't want another job . He wanted to change things . " <p> The Teamster <p> Dominic Tocco  --  whose local represents a nearby aerosol-can factory and an electronics firm  --  had heard about the strike on the radio and decided to stop by on his way to work to buy the kids doughnuts and coffee . After finding out who he was , they said they wanted to be Teamsters . <p> Morale had been waning among the strikers  --  some of the teens were calling in sick to Nickens and Drapp or whining about wanting to go back to work . The presence of the Teamsters pumped them up . " McDonald 's was so intimidating to these kids , " Tocco says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would n't be intimidated . We were there to level the playing field . " <p> Twenty people  --  half of the store 's employees  --  signed union cards , authorizing Tocco to try to represent them . <p> As Tocco spread the word , Teamsters from around the area  --  auto workers , steelworkers , electrical workers  --  descended on 6400 Macedonia Commons Blvd. to offer food and support . For some , the sight of Teamsters was troubling . The ongoing David and Goliath story now had another Goliath , and some parents worried that the strikers were caught in the middle . <p> But the teens say that the Teamsters were not pushing an agenda ( except , perhaps , to score some positive publicity ) . They advised the strikers but did n't interject typical Teamster demands  --  like health care benefits and yearly wage increases . <p> Tocco says he just wanted to give the fledgling unionists a hand . " I have two sons  --  Dominic , 21 , and Giovanni , 19 , " he says . " If my boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd want them standing outside on a picket line , too . " <p> McDonald 's management was not particularly impressed by the presence of the Teamsters . " It just increased the number of people out there holding signs , " says Mike Henry , regional marketing manager for McDonald 's in Independence . They had scheduled a meeting Wednesday afternoon with the strikers at a nearby Holiday Inn . But they insisted that the meeting be McDonald's-only : no Teamsters . The strikers did n't show . <p> Meanwhile , other people  --  mainly adults  --  were filling out McDonald 's job applications . <p> On Thursday , April 16 , the strikers felt the tide turning . The presence of the Teamsters helped convince a UPS driver and a hamburger bun delivery man not to cross the picket line , the strikers say . At 4 p.m. , six of the strikers met with management in the back of the store , with the provision that they could show any proposed agreement to Tocco . After two hours , a resolution was reached and the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " People skills " classes for management . <p> A week 's paid vacation after one year of full-time service ( 35 hours a week )  --  an idea contributed by the Teamsters . <p> Retroactive salary hikes to cover any increases in the federal minimum wage ( currently $ 5.15 ) . For example , if a crew member is making $ 6.50 and the minimum wage goes up by 50 cents , the worker will make $ 7 . <p> " No repercussions and/or consequences for the strikers due to the voicing of our issues and concerns . " <p> Management , however , refused the workers ' demand to fire Jerry Guffey . <p> ' I Truly Am Sorry ' <p> Sitting in a nearby Bob Evans the weekend after the strike , two McDonald 's representatives  --  Jed Greene and Dwight Bungo  --  sip coffee and tell a somewhat different story . But they 're clearly apologetic . <p> " I truly am sorry it happened , " says Greene , a 34-year McDonald 's veteran who began as a crew employee in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents . " I just have to learn to listen a little bit better . " <p> Bungo , a consultant to the regional corporate headquarters , takes issue with some of the strikers ' claims . Most significantly , the hamburger buns were delivered , he says , playing down the importance of the Teamsters . ( The president of the New Horizons Baking Co. in Norwalk , Ohio , also says the delivery was made . ) <p> Bungo and Greene prefer not call the resolution a " labor agreement . " They call it an " action plan . " And they emphasize that this strike was a unique incident that will probably have no major repercussions . <p> That 's also the view from McDonald 's corporate headquarters in Oak Brook , Ill . " This is an isolated thing handled by a local owner-operator , " says spokeswoman Lisa Howard , sounding very bored . Another spokeswoman refuses to even use the word " strike . " <p> Given that the strike was against local management , not against McDonald 's as a whole , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tocco has received hundreds of phone calls . Employees from five McDonald 's in Akron called for union cards , he says . A franchise owner from California called to make sure he was treating his employees fairly , as did a local Taco Bell manager . <p> " This is a wake-up call for people who are running these places , " Tocco brags . <p> At the Macedonia McDonald 's , managers have until the end of April to comply with all the terms of the agreement , and Tocco will be watching to make sure they do . He 's made the ex-strikers " associate Teamsters , " meaning they do n't have to pay any dues . <p> Meanwhile , the star strikers have returned to the fryers . Greene has been spending more time with them , too , shoveling hash browns into paper sacks for the Sunday-morning breakfast crowd . <p> Drapp is waiting for confirmation of an invitation to appear on " The Tonight Show . " Nickens is enjoying his managers ' newfound politeness . " They 've been kissing up to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeling from the picket line . " But I do n't know if it 'll last . " <p> His shift over , he takes off his apron and leaves the kitchen , where Drapp is still hastily assembling Quarter Pounders and Big Macs . <p> Nickens sits down at a table with a reporter from a socialist newspaper , Workers World . Drapp watches from the grill . <p> Workers World ? He 's never heard of it .
