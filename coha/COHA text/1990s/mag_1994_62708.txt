Ready to Repeat ? // It would probably be as big a mistake to go crazy over North Carolina 's splendid 87-77 win over Duke last Saturday night as it was to saddle the Tar Heels with all that preseason hype about their being unbeatable . For 40 sparkling minutes in disbelieving Cameron Indoor Stadium , Carolina was , finally , the many-splendored team that everyone had been awaiting since practice began on Nov. 1 . But as the Duke fans filed out , hoping for another shot at the hated Heels in this week 's ACC tournament , the question still hung in the air : How did the team that was supposed to blow away the nation lose six times during the regular season and finish second to Duke in the ACC ? // All season long there has seemed to be an understanding among college basketball 's pundits that the Tar Heels are above criticism , that anybody who questioned their performance could end up looking foolish when the NCAA tournament rolled around . Every time North Carolina lost , the analysts chattered all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne Buckingham was probably closer to the truth when he said after the Tigers ' Feb. 17 upset of the Heels , " People are n't afraid of North Carolina anymore . " // Last Saturday morning , sitting in his office after practice , Tar Heel coach Dean Smith admitted that this has been perhaps the most frustrating of the 33 teams he has coached in Chapel Hill . " We 're probably not as tight a team as we were last year , " he said . // Even before the Heels played their first game , Smith was complaining that he had too much talent . In place of forward George Lynch and reserve guard Henrik R ? dl , the only meaningful players lost to graduation from last season 's championship team , Carolina had super freshmen Rasheed Wallace , Jerry Stackhouse and Jeff McInnis . Even when Smith decided to redshirt senior forward Pat Sullivan in order to alleviate his numbers problem , he still had nine players in a system that has always worked best with an eight-man rotation . As a result , chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been in the campus 's chem labs . // To a man , Smith and his players deny speculation that there has been bad blood between the veterans and the freshmen . But except for point guard Derrick Phelps , the upperclassmen have been so inconsistent that the rookies ca n't be blamed for thinking they should get more playing time . For example , it has been obvious for a long time that the 6 ' 10 " Wallace , who 's hitting 63.7% of his shots and leads the team in blocks with 56 , deserves to start ahead of 7-foot senior Kevin Salvadori . Yet Smith stuck with Salvadori until last week , when he benched him for the second half of the 68-61 loss to Wake Forest , then started Wallace in his place against Duke . In 32 sparkling minutes Wallace scored 14 points . // Last week Phelps acknowledged the frustration felt by the freshmen when he said , " You 've just got to sit back and deal with it and wait your turn . It took a while when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time would come . I do n't know what our freshmen expect this year . That 's up to them . But you can see them get frustrated . " // Frustration has not been confined to the freshmen , though . Perhaps the most inconsistent Tar Heel has been 7-foot senior center Eric Montross . He was a consensus preseason pick as the nation 's best big man , but he headed into the ACC tournament ranked only fourth among the conference 's centers in scoring , and sixth in both rebounding and blocks . At one point NBA director of scouting Marty Blake issued an uncharacteristically harsh appraisal of Montross , saying he lacked athleticism and did n't have a complete game . Blake said that , as NBA prospects go , Montross was comparable to journeyman Greg Dreiling. // One theory on Montross 's poor play is that early in the season he was distracted by his friendship with Jason Clark , a 16-year-old cancer patient from Durham . Montross was so moved by Jason 's plight that he put the initials JC on his basketball shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died on Feb. 21 , and two nights later Montross ended a string of bad games with one of his best of the season , scoring 23 points and grabbing 11 rebounds against Notre Dame . // Carolina has also been hurt by injuries . Junior guard Donald Williams missed nine games and has struggled to regain his shooting touch . And at small forward , senior Brian Reese , who injured an ankle on the second day of practice , has played as if he were looking over his shoulder at Stackhouse , the team 's third-leading scorer , with a 12.0 average . Only in recent games has Reese again become the slashing force he was last season . // Stackhouse claims not to care who starts , and , indeed , he looked quite pleased after the win at Cameron . The victory was particularly satisfying because Stackhouse is a friend of Duke star Grant Hill 's ; the two met years ago at a summer camp . Since Stackhouse arrived at Carolina , he and Hill have talked frequently on the phone and have even gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bet on the first game , " said Stackhouse , referring to the Heels ' 89-78 win over the Blue Devils on Feb. 3 . " He had to pick up the check on that one . " // It remains to be seen whether the Tar Heels can use the most recent win over Duke to launch a postseason run at another title , drawing inspiration from the second-half masterpiece they delivered after trailing 40-39 at the break . They hit 60% from the field during the final 20 minutes , made only two turnovers and played such suffocating defense that Hill , who had 14 points in the first half , added only four after intermission . " We 're not that good , " said the ever pessimistic Smith . // The Heels do enter postseason play with renewed hope and restored respect . Asked about the chances of an NCAA tournament repeat this season , Phelps said , " With this team you never know what might happen . Sometimes we take teams for granted that do n't have the same talent that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tar Heels ' performance against Duke . " We needed a big one on the road against a great team , " he said . " If we keep on playing like this , we 'll be hard to beat . "
