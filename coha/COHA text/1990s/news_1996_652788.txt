<p> " O.K. , HERE WE GO , " whispers Andrew Heyward as the moment of truth arrives promptly at 6:30 , with Dan Rather beginning his delivery of " The CBS Evening News . " Mr. Heyward is in the program 's main control room at CBS 's broadcast center on West 57th Street in Manhattan , just a few feet from the command post where the executive producer , Jeffrey Fager , is cuing Mr. Rather . <p> Mr. Heyward , who sat in Mr. Fager 's chair until three months ago , when he was named president of CBS News , is the only person in this frantic cockpit with nothing much to do . These days , he usually watches the program back in his office with other executives . But at the moment he seems very much at home in this room of a hundred flashing screens . His eyes  --  the eyes of a longtime television producer  --  dart from screen to screen , checking the camera angles , checking the next story , checking to see what NBC is opening with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate that a man accustomed to the chaos of the control room has been tapped to run CBS News . The job , it is generally agreed , will require a sharp eye , a steady hand and decisive moves , with little time for reflection . By the time of Mr. Heyward 's appointment in January , the problems plaguing the house of Murrow and Cronkite had become so severe that they called for immediate action . Mr. Heyward has responded . <p> In recent weeks , changes have been announced in several key CBS News programs , including " 60 Minutes " ( which will introduce new commentators and a revised format tonight at 7 ) , " 48 Hours " and " CBS This Morning . " At the same time , there has been noticeable fine-tuning of " Evening News . " The new president has had varying degrees of input on all of these changes and others yet to come . <p> " We 're attacking on many fronts , " says Mr. Heyward , a graying , fast-talking man who tends to engage in five-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pager on his belt . He believes that his familiarity with the programs , producers and stars has helped him get off to a quick start . " It would have taken an outsider a year just to learn the culture here , " he says . " And we do n't have a year . " <p> The urgency at CBS News was brought on by a series of missteps in the last several years , some of which Mr. Heyward 's predecessor , Eric Ober , was blamed for by many outside observers . " He made some poor decisions , " says Andrew Tyndall , whose weekly newsletter , The Tyndall Report , monitors network news . <p> Mr. Ober presided over an ill-fated on-air experiment that paired Mr. Rather with a co-anchor , Connie Chung . It was also under his watch that " 60 Minutes " suffered a blow to its image when it was prevented by CBS management from running an interview with a former tobacco-company executive because a lawsuit had been threaten 'd . ( Mr. Ober did not return calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , CBS News has been affected by problems that were beyond the news division 's control . Viewership for its programs suffered when the network lost eight important affiliate stations and their large local audiences ( the stations defected to Fox two years ago ) . The division also saw its staff cut by almost 40 percent by Laurence A. Tisch , who owned CBS before it was acquired last fall by Westinghouse . <p> With spending restricted , CBS News could n't attract high-profile talent , and it still has n't taken steps into cable television , as have NBC and ABC . " The news division had its hands tied behind its back by Laurence Tisch , " says Steve McClellan , the New York bureau chief of Broadcasting and Cable magazine . <p> All these problems were awaiting Mr. Heyward , 45 , when he took over as president . On the bright side , Mr. Heyward started under a new owner that promised to invest in the network . Mr. Heyward quickly took Westinghouse up on that offer , securing additional financing and staffing for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOW " 60 MINUTES " WILL RUN new episodes year-round and will feature more late-breaking news stories and three new commentators in addition to Andy Rooney : Molly Ivins , P. J. O'Rourke and Stanley Crouch , iconoclastic print journalists from various points on the political spectrum . Meanwhile , " 48 Hours , " which Mr. Heyward helped introduce as its executive producer in 1988 , is expanding coverage to include more than one story per episode . <p> As for " The CBS Evening News , " Mr. Heyward is credited with generally improving the broadcast over the last year . For that program , he is pursuing what he calls a " big-story , big-correspondent strategy , " in which he has emphasized more in-depth coverage  --  on the Unabomber , for instance  --  and given more air time to senior correqpondents like Bob Simon in the Middle East . He is also borrowing correspondents from " 60 Minutes " for special reports from time to time . In addition , Mr. Rather says , " he has insisted on an increased emphasis on the writing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalistically and the best of the three network news shows , " says Mr. Tyndall . But in spite of this overhaul , " Evening News " still lags behind ABC and NBC in the ratings . <p> " Obviously we want the ratings to improve , and I 'd like to see some improvement by year 's end , " says Mr. Heyward . " But ' Evening News ' ratings move at a glacial pace . " <p> A more radical change has been implemented at " CBS This Morning , " which this summep will switch to a new format combining network and local programming , with stations being given the freedom to mix bits of their own local morning programs with the national program . ( The program is also expected to replace its anchors , Harry Smith and Paula Zahn , though no one will say who is to take over . ) <p> Beyond tinkering with the programs , Mr. Heyward seems to have brought more forceful leadership to the news division . He is credited with helping bring about the eventual broadcast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Wigand in February , three months after the story was shelved . " He had a hand in that , " says Don Hewitt , executive producer of " 60 Minutes , " of a decision that was made by Mr. Heyward , key figures on " 60 Minutes " and CBS 's lawyers . <p> Though the risk of a lawsuit had lessened by the time the segment ran ( The Wall Street Journal had published transcripts of a deposition by Mr. Wigand ) , the broadcast was regarded as important within CBS . " This place was really down because of the tobacco story , " says Mr. Hewitt . " By going ahead with the story , it improved morale and got us moving forward again . " <p> More recently , Mr. Heyward made a tough call on the Unabomber story . He decided to hold back a CBS scoop on the suspect 's identity at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Then , after sitting on the story for a day , he told the agency he planned to hold it no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoop ( just barely ) , and the F.B.I . publicly praised the network for acting " in a memorably responsible manner . " <p> Mr. Heyward , who in sp'te of his rapid-fire speaking style manages to be meticulous about saying the right things , plays down his role in the " 60 Minutes " tobacco decision , saying : " I do n't want to come off as a hero . There were other people involved , too . " Similarly , he notes that some of the current changes in " 60 Minutes " and other programs were in the works before he became president . And he goes out of his way to defend Mr. Ober , who , he says , " deserves more credit than he 's gotten for bringing us intact through a very difficult period . " <p> Mr. Heyward 's smooth , politically cautious manner contrasts with the style of Mr. Ober , who was seen by some as combative . This difference , along with Mr. Heyward 's track record as a producer , has so far minimized friction between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implement changes . Mr. Ober had risen on the management side of the news division . " Andrew 's one of us , " says Mr. Fager . Mr. Rather adds , " It makes a difference that he comes from the editorial side . " <p> A graduate of Harvard , Mr. Heyward considered going to law school but ended up working in a low-level job at Channel 5 in New York . Two years later , at the age of 23 , he was producing a news program . Mr. Heyward became a producer at " The CBS Evening News " in 1984 , then left the program to introduce " 48 Hours " and " Eye to Eye With Connie Chung . " <p> He rejoined Mr. Rather in 1994 , as the executive producer of " Evening News " and was involved in the decision a year ago to remove Ms. Chung from the anchor desk . " It was hard for me because Connie is a friend , " he says . " But it was an experiment that did n't work , and the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his background as a producer makes it natural for him to take part in adjusting programs , there is a potential down side to this . " It could be said that I have a vested interest in the status quo , " he says . " There are people here I 've worked for , people I feel loyal to . " <p> Mr. Rather , who has worked alongside Mr. Heyward for years , says the new president has not had trouble adjusting to the role of boss . " When he has to impose discipline or exercise command , he 's able to do it , " he says . <p> The ascension of Mr. Heyward , along with that of Andrew Lack , the president of NBC News , and Roone Arledge , the head of ABC News , " is a changing of the guard , with producers taking over and bringing network news into the modern age , " says Mr. McClellan of Broadcasting and Cable . <p> Mr. Heyward concurs . " I think it 's no accident that all three network news divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by producers , " he says . With the greater availability of quality news coverage on cable and local networks , he says , " network news must find ways to provide something distinctive in terms of programs , rather than just presiding over news coverage . " <p> Mr. Heyward must also find a way to attract talent . There are no clear successors for older CBS stars like Mike Wallace , who is 76 years old , and Mr. Rather , 64 . There has been talk in the industry that CBS News may try to hire a major star , like Diane Sawyer or Bryant Gumbel . <p> MR . HEYWARD IS COY on this question . " We 've met with all the agents , " he says . " If we have the chance to acquire a major name , we will . " <p> But with no cable outlets and just two prime-time news programs it wo n't be easy . The extent to which he succeeds in attracting talent and developing new programs will depend , in part , on how much support Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose it 's possible Westinghouse will quail at the cost of running a news division , " he says , " but so far they 've said and done all the right things . " <p> " I do n't want to be naively optimistic , " he adds , " but I think people sense that we have an opportunity to get moving . " <p> Stanley Crouch of " 60 Minutes . " ( China Jorrin/CBS ) ; P.
