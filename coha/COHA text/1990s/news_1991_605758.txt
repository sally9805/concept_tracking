<p> The Warren Beatty charm technique , as described by some who have experienced it , goes something like this : He relates flattering information specific to you . He has noticed your work ( he is fond of actresses ) , in intelligent detail , mentioning subtle touches that you thought no one had noticed , or noting how different you are from your competitors , and how much better . This , it would seem , is a man who truly appreciates you as an individual , an artist , a thoughtful person , not just another bimbo . He wants to talk about you , he 's fascinated by what you have to say , he laughs at your jokes . <p> It is only later that you hear from other women just how flattered they were too . <p> But that was the old Warren Beatty . The playboy . The guy who could n't commit to dinner , as his sister ( actress Shirley MacLaine ) once cracked . The new Warren Beatty is about to learn how to change a diaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splat of baby spit-up on the magnificent gray cashmere-covered shoulder of the man in this hotel suite ; difficult to visualize a car seat in the back of that black Mercedes sports car parked out front . It 's impossible to resist thoughts of Mr. Charm being humbled by a 2-year-old lying down in the middle of the street , screaming because she has n't been allowed to run into traffic . Or a 4-year-old demanding that he move the sun because it 's shining in her eyes . Or , better yet , a 15-year-old telling him to please disappear when her friends come over because he 's such a dork ... <p> But he 's ready . At 54 , he says the time has come to make the big commitment  --  if not to marriage , to children . And Lord knows , you ca n't divorce kids . He 's delighted , he 's learning Lamaze , and thank you very much , that 's all you 're going to hear on that subject right now . <p> " Is it three weeks , dear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks ago . She said she thought so . <p> So , let 's give the guy some credit . At a point where he was on the verge of becoming ridiculous , an aging rouei , a figure of fun , he has redeemed himself by embracing fatherhood . In the way these things work in the public psyche , a man who is no longer seen as personally evanescent can be taken more seriously as an artist . " Dick Tracy " disappointed fans partly because the image of Beatty running around with Madonna was a joke , a parody of all the tabloid romances that ever were . The movie preceding that was " Ishtar . " <p> As it happens , " Bugsy "  --  the film that has motivated him to give so many interviews lately  --  has sophistication , wit , characters , plot , great reproduction of the 1940s , and the critics are loving it . Beatty may win another Oscar or two ( he 'd be eligible as actor and producer ) , and has already gotten a Best Picture award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatty accomplishes the difficult job of making Jewish gangster Benjamin " Bugsy " Siegel appealing enough that you want to watch a movie about him , without hiding the fact that the man is a psychopath . <p> There are other reasons to give Beatty credit . He has used his early power as a box office heartthrob , and his profits from 1967 's " Bonnie and Clyde , " to carve a career that is pretty respectable . There have been only 19 films in 30 years , but cumulatively they have earned 44 Academy Award nominations , 11 of them for him . He produced  --  that means a high degree of control as well as responsibility  --  " Bonnie and Clyde , " " Shampoo , " " Heaven Can Wait , " " Reds " and " Dick Tracy . " The last two he also directed , winning an Oscar for " Reds . " <p> As an actor , he has a fairly narrow range . But if you look at the other things he 's done  --  including taking time off from Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to admit : The guy must be more than a skirt chaser . <p> For 12 years , Beatty did not give interviews . " ... It 's fundamentally destructive to the ability to look at a movie and have your own feelings about it , because it 's obliterated by all this chatter that comes from us about our work , and  --  I always say it 's like somebody coming into a kitchen where there is a 7,000-pound souffle , and stamping their foot . It 's just too hot . ... Shut up ! Do n't talk about the movie , just show the movie and go quietly into the night and hope they like it . ... I felt ' Reds ' needed to be perceived on its own merits , and I did n't give an interview on that at all . I could have talked like hell about that movie if I wanted to . And of course I wanted to . I wanted to pontificate and expound , and sound smart . But I did n't do it , to my credit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , he said , stuff gets printed anyway . Also , it is  --  however regrettable  --  the nature of the business . While he views celebrity news as " the last non-drug palliative for depression , " he decided that he might as well go along with the process and try to guide it somehow . <p> The Publicity Machine <p> The press kit for " Bugsy " included a copy of the script , a copy of Time magazine with " One Nation Under God " on the cover and a favorable review inside , a 24-page , full-color , souvenir photo brochure , a copy of Premiere magazine with Beatty and Bening on the cover , a cassette of the soundtrack and , for some , a black sweatshirt . A white bag with handles was thoughtfully provided to lug it all around . <p> On the morning after a screening , which was followed by a party in a bar near the theater , approximately 60 reporters gathered in a ballroom of the Century Plaza Tower Hotel ( Ronald Reagan 's favorite when he visited L.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed around the large room . Breakfast was provided . <p> Most of the reporters had been flown to Los Angeles and put up at TriStar Productions ' expense for a two-movie , five-day publicity blitz . A form to put in for " incidental expenses " had been included in the press kit for " Hook , " which had been the focus earlier in the week . The press was assembled now for the " print round robins " for " Bugsy , " which meant that at 20-minute intervals someone came to your table to be interviewed by seven or eight people at once  --  actors Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley in addition to Beatty and Bening , who met when he was considering her for the movie , director Barry Levinson , scriptwriter James Toback , executive producer Mark Johnson . <p> Later in the day , the television reporters , also flown in at studio expense , would have their turn . A makeup artist was provided by the studio , and so were the cameras . Every shot was the same , the lighting provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best . Meanwhile , two-minute clips from the movie played ceaselessly in the 29th-floor press suite . When a reporter  --  fearing the possibility of madness or brainwashing  --  asked if they could be turned off for a while , she was politely shown to an empty room , where she could entertain her seditious thoughts in solitude and exile . <p> But this is just the meat grinder end of the great publicity machinery . Earlier , months before the movie 's release , the magazine drums started pounding the news of " Bugsy . " Beatty was on the cover of Vanity Fair , which frequently allows movie stars to approve the cover photo . In Beatty 's case the magazine brought out its big guns and flew Norman Mailer to California to interview him . <p> Other " exclusives " are strategically timed . A reporter from the New York Times ( which , like The Washington Post and other major papers , does not accept freebie junkets ) got driven around by Beatty and taken to his home , and produced an enormous story that dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premiere magazine got Warren and Annette for the cover , and obliged with two admiring pieces , one written by Toback . USA Weekend also got to go to the Beatty-designed manse on Mulholland Drive , and produced a cover story . <p> The Washington Post was asked for assurance that this story would appear on the front of the Style section , if Beatty submitted to a one-hour interview . The pictures are provided by the studio 's publicity office at its insistence . <p> Manipulation ? Or just business as usual , transactions of mutual advantage ? <p> It was suggested to Beatty that the White House and the Pentagon would be delighted to know how to exert as much power over the press as the so-called Hollywood liberals seem to be able to do . <p> He looked momentarily baffled and said he did n't understand . " When you say control , I do n't know what you 're talking about . There 's nobody here , you have the tape recorder . ... Manipulate ? Not by me , kid . " <p> The press and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : marketing . On this subject he delivered a truly energized peroration . <p> " It 's what happens in this pursuit of money . And I do n't blame it on Reagan , I believe Reagan was a manifestation of it . ... I believe that the pursuit of these vast amounts of money that can be earned with the accurate study of demographics by definition causes us to go for the middle , for the median line , for the mediocre . Mediocre 's not bad , it 's medium , it 's in the middle . ... <p> " How much can you say about a picture you 've seen 7 billion times ? How much can you say about some mediocre thing ? So of course the only thing left to talk about is how many hamburgers you 've sold , and the second and the third and the fourth . And then you read the paper , and you do n't have much time , and you do n't have much interest in it . Because not much interesting is happening , so you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at a cocktail party at the Watergate or something and what do you talk about ? Popular hamburgers . You would n't have a clue there are some pepper steaks somewhere , or steak Diane , or some sort of tartare steak that could be even possible . " <p> That 's how he talks . <p> He also suggested that information about the business end of movie making  --  the costs , the profits , the salaries  --  should be reported in the financial section of a newspaper , rather than " the cultural pages . " Some might find that idea as baffling as he found the notion of manipulation . <p> Bening and ' Bugsy ' <p> Bening and Beatty arrived in the press ballroom together , about a half-hour late . She was wearing brown tights , a brown velvet overblouse and a plaid tan jacket . She was quite pregnant , but not heavy . There were no diamonds on her fingers , only semiprecious stones . She is on the cover of Cosmopolitan this month . Fully clothed in red sequins . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her best yet , although her role as a charming and desperately amoral con woman in " The Grifters " signaled her entrance into the big time . Hill , a Hollywood bit player , was wildly promiscuous , conducting relationships on her own terms . She becomes , in the movie , the woman the philandering Siegel is obsessed with , the one woman who curbs ( slightly ) his manic foraging through life . With her at his side , he dreams the big dream : building Las Vegas out of a desert . <p> " Their love did ennoble them in some crazy way , " Bening said . At 33 , she comes across as smart , protective , and nobody 's fool . She managed , in her 20 minutes , to sound very articulate and thoughtful , while basically revealing nothing about herself . <p> Virginia Hill , she noted , went on to become a money courier , probably involved in drugs , and was wanted for tax evasion . She moved to Austria , married an Olympic skier who was said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , without leaving a note but holding a romantic tract called " Forever " in her hand . <p> Bening and Beatty hope to work together again , she said , but they do n't have anything specific in mind . <p> Philosophy and Fatherhood <p> The interview with Beatty started to get gloomy . He ate plain turkey breast and raw vegetables , and drank caffeine-free cola . He looked well , although the makeup that had been plastered on his face with a shovel for the earlier television interviews gave him a disconcerting , marzipan-like glow . His hair was once streaked with gray ; it is no longer . It still stands up in that square , God-given fullness that must have helped make him the high school hero he was at Arlington 's Washington and Lee in the early 1950s . That was when Arlington was still a modest Virginia suburb . The schools were still segregated then , and Tysons Corner was in the country . <p> As a student of politics , and an unrepentant liberal , Beatty said he saw little reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 're experiencing some kind of lull before the storm , " he said , not willing to call the storm a full-fledged depression . " After that storm we will have to wake up and approach things in a much more creative and social way , and that we 'll be happier for it . " <p> What would he do , he was asked , should this small-d depression cause him to find himself without a job or money ? <p> " I 'd go out and try to make some money . " <p> What if there were no jobs ? <p> " You mean other than act in movies ? ... You mean how do I believe I would respond ? You know I do n't view money  --  Bugsy says it well in the movie  --  ' it 's only dirty paper . ' And there 's something not crazy about that . And I , just as you want to live each day with some cognizance of your own mortality , I think it 's not a dumb idea to live each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we being practical or philosophical here ? How I would get a job or how unhappy I would be ? <p> " I 'd be unhappy . " He laughed . " ... I think I am a resourceful person and I think I would try to get it together and cope with it . I do n't know how well I 'd do . I 'd be very energetic about it . Now that I 'm having a daughter . "
