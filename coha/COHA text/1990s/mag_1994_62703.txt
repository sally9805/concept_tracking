Last Thursday the man of the moment was on his way to make the news of the moment in Aspen , Colo.  --  " news , " in this case , being loosely defined as anything that might happen to tumble out of his mouth . In order to be the first to record the exact moment of the man 's arrival , a television news crew had positioned itself in a corridor at the bottom of a staircase in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel . A camera was set up , the stairs were studied for any sign of the man , and the vigil commenced . // The newshounds were still poised there when Tommy Moe , last month 's American gold medal winner in the Olympic downhill and silver medal winner in the Super G , slouched by , wearing jeans , a T-shirt and a baseball cap . No one on the stakeout team moved , and inasmuch as not one of them had the slightest idea what this newly minted American hero looked like , not a frame of film was shot as Moe shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Diane Tegmeyer , the chief press officer for the World Cup downhill races that were to be run on Aspen Mountain over the following two days , spoke up . " I ran up to them all exasperated , " Tegmeyer says , " and I go , ' Uh , guys , I think you missed him . ' " // The stakeout was just one more manifestation of the Moe-mania that held Aspen in its grip last week . From the Silver City Grille , where a Moe Burger ( made of turkey , of all things ) was a brisk seller at $6.50 , to the bar at the Hotel Jerome , all of Aspen resonated like a rock opera with the sound of Moe 's name : " Tommy ! Tommy ! Tommy , can you hear me ! " // He signed shirts , American flags , skis , and on Friday afternoon , after finishing 55th in that morning 's race  --  ahead of only seven other racers , including skiers from those Alpine hot spots Senegal and Puerto Rico  --  he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's downhill team . At least a thousand people , many of them women in fur pelts and stretch pants trying very hard to look blas ? , lined up for a look . " It 's kind of overwhelming coming back to the U.S. and all of a sudden being kind of a hero , " Moe said . " It 's kind of tough , you know ? From being a guy who nobody bothered with , to instant stardom , but I 'm all for it . I 'm going to make a lot of money . " // Moe 's popularity is the result of personality and timing , says former U.S. Ski Team coach and TV analyst Bob Beattie . " He came around when America really wanted to see a winner . And not only a winner but a guy that every father could say , ' I 'd like to have him as my son . ' I 've had so many kids come up and say that he 's somebody that you can relate to . " // Moe had hoped to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get , " he said , but presumably not embarrass himself after all the post-Olympic celebrating . Last Friday 's race was a makeup for an event that had been canceled in February . Moe 's dreadful 55th-place finish came on skis that he first said had a badly beveled edge and later said were peeling on the top side . " It was like skiing on spoons , " he said after finishing 3.26 seconds behind winner Hannes Trinkl of Austria . " It seemed like my skis were walking away from me . But it 's no big deal . Today 's just another race . I 've already had my great result this season . It 's kind of hard to get back up after what happened to me the last couple of weeks . " // In Saturday morning 's race he wound up 20th , and as he came stumbling down the mountain , you could hear groans from the crowd every time one of his intermediate times was announced . " I did n't have the strength to hold the turns , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // When someone asked Moe if he thought people might conclude from his performances in Aspen that he was a flash in the pan and his Olympic win had been a fluke , he became livid . " Did you say I was a flash in the pan , buddy ? " he said . " I 'm not a flash in the pan . I just won the Olympics . " // A moment later the anger was gone , and Moe seemed depressed that he had let down his American supporters . " It 's kind of disappointing for them , " he said , " and it 's kind of embarrassing for me not to do as well as I wanted to . I 'm just tired . " // If the man of the moment had n't known when he arrived in Aspen how difficult it can be to make the moment last , he knew now . " It 's definitely sunk in , " Moe said . " I feel like I 'm getting yanked in all different directions by people wanting little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm having a good time . I 'm more than happy to be in the spotlight . If I was n't , I would n't be as happy as I am now . " Then , as if to remind himself that , hey , he had won the gold medal , Moe said hopefully , " I do n't really have any pressure on me . Just what I put on myself . " // Depending on how he handles it , that could be enough .
