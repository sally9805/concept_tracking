Strange tales filtered out of the 78-acre compound of the Branch Davidian cult near Waco , Texas , but reports of possible mass suicide spurred a surprise assault on Sunday by the Treasury Department 's Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . Prepared , cult members killed four feds and wounded 16 . During the ensuing week of siege , leader David Koresh got radio time but reneged on his promise to surrender afterward . Of 140 in the compound , he allowed 23 to leave ; they had reportedly seen 10 dead inside . ATF and FBI agents prepared for a long stakeout : the Davidians are said to have massive stocks of food .
