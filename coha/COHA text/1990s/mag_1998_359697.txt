Chaplain Mark Weiler is holding a seashell filled with purified water . Normally it 's the parents who ask for him , when they want their baby baptized and do n't think they can afford to wait . But this baby was abandoned weeks ago , and is due to go into surgery in an hour ; it was the nurses who called and put aside their work to gather around the incubator . Weiler ca n't pick up this child , lying so still , like a broken marionette , so much tape holding so many tubes . He dips his finger in the water and touches the baby 's forehead . " I baptize you , Christopher , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit . " And they say a prayer . <P> Christopher is six weeks old , and had been doing fine . His mother was a coke addict ; he was born at 24 weeks , weighing about 1 1/2 lbs. , but once he was stabilized , he came off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1972 , a 2-lb. baby had a 95% chance of dying , " says Dr. Ronald Goldberg , chief of the neonatal-intensive-care unit . " If he lived , the damage was pretty severe . Now a 2-lb. baby has a 95% chance of surviving , and the outcomes we 're seeing are very good . " <P> After a few weeks in the NICU , Christopher even got moved down the hall to the transitional nursery . Then on Sunday morning he started looking sick : his belly was swelling ; he showed signs of a massive infection ; and he was sent back to the intensive-care unit . <P> Dr. Henry Rice operated at about 3 a.m . Monday , and what he saw was n't good . " Maybe 95% of the bowel looked questionable , " he says . " Sometimes you can remove the bad part , and he can fight off the infection . But this child 's whole gut was involved . " They stabilized him , able only to watch him over the next few hours , hoping for some improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the baby 's intestines were viable , the doctors could keep him alive long enough to perform a bowel transplant that might save his life . Here , however , the doctor 's dilemma is ethical as much as medical . Is it fair to set out on a course of treatment that would involve enormous risk and pain , a year in the hospital at least and a very difficult life thereafter ? " Just because you can do something does n't mean you should , " explains Dr. Goldberg . " We have to keep a level head and treat the child as if it were your own . What would you want for your own kid ? " <P> And if the doctors got over that hurdle , there is the fact that it would all cost about $1 million , most of which Duke would pay out of its pocket . Christopher 's medical care has already cost $192,500 , of which Medicaid will reimburse only about $81,000 . When money is tight , research crucial and hard to pay for , and there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources ? <P> The doctors never give up , and at 10:45 a.m. , Dr. Rice operates again . This time the news is even worse , and all options are foreclosed . " He essentially had no intestine beyond the stomach , " says Dr. Rice . " Doing anything more at this point would just be futile therapy . " All they could do was increase the morphine , ease the pain .
