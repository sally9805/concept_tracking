When an ankle takes a turn for the worse , RICE and tape are just what the doctor ordered . BY BUCK TILTON // Here 's one you can probably relate to : The sun 's about to set and you 're scrambling for the best seat to catch the show . Exhilarated by the impending beauty , you run , you leap , you crash . Tweak goes the ankle . As the sky fills with hues of pink and orange , your ankle turns shades of blue and purple . The pain is so bad you can barely limp back to camp . Or maybe you 're crossing a stream and slip on a rock or encounter a big root across the trail or are n't paying attention on a downhill switchbackthere are so many ways to harm the joint that connects foot to leg that ankle sprains account for almost 53 percent of injury-related evacuations from National Outdoor Leadership School ( NOLS ) courses . The good news is that most sprains can be managed in the field . Even better is the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANATOMY OF A SPRAIN The two big bones in your lower leg , the tibia and fibula , meet your ankle at the talus bone , which sits atop the calcaneus , or heel bone . A complex arrangement of ligaments holds it all together , and under normal conditions the ankle can withstand some eversion ( turning outward ) and inversion ( turning inward ) . When an ankle goes too far one way or the other , a sprain results . In severe cases-during a leap , or when plunging downhill under a load , for instancethe tib and fib can be forced apart and ligaments are torn , which causes excruciating pain . Whether you 're the injured one or you 're trying to help someone else with a bum ankle . assessing severity is relatively simple . Which way did the ankle twist ? Was there force involved ? Was there a " popping " or " snapping " sound ? Has the ankle been injured before ? Now study the ankle . Is there swelling or discoloration ? How much ? Is there pain when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenderness means injury . Carefully move the ankle through its range of motion . Again , is there pain ? As with most traumatic injuries , ankle sprains have three levels : * 1 first-degree injury , the most common type , occurs when ligaments stretch but do n't actually tear . Moving your foot and the damaged ligaments causes pain , but there 's little swelling , bruising , or instability . With proper care and taping ( see " Stick To It , " page 26 ) you can keep hiking and will be back to normal in one to two weeks . * 1ith a second-degree injury , partially torn ligaments quickly swell and cause bruising . The pain may discourage you from moving your foot , and complete healing can take as long as six weeks . A moderately injured ankle can also be taped , but only so the person can limp back to the trailhead , with most of the weight from his backpack distributed among other group members . Walking will be difficult but tolerable . Third-degree injuries involve complete ligament tears . Bruising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't be able to move your foot because of the intense pain and swelling . An ankle that 's injured this severely can be confused easily with one that 's broken ( symptoms can include a " pop " or " snap " when the injury occurred , persistent intense pain , tenderness when touched , and an obvious deformity ) . Whether it 's a third-degree sprain or a break , the injury requires splinting and immediate medical attention . Third-degree sprains can take six months or longer to completely heal , and 10 to 15 percent of those afflicted may require rehabilitative surgery . To reduce pain and swelling , all ankle injuries should initially be managed with RICE : REST the injury ; in other words , make the person get off his feet . ICE the ankle ; cool it with packed snow , soak it in a cold mountain stream , or wrap it in a wet T-shirt . COMPRESS the injury with an elastic wrap ( if available ) to reduce swelling , working from the toes toward the heart . Never wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses feeling in the toes . ELEVATE ; prop the leg up higher than the person 's heart . Maintain RICE for 20 to 30 minutes , then allow the injured ankle to rewarm for 12 to 15 minutes before letting the person try to use it . RICE may be repeated every 2 to 4 hours for the first 24 hours . Over the next 48 hours you 'll want to maintain compression and apply ice three to four times a day . Doctors typically recommend an **29;709;TOOLONG drug , such as ibuprofen , for sprains and tendonitis ( see " Tendon Trouble , " below ) . To help speed recovery most physicians now recommend that patients use a sprained ankle as soon as possible , depending on the severity of the injury . It may be a day or two , however , before the person is willing to walk very far , and of course , the injured person is the one who should ultimately determine if an ankle is usable . If you prefer the preventative approach , there are several things you can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to prevent injury is to get in shape by running , cycling , and swimmingpreferably with fins-to help strengthen ankles . * 1ose weight : Excess pounds put stress on your ankles . * 1ear good boots : Choose stiff footwear that provides adequate ankle support , and replace soft , worn-out boots . * 1arm up muscles : Before shouldering a pack , put your hands on a tree and lean against it with one leg forward , one leg back . Lock the back knee , and flex the front knee . Press forward until you feel a stretch in the calf muscle ( it attaches to the Achilles tendon ) of your back leg . Now keep both heels on the ground and bend both knees until you feel more stretching in the lower leg muscles . Hold for 15 to 30 seconds . Repeat with your other leg back . Walk around packless to warm up all leg muscles . * 1earn from the past : If you 've suffered a prior ankle injury , follow the first four suggestions even more aggressively . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hike after dark , and always watch where you place your feet when hiking . TENDON TROUBLE When your feet and ankles move , so do the lower leg muscles and tendons , which are the fibrous tissues connecting muscle to bone . If you 're not in the best shape and try to hike too far too soon , inflammation of tendons can result . Tendonitis can range from discomfort to debilitation , depending on the degree of inflammation . Achilles tendonitis can occur after a long hike , especially when significant elevation gain is involved , because the lower the heel is in relation to the toes , the greater the stress on the Achilles . Your boots can also be the cause . An inward fold above the heel counter can irritate the Achilles enough to cause tendonitis after just one day of backpacking . Broken down or poor-quality boots that allow too much motion and not enough support may lead to pain and inflammation . Similarly . footwear that 's too stiff or too tightly laced can result in tendonitis at the front of the ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve stress on the Achilles . A strip of padding-small pieces of a closed-cell foam sleeping pad or folded gauze will do-taped on each side of the Achilles will further reduce stress . As a general rule , placing padding on both sides of any injured tendon will reduce stress and discomfort .
