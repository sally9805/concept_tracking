Let 's take a vacation and close up our workshops . We need a change to fit us for school in the fall . Vacation suggests good times outdoors , and camping is one of the best of good times . We generally think of camping as sleeping in a tent in the woods or on the banks of a lake or stream or motor camping with Daddy . But not all of us can go away this summer , so I shall tell how to camp out in the backyard or in a vacant lot nearby , a plan anyone can follow . Make sure to get permission first . Of course , backyard camping keeps you close to home . But when you awaken in the dead of night , it does not require a great deal of imagination to fancy that you are in deep woods a thousand miles away . Camping at home is packs of fun , and you probably will want to sleep out all summer , once you have become accustomed to it . The backyard camp is a good training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking a tent , building a cooking fire , and cooking food fit to eat . And it is an advantage to the tenderfoot to have home near at hand in case things go wrong , in case the tent leaks like a sieve or blows away , the eats do n't fill the hungry spot , or the mosquito repellent fails to work properly . Figure 1 shows the way I would organize my backyard camp . Almost any type of tent will do , but the small pup tent , or shelter tent , is quite the thing for the backyard camp because it requires little space . It is an inexpensive tent , too . When you become a Scout , you will use it frequently on overnight hikes . The illustration shows a tent made of a tarpaulin , or several widths of eight-ounce cotton duck fabric sewed together , with a triangular piece to enclose the rear , and a similar piece to protect the front . If you will support one end of the ridgepole upon the fence rail , as shown , only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides to fasten the tent to . Keep the tent taut in dry weather , but slacken it before a storm to prevent its ripping when rained upon . To keep surface water from flooding the tent , dig a narrow trench around it , with an outlet at one side for a drain . Spread an old rug , piece of carpet , or burlap upon the ground , and place a poncho or raincoat upon it before making your bed . Ask Mother to sew up a mattress sack of unbleached muslin , three feet wide and five feet long , with one end left open . Straw is the best filling , but dried grass will do . After filling the sack , fasten the open end with safety pins . The backyard campfire is used only for cooking ; therefore , it is small , and not dangerous . But scrape away the grass from the spot on which the fire is to be built , or place a piece of sheet iron upon the grass . Gather dry tree branches or shrubbery cuttings for starting your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting , which are twice as many as should be necessary . With your knife make a small pile of whittlings . Then enclose the pile with short pieces of branches placed wigwam fashion , as shown in Figure 2 , and all will be laid for lighting . Light a match , shield it from the wind with one hand , and when the match stick is burning brightly , slip it between the sticks and ignite the small shavings . Shield the windward side of the wood with hand or hat until the fire has got a good start , and then feed with other pieces of branches and heavier wood . Figure 3 shows how to whittle a " fuzz stick " by raising shavings upon all surfaces of a stick . Such a stick is of great help in starting a fire in windy weather , as it kindles readily . A second-class Scout is required to know how to cook meat and potatoes without cooking utensils . Figure 4 shows the stick method of supporting a wienie over the fire . Select a green stick with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Build a fireplace , like that shown in Figure 1 , for the support of cooking utensils . Dig up pieces of grass and sod to form a fire pit four inches wide at one end and twelve inches wide at the other end , and place the sod pieces , dirt side up , at the sides of the pit . The narrow end of this fireplace will support a frying pan . Iron bars or lengths of pipe may be placed across the wide end to support pots and kettles , or a crane , shown in the illustration , may be used . Make the crane uprights forked , as shown in Figure 5 , and place a broom handle or curtain pole in the forks for the supporting pole . Then bend Sshaped hooks out of heavy wire , and interlock them , as shown in Figure 1 , to support the kettle at the desired distance above the fire . A flashlight is handy in camp , but you must have a lantern for continuous lighting . The candle lantern shown in Figure 6 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the side . Use a nail and hammer , as shown in Figure 7 . Then insert a candle and attach a wire handle . The illustration shows how to set up a camp table , cupboard , and box seats .
