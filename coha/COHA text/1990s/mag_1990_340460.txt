If there was one social program that congressional Democrats could exploit as a campaign rallying cry , it was child care . With elections looming this fall , they should have been in a position to trumpet their efforts to help working mothers , 75% of whom tell pollsters that they are unable to find adequate care for their children while they are on the job . Instead , House Democrats have allowed the first nationwide child-care system to become mired in committee turf battles for six months . As Olympia Snowe , a Maine Republican , tartly observed last week , " If this bill were an actual child , Congress long ago would have been found guilty of abuse and neglect . " <P> On one side of the impasse was Congressman Thomas Downey of New York , who wanted to pay for expanded day-care services through existing block grants to the states , which are less subject to Congress 's political whims . On the other side was Congressman Augustus Hawkins of California , who wanted the Federal Government to give the money directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will retire from Congress this year after serving 14 terms , would like to be remembered for his work on a major new social program . <P> Last week , after beating back a White House-supported effort to further water down the Democrats ' approach , Congress finally settled on a plan . Members voted 265 to 145 to establish a system that will provide $27 billion over five years to poor parents through income-tax credits and direct subsidies . The bill requires states to set health standards at day-care centers , expands Head Start programs for poor children and provides school- based care for up to 10 million so-called latchkey kids who would otherwise go unattended after school . In a compromise with conservatives , Democrats agreed to require states to issue vouchers that parents can use to pay for child care even at centers operated by religious institutions . <P> The bill will now go to a House-Senate conference committee , where it will again be rewritten before being sent on to the White House . There it may fare no better than a child-care program that Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the program and federal standards for child-care ( centers , a senior Bush Administration official pronounced the bill a " monstrosity " and promised a veto . There will be more partisan bickering while the urgent needs of parents and children go unmet .
