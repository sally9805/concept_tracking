Summary <p> Background Neuroblastoma has many characteristics which suggest that preclinical detection might improve outcome . The Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project was initiated to determine whether mass screening could reduce mortality in a large cohort of infants . As an early endpoint , we report whether screening could reduce the incidence of poor-prognosis neuroblastoma in children with advanced-stage disease over 1 year of age . <p> Methods All 476603 children born in the province of Quebec during the 5-year period of May 1 , 1989 , to April 30 , 1994 , were eligible for urinary assay of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid at 3 weeks and 6 months of age . Children with a positive screen were referred to one of four paediatric cancer centres in the province for uniform evaluation and treatment if necessary . Standardised incidence ratios ( SIRs ) were calculated for neuroblastoma in the province and two similar population-based controls , the state of Minnesota and the province of Ontario , during the same period of time and with similar ascertainment procedures . <p> Findings Compliance with screening in Quebec province was 91% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ( n=349706 ) . Through July 31 , 1995 , with a follow-up of the birth cohort of 15-75 months , 118 cases of neuroblastoma were diagnosed , 43 detected preclinically by screening , 20 detected clinically before screening at 3 weeks of age , and 55 detected clinically after 3 weeks of age having normal screens ( 52 ) or never screened ( 3 ) . Retrospective analysis of stored samples confirmed that 49 of 52 patients missed by screening had levels of catecholamine metabolites that were too low to be detected at 6 months or earlier . Based on US Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results data , 54.5 cases of neuroblastoma would have been expected in Quebec province during the study period , for an SIR of 2.17 ( 95% CI 1.79-2.57 , p&lt;0.0001 ) . For the two control groups , 43 and 80 cases of neuroblastoma were detected , respectively , compared with 37.9 and 85.4 expected , overall SIR 1.00 ( not significant ) . SIRs for Quebec province by age at diagnosis in yearly intervals show a marked increased incidence under 1 year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reduction in incidence in subsequent years . Limiting analysis to only patients diagnosed over 1 year of age with advanced-stage disease , 22 cases were detected in Quebec province versus 14.4 expected ( SIR 1.52 , 0.95-2.23 ) . Data in the two control groups show no significant increase or decrease in any-stage disease in children under or over the age of 1 year , except for an increase in early-stage disease in Minnesota children over 1 year : 10 versus 3.8 expected ( SIR 2.67 , 1.27-4.58 ) . <p> Interpretation Screening for neuroblastoma increases the incidence in infants without decreasing the incidence of unfavourable advanced-stage disease in older children . It is unlikely that screening for neuroblastoma in infants will reduce mortality for this disease <p> Lancet 1996 ; 348 : 1682-87 <p> See Commentary page 1672 Introduction <p> Neuroblastoma is the most common solid tumour of children aged under 5 , cumulatively affecting about one in 7000 individuals. 1 , 2 Despite major advances in the treatment of other childhood cancers , the overall outcome for neuroblastoma has not changed in the past 15-20 years. 2 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catecholamine metabolites has been pioneered by several Japanese investigators , who documented that neuroblastoma can be diagnosed preclinically with almost uniformly favourable survival. 3 , 4 Neuroblastoma screening was instituted nationwide in Japan in 1985 . However , several methodological limitations , including lack of well-documented and well-controlled population-based studies with adequate ascertainment , preclude a conclusion that preclinical detection of this disease will reduce mortality. 5 , 6 The Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project was started to determine whether screening a large birth cohort of infants for neuroblastoma could reduce population-based incidence of advanced disease or mortality . With use of the infrastructure of the Quebec Network for Genetic Medicine , 7 screening for neuroblastoma was instituted in a 5-year birth cohort . Province-wide incidence and mortality results are being compared to several population-based control groups in North America in which infants were not offered screening. 8 Here we document whether neuroblastoma screening can reduce the incidence of unfavourable , advanced stage disease in older children . Methods <p> Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project <p> Specific aspects of the study design have been published. 8 , 9 Parents of infants born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 1989 , to April 30 , 1994 ) were offered , after informed consent , the opportunity to have urine samples from their infants tested at 3 weeks and 6 months of age for elevated catecholamine metabolites ( vanillylmandelic and homovanillic acids ) . Parents collected urine by blotting filter papers against wet diapers ( nappies ) , and drying and mailing them to the project in Sherbrooke . The first screen at 3 weeks of age was done on the sample used for screening for metabolic diseases , 9 with a compliance rate of 91% . The second screen at 6 months was a new test . Filter papers were provided to the parents at birth and multiple reminders were given ; 8 , 10 compliance with the second screen was 74% . <p> At the screening centre , thin-layer chromatography ( TLC ) for catecholamine metabolites was done. 8 , 9 Parents of infantswith insufficient or contaminated samples were contacted for repeat testing . Samples with borderline or positive TLC results ( figure 1 ) were sent to Minneapolis for **36;2716;TOOLONG ( GCMS ) assay. 8 Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers for GCMS . Patients with positive second analyses were referred to one of four Quebec province centres for evaluation. 8 Filter paper specimens from all children screened were frozen with appropriate controls for retrospective analyses from everypatient diagnosed with neuroblastoma and missed byscreening . <p> Ascertainment of neuroblastoma in Quebec <p> Children with neuroblastoma in Quebec province were ascertained by several methods. 2 Traditionally , over 90% of all patients with neuroblastoma diagnosed in this province have been referred to one of the four provincial paediatric cancer centres . Close contact was established between study investigators and Canadian medical centres outside the province where patients may have received care . <p> All Quebec province patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma underwent uniform staging by the Evans ' , Pediatric Oncology Group , and International Neuroblastoma Staging System ( INSS ) . 11 Four study investigators routinely reviewed each staging , with difficult cases staged by consensus . Samples for specific indices known to have prognostic importance in neuroblastoma , including N-myc gene copy-number , DNA ploidy , trk gene expression , serum ferritin , catecholamine metabolites , and histology , were collected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were subsequently treated based on age , stage , and biological features on specific protocols open during the study period ( Pediatric Oncology Group studies 8105 , 8741/2/3 , 8844 , 9140 , 9243/4 , 9248 , and 9340/1/2 ) . <p> Control groups <p> Two population-based non-screened control groups were followed up during the same 5-year period , with examination of neuroblastoma indices : ( 1 ) the state of Minnesota , with Children 's Cancer Group data and the population-based , pathology-based Cancer Surveillance System ; 12 and ( 2 ) the province of Ontario , because of the ability to ascertain cases through the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario 13 and its close proximity to Quebec province . Furthermore , the incidence and mortality of neuroblastoma in Quebec province was previously compared with data from the Greater Delaware Valley , the largest population-based paediatric tumour registry in North America , 14 for a 10-year period ( 1977-86 ) , with similar outcomes found ( incidence 11.3/10 6 per year in Quebec vs 10.6/10 6 per year in Delaware Valley ) . 2 All control patients were staged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Statistical and other analyses <p> To evaluate the occurrence of neuroblastoma within the study populations , the person-years of observation were compiled for subgroups defined by age . Using 1-year age-specific incidence rates from the US Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results ( SEER ) programme , 15 we calculated standardised incidence ratios ( SIRs ) and corresponding 95% CIs for Quebec , Minnesota , and Ontario. 16 SIRs were analysed according to Breslow and Day . SEER incidence rates for whites only ( overall 9.7/10 6 per year , similar to other worldwide rates among whites 17 ) were used , since greater than 95% of all three populations were white . Stage-specific incidence rates from the Delaware Valley paediatric tumour registry were used for calculation of SIRs within age-specific and stage-specific subgroups because SEER does not collect data on neuroblastoma staging . <p> Quebec , Minnesota , and Ontario patients were recorded as having neuroblastoma if they lived in the respective area when they were diagnosed with the disease and were born between May 1 , 1989 , and April 30 , 1994 , irrespective of place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Quebec province based on previous census data from the province , with only three cases of neuroblastoma expected to emigrate out and two additional cases expected by immigration during the study period ( G Dougherty , Montcare Children 's Hospital , McGill University , Montreal ) . In reality , three patients were diagnosed having emigrated from the area after birth ( two detected by screening , one never screened ) , and no patients were diagnosed while resident there , having been born elsewhere . These three patients were not included in the incidence analysis . <p> Staging was compared between Quebec , Minnesota , and Ontario based on concurrent ascertainment of cases , with data tabulated by the INSS . As an additional control , incidence of Evans ' early ( I , II , IVS ) and advanced ( III , IV ) disease in patients under and over the age of 1 was determined for the three study groups and compared with updated , previously acquired and reported Delaware Valley data , obtained at a time when only Evans ' staging was used. 2 Results <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , 1995 , with a follow-up of 15-75 months , there were 118 cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed among the Quebec province birth cohort ( figure 2 ) . 43 patients were detected preclinically , 17 at the 3-week screen and 26 at the 6-month screen . The patients referred to the four Quebec medical centres after positive screenings are shown in figure 1 . The selectivity of both the 3-week and 6-month screens was over 99.99% . The overall positive predictive value of the screening approach , including the repeat test , was 52% ( 43 of 82 ) . INSS neuroblastoma staging of Quebec province cases diagnosed through screening is summarised in table 1 . All patients detected by screening are alive and disease-free . <p> During the study period , 55 patients were detected clinically after 3 weeks of age , having been undetected by screening ( 52 ) or never screened ( 3 ) ( figure 3 ) . Only 3 patients in the entire cohort had positive tests by GCMS retrospective analysis of the 6-month samples . Two children were diagnosed at 7 and 8 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinicallyat 53 months with stage 4 neuroblastoma who , in retrospect , had an increased homovanillic acid at the6-month screen . Review of videotaped original TLC analysis confirmed a normal result , probably after submission of a dilute urine sample . All 49 otherchildren missed by screening could clearly not have been detected because their catecholamines were normal at screening . Overall sensitivity of the screening approach was 45% . <p> An additional 20 neuroblastoma patients were detected clinically before 3 weeks of age . All had raised vanillylmandelic acids and seven actually had urines submitted to the screening programme when they were detected clinically. 13 of the patients were found by routine neonatal examinations , one was detected as an incidental finding at surgery for other reasons , and six were detected by chest radiography or ultrasounds done for other reasons , including two performed prenatally . <p> Incidence of neuroblastoma in Quebec and control groups <p> Based on SEER data , 54.5 cases of neuroblastoma were expected to be diagnosed in Quebec province children born during the cohort period , with 118 cases observed thus far . The SIR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 and table 2 ) . Table 2 lists incidence data for this province and the two control groups . The SIR for the combined control groups is 1.00 with neither group showing statistically significant changes . <p> When we examined incidence by age at diagnosis in yearly intervals ( table 2 ) , the observed to expected ratio of cases diagnosed with neuroblastoma under 1 year of age in Quebec province was significantly higher than that expected ( SIR 2.85 , 95% CI 2.26-3.50 ) . For each of the subsequent yearly periods there was no significant decrease in incidence ( table 2 ) . Overall SIR for ages 1-6 was 1.42 ( 1.00-1.92 ) . No statistically significant increased or decreased incidences were seen in either Minnesota or Ontario for any of the six age-groups studied . <p> Neuroblastoma staging in the Quebec and control cohorts <p> INSS results are compared for Quebec , Minnesota , and Ontario groups in figure 4 . The numbers of patients in the control groups were " normalised " to the Quebec province population by comparing number of births for the 5-year cohorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 331425 , or 1.44 . The actual numbers of INSS stage 1 tumours in Minnesota was 11 . The number normalised to the Quebec population was 11x1.44 , or 15.8 . The number of Quebec province patients diagnosed with early-stage disease , especially stage 1 , was far in excess of that in the control groups . However , no concomitant decrease was noted in the more advanced stages 3 and 4 , as would have been expected had preclinical detection of neuroblastoma reduced the incidence of late-stage disease . In fact , the number of cases with stage 4 disease diagnosed in Quebec province ( 34 ) is much greater than that seen in the normalised control groups ( 25.9 and 15.9 in Minnesota and Ontario , respectively ) , with only a portion of the excess in Quebec diagnosed in children under 1 year by screening ( table 1 ) . <p> Finally , the SIRs of early and advanced Evans ' stage neuroblastoma in infants and older children were calculated with Greater Delaware Valley data ( table 3 ) . The SIR for Quebec province cohort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Minnesota and Ontario showing no significant increases or decreases ( table 3 ) . 45 advanced-stage cases were diagnosed during the study period in Quebec province , versus 26.0 expected ( SIR 1.73 , 1.26-2.28 ) . For the critical group with advanced-stage disease diagnosed over 1 year of age , no decrease was observed , with 22 Quebec cases detected versus 14.4 expected ( SIR 1.52 , 0.95-2.23 ) . By contrast , late advanced neuroblastoma incidence in the two control groups was similar to that in Quebec province . Furthermore , the occurrence of late advanced disease in Quebec before screening , both 1977-86 2 and 1987-89 ( overall 77 cases observed vs 49.9 expected , SIR 1.56 , 1.23-1.92 ) was identical to that observed in the screened population . Discussion <p> Neuroblastoma has several features that at first glance suggest that preclinical detection would reduce mortality . The disease has been hypothesised to be an embryonal neoplasm that presents with decreasing frequency from birth to age 5 . When infants are diagnosed with the disease , the tumour is often localised , exhibits favourable biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnosed in advanced or " special " ( 4S ) stage . On the other hand , children diagnosed over the age of 1 have a poor outcome , most presenting with widely disseminated disease and resistance to aggressive therapy , including bone-marrow transplantation. 18 Catecholamine metabolites are excreted in the urine of children with neuroblastoma and easily detected. 8 , 9 Unfortunately , the overall outcome for neuroblastoma has lagged behind that of other common paediatric neoplasms. 2 , 18 <p> Introduction of screening in Quebec province profoundly changed the natural history of the disease , resulting in more than a two-fold increase in incidence . The increase was largest for infants aged under 1 year . Even if we ignore the 3-week screen , the incidence of neuroblastoma in the Quebec cohort was dramatically increased . This would have been desirable had the incidence of neuroblastoma decreased in older children , but such was not the case . SIRs from 1 to 6 years showed an increase in the incidence , with no decreases noted in advanced disease at any age , overall disease in children over 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prognosis can be expected to be poor ( tables 2 and 3 , figures 2 and 4 ) . Although we can not say that neuroblastoma screening may not help an occasional patient , such as the one child missed by screening who was diagnosed with stage 4 disease at 53 months , the confidence intervals we calculated suggest that at most a 5% reduction in older poor-prognosis neuroblastoma could be detected ( table 3 ) . Overall changes noted in Quebec province were not seen in the two concurrent population-based control cohorts , Minnesota and Ontario , which has similar neuroblastoma ascertainment procedures and staging review . The incidence ratios for late-stage disease at over 1 year of age were elevated in Quebec before and after screening was initiated . Similar increases were present in the Minnesota and Ontario populations , suggesting that the age-specific and stage-specific incidence rates derived from the Greater Delaware Valley Tumour Registry , may understimate the true incidence within this specific subgroup . <p> Compared with our approach , what might a randomised controlled trial have shown ? The similarity of neuroblastoma in North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls introduced significant bias . Furthermore , the " halo " effect noted below would have involved both control and screened patients in a randomised population , hence confounding any results . We were testing an entire screening " approach " , not just the introduction of a screening test itself . As an additional control , annual incidence in Quebec province during the screening period , about 66/10 6 for the 0-4 age group as calculated from our data , is 2.4-fold higher than in the province before screening ( 28/10 6 ) . 2 <p> Neuroblastoma may represent at least two distinct clinical-biological entities. 19 , 20 One , favourable disease , probably congenital , is associated with young age and early stage at diagnosis , triploid karyotypes , no chromosome 1p abnormalities or N-myc amplification , more mature catecholamine synthesis and excretion , and excellent clinical outcome despite no or minimum therapy . Favourable neuroblastoma appears to be easily detected through screening for catecholamide metabolites , both in Japan 3 , 4 and in Quebec province . The second , unfavourable neuroblastoma , presents at an older age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deletions , N-myc amplification , less mature catecholamine synthesis and excretion , and poor outcome . Our data here and that suggested in smaller studies in Japan 21 , 22 document that screening for neuroblastoma at or before 6 months of age does not reduce the incidence of unfavourable neuroblastoma . Overall results of biological features , which will be reported elsewhere , confirm that characteristics of neuroblastomas detected by screening , or clinically detected before 1 year of age , are generally favourable , while older children detected clinically generally have neuroblastomas with unfavourable biology. 23 <p> Our results demonstrate a striking " halo " effect from the screening programme in which the overall incidence of neuroblastoma was increased , even if one excludes patients detected by screening ( figure 2 ) . Multiple public-relations and public-health methods aimed at improving compliance with screening in Quebec province were implemented during the screening period . Increased awareness of neuroblastoma in the entire province by health-care providers apparently led to more cases diagnosed than would have been otherwise , especially in the neonatal period . However , there was alsoan increase in cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.00-1.92 , with SEER controls ) . Others have hypothesised a similar reason for discrepant neuroblastoma incidences in various developed countries. 24 Theses effects raise the issue of whether children who are diagnosed with favourable neuroblastoma , especially at an early age , need any treatment for their " disease " . 23 , 25 Favourable neuroblastomas rarely , if ever , evolve into unfavourable disease. 26 <p> Furthermore , quantitation of regressing neuroblastomas 5 was impossible before our project . Therehas also been the suggestion of an increase in neuroblastoma incidence over the past 50 years. 27 , 28 We believe that a substantial portion of this increase may be due to better clinical detection of disease destined to regress . <p> Using state-of-the-art methodology and a compliance rate similar to that in Japan , we found that most children with neuroblastoma will not be detected by the examination of their urine for vanillylmandelic and homovanillic acids , up to 6 months of age , including children diagnosed with neuroblastoma over 1 year who do poorly . Although it has been assumed that all neuroblastomas are present in utero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all embryonal , many do not continuously excrete catecholamines , at least in sufficient quantities to be sure of detection . <p> Our results differ fom those reported in Japan , 3 , 4 except for studies in which attempts were made to examine population-based , rather than hospital-based , data. 21-23 Several other explanations may explain this discrepancy. 5 , 6 Earlier studies were done at a time when survival for neuroblastoma in Japan was inferior to that in North America and Europe . Therapeutic improvements in the past decade may have changed mortality . Screening studies in Japan have used retrospective controls . Finally , ascertainment of neuroblastoma cases and deaths has not been rigorous . For example , virtually no study has mentioned the occurence of neuroblastoma before 6 months of age . <p> The mortality assessment in the Quebec Project awaits longer follow-up and will give the definitive answer to the effectiveness of screening infants for neuroblastoma . However , the incidence data reported here support the conclusion that screening for this neoplasm in infants will not reduce mortality . Widespread screening for neuroblastoma at or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at later ages , 29 therefore should not be adopted anywhere in the world . <p> <p> Without the cooperation of the population of Quebec , this study would have been impossible .
