If your investment portfolio looks a little pale lately , a sunny trip overseas might be just the thing to perk it up . While Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index is likely to climb a respectable 10% this year as the domestic economy slows ( see MONEY 'S 1995 Forecast issue ) , many foreign markets are expected to do far better : A rising tide of economic activity figures to lift global stocks an average of 14% in 1995 . Fortunately , you can get overseas without a passport : Buying the world 's blue chips is as easy as dialing a broker . More than 500 foreign companies , from European banks to Asian utilities , list their shares on major U.S. exchanges as American Depository Receipts . But there 's one important difference : Because ADRs represent shares that trade on home exchanges in local currencies , fluctuations in the value of the dollar affect ADR returns . To minimize that currency risk , you should limit ADR purchases to 10% of your equity investments . ( For another global gambit , consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the box on page 71 . ) ( Box omitted ) What 's the best way to participate in booming growth abroad ? The dozen experts in international investing we polled overwhelmingly favored " infrastructure " plays-that is , companies that stand to benefit from their nation 's urgent need to bring key services like communications , transportation or banking up to world-class levels . We asked our experts to provide us with choice infrastructure stocks that met the following criteria : They occupy dominant positions in their industries ; they can be counted on to deliver double-digit growth but are selling at price/earnings ratios lower than their growth rates ; and they trade on a U.S. exchange rather than the " pink sheet " price lists and electronic bulletin boards , where securities do n't have to meet U.S. accounting standards . We considered only stocks endorsed by two or more of the analysts we consulted . The four standouts that passed our tests are described below , in descending order of potential 12- to 18-month returns : Telefonica de Argentina ( ticker symbol : TAR ; recently traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1.4% ) . With revenues at $2 billion , Telefonica de Argentina ranks as the largest phone company in one of Latin America 's zippiest economies . Charles Barnett , an analyst at Smith Barney in New York City , notes that Argentina badly needs additional telecommunications capacity : It has only 15 phone lines per 100 people , compared with about 60 here , for example . And Telefonica knows how to wire : Since the Argentine government privatized it in 1990 by spinning it off from a state-run telephone monopoly , the company has added nearly 1 million new lines to its 2 million base ; now , over the next five years , it will install another 1 million lines . As a result , Barnett says the company will ring up steady earnings advances of 25% to 30% annually for the next five years . Telefonica recently traded at 13.9 times earnings , or about half its projected earnings growth rate . The stock , which peaked in March at $82.50 , has dropped on selling by foreign investors spooked by rising U.S. interest rates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off around midyear , investors will rediscover Telefonica 's electrifying growth potential . He sees the stock reaching $95 in 12 to 18 months , a 76% gain . Espirito Santo Financial ( ESF ; NYSE , $12.50 ; 5% ) . Offering an array of banking , insurance and investment products , Espirito Santo Financial ( assets : $14.4 billion ) is well positioned to cash in on Portugal 's burgeoning demand for financial services . The company owns the nation 's third largest bank , Banco Espirito Santo , and its third largest insurance concern , Tranquilidade ; it also manages six Portuguese mutual funds . It compounds the value of these holdings by " cross selling . " For example , it induced its banking customers to snap up two-thirds of all the life insurance policies it wrote last year . The stock has suffered lately as investors worried that the 2-1/2-percentage-point rise in Portugal 's long-term interest rates over the past year would cut the profits of financial firms . After hitting a high of $19.50 in February , Espirito 's shares recently traded near their 12-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several foreign-stock experts believe investors have overreacted . " This is a cheap stock in a recovering economy , " says Eric Fry , a Mill Valley , Calif. money manager and author of International Investing with ADRs ( International , $24.95 ) . " Portugal is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable banking markets in Europe , " says Sasha Serafimovski , a London-based Merrill Lynch analyst . He expects Espirito to post 15% annual earnings growth over the next three to five years and sees its share price climbing as high as $20 by year 's end , a 60% jump . Cable &; Wireless PLC ( CWP ; NYSE , $17 ; 2.8% ) . Operating in 56 countries , this $8.1 billion British giant ( which we also recommended in December 's " How to Earn a Safe 10% on Your Money " ) figures to benefit from the demand for modern telephone service in Asia and other emerging markets . Cable &; Wireless ' most significant holding by far is its 57.5% stake in Hong Kong Telecom , which accounts for two-thirds of C &W's; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its home territory and is uniquely positioned to spearhead the development of a high-tech telecommunications network in China . For instance , it recently became the first foreign firm to negotiate a joint venture with China 's state telephone company . So why not buy HKT directly ? Well , you can , but it 'll cost you : Connie Luecke , an analyst at Duff &; Phelps in Chicago , notes that Hong Kong Telecom , whose ADRs also trade on the New York Stock Exchange , was recently priced at 18.5 times anticipated 1995 earnings , vs. 13.3 for Cable &; Wireless . Why is C &W's; P/E so low ? Because investors have fretted over a troubled subsidiary , Mercury Communications , that is 80% owned by C &W; and generates 20% of its revenues . Even with no profit growth from Mercury , however , Luecke sees Cable &; Wireless ' earnings expanding by 13% annually over the next five years and its stock price climbing to $23 by the end of this year , a 35% rise . Empresas ICA Sociedad Controladora , S.A. ( ICA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in sales , Mexico 's Empresas ICA dominates the construction industry of a nation begging for buildings . Mexico needs 1 million new housing units a year to satisfy families clamoring for their own homes . What 's more , the nation must spend $34 billion on power plants over the next five to 10 years to generate enough electricity ; Mexico also has a driving need for new roads . That activity promises to keep Empresas ' earnings growing at a 15% pace over the next three years , says Juan Carlos Garcia , an analyst at Salomon Bros. in New York City . Weeks of bloody rioting and the March assassination of the ruling party 's presidential candidate battered the Mexican market in 1994 , and even rock-solid ICA did not escape the damage ; despite its soaring prospects , it currently trades at just 12.5 times Garcia 's estimate of its 1995 earnings . The analyst foresees ICA stock trading at $38 by the end of the year , a 28% gain . And that would be impressive . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
