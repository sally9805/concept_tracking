Then the shark breaks the surface , exploding upwards in a raging froth of water , now closer to the fence , Carter gasping for breath . &nbsp; CARTER ( screaming ) Blow it . Blow the charge . Susan looks down . The generator wire attached to the harpoon is uncoiling wildly off the deck . She grabs the contact end , reaches towards the boat battery . She turns , sees Carter pinned to the shark . It finishes a wide circle and barrels towards the fence . &nbsp; CARTER ( screaming ) Do it ! ! And then he is gone , the shark submerging once more . Susan looks at the wire , uncoiling ever more rapidly now . 171 EXT . UNDERWATER The mighty Gen II , Carter still clutching its back , hits the fence with all its might and the metal finally gives , the fence breaking , the shark bursting free , into the open ocean . Carter is reaching towards his boot , reaching for something we can not see . . . 172 EXT . SURFACE - AQUATICA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes taut . At the last instant , Susan , face streaming with tears , touches the generator contact to the battery . A tiny spark . 173 EXT . LAGOON A tremendous underwater EXPLOSION as the surface of the ocean erupts with a ROARING GEYSER of frothing water and blood . 174 EXT . SURFACE - AQUATICA Susan stares in shock at the now settling water . A beat . Then she falls to her knees , looks up and screams at the heavens .  --  135  --  &nbsp; MCALESTERNoooo ! PULL BACK AND UP ON this small figure , alone amidst the ruins . &nbsp; CARTER ( O. S. ) Hey . A head has broken the surface . Susan races to the edge as Carter swims awkwardly to the platform . She pulls him up onto the deck , his leg a bloody mess . &nbsp; MCALESTERHow . . . ? Carter holds up the knife she gave him , gestures to an incision in the wet suit . &nbsp; CARTERPretty good knife after all . She puts her arms around his torso , half supporting him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe you just blew me up . &nbsp; MCALESTERYou told me to . &nbsp; CARTERYou 've never listened to me before . . . PULL BACK AND UP as they head for the raft , two humans keeping each other standing , holding on . Section Details 175 EXT . DEEP BLUE SEA - DAWN Upon the bluest of seas , debris of every kind floats in the water . A jar with a videotape inside drifts amongst the ruins . A hand ENTERS FRAME , lifts the bottle . WIDEN .  --  136  --  EXT . LIFE RAFT - CONTINUOUS ACTION Susan removes the tape , tosses the bottle overboard . Behind her , only the very tips of the now sunken Aquatica . Carter and Preacher nod out in the bobbing inflatable . A familiar TUNE . Preacher has regained consciousness , is humming , now singing " I Can See Clearly Now . " Carter and McAlester look at him , puzzled . That 's when they hear it , too . . . PIANO MUSIC faintly drifts in from far over the water . &nbsp; SONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain is gone . I can see all obstacles in my way . Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind . . . In the distance , the water taxi filled with a new crew is coming across the waters , its speakers filling the morning with song . &nbsp; SONG ( V. O. ) . . .
