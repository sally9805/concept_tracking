Section : CULTURE VULTURES Funny thing is , most of them are over 35 . <p> You can tell a lot about any society from its deceptions . A century ago , the female author of The Mill on the Floss felt obliged to invent a male identity for herself , " George Eliot . " These days , the last thing any aspiring novelist would do would be to try and pass herself off as a man-especially a white one . Indeed , in Australia there 's been a stampede in the opposite direction : So many fashionably primitive aboriginal female artists have been belatedly unmasked as canny Caucasian male opportunists that Parliament has now made it illegal to falsely claim to be a native person . Here in America , even Oprah Winfrey was taken in by The Education of Little Tree , the bestselling reminiscences of a Cherokee boy who , unfortunately , turned out to be not a Cherokee but a Klansman , Forrest Carter , the fellow who wrote George Wallace 's " segregation forever " speech . Alas , neither Oprah nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for the film rights , could see the Forrest for the Little Tree . <p> But it 's surely as telling that Forrest pretended to be not just a Cherokee but a young Cherokee . In our culture we venerate not the mighty oaks and ancient maples but the little trees : If you 're a sapling , we 'll gladly be the saps . So it was with hot TV writer/actress Riley Weston , who , according to her agent , her studio , and the colleagues on her hit TV show who threw her an on-set birthday party a couple of months back , is 19 years old . <p> But , as with so much else nowadays , it depends on what the meaning of the word " is " is . Miss Weston certainly was 19 once , back in 1985 , when she was going under the name Kimberlee Kramer or Kimberlee Seaman or one of the other passing monikers of her varied life , But , tired of nowhere jobs , the 32-year-old actress decided to re-invent herself as " Riley Weston , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimberlee-or Riley  --  is 4'n " , weighs 93 lbs. , and is blessedly unwrinkled . She wears baggy jeans and sneakers ; she has a Titanic poster on her office wall ; she claims to have a crush on the teenager who plays Tim Allen 's son on " Home Improvement " ; she says " like " and " duh " a lot . If that 's not a 19-year-old , what is ? Disney execs took one look at her and offered a $300,000 contract . <p> What a great country . Maybe it 's not true that anyone can grow up to be president , but it seems anyone can grow up to be a presidential-class liar  --  as long as you do n't grow up , that is . When the yellowing parchment of Miss Weston 's birth certificate turned up and it emerged that Disney had signed the world 's oldest child prodigy , the hoodwinked honchos were furious . In this business , if you 're old , you 're dead-unless you 're shrewd enough to hire some fresh-faced kid in tune with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid turns out to be some middle-aged divorcee only a couple of years away from the Angela Lansbury roles , what does that say about you ? What sort of schmuck claims to be in tune with America 's youth and then signs some dame almost as old as his first wife ? So now Miss Weston 's fate hangs in the balance . Aside from having shaved 13 years off her age , the **30;1043;TOOLONG claims not to have done anything wrong . " The person they knew is me , " she told Entertainment Weekly . " I talk like this , wear these clothes . " <p> Big deal . Who does n't ? Walk down any American Main Street . Half a century ago , it would have been full of solid citizens in three-piece suits , homburgs , pocket watches , the works . Now 50-year-old guys lumber around in oversize T-shirts with silly slogans , shapeless diaper-like pants , huge bouncy sneakers ; they slurp from plastic soda containers with strange nipple caps , just like baby bottles . I do n't usually pay much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Frenchman and a German complained to me recently that they found it almost physically nauseating to walk around an American shopping mall because everyone looks so ... infantile , I thought they had a point . In recent months , there 've been endless pieces comparing Rockefeller 's and Bill Gates 's wealth , but the most telling comparison is the accompanying photographs : Gates is the richest man in the world , locked in combat with the government of the last superpower on the face of the earth , and he 's dressed like the junior clerk at the video store . We do n't need Dress-Down Friday , we need Dress-Up Monday To Thursday . <p> I blame Steven Spielberg , whose own variable birth date has been the subject of two lawsuits . Despite being a 50-year-old executive with a billion dollars in the bank , he 's so determinedly boyish he insists on the same uniform of sneakers , jeans , sweatshirt , and baseball cap he 's always worn . Now all his fellow Hollywood " suits " wear it , too : Soon there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual types to look down on . Spielberg 's Hollywood is like The Rewrite of Dorian Gray : The younger these fellows dress , the more stuntedly immature the product gets . <p> In our youth-crazed culture , Miss Weston is not , of course , the only one trying to pass as an eager teen , and in fairness she 's doing a better job of it than many others desperate to make it in Hollywood . Take Al Gore : Like Riley Weston , he 's uncannily in tune with the concerns of today 's youth-global warming , gay rights , you name it . But once in a while the effort of keeping up the act begins to show . At a party in Hollywood recently , he happened to find himself next to Courtney Love , widow of grunge rocker Kurt Cobain and now lead singer with the popular beat combo Hole . " I 'm a really big fan , " gushed the Vice-Panderer . To her credit , showing a disdain for establishment approval rare among today 's aristorockracy , Miss Love declined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like , ' Yeah , right . Name a song , Al . ' " The panicked veep floundered helplessly until his minders eventually moved in to put him out of his misery . It 's a poignant vignette , with an eerie echo of a British Labour Party veteran 's advice to politicians in trouble . According to Denis Healey , the First Rule of Holes is : " When you 're in one , stop digging . " In this case , when you 're with one , stop pretending to dig her . <p> If he 's still interested , Hole 's new album is called Celebrity Skin and Al might find its title song useful for a Gore 2000 campaign theme : " No second billing ' cause you 're a star now .... " The question is : Is he ? Can Al Gore rise to the top of the bill ? In a sane world , the vice president 's ignorance of the Love oeuvre would be cause for celebration : It would have been far more shocking if he 'd glibly reeled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed Bill Clinton and , if there 's one thing Bill Clinton has his fingers on the pulse of , it 's the youth of America . I hasten to add that he does n't literally have his fingers on the youth of America : As his grandjury testimony made clear , he favors a scrupulously hands-off approach . But turn to footnote 707 of the Starr Report , a letter from Monica to Bill : " When I was hiding out in your office , I noticed you had the new Sarah McLachlan CD . I have it , too , and it 's wonderful . Whenever I listen to song #5 I think of you . " <p> Sarah McLachlan ! In the Oval Office ! When I first read it , Monica 's note brought me up short and I gave an involuntary shudder . Like most guys with an eye for pliant young flesh ( again , Bill " Look , No Hands " Clinton insists he was n't actually plying Monica 's flesh , but let that pass ) , I recognized the moment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming ( in small doses ) , but damn it , now she wants to know what kind of music you like . I ca n't be the only busy executive who 's found himself buzzing through to the outer office : " Miss Jones , I 'm scheduled for oral sex with my intern this afternoon . Find out what ghastly caterwauling the young people are into these days and order up ten CDs in assorted colors . I think my Robert Goulet eight-tracks are beginning to throw her off . And for God 's sake do n't get that second Hootie and the Blowfish album again : Mindy in Accounts still wo n't speak to me . " <p> But then it occurred to me : Maybe the new Sarah McLachlan CD is on the Oval Office desk because the president actually likes it . In 1993 , in the week Bill Clinton took his oath of office , I happened to be on a radio show with the editor of Vanity Fair , Graydon Carter , who 'd just returned from the " MTV Inaugural Ball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the inauguration of " the most powerful man in the world " should be officially marked with a formal ball thrown by the rock video channel ? Oh , lighten up , he said : " It 's no different from Reagan having Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians at his inaugural . " Just for the record , Guy Lombardo did n't play at President Reagan 's inaugural , if only because he 'd been dead for four years . But , even if he had , I ca n't imagine Ronald Reagan having a Guy Lombardo LP  --  or 78 , or whatever they had back in the eighties  --  on the Oval Office desk . <p> " Do What You Have 170 Do , " sings Sarah McLachlan on Bill and Monica 's " song #5 . ' But what is it that Bill Clinton has to do ? He tells his fellow citizens repeatedly that he needs to " get back to work for the American people . " But he has time to listen to the new Sarah McLachlan ; time to have 90-minute phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer office , after informing her that regrettably they 'll have to cut out the oral sex , and join her in a duet of " Try a Little Tenderness . " <p> Most of us assume that , if like Monica we ever got to rummage around the president 's desk for half an hour , we 'd at least stumble across some IMF Russian bailout proposals or a NATO plan to bomb Serbia . We would , frankly , be disappointed to press the nuclear strike button and find it just cranked up the new Natalie Merchant CD . But the Cold War is over and in the Cool War the president can hold his own , with a song for every occasion . One of the many fun games to play with the Starr Report is to pull quotes at random and guess whether it 's Bill or Monica talking : " If I had known what kind of person you really were , I would n't have got involved with you . " The airhead Valley Girl ? No , the father of our country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Riley Weston 's show on the WB network , said : " We thought we had found a staffer who spoke the language . " So did America : All that stuff about the bridge to the twenty-first century , so noble , so presidential . But it seems that , just like Riley , Bill 's been lying about his age-trying to pass himself off as a mature , sober statesman when he 's actually just a ditzy adolescent . But what was he to do ? Like Riley he knew that if he told the truth about his age , he 'd never get the gig . After all , the Constitution says you ca n't be president unless you 're over 35  --  which must surely be a typing error by the Founders : Face it , every other job in America worth having you ca n't get unless you 're under 35 . <p> So maybe the simplest solution for our two most famous liars ' predicaments would be to swap jobs . It turns out Riley 's so old she 's almost old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's certainly young enough to work on " Felicity , " a show about an 18-year-old college freshman . Meanwhile , if Al Gore is n't entirely comfortable with a presidency that 's now the triumphant apotheosis of the American urge to defer adulthood , he might look for a pop star who 's easier on the ear than Miss Love . My suggestion would be Gene Autry , who died a few months ago . Being a nonagenarian , Autry 's passing did n't generate the buzz Riley Weston did . But in these troubled times the sagebrush troubadour 's Cowboy Code seems more timely than ever , especially Rules Number Three ( " The Cowboy must always tell the truth " ) , Number Eight ( " He must keep himself clean in thought , speech , action and personal habits " ) , and Number Nine ( " He must respect women , parents and his nation 's laws " ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kids today <p> By Mark Steyn <p> <p> MARK STEYN is theater critic of the New Criterion and movie critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
