<p> Dozens of how-to books fill library shelves , but the Comets at the midpoint of their second season are writing one that could be titled , " How to Build A Dynasty . " <p> The Comets are not only showing in record-breaking fashion they are the class of the 10-team Women 's National Basketball Association ; they are wiping out the competition . <p> After the Comets downed the Rockers 78-64 at Cleveland on July 6 , Rockers coach Linda Hill-MacDonald said , " They have no weaknesses . " <p> Two nights later when Van Chancellor 's Comets beat New York 79-54 at Madison Square Garden , Liberty coach Nancy Darsch called the Comets " an awesome team . " <p> From Sacramento to Charlotte and Phoenix to New York , people in the WNBA are indeed awed by the 14-1 Comets ' success . <p> " Can you believe what the Comets are doing ? " one fan said as he exited Cleveland 's Gund Arena a week ago . " They 're not just beating people ; they 're killin ' ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their next opponent . <p> " I 'm not necessarily surprised by the start , " Cynthia Cooper said Tuesday . " I 'm happy that we 're motivated enough to come out every game and play hard , give 100 percent offensively and on the defensive end . <p> " Everyone here knew that we were a talented team . The test was whether we would be able to put everything together . I think we 've put the pieces of the puzzle together , and now we 're playing well . " <p> Nine of the Comets ' wins have been by 14 points or more . Three have been by at least 25 , and the expansion Detroit Shock fell 96-66 at Compaq Center on Thursday , the most lopsided victory in Comets history . <p> When they caught fire in the second half Monday night and blew away the expansion Washington Mystics 81-67 , the Comets set WNBA records for consecutive wins ( nine ) and consecutive home victories ( eight ) . <p> Those outside of Houston who have watched might be stunned . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered whether the team harmony that carried the Comets to the inaugural league title might be stymied by a clash of egos . <p> Cooper or Sheryl Swoopes might have to go , it was thought . There would n't be enough basketballs to go around among Swoopes , Cooper and the multitalented Tina Thompson , according to one theory . <p> But ask Chancellor how his team has hoisted itself so high above the crowd , and his answer is immediate . <p> " I do n't think there 's any doubt , " he said . " We 've added a healthy Sheryl Swoopes , and that just gives us another weapon . She was 10-for-18 ( in Monday 's win over Washington ) , gets seven rebounds . Plus you add Janeth Arcain , it just makes us stronger . <p> " ( Point guard Kim Perrot has ) been a lot better this year , much better than I thought she 'd be - not than I thought she could be , but I thought she would be - this early . She 's been excellent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names roll easily off Chancellor 's tongue . But he could talk about each of his 11 players , for each has contributed . <p> " They 've got a little inner something , a little inner confidence , something about them that separates them from the average team , " Chancellor said . " They 're 11 points down in the second half , and they do n't panic . They think they 're going to win . And they 're going to play hard . <p> " I 'll tell you this much . This is the biggest reason , and nobody knows this . Everybody talks about them from a superstar point of view . But we 've got some of the best defensive players in the whole league . And when you 've got defensive players , you 've got a shot . " <p> Being able to shut down the opposition is what the Comets point to as the reason for their success . The Comets , No. 1 in the league in offense ( 78.4 points per game ) , give up only 64.7 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were at or near the top defensively last year , but the addition of Swoopes and Perrot 's improvement have made them better . <p> " They just have great anticipation , " Chancellor said . " Kim 's about the biggest pest on defense that 's ever played this game . She just has great quickness . And Sheryl has great anticipation . Unbelievable anticipation . " <p> Perrot is No. 2 in the league in steals ( three per game ) ; Swoopes is third ( 2.29 ) . <p> No one has scored more than 73 points against the Comets . It took Utah two overtime periods to score that , though the Starzz lost 75-73 . <p> Utah forward Fran Harris , who played for the Comets last season , knows why her former team has been successful . <p> " Part of the reason they 're a great team is they have great players , they have great individual talent , " she said . " And also , they have a coach who allows them to play within themselves as individuals , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot . When you 've got a coach like that , it 's easy to play for him . Then , you know that if you make a mistake , he is n't going to take you right out of the game . <p> " Also , Houston is already developing a strong tradition , having won last year . They have a lot of confidence , and they have a lot of strength in terms of just the veteran players they have on the team . I think that 's what makes them really good . " <p> The Comets did n't get their 14th win last season @x . 19 . They never lost more than two games in a row and compiled the league 's best record ( 18-10 ) . <p> The Comets , who leave Thursday for a four-game road trip , could equal that win total by the time they return July 28 to host the Phoenix Mercury , the only team to beat them this season . <p> The Comets have survived the schedule-makers , who crammed the first 15 games into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Comets are three games ahead of Phoenix ( 10-3 ) and 2 1/2 games better than the next-best team in the league , Charlotte ( 11-3 ) . <p> Complacency might be their most serious adversary , only it does n't show . <p> " The only thing bigger than a star is a fallen star , " Cooper said . " So this is not the end of the season ; this is the middle of the season . And we just need to take one game at a time and be in good shape toward the end of the season . " <p> The Comets are in good shape in terms of the schedule . Once the upcoming road swing is complete , the Comets leave Compaq Center only four times before the end of the regular season . Phoenix will mark the start to the longest homestand of the season . The Starzz are back July 30 . The Cleveland Rockers are here Aug. 1 . The following night , Sacramento makes its final appearance at Compaq Center . <p> On Aug. 4 , the Comets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit on Aug. 7 , then finish the away schedule with a two-game trip to New York ( Aug. 15 ) and Washington ( Aug. 17 ) . The regular season ends Aug. 19 , with a Western Conference game against the Los Angeles Sparks at Compaq Center . <p> Can the Comets play the final 15 games without a loss ? <p> " I do n't think there 's any way because , first of all , the road 's too tough , " Chancellor said . " Because of a quirk in this odd schedule in the East , we still have to go back and play Charlotte in Charlotte , which is playing well . We still have to go back and play New York , and you ca n't say they wo n't be ready for us . <p> " And we still have Phoenix . And with as much talent as LA has , I still think they 're a factor . "
