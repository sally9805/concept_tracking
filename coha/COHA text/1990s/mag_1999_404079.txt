// On the east coast of the Canadian maritime province of New Brunswick lies Kouchibouguac National Park , a forty-square-mile preserve encompassing dunes , salt marshes , forests , and an extensive bog . Never heavily populated , the landscape is mostly undisturbed . Where the land was used-for pasture , farming , or timber-the vegetation has begun to grow back in the thirty years since the park was created . Nearly eight square miles of the park consists of Kelly 's Bog , which occupies low terrain overlying deposits of marine clay . A forest probably took over this area when the Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago , but because the clay impeded drainage , the sphagnum , or peat moss , growing there began to create a thick deposit of dead organic material . By about 4,500 years ago , few trees could survive in the unstable , boggs soil . The sphagnum and other vegetation visible today grows on twenty feet of peat that has built up above the water table-for this reason , the habitat is known as a domed bog . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observation tower or follow a half-mile boardwalk . The pathway from the parking lot passes through boreal forest to a treeless " lagg zone " that encircles the bog . Trees can not grow here because the water table lies immediately beneath the surface . Beyond the lagg zone rises the bog itself . Although the peat acts like a giant sponge , soaking up and storing water from rain , snow , and fog , a scattering of stunted black spruces and larches , some a hundred years old , still manage to grow there . Animals frequenting the bog include song sparrows and savanna sparrows , yellow-throated warblers and palm warblers , voles , lemllzv.ngs , moose , and white-tailed deer . The park includes other rewarding trails . The Salt Marsh Trail is a boardwalk that leads inland through a salt marsh and into an adjacent forest of red spruce and balsam fir . Wetland and aquatic plants can be observed from the Beaver Trail , which circles a pond and adjacent wetland created by the activity of beavers . Another route is Kelly 's Beach Trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow salty inlet , gradually leads upward to a sandy ridge , and then continues over the sand dunes that parallel the shore . The Pine Trail features a number of huge white pine trees that were spared during the massive lumbering that took place in the nineteenth century . White pines were used extensively in shipbuilding , a major industry along the New Brunswick coast . But few white pine seedlings can be found here now ; this disturbed area is becoming a red spruce-balsam fir forest . Lumbering opened the competition to spruces and firs , and old white pines produce few seeds and in some places form a closed canopy that inhibits the growth of seedlings . Robert H.

Growing in small pools of standing water are yellow-flowering bladderwort and the water lily-like spatterdock . Stunted treesblack spruce and larch-also appear , along with a number of low-growing shrubs , such as sweet fern ( of the wax myrtle family ) , bog rosemary , Labrador tea , cloudberry , crowberry , and a low-bush blueberry . Salt marsh plants include salt marsh cordgrass , salt meadow cordgrass , tall cordgrass , and Gerard 's rush . The salty inlet along Kelly 's Beach Trail harbors several species of cordgrass as well as salt grass , seaside goldenrod , sea lavender , sea rocket , a saltwater plantain , pickleweed , and bacopa , a little blue-flowering plant in the snapdragon family . Dune plants include beach sweet pea , beach heather , beach wormwood , and the ubiquitous milfoil , or yarrow . The roots of the large marram grass are extremely important in stabilizing the sand dunes because this plant , which appears in clumps , can often grow in places where no other vegetation succeeds . Two species of birds that nest in the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One is the common tern , which is experiencing competition from gulls , and the other is the piping plover , an endangered North American species . Beaver wetland plants include cattail , pussy willow , swamp candles ( a yellow loosestrife with candelabra-like flower clusters ) , horehound , blue iris , white-fringed orchid , perfoliate boneset , halberdleaved tearthumb , and blue joint grass . Boreal forest consists of balsam fir , red spruce , hemlock , and white cedar over a shrubby layer of speckled alder and raisin tree viburnum . In the shade beneath the woody plants are bunchberry , bluebead lily , Canada mayflower , interrupted fern , cinnamon fern , and a variety of sedges . Red spruce-balsam fir forest also contains striped maple , white birch , hemlock , red maple , and American beech . Shrubs include red elderberry and the evergreen spreading yew . Among the wildflowers are pink lady's-slipper orchid , trillium , twinleaf , wild sarsaparilla , and starflower . <p>                   @ @
