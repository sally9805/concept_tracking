Behind the house a crow cawed irritably as the rains began . <p> Inside , close enough to an open window to hear the crow , Wyatt was packing . He had had enough . It was time to leave , to move on . He had opened his suitcase so that its lid fell back over the edge of the bed , and he had carefully folded a few pairs of underwear , some socks and trousers , and laid them out neatly so that they would n't get jumbled together . He put his favorite sport shirt , speckled green like an unripe banana , at the top , next to a pair of tennis shoes , his teddy bear , and a night-light . The night-light took a fifteen-watt bulb and had Scottie dogs painted on its sides . He did n't know if they had electrical outlets where he was going , wherever that was , but if they did , he would have the light . He was eight years old . <p> There were some animals who would wonder what had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom on the cool tiles near the toilet . Wyatt patted him on the head , and the dog woke up and slurped at Wyatt 's face , his tail wagging . On the dog 's face was a puzzled expression . Was there to be fun ? Or not ? Wyatt said good-bye to him , then called down the hallway to Laura . The old arthritic dalmatian came out of his parents ' room and groaned her way down the hall . Wyatt hugged her ; she had taught him how to swim two summers ago . Today she smelled of burlap and dirt . She was so old , she was almost earth again . <p> Carrying his suitcase and passing Gretel 's room , he heard his sister say , " Where you going ? " <p> " I 'm leaving . " <p> " Again ? Oh yeah , sure you are . " Her door was open wide enough so that he could see how she was reading in front of the mirror , her preferred location , checking her face to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes ago . Wyatt had told her several times that he was going to run away , and she had had two reactions : gleeful ( " Good idea . Why do n't you leave right now ? " ) and skeptical ( " You 'll get about as far as the driveway " ) . But now he had outsmarted her : he was actually doing it , taking off , and he would n't have to see her anymore , her poisoned smile or her curly hair that made him want to shout in her face . <p> The house was a tri-level , the first one ever built in Five Oaks , and the way the rooms were arranged , like a series of randomly connected L 's , allowed Wyatt to get to the back door without being seen by his parents . His father , an architect , would be in the basement anyway , working on some carpentry project or other , and his mother would be in the kitchen , making one of her gloomy stews while she talked on the telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't miss them very much . <p> He grabbed the knob on the back door with his free hand and flung it open . Standing in the doorway , he felt the rain spattering down on his face . He had always liked the paraphernalia of storms : hail , lightning , darkness , thunder . Last fall when his friend Harry Peet had told him that he , sometimes , hid under the dining room table during storms , Wyatt had n't believed it . He had opened his mouth , not in fake disbelief , the way his sister did it , but in real disbelief , right there on the playground . <p> " But it 's a show , " Wyatt had said , " storms are . You got to watch it or you miss it . " <p> He was running now with his suitcase past the backyard tire swing and the old sandbox nobody used anymore , a puddle of water already in the center near his rusting steam shovel . He felt his shirt getting sopped . His shoes made a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he made it to the woods behind the house , he would be safe . He would live there . His parents would n't find him . He was safe anyway : his mother and father would n't bother looking for him . They noticed him about as much as the cat did , maybe less , because he was the one who usually fed the cat . <p> In front of him the woods smiled open , smelling of pine trees and decaying grass , and the rain pattered on the dry leaves like inhuman whispering . At the edge of the woods he turned around . He thought he should look at the house one last time . He would never see it again , after all . As he raised his eyes , the crow cawed again , even more irritably now . <p> The house appeared to be the same as ever , a mess of boxes and angles and windows . Once again he felt ashamed of living in the only modern house in town , as if his parents could n't stand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sort of structure that everyone else lived in . This one could be a Lego construction , a home for aliens . <p> His sister was staring out of her window at him , having dragged herself away from the mirror . Her elbows were propped up on the windowsill and her head rested in her hands , and Wyatt thought that she would at least bother to wave , but she did n't . She was pretty in a particularly annoying way : her blond hair and even face gave a phony impression of kindness . He had just started to notice this . At Christmas , his relatives all said , " Gretel , you look so sweet , " while she smiled that awful , creepy smile of hers , and they dolloped out the presents in her direction . She was watching him now , the queen of I-don't-care , with the blank face she used on him most of the time , as if she were practicing to be a ghost , or an only child . He decided to wave at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand out at the side of her face , a casual gesture that could be mistaken for an effort to rearrange her hair and somehow fit in a wave , along with that , without making trouble for herself . <p> To hell with them , he thought , and the words , terrible to him , made him feel brave and almost grown-up . As he turned and pushed himself past a hawthorn bush on the edge of their property , catching his pants , he remembered that he had left behind his baseball mitt . Also his transistor radio and his pocket piece of purple fluorite . But he was n't about to go back ; he could see everybody laughing when he opened the door and crept back into the house with his leaking suitcase and his wet hair hanging down his forehead . <p> He turned one last time and ran into the woods . <p> Downstairs Wyatt 's father , Eugene , was bent over his worktable . To the side was a small unfinished contraption with several boards and something like a roof , birdhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was not a birdhouse . Whatever it was , they would have to guess . Not a doghouse , not a rattrap , not a rabbit hutch ... not anything , not yet . The pieces of cut pine were set up in neat piles behind him , and a preliminary drawing for certain parts of this object had been taped to the worktable . <p> A short , compact man , with fine hair just starting to gray and a face deeply and prematurely lined , Eugene habitually gave himself a good deal of credit . He had just reached for his bottle of Jack Daniel 's and was pouring himself a drink into a Dixie cup . He drank on weekends , all weekend , but not during the week . Drinking lifted his mood , made him feel like an old-fashioned dirigible , floating over everything . No one he knew had figured out how he could drink this way , with ironic restraint . It was not the norm in Five Oaks or anywhere else . He was a man proud of his moods and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking would be part of a system , a system that he had first invented and then put into play , and it would work for him , this system , but for no one else . <p> Pens and pencils filled his shirt pocket . <p> He was not , as it happened , working at this moment . He was sipping whiskey , and his hand was over his heart as he stared toward the north wall , where he had hung his tools on pegs : hammer , screwdriver , pliers , all in their proper places over the outlines he had drawn with felt pens . His wife , Jeanne , had told him that he was the sort of man who was made content by the organization of objects , as opposed to ideas , and it was true . But right now , inside his chest , and then , down near the spine , was a new object , out of place : a bright , blazing star . What was a star doing in his chest ? He took another sip of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartburn . He could n't say exactly that it hurt , because pain was dark , the pressure of a shadow , and this , whatever it was , was extremely bright , like a spotlight . No : this thing in his chest made him feel as if someone had thrown a lariat around him and he was being hauled in . <p> With his hand over his heart , he smiled quickly for his own benefit ; he sometimes could improve his own mood by smiling to himself , he was that transparent . He turned to look at the wallpaper pattern of antique clocks , all of them showing the same time : 3:30 . In this basement , thanks to the wallpaper , it was always 3:30 . Wyatt and Gretel called this the 3:30 room . The wallpaper had been his wife 's idea , and he had n't bothered to object to it . Now he liked it . He liked how it would always be midafternoon here , especially now that there was a star in his chest where his heart , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the drawer . The little pieces of white paper inside trembled like strips of packing excelsior . He had been scribbling thoughts and depositing them in the drawer for years , ever since Gretel had been born , and he had come down here when he could n't sleep , anxious with parental responsibilities . By now the drawer was nearly filled . Soon it would overflow with thoughts . He took out a pen , wrote down " Stars do n't belong in the body ; it should always be pitch-dark in there " on a slip of paper , and dropped it in . He pulled out a thought at random : " Sunlight in July : blank and powerful and rather stupid . Stupid people and children are always happy during the summer . I myself am undecided . " <p> This thought now struck him as too simple and certainly unpleasant in its snobbery , and he tore it up . He reached in and drew out another thought . This one was underlined , so he must have meant it when he thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subcontractor about practical matters . A great relief from speculation . I should n't bother worrying over the big questions . They just disturb me . <p> He put that thought back . He did n't feel like having any thoughts now ; the star in his chest was shining too hotly and brightly . Feeling like a solar system , he walked past Wyatt 's crayon portrait of him , labeled " My daddy by WYATT , " in which he was smiling a jagged child-surrealist Crayola grin , a kind of stick-figure hilarity he wanted to feel for his son 's benefit but usually had to fake , and he arrived at the Ping-Pong table . Near the paddles , Gretel had left her toy nurse 's set scattered . Next to a yellow plastic hypodermic needle and a bottle filled with tongue depressors was a genuine stethoscope she had purchased at a local medical supply store with her own money . Leaning against the Ping-Pong table , he picked up the stethoscope and felt its peculiar rubbery tubes . Gretel was twelve and used to enjoy playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on the Ping-Pong table ?  --  he put the listening devices into his ears and placed the stethoscope 's diaphragm inside his shirt , over his chest at exactly the point where the star was radiating its light outward . <p> He listened . Through the rubber tubes came the sounds of a pulsating , moiling , and roaring bump and flow ; a thick , muscular , fleshy thumping halfway between the sounds of a pumping station and a stamping plant . The chaos of the noise from his chest made his forehead break out in a light sweat . His chest sounded industrial and mechanical to him . I have not paid attention , he thought , to this before , this noise . <p> He walked to the window and gazed out at the rain , the stethoscope flapping against his chest . Blood and muscle , and the unreliable human fuses and tissue . He liked rain in September , its calm gray pattering . Through the wet trees beyond his yard he thought he saw something , some small object , moving . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the Ping-Pong table . She liked to come into rooms silently , to creep around and suddenly materialize behind him ; it was one of her special talents . " Daddy , what are you doing with my stethoscope ? " <p> " I 'm listening to my heart . " <p> " How come ? " <p> " Because it 's there . I never heard it before . Here I am , at my age , and I never heard the beating of my heart before . Thump thump . Thumpthump thump . " <p> " That 's the systolic and diastolic flow you 're hearing , " she said , struggling not to look smug . She picked up a Ping-Pong paddle . " Want to play ? " <p> The star would n't permit it . He could feel solar flares rising into his shoulders and arms . " No , kiddo , I do n't think so . " <p> " Want to listen to my heart ? " He gazed at his daughter for a moment . Then he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not today . But there is something I will listen to . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Your head . I 'll listen to your thoughts . " <p> " You ca n't hear thoughts . " She was smiling . <p> " Oh , yes , I can . " He placed the diaphragm on top of his daughter 's head and listened . All he heard was the rustle of her hair . " Your thoughts sound like a field of crickets . I hear your schemes . You 're planning on going roller-skating tomorrow . " From outside came a brief flash of light and , a second later , thunder . " You 're thinking about that book you 're reading ... " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " And you 're thinking about Wyatt . " <p> " Am not . " She removed the stethoscope from her head . " What am I thinking about him ? " <p> He smiled and shrugged . " That he 's a pest . All sisters have sour thoughts about their little brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's find out his thoughts . " <p> " I do n't  --  " But Eugene was already headed up the stairs . He felt better already . The star was gone . When he reached Wyatt 's room , the door was closed , and Eugene knocked , but when no one answered , he went inside and saw that the bed had been made neatly , the lights left off , the toys put away . The map of the New York City subway system was pinned to the wall above his bed ; Eugene had brought the map back after a business trip , and Wyatt had promptly memorized many of the stops . Nothing was out of place . It did n't look like a boy 's room at all . It was as if a maid service had come here and straightened up . Eugene felt a shiver travel up his back along his spine . Gretel stood in the hallway , watching him . <p> " Gretel , where 's your brother ? " <p> She waited for five seconds . Then she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where ? " <p> " To the woods . He took something with him . " <p> " What ? " <p> " His suitcase this time , the blue one . He took some clothes . He left a note . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " On his dresser . Over there . " She pointed . <p> Eugene had made that dresser , with its four drawers , a few months after his son was born , and he could still feel the maple and pine under his hands , a love he felt for his son transferring itself to the wood . Next to a plastic comb was a small piece of paper on which his son had written , " Goodbuy and see you in a few years , signed Wyatt . " <p> " Good God . " <p> " He says you never do anything with him . " She spoke these words plainly , like a court reporter , almost without interest . " He said you 're always in the basement and do n't notice him at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When was this ? " <p> " Out there . Five minutes ago . He said he was going to maybe live in the woods or go to Aunt Ellen 's house or something . He said he had had it . " <p> " Christ Almighty . Did n't he notice the storm ? " <p> " Daddy , you know how he likes storms . " <p> " Jeanne ! " He was shouting now , in the direction of where he thought his wife might be . " Jeanne ! " <p> Wyatt came to a clearing and heaved his suitcase over a fence . For a hundred feet ahead of him was a flat green meadow where the neighbors ' horses , Simon and Lennie , sometimes grazed , and over to his right was a salt lick , a pinkish-colored , one-foot-high block with a single depression in the center . Carrying his suitcase , and feeling his clothes clinging to him , he felt  --  now that he had actually escaped from the house where all they ever said was " No "  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had wanted to do . He bent down and lightly touched his tongue to the salt lick . It tasted of salt and horses and swamp gas . He licked at it again . He had always wanted to do this ; now he could . The horses were watching him and raised their large heads in a gesture of horse-interest . <p> Wyatt waved , picked up his suitcase , and started across the meadow . <p> Because they  --  his parents  --  had lied to him , had said they would buy him a rock tumbler for his agates , and they had n't ; and because they had left one time for New York without him or saying much about it , when they knew he wanted to ride the subways , and they had left Mrs. Conolly , with the warts on her face , in charge of the house and of him , humming her hymns and listening to her radio , the **25;0;TOOLONG station , WJCP ; and because he was sent to his room when he threw food at his sister , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , especially Jell-O , without being caught ; because his mother often stared unhappily at the ceiling ; and because his father sat and sat without any reason in the 3:30 room in the basement on weekends , building furniture or playing boogie-woogie on the piano and laughing for no reason by himself all alone but so you could hear it anywhere in the house ; because he drank that Jack Daniel 's and got happy all by frightened her , but not her son 's leaving . Children ran away , and then they came back . They all took themselves so seriously , and adults , like Eugene , who was half-child anyway , should not pretend that the theatrics were real . It was part of growing up . She herself had often felt like running away when she was a child , and then , a few times , as a young woman , after she had been married . It was called acting out , as she knew very well , and it was a form of giving in to yourself . She had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most people do n't ; at least most women do n't . Jeanne had lain in bed , waiting for the sun to rise , and it always did , bringing another day in which she was the same person in the same place . You could learn to live with most things , and after a while pain did n't make any difference . Anger made no difference , either . She had not felt like running away for years , though she did sometimes wish to board a ship and sail away and never come back . She worried , now , about Wyatt 's getting a cold . But he would return and probably be better for the experience . As she stood near the sandbox , contemplating the rusting steam shovel half-submerged in a puddle , she imagined herself as an old lady sitting in a front room , baby-sitting her grandchildren , or walking around a large city admiring the statuary . Yes : the day was turning out well , despite the rain . <p> The star in his chest had reappeared in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eugene stopped for a moment to catch his breath and to wait for the sensation to pass . <p> He caught his pants on a bush , and noticed , near some rocks , a patch of wild blueberries that he had missed in his July excursions back here . Now he looked down the hill , past a stream next to which his daughter stood , transfixed by the water or by her broken image in it . She did love to look at herself in objects that reflected her . She had an idea of herself , as they used to say . It was quite consuming , this idea . She would probably marry one of those men with faces like mirrors , Gatsby-men , poisonous and charming . In the distance he saw a rabbit shivering under a pine tree . He aimed his voice toward the bottom of the hill and shouted his son 's name . <p> Gretel said , " Daddy , he 's not here . I want to go home . " Her knees trembled underneath her raincoat . Thunder frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do this . " <p> She turned and ran toward the house , kicking up mud and loose grass . " Tell him hi when you see him , " she shouted over her shoulder , as if Eugene were going on some vacation . Eugene looked back to see her ; in the distance , through the trees , near the top of the hill where the meadow began , Jeanne was standing , looking down toward him . She would not be impressed by any of this . He knew his wife : for her , any form of desperation was suspect . <p> Some of this land belonged to one of his neighbors , a man who owned horses , and Eugene noticed that two of the horses were outside their fences , apparently having jumped them . The horses were neglected , perhaps abused ; he turned away . <p> Another bolt of lightning struck behind him , and Eugene felt the air seared into ozone on either side of him . Retroactively , he jumped . Thor 's bolts : if one hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of the noise made his heart thump . The star burning in his chest was n't his heart , he knew , because he had had his heart recently checked , and he 'd been given a good report . Still trotting along , feeling his hair slicked down by the rain , he found himself thinking about the two horses left out here , loose , jittery , alarmed by the weather . <p> In the distance a few lights from Five Oaks blinked through the apple and pine trees swaying in the wind . Under his feet , fallen apples were mixed in with the first autumn leaves . Eugene lost his footing and fell , his hand landing on an apple . He bit into the apple  --  pleasantly tart , like a living substance  --  and saw , through the wet lenses of his glasses , his son , sitting under a tree in the near distance , his suitcase open , his clothes in tiny neat piles , and his night-light set up on the ground , its cord dangling away loosely . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through again , and his words were swallowed up in the tympanic rumble . <p> Wyatt did n't mind the rain . What he had n't figured on was the shivering , or that his new pair of Keds tennis shoes would get soaked . Maybe it was n't such a good idea , living in the woods . Even with his clothes laid out , it 'd be cold at night and his teeth would chatter , and if there was anything he hated , it was chattering teeth . Wyatt thought of his Aunt Ellen 's house and of how she kept fires going in the living room through most of the fall and winter . He could n't walk that far . But he could n't walk back , either . He 'd have to stay here and figure out how not to shiver . <p> " Wyatt ! " The air had breathed his name , using his father 's voice . The air knew he was out here . He wanted to shout back at it . <p> He turned and saw his father running toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slicked down over his forehead , a stethoscope around his neck , for some reason , and rain covering his glasses so that Wyatt could n't see his eyes . He ran and ran , but in the manner that adults do , so that it was n't rushed . His approach took a long time . His father 's arms were out , came near ; they scooped him up . The stethoscope pressed against him now , after the arms had reached around him and lifted him , and he felt his father 's cold lips press against his cheek , and he was being gathered up now , in this one speeded-up gesture , collected in his father 's arms . It felt as though it had happened several times . He smelled the usual weekend whiskey on his father 's breath and a wet , saggy , furry smell from his father 's wool shirt . Slowly and rapidly , one minute he was by himself and then suddenly here was his father . He huddled against him . He loved his father at moments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad he had run away so that his father had had to chase after him , claim him , and hug him . <p> " Hi , Daddy , " he said . " How come you 've got that doctor 's thing around your neck ? " He knew he would n't be carried like this much longer . He was eight years old . His father would let him down , his arms would weaken , his soaking tennis shoes would make contact with the wet high grass as his father tilted him , feet first , toward the earth . <p> " Wyatt , you 're a wild one . And you 're too heavy , " his father said . " Pack up your things and we 'll go back together . " Then he said , " You gave me a scare . " <p> He ran toward his son unable to see clearly where he was going  --  the rain had dribbled all over his glasses and smeared them  --  and his arms were extended involuntarily toward Wyatt , who was sitting under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of his vision up toward his father 's uncontrolled , rushing progress toward him . With the propulsion given by the hill and the storm , Eugene was running faster than he knew how to run , so that when he reached Wyatt , instead of simply taking his hand , he felt the physical force convert itself into emotional exuberance , and he put his arms under Wyatt and picked him up , and in that moment , the star in his chest , almost a supernova by now , blew apart into planets and planetary dust and debris , floating through his body . The pressure disappeared , as did the pain . Eugene suppressed a groan and lowered his lips to Wyatt 's cheek , and Wyatt exhaled on him a child 's breath smelling of peaches and chocolate . " Hi , Daddy , " he said , as if he 'd been having an adventure of a minor , weekend kind , like hide-and-seek . " How come you 've got that doctor 's thing around your neck ? " <p> Just playing games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavy , and he lowered him to the ground , where he would stay . He had wanted to carry him all the way back to the house , but it was not permitted . " Wyatt , you 're a wild one . And you 're too heavy , " he said , before telling him to pack up his things . <p> Wyatt put his night-light and his clothes back into his suitcase and snapped the locks on it ; then , carrying it in his left hand , his right hand in his father 's , he walked through the apple orchard , up the hill , back toward his house . Two weeks later , at work , Eugene let out a quiet yelp of surprise while sitting at his drafting table  --  he had been designing a gift shop to be built downtown  --  and he drove himself over to the hospital to be examined . They found nothing wrong with him and sent him home . <p> For years , after the funeral three months later and the distribution of his father 's possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was not a birdhouse and had not , in fact , become anything  --  Wyatt would remember the water dripping down on the lenses of his father 's glasses . How could he see anything , with glasses smeared like that ? How did he know how to walk when he could n't tell where he was going ? He must have known how to walk through the blur . And what he also remembered , along with the glasses , was his father 's hand , how wet and chilly it was , as it held on to his own hand , as if his father had come to him from underwater and from very far down , where it must have been unbearably cold . <p> Charles Baxter 's story " Possum " appeared in the May 1991 issue of Harper 's Magazine .
