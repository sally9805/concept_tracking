<p> THE forecast is for afternoon showers , but no such luck . A cold , driving rain chases the morning rush into downtown . <p> Most commuters , shielded by a honeycomb of skywalks , tunnels and parking garages , should hardly be inconvenienced . And in toasty high-rise offices , the city 's cloud-draped panorama merely serves as another mural . <p> Down in the streets , however , reality bikes for a hardy bunch of about 50 . They are downtown bicycle couriers , the descendants of Mercury plying what some call the world 's second-oldest profession : delivering the word from point A to point B , rain or shine . <p> Most are independent contractors working on commission as " " hotshot " messengers for a courier company . They make up to 40 runs a day , many between attorneys and the Harris County Courthouse . <p> The majority are men in their 20s and 30s who see their task more as a way of life than a job , regardless of how long they plan to keep at it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potholes , exhaust fumes , deadlines and the weather . They thrive on physical exertion , and while they spend much of their day visiting button-down offices , they would n't feel comfortable working in one . <p> They rendezvous at the granite wall on Capitol south of the Texas Commerce Bank Tower but are more likely to be seen , satchel draped over the back , flitting through traffic in the central district . They have become as familiar to the downtown landscape as cops on horseback , taxis at hotels and Metros at bus stops . <p> Tim Bleakie , who works for Lawyers ' Filing &; Delivery Service , is at Main and Capitol on this Friday morning wearing a slicker , and shorts , and unlocking his white Italian 12-speed from a signpost . He 's got eight hours in front of him and already everything is open to the slanting rain save the tools of the trade : a two-way radio and a waterproof bag . <p> Bleakie earns $ 300 to $ 400 a week and treasures this as a new career . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit-and-tie life as co-founder and salesman of a bottled water company , sold his car and became a courier . <p> " " I was making $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 a year living the good life before this , " he says , " " but I 'm happier now . " <p> Bleakie joins downscalers from other professions who have simplified - not always voluntarily - their lives . He rents downtown , carries no insurance , eats on the cheap and has few needs or bills . <p> " " You definitely have to manipulate your lifestyle to accommodate making a living down here . It 's a certain amount of being humble , " he says . <p> " " Am I really losing or gaining ? That 's debatable . You come into this world with nothing and you leave with nothing . The key to happiness is to be able to survive without modern conveniences . " <p> Edgar Vasquez , 23 , of Houston Delivery Service , is just passing through on his way to college . " " It 's a pretty good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really want to do , " he says . <p> But beware the allure . Ross Farriols , one of the few women couriers , says , " " It 's the kind of job where you have the idea that you 're only going to do it for a year , and I 'm still down here , four years later . " <p> Perseverance is everything , says the 32-year-old Farriols , who works for Baggage Plus . " " It 's basically the people that turn up everyday and put in the hours . If you 're banged up , you get on your bike and keep going . There 's no relief pitcher . " <p> The veteran is 27-year-old Andrew Medina , who started with Hotshot Messenger Service 10 years ago and now makes more than $ 20,000 annually for Houston Delivery , one of the few services to pay a salary ( $ 7-$ 9 an hour ) and supply health and retirement benefits . <p> Of his survival skills , Medina is modest .

Bleakie 's smile reveals a chipped tooth . <p> " " People get bumped all the time , " says Joel Stockwell , a dispatcher and former courier for Houston Delivery . <p> " " It 's easier to say who has n't ( been hit ) , " says Farriols . <p> There 's even a term for hitting a suddenly opened car door : the door prize . <p> " " Most of us get hurt avoiding accidents , that 's when you go down , " says 25-year-old Russell Brenner of City Central Courier . <p> Those who find it too daunting drop out . " " It is n't so much fun after you 've sucked bus diesel fumes and get hit a few times , " says CitiCouriers general manager Scott Morrison . <p> " " The first two weeks are like a blur down here , " Farriols says of the incessant traffic and maze of intersections , lobbies , elevators , corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But physically rewarding . Bleakie has lost 30 pounds since he started and is lean as a bike frame . Brenner , who abhors deskwork , calls this the next best thing to being a river guide in the Grand Canyon or a ski patrolman in Colorado . <p> And in time , couriers begin to cherish their independence . <p> They 're liberated , they say , from the rat race that zooms all around them . <p> " " When I 'm on my bike , I 'm free , " Bleakie says . <p> " " You come to work and you 're basically doing your own thing all day long , " Stockwell points out . <p> " " I mean , you 're getting paid to ride a bike , " Medina reminds . <p> Getting paid in uncertain times . <p> " " The people ( working ) in these buildings have the same threat against them as I do me , " says Bleakie . " " They 're only as good as yesterday . There 's no such thing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but couriers bond in a fraternity . Thursday nights at Sonora del Norte , a downtown cantina popular with motorcyclists , they appropriate the corner pool table , shoot some stick , drain longnecks , tell lies and blend into the roguish scene of chrome and leather . <p> Weekdays they congregate at " " the tower , " which is central to their companies and clients . Among the characters are those with nicknames like Old School , Scammer , Beeline Bob , Wise Man , the Costa Rica Connection and Code Blue . <p> Always on call , their number fluctuates in a time lapse of whirring spokes and a soundtrack of two-ways . It grows over lunch hour when couriers eat sandwiches from Antone 's across the street or Supreme around the corner . <p> Here , they mingle with all types in the passing parade , sensing they 've got downtown wired . <p> It 's a guy thing and there 's a hierarchy of tenure and " " cool .

" " As soon <p> as they get down here they realize it 's a whole bunch of guys , and they 're not going to change their attitude because there 's a woman around . " <p> " " So she became one of the guys , " Brenner says , beaming . <p> " " You have to be in the mind-set , " Farriols continues , " " that you <p> are going to listen to the locker humor ; that , yes , it does get 100 degrees in the summer ; and that , yes , you are going to get sweaty and your butt 's going to be sore ; and there 's going to be days when you look like hell . And most women do n't like that . They want to look pretty . " <p> The work draws loners and free spirits , even as employers strive for a professional appearance to serve their important client base . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they pride themselves as " " courier scum . " So it is with sweet irony that they enter the inner sanctum of " " bourgeois businessmen " or penthouses of exalted law firms . <p> There , small talk is big ; tact , patience and charm important . <p> " " We think they 're great , " says Marcia Sanders , a receptionist for 18 years for attorney Larry Doherty . <p> Several years ago courier Mike Langdon saved a Fulbright &; Jaworski secretary from a purse snatching , chasing the assailant on his bicycle and pointing him out to a police officer . <p> " " He was a hero around here , " says Kim Blythe , a supervisor . <p> Romance has been known to flare between the couriers and those they meet upstairs . <p> " " I guess they like the appeal of us coming in all pumped up , " Brenner says of the reaction from some women . " " I ca n't think of a better place to meet women , unless you were working on a cruise ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional , Sanders says . " " They have to be very quick . They 're fast , they 're friendly , and they 're out of here . " <p> Yet Karen McGhee , general manager of Houston Delivery , cautions that , " " You want them to also be careful because we do so much detail-oriented work . " <p> Those who know law terminology and can finesse their way around the courthouse are highly regarded . Bleakie has so much access he was once mistaken for a judge 's son . <p> On this Friday , the " kaTHUNK " of file stamps reverberates in Central Intake at the courthouse as couriers file documents . <p> " " You 've got to be careful , man , " says Medina , leafing through pages and inserting a select few into the stamp . " " You do n't get something filed in time , or filed correctly , you can cost somebody millions , literally , or several thousand . So it hinges on us , even if an attorney gives us eight minutes to get down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are privy to attorney strategy , and their perspective of the justice system is informed by hours of observation . <p> It 's enough to make one pause . <p> " " You see so much human element down here , " Bleakie says , " " from <p> judges to prisoners and everything in between . It gets kind of sad , but I doubt it will improve because I think mankind is becoming uncivilized . " <p> At Shirar 's Bicycle Shop on Fannin , James Turner fetches a photoboard depicting the 83-year history of the family-run business . Western Union employees , with their oversize bicycles , occupy one shot , taken in 1912 when the store was on Market Square . <p> Businesses have long had in-house runners ; UPS is the latest to implement bikes downtown . <p> But the courier industry , which began in New York City , is relatively new here . A few firms opened in the ' 70s using automobiles and " " downtown walkers . " <p> Bikes turned up as a cheaper alternative to cars in the early ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bikes fit Houston 's moderate winters , flat terrain and compact downtown grid . <p> Most couriers then used quick , lightweight multispeed road bikes . The heavier and more durable mountain bikes common today appeared in 1986 , although some couriers own road models for recreation or competition . <p> The ideal courier ride , says Bleakie , would combine the thicker wheels and stronger braking system of a mountain bike with the agility of a road bike . <p> " " It 's a fine line between riding a cheap beater and something that 's too good , " says Farriols . " " Bikes will die down here . " And get stolen . U-locks are relatively effective , and the maxim is the lighter ( and therefore better ) the bike , the heavier the lock . <p> To couriers , their bike is a companion . <p> " " My bike is like my wife , " says Bleakie . " " It takes me everywhere I want to go , takes me home when I drink , does n't talk back , always does exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " <p> Bleakie does his own maintenance and goes through several sets of tires a year . Other expenses include patch kits , air pumps , water bottles , rain-proof Gortex socks ( $ 40 a pair ) and shoulder bags - Santa Barbara 's Jandd or San Francisco 's Timbuk 2 . Their employers supply pagers , radios , jerseys , raingear and helmets . <p> Some companies mandate helmets . Bleakie 's does n't , and he 's one of the few to ride without . <p> " " If I was to die on my bicycle , there would not be any more fitting way for me to go . " <p> He 's almost fatalistic about it , but offers practical reasons , too . " " A helmet changes my hearing , and I do a lot of riding with my ears , especially with stuff behind me . You change that perception , you could almost cause yourself an accident where you need a helmet . " <p> The rain is falling harder after lunch , which means Bleakie will eventually have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motorola radio are protected under his poncho , but his bare legs are soaked ; bike messengers do n't wear anything so " " restrictive " as long pants until it 's below 40 degrees . Then , a pair of tights or even long underwear will do . <p> " " You may look like Jed Clampett , but by God your thighs are warm , " Bleakie said . <p> Bleakie acts as a weatherman to office personnel , most of whom sympathize with his soggy countenance . But an old courier bromide says if you 're going to get wet , you might as well make money . <p> By 3:30 he had pedaled to 1111 Bagby , to St. Thomas University in Montrose , the Houston Club , the downtown post office , back to Lawyers ' Filing at Capitol and Main , over to Fulbright &; Jaworski at One Houston Center , to three addresses on McKinney , down to the courthouse , over to 1415 Louisiana , out to 3200 Travis , to Doherty &; Wagner at 2225 LaBranch , back to the Montrose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back to the courthouse . <p> And this is a slow day , eventually totaling 17 miles and $ 67 . <p> Bleakie radios dispatcher Mike Fuentes in the office . <p> " " Twenty-one to base , " he checks in , ducking under an awning or inside a stairwell . <p> Teamwork is essential . Fuentes orchestrates relays between couriers and company drivers for deliveries connecting downtown and outlying areas . He who makes the delivery keeps the commission ; it 's just too much of a hassle to split everything , and , by the courier code , everything sort of evens out . <p> Bleakie gets 55 percent of all delivery fees , of which today 's largest is $ 8.50 to St. Thomas . Most are $ 2.50 to $ 5.50 . The real money is in the $ 20 night rate , which all goes to Bleakie for runs after 5 . He is paid every other Friday . <p> He generally obeys traffic laws ; the city regards bikes as motorized vehicles . Speeds reach 15 mph on this rainy day ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoplights on north-south arteries . <p> Brenner says couriers get a bad name from " " rookies that come down here and ride down the wrong way , run stop lights . " <p> The police periodically crack down , but the relationship has improved , couriers say , since HPD instituted its downtown bike patrol . The two factions occasionally cross paths at Shirar 's shop , where Turner says they are beginning to communicate . <p> Opinion is divided about the profession 's future . Business has been hurt by fax and e-mail , but technology 's reach is limited . The courthouse needs original documents , and Morrison at CitiCouriers says lawyers , a distrustful lot , fear security breaches in phone lines and cyberspace . <p> The busiest period is in spring leading up to tax day , the slowest is summer . Regardless , Bleakie is n't the worrying kind . " " If you 're in the right place at the right time , you get the work . It 's a roll of the dice . " <p> And if you lose , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your life to smell the roses . If you make life a dog race , you 're chasing a rabbit and it 's not even real . "
