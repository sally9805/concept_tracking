This Three-peat Bull Picks Stocks for 25% Gains . " That headline ran above our September 1993 profile of Harvey Bundy , 50 , research chief at William Blair &; Co. , the carriage-trade stockbroker in Chicago . Boy , was he off the mark . The portfolio of six unheralded growth stocks that he recommended a year ago actually rose 51% vs. the Dow 's 6% gain ( see left ) . One lucky call ? No way . In our November 1992 issue , Bundy picked six other growth stocks that increased 59% as a group ( vs. the Dow 's 8% ) . And in the November 1990 issue , he selected five stocks to excel over the next 24 months . Bingo . The five as a group more than doubled , returning 116% , vs. the market 's 33% . The source for Bundy 's picks this month , as well as those past winners , is Blair 's Current Better Values list of stock recommendations . Since mid-1976 , the firm 's 20 analysts have created 110 such portfolios of 10 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat the market over the next 24 months . The overall two-year profit on the 98 lists that have reached maturity is an awesome 49% , vs. the Dow 's 20% . The secret ? " Nothing focuses a analyst 's mind more than being tied to a pick for the seeming eternity of two years , " deadpans Bundy . At MONEY 's request , Bundy again winnowed down his current list of 14 stocks to six he 's confident can deliver earnings growth  --  the best proxy of a stock 's appreciation potential  --  averaging 23% annually through 1997 . That 's triple the 7% rate he forecasts for the S &P; 500 companies ( see the table below ) . ( table omitted ) Another reassuring trait : All of his picks are heavily owned by corporate insiders . CDW Computer Centers ( ticker symbol : CDWC ; lately $20 ; insiders own 68% of the stock ) . During the past five years , sales of this mail-order computer emporium have soared 47% annually to $329 million . " CDW ( Computer Discount Warehouse ) has developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high levels of service for clients knowledgeable enough to buy direct , " explains Bundy . Indeed , he , was a loyal customer of the Buffalo Grove , Ill. firm , founded 12 years ago by chairman Michael Krasny , 40 , before Blair brought it public in 1993 at $12.50 a share . Bundy says Krasny is so efficiency-conscious that sales per employee approach $1.2 million , vs. $330,000 for $500 million rival Micro Warehouse . Bundy figures CDW 's profits will surge 32% this year , then compound 25% annually through 1997 . Loewen Group ( LWNGF ; $24 ; insiders own 21% ) . In the past decade , sales of Loewen , based near Vancouver , have shot up 53% annually to $425 million ( ' 94 estimate ) . The impetus ? Bundy says the company is the pacesetter in a fast-consolidating field  --  funeral homes owned by mom-and-pop firms that often seek a partner like Loewen to ensure continuation of the business after their retirement . In 1994 , Bundy expects such acquisitions to boost funeral homes run by the firm 17% to 625 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's counting on profits rising 32% this year , then 25% annually over the next three . Chairman Ray Loewen , 54 , founder of the firm in 1986 , is upbeat too . He recently paid an average of $23 each for 500,000 shares ( adding to his 7.8-million-share ante ) . Bombay Co . ( BBA ; $11 ; insiders own 9% ) . Bundy notes that fiscal ' 94 sales of this Fort Worth chain of 450 home furnishing outlets hit $317 million , up a brisk 37% . The big attraction , he says , is affordable knockoffs of 18th-and 19th-century English furniture and accessories sold in malls with money-back guarantees . So why 's the stock down 55% from its $32 high last February ? Bombay , he explains , was last year 's darling among Wall Street 's so-called momentum players who pile into stocks with rapidly accelerating earnings and bail out en masse when growth rates inevitably slow , as Bombay 's have lately , from 30% a year to 25% . " We believe Bombay can sustain that 25% clip over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we 're right , the stock should sell for at least 25 times next year 's earnings , not its current 15 multiple . " OEA Ine . ( OEA ; $30 ; insiders own 38% ) . This $110 million Denver company , which chairman Ahmed Kafadar , 79 , started as a defense contractor in 1957 , has a dominant 60% share of the bustling $125 million world market for gizmos that trigger auto air bags . Bundy says that OEA also leads in a new type of inflator for passenger-side air bags that figures to quadruple the firm 's revenues per bag to around $30 . He adds : " OEA already has orders for 3 million such units in model-year ' 96 . " ( Global air-bag production in ' 94 should top 23 million , double the total two years ago . ) And some ' 97 Detroit cars will offer side-impact bags , which Bundy expects will quickly catch on here and abroad . He 's betting that OEA 's earnings will jump 28% in fiscal ' 95 and compound 21% annually through ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insiders own 43% ) . If you liked undertaker Loewen , says Bundy , you 'll love this fast-expanding $90 million Scottsdale , Ariz. concern that Blair brought public in 1993 at $12.50 a share . Founded in 1948 as a private fire department ( such services still account for a third of revenues ) , Rural/Metro is now a big acquirer of complementary ambulance companies in six states , including Florida , New York and Texas . The huge , $4 billion ambulance business is highly fragmented among 10,000 operators and growing 10% a year in step with the aging of America , says Bundy . He adds : " We 're convinced Rural/Metro can expand twice that fast , or 20% , via increased acquisitions as well as privatizations of services run by cities . " MGI Pharma ( MOGN ; $11 ; insiders own 36% ) . Bundy 's list rarely sports tiny drugmakers such as this $4 million Minneapolis firm . They tend to be unprofitable , too pricey  --  or both . But he thinks MGI is an overlooked gem that will make money next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer patients in radiation therapy . The drug was approved by regulators in March and has potential U.S. sales of $40 million by 1996 . " Yet the stock sells for a scant 10 times our ' 96 earnings estimate , " adds Bundy , " because upstart drug firms are now out of fashion . " THESE WINNERS MAY KEEP GOING Star analyst Harvey Bundy of William Blair remains confident about five of the six low-profile stocks that gained an average of 51% since he recommended them in MONEY a year ago . ( One of those picks , software house ChipSoft , was acquired in December by Intuit at $17 a share , a three-month profit of 70% . ) The five are led by Day Runner ( symbol DAYR ; lately up 100% to $18 ) , a $71 million ( annual sales ) marketer of diaries and organizers . Other picks that trounced the Dow 's 6% rise are $102 million medical firm Omnicare ( OCR ; up 95% to $37 ) ; $270 million retailer Sports &; Recreation ( SPRC ; up 38% to $33 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $33 ) , which rents and cleans uniforms . What about his lone loser , Concord EFS ( CEFT ) , down 15% to $26 ? Not to worry , says Bundy . He sees this $80 million supplier of check verification and credit-card processing to retailers quickly recovering from a recent earnings slowdown and growing 25% annually through 1997 . <p>
