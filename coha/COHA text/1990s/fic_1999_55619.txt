THE ONLY THING MADAME TAMMY SAID that may have been overheard went something like , " Oh , hell , it does n't matter  --  I 'll take paper . " She stood in line at a regular checkout aisle in a Winn-Dixie halfway between Charlotte and Atlanta . Fifty customers stood in the 10 Items or Less line . Tammy only bought a roll of paper towels , some fingernail-polish remover , Jewish rye , and pimiento cheese , though she stood between two women with full carts . She held a twenty-dollar bill . It was noon , and Tammy had just read a hundred palms at the Monday/ Thursday Chesnee flea market near the North Carolina border , in peach and apple country . <p> " You sound exactly like my dead sister , " this woman said , pushing her full cart into Tammy 's backside . " I ai n't never heard nothing like that . Say this : I will never , ever order a club sandwich here with bacon again , what with the ptomaine . ' Say it . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore the black turban and smock , the golden spangles and half-moons . She stood six feet tall and raised one eyebrow for emphasis . The woman behind her kept putting groceries on the belt : white bread , frozen dinner-rolls , a slew of Vienna sausages , potted meat , Spam , diapers for both kids and adults . " Club sandwich ptomaine , " Tammy said . <p> " Hot damn , " said the woman . " It 's as if my sister spoke from the grave . " The cashier gave Tammy her change . " It 's the last thing I ever heard her say . She ate a bad sandwich over at this little place best known for its barbecue , she made herself known how she felt about the food , and then she died later on that afternoon . " <p> The cashier said , " Do you want one of the game pieces in order to see if you can win a million dollars instantly , or save them up for weekly bargains ? " <p> Madame Tammy said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like getting my hopes up . " She stepped forward and took her one sack . <p> The woman behind Tammy held out her hand for the tiny perforated-cardboard square . " Listen , I 'll pay you to let my little niece call you up and say something . If you 'll just talk to her a bit . She keeps wanting to call up her momma in heaven and all , and me and my husband-we got custody now  --  we do n't know how to handle it . We just do n't know . We do n't . It 's hard explaining some things . " Tammy turned around and nodded , though she just wanted out of there . <p> The cashier , sliding items across the Magic Eye , looked back and forth between them . Between blips she said , " My mother died when I was twelve . I 'd just about forgotten what she sounded like until one day the TV was on and this lady was doing a commercial for getting your credit fixed . It sounded just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it in Hollywood , seeing as I could n't take hearing that voice once a week or nothing . It was just a local commercial , though . " <p> A two-for-a-dollar frozen pizza did n't connect . The cashier kept running a flat box of sausage topping over the eye . " Well , " Tammy said . " I 'm not around much . And my brother 's coming to stay with me a while . What would I say ? " <p> The woman said to the cashier , " They 're two for a dollar . Just ring the goddamn thing in It 's written on a big orange thing there . Just ring it in . " <p> " Store policy , " said the cashier . She had braces , and some boy 's high-school ring on her index finger . Tammy thought she did n't look more than twelve , and remembered how she felt when her own father left some three decades earlier . <p> The pizza clicked finally . Tammy said , " Sure . Tell your niece to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out a business card . It had an eyeball on an open palm . " Since I 'm not there most of the time you might tell your niece that the payphone 's pretty busy up in heaven , in case she ca n't get through . " <p> The woman said , " Her name 's Edwina , but we call her Eddie . She 's a special child . We call her Special Eddie . Listen . You ai n't got an answering machine , do you ? That might confuse her  --  why her momma wo n't pick up . Hey , do this : change your message . I 'll pay you and all . " <p> Tammy nodded . She did n't ask the woman how they would get together for payments and so on . " I 'll do what I can do . And I can do , I promise . " She did n't go into details about how she searched every day for her own father at flea markets across America . <p> Madame Tammy did n't want a roommate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a list of needs longer than a desert turtle 's lifeline . She had to buy rubber-soled boots , seeing as a man selling stolen rebar at the table next to her got hit by lightning last Wednesday down at the Pickens County flea market . She needed to hire a new gofer  --  the school year had started , and she no longer had a fifteen-year-old to depend on  --  to scour the various markets she worked , in search of old men selling used golf balls . Madame Tammy needed to take the only snapshot she owned of her father , Shorty , and get it touched up by one of those photographers who filled in cracks , tears , and fades . She felt certain her father did n't do stunt work in Hollywood like he wrote in those couple letters thirty years before ; though she was n't a true psychic , she felt certain he still dove , nights , into dark , still water hazards , retrieved duffers ' errant approach shots , and cleaned them up for resale . <p> Madame Tammy needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and replenish herself with hope . Her father neared sixty  --  and if indeed he 'd done stunt work after leaving the family , then chances were he would n't live much longer . <p> " I do n't have room for anyone , Lamar , " she told her brother . " I live in a little place . I 'm hardly here , too . Hell , I live in the back of my van more often than not . " Right away Tammy thought how most people might 've said , " If you 're hardly there , then you wo n't notice me . " It was n't that she felt embarrassed about her living conditions between flea markets  --  she owned a vertical , three-storey , 1,500-square-foot house on top of Tryon Peak , near the South Carolina/North Carolina border . Some days she referred to the house as the Tower . After particularly fruitful market days , she called it the Steeple . <p> Lamar used a phone card to call her . He was already in Opelika , trying to stay off Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This thing only lasts ten minutes . Look , I just need a few days  --  a week at most . " <p> Madame Tammy was n't embarrassed about working flea markets , either . She knew that most people-especially wives  --  thought she said things like , " For twenty dollars I can tell you that you 'll get your next blowjob in five minutes . " In reality , perhaps that was better than her real modus operandi , namely finding answers about family , commitment , and medical history , among other things . At flea markets all over the Southeast , adults walked past her table with anxious or hostile looks , unable to whisper , " Whore , " or " Nutcase , " or " Gypsy . " <p> " If you come up here for a week , then you better bring something to sell , " Tammy told Lamar . " I 'm not going to put up with another free-loading man who wants to spend time in my Tower while I work my tail off holding fat , callused hands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got a happy long life ahead of them . " <p> Lamar said , " We have n't seen each other since you moved up there for good , Sis . " <p> Madame Tammy looked out her front window . In the winter , sometimes , she swore she saw the Atlantic Ocean , some three hundred miles away . " Why are n't you teaching ? Should n't school be starting down there by now ? I lost my boy who used to look around the markets and jockey lots for me . " <p> The mechanical operator came on and said , " You have one minute . " <p> Lamar said , " Parents in Montgomery , Alabama , do n't have much sense of humor . There are n't any students left in all of America who understand sarcasm or irony , either . " <p> The phone beeped in a series . Tammy said , " Well , come on , then . If I 'm not here , I 'll leave a note where you can get me . The door 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she spoke to dead air , and hung up . Tammy waited ten minutes for the phone to ring  --  long enough for Lamar to go buy another phone card . It did n't , and she went out the door . She carried two pictures that needed refurbishing . One showed her mother and father together , in front of a Buick . Her mother wore a cotton dress with some kind of pattern on it . Her father wore suspenders and had his hair slicked back in a way that heightened the receding hairline . <p> The other photograph was a black-and-white closeup of her father 's palm , and the scar that ran from the meat of his thumb to between his index and middle fingers . Initially it was to be used as evidence in a court case involving an inferior and spastic spinning frame in the cotton mill where Shorty worked , later as documentation for workman 's comp , Tammy 's father left town before he could find a lawyer to help him out . He left after shooting a wealthy man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . <p> The details did n't matter . After college , and after two misguided marriages , Tammy decided to find her father , and not because of every other human being on one of the afternoon talk shows . She would know him by his scars only . She read a book on the finer points of palmistry , rented five-dollar flea market tables soon thereafter . When a desperate client had malformed lines , Madame Tammy made up only good news , smiled , and told the person he or she had nothing to worry about whatsoever . <p> She had made up good news for her brother , too , when he took a job teaching tenth-grade geometry in Montgomery . And though she did n't truly believe she had psychic abilities , Madame Tammy knew she would have to lie to Lamar again . Then there would be the problem of offering the truth , too . <p> " Seems to me Jesus of Nazareth could 've done better than turning water into wine . He could 've done something a little more spectacular , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivy into wine . Hell , why did n't He turn Satan into wine ? All your people say that booze is the devil 's doing in the first place . " These are the words that got Madame Tammy 's brother Lamar fired . <p> " I do n't understand why you 'd bring religion up in a math class , " Tammy said . He 'd not even had time to bring in his couple suitcases , or the boxes in the back of his car . Lamar did n't arrive until three days after calling from eastern Alabama . Because he could n't think of anything else , he spent nights diving into country club water hazards and collecting golf balls to have something to sell at the flea markets . <p> " Beats me , too , " Lamar replied . " I 'll tell you this : the parents did n't understand , obviously , and down there no one thinks to ever have a respectable hearing , trial , or closed-door conference . I said that shit about Jesus on a Friday afternoon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my classroom on Saturday morning . " <p> " Like father , like son , as they say . " <p> Lamar reached in his pocket and pulled out a hip flask . " You can do better than that , Tammy , " he said . " All that goddamn comparative lit. education you got , you can come up with something better than a cliche . " He laughed , took a swig , and handed the flask over . <p> Madame Tammy shook her head no . " OK . Where the salmon spawn and die , there the next-generation salmon spawn and die . Whatever . Listen , you can either sleep on this couch , or on the floor , or in the hammock outside . You can stay a month . Then you have to go back home . That 's the law around here . I read it somewhere . No one can stay with his or her grown sibling for more than a month . " <p> Lamar said , " I did n't come to get lectured . And I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'll hold it somewhere between thirty and ninety days . I do n't have to wait until I 'm sixty-five or anything , like in some of the backwards , unrelenting , selfish states . I do n't want to be a burden . I just needed to get out . I 'll tell you later . " <p> Madame Tammy said , " I hope this does n't have anything to do with one of your students , Lamar . " <p> " I thought you were some kind of psychic . Should n't you know ? " He drank from the flask . " I 'm just kidding . It 's Fermat 's Last Theorem . Some pinhead figured it out , so there 's no more reason to live in mathematics , as far as I 'm concerned . Computers , too  --  there 's no need to stand in front of a chalkboard . Some people think the universe is governed by mathematics and whatnot . When I said all that stuff about Jesus in class , it was my way of being mathematical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two points , I was being religious . Fuck it . " <p> Lamar brought in his clothes . He took his sister down the mountain to eat at a family-operated pool hall/bar/pizza joint called Shots and Slices . After Tammy beat him in their first game of nine-ball , Lamar said , " I guess living up here kind of insulates you from undergoing another bad marriage . " <p> Tammy said , " I like these people . It 's also a central point for flea markets between mid-Florida and northern Virginia . I made a big mistake going out to New Mexico one time , lost my mind , and came back . Do n't give me shit , especially after all you 've done . " <p> Lamar reracked the balls while Tammy went to order a large , odd pizza  --  anchovies and pineapple . Lamar looked at the walls  --  pictures of people standing at wooden tables , everything from milk glass to measuring devices in front of them . When Tammy came back , he said , " I know it 's your business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't you take notes and write some kind of scholarly work about it ? Something with an anthropological slant ? I bet it 'd sell . I do n't know . Give it a racy title . Call it Hand lobs in America or something . " <p> Tammy broke , and the nine ball swerved into a side pocket . " You owe everyone in here a drink . That 's the house rules . Listen , I only want to see our father one last time . It 's not so much that I feel unwhole because he left us so early on . I ca n't explain it . " <p> " What 'll you do if you find him ? " Lamar asked . <p> " Shoot him twice , " Madame Tammy said . " I 'll have a scotch and Dr Pepper . Do n't make fun of me or I 'll tell you the truth about your love line . " <p> Tammy 's friend Fagen placed two quarters on the table . He said , " Are y'allses playing for fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coonskin hat without the tail . He kept a knife attached to his belt . <p> Tammy said , " Hey , there , Clarence Fagen . How you doing today ? " She slipped up on the pool table and let her legs dangle . <p> Fagen smiled halfway . " Same old same old . Man 's got to do what a man 's got to do . Ca n't complain . " <p> Tammy pointed at Lamar and said , " This here 's my brother the mathematician . Or ex-mathematician . He ai n't quite the same as us . To him , six hours equals six hours . " <p> Lamar did n't know what that meant . He stuck out his hand and said , " I 'm Lamar . Good to meet you . " <p> Fagen said , " Fagen . " He nodded . " Say , If you 're a mathematician then I guess you know that hundred to one odds is pretty good . I 'll bet you a thousand dollars to your ten that you 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fagen turned to Madame Tammy and asked , " Any luck finding your daddy 's hand ? " <p> Lamar did n't like his sister 's choice of lifestyle , friends , or secrecy . Tammy warned , " Do n't bet him , Lamar . Fagen wears a drainage bag and pees down his leg all the time into the thing . He acts like he never has to pee . " <p> Lamar thought this : x times y equals xy . He thought , 3.14159265 , but could go no further . <p> Fagen said , " Damn , " and took his two quarters of the table . " If you going to be that way , then I do n't want to play no more . " <p> " Fagen sells pelts , " Tammy told Lamar . " He sells pelts and keeps an eye out for his daughter . She 'd be about what now , Fagen  --  eighteen ? " <p> " Eighteen going on nineteen . Unless she 's exactly like her momma . Then she 'd be eighteen going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Fagen 's wife took off with their daughter ten years ago . The mother had a thing about fur coats , and Fagen here figures **25;1079;TOOLONG . He thinks he 'll eventually find her wanting to buy ten or twelve rabbit skins to sew together into something . " <p> Lamar said , " Huh . " He rolled the cue ball to the other end of the table , but not hard enough for it to return . A song came out of the jukebox that sounded like the soundtrack to a foreign wedding-Italian , Jewish , or Greek  --  which caused a couple boys to pull out their quarters and get the thing back to country music . <p> Fagen 's eyes rolled back somewhat . Lamar figured the guy was pissing into his bag . " The last thing I heard my wile say was that she wanted to find a man who could set her down on a mink couch , drive her around in a car with sheepskin seats . " <p> Lamar said , " Logic 's a tricky thing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own dad had a love for selling golf balls at the flea market , and I imagine that Tammy here will find him doing the same one day . It makes sense that you 'll find either your ex-wife or daughter looking for cheap fur . Shit , I remember when I was a kid , my father would take me out at midnight and we'd. dive into golf course lakes . I 'd scoop out balls with my forearms , and then later on he 'd clean them up in Clorox . Then we 'd set up a table on Saturday mornings with some kind of dirty sign , something like ' Look at These Scarless Bails , ' or ' Our Balls Still Have Bounce . ' It was n't the best time of my life , but I guess it made me who I am today . Tammy did n't have to put up with all that back then . " <p> Fagen drank his beer . He placed the bottle on a foldout wooden chair . " The sign said ' Our Used Balls Still Have Dimples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She tode me . If I was you , I 'd get over it . Seems to me your sister has more bruises than you do about your daddy taking off . You want to hep her out , take some balls to the tables and sell them a dollar a dozen . Sooner or later your daddy 'll come up to buy you out so 's he ai n't got competition . " <p> " Come on now , Fagen , " Tammy said . " We 're out having fun . " She racked the bails for a game of eight-ball . <p> Lamar said , " I 'm not judging anybody , man . " <p> Fagen said , " You right . I 'm sorry . " He turned to select a stick . His belt was one of those with a name branded on the back . His said " Leonard . " <p> Lamar chalked his cue and raised his eyebrows to Tammy . " I started a tab up there . If you want another scotch and Dr Pepper , just go put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick for warp . He said , " What do you think the chances are that someone could break , and then all the bails come right back to where they were ? I 'm talking , what are the chances that a man could knock hell out of the balls , have them scatter and ricochet all over the table , then land right back where they were racked , in the same order ? " <p> Lamar said , " Not very good . " <p> Fagen said , " I did n't think so . " He broke . The two ball went in . Fagen said , " I guess it was n't meant for me to do it a third time . " <p> " When we 're not sitting behind flea market tables looking everybody in the face  --  or in your sister 's case , on the hand  --  then we 're at bars . When we 're not in bars , we 're at diners  --  Waffle Houses , Huddle Houses , American Waffle . When we 're not eating or drinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for do n't go to movie theaters ; they go to drive-ins . They do n't go down to Atlanta to watch the Braves ; they sit in the front rows of professional wrestling . " Fagen kept looking at the side pocket . <p> Lamar said , " How come you got ' Leonard ' written on the back of your belt ? " <p> " When we 're not in bars , diners , drive-ins , or wrestling matches , tend to drive around looking for people with car trouble . And I 'm not talking about the interstates . The people we 're looking for always take back roads , secondary roads . You ever looked at a Rand McNally and seen those little vacant lines where roads are going to be ? That 's where my daughter is now . That 's where your father is . I 'd almost bet that your father is with my daughter . I ought to kill you right now , just for mentioning it . " <p> Fagen shot , The cue ball bounced around and knocked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bought it cheap from a man down on his luck , " Fagen said . " Did n't buy it from a man named Leonard , though . Bought it from a man named Eugene . Eugene got it from a man named Benny . Benny got it from Leonard in some kind of bar fight . I do n't know . Benny had a lot of belts he sold to Eugene . He had one that said Cassius Clay . Eugene promised that Benny used to be a contender , in a way . " <p> Lamar thought , Maurice Frechet came up with the idea of metric space in the year 1906 . He thought , The tree roots of mathematics are algebra , plane geometry , trig , analytic geometry , and irrational numbers , The capital of Alabama is Montgomery . " I bet that might be worth something . Cassius Clay . I 'll be damned . " <p> Tammy came back with a round for everyone . She said , " Y'all did n't wait for me ? We could 've played cutthroat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , We are . <p> " I met a man one time said he fought Rocky Graziano . Not Rocky Marciano . Graziano . Said he fought him when Graziano was finished , after he 'd quit fighting professional . They got in an altercation in a bar , like men tend to do . This old boy had a scar on his face shaped like an arrowhead . I believed him . Graziano had a way to twist his boxing glove twice on the skin before anyone knew what hit . He was one of them people who could pull out your heart while it still beat , I bet . " Fagen shot hard into the far bank , hitting nothing . " Take over , Tammy . A couple boys just come in thinking they got good kidneys . " He handed her his cue . <p> Fagen stared down Lamar , then winked . Lamar noticed the arrowhead-shaped scar beneath his left eye . " Is everyone in the flea market business a scam artist ? This is like a foreign film . Goddamn , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my frame , " Lamar said . <p> " Your food 's ready , Tammy , " someone yelled from the other room . <p> Tammy set her stick on the table and looked at her watch . " We better take this to-go . It 's late . We have to get up at four to get good tables at the market down in Pickens . " <p> Lamar said , " That 's no problem . Sometimes I wake up at three and find myself going over square roots . " <p> Lamar slept on the floor . When the telephone rang an hour into his sleep-when there was a pause before some child asked him if he was God  --  he said , " What 's with you people ? Tell your mother to find a reason to live , outside bothering me at all hours of the day and night . " <p> The child said , " This is Eddie . I 'm calling Momma ? " <p> Lamar sat up and reached for his cigarettes . " Are you from Montgomery ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Are you Jesus ? " <p> Lamar stood up . He said , " This is n't funny anymore , lady , " and hung up . <p> Tammy took a bottle of vodka from the shelf and poured it into three flasks . She shook a half-gallon of orange juice , then poured it into a Coleman camping thermos . She stretched her fingers back and forth . <p> Lamar rolled over on the floor , five feet away from the refrigerator . " I had the worst dreams of my life . I must 've woke up every five minutes . I know where our father is . He 's in a telephone booth somewhere fucking with us . That 's what I dreamt . " <p> Tammy said , " We need to leave in twenty minutes . If you want to sell golf balls you might want to take a shower . If you want to mill around with the people , do n't bother . It 's going to be hot today . " <p> " Somebody called up last night and messed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet these days . They found me . All my parents down in Montgomery found me . They called and kept asking if I was God or Jesus . You do n't have some kind of weird 1-900 number , do you ? You do n't have some kind of sex number where you talk dirty to women and say you 're God , do you ? " <p> Tammy put down the thermos . " Fuck . Fuck , fuck , fuck . I forgot . " Lamar did two sit-ups and got up . " I met this woman at the store . " She went to the phone and hit *69 . <p> Tammy memorized the number , called back , and got an answering machine . It was four in the morning . Aunt Jojo 's voice said , " Way to go , You better find plain Eddie 's momma so she can leave a message for her little girl . " <p> Tammy felt her face redden . She waited until the beep , then said , " Hey , honey , It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry I missed your call . Please call me back between five and six o'clock tonight . I 'll be here . " Tammy spoke as if she tried to lure a stray dog toward her . She looked at Lamar . He shrugged , then took one of the flasks and drank from it . " Sometimes the devil is able to tap into our phone lines here , and that 's what happened last night . But do n't worry about me , and remember that I love you . " <p> " It 's OK to drink at the flea market ? " Lamar asked . " I do n't remember Dad ever drinking behind the table . " <p> " That 's the difference between a man who believes in nothing and a man who still has hope , Lamar . Goddamn you , play along every once in a while . The one thing you have to learn at the flea market is that you have to play along with people . " <p> " What 'd I do ? What the hell , was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't a good start to the day .

God 's going to come down on me for what you 've done , Lamar . I bet you a dollar not one person wants a palm read today . " <p> Lamar put the flask in his hip pocket . " Listen . If you multiply two negatives you get a positive . That 's all I have to say . When something goes wrong in my life , I just try to find another negative . Then everything 's back to normal . " He bounced his head up and down like some kind of sideways metronome . <p> Madame Tammy reached down , squeezed his testicles , and said , " This is what our daddy used to do to me back when I was n't but six years old . It 's OK , understand : I 'm not mad about it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rolled fist . " Well . I guess that 's the kind of negative you ca n't double . " When Tammy showered he hit redial , got plain Eddie 's Aunt Jojo 's answering machine , and said , " This is Saint Peter . I 'm the gatekeeper guy . You can see your mother in person at the flea market this morning . I 'm in charge of letting people in or out , and your mom 's going to be out . " <p> Lamar did n't think to steal egg cartons from behind a Bi-Lo , Winn-Dixie , Food Lion , or Harris-Teeter so he could display his unwashed golf balls to the public . The eight-by-four-foot tables at the Pickens Country flea market were made up of one-by-four pine strips , with an inch between the boards . Lamar set his balls down in rows and hoped the wind did n't blow them away . <p> " You do n't know me , " Tammy said . She shone her flashlight in his face . " No matter what happens , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't come over the boundary , Lamar . " She dragged her pointy shoe on the red clay ; <p> Tammy kept a fake crystal ball and real tarot cards on her table . They were across from Fagen with his pelts , and a guy named Weigel , who seemed to specialize in alligator heads and turtle shells . Weigel kept saying , " Snappa , snappa , snappa , snappa , " when people walked by shining their flashlights on his products . <p> " Golf balls , golf balls , " Lamar said . <p> Madame Tammy did n't talk . <p> " When it 's dark , we want light . When it 's light , we want cloud coverage , " Fagen said . " When the woman comes by wanting table rent , we wish we were invisible . " <p> Lamar laughed . He pointed at Fagen and said , " Listen to this  --  the summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral are equal . Dig : the line joining the midpoints of the equal sides of a Saccheri quadrilateral is perpendicular to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Fagen held one rabbit pelt in midair before setting it down . " You talk like that to regular people , boy , you wo n't sell your balls . " <p> Tammy did n't hold her hands together as if in prayer or anything , but she kept her head down and seemed to concentrate . She said , " Lamar , you 've turned into an idiot . Please do n't tell me that you 're an idiot . " <p> Weigel said , " There 's a difference between a crocodile and an alligator . I 've seen gators . I go down to Florida and kill me alligators every winter . I do n't go to Africa for crocodiles . That 's where crocodiles live . In Africa . They got different noses and teeth . They 're different . " <p> Fagen walked away from his table and said , " This is Tammy 's brother . You ai n't got to sell him . He knows you ai n't ever wrestled a real alligator . " <p> The sun nudged its Way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Lamar barked . He 'd been to flea markets over the years and knew the going rate was four for a dollar , at best . Already people walked the tables , mostly antique dealers looking for cheap yellow-ware or stolen service-station signs . Lamar said to everyone who came by , " If you see another guy selling golf balls , tell him I 'll sell my entire stock for twenty bucks . " It seemed the quickest way to lure his father . <p> Tammy looked up at the fading stars . Fagen advised , " Do n't sell off all your stock at once , Lamar . If you do , you 'll end up sitting at an empty table . If you leave , some asshole wanting to get rid of his pit bull puppies will show up , and no one can sell with pit bulls in the vicinity , I swear . " <p> Lamar handed Fagen the flask . " Oh , I got more balls in the van . I 'm just saying that . I got it under control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision wherein you need to go find another job teaching mathematics , far , far away . I 'm having a vision that there are geometry-deprived students in Alaska , Lamar . " <p> By eight o'clock  --  not two hours into daylight-no other golf ball dealer had taken Lamar 's bait . He 'd sold a few dozen , though , and after the woman came by wanting the table rent , Lamar stood only two dollars in the hole . He did n't respond to Weigel or Fagen when they remarked how it was probably a good thing he got out of education . Tammy sat in her foldout metal chair and watched the crowd . When this full-time flea market wheeler-dealer came up to her and said , " I got a proposition  --  you tell people that their lives will turn around if and only if they go buy a yardstick , slide rule , or micrometer from me , then I 'll give you 10 percent of the profit , " Tammy shook her head . <p> " I do n't believe in measurements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with that . To be honest , I 've gotten caught up in this game before , and it just did n't work out . " <p> Lamar looked over to the man and said , " We use a base-ten method . But there are cultures that go by base three , or base sixty . Look it up . It 's in the history of mathematics . " <p> The man selling measuring devices walked away as Lamar tried to arrange his balls on the table to give an example . He was engrossed in showing how some cultures have a counting system that goes , " One , two , two and one , two twos , many , " when plain little Eddie and her Aunt Jojo walked up to Madame Tammy 's table . <p> Tammy recognized the woman immediately , and pulled the gossamer veil over her face  --  not so much to hide herself from the kid as from Aunt Jojo . Aunt Jojo said , " Special Eddie ? This woman here can conjure up your momma . She can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seance movies . " <p> Lamar looked up . Aunt Jojo 's normal voice came out as if she spoke to someone a hundred yards away . Even Fagen and Weigel knew something different and decidedly odd was going on . <p> Tammy said , " I 'm doing fine , Eddie . " <p> The little girl peered in . Eddie was n't more than ten years old . She wore overalls and had pigtails . Her blank , fiat face pretty much worked as an advertisement for what her future held : a ninth-grade education at most , two children by age eighteen , a single-wide mobile home , and a husband who 'd beat her whenever possible . Little Eddie said , " I done good on my spelling test , Momma . " She spoke to Madame Tammy in the way a child speaks to big walking stuffed animals at Disney World , or Chuck E. Cheese 's . <p> Lamar said , " Spelling 's important , but math 's best . " No one looked his way . <p> Madame Tammy said , " Run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell you . Move to another state . Stick out your thumb and hitchhike to Iowa , or Wisconsin , as soon as possible . Do n't eat any more Spam , white bread , Vienna sausages , bologna , or bacon . Kick in the television set . Never watch afternoon talk shows . And do n't let anyone ever , ever take you to the flea market again . " <p> The girl pointed at Madame Tammy and said , " That 's my mommy . " She turned to Aunt Jojo . Eddie said , " One , two , three , four , five , six " evenly . <p> Aunt Jojo lurched across Madame Tammy 's table , knocked over the crystal ball , scattered the tarot cards , and grabbed for Tammy 's neck . Tammy tried to hold the woman back , to use what yoga and tae-kwon-do knowledge she had to repel the attacker . Aunt Jojo spit , clawed , and yelled , " Do n't you talk to your own baby that way . We 're doing the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> Lamar picked up one golf ball and threw it hard . He hit the woman in the left temple and stunned her momentarily . Fagen and Weigel rounded their respective tables and pulled Aunt Jojo to the ground . A crowd assembled . <p> Fagen said , " That might run her out of business for good . When a seer ca n't see trouble right in front of her , she ai n't doing her job . " <p> Madame Tammy unraveled her veil . She reached out for Eddie , led her to the van , and drove away . <p> " I saw everything that happened . I got my table over there , and I saw it all . My name 's Jeannie . If you need a witness , I 'm the one . " Jeannie stuck out her hand to Lamar . She pointed again toward her spread of milk glass . " I 've been waiting for something like this to happen here . I 'm surprised it has n't happened sooner . " <p> Fagen said , " Goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard you moved to California or something . I heard you gone back to teaching college . " <p> Aunt Jojo shook her head twice , looked around confused  --  kind of like a fainting goat  --  and instead of yelling out , " Where 's my baby , where 's my baby ? " like in any ordinary documentary , only brushed off her pantsuit and walked away . Was she embarrassed ? Did she hope that no one saw anything ? Did she think to herself , well , that 's taken care of ? When she got about five tables down the row , she turned and said , " I was wondering when God was going to let me know what should happen . " <p> Lamar smiled and waved at her . He turned to Jeannie and said , " I used to teach . You used to teach ? Man , what happened ? I was teaching math only a week ago . " <p> Jeannie said , " That woman attacked that woman . " <p> " No . Not that . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets ? " <p> Fagen walked back to his table . Aunt Jojo disappeared . Jeannie smiled and shook her head . Weigel said , " Snappa , snappa , snappa , snappa . " <p> Lamar said , " Somebody 's got to give me a ride back . My sister 's left me . " <p> Jeannie said , " I do n't know what happened . " Then she said she could take Lamar wherever he wanted to go right after eleven o'clock . She said she 'd never sold a piece of milk glass after eleven , that she 'd not taken any kind of poll about it , but that 's the way things worked out . " Plus , that guy selling all the rulers and whatnot is going to start bothering me pretty soon , if I remember his ways correctly . " <p> Lamar had no more bags , what with his sister gone . He did n't have his full allotment of golf balls . He stood there observing everyone , content with waiting . Lamar watched Jeannie across the gravel walkway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still do n't believe in chance , but things are n't looking so bad . <p> He thought , Cos a = cos b cos c + sin b sin c cos A for no reason in particular . Weigel and Fagen watched him nonstop , and he felt their stares . Lamar nodded at them occasionally , even told men who came by his table that if they were looking for a deal , they should go buy a pelt , or Davy Crockett hat , or an alligator head . <p> Now in the real world Lamar and his new colleagues would 've worried about Madame Tammy ; they would have packed up , driven up the mountain , and found a way for Tammy either to turn herself in or take plain little Special Eddie back to her aunt 's house . No one would 've put the incident somewhere in the back of his head , only to bring it up later inside a bar where Fagen conned some frat boy into betting who 'd pee first . In the real world this incident of mistaken mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in the Rolodex of flea market stories on par with how Frank McNutt and his kid Jacob used to sell empty Sears Silvertone radio cabinets when Jacob crawled into them with his tiny transistor job , etcetera . <p> From what everyone understood later , Madame Tammy got the girl to the Tower and simply held her for a good twenty-four hours before calling the Department of Social Services and explaining things . On different occasions Tammy would say that she told the little girl that there was no God whatsoever , or that God indeed took care of everyone . It 's pretty much documented that she made plain Eddie repeat , " The bleak shall inherit some mirth , " over and over until she got it right . <p> In the real world someone would 've stayed with Madame Tammy for more than a week , just to make sure she overcame the depression that set in , the hours of walking back and forth in her small house , silent . <p> Jeannie wrapped her milk glass in old newspaper and packed her trunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to go . They left . Ten minutes later a tiny man walked up to Fagen and said , " I heard some fellow this way sold golf balls cheap . He leave already ? " <p> Fagen pointed at the empty table . " Boy had to go check on his sister . He was selling twelve for a dollar when he was here . " <p> " Damn . I get four bucks a dozen . Course mine are clean . I scrub mine down with Clorox and all . I use me a toothbrush . I ai n't one of them men sticks the cuts and scuffs downward in the egg carton . " <p> Fagen nodded . " Good for you . You seem like a real moral man . You should 've been here earlier . There were a bunch of teachers who seemed to have problems . Maybe you could 've helped them out . You could 've been named Mayor of Flea Market . " <p> The man looked at Lamar 's empty table again . He said , " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen off ten-storey buildings , been drug by wild horses . " <p> Fagen smiled . He asked the man if he drank beer much , if he 'd like to see a stunt Fagen could do with his bladder . The man said he could n't . He said he had to retire , and came back south in order to track down his son and daughter . And though Fagen knew deep down that this man was Shorty , he did n't ask , or offer information . Fagen knew that this man , like everyone else in the flea market business , might be faking it , that he might work for some branch of the government , might be trying to chum up in order to make a bust . <p> Fagen looked at Weigel . They packed their wares simultaneously and drove away while Madame Tammy 's father pulled out a ripped and faded photograph of two children . <p> <p> By GEORGE SINGLETON <p>
