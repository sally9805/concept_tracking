Volunteer surgeons help Headnote battered women look in the mirror and find someone they can love // DRESSED IN A DARK BLUE SWEAT suit , Tracy Kinney paced the waiting room of the Meridian Plastic Surgery Center in Indianapolis . From time to time , she raised her hand distractedly to a bump just below the bridge of her nose . When a nurse asked Kinney to change into a surgical gown , she clutched her sister Sandy Barrick 's hand for support . " I 'm scared , " she said . " But I know if my face stays like this , all my life , whenever I look at it , I 'll think about what happened . " What happened to Tracy Kinney-a violent beating by her husband-is shockingly common in American homes . According to the Department of Justice , nearly 1 million U.S. women are assaulted every year by husbands or boyfriends . Many of the abused , like Kinney , require serious medical attention . Often , however , these women-afraid , ashamed or too poor to afford treatment  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . In April 1995 , Kinney became an early beneficiary of the National Domestic Violence Project , a program that so far has provided reconstructive surgery for some 500 battered women free of charge . The Project was conceived by Dr. Lori Hansen , whose work as a plastic surgeon in Oklahoma City exposed her to a number of women with damaged faces that mirrored shattered lives . " Most of them have low self-esteem and low self-worth-as well as scars , broken bones and broken teeth , " says Hansen , 42 . The power of reconstructive surgery was brought home to her in 1990 when she treated a woman from a shelter who had been burned all over her face with cigarettes . Given a new start physically , the woman ended her abusive relationship and later enrolled in school . Photograph " I 'm angry I wasted all those years , " // Hansen suggested the idea of a national group of volunteer plastic surgeons to Dr. George Brennan , then president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery , which , in cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , now sponsors the Project . Tracy Kinney , 33 , knows firsthand that the Project can help break long and complex cycles of violence . For her , physical abuse began during childhood in Noblesville , Ind . The fourth of five daughters born to Eugene Kinney , a machinist , and his wife , Margaret , a homemaker , Tracy grew up in a strict Pentecostal family When she was 11 , her father was forced to retire because of brain damage caused when he choked on a piece of meat at a barbecue , temporarily cutting off his oxygen supply . A changed man , he was depressed and frustrated and frequently vented his anger on Tracy . Periodically he would beat her and , when she was a teenager , throw her out of the house . " He was the only male figure I had around , " says Kinney . " That 's what I thought was normal . " Like many victims of abuse , Kinney suffered from low self-regard . Somehow , she thought , she must have done something to merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinney hid the truth , telling people she had fallen while roller-skating . " I felt like I deserved it , " she says . " I did n't want anybody to know he did it , because of how it would reflect on him . " Photograph A Volunteer Dr. Stephen Perkins reset Kinney 's broken nose and hid a scar above her eye . // Over time , Kinney established a pattern of relationships with violent men . In 1984 , three years after dropping out of Indiana Bible College , where she earned her high school equivalency diploma , she married a truck driver she had met in a bar . At first he limited his violent outbursts to punching holes in the wall . Soon he was hitting Kinney , too . Despite the abusive relationship , Kinney gave birth to a son , Blake , in 1987 , and , 19 months later , to a second son , Brent . Though the beatings continued , Kinney could n't bring herself to leave . " Mostly , I was thinking of the kids , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt my husband like that . Besides , it would have meant sticking up for me . That 's something I never did . " Finally , in the spring of 1989 , Kinney filed for divorce . Seriously depressed , she moved in with her parents . ( Although she took her two sons with her , Blake later returned to live with his father . ) Then , in 1994 , Kinney remarried , this time a maintenance foreman for a local school district . Again , Kinney had found a man with a terrible temper . " He could charm the birds out of the trees , then two minutes later kill them all , " says Kinney 's mother , who had tried to warn her daughter . The beatings , which began early in their relationship , continued on their Florida honeymoon . " He threw me off the bed and slugged me as hard as he could , " Kinney says , adding that her new husband even threatened to throw her off a 14th-floor balcony By the time they returned home , Kinney literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her own apartment . But one night around Christmas 1994 , Kinney drove to her husband 's apartment hoping to talkeven to reconcile . " When he saw it was me , he tried to shut the door , " she recalls . " When I would n't leave he grabbed me by the back of the head , pulled me inside and literally pounded my face into the floor . " Kinney managed to escape and drove back to her apartment , where she swallowed a handful of sedatives and fell asleep . " The next day I looked like death , " she says . " Both of my eyes were black . My nose was swollen , and I had a great big rug burn on the side of my face . " Photograph A " I hope he 's young enough to forget the violence , " says Kinney of son Brent . // Despite the severity of her injuries , Kinney did n't seek medical attention at the time-in part , she says , because she could n't afford it . A bigger factor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still loved her husband and did not want to jeopardize him . But without reconstruction her face remained disfigured . Kinney was at rock-bottom . A month earlier , she had been fired from her job as a trainer of mentally and physically challenged adults after a dispute with her employer . Only now did she finally decide to seek help . In March 1995 at the recommendation of a friend , she went to see Dr. Stephen Perkins , 44 , a Domestic Violence Project volunteer working at the Meridian Plastic Surgery Center . She explained that her broken nose was giving her debilitating headaches and making it difficult for her to breathe . When Perkins learned that Kinney 's injuries had been caused by her husband and that she had little money for surgery , he told her about the Domestic Violence Project-and volunteered his services . " Plastic surgeons know there are people out there who need our services and ca n't ask for them because of the cost , " says Perkins . " This is a way we can say , You need our help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incredulous . " It lifted me up in a lot of different ways , " she says of the two-hour surgery , during which Perkins reset her broken nose bones , reconstructed her nasal passages and reoriented the scar on her right temple . No longer was she reminded of the abuse every time she looked in the mirror . " Because I felt better about how I looked , I felt better about myself . For the first time , it gave me something to look forward to . " Days after the operation , Kinney filed for divorce ; in July , she started work as an aide helping physically challenged children on school buses . Eventually , she says , she would like to have a career helping battered women break free from domestic abuse . Photograph " I 've learned abusive relationships are n't normal , " // " It 's a tough corner to turn , but once you do , life is so much easier , " says Kinney . " You see everything differently I know now that I do n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can make a choice . I do n't have to live the way I did in the past . " <p>
