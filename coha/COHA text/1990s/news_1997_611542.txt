<p> Can U.S.-Chinese relations rise from the ashes of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ? <p> Deng died last Wednesday , and his remains were cremated today at almost exactly the same moment Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived here to see if China and the United States can bury some of their differences of the last four years . <p> Deng , whose body was borne to the crematory through streets thronged with thousands of people , was a supporter of good relations with the United States , recognizing it as a source of investment , technology and education . He established formal diplomatic ties in 1979 , initiated educational exchanges , visited the White House and made a tour of the United States that included a rodeo in Texas . <p> But when Deng ordered Chinese troops to open fire on student-led demonstrators in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 , 1989 , part of the collateral damage was China 's relationship with the United States . The picture of a lone demonstrator standing in front of a tank on a street in Beijing may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Military cooperation agreements were canceled , technology sales prohibited and , for a short while , investment slowed . <p> This year , the United States and China are trying to make a new start . The 1997 calendar is crowded with trans-Pacific visits : After Albright 's , Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to the United States in March ; Vice President Gore to China in late March ; various senior military officials shuttling back and forth ; and eventually reciprocal meetings between Presidents Jiang Zemin and Clinton . Jiang , unlike Deng , was not implicated in the bloody 1989 crackdown . <p> In addition , China is trying to woo Congress . So far this year , more than 10 percent of the congress membership has visited China . Most leave expressing greater sympathy for the Communist government . <p> U.S. officials are trying to make a breakthrough on talks to admit China to the World Trade Organization . The two nations seem determined to make it a year of banquets and toasts instead of practice missile firings and verbal salvos . <p> But a handful of issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potentially messy return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty this summer  --  could still reduce the best laid plans to ashes . <p> Moreover , while Chinese leaders have promised a warm reception for Albright , it remains to be seen whether the new secretary of state , who prides herself on frank talk about human rights , will get along with Chinese leaders , who say that their human rights record is nobody else 's business . When Albright 's predecessor , Warren Christopher , visited in early 1994 , China detained leading dissident Wei Jingsheng and berated Christopher for harping on human rights . Christopher did n't visit again until just before he left office . <p> Even if Albright 's discussions here go well , troubles could be close behind . Next month , the United States is planning to support a perennial resolution at the U.N . Human Rights Commission in Geneva to condemn China 's human rights record . In past years , Chinese lobbying has blocked its passage , but diplomats said recently that the Americans have been visiting foreign capitals to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tried to identify four ways the Chinese could show improvement if they want Washington to drop its support for the Geneva resolution : release prominent political prisoners ; allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit prisons ; accede to U.N . covenants on human rights ; and find a structure for dialogue with the United States , even if that involves nongovernmental organizations on the U.S. side . <p> " The issue of human rights reflects the American character , it reflects who we are as a people , " said a diplomat , when asked if the United States were laying aside human rights concerns . To that , Albright brings her own experience and that of her family as victims of both Nazi and communist human rights abuses in Europe . <p> The ability of the Chinese government to accommodate U.S. concerns on this issue is diminished by the political situation here ; Albright is stepping into the closest approximation China has of an election year . <p> On the eve of a state memorial service for Deng , Jiang , who is president and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the cover of his patron . Premier Li Peng , now finishing his second term , must leave that post and jockey for another job  --  maybe one of Jiang 's  --  at the autumn party congress . The chairman of the national legislature , Qiao Shi , is also angling for a new post , and perhaps a half-dozen people are quietly campaigning for the jobs Li and Qiao vacate . <p> In that context , advocating concessions on human rights would hardly bolster one 's image in a country in which nationalism is running strong and the government insists it will not be lectured on human rights . When the State Department released its recent human rights report criticizing China , China 's response was typical : Do n't interfere in our internal affairs , and get your own house in order . <p> Jiang will be further constrained by Li , who heads the Communist Party 's " leading group " on foreign affairs . Many analysts believe Li , reviled by many for signing the 1989 martial law order , is still angry about taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about human rights criticism from abroad . <p> The foreign affairs leading group , comprising about 20 people , usually meets every two to three months to set general policy directions and review decisions . <p> China 's leaders indicate they feel they have the upper hand in the rights conflict . Over the last two years , they have rounded up virtually every significant dissident , cracked down on unofficial church groups and aggressively undermined the Dalai Lama in Tibet . And yet foreign investment continues to pour into China at a rate of more than $ 115 million a day . <p> Another diplomatic hurdle this year could be Taiwan . The United States is supposed to begin delivery early this year of 150 advanced F-15 fighters to Taiwan under a $ 1.15 billion Lockheed contract . China said , and many American analysts agree , that the sale violates a treaty between the United States and China limiting advanced weapons sales to Taiwan . President George Bush approved the sale in the heat of the 1992 election campaign . <p> The transition in Hong Kong also could affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory and more than $ 10 billion in American money has been invested there . The Clinton administration is looking to China to fulfill its promise to maintain Hong Kong 's relatively free way of life . <p> The U.S. trade deficit with China is also a sore point . According to U.S. government estimates , China 's exports to the United States last year , outstripped American imports here by about $ 38.9 billion . Clinton administration trade negotiators will press for China to open its markets to more American products . <p> Despite the stumbling blocks , U.S. officials seem determined to try to resolve disputes and to put the best face on those they ca n't . Albright " will not hold the relationship hostage to a single issue , " said a diplomat in Beijing  --  an echo of Clinton 's State of the Union address , in which he declared : " An isolated China is not good for America . A China playing its proper role in the world is . " <p> The hardest issue to finesse could be human rights . The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Communist party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation , exile , the imposition of prison terms , administrative detention , or house arrest . " <p> Depending on the route Albright takes to her meetings with Chinese officials later today , she might drive by the heavily guarded Tiananmen Square , fenced off lest disgruntled Chinese use Deng 's funeral to express their feelings about the government .
