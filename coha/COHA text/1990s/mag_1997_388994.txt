AN EXPLOSION IN LAS VEGAS PLAYS AS PERFORMANCE ART // The Loizeaux family 's impact on the American landscape can be measured best by what is no longer here : the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Denver . the King Cotton Hotel in Memphis , the Northwest Bank in Minneapolis . an entire city block in Dallas , the Pruitt-Igoe housing projects in St. Louis , the Wayne Minor Houses in Kansas City , Missouri , the remains of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , and the Hacienda Hotel , which vanished from the Las Vegas skyline on New Year 's Eve before an audience of half a million delirious tourists and millions of television viewers across the country . The Loizeaux family has used its expertise to destroy weapons systems and missile sites throughout the former Eastern bloc states as well as burning oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and twenty-six earthquake-damaged buildings in Mexico City . In 1972 , the Loizeaux took down a thirty-two-story skyscraper , the largest building ever demolished with explosives , in Sao Paulo , Brazil . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of one structure every two days for the forty-five years that the family company , Controlled Demolition Incorporated , or CDI , has been in business . Demolition is a particularly American act , a concise and visually compelling expression of the belief that history is transient , that a new beginning is always in the cards , that the glories of the past are only a prelude to an even more Ilorious , everlasting present . Although no one knows exactly how many buildings are demolished in America in any given year , estimates are that $2 billion to $3 billion worth of demolition contracts are bid on annually by six to seven hundred firms . The overwhelming majority of these jobs-concrete stanchions , parking lots , five-story garages , tract houses , row houses , apartment houses , highway overpasses , and wornout shopping malls-are accomplished over a period of weeks or months through nonexplosive means : bulldozers , construction cranes , wrecking balls , and jackhammers .

Of the four companies , Controlled Demolition Incorporated is the most experienced and , not surprisingly , the best insured . Before striking out on their own , both Redyke and Pettigrew were employed by the Loizeaux . Spanning three generations , five decades , and tens of thousands of hand-placed explosive charges , the Loizeaux family story can be read both as the heartwarming tale of an ordinary family that does extraordinary things and as a history in reverse of the United States , written in dynamite and detonating cord . The company was founded by " Daddy Jack " Loizeaux , the seventh and youngest son of Alfred S. Loizeaux , chief engineer for the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company , whose name appears on the blueprints for the Southern Seafood building in Baltimore , which Jack 's sons , Mark and Doug , and Mark 's daughters , Stacey and Adrienne , obliterated two years ago to make way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree stumps Jack Loizeaux dislodged with dynamite during the 1930s , the family moved on to brick chimneys and coal tipples , to the low bridges cleared to make way for Dwight D. Eisenhower 's Interstate Highway System , to the worn-out steelyards and factories of Pennsylvania , to the slum blocks cleared for urban renewal under Presidents Johnson and Nixon , and , more recently , to the housing projects built in their place . Of all the many stops on the Loizeaux family 's well-traveled road of destruction , it is hard to imagine a more resonant example of the particular process and the larger implications involved in demolition work than the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . The Sands opened on December 15 , 1952 , and closed its doors in July of last year after a weekend stand by the comedian Gallagher , who enjoyed a moment of fame in the Eighties for an act in which he smashed watermelons with a sledgehammer . In between , the casino welcomed Frank Sinatra , Joey Bishop , Sammy Davis Jr. , Rotarians , and members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nameless men from New York , Newark , Los Angeles , Miami , Chicago , and Minneapolis who checked in with empty suitcases and checked out the next morning with thousands of dollars in cash skimmed off the top for their absentee bosses , who sold out in 1967 to Howard Hughes , under pressure from the FBI and the Justice Department . The Sands witnessed the rise and fall of strong-arm men and billionaires , of LBJ and J. Edgar Hoover . It saw JFK in his underwear and the astronauts of Apollo 13 sunning themselves by the pool . More than a landmark of postwar America , the Sands was five decades of unwritten history expressed in solid , structural form . When , early last November , I met with Doug Loizeaux at CDI 's Maryland headquarters , our conversation turned again and again to the family 's plans to demolish the Sands on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving ; until Doug made me an offer I could n't refuse . " The Sands should be fun , " he said . " Why do n't you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the job ? " The Sands tower stands in the forward part of the casino lot , looming over Las Vegas Boulevard like a giant tube of lipstick , poker-chip balconies dotting its circumference and a narrow exterior staircase running like a seam up its right-hand side . In front of the tower stands the wom-out neon sun that lit up the Strip at night above the legend A PLACE IN THE SUN . The casino fixtures , from slot machines to gaming tables to the furnishings of the high-roller suites , were disposed of at a public auction held by the Robin brothers of San Francisco last August , and by mid-November the work of demolition is already far advanced . Wrecking cranes roam like prehistoric animals taking saw-toothed bites from the low-lying roof of the casino buildings adjacent to the eighteenstory tower . The original two-story stucco buildings of the hotel-the Santa Anita , Hialeah , Triple Crown , Belmont , and Arlington-are reduced to bare concrete palates where massive air-conditioning units and neat piles of switchboxes await the wreckers ' trucks tomorrow . In the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupts like a late-Sixties public sculpture from the greenish waters of the Paradise Pool . Photograph SANDS BOSS JAKIE FREEDMAN WITH A SHOWGIRL , CIRCA 1955 // The Loizeaux brothers , Mark and Doug , will not arrive on-site until two days before the implosion . Until then , the preparatory work proceeds in stages . Floor by floor , the local contractor , LVI , clears each of the six " shotfloors " where the explosives will be placed-the ground , mezzanine , second , fifth , ninth , and twelfth floors of the Sands tower-with a jackhammer mounted on a Bobcat , a small , highly maneuverable , low-slung vehicle with a wire cab and a snub-nosed front that suggests an oversize children 's toy . The destruction of the shot-floors is loud and dramatic : carpets are ripped up , mirrors shattered , walls punched out , until the hallways and hotel rooms where the tourists once unpacked their bags , dressed for dinner , and mourned their losses at the tables downstairs are reduced to a rubble of concrete and plaster . The litter is plowed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floors are swept clean until only the structural elements remain : the bare concrete floor , the desert sun shining in through the empty windows . Concentric rows of cylindrical , threefoot-thick concrete columns ring the core of the elevator shaft like an arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of an atom . Every building begins as a dream . Destroying a building , on the other hand , is a matter for realists rather than dreamers , a slow , almost biblical reckoning as the layers of wood veneer , smoked glass , and wallpaper-glued , screwed , tacked , and stapled onto the concrete wallsare stripped away. - On the uncleared floors of the tower , the halls are lined with rows of cast-iron bathtubs , and the air is heavy with the sweetly tainted smell of rotting carpet and wet plaster . In the rooms themselves , the hopeful progression of the casino 's decor is reversed as layers of wallpaper are scraped away : grandmotherly plaids give way to gaudy peacock reds and blues , and , finally , the original Casbah arches against a flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , home to generations of junketeering tourists , is CDI 's on-site project manager , Jim Santoro , a cheerful forty-year-old . Before coming to work for CDI he ran a mental hospital in upstate New York , an activity that seems to have prepared him well for dealing with the many different types of people one meets on construction sites worldwide . Jim 's cheerfulness can also be explained by the flesh-colored hearing aid he wears over one ear , which allows him to survey the work undisturbed by the pounding drills . When he is finished inside he retires to the parking lot , where he sits in the front seat of his rental car and makes dozens of calls on his fliptop phone before breaking for lunch . He spends his afternoons driving around Las Vegas , submitting forms and plans to fourteen separate departments in seven regulatory agencies in order to obtain the five specific permits required before the Sands can come down.l As each floor of the hotel tower is cleared , CDI 's drilling crew moves into position . The crew is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dusty blue coveralls . Working two to a drill , the workers bore holes 1.75 inches in diameter into the 131 shot- T columns where the charges will be placed , as Thom Doud , Doug 's handsome , black-haired nephew , shouts instructions , urging the workers forward like a high school quarterback in the closing minutes of a tight game . The paralyzingly loud drills they use , with their smooth-wom stocks and long , tapered noses , are picture-book examples of twentieth-century industrial design . The combination of the noise , the safety goggles pulled down over eyes , the earplugs stuck fast in ears , and the stark , monochromatic shade of the drilling floors creates an otherworldly landscape from which recognizable sensory cues have been erased . The work takes a tremendous physical toll , and by the end of the day the workers are tired and sore , their torsos covered with bruises and welts . One of the first lessons of demolition work is that the blueprints and specifications drawn up by architects and engineers can never be trusted . In the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the usual causes of larceny , greed , and deceit but from the overscrupulous nature of the original contractor , who , no doubt frightened of the extralegal consequences that might result from the collapse of the Mob 's favorite playground , packed the tower 's concrete columns with tremendous con- centrations of rebar , or reinforcing steel . The drilling proceeds much slower than expected as carbide drill bits that would normally retain their edge for weeks are worn within days to the smoothness of bone . The exterior staircase , fixed to the side of the tower with the same overzealous concentrations of rebar , presents a similar obstacle to a smooth demolition , and calls are made back to headquarters in Maryland to consult with CDI 's engineers and to warn Mark and Doug that the Sands may not go down as easily as planned . Once the drilling is done , the six-man covering crew-led by Mark 's nineteen-year-old daughter , Adrienne-takes over , lugging precut rolls , six feet tall by eight feet wide , of chain-link fencing and thick black covering fabric up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-site is something of a challenge , as the workmen gossip and speculate behind her back and mistranslate her instructions into Spanish . " How do you say , " Bring the fabric up to the third floor ' ' ? " she asks a worker named Carlos , who smiles broadly , flexes his chest , and offers a different phrase instead . " Come up to my bedroom and screw me all night , " . Adrienne orders . After eight long hours of hauling the heavy rolls up three or four flights of stairs , however , the workers ' discomfort with her has been transformed into a companionable respect . The task of preparing the columns for the blast is simple and repetitive : Each column is wrapped with a layer of the chain-link fencing and then with covering fabric , which is tied in place with steel wire . These materials will contain flying debris when the charges are set off . As the work progresses , each finished floor takes on the mysterious aspect of a modern Stonehenge , intended to measure the cycles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road or preparing for a job , the Loizeaux family lives and works together on a forty-fiveacre compound in the pre-suburban horse country of Phoenix , Maryland , forested by well-spaced trees and graced by a picture-perfect babbling brook that lends the spread the overly peaceful feel of a Zen monastery. , A 1940s brick manor house in the center of the property functions as CDI 's corporate headquarters and is home on workdays to some seventeen employees , including secretaries , bookkeepers , an engineer , a drilling expert , two project managers , Mark and Doug Loizeaux , and Mark 's daughter Stacey . The brothers and their families live on the property in rambling houses a hundred yards apart , which they have furnished over the years with stained glass , oak paneling , and other architectural features salvaged from the buildings they have demolished . The first time I entered the manor house , I was greeted by a kitchen sink full of unwashed coffee mugs and then by an array of clocks above the desks of the secretaries displaying the current time in Minsk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assignment board listed ongoing projects in red and blue Magic Marker : the Sands tower in Las Vegas ; a seventeen-story office building in Norfolk ; Virginia ; the Lexington Terrace projects in Baltimore ; the Clifton smokestack in Arizona ; an oil rig in the North Sea ; three cooling towers at a power station in Madras , In dia ; SS-25 missile pads in Belarus . The preparation for each implosion-from getting the necessary permits to knocking out interior walls and drilling the holes where the explosives will be placed-can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months . The charge for a medium-size. implosion , such as the Sands , ranges from $100,000 to $200,000 . This is a surprisingly modest sum , but volume is high : at any one time , CDI is likely to have two or more teams preparing implosions across the country or around the world ; the company 's gross revenues last year amounted to roughly $12.5 million . The CDI promotional literature presents the Loizeaux brothers as a pair of well-built men in their mid-forties with short-cropped hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , meeting them for the first time , I was struck immediately by the fact that they look nothing alike . Doug , the younger brother , is taller and clean-shaven and moves with the lazy confidence of a high school athlete turned successful suburban businessman , a guy you would expect to find driving his sports car too fast or playing squash at the club when he ought to be at work . Mark , whose reddish hair is supplemented by a close-cut beard , is more introspective . In the Hollywood action-hero version of the Loizeaux family story , Mark might foil a terrorist plot to blow up the White House on the eve of an important summit meeting with the Japanese , or he might be the terrorist . If you ignored the souvenir bricks and the lengths of steel cable as thick as your arm on the bookcase shelves , Mark 's office could easily have passed for a Better Homes and Gardens illustration of how to give your workspace that gracious , lived-in feel while still retaining the formality necessary to the conduct of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , pitched ceiling , and outdoor terrace one might expect of a time-share rental at an upscale ski resort . The morning I arrived , Doug was watching footage from CDI 's recent Lexington Terrace implosion in Baltimore , in which five grimly functional red-brick housing blocks had been demolished to make way for low-rise , low-income housing . In the last year or so , CDI has imploded twenty-eight housing projects across the country , jobs that provided an unmistakably sincere statement of President Clinton 's desire to " end welfare as we know it . " As such , these events are regularly attended by government officials such as former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros , who showed slides of the implosions to promote the work of his department . But what interests Doug this morning are not the political uses to which his work is put , or even the technical aspects of the job , but the aesthetics of the event as seen through the lens : the long slow sweep of the camera as the five brick buildings melt away from the skyline to reveal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the buildings go down , one after another , a cloud of concrete dust billows toward the camera , leaching the color from the frame and flecking the lens with bits of paint and concrete . " That pan , " Doug said , " was wonderful . " When he was younger , Doug wanted to make movies , an ambition reflected in the hundreds of CDI archive photographs of a younger , bearded , hard-hatted Doug with shoulder-length hair and a Super-8 camera in his hand , and responsible in part for the company 's comprehensive library of still and motion-picture footage of nearly 7,000 structures in various stages of dynamic collapse . The most compelling of these appear in " The Art of Demolition , " a four-minute montage accompanied by a synthesizer soundtrack that sounds like a cross between the theme from Chariots of Fire and the bass-heavy thump of a porno flick . " Look at those beautiful Palladian windows , " Doug said , as the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Denver slid gracefully to the ground . Then we were treated to a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collapse , filmed through the canyons of steel and glass that make up the modem , up-to-date city of Charlotte , North Carolina . " Mmmm , " he said . If the slow disintegration of buildings under wave after wave of explosive charges has its own undeniably resonant aesthetic , whether seen as surrealist landscape or as real-time action sequence , an answer to the endless loop of collisions and explosions we consume like a drug , the CDI library serves a practical purpose as well . Films of past implosions allow the brothers to study the motion of falling buildings frame-by-frame and thereby learn from their experience : the Sands tower , for example , bears a structural resemblance to the core of the Landmark , the flying-saucer-like hotel and casino built by Howard Hughes that dominated the Vegas skyline like a prop left over from some ancient B movie until CDI cut the structure in two with explosives three years ago . The brothers ' obsession with their craft has also resulted in a growing symbiotic relationship with Hollywood-they frequently provide footage of collapses and custom-made explosions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windswept footage of the implosion of the Traymore Hotel appears at the beginning of Louis Malle 's Atlantic City ; Joel Silver , the actionmovie producer , employed CDI for special-effects work on Demolition Man and Lethal Weapon Ill ; Tim Burton used footage of the Landmark implosion in his Mars Attacks . Doug takes pleasure in the sense of directorial control that the work provides , a spectacular instant staged not merely for the camera but for the thousands who gather to mark the final moments of the buildings they have worked in , lived in , fought in , loved in , or simply walked past every day on their way to some other building . The emotion held in these moments is a mixture of sadness and hope and awe , a confirmation that the past is behind us , blown to pieces , while the future is waiting , wide open and new . " You hear people screaming , and it 's such a venting of frustrations for so many people , " Doug told me . " I used to think people came to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crash , but it 's not that . It 's controlling something that they see as uncontrollable . And looking at something so large and seeing it reduced to nothing in a matter of seconds gives them a feeling of power . It 's that scream-YESSSS ! " For television and print reporters , the implosion of a local landmark with high-powered explosives is a gift from God , and the Loizeaux are quietly proud of their ability to handle the press , to answer the standard-issue questionsfamily stories , biggest building ever imploded pounds of dynamite used per year-with con summate skill . The reassuring image the fami ly projects is an important part of the work the ' do . Blowing up tall buildings with high-powerec explosives in heavily populated areas is an un dertaking founded on trust : the family 's chie competition arises not so much from other im plosion experts but from more traditional , les instinctively terrifying methods of demolition And the fact that CDI is a family company with a grandfather , sons , and granddaughters al working together , tends t0 soften @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " family " serves a pragmatic as wel as a descriptive function i hardly lost on Doug an ( Mark . Both brothers choose their words carefully , be cause their work demands precision and because the careful use of language is a necessary tool to help soften perceptions of what , to laymen at least , is essentially a destructive and risky occupation . The word " implosion , " for example , was popularized by the family in the 1950s in an effort to put another comforting layer of distance between the work they do and the popular idea of an explosion as a violent , uncontrolled , destructive act , an unwelcome reminder of a generation 's wartime experiences in Europe and Korea . The family 's attention to language has its advantages : CDI , unlike its competitors , is able to purchase upward of $300 million in liability insurance-enough to cover even the most unlikely disasters , from bricks in the head to heart attacks to the leveling of entire city blocks . Apart from the obvious uses of the word " family " to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all families , the Loizeaux brothers see the family and its traditions from their own particular points of view . Doug keeps his family and the family business as far apart as possible : when asked what he does for a living at dinner parties , his usual answer is " contractor . " Mark Loizeaux , on the other hand , was born to blow things up . Doug remembers his older brother as a boy floating paper boats down the stream in front of their house , then blowing them out of the water with charges fashioned from firecrackers . At ten Mark helped his father take down their first buildings with explosives , an apartment complex in Washington 's Foggy Bottom neighborhood , where the State Department stands today . At twelve he designed and set off his first array of charges from start to finish , demolishing a 1 TO-foot-tall bridge pier . At eighteen , after his father was hit by a car and injured , Mark left college and took over the company . His enthusiastic and single-minded absorption in his work is obvious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings move once the charges go off with an engineer 's ability to bring down a thirty-story tower weighing thousands of tons in a space the relative size of a shoebox without breaking so much as a pane of glass in neighboring skyscrapers . He actively encourages his two older daughters ' involvement in the business , and takes his fourteen-year-old twins , Jason and Devon , on the road , with an eye toward edu cating them about the business oi demolition . " I think any craftsman is proud of what he makes or creates , " Mark said , looking back on the family 's three generations of demolition experience . " I can go into almost any major city in this country , or in the world , and drive by with one of my daughters or my son and say , Well , see that building there ? I took down the structure that replaced the structure that my father took down , that this has now replaced , and that you 'll be taking down someday . " ' Mark enjoys demolition work 's power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awe from thousands of spectators . He likes watching the pictures on TV . He likes making a plan in his head and seeing it expressed in the controlled collapse of thousands of tons of steel and concrete . Mark 's conversational manner is calm , logical , and direct , and so it took hours of conversation , over several days , to realize that the exterior Mark presents is very similar to that of a convinced Marxist or neurobiologist or horseplayer who believes that he has found the secret fix , the hidden lever that moves the world . He is a man whose entire being is energized by one big idea . Driving down the street with Jason , past the horse farms and the Christmas-tree ranch and the herd of bison owned by a wealthy local dentist , they approach a radio tower , and Mark listens with pride as his son describes the array of RC-900 charges he would use to bring it down . Walking past Rockefeller Center to visit CDI 's insurers , Mark passes the time by planning the precise sequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " It 's true , I admit it : it 's human nature , " he told me , his eyes lighting up with the reflected glory of the tens of thousands of explosions , real and imagined , inside his head . " The way a plastic surgeon looks at a woman with bags under her eyes , you know , and wonders . " My second night in Phoenix I met Mark Loizeaux and his family for dinner at a local restaurant , the kind of place you find in once-rural areas , with names like " The Huntsman 's Tavern " or " Hound and Horn , " red-coated gentry riding to the hounds across the walls and local divorcees gathering in a knot at the bar on Thursday nights . Mark 's wife , Sherry , has the blonde , blue-eyed look of a Virginia high school prom queen grown into a comfortable middle age without having lost the native good humor and core beliefs of the gentler tradition in which she was raised . When she asked me sincerely if I believed in true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say yes . After a medium-rare steak and a couple of glasses of scotch , Mark 's conversation strayed to what was obviously his own true love : explosives demolition . " I 'll tell you the thing I 've found really scary , " he , said . " More and more I look at structures and I think , If I were a terrorist , how would I take it down ? ' Oklahoma City really flipped some switches there , " he added , a slight twitch having developed at the corners of his mouth . " I find myself realizing just how simple , how easy . It 's like those silly things you walk through to get into airports . I walk right by that stuff . Do you realize that everything we have is just saturated with explosives ? PETN , that powder they found traces of on TWA-flight 800 because somebody hid explosives there when they were testing dogs months ago ? Well , our bags are just steeped in that stuff . And I 've never had a dog bark , wag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Having helped blow up buildings since he was eight , and having built up a profitable sideline in antiterrorist consulting over the past sixteen years , for private business and for the Army 's Special Forces , Mark has solid , professional reasons for seeing the world as he does . But every good cop , as they say , is also part criminal . " We could drop every bridge in the United States in a couple of days , " Mark was saying , just thinking out loud , and then his eyes lit up as the idea took on its own special resonance inside his head . " I could drive a truck on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge and have a dirt bike on the back , drop that bridge , and I would get away . They would never stop me . " " How often does a thought like that occur to you ? " I wondered aloud , as Mark took another sip from his scotch . " Every time I cross a bridge . " One clue to the force of Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning , as the brothers planned the demolition of an oil rig in the North Sea and laughed over the misfortunes of one of their competitors , who had just dropped the chimney of a high-rise apartment building across a commuter track , disrupting local rail service . As the brothers conferred , I had the chance to spend a few hours with their father , " Daddy Jack " Loizeaux . He looked remarkably spry for a man in his mid-eighties , showing up at the office in a gray track suit , having just won two hard-fought sets of tennis against a man twenty years his junior . He was happy to tell me about his life 's work , which began on a sunny afternoon at the University of Georgia forestry school when he was introduced , in classic Mephistophelian fashion , to a Mr. Johnson of the Du Pont Corporation , who arrived on campus one afternoon to survey the Oconee River and returned several weeks later with a truckload of dynamite . With a twist of the detonator , a shower of dirt exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of the Oconee were straightened in seconds , an event that left the elder Loizeaux with a vivid and lasting impression of what he still refers to today as " the awesome power of explosives . " Working as a forester in Baltimore , he soon turned to explosives as a method of removing stumps as Dutch elm blight killed off the stately trees by the thousands , until Mr. Johnson called again , directing his protege to the Aberdeen Proving Ground , where the army needed someone to take down five tall brick chimneys . Young Jack solved the problem with typical Popular Mechanics ingenuity : he notched the bases of the chimneys as if they were trees and used explosive charges to lay them gently on their sides . As Daddy Jack told his story , I found myself lulled into the same pleasant state of mind one experiences on a long drive when the only voice available over the radio is that of the announcer on the Christian station telling the miracle of the loaves and the fishes . The cause of this association is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loizeaux raised Mark and Doug according to the precepts of the Plymouth Brethren , a somber , Quakerish sect , and explosives demolition is for him a kind of parable in which the moral tenets of his faith find their concrete , earthly expression . Before every blast , he said , he would pray with his sons and " thank the good Lord for the gravity . " Daddy Jack 's ongoing ministry of destruction has taken him , he told me , to the Naval Academy at Annapolis , to local high schools , and , on one occasion in the 1980s , to the television studios of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker , whose literal-minded brand of evangelism was not in sympathy with his own more sober beliefs . " He seemed to have the impression that God had spoken to me from the heavens , telling me to take down buildings , " Daddy lack related , cupping his hand to his ear . " I told him it did n't happen that way at all . " He does , however , see the structural integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be undermined by bad character and sinful actions . " I think about how long it took to plan it , and to build it , and the expense , " he said , of the moments before a building comes down . " And then in a few seconds I can destroy it all . And when I speak to young people , I tell them how important it is when they build a character , a reputation , because whether it 's sex or drugs or their language , it 's like taking the columns out of a structure . It gets weaker . And all of a sudden-bang ! She 's gone . " Jack Loizeaux is shrewd about his sons ' vulnerabilities . Mark 's sin is the sin of pride and hard dealings . Doug 's sin is the same as his father 's : he is soft . " Mark could be in Hollywood , or he could be an attorney , one of the two , " he said . " He can put up a real tough front . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I can feel him shaking inside . But nobody knows it . He 'll walk around like he 's God . And Doug , I remember the first building he shot . He went into the alley and vomited . He can get real upset . " As the sun sank behind the Maryland hills , Daddy Jack remembered the Mitsubishi turboprop plane he used to fly from job to job , and the time the family was shot at with .22 rifles when they demolished the Pruitt-Igoe housing projects in St. Louis . He recalled standing on an airport tarmac in the days before faxes and Federal Express and handing the flight attendant a $20 bill to fly the plans of a building from Baltimore to Los Angeles so that another engineer could examine them . " If I had my way , " he said , " I 'd love to shoot buildings before daybreak when nobody is around-no cameras , no nothing . " The jobs he likes best , he said , are those on the water-just the crew and nature and God 's gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boom , " he said , recalling the first pier he ever shot , " and we eliminate that pier with no fly at-all . Now is n't that wonderful ? " As one looks out over the desert mountain and the freeways from the top floor of the Sands tower , with the fluorescent r wallpaper peeling from the walls , the threadbare green carpet littered with broken glass , the secular forces behind the impending demise of the Sands are easy to spot . The Mirage Hotel across the street , into whose outstretched black arms the Sands tower would fit with many rooms to spare , was built by developer Steve Wynn in the late 1980s , the beginning of the exuberant wave of casino building that has made Las Vegas one of the fastest-growing cities in the world , a **27;390;TOOLONG paradise firmly grounded in current American themes of " family " values , shopping , and addictive-compulsive behavior . After the vulgar neon highs of the Sixties and the shag-carpet lows of the Seventies , Las Vegas is finally a city at ease with itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early every morning as mothers push infants in strollers down marble walkways , pausing to wave hello through the glass partition at Siegfried &; Roy 's white tigers , then past the craps tables where Daddy is dropping next month 's mortgage payment , before they stop in for a breather at the DKNY boutique . From the top of the Sands I count twelve origami-like construction cranes dipping their pointed beaks down to the city below , toward the waiting bounty of waitressing jobs and construction sites , video-poker machines in every 7-Eleven , and giant billboards looming above the downtown casinos , promising " Free brunch if you cash your paycheck here . " Set to rise on the site where the Sands now stands is Sheldon Adelson 's $2 billion Venetian , the latest in the wave of themepark casinos that began with the MGM Grand and the Luxor and now includes New York-New York , with its one-third-scale replicas of the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty crisscrossed by a giant Coney Island rollercoaster . Soon to follow are the Bellagio , a high rollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a neon version of the City of Lights , complete with its own scale version of the Eiffel Tower . The historic passage from the faded glories of the Sands to Sheldon Adelson 's Venetian is a powerful testimony to the American belief in starting over ; in lucky numbers , charms , and stars ; in our expansive capacity for self-delusion ; as well as to the more general national transition from the smoke-filled backrooms where Las Vegas was born to the hazy methadone smog of movies and television . The pleasures of Las Vegas , old or new , however , hold little attraction for CDI . Life on the road for the crew is a matter of passing through a distant place at reasonable prices with the least possible resistance or distraction . The crew usually stays together in hotels close to the site with a bar downstairs and cable TV in the rooms . Sometimes the accommodations are worse , as they were in Seoul , where Jim and Thom shared an abandoned house and the South Korean contract workers slept six to a room next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best Western on Paradise Road are large and clean and even luxurious . Because the work is so exhausting , and the schedule so tight , the crew rarely ventures out of the Best Western . They meet in the downstairs restaurant for drinks and dinner and light conversation revolving mainly around the job , with sporadic excursions into the quality of the food , which is poor , and the hairstyles of the women seated at the bar . Entertainment at the Best Westem involves video-poker machines in the lobby and nightly performances by a bottle-blonde singer , perhaps twenty years old , with the demure red lips and hairsprayed curls of an up-andcoming Christian pop star . She has a bright and bouncy vocal style , as if someone had implanted a microchip from an early Eighties synthesizer keyboard inside her brain , and her repertoire is composed of airbrushed standards , drained of whatever shards of human emotion might have been accidentally embedded in their original versions : " The Tide Is High " by Blondie , " Suspicious Minds " by Elvis Presley , " Hey Jude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Kim Cames , " Heart of Gold " by Neil Young , several songs by Fleetwood Mac . Adrienne leaves early . The others continue to drink at the bar , where Jim , who is friendly to a fault , attracts more than his fair share of local wackos , who ask for a light and then go on for hours , laying it all out on the table-kids , divorce , retirement-until by nine or nine-thirty even Jim has had enough and retires to his room . After a week or so of going to bed late and waking up at five-thirty in the morning , I feel the same desperate , free-floating detachment I detected in the chain-smokers at the bar , an emotion that manifests itself , a week into my stay , in a chance encounter in the parking lot with one face of the new Las Vegas-a former diver named Greg , who parks his beat-up VW microbus in the space immediately below my room on a Saturday night and plays loud , thrashing music , which , after twenty minutes or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume . Greg is friendly , has long brown hair to his shoulders , and wears a black T-shirt advertising the Washington , D.C. , punk band Minor Threat . He grew up in Galveston , Texas , where he learned to dive off oil rigs in the Gulf before getting into a jam with his foreman as well as with some " very heavy big-time people . " The back of his van smells like an unwashed rug , and there is an army-green sleeping bag rolled up in the comer , along with the usual thrown-together mess of pots and pans and other equipment assembled by people who wake up one morning to take their show on the road and wind up somewhere like Las Vegas . Greg offers me a soggy joint and explains that he has come to Las Vegas in the hopes of finding a job in a casino and making a fresh start . What he likes best about Las Vegas , however , is the desert , with the wide-open spaces and the cactus and the wildflowers that bloom after a storm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people he knew in Galveston-the speed dealers , a girlfriend named Linda , Linda 's eight-year-old kid , Danny , a guy named Derrick , or Rick , and a number of other people who seem to have also existed in some shared nexus of amphetamines and oil rigs-I sense that his logic is skewed in a familiar , American way : he believes that what went wrong in Galveston was only bad luck and that by moving to Las Vegas , hundreds of miles from the nearest offshore oil rig , his luck will necessarily change for the better . The demolition site , when I arrive the next morning , is a hive of activity , with drills pounding and dust rising and massive dump trucks beeping , and grinding as they back out over the rubble-strewn lot , carting away their cargoes of history . Mark arrives on-site in the afternoon , hugs Adrienne , then retires to the front seat of his rented Buick Skylark , where he sits with his chin on the steering wheel for an hour or more in silence . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the shot-floors , gazing over at the support columns , feeling the concrete like a sculptor running his fingers over a block of uncut marble . All of these actions are part of a ritual by which Mark hopes to cement what he describes as his " empathetic relation " with the tower : in fortyeight hours , the Sands will be gone . The explosives arrive on-site just after 5:00 A.M. on Sunday . The driver , David Hoffman , meets us at the gate , a mildlooking man in his early thirties who sticks his head out the window of his 4 x 4 truck and shouts a friendly hello into the glare of the headlights . His stonewashed blue jeans feature the words SANDERS CONSTRUCTION on a red and yellow emblem , and there is an exploding stick of dynamite emblazoned on his pocket . Behind his truck is a trailer that looks like a reinforced UHaul . Inside the trailer are boxes containing detonating cord and blasting caps . The boxes resting on the open bed of the truck are filled with 880 pounds of dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulevard and break all the windows of the surrounding casinos . Unloading the explosives is an easy , unceremonious job . Because dynamite is more or less inert during transit , and detonators are volatile , the explosives must be stored separately . The inside of the trailer is lined with wood rather than metal , in order to prevent stray sparks from being struck while on the road . After a quick once-over , the crew unloads the dynamite from the back of Hoffman 's truck , uncouples the truck from the trailer , and locks the detonators and the dynamite safely inside . Then everyone repairs to the Denny 's , the next storefront over from the Sands , for an early-morning breakfast of bacon and eggs . After that , Hoffman drives off to spend the morning with his in-laws in Las Vegas , and the rest of the crew returns to the site , where we are joined by Doug and Stacey Loizeaux , who have flown out to lend a hand after imploding a seventeenstory office building in Norfolk , Virginia . The final stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning-the test shot-will determine exactly how much dynamite will be needed to blow the heavily reinforced columns of the Sands apart ; it is a step-bystep rehearsal for the larger and more complicated shot that is meant to reduce the tower to rubble on Tuesday morning . The dynamite itself looks much the same way it does in the Saturdaymorning cartoons : familiar-looking foot-long sticks wrapped in waxed paper , a cheery red color lending them an unmistakably festive appeal . Mark breaks a stick in half with his hands to reveal a creamy , black-flecked substance the consistency of marzipan but surprisingly smooth and dry to the touch.2 Loading the column for the shot is fun to watch , a combination of the family 's do-it-yourself inventiveness and the dangerous glamour of high-powered explosives . Mark pushes a silver detonator into the dynamite , then works the wired charge into the hole in the concrete with a sawed-off wooden mop handle until it hits the back of the column with a satisfying split . He follows the explosive with a brown paper sack filled with play sand , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole , then wires the charges together with lengths of bright yellow detonating cord containing the highly explosive crystalline powder PETN . Two groundfloor columns are loaded and wired-one with a stick and a half of dynamite , the other with a single stick . The yellow detonating cord is then attached with electric wire to the blasting machine , a black transformer box like the ones kids use to launch model rockets after school . The floor is cleared , Mark hands me the blasting machine , and on the count of five I flick the second and final silver switch , an act that is instantly rewarded by a rush of pure adrenaline to my brain and a boom that resonates in the center of my chest . " Check out the columns , " Mark says , and as we tear open the covering fabric , which has been only partially ripped open by the explosion , the imaginative pleasure I feel at the blast , stamped in cartoony Captain America colors , offering me the power to destroy my enemies with a pulverizing glance from my death-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid , three-foot-thick structural column reduced to a shattered mess of broken concrete and tangled steel . In the first column , where the lesser of the charges was placed , the concrete facing of the column has been blown away ; inside , however , the inch-thick supporting rods and the helixes of rebar remain unbroken . Working from the top of the tower down , Mark , Doug , and Stacey now slice open the covering fabric and pack the holes beneath  --  46 in all-with a stick and a half of dynamite each . The packed columns are then linked together with lengths of detonating cord and sequenced with delays-bright orange plastic tubes containing a dusting of the explosive powder RDXallowing the brothers to time the detonations , floor by floor , and thus control the shifting weight of the tower as it comes down . As each shotfloor is wired , the Loizeaux family moves down to the floor below , leaving behind a spider-like maze of.yellow cord hanging down between the black , funeral-shrouded columns . The worry now is that the steel reinforcing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will defy the force of the explosives and remain standing on the steel alone . Under Mark 's direction , the crew pounds the tower 's exterior walls with a jackhammer attached to the Bobcat , raising clouds of dust , knocking out concrete , and exposing rebar until the once-solid tower is transformed into a maze of blackwrapped columns , nests of wire , and ragged patches of clear litue sky . The crew then cuts through the rebar with acetyline torches , the thin blue flames licking through the steel with a surprising lack of resistance as showers of golden sparks cascade across the concrete floor . The work continues all day Sunday and on into Monday evening , with portable klieg lights illuminating the site like a movie set as the Sands tower is laced with explosives , transformed into a device for the controlled release of the massive amounts of kinetic energy that have been trapped inside its columns , floors , and walls for more than forty years . At eight in the evening , their hair gray from the dust , their faces exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are too exhausted to speak . Seated on the long black rolls of covering fabric , they listen to music , rhythm and blues competing with Spanish rap . Cigarette coals stand out in the dark and cast a glow on the faces so that the scene resembles some temporary border encampment of The air is heavy with concrete dust , and a pheromone mix of adrenaline and regret seems to emanate from the tower itself . Mark Loizeaux puts a hand on my shoulder . His hard hat is dirty ; there are purple bruises beneath his eyes . " Over the last few days we 've been changing the way it thinks about gravity , " he explains , ges turing up to the darkened tower . " We 've been changing the way it thinks about itself . It does n't have the sheer walls . It does n't have the redundancy of the structural supports . It stood there for years , ready to take on seismic events , winds , elevators going up and down , people walking back and forth and partying on New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting , the exterior columns of the shot-floors , wrapped in black , look like armbands worn to honor the dead . Inside , more than 287 pounds of dynamite are ready , wired , and waiting to explode . " What 's going to happen is , I 'm going to use its very strength against it , " Mark says , the familiar gleam returning to his eyes , his hands chopping away at the air in sequence with the planned detonation of the forty columns at the tower 's base . " What I 'm going to do is take the weight and hang it out there , and the tower is going to rotate right here , on the back of the elevator shaft , and pick the back columns right off the ground . They were n't meant to do that . And then it 's going to go . " Dipping down through the neon-lit haze of Las Vegas Boulevard late Monday night , the helicopters hover in.over the tower , shining shaky circles of light off the poker-chip balconies and down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metro police are out in force , more than a hundred policemen in cars and on foot , circling the site , stopping traffic , massaging batons , manning barricades , and barking instructions as a football field away from the tower 's base the latenight carnival crowd swells and surges forward , over 3,000 strong , insomniacs and thrill-seekers , curious tourists , gamblers and late-shift waitresses , rowdy young men in Los Angeles Kings jerseys , college students on break , and tourists like Jimmy Dickson of Los Angeles , who got married in the Silver Bells wedding chapel thirty or forty years ago and spent his honeymoon night at the Sands . In the crowd tonight are hangers-on who remember the hotel in its prime : Sinatra strutting across the stage , his eyes alight with their icy , psychotic glitter ; the Copa Girls kicking up their heels in white feather boas , wearing bowls of fruit on their heads , in metallic jumpsuits in honor of the astronauts , showing their stuff for the high rollers and the tourist couples , the husbands and wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hard to miss . They hold themselves like movie-star gangsters from the Thirties and Forties , like Jimmy Cagney and George Raft , ready for action , their arms up near their chests and chins thrust forward . The way they walk is particular , too , standing way up on the balls of their feet and striding through the crowd with an exaggerated hip-swinging side-to-side roll like sailors on shore leave spoiling for a fight . There is Danny Roscoe , who looks like a retired rancher ; John Getler , a bellhop , who learned never to take a suitcase from the hands of a guest ; and Sonny Benqert , who brought Sinatra his hamburgers medium-rare . In their memories the faces from the hotel 's history live on : The young JFK stands outside the Sands with Peter Lawford on a sunny afternoon in 1960 , a pair of gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses in hand , having just spent his first stolen hours with Judith Campbell and intimately involved his future presidency with the Mob . Lyndon Johnson looks sleek and handsome in a three-piece linen suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several men in dark suits . They remember the new corporate style of Howard Hughes , when the casino started whittling away at the size of a whiskey shot-first to a single ounce , then to seven-eighths of an ounce-and the hotel 's dreary final months , when the Sands lured walk-in slots players with $1 margaritas served in complimentary plastic mugs . What the crowd will see tonight is , as always , the end of a dream . The men who built the Sands-Frank Costello , Vincente " Jimmy Blue Eyes " Alo , Meyer Lansky , Longy Zwillman , Joseph " Doc " Stacher , and the rest-were an all-star team of organized crime whose grander , unspoken ambitions-money , fame , a place in the sun-are present still in the tremendous concentrations of steel reinforcing the tower 's structural columns . Freedman , the casino 's original frontman , was a Jewish gambler from Texas who wore bolo ties and cashmere coats and ran the high-stakes Domain Privee in Houston . His application for a Nevada gaming license was turned down by the commissioners of Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state agreed to forgo the standing request for net-worth statements on the grounds that the IRS might subpoena such documents for tax prosecutions against the licensees . Jack Entratter , who ran the Copa Room , had been sent out to the desert from his post as manager of the Copacabana in New York to book talent and to make sure that the suitcases full of cash arrived on time . As opening day approached , Sands publicist Al Freeman grew more and more frantic , finally outdoing himself with a planted item in Frank Farell 's New York Day by Day column in the World-Telegram &; Sun announcing that the casino had " rigged a minor atomic burst for the opening in place of the usual ribbon cutting . " Despite the rain and mist that blanketed Las Vegas on December 15 , 1952 , the opening night of the Sands , the beginning of the dream that will end here tonight in less than an hour , was all its sponsors could have hoped , with entertainment by Danny Thomas and a menu featuring asparagus and carrots from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chutney from India , peas and onions from Belgium , candied chestnuts from Italy , and hearts of palm from Brazil . " Who 's that at the gambling table next to you ? " wrote Broadway columnist Earl Wilson , who , like the other junketeering East Coast reporters , had his train fare , food , and wagers paid for by the house . " Maybe a Texas oil man . Maybe a character from the underworld . It could even be Ursula Thiess , the German actress who 's a friend of Robert Taylor and who does a nude swimming scene in the new picture , Monsoon . " ' Wisconsin sportswriter Roundy Coughlin was also impressed . " They got more people sitting at the gambling tables out here at four bells in the moming than work at the Gisholt and Oscar Mayer , " he cabled home , after counting thirty-one Cadillacs in the hotel parking lot and partaking of the $1.85 steak and potatoes dinner . Opening-night action at the tables was fierce , fed by escalating reports of losses by the casino so massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canny press release shouted banner heads of a $250,000 loss in the first eight hours , " Daily Variety later reported , " but by the close of third shift . . . the was off to the big-money races . " The greatest scam America had ever seen was on , the dream of a place where the sun was always shining , everything was permitted , and no one batted an.eye at the guards pushing garbage cans filled with silver dollars along Fremont Street toward the downtown banks . The further evolution of this timeless dream of transcendence is being unveiled tonight in a tinted-glass luxury suite at the Mirage Hotel before a mixed crowd of business-suited flacks and wearyeyed reporters . The Venetian , set to rise on the site where the Sands still stands , will be , according to one executive , " the largest hotel in the world . " The new hotel will feature replicas of the Bridge of Sighs and the Lido beach , as well as gondolas and canals , a clock tower , " thirty of the world 's finest restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suites , and a 750,000-squarefoot shopping mall , rendered in the accompanying drawings as a combination of Philip Johnson whorehouse modem and the mock-classical public buildings bestowed upon Rome by Mussolini . " We 're Las Vegas-izing the whole concept of Venice , " explains Sheldon Adelson , whose unnaturally smooth , tight skin suggests that at any moment he might reach up beneath his chin , tear off his human face , and begin barking orders at his subordinates . If the face of the Sands was the face of old-fashioned men of honor and respect , men with suitcases and guns , Adelson 's is the face of the new America , of bronzed , withered youth and corporate-style gaucherie . What Las Vegas is really about , however , is not gondolas or clock towers or luxury suites but time in its most precious , crystalline form : the time it takes to move walk-ins across the casino floor , or the time the average player will spend at the tables after gobbling down the $6.99 buffet . Time is what brings Sheldon Adelson and the Loizeaux together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take for the Sands to disappear from the face of the earth , Sheldon Adelson will gain eight or nine months that would otherwise be lost to the slow-motion work of wrecking balls and dump trucks , an intolerable pause in the sucker 's ballet . As the all-clear siren sounds above Las Vegas Boulevard , the cameras click and flash from the upper decks of the Harrah 's ing garage to the right of the Sands , recording the final moments of the eighteen-story tower about to vanish forever in a cloud of dust . Adrienne has rescued a family of pigeons from high in the tower , their eardrums torn and bloodied by the noise of the drilling ; she has swathed them in covering fabric and laid them to rest in the backseat of her father 's Buick . Now , with the shot only minutes away , she and her crew put a precautionary black tarp over the windows of the Denny 's next door . As the news helicopters circle overhead and shine their spotlights down on the lot below , Doug and Mark exchange a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the tower 's base , behind a massive air-conditioning unit , Adrienne is understandably nervous . In a few minutes she will press the button on the blasting machine , sending out an initial pulse of electricity lasting 25/l000th of a second . Too soon for the delay to be detected , the first flashes of light will be seen at the base of the tower , initiating a sequence of explosions that , if Mark 's calculations are correct , will rotate the structure off its axis at an angle of twenty-three degrees , just long enough to rip the exterior staircase free from the tower . The upper floors of the tower will then fold , as if connected to the floors below with a hinge , and the tower will duck neatly under the falling staircase and collapse in the open lot in front of us . " Resistance is 9.5 , " the walkie-talkie crackles as Mark checks the electric charge in the wires snaking out across the field to the tower 's base . " That checks , Doug . " The walkie-talkie crackles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding steady . " A silence has now fallen over the site , punctuated only by the occasional flashbulb , an expectant pause like the moment in an Olympic stadium before a long jumper leaves his feet and hurtles into the air . In this moment , you can feel the crowd 's awareness of the impending destruction of the tower in front of them expanding into a larger consciousness of their own mortality : what if the building sends showers of concrete and steel up into the air and down onto the thousands of spectators in the street below ? " Let 's have a good , safe job , " Mark says into his walkietalkie . " You know , " he reflects , his voice calm as he looks down at his daughter 's hand on the silver switch of the blasting machine , thinking back on the . thousands of explosive flashes and the thousands of skyscrapers , bridges , factories , hotels , prisons , apartment buildings , power stations , drilling platforms , missile sites , and many other structures that he has seen give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and crumple back to the ground , " this is the first one of these I 've done in a very long time where I have n't been 150 percent sure that the structure was actually going to come down . " Adrienne 's thumb trembles on the switch as the countdown begins- " ten . . . nine . . . eight . . . seven " - the numbers following one another too loud and too fast in the continuing silence . " I think I 'm going to throw up , " she says . Mark is lost in thought , scanning the high arched windows on the tower 's top floor for the initial tremor that will tell him whether the beams radiating out from the center of the roof like the spokes of a wheel have given way , whether the cantilever he has created by blowing out the two columns at the tower 's base has failed as planned , and whether the tower will , in fact , come down . " One . " Adrienne flicks the silver switch , and 25 milliseconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shot-floors with a quick succession of hard , thin bangs that echo like rifle reports among the nearby casinos . A few thin wisps of smoke curl out from the floors where the flashes went off . Nothing more happens . The tower stands against the neon-blue sky as the frozen lattice of time spreads out over the casinos and the crowd like a sheet of ice . As the detonator smoke fades , you can hear the stunned collective intake of breath , a hiss of surprise and disappointment rising up from the crowd . The lights of the city come filtering back in , and the same thought occurs to everyone here : nothing ever goes as planned . And there is not a single person here tonight who can honestly say that he did n't know the lesson all along . While the seconds fall one after another like water dripping from a faucet , the spectators groan , as if at the same moment they had all let go of the dream that brought them together here at two in the morning , the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breath with a wordless " AAWWW . " Turning to Mark , I see his eyes flicker as his attention shifts to the staircase and another , louder , series of explosions splits the silence like a train rushing down a track . Floor by floor the sleeping charges awaken , sending dark gray spumes of debris sideways out of the cylindrical shell of the tower . The atmospheric pressure swells inside our eardrums . As the dynamite bursts through the black-shrouded columns , the concrete floors fold in on one another like playing cards , and the sum of the horizontal components of the downward pull jerks the staircase away from the tower . Free from the exterior staircase , the tower buckles and melts away from the sky , undoing thirty years of static endurance in its slide toward the ground , and the rush of concrete and the crowd 's screaming merge in a moment of transcendent violence as the tower bursts open . It is an awesome , hallucinatory sight . The solid crust of expectations built up over years and months , hours and minutes-bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other individual disappointments-shatters , too , and the cries of the crowd lift out into the haze above Las Vegas Boulevard . The spectators surge forward , holding nothing back , throwing themselves at the tower as it ducks under the falling exterior staircase with elephantine grace . Released from the stable form imposed on it by architects and engineers , 22,302 tons of steel and concrete go rushing headlong to the ground , in the precise sequence Mark imagined when he looked up at the tower only moments ago . The impact of the event hangs suspended for an exhausted moment , broken only by the wailing of car alarms up and down the Strip . A cheer goes up and a dirty gray dust billows out from the place where the tower has settled , gaining in height and velocity as it rolls toward us . Gathering up the flashlight and the blasting machine in its worn leather case , we head for the parking lot , where Doug and Stacey stand before the cluster of lights , cameras , and fuzzy boom mikes , already answering questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the number of sticks of dynamite used and why the tower seemed to rotate and fall backward instead of straight down . Behind us the cloud approaches at surprising speed , as if , to shield the crowd from this forbidden glimpse of the destructive capacity slumbering away in all things , an angel had descended from heaven , squatted down on the thirty-foot mountain of rubble , and begun beating its wings . The Strip is alive with the aimless jangling excitement that you feel in a crowd outside a stadium after the big game , the lights too briht and the shouts too loud . In the alleyway on the other side of the wall , a white-haired man in a yellow plastic construction helmet , his brown tweed jacket festooned with security passes , stands with his eyes squeezed shut and an enormous pair of foam-rubber headphones clamped over his ears . He is grinning , delighted , stamping on the pavement faster and faster , as if the music inside his head had finally found an answer in the world outside . " Do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blow up my house . " The spell is broken . A passing film-student type dressed in black rushes out of the crowd , a shock of dyed red hair flopping over one eye and his other eye doing speedfreak pinwheels in its socket . " What movie is this for ? What 's the name of the movie ? " He ca n't get the idea out of his head : the collapse of an eighteen-story building only makes sense as a scene from movieland , where remarkable things happen all the time . " Hey , when is the movie coming out ? " The workmen look modestly around and say nothing , transformed by the magic of the blast from working stiffs into rock stars . Their proximity to the explosion , the concrete dust in their hair and on their clothes , is sexy . A translucent blonde in a white synthetic fur places a kittenish hand on the arm of David Williams , one of the drillers , and begs for a brick . He is not exactly sure how to respond . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get you a brick after we 're done . " As Adrienne 's crew removes the covering from the Denny 's window , another vision appears : At 2:00 A.Mt. the restaurant is packed with families , cab drivers , and casino workers on break ; and as the waitresses move from table to table , only a few of the diners look up at the window , glancing incuriously out at the workmen and the hole in the sky before returning to the GrandSlam breakfasts in front of them . Near the window , a large black man in a wide-brimmed hat and a full-length fur coat is sitting with three women , his left arm laid out over the red vinyl Denny 's banquette as he counts out his money on top of the check : a hard night 's work deserves its reward . As the workers roll up the cover in the alley , the crowd drifts off , some home to bed and some across the street to the Mirage in hopes of trading in their vision of the vanishing tower for a run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a graceful curve of masonry from the top of the tower has survived the fall nearly intact and sits atop a rounded hill of neatly fractured concrete as if placed there by design . The staircase is laid out over the rubble at a near-perfect fortyfive-degree angle : the newspapers will note tomorrow that even the dust remained on-site . " Come have a drink , " offers Doug , a companionable arm around my shoulder . After months of auctions and wrecking balls , and after a single vivid instant of destruction , one last part of the Sands still stands : the Aqueduct , a horseshoeshaped building decorated in mid-Sixties California modem , where Sheldon Adelson has his offices and where Sinatra used to stay in a luxury suite with a swimming pool and curved-glass doors . Tonight the third floor of the Aqueduct is home to Chuck Wilton , a white-haired seismologist who tested fallout shelters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the 1950s and has worked with Daddy Jack and his sons for years , measuring the impact of their blasts on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then pops a tape into the VCR . " Perfect . Beautiful , " Mark says as he watches the flashes of light and then , much faster than it seemed the first time , the answering roar of the explosives as the tower ducks under the staircase and the picture in Mark 's head achieves its congruence with the picture onscreen . " Let 's see that again , " says Doug . The brothers were so busy watching the high arched windows for the first tremors of motion that neither of them really saw the tower come down . He stops the tape and rewinds . " Watch the front of the hotel . " And as the tower falls , you can see hundreds of firefly camera flashes lighting up the facade of the Treasure Island casino across the street from the Sands in spontaneous tribute to the brothers and their work . As the tension of the previous days and hours drains away , the brothers sip their scotch and the conversation wanders . The potbellied explosives handler from Vermont , with a heavy beard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the family again . The pickup worker from a previous job in the Southwest who wanted to be part of the crew too badly and never shut up , will not . His head slumped back against the varnished veneer of the television cabinet , Doug talks about the great game of golf he has planned for tomorrow . Mark talks about the plans to blow up the Hacienda on New Year 's Eve . Then it 's on to the Clifton stack in Arizona , the power station in Madras , the missile pads in Belarus , and other used-up branches of the evolutionary process whose deeper ends remain hidden from our eyes but whose agents the Loizeaux surely are . Three weeks from now the rubble that was the Sands will be gone , and the illusion of a fresh start will vanish , too , as Sheldon Adelson 's dream of a Venice-in-the-desert assumes its inevitable earthly form . Tonight , however , walking through the parking lot , the lights of the Mirage shining through the empty place in the sky where the Sands once stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dust has lifted , a fresh breeze is blowing in from the desert mountains , and , for the moment at least , anything is possible . Footnote 1 The Street Occupancy Permit obtained from the Neva da Department of Transportation allows CDI to close down Las Vegas Boulevard on the night of the implosion . The Special Events Permit , signed by Clark County officials , licenses CDI to conduct operations that may create a public disturbance . The Blasting Permit from the Clark County Fire Department enables CDI to utilize explosives . The Air Quality Permit ensures that the blast will not adversely affect the air of Las Vegas .
