<p> Crusading Planned Parenthood President Faye Wattleton . <p> Bare-knuckled biographer Kitty Kelley . <p> Strangest-named actress ever to win an Oscar Whoopi Goldberg . <p> A shaved-headed former naval officer . An ex-correspondent for NBC News in El Salvador . A onetime mayor of Cincinnati . <p> Is there anyone left in America who is n't trying to launch a talk show ? <p> Apparently not . Jesse Jackson , whose syndicated show was announced with much fanfare and canceled with much less after one season , is giving talk another try ; his latest attempt premiered this month on CNN . Blustery right-wing pontificator Rush Limbaugh , not content with a radio show said to have more than 7 million listeners on 400-plus stations , wants to star in a late-night half-hour , with Roger Ailes as executive producer . " The Dennis Miller Show , " starring the " Saturday Night Live " comic , made its debut last night . <p> " It spreads like herpes , " says Jack Fentress , vice president and programming director of Petry National Television , which handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a best-selling author or a successful actor , Fentress says , " there 's more money making talk shows , and it 's less work . And you could be the one who breaks through . " <p> Dreaming that very dream , many of the aforementioned wannahosts are converging on New Orleans for the annual syndication bazaar  --  officially the National Association of Television Programming Executives ( NATPE ) convention  --  that begins today . They 'll play meet the press , shake lots of hands and pose for Polaroids with station managers from Fresno and Schenectady who hold their fates in their hands . Syndicators want to sell new shows to enough stations to reach roughly 80 percent of the U.S. population before they begin production . Even when they get that " coverage , " the mortality rate is high . <p> You think it 's easy to get viewers to tune in for yet another group confession of compulsive ( insert vice of your choice ) or the umpteenth sort-of star touting a film clip ? Last year 's high hopes included Chuck Woolery , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and whose Group W-syndicated talk show lasted less than five months ; his final rerun will be seen Friday . Ron Reagan is another casualty ; MCA , now putting its bets on Kelley , recently pulled the plug on his serious-issues hour . " Jenny Jones , " a Warner Bros. entry , has had weak ratings and may or may not get enough station renewals to survive for a second year . As each hopeful totters , though , a crop of new , sometimes even more unlikely candidates tries to elbow its way onto the airwaves . <p> This is all Oprah 's fault . Not only did she supplant Phil Donahue as the nation 's most-watched talk host in 1986 , she negotiated a deal that made would-be talkers salivate : Through her production company , Winfrey owns her show ( distributed by King World , syndicator of " Wheel of Fortune " ) , and her current annual take is estimated by trade publications at $ 35 million or so . Other big-name hosts , though not in that league , get a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hourly wage for defending abortion rights or assaulting the British royal family ( Kelley 's next literary subject , it 's been announced ) ca n't compare . And while the gig 's not simple , the required credentials  --  applicants need not be able to write , sing , act , throw a slider or define GNP  --  are few . <p> Syndicators drool too . Talk , as they say , is cheap , probably in the $ 100,000- to $ 250,000-a-week range for five shows , estimates John von Soosten , vice president and programming director for Katz Communications , adviser to about 200 stations . Magazine and " reality " - based shows  --  " Hard Copy , " for instance  --  are more expensive , requiring film crews and producers . Game shows are comparatively low-cost but considered a riskier proposition ; a bunch were launched two NATPEs ago and all crashed and burned . Oprah is " what everybody wants to be , what every distributor dreams of , " Fentress says . <p> Hence , though Planned Parenthood staffers were staggered two weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 184,000-a-year job , a Hollywood agent/entrepreneur was showing syndicators videotapes last spring of her appearances on " Nightline " and other talk shows . She signed with the folks who bring you Geraldo Rivera and Joan Rivers ( and now Dennis Miller ) , Tribune Entertainment in Chicago , which owns six television stations and thus could provide the local seasoning a novice needs . " It will not be a national show in the beginning , " says Greg Miller , Tribune 's vice president for program development . " We have to go through a certain period of training and development . " <p> Telegenic , articulate and famously poised , Wattleton will have to soft-pedal some of the political sensibilities honed during her long leadership of the campaign to keep abortion legal . Successful talk-show hosts " tend not to take a strong point of view because that can alienate the viewer at home , " says Jim Curtin of HRP Inc. , another firm that monitors developments in syndication . " If you take talk shows as an intellectual experience , you miss the point ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Miller emphasized that Wattleton 's show , to focus on " women 's issues , " would not be " a sounding board for her personal viewpoints . That 's not the kind of television we 're involved with . " <p> Another potential problem is that despite her high profile in politico-media circles , " very few people in Dallas know who Faye Wattleton is , " says John E. Goldhammer . Of course , Goldhammer would say that ; he 's senior vice president of program development for MCA TV , which made a lunge for Kitty Kelley in the midst of last spring 's Nancy Reagan mania . After some coaching on how to look into the lens and e-nun-ci-ate , she 's slated to take to the air in September . <p> Goldhammer readily concedes that viewers may not particularly cotton to Kelley , that she 's " famous , notorious , infamous , all of that , " but he claims it does n't matter . " What 's clear from the research is , people who like her will tune in and people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to . " <p> Kelley 's one-hour pilot , being shown to potential buyers at NATPE , explores the ever-riveting issue of which member or members of the Jackson clan is or are liars about sexual abuse etc. ; the buzz , as they say in the biz , is good . It features Kelley , on a book-lined set said to be inspired by her Georgetown study , interviewing LaToya Jackson , parents Joe and Katherine , brother Jackie Jackson 's ex-wife , a mystery guest behind a curtain and Bob Guccione Jr . of Spin magazine . As of late last week MCA had announced no " clearances " ( i.e. , sales to local stations ) , but it may be keeping its deals quiet until NATPE , where syndicators like to post their market-by-market conquests , the better to create an impression of irresistible momentum . <p> Other entrants in the daytime talk sweepstakes include : <p> Vicki Lawrence , star of the syndicated " Mama 's Family " and longtime Carol Burnett sidekick . " Vicki ! "  --  chat format , living room set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needs more , but Lawrence , blessed with high Q scores ( meaning people like her ) and a name ending in a vowel ( see Arsenio , Vanna , Geraldo ) , may connect . <p> Montel Williams , hairless former Navy lieutenant commander ( helped invade Grenada ) who spent two years as a " motivational speaker , " admonishing kids to finish school and resist drugs , before being discovered . Uses the Donahue/Oprah formula : single topic ( recent example , women in love with death-row inmates ) , audience participation . In a slow " roll-out , " having started on nine stations last fall , now " cleared " on 39 . Poised ( Viacom fervently hopes ) for national release . <p> Jerry Springer , Cincinnati council member who survived mid- ' 70s revelations about an interlude with a prostitute ( he paid by check ) to be elected mayor , then became an Emmy-winning local news anchor and commentator . Broadcast , also in slow roll-out , closes with Springer advising , " Till next time , take care of yourself and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe " hopefuls eager to take on Arsenio in the post-Carson era , among them : <p> Goldberg , said by industry sources to be guaranteed several million dollars her first year . " No band , no sidekick , no opening monologue , just Whoopi and one guest " for half an hour , says spokesman for syndicator Genesis . Goldberg 's wish list of interviewees includes Streisand , Swayze and Tutu . Already sold to 53 stations . <p> Limbaugh , pudgy radio phenom . Executive producer Ailes , before he was famous for electing Republicans , produced " The Mike Douglas Show . " Half-hour show will eschew guests in favor of Limbaugh 's patented commentary inspired by news clips , blasts at liberals and responses to viewers who send in questions via home videos . <p> Jane Whitney , D.C. resident , veteran of Philadelphia chat shows , and " Entertainment Tonight " reporter-producer before joining NBC News . An hour-long " topical reality " show beginning regional roll-out in March . <p> Notice that all of the above are reasonably , in some cases wildly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since not all of them will get to be TV talk-show hosts , at least not for very long . It does raise the specter , though , of the talk show as ultimate validation : Whatever else you 've done/won/run , you have n't really scored until you 're in people 's living rooms five days a week , interviewing celebrities or ( on Oprah last week ) " Mothers and Fathers Who Kill . " <p> Syndicated TV is a cyclical game . The talk boom will run its course , as happened during the earlier era of Merv , Mike and Dinah . Producers will be scrambling to reinvent game shows or find another relatively low-rent way to fill an hour , and would-be hosts may find other aspirations . <p> Not all of them , however . It 's getting to be one of those ambitions you hear beauty queens simper about , a universal fantasy . " It does feed the ego , " says Curtin . " Good money , and you get to rule the roost . You could do worse . "
