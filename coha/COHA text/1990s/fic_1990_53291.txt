WE WERE DRUNK . At least JoAnn was , and when she got drunk I always acted drunk too . I could n't help myself We were in the woods at the end of August , and she was getting ready to throw up . <p> " Stick your finger down your throat , " I said . " That 's what my mother always does . " <p> " That do n't work for me , " said JoAnn , and right then she chucked it up . It was just pretzels and a cheese sandwich she bought at the store , but it made a mess . When she was done I kicked dead leaves over it . <p> " Pretty gross , " I said . <p> " That 's what it looks like in your stomach , " she said . " Get used to it . " <p> I did n't like to think what things looked like in my stomach . I got fainty enough to go to the nurse every time they started to talk about blood and guts in biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ran away from the doctor when he pulled out his needle to give me a booster . Not because I was scared but because I could n't stand to think of that stuff shooting into my veins . So I had had a hard time of it when JoAnn told me , in April , that she 'd gone and gotten herself pregnant . <p> " Are you positive ? " I 'd said . " Maybe you just missed your period . " <p> " I 've put on ten pounds , and this morning I threw up . I was n't even drinking last night . " <p> " Maybe you 're sick , " I 'd said . " I miss my period all the time . " <p> " Me , never . " <p> I figured she was right , JoAnn weighing what she did . The doctor 'd told me my periods had stopped because I was too skinny . He made me promise to eat two slices of toast every morning and to stop skipping lunch . I did n't tell him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every month just thinking about what was going on inside me . But JoAnn was fat . <p> We 'd gotten drunk to celebrate her second trimester of no one knowing . At first she 'd been going to get an abortion . " They just suck it out of you , " she 'd told me . " Like sticking a vacuum cleaner up you . Except if you do it too early there might be something left . Like a toe or a fanny , multiplying itself in there . Then they have to do it again . " <p> I stoppered my ears . I could n't stand to listen to JoAnn sometimes . Her whole family was like that , the biggest mouths outside Windhaven . They lived right downtown , next to the store , and you could go by on a Saturday and hear them . I was down there a lot after school let out for summer , listening to them talk about the lady who 'd laid herself across the train tracks and covered herself with brush so the train would n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Found it down by Winston 's stockyard , " said her uncle , who was as fat as JoAnn only bigger , " a good thousand feet from the rest of her . And you want to know what happened to her legs ? " <p> " No , " I said from a corner of their porch . <p> " Well , why not ? The lady 's dead , she do n't care . Let me tell you just where her legs got tangled up . " <p> " It is gross , " I said . <p> " Hoo ! " said JoAnn 's mother . " I should think it would be . God 's got his ways with women like that . I hear she had a devil in her , took a cleaver to her child when it was five , got one of his fingers . Her people are all nuts , I hear , Catholics . " <p> Those were the kind of stories they told , out loud on their porch , as many as eight of them laughing their own heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in the store and be telling Mr. Gray , and you 'd just scoot in and out , but they 'd always catch you , their fat hands coming down on your shoulder to stay you a minute while their bellies bumped up against the counter . They were always buying beer . JoAnn and I got started picking it up for them . We 'd tell Mr. Gray it was for her uncle or her more , and he 'd sell to us . We could n't pick it up for my mother , she was a rummy , and Mr. Gray knew it . <p> But I liked JoAnn , and I admired the way she could drink . She told me the first time we went out in the woods that she slept with boys , too , and I admired the way she could do that and not care . " I made sure it did n't hurt the first time , " she said . " I went and got a broom handle and smeared it with Vaseline and stuck it up me . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly felt it at all . " <p> " How long does it take them ? " I asked . I was looking close at her hips , trying to see if they 'd got wider . I had this impression that you had to spread yourself out somehow to fit them in , and you could never quite close up again . But JoAnn was so fat I could n't tell a difference . Now me , my hips might break . <p> " Only a few minutes , usually . But Matt McPeck  --  you know him , they held him back a year-he kept it up for something like half an hour . I was sore I tell you . That was not fun . " <p> It was only because JoAnn was so fat that she did n't have a reputation . None of the boys she slept with wanted to admit to anyone that they 'd done it to her . But she always found them , all right . They were always willing . " Where d' you go ? " I asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with Jimmy- " she looked around and pointed , " right under that pine tree there . Nice and soft . " She smiled , remembering , I guess . " I figure God gave me this body , " she said , " so I could do something with it . " <p> " Well , you did something all right . " <p> She thought it was Matt McPeck who 'd got her pregnant , but she could n't be sure . At first she was going to get the money for the abortion from him . The day he turned her down was the only time I ever saw JoAnn cry . We were having lunch at the mall in Windhaven , across the " For Sale " field from school . You were n't supposed to leave the grounds , but everyone did who could afford it . JoAnn 'd told her dad there was a field trip , and got three bucks , enough for her cheeseburger deluxe and my Diet Coke . " He says , " she told me while she cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anyhow I told him I was fixed . " <p> " Did you ? " I said . <p> " Sure I did ! " Her voice went up just like her family 's . <p> " Ssh , " I said . I looked around . The place opened right onto the mall , and there were kids parading up and down  --  kids not just from Windhaven but the hamlet too . " Well , he ca n't say he did n't do it with you , " I whispered . " So it 'd have to be a little bit his fault . They say even when you are fixed you can get pregnant . So he could give you a little , and Jimmy could give you a little , and  --  " <p> " Whaddayou think I am , some church benefit ? " JoAnn cried out . " Nobody even wants to admit they 've touched me , you 've got to have at least two hundred bucks for an abortion , whaddayou think I do , turn tricks ? " <p> " Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the money then . Just do n't yell about it like you were something in the papers , JoAnn . Jesus . " <p> But I could n't get the money . The only way I could 've done it was to rob the store or something . My mother does n't ever keep more than a five in her purse , and I have n't got any brothers or sisters to steal from like JoAnn does . I thought about selling stuff I owned to kids in school , but I added it all up and only came to about forty bucks . <p> " It do n't matter , " said JoAnn . " I 'd just as soon have it as get sucked out anyhow . " <p> " But your mom , " I said . JoAnn 's mom was a Bible-thumper , everybody in the hamlet knew that . She drove around with bumper stickers saying " Save the Unborn " and " Let God Go to School " plastered all over her car . She had n't let JoAnn 's older sister go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd gone along , sitting there weighing down the backseat while JoAnn 's sister and the date tried to watch a drive-in . JoAnn 's sister had run off and got married the same year JoAnn and I started drinking . JoAnn said she did n't intend ever to go on a date , she 'd just keep slipping out her window and meeting boys in the woods . You got the feeling that if JoAnn 's mother knew she was pregnant , she 'd make like the lady who laid herself on the tracks  --  aim at JoAnn with a cleaver . <p> " She do n't have to know , " said JoAnn . <p> " What do you mean . You 'll show . " <p> " No , I wo n't . Fat people do n't so much , and if I just keep gaining weight all over they wo n't know the difference . We were all teeny babies , my Mom said . No more than six pounds any of us . I figure six pounds wo n't make a hill of beans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time we were celebrating the end of her second trimester , I had to hand it to JoAnn . She 'd pigged out for four months and was just fat everywhere . Her mother was so mad she 'd made her let out all her own clothes . Matt McPeck had n't breathed a word . We used to run into him at the store while we were picking up the beer or something more for JoAnn to eat . He just swaggered down the aisle and said , " Hey , girls , " like he had n't been held back at all , but was out of school and working already . Maybe he thought JoAnn had got the money somewhere and had it out . JoAnn had n't gone in the woods with him since he turned her down , but I had to hand it to her , she 'd done it with a couple of other guys before she finally got too embarrassed to take off her clothes . " What the hell , at least I 'm safe now , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , JoAnn . You can hurt it doing that stuff . " <p> We 'd gone like that , from talking about aborting it to taking care of it , like we had adopted a secret pet . I stole a couple of pints of milk out of the store and made JoAnn drink them so the baby 's bones would n't rot . After she threw up her cheese sandwich in the woods I said I would n't drink beer with her till the baby was born . But all that time we did n't talk about how it was going to be born , or what we were . going to do with it then . <p> I almost let the secret slip once , to Mr. Gray , who ran . the store . I had to go there sometimes to use the phone when I forgot my keys and my mother was working late . Both my parents worked all day , but for some reason I could never figure out , we never had any money to spend , while parents like JoAnn 's were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just something wrong with us , some trick my parents were too dumb to figure out . <p> During the summer , when I forgot my key , I 'd just hang out after school at JoAnn 's . But her uncle was getting divorced that fall , and all they talked about was what a bitch her fat aunt was . I 'd rather have listened to their disgusting stories than hear them complain about her bad coffee and how she 'd poured it once on JoAnn 's uncle 's nuts . So I 'd go on to the store , where I could see our house out the window , and when it was raining I 'd stay there till my mother 's car pulled up in our drive . Mr. Gray knew everybody and everything that went on in the hamlet  --  which is n't to say a lot , this being about the most boring place on the earth , but still you wanted to stay on his good side . <p> " Brain food , " he said to me , holding out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your body 's living off its memory banks , forgetting your keys so much . " <p> " No , thank you , " I said , real polite . " I 'm not allowed snacks after three o'clock . " Which was a lie , but I could n't see taking food from him when I 'd stolen that milk . <p> " I 've seen you in here after three , " he said . <p> " That was for JoAnn , " I said . " Or her family , " I added quickly , remembering the beer . <p> " She 's getting to be quite a porker , that girl , " he said . <p> " People are just different , " I said . " It runs in her family , my room says . " <p> Mr. Gray spun the Twizzler with his thumb and first finger . He looked at me like I was an adult , like he knew I knew something . " I used to see her , " he said , " climbing out her window at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , sir , " I said . <p> " Have n't seen her at it last few months . Maybe she 's gotten too fat to get through . Shame for a young girl to let herself go like that . " <p> " JoAnn ai n't let herself go , " I said , not very loud . " Has n't she ? Seems to me she 's just lazy . Girls get fat like that early in life , they have problems later on . Having babies and such . " <p> " JoAnn 's not going to- " I started , but then I looked up and saw his beady eyes on . me . " Get fat , " I finished . " We 're going on a diet together after Halloween . Excuse me , there 's my more . " <p> I did n't see any car , and he looked up and saw I did n't , but he let me go out in the rain . I felt like I was burning up . My legs would n't carry me away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure what a right thing JoAnn had done , deciding to have the baby and then getting herself fat , so she would n't have to explain to anyone . That 's the problem with this stupid lit fie village . Everything wants explaining , as if we had the whole world , right here , to set down and figure out . <p> That last month JoAnn was cool and sweet as a cucumber , even though her face had broken out from the candy she 'd stuffed herself with and she 'd had to stick gussets in all the clothes she 'd let out already . When I asked her where she planned to have the kid , she just stared me down . <p> " You know , " I said . " What hospital . Do n't you have to do it in a hospital ? " <p> " You think , " she said , " I made myself into one gigantic pillow to hide this thing just to waltz into some hospital and let the whole world know ? " <p> " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We could take the bus down to Castleton and find some place there . You could give a phony name . Nobody 'll care so long as you 're white . I heard my father say people 're paying ten thousand dollars for white babies these days , they 're not going to ask questions . " <p> " Boy are you stupid , " JoAnn said . It was creepy , by now , to watch her face when she talked to me . Her cheeks had gotten so big that her mouth just seemed like a little red hole in between them , and when her lips moved they always acted like they were sucking something . " First of all , " she said , holding out her thumb to count , " you have to pay money just to walk into a hospital . " <p> " That 's not true . There 's the emergency room , they ca n't turn you out if you 're unconscious . " <p> " But having a baby ai n't an emergency . You have to have medical insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't just walk in . So that 's second , your own doctor , which I do n't got . " Out shot her index finger . <p> " I got a doctor , " I said . " I hate him , but he might be good at babies . <p> My mother takes me there because I do n't get my periods . He wants me to get fat . He 'd love you . " <p> JoAnn made a noise with her lips . " Sure , a guy who knows the whole hamlet , that 's just what we need . Thirdly , " she held up her fuck finger , " you ca n't just take a bus to the hospital to have your baby , like you were going to the dentist . You ca n't decide to have your baby at all . Your baby decides when you 're going to have it , and then you go into labor whether you like it or not , and it 's all over . " <p> I was smarter than JoAnn at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things she was pointing out to me . But I do n't have any sisters or brothers , and I always stopped listening when they started on people 's insides in biology . I hated for JoAnn to make me feel dumb . It was like the first time she got us a joint to smoke with the beer . She told me to open my mouth after I 'd dragged on it , and when I did , all the smoke just poured out because I had n't inhaled . She 'd laughed and laughed , and I 'd hated her . <p> " Fourthly , " JoAnn was starting now , but I grabbed her fat hand and pulled it down . I could get mad sometimes , so mad I was like a guy when he gets drunk and wants to fistfight . <p> " Just exactly how , " I asked her , my hand still wrapped around her wrist , " do you plan on having the thing , then ? Or are you still gon na kill it ? " <p> " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of a mouth working . " All by myself . Except you 'll help me . Remember those Indian women we read about in history ? Who dropped their papooses right there in the field and kept on going ? Well , I figure if they can do it so can I. " <p> " JoAnn , I ca n't , " I said . I could feel my face go white . I was n't mad anymore . <p> " Whaddayou mean , you ca n't ? All you have to do is hold hot towels and cut the umbilical cord when it pops out . " <p> " Do n't talk about it . Please . " I 'd dropped her wrist . I bent my head to my knees . <p> " Look , I 've got this book about it . It 's got real photographs , it shows you how your cervix dilates , and the amni-something fluid  --  " <p> " Do n't . " My head was getting light . We were sitting out on the school steps , and I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me faint , " I said . " Jesus , JoAnn , I always figured you 'd have a doctor there . I 'd be lousy at it . I mean , what if you had some kind of problem  --  " <p> " I am not gon na have any problems , " said JoAnn , talking into the wind . " My mother never had any problems , and I am very young . Anyhow , I 'd rather die than go anywhere where I had to tell them who I WAS . " <p> " Lots of girls have babies , JoAnn . " <p> " Yeah , but they all do it to get their boyfriends . They are n't ugly to start with , like me . " <p> I 'd never thought till then that JoAnn knew she was ugly . <p> Soon as she gave me her book , I was in for it . I 'd stay up late at night , sitting on the john in case I got sick , and I managed to read a couple of pages at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them in classes , but I 'd never had to look before . Now I started to think maybe JoAnn was wrong about this whole thing . Maybe she was just fat . Maybe she 'd been lying to me the whole time . She 'd had her periods , right on time , only she wanted to put on all that weight and she was embarrassed because I was her best friend and I was skinny . That was it . She was no more pregnant than me . None of the pictures fit with anything I knew about JoAnn . She just could not have all those things going on inside her . Somebody would 've known by now . There were supposed to be all these signs . <p> Still , I did something that I thought was real generous and real clever . Trying to break the habit of being poor that my parents had got into , I 'd pocketed a lot of money from baby-sitting Mr. Gray 's foster kids over the summer . By the time I saved it , it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have spent it that way if I 'd had it in time . counted up the exact number of days from when JoAnn told me she 'd done it with Matt McPeck , and got the week after Thanksgiving . I added a day before and a day after . Then I called the Outer Haven motel , which is only about two miles from the hamlet , and I made a reservation for three nights . I gave the guy a phony name . " You 'll have to send us a deposit , or MasterCard or Visa , " he said . <p> " How much for ? " I asked . <p> " One night in advance , " he said , as if I should 've known . <p> " What if we do n't get there by that night ? What if we get there on the second night ? Can we use up the advance then ? " <p> " If you fail to appear by one A.M. on the first night of your reservation , you forfeit the deposit and the reservation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , trying to sound like it was some kind of math problem  --  I just had to come up with the right solution  --  " if I want to be sure to get the room all three nights , I got to pay you up front for all three nights . " <p> " That is correct . " <p> " Well , how much is that ? " I said . <p> " For three nights , single occupancy or double ? " I had to think a second . " Single , " I said finally . Only JoAnn was going to use the bed . " That comes to one hundred and twenty-three dollars with the tax . " " Okay , " I said . I had a hundred fifty left from summer , mostly because I had n't told JoAnn I had it . " Can I send you a money order from the post office ? " <p> " A postal money order is acceptable . " <p> So then I had to go through it all at the post office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know me , but still the lady kept saying , " Outer Haven Motel ? Did you say motel , dearie ? " and I was positive someone from our class was going to walk in any second . But I finally got it off . <p> When I woke up , the first day of our reservation , I was real excited . I chattered so much at breakfast I was almost through a second piece of toast before I remembered I 'd sworn I 'd never do what that doctor said . Then I ate the rest anyway . My Morn stopped right in the middle of getting ready for work and asked me if I had a project or something at school today , I was so excited and I 'd eaten . <p> " Well , sure , " I said . " A science project . JoAnn and me are doing a demonstration . " <p> " I wish I could come see it , " my more said , almost like she meant it . <p> " No , you do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , and then I giggled to myself all the way to school . <p> When JoAnn and I went to the mall at lunch I thought she looked paler than normal . " How do you feel ? " I asked her . " You gon na have it ? " <p> " Shit , I do n't know , " she said . " I sure wish it 'd drop soon . I feel like some kinda whale . " <p> " Well , you do n't look like you 're gon na have a baby , " I said . I was still testing her a little . " You just look fat . " <p> " Tell the baby that , " she said , and then she did n't say anything much more . I did n't see her all afternoon , and later when we went to get her a candy bar at Gray 's she would n't talk about it . My mother kept asking me at dinner about my science project , and I guess I was so nasty she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as I could keep my eyelids open , waiting for JoAnn to ping my window with a rock , but she never did . I had n't told her about the motel . I was going to just whisk her off there as soon as her labor started . But the whole night went by and she did n't get me . <p> The next day was about the same . In the afternoon I started to tell JoAnn about the motel  --  I thought maybe knowing she had somewhere to go would bring it on quicker . But as soon as I started with , " You know , when you get the first pain , " she said , " Oh , ca n't you shut up about it ! I gave you the book to read , just read it and know your stuff and do n't ask reel " So I shut up . <p> I called the motel just once , on the third day , to ask if there was any way I could get a refund . " If you would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's voice said , " I think I could persuade the manager to let you have one night 's charges back . " <p> I figured it out quick : forty dollars and seventy-five cents . Then I figured that if I canceled , with my luck JoAnn would go into labor right after dinner . " That 's all right , " I said , trying to sound old and rich so the forty bucks did n't matter , " we might make it tonight after all . " <p> She finally had it on the weekend . I could not believe it even when it was happening . I kept saying to myself , " This is real , this is real , " under my breath , so that I would n't think it was some dream and I did n't have to do anything . I was in Mr. Gray 's store first thing Saturday getting a pack of cigarettes when JoAnn came in and grabbed me by the wrist , real hard . Her forehead was all sweaty , and her pimples were bright red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got ta come with me , " she said . <p> " Okay , " I said , though it was like someone else saying it . I left the cigarettes on Mr. Gray 's counter . " I had a motel reservation , " I said when we were outside , " but it 's canceled out now . " <p> She acted like she did n't hear me . " We got ta go to the woods , " she said . " Listen . Can you go stand outside my window and I 'll push my blankets out to you ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . " What does it feel like , JoAnn ? You sure this is it ? " She still did n't hear . She was looking around the street like she expected someone to walk down it and shoot her . " What about hot water ? " I said . <p> " I filled up this enormous thermos my room takes to the auxiliary , " she said . " It 's  --  ouch , shit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs you go grab it . " <p> " Was that a contraction , JoAnn ? " I asked . But she 'd gone off already , toward her house . I was just some kind of tool to her now , not even like another person . I went to get the thermos and washrag , waited underneath the window , caught the blankets when they tumbled down . I wondered if Mr. Gray was watching us  --  Lord knows JoAnn 's folks were n't , they were just sitting on that front porch going on about the cop who shot a black girl down in Castleton  --  but I did n't look around to see . JoAnn got down the back way and we headed for the woods . Every now and then she had to stop , and she 'd lean on me while the labor passed . I practically keeled over with the weight of the blankets and the thermos and then JoAnn gripping my arm . But I bent my knees and held tight , and we made it . <p> She had the baby on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't describe how loud she yelled . She yelled like she was ripping her body apart  --  her fat body rolling around in those blankets on those soft pine needles . I just kept dipping the washrag and applying it to her belly and her face , and sometimes when she was n't yelling she asked if she could suck on it a little . I was just sure , when she started screaming , that somebody would come . I wanted somebody to come . If somebody did n't come JoAnn might kill herself and I could n't do anything about it . I could n't believe nobody was coming to help a person yelling like this . Even if they thought it was an animal they ought to come . I wanted to run away from the screaming and get help but I was the only one there and every time I moved JoAnn screamed , " No ! Shit ! Do n't leave reel I 'm gon na die ! " So I stayed . <p> There was a lot of blood . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the pink flowered sheets and soaking into the blanket . She was screaming good by then . " Sit up , " I kept telling her , " lemme hold up your legs , " but it was like she did n't hear me . I did n't have enough arms to hold up all the parts of her you were supposed to hold up . Then I saw it , right in there like horseshit when it 's about to come out of a horse 's rump , only this was between JoAnn 's spread legs . <p> " It 's him , " I said to her . My mouth was so dry I could hardly talk . " I see his head , JoAnn . Push , JoAnn . " <p> She screamed the worst of all then , and the part behind her birth canal ripped like wet paper only bloody . Then I had the head in my hands . <p> I did just like the book said . I might 've had it in front of my eyes , I remembered it all so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wipe it first , and clear the spit out of the mouth . Then you turned it a little at the shoulders , keeping hold of the head till the feet made it . Shake it so it breathes , then it flushes all red and cries . Trailing out from the middle of it , the bright bloody rope that I was going to have to cut somehow , beating like a heart . I waited till it stopped and then I did what I had to , I gnawed it off , the queer taste of blood in my mouth , and tied it with a string I had in my pocket . You were supposed to put the baby on the mother 's belly , but JoAnn was still thrashing around . Then came the placenta , which I had to make sure she got all out . <p> My heart came in two when I heard him cry . " God , " I said . Then he gurgled and cried some more . It was n't like any other kind of animal you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was so gorgeous . <p> " Give me my baby , " JoAnn said . I 'd almost forgotten about her , way up there by the trunk of the pine . She sounded caved in . <p> " Sure , " I said . I took the washrag from the thermos and wiped off the blood and mucus sticking to him all over . Then I held him by the head and fanny and walked up on my knees to show him to her . <p> Her face was so fat I ca n't say it shriveled up when she saw him . But it did something to get all at once real old . Her cheeks rose up and squeezed against her eyes , and her mouth turned upside down . I knelt there holding the baby . She did n't move her arms . <p> " I hate it ! " she yelled . " Get it out of here ! " <p> " It 's your baby , JoAnn , " I said . " It 's a boy . " <p> " Not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! It 's horrible ! I 'm horrible ! God , I wish I 'd died ! " <p> And she turned her face away . <p> Just like I 'd known what to do when she started to have the baby , I knew what to do now . I wrapped him in a pillowcase we 'd brought and set him for a minute over on a mound of pine needles . I saw to the afterbirth , made sure JoAnn was cleaned out good . She was still bleeding a lot , but that was n't going to kill her . I tucked the blankets around her . <p> " You stay here and rest , " I said . " You 're all done . I 'll be back . " <p> " You going to kill it ? " she whispered at me . She turned her face to me again , and I never saw a face so ugly . The fat on it was all dead , and her mouth looked like it was going to spit . " Kill it ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too heavy for her and I had to lift it off . <p> " Sure , JoAnn , " I said . " You stay here now . " <p> It was early yet . I picked the baby up . He was n't crying now , just making sweet little gurgly sounds . His purple mouth was working and I stuck my pinky at it , and he sucked . I carried him back to town , all set to sling him under my arm like he was a bundle of old clothes if I passed anybody . When I got to my house I just nipped upstairs and got the big canvas bag my mom gave me for my birthday , and stuffed another pillowcase and a towel into it and set him on top . Nobody in my house caught me till I was out the gate , and then it was just my dad . He called out , " You eating lunch today , Skinny ? " and I yelled back , " Going shopping ! " and then I was free . <p> There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday . I sat right down in the back and peeked in at the baby the whole way . He 'd gone off to sleep , but he kept breathing ; I stuck my finger under his nose about every thirty seconds to check . Everyone else who got on sat at the front . I heard them talking about their daughters and their sons and how Christmas was around the corner , and I just kept my eyes down figuring they 'd take me for a loony but never for a mother . <p> I thought once or twice about JoAnn lying out there in the woods . But she was n't going to die . She 'd done just what she said she was going to do , drop her kid like some Indian squaw , and now she could just do like a squaw and keep on going . <p> I rode the bus past Windhaven , past the mall and the factory , all the way down to where we started taking on Saturday workers going into Castleton . " Whatcha got there , a bufday cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he snickered like he did n't expect an answer anyhow , and he stood by the back door hanging onto the strap . I did n't get off till we 'd hit the main mall in Castleton , and then I walked cool as you please right onto the concourse . <p> They were going to set up Santa after lunch , there at the end of the mall , with a stage and plastic trimming and a red rope for the line of kids . On the top step , right below where Santa 's feet would go , there were all these boxes wrapped up like presents . I did n't even look around me  --  it 'd be a dead giveaway , I decided on the bus , to look around . I just lifted the towels and pillowcases and baby at once out of the canvas bag and set them down in the middle of those bright empty boxes . He did n't even start to cry again for a bit . <p> Then I hid myself . What I mean is , I went shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where Santa would go and then in the one to the left . I 'd folded up my canvas bag so no one 'd think I was shoplifting . When they asked if they could help me , I gave them a nice skinny-girl smile and said , " Just shopping for Christmas . " Then they left me alone , like they thought I was underfed so I would n't spend much . Between shops I walked up and down the mall like everybody else , except not getting too far from Santa . <p> It was twelve-thirty . Just when I thought I 'd have to keep myself hid till one when Santa came , the baby gave out a big cry . Bigger than anything he 'd done in the woods , and so pretty he broke my heart again . It was all I could do not to run to him . I thought I would , too , but this lady with a perm came tearing out of the store I 'd been in first and bee-lined right for the baby . <p> " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , help ! It 's a newborn child ! Oh , thank God ! It 's alive ! " <p> Then the whole mall , practically , swarmed over there , though you could still hear JoAnn 's baby crying above the rest of them . I melted back into another shop , and out the parking lot entrance before I could even take another look . I could n't of stood another look . Out on the parking lot , of course , no one had heard the lady inside , so they were just walking around with their purses and their bags like any Saturday . I followed a whole gang back toward the bus stop , but I hardly took account of them . I had to concentrate to remember JoAnn , lying bleeding in her afterbirth back in the woods outside Windhaven . All I knew was I was hungry , and I only had enough for the bus fare back . <p> <p> By LUCY FERRISS <p>                    @
