ContentsSuch a Solid House Beauty # Starting a War <p> THE LINE BETWEEN gray sky and gray ocean was a thread . It stretched tight and held them apart , alone . There was a difference between them that Lelia knew : one you breathed , the other you drowned . Some days seemed not to have the thread , and then one was the other . <p> There was a cold glass between her and outside . She lay there on her shelf looking out the rear window first at the sea and then at the drugstore beside it , then at the line on the drugstore that would open and be a door when they came out . They still did n't come out . Ages and aeons passed . She drew her fog back in and watched its edges retreat on the glass . If she drew a person on the door line and breathed deep enough would it come out of the door into her ? She made some circles with eyes and legs and a mouth . It would n't come when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and could n't quite hear the ocean . <p> Her legs were cold and her coat itchy where they touched . How long did someone have to obey for Sunday funnies and an ice cream cone ? She slid off her shelf and down the woolly backseat and out of the car . She went straight to the glass door . It was heavy but she opened a crack to squeeze through and started for the chrome poles holding leather seats that spun in front of the soda handles . The long silver bar under the counter was how she would climb to the stool . She could smell ice cream , root beer , witch hazel , and something else . <p> Then she saw her mother and father in the people all bunched there like gray animals standing in a cold field , and they were perfectly quiet and listening to a radio voice . She was frightened by them and wanted to undo what she had done , go back out the door without even seeing , into the wool seats , back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she could do that . But the return , as she looked back through the glass door at the black car , seemed more impossible than her easy badness , much harder than pushing down on the door handle and letting herself out , walking with no one holding her hand and coming in here by herself . Still no one saw her . She began to cry . For the ice cream , for the funnies , for being alone outside the grown-ups who were all so close together and held there by a radio voice . <p> The voice stopped . Lelia 's crying made people look . Music started . Tom went and picked her up and rubbed his face in her tears . Marguerite looked at him holding her and started to cry , too . " ! was praying it would n't happen , " she said . <p> " I knew it would , " said Tom . <p> " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , " sobbed Lelia . " I just wanted my ice cream . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japs bombed Pearl Harbor and now we 're in a war . " <p> " I do n't know what that is , " said Lelia . <p> " It 's when people fight and kill each other . " <p> " Pearl Harbor , I mean . I know about war , " said Lelia . <p> " Then you 're the only one , " said her father , taking them back outside into the gray day . <p> She sat in the backseat and pretended she had never left the car and she would start again , hoping for ice cream and funnies . But they had left her and did n't come back . How could she know now if they would ever have come back , since she had changed things by going after them ? And there was war now , too , and her Daddy then would go , and war was terrible . She had been to bandage foldings for the War Relief with her mother and all those women talking about war and what everybody knew about the time Richmond was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her grandmother , Big Lelia , had china sent by some Yankee boy 's mother to a farther-back grandmother ( Big Lelia 's own ) for nursing this enemy boy who might have died except she treated him like her own sons who did die before Little Lelia was born . Sometimes it was hard to tell if they were talking about china or blood or dead boys . <p> All leaves were canceled . Tom would have to report for duty in the morning , but he thought if they went to the nearest military post , he might find out more details about what had happened in the Pacific . " Do you want to drive up to Fort Story with me ? " he said . <p> " Will there be a parade ? " asked Lelia . <p> " No , Sweetiepie , " said Marguerite . <p> " Do you all want to come ? " Tom asked again . <p> " Hazel wo n't mind , I guess , if Tommy wakes up from his nap , " said Marguerite . " We should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she started to spend them in tears . " Yes , I want to go with you . " <p> Tom drove . He always did when he was with them . There was a feeling of being alone together , like early morning when you are afraid of the day coming . The gray was like something about to happen  --  nothing good . All somehow her fault . Lelia did n't know what to do for the sadness . There were no funny-looking people on the boardwalk for them all to laugh at together . Not one determined walker . No strangers puffed up like sofas in layered sweaters walking their Sunday dinners down . The foreigners had n't really been noticeable when the weather was hot , and they were hidden in crowds of sailors wearing summer whites , laughing with their girlfriends . When cold weather came though , they were almost the only ones out ; you could see them like walking mountains separated by stretches of sea , going first north and then south or first south and then north and back to their houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same language she did . They spoke Russian . Lelia liked to know about them , anything anyone would tell her : " Do you think they 'll put on one more sweater this week ? How many will that be ? Is it colder ? Do they put them on each time it 's colder or each time it 's a new week ? How many sweaters do they have ? Does one of them make all of the sweaters ? .... Who are the Russians ? " was an old question that had war for an answer . War made them live at the beach all year round , not just during summer . There were others left behind in Russia where it was even colder , and these Virginia Russians sent all their winter clothes to them and made do with layers of old things themselves because they did n't think Virginia was cold in the least . Then on New Year 's they were going to jump in the ocean and swim like polar bears . Lelia had been counting and thought they would wear nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> " Will they come back for New Year 's ? You said the crazy Russians swim on New Year 's . Do they swim in their sweaters ? Do they or do n't they ? " <p> " Of course not , " said Tom and Marguerite together as the boardwalk abruptly ended with a rail and an empty bench . Marguerite pulled a piece of knitting out of her workbag the way she always did in the car . Dunes began with houses down in their grasses and peeks of gray sky off and on . <p> Without that long thin thread of horizon to hold things in place , Lelia began to be quiet . <p> " Is that you getting sick ? " asked Marguerite to the silence . <p> " I think so , " said Lelia . <p> " Open your window , Tom , " said Marguerite , rolling hers down . <p> Lelia watched the glass disappear into a fuzzy strip of something like caterpillars . The damp northeast wind blew in on them , invading . <p> Such a Solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember summer . They had really stayed too long at the beach this time . One day , a while back , when it had first turned cold , Marguerite , Lelia , Hazel , and Tommy had been taking a walk and they were all climbing up the dune to their cottage . Tommy had quit walking hours ago and was asleep and drooling on Hazel 's shoulder so he never heard Marguerite say they were staying there for the winter . Lelia and Hazel heard . The dry sand was melting away , ceding underfoot , and already it was too cold to be barefoot and their shoes were full . <p> Lelia looked behind her down the dune at where the beach was half gone and the green waves were rolling closer and closer to their cottage . She had known things were not going their usual way . It was always hot to drive up to Richmond . Now it was cold and they were still waiting for something . <p> Hazel was glum . The dry sand was hard to walk on carrying somebody 's baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to even in the summer , and she had left on Labor Day with the family she worked for . Sometimes a friend from Norfolk would come and take her there to have some fun , but usually she did n't have any . <p> Tommy was n't even two and was the only one who did not know that it was his father , Big Tom , that this was all about . Because Tom Ruffin was not a doctor in Richmond anymore ; he was at the Naval Base in Norfolk , and by staying at Virginia Beach they would be closer and could see him weekends . <p> Summer was over but there was still something empty about the days , like a too-long vacation , a cheater calling time-out , a job you hated . The old rules were broken . Lelia looked up for the sparkle in her mother 's blue eyes to tell her not to worry , but Marguerite 's eyes were closed . She was not looking out of them at Lelia but back at her life in scenes of she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just the things she knew she did when she was doing them . She took responsibility now for not starting Lelia in play school and for keeping them in the cold cottage with just kerosene heaters where they might all catch their death . She knew this might be leading to something worse , but she decided anyhow . <p> Marguerite took a long time with her thoughts , enough time for Lelia to remember something , one of the stories she knew , somebody else 's memory . Like that sand carried away by the ocean to make a new beach somewhere else . Or carried straight through their house by that same crazy ocean in one of the best stories of all : the Hurricane of ' 34 . Brother Hatch , Uncle Hatch , Mr. Hatch in a boat in the living room and the water halfway up the stairs . <p> Such a solid house , that story meant : even the ocean did n't destroy it . <p> " Before you were born , Lelia , " her Uncle Hatch told her again before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a kit . It was canvas , you know , a skin glued on a wood frame . And there was a big , big storm , and the water began to rise . " She leaned into the mixed smells of his summer skin . " I 'd brought my kayak inside because it was just finished , and I was worried about the glue setting in the rain . It was pouring . Pouring buckets . When I saw how high it was getting ! said I 'd evacuate everybody , but no one wanted to go with me . They just made canned soup on the sterno . It never gets real bad , they said . And then the ocean came right around the dunes and in the front door and started up the stairs . You can see the marks Where it 's white there on the wood . Then they said , Well , but your boat 's too small ; so we all had to move upstairs but not into the attic because the chimney blew down , and what if the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big waves . This is just the wash . Say your prayers and go to sleep . Only the Good Lord can do anything about this now . ! did n't want to go to sleep . With all the crashing of waves out behind the dunes and the big wind roaring , I could n't . I wanted to look out the windows , but most of them were shuttered , and it was too black to see out of the others anyhow . Your grandmother said , Lie down . Stop walking around . You 're making me nervous . And your mother laughed and said , Hatch can make you nervous , Mother ? When we 're all going to drown and wake up dead ? But nobody believed that would happen , really . We just wrapped up in our blankets and waited and waited . Then the eye came through . " Lelia liked the part about the eye . She did n't exactly understand what it could be . " The wind stops and you think it 's silence because there 's been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stopped . You know it 's swirling in your house , but that 's something you ca n't hear-just the pounding outside . You 're at the heart . The eye . The hurricane goes around and round , and after a while , it seemed like forever , but maybe it was n't so long , the wind comes back just as loud but from the other direction . Lelia , do you see ? " He was drawing a big snail , Lelia thought , in the sand left from where he had put his feet on the table . " Here , like this , " he said . " You 're here . And the wind  --  this is the wind-comes from here . Then you 're in the middle , where it all feels empty , and the wind  --  this is still the wind  --  comes from here when the eye goes by . Lelia , do you see ? " <p> " What about the boat ? When do you get in the boat ? " <p> " The next morning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright when we wake up , not dead at all . " <p> Beauty There must have been a Thanksgiving and a Christmas that year but , without all the uncles and aunts and great uncles and great aunts and all the tag-along friends and neighbors up in Richmond to turn it into a grand occasion , at Virginia Beach those days got lost in all the others . <p> He must have left . He must have said good-bye to somebody . He must have said good-bye to her because she was his sweet baby girl . But Lelia never could remember the day Tom left . Next she knew she had a sore throat and a fever , still in the cold beach cottage , and Tommy was crying as if he were getting an earache , but he would n't say if he had one or not . The windows were hard to see through because they had n't been washed since warm weather . The crib was against the inner wall , and the white iron bed was against the other , so Lelia had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off walking on the beach to watch the Russians do their New Year 's swim , and she promised to tell whether they had taken any of their clothes off . Hazel was downstairs with the radio loud . Tommy was sleeping in his crib with his behind in the air and snuffling on his thumb , so Lelia thought she might wake him up to play since she was n't very sick . He was always sleeping as far as she could see . She crawled to the end of her bed by the window so she could climb out into the crib , but she stopped to look at the ocean and saw a beautiful bird . He was paddling at the water with his wide white wings . He was trying to get out of the waves ' way , but they kept coming at him . He fell down and the water turned him over . " Hazel ! " she screamed . " Hazel , Hazel , Hazel , come here quick ! " Hazel came there quick , thinking it was for Tommy , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to call . " Not for Tommy , not for Tommy . Look at this bird . You 've got to get ' this bird . He 's going to die . " <p> " How I goin ' to get you any kind of bird ? What you want with some dumb bird ? " <p> " Just get it , Hazel , and get it quick . It 's washing out to seal " <p> " You tell me how I 'm goin ' to get it . " <p> " You 're going to take the trash can . And you 're going to put it on top . And you 're going to swoop him up in it . Fast . You can . " <p> Lelia saw the bird sit down to rest as the wave drew back into the ocean . " Now , " she said to Hazel . " He 's so tired . " The water rolled him over again and Hazel , willing enough to trade a yowling two-year-old for the promise of some peaceful ironing , grabbed the trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't shut up . <p> " Hush up , Tommy , " she said . " Look , we 're going to have a bird for a brother . It can swim and fly and do things you ca n't do . " She hauled him out of his crib by standing on the end of her bed , and they pushed their faces against the window to see Hazel run out of the cottage , her green uniform the only spot of color on the beach . Right down to the water 's edge she went , and then she stepped back so the wave would n't get her feet , and then she ran forward and put the trash can over the bird , and then she ran back so the wave would n't get her , and then she ran forward and tried to make the bird get in , and a wave came so she ran away , and the trash can and the bird were caught in the water . " Oh swoop it , dummy ! " screamed Lelia . But Hazel did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house as fast as she could with the heavy , wet trash can held at arm 's length , puffs of sand lifting behind her feet , and her green skirt tangling between her legs in the hard wind . <p> " Oh yea ! Yea ! " the children called . Hazel could n't hear them , but she grinned up at their window and trudged up the dune and into the house , slamming both doors . <p> " Do n't you get out that bed , now , " she hollered up at the sound of their feet running toward the stairs . " Me and Mr. Bird , we comin ' up . " <p> They joined her at the top and tried to look in the can . <p> " Whuh ! Whee-ooo ! I never did hear of nobody stay at no beach in this kind of weather ! " She led them back to their bedroom with the trash can . <p> " Hope you pleased , now , Miss Lelia . There you be , bird , " said Hazel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lelia looked down at him . He did n't look so beautiful , just huge . His wings were n't flat down like birds on trees : one stuck up against the side of the can ; the other looked loose . <p> " You kicked him too hard , " she said to Hazel . <p> " That 's a plenty from you , " said Hazel . " He 's sick . Freeze my gazibbet to gets you a bird . You better not be complainin ' . " <p> " What let 's name him ? " Lelia asked . <p> " He mighty sick . Call him ' Sicky . ' " <p> " ' Beauty . ' I 'm calling him ' Beauty . ' Hi , Beauty . Ca n't you say anything ? " The bird blinked its black eye . Lelia put her arms in to lift it into bed with her , but the gull pecked as if it were not at all sick . " Owl Owl Hazel , he 's hungry . What are we going to feed him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to feed him , honey , but I 'm goin ' to have me some hot coffee . You and your baby brother just set here and talk to your bird while you figure out what he hungry for . Wrap up . It cold in here , too . Now you mind your brother good for me , Miss Lelia . I done you a favor . " <p> Lelia said yes , and Hazel went away . They dumped the bird out . At first he was even bigger . He walked around . He walked pretty well for being sick , Lelia told Tommy , but she wished he could fly . They walked around behind him for a long while trying to shoo him up into the air , but he would n't even try . " I 'll set him up on the bed , and then he 'll have to fly to get down , " Lelia said , but Beauty tried to bite ; so they just ran around behind him . <p> So Marguerite found Hazel drinking coffee alone in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing on the radio , the hot iron next to a pile of sprinkled laundry , but nothing pressed and no Tommy . " You should have gotten him up , Hazel . He 'll never go to bed tonight . " <p> " Yes 'm , " said Hazel . " He not asleep but they 's both upstairs . " <p> " Hazel ! You know the kind of mischief he makes ! Lelia 's too sick to look after him . " <p> " You find out what them Russian people wears for swimmin ' ? " <p> " Bathing suits and bathing caps . Like everybody else in the world . " <p> " Ai n't nobody else in the world go swimmin ' New Year 's . " <p> " Hazel , you do n't know how annoyed I am with you . You 're supposed to be minding the children , not worrying about Russians . Listen ... " She stopped as if hearing something and heard another squeal of laughter . " Just listen to them ! They 're not supposed to get excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radio . " They good children . They ai n't hurt . They laughin ' . " Marguerite frowned and hurried upstairs with Hazel close behind to explain the rest . <p> " No ! " said Marguerite at the door . <p> Lelia was found in her bed with her legs under the covers but her curls more ' messy than sitting usually made them . Tommy was following the limping gull around and trying to pick it up . <p> Marguerite stared . She stared at Tommy , who ran and grabbed his mother 's legs so she would pick him up ; but she was too mad . Then she stared at Lelia , who wondered if mothers always knew if you got out of bed . She even seemed to be staring out of the back of her head at Hazel , who was still standing behind her . " We 're going to go home to Richmond , " said Marguerite . " I ca n't do this all alone . " <p> " I help you pack , Miss Marguerite . " Hazel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perk up . <p> " We have to take Beauty , " cried Lelia , flinging herself on the gull who had sat down and gone to sleep in the staring lull . He did n't bite this time . " Look , " said Lelia . " He 's nice . " <p> " He 's sick and he 's filthy . You 're going to catch something . Parrot fever . You 're supposed to be sick in bed anyhow . When you 're well , we 're going . The bird can spend the night in the trash can , and we 'll put him out in the sun tomorrow . " <p> Lelia did n't say anything more . If Beauty stayed one night , he might stay another . <p> Pitch-black dark . Whose victory that the gull flutters and dies in a metal trash basket while everyone sleeps ? Black eye closes with the lights and opens suddenly with surprise to be no sun , no light , death . Stars ever scanter absorbed into the downy sky , gray then rose . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
