<p> Back in 1993 when Hunters Point community activist Herm Lewis released his first rap compilation , " Trying to Survive in the Ghetto , " he had no idea it would go on to become a commercial success and pioneer a movement . <p> Today these Bay Area rap-artist collections are being released at the frenzied rate of about one every other week . And with a dozen compilations slated for release before summer 's end , the prolific movement is showing no signs of slowing down . <p> It has also inspired rappers elsewhere in the nation , with the recent " Gulf Coast Compilation " out of the South and " Big Boy Compilation " from Tennessee joining the pack . But their numbers do n't compare to what 's happening in the Bay Area . <p> Ironically , Lewis , who provided the blueprint for the hugely profitable genre , has to find a new game . <p> " Four years ago I sold 70,000 units , which was amazing , but now I 'd be lucky to sell 20,000 or even 15,000 copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said from Premiere Studios in Hunters Point . <p> And Lewis is n't the only one who 's feeling the heat of the competition . <p> " The marketplace is definitely oversaturated right now , and I think that we 're going to see some big changes by the end of ' 97 , " said Jo Treggiari of the Oakland rap label DogDay Records , which in the coming weeks will release the 36-track , double-CD Bay Area compilation " Million Dollar Dream . " <p> " Dream " will hit the market around the same time as E40 and B-Legit 's mega double- album " South West Riders , " Ant Banks ' " Big Thangs , " JT the Bigga Figga 's " Frisco City Allstars , " " Who Put Sac on the Map ? , " " International Blunt Funk , " " Isolated in the Game , " Khayree 's " Blackalation " and the ever-present former Bay Area resident Master P ( see story on Page 33 ) , who dominates most of the nation 's rap charts with such releases as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Bad Boyz Vol II " collections . <p> FOLLOWING THE MONEY TRAIL <p> In fact , Master P was the first person to wisely follow Lewis ' money trail with the release of 1993 's hot-selling compilation " West Coast Bad Boyz . " " Boss Ballin , " compiled by the Click 's D-Shot , followed soon after , selling a phenomenal 180,000 units to date . <p> Up until that point , there had been only a handful of Bay Area offerings , including the 1988 Dangerous Crew compilation from Too $ hort , which , did n't sell well despite boasting early tracks from Rappin ' 4 Tay and Spice-1 . <p> All of that changed with the success of Lewis , D-Shot and Master P. Then , when " Bay Area Playaz " was released in 1995 featuring highly visible , highly paid artists , it was obvious to all that compilations meant big money . It also meant the stakes were raised . <p> " I heard that they spent $ 100,000 on producing ' Bay Area Playaz , ' " Lewis said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today it would probably cost 10 times that . " <p> Part of the high cost comes from having to pay big-name artists ; E40 , C-BO , Luniz , B- Legit and Dru Down charge up to $ 10,000 for one song on a compilation . But big names have become necessary to sell records . <p> " These days I would n't recommend putting out a compilation with unrecognizable names , " D-Shot said . <p> LEARNING THE HARD WAY <p> Lewis learned that the hard way when his second compilation , " Still Trying to Survive in the Ghetto , " sold way below expectations in 1995 . <p> But while big names guarantee big sales , they do n't necessarily guarantee market longevity , as demonstrated a few months back with the Bay Area star-heavy " Notorious Pimps , Playa 's &; Hustlas , " which sold heavily in its first month but then quickly fell off as newer titles flooded the market . <p> " Rap fans always want to have the very latest thing . That 's what they run out to buy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " International Blunt Funk . " " Most solo recordings are n't that tight anyway , so rap fans are n't about to risk their $ 15 on only one or two good songs . " <p> Charles Baldwin , project coordinator of last year 's " Cell Block Compilation , " which sold an impressive 100,000 copies , agrees . <p> " I refuse to do a one-artist rap album . Compilations guarantee both diversity and quality , " he said . " With a one-artist album your ears get tired . It 's like enduring an hour of conversation from that one person . That 's why even the majority of the Bay Area solo releases are essentially compilations , since they always feature a ton of guest rappers . " <p> Ant Banks , whose recently released West Coast star-studded " Big Thangs " is selling briskly , believes that the compilation trend will continue , but " it 's getting a bit tired because it 's a case of monkey see , monkey do . People need to be original and come up with new themes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap compilation . In the coming months , both KMEL DJ Chuy Gomez and the rap magazine 4080 are planning such retro releases . <p> Another theme  --  one that is considered by many in the industry to be a gimmick  --  is double-CD sets . And in the fall , Vallejo producer Coolio Da Unda Dog ( who worked on much of Mac Dre 's " Rompilation " ) will release a triple-CD Bay Area compilation . <p> DogDay 's Treggiari sees the current marketplace saturation as representative of what 's happening in the rap industry overall . <p> " Rap has just become a way to make a quick buck . There is so much crap out there these days , " she said , likening the proliferation of labels and releases to disco in the late ' 70s . " I foresee a big upheaval in the music biz within the next year . The majors are turning away from rap , and the indie guys who are in it only for the money are quickly realizing that it 's not so lucrative after all . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Area 's close-knit rap community has become a role model for the rest of the country . Said Daraka Shaheed of Vallejo 's Young Black Brotha Records : " Everything about the Bay Area , including how it fully supports its own artists , offers an inspiration to areas like the South and the Midwest . " <p> THE UNSTOPABLE MASTER P <p> Entrepreneur is a rap role model <p> Former East Bay resident Percy Miller , a.k.a. rapper-entrepreneur Master P , is the envy of the rap industry . His phenomenally successful label , No Limit Records , currently holds seven spaces on Billboard 's R &B; album chart . <p> These include the Louisiana-born artist 's recently released compilation " I 'm Bout It , " which came in at No. 1 and has already sold 1 million copies . The companion straight-to-video feature film , which he wrote , directed and starred in , sold an unprecedented 300,000 copies in its first month . <p> With all this success , the self-made Master P has become a rap industry role model . DogDay Records ' Jo Treggiari most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and against odds . " When radio would n't play his music , he went straight to the streets and marketed it himself . And when he could n't get his movie into theaters , he went straight to video , " she said . <p> Treggiari met Master P in the Bay Area eight years ago , shortly after he had moved from New Orleans to Richmond . With an inheritance from his grandfather , he had just opened a little record store called No Limit . <p> Within a year , Master P was releasing albums under his own label , including his own recordings and CDs by his group the Real Untouchables , as well as work by several other artists . <p> After the 1993 success of " West Coast Bad Boyz , " Master P moved back to Louisiana , where he released 1995 's double-CD " Down South Hustlers , " a collection by Southern rappers that firmly established his label and kick-started a Southern rap scene . Many current rap magazines feature glossy two-page spreads advertising No Limit 's 18-album roster for 1997 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We Ca n't Be Stopped .
