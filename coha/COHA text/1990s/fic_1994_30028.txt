The English Channel 1802 " Aye , there 's some that says he 's the ghost o ' Captain Kidd come back from the dead to revenge hisself on those who betrayed him . " Lucy Snow peeked over the top of her book , finding the lure of such torrid gossip more irresistible than the modestly titled , self-published memoirs of Lord Howell : Nautical Genius of the Century her father had provided for her journey . The creeping shadows of twilight had made reading nearly impossible anyway . Unaware of her scrutiny , the sailor leaned against a barrel , his ancient bones creaking in harmony with the deck of the HMS Tiberius . His audience consisted of a handful of sailors and a starry-eyed cabin boy . " None 's ever seen him and lived to tell of it . Some say only a glance from his evil eye 'll skewer you to the deck like a bolt o ' lightning . Aye , bold and ruthless is Captain Doom . " Lucy sniffed back a derisive snort . Captain Doom indeed . This mythical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dreadful Gothic novels Lord Howell 's flighty daughter Sylvie insisted on reading . One young sailor was of like mind . Lucy wrinkled her nose as he spat a wad of tobacco on the freshly scrubbed deck of the modest frigate . " Balderdash ! I heard the stories , too , but I says it 's nothin ' but rum talkin ' . There ai n't been true pirates in these waters foro'er seventy-five years . " He tilted his hat to a cocky angle , underscoring the brashness of his youth . " We ai n't livin ' in lawless times like Captain Kidd . This bloke 'd be more likely to get his timbers shivered by the Channel Fleet than not . " Knowing her father would not have approved either her eavesdropping or interrupting what was meant to be a private conversation , Lucy bit back an agreement . The war with France had lapsed into tentative truce with the Peace of Amiens , but the quieter the winds blew from Napoleon 's burgeoning empire , the more nervous the Royal Navy became . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put himself in their eager cannon sights . " Not if he truly is a ghost , " the cabin boy whispered , startling Lucy with his precise reply to her musings . " Then he 'd have nothin ' to lose . Nothin ' at all . " Lucy shivered in spite of herself and huddled deeper into her shawl . Now , Lucinda , the Admiral admonished from perfect memory , seafaring men are a superstitious lot , but you 're not a girl given to fancy . For once , his chiding voice brought comfort instead of humiliation . A sailor in a worn peacoat drew a whalebone pipe from his pocket . As he struck a match and touched it to the capped bowl , the flame cast wavering shadows over a face leathered by sun and salt spray . " I seen him , " he announced curtly , earning all of their attentions , including Lucy 's . " I was on lookout in the foretop on an eve much like this one . There were n't nothin ' but sea and sky for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sailed like a demon ship cast from the bowels o ' hell . " Lucy suspected her own eyes were now as round as the cabin boy 's . " I could n't speak . I could n't move . ' T was as if the very sight o ' her froze me blood . Before I could pry me mouth open to shout a warning , the sea swallowed her without so much as a billow . I never seen nothin ' like it in all me born days . " He shuddered . " Never hope to again . " A pall of silence enveloped the men , broken only by the eerie creaking of the spars and the lazy flapping of the sails against the wind . Full duck had fallen as they spoke . Tendrils of mist came creeping out of the darkening sea like the tentacles of some mythical beast . Lucy saw one of the sailors glance over his shoulder and sign an unobtrusive cross on his breast . As if to banish the spell of foreboding , the men all began chattering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his victims just like the devil he is . " " Wo n't tolerate babblin ' , they says . The lass would n't stop screamin ' , so he up and sewed her lips together with sail twine . " " Cleaved the poor bloke in two , he did , with one mighty stroke of his cutlass . " The young sailor who had earlier dared to express scorn for the spectral captain wiggled his eyebrows in a mocking leer . " I 'll wager that ai n't nothin ' compared to the cleavin ' he does on his lady captives . One o ' my mates swears this Captain Doom ravished ten virgins in one night . " " Ha ! " scoffed a grizzled tar . " I done as much after seven months at sea and nary a glimpse o ' stocking . " The young sailor elbowed him in the ribs . " Aye , but them were n't hardly virgins , was they ? " The men roared with laughter . Lucy reluctantly decided she 'd best make her presence known before she learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foibles of sailors . She extracted herself from her seat of coiled ropes and stepped into full view . The men snapped to flustered attention as if Admiral Sir Lucien Snow himself had marched onto the deck of the ship . Lucy was not impressed . She 'd been receiving such welcomes since she 'd been old enough to toddle up the gangplank of a ship . Her father 's reputation as one of the most revered admirals in His Majesty 's Royal Navy had preceded her every step . She favored them with a benevolent smile . " Good evening , gentlemen . I do hope I have n't interrupted your charming discourse on the merits of piracy . " She nodded toward the young sailor , whose tanned skin had flushed a becoming peach . " Do go on , sir . I believe you were about to treat us to more of your speculations on Captain Doom 's romantic exploits . " One of his mates cleared his throat meaningfully and the sailor snatched off his hat , crumpling it into a ball . " M-M-Miss Snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . ' T was hardly fit talk for a lady 's ears . " " Then I suppose we 'll have to string you up from the yardarm , wo n't we ? " The lad 's Adam 's apple bobbed with obvious distress and Lucy sighed . For some reason , no one could ever tell when she was joking . She knew that most of her acquaintances suspected she 'd been born with no sense of humor at all . She was , however , blessed with a finely honed sense of the absurd . The weathered sailor in the peacoat shoved his way forward as if fearing she might actually weave a noose of her delicate shawl . " Allow me to escort you to your cabin , Miss Snow , ' Tis n't safe for a young lady of quality to be roamin ' ' bout the deck after dark . " He gallantly offered her his arm , but the patronizing note in his voice struck the wrong chord with Lucy . " No , thank you , " she said coolly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tilting her nose to a regal angle , she sailed past them , ignoring the discordant murmur that rose behind her . Some perverse seed of rebellion drove her away from the narrow companionway leading to her cabin and toward the deserted stern . She studied Lord Howell 's memoirs for a moment , then tossed them over the aft rail into the churning froth of the ship 's wake . The leather-bound book sank without a trace . " Sorry , Sylvie , " she whispered to her absent friend . Since Lord Howell was an old friend of her father 's , she suspected the Admiral had only recommended the book because of its flattering , if somewhat exaggerated , accounts of his own cunning exploits during the Americans ' ill-mannered rebellion against England . She wondered how her father was faring on his overland voyage . Since his untimely leg wound had forced him to retire from His Majesty 's service six years ago , the Admiral had never missed a chance for a sea voyage , even one as tame as the journey form their summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank of the Thames . She drew her shawl close around her . True to its fickle nature , London society had spurned all things French except for their fashions . The brisk wind blowing off the North Atlantic Sea whipped up Lucy 's skirt and bit through her thin petticoat . But she could bear that discomfort better than being trapped in the stifling confines of her cabin , her fate decided by the whims of others . If she stayed on deck long enough , perhaps the Captain 's half-deaf mother would retire for the evening and Lucy would be spared bellowing at her over the galley dining table . Lucy usually found a ship by night soothing to her senses , but the peace she sought drifted just out of her reach , her solitude tainted by restlessness . Even the low-pitched music of male voices working in perfect accord seemed muted and distant . She frowned , licking away the sea salt that flecked her lips . In the rising mist , sound should carry with the clarity of a ringing bell , but the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its breath with her . She strained her eyes , seeing nothing but fog swirling up from the inky darkness and the rising moon flirting with tattered patches of clouds . Chill ribbons of mist coaxed their way through the gauzy muslin of her gown , dampening her bare skin with their greedy touch . The sailors ' tales of Captain Doom haunted her . On such a night it took little imagination to envision a phantom ship stalking the seas in search of prey . Lucy could almost hear the chant of its betrayed sailors vowing vengeance , the hollow bong of a bell that would seal their doom . She shook off a delicious shiver . She could only imagine what the Admiral would say if he caught her indulging in such whimsy . She was turning away from the rail to seek the more mundane comforts of her cabin when the veil of darkness parted and the ghost ship glided into view . Lucy 's heart slammed into her rib cage , then seemed to stop beating altogether . She clutched the rail , her shawl falling unheeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds as the sleek black bow of the phantom schooner crested the waves , its towering spars enshrouded by mist , its rigging glistening like the web of a deadly spider . Ebony sails billowed in the wind , whispering instead of flapping . The vessel sailed in eerie silence with no lanterns , no sign of life , no hint of mercy . Lucy stood transfixed , mesmerized by a primitive thrill of fear . Although the wind whipped her hair across her face and fed the hungry sails of the phantom ship , she seemed to be standing in a vortex of airlessness . She could n't think . Could n't breathe . Could n't scream . It was then that she saw the ship 's Jolly Roger rippling from the highest spara man 's hand , ivory against a sable background , squeezing scarlet drops of blood from a captive heart . Her fist flew to her breast as she battled the absurd notion that it was her heart , no longer beating of its own will , but thundering in accord with the dark command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one to see the ship , then surely its grim message was meant for her . The phantom ship came about with lethal grace . Remembering the sailor 's story , Lucy pressed her eyes shut , knowing the ship would be gone when she opened them . A poignant sense of loss tightened her throat . There was no place in neatly ordered life for such dark fantasy , yet the ship 's unearthly beauty had touched some secret corner of her soul . Cannonfire blazed against the night sky . Lucy 's eyes flew open in shock as the ghost ship fired very earthly warning shot over their bow in the universal demand for surrender .
