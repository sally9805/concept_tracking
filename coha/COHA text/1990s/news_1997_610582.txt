<p> I can not pinpoint the moment of my transformation from ordinary cookbook owner to devoted disciple . But it happened soon after a friend told me about a cookbook called " Lulu 's Provencal Table . " That $ 23 book , a few years old and now sadly out of print , turned out to be just the beginning . Soon I was so caught up in Lulu Peyraud 's rustic French recipes that I decided I had to go to Provence and meet my newfound idol . <p> I am not usually a celebrity-chasing , autograph-seeking fan . But the book , written by Lulu 's American neighbor , the renowned food writer Richard Olney , enchanted me because it is so much more than a compilation of recipes . Sprinkled with Madame Peyraud 's photographs , it is part guidebook , part testimonial to the Provencal way of eating and life that can replenish the soul . <p> I was taken by Madame Peyraud 's tendency to describe recipes intuitively and by her overall lack of pretension in the kitchen . Together with Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lulu dinners , " meals often preceded by serious discussions . <p> The centerpiece of Madame Peyraud 's gastronomic life is bouillabaisse , the fabled fish soup from Marseille , once considered simple sustenance for poor fishermen . Now it is Madame Peyraud 's signature dish and , having entertained countless guests with it in the last 50 years , she is known across the seas for her rendition . Even Alice Waters , the chef and owner of Chez Panisse in California , has made the pilgrimage to Madame Peyraud 's large , stately house in the middle of Domaine Tempier , the vineyard her family has owned for generations . <p> " A bouillabaisse day at the Domaine Tempier is a finely orchestrated celebration , " Olney writes in a 10-page chapter devoted to the subject . " Behind the scenes , the day begins with Lulu 's visit to Bandol to meet the fishing boats . " <p> Long before we bought our tickets to France , Jason and I tried to have our own finely orchestrated celebration , beginning with a 2 a.m. shopping excursion through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a success , although I did have trouble with the rouille , a saffron-garlic mayonnaise served alongside , which failed to emulsify . <p> We decided we wanted the real thing  --  Madame Peyraud 's own . So we pasted together a storyboard of our bouillabaisse , even asking for an audience with our mentor and enclosed a self-addressed postcard with boxes where she could check " oui " or " non . " <p> The postcard came back to us quickly . Good news : Madame Peyraud had checked off the box marked " oui " and suggested a dejeuner at our convenience . <p> Exiting the highway from Toulon to Marseille , we could spot the wide-spreading maritime pines tucked among the hills , proudly announcing the domaine 's presence . We parked near the cherry trees at the end of a long narrow drive and walked toward the ancient house and vineyard where Madame Peyraud , her husband , Lucien , and their son Jean-Marie , make the Bandol wines that have been called one of Provence 's " most privileged " appellations . <p> Frederique Naudin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy wooden front door and led us inside , past a salon and sitting room and on toward the tiny kitchen in back . At its threshold stood a petite woman wearing a light blue frock , gold lame slippers , round white earrings and a smile as warm as her country French kitchen . <p> " Bonjour , Sarah , " Lulu said , her arm on mine . " Le grand jour est arrive ! " Indeed , the great day had arrived . <p> Lulu 's kitchen is like an ancient and intimate sanctuary . An open brick fireplace for cooking runs the length of one wall . On the mantel and in cubbyholes below are the rustic tools that form the basis of her technique . There are mortars and pestles , metal racks for grilling fish and meat , long-handled forks and spatulas , all as chipped and charred from use as I had imagined . <p> In the center of the room is her altar , a long wooden table on which lay the ingredients for our dejeuner : a plate of crushed and whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quartered potatoes , a bouquet of fennel , a bowl of mussels and , finally , a dried-cork platter draped with a towel . With an easy flourish , Lulu unveiled an artful array of whole and filleted fish  --  John Dory , rascasses , monkfish , octopus , conger eel . Resting on top , a slotted spoon cradled a monkfish liver . The display could mean only one thing : bouillabaisse . <p> Sure enough , outside in the open patio , the huge copper cauldron stood on a metal tripod above a bed of twigs . Richard Olney , who was also invited to the lunch , lit the fire . Lulu , 79 , filled the vessel with a fragrant seafood broth she had prepared the day before . <p> Then she turned to the all-important rouille . Using her most sacred utensil , the marble mortar and wooden pestle , she mashed garlic , salt and cayenne pepper to a fine paste . Then she added the precious monkfish liver , which she had gently poached minutes before and without which Lulu says there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg yolks , a saffron-bread mixture and olive oil  --  turning the pestle until the emulsion thickened . <p> I was marveling at the assured and seemingly effortless way Lulu carried out this process , which had caused me such consternation months before , when suddenly she paused . <p> " Il est trompe , " she whispered , beckoning Olney to her side . A flurry of French ensued . Olney assumed control of the mortar and pestle but to no avail , as he declared the fallen rouille beyond repair . Lulu remained unflustered . She merely scraped the concoction into a mini-Cuisinart , turned it on and drizzled in olive oil . Like magic , the delicate emulsion was resurrected . <p> Lulu returned to the patio to nurse the bouillabaisse broth and add the seafood at appropriate intervals . She encouraged us to take photographs , and we did , although I had the disconcerting sense that I was trying to capture a mirage . ( In a self-fulfilling prophecy , I later dropped and broke my camera . ) <p> The brew percolated for several more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platter . While she decanted the steaming broth into two large serving dishes , Olney announced : " A table ! " And " to the table " we went . <p> The next few hours passed in a rapturous blur . Lulu stood beside a rolling cart and ceremoniously distributed the delicacies of the sea on each guest 's plate . The broth was served in separate bowls . The rouille ( now returned to the grand marble mortar ) was passed around to be slathered on toasted rounds of baguette and set afloat in the bowls of soup . Lulu 's bouillabaisse , which had turned a luscious sunset red , was simple paradise . From my first bite of tender octopus to the last sip of broth ( I had three bowls of it ) , the flavors grew ever richer , ever subtler . <p> The cheese course that followed included a couple of fresh rounds of chevre , just the right touch as we finished off the remaining 1992 Domaine Tempier red . For dessert , we ate cantaloupe grown on the premises , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hampshire after racking my brain for something to take to the chef who appeared to have it all . Lulu honored me by ladling syrup into the well of her melon . She said that her husband , who was ailing , would covet it as well . <p> We retired to the salon for coffee and a shot of marc , a fiery brandy that is distilled from the grape pressings after making wine . The room grew dark and quiet during a sudden rainstorm , and , at Lulu 's urging , I closed my eyes and fell asleep . <p> When I awoke , Lulu had gone upstairs to look after Lucien , and Frederique had started in on the dishes . If there can be a more blissful way to pass five hours , I can not imagine it . With a sigh , we said our goodbyes . It was time to go home . <p> BOUILLABAISSE <p> ( 8 servings ) <p> Here is the fabled recipe , adapted from " Lulu 's Provencal Table " by Richard Olney ( HarperCollins , 1994 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix well in a bouillabaisse .

Monkfish liver , which is essential to the rouille , may have to be ordered from the fishmonger in advance . <p> 2 pounds monkfish , filleted , trimmed of flabby membranes and belly flaps and cut into 8 sections <p> 4 pounds white-fleshed saltwater fish fillets ( see recipe introduction ) , cut into serving portions <p> FOR THE MARINADE : <p> 1 bouquet ( bunch ) fresh wild fennel or several sections fennel stalk or a large pinch of powdered ( ground ) fennel seeds <p> About 1/8 teaspoon powdered ( ground ) saffron <p> 4 to 5 garlic cloves , crushed and peeled <p> About 4 tablespoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoons olive oil <p> 1 large onion , sliced or coarsely chopped <p> 1 head garlic , cloves separated and crushed with heel of hand or beneath a large knife blade <p> 2 tomatoes , quartered <p> 2 to 3 pounds reserved fish heads and carcasses ( gills removed ) , rinsed and chopped or broken into small pieces <p> 1 thick slice conger eel ( about 1/2 pound ) , if available , cut into small pieces <p> 8 small , lively blue crabs <p> Salt and pepper to taste <p> 1 bouquet ( bunch ) fennel , or 1 teaspoon fennel seeds <p> 1 leek , trimmed of tough green parts , partially slit , rinsed and finely sliced <p> 1 celery stalk , sliced <p> 2 carrots , peeled and finely sliced <p> FOR THE ROUILLE : <p> 1 cup fresh bread crumbs , without crusts <p> 1/4 teaspoon powdered ( ground ) saffron dissolved in 2 or 3 tablespoons hot fish soup <p> 2 dried cayenne chili peppers , or a large pinch powdered ( ground ) cayenne <p> Large pinch coarse salt <p> 3 garlic cloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , poached for 1 minute in a ladle of fish soup , until firmed up but still pink <p> 1 egg yolk <p> About 2 cups olive oil , at room temperature <p> TO FINISH THE FISH SOUP : <p> 1/4 teaspoon saffron <p> About 2 pounds potatoes , peeled and quartered <p> 1 large sweet white onion , sliced paper-thin <p> 2 tomatoes , peeled , seeded and coarsely chopped <p> 4 to 5 garlic cloves , crushed and peeled <p> 1 bouquet ( bunch ) fennel ( use the fennel from the marinade ) , or a large pinch fennel seeds tied in a piece of cheesecloth <p> 1 1/2 pounds mussels , soaked in water with a handful of coarse sea salt , scraped , bearded and rinsed <p> 24 thin slices of crusty baguette , preferably sourdough , partially dried out in a slow oven or in the sun , stroked on each side with peeled garlic cloves <p> For the fish marinade : Spread the pieces of fish out on a platter , distribute the fennel branches among them , sprinkle with saffron , add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rub the surfaces of the fish gently until evenly yellowed with saffron and coated with oil . Marinate for a couple of hours , turning the fish over two or three times , while preparing the fish soup and the rouille . <p> Begin the fish soup : In a large heavy pot , warm the olive oil over medium-low heat , add the onion and the crushed , unpeeled garlic cloves and stir regularly until the onion is softened but not colored . Add the tomatoes , the broken-up fish heads and carcasses and the cut-up conger eel , raise the heat to medium and stir regularly , mashing with a wooden spoon or pestle until the contents of the pot are reduced to a coarse debris . Add the live crabs and stir until they turn red . Add about 3 cups water , or enough to cover the contents generously , stir to loosen any debris stuck to the pot , bring to a boil over medium-high heat and skim the foam from the surface . Add salt , pepper , fennel , leek , celery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the lid ajar , for 45 minutes . After 5 or 10 minutes , remove the crabs one or two at a time , to a marble mortar . Pound them with a wooden spoon or pestle , breaking up the shells thoroughly , and spoon them back into the soup . Rinse out the mortar with a ladle of soup and pour it back into the pot . <p> Remove the bouquet of fennel and reserve . Then strain the contents of the pot , 1 cup at a time , through a fine sieve , pressing with the wooden pestle to extract all the liquid . Discard the debris and rinse the sieve as necessary . Strain the liquid two more times , shaking the sieve gently the final time to separate the broth from any pureed solids or fish bones that may have passed through the first two times . Set broth aside . <p> For the rouille : In a bowl , mash the bread crumbs and the dissolved saffron with a fork , adding a bit more fish soup , if necessary , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cayenne peppers to a powder with a wooden pestle . Add , one at a time , the coarse salt and the garlic , the monkfish liver , the egg yolk and the saffron-bread paste , turning the pestle briskly after each addition until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous . Turning the pestle constantly , pour the oil in a thin trickle down the side of the mortar , mounting the mixture like a mayonnaise . Set aside . <p> To finish : Reheat the fish soup , dissolve the saffron in a ladle of boiling soup and stir it in . Add the potatoes , onion , tomatoes , garlic and reserved fennel and return to a boil . Five minutes later , add the mussels , then the marinated pieces of monkfish .
