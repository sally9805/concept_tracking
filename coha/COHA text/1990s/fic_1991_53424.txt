RIGHT AFTER W.W.II everybody in southern Louisiana thought he was going to get rich in the oil business . My father convinced himself that all his marginal jobs in the oil fields would one day give him the capital to become an independent wildcarter , perhaps even a legendary figure like Houston 's Glenn McCarthy , and he would successfully hammer together a drilling operation out of wooden towers and rusted junk , punch through the top of a geological dome , and blow salt water , sand , chains , pipe casing , and oil into the next parish . <p> So he worked on as a roughneck on drilling rigs and as a jug-hustler with a seismograph outfit , then began contracting to build board roads in the marsh for the Texaco Company . By mid-1946 he was actually leasing land in the Atchafalaya Basin and over in east Texas . But that was also the year that I developed rheumatic fever and he drove my mother off and brought Mattie home to live with us . <p> I remember the terrible fight they had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her waitress job in a beer garden on that burning July afternoon , and without changing out of her pink dress with the white piping on the collar and pockets , she had begun butchering chickens on the stump in the backyard and shucking off their feathers in a big iron caldron of scalding water . My father came home later than he should have , parked his pickup truck by the barn , and walked naked to the waist through the gate with his wadded-up shirt hanging out the back pocket of his Levis . He was a dark Cajun , and his shoulders , chest , and back were streaked with black hair . He wore cowboy boots , a red sweathandkerchief tied around his neck , and a rakish straw hat that had an imitation snakeskin band around the crown . <p> Headless chickens were flopping all over the grass , and my mother 's forearms were covered with wet chicken feathers . <p> " I know you been with her . They were talking at the beer joint , " she said , without looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood chair in front of the steaming caldron . <p> " I ai n't been with nobody , " he said , " except with them mosquitoes I been slapping out in that marsh . " <p> " You said you 'd leave her alone . " <p> " You children go inside , " my father said . <p> " That gon na make your conscience right cause you send them kids off , you ? She gon na cut your throat one day . She been in the crazy house in Mandeville . You gon na see , Verise . " <p> " I ai n't seen her . " <p> " You sonofabitch , I smell her on you , " my mother said , and she swung a headless chicken by its feet and whipped a diagonal line of blood across my father 's chest and Levis . <p> " You ai n't gon na act like that in front of my children , you , " he said , and started toward her . Then he stopped . " Y'all get inside . You ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and her . " <p> My two older brothers , Weldon and Lyle , were used to our parents , quarrels , and they went inside sullenly and let the back screen slam behind them . But my little sister Drew , whom my mother nicknamed " Little Britches , " stood mute and fearful and alone under the pecan tree , her cat pressed flat against her chest . <p> " Come on , Drew . Come see inside . We 're gon na play with the Monopoly game , " I said , and tried to pull her by the arm . But her body was rigid , her bare feet immobile in the dust . <p> Then I saw my father 's large , square hand go up in the air , saw it come down hard against the side of my mother 's face , heard the sound of her weeping , as I tried to step into Drew 's line of vision and hold her and her cat against my body , hold the three of us tightly together outside the unrelieved sound of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through the railing on the bridge over the Atchafalaya River . I dreamed that night that an enormous brown bubble arose from the submerged wreck , and when it burst on the surface her drowned breath stuck against my face as wet and rank as gas released from a grave . <p> That fall I began to feel sick all the time , as though a gray cloud of mosquitoes were feeding at my heart . During recess at school I did n't play with the other children and instead hung about on the edges of the dusty playground or , when Brother Daniel was n't looking , slipped around the side of the old red-brick cathedral and sat by myself on a stone bench in a bamboo-enclosed , oak-shaded garden where a statue of Mary rested in a grotto and camellia petals floated in a big goldfish pond . Sometimes Sister Roberta was there saying her rosary . <p> She was built like a fire hydrant . Were it not for the additional size that the swirl of her black habit and the wings of her veil gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in her fifth-grade class . She did n't yell at us or hit our knuckles with rulers like the other nuns did , and in fact she always called us " little people " rather than children . But sometimes her round face would flare with anger below her white , starched wimple at issues which to us in our small parochial world seemed of little importance . She told our class once that criminals and corrupt local politicians were responsible for the slot and racehorse machines that were in every drugstore , bar , and hotel lobby in New Iberia , and another time she flung an apple core at a carload of teenagers who were baiting the Negro janitor out by the school incinerator . <p> She heard my feet on the dead oak leaves when I walked through the opening in the bamboo into the garden . She was seated on the stone bench , her back absolutely erect , the scarlet beads of her rosary stretched across the back of her pale hand like drops of blood . She stopped her prayer and turned her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip . <p> " Do you feel sick again , Billy Bob ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , Sister . " <p> " Come here . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I said come here . " Her hand reached out and held my forehead . Then she wiped the moisture off her palm with her fingers . " Have you been playing or running ? " <p> " No , Sister . " <p> " Has your father taken you to a doctor ? " <p> I did n't answer . <p> " Look at me and answer my question , " she said . <p> " He do n't , he does n't have money right now . He says it 's because I had the flu . He boiled some honey and onions for me to eat . It made me feel better . It 's true , Sister . " <p> " I need to talk to your father . " <p> She saw me swallow . <p> " Would he mind my calling him ? " she asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " <p> " Will he be home tonight ? " <p> " I 'm not sure . " <p> " Who takes care of you at night when he 's not home ? " <p> " A lady , a friend of his . " <p> " I see . Come back to the classroom with me . It 's too windy out here for you , " she said . <p> " Sister , you do n't need to call , do you ? I feel okay now . My father 's got a lot on his mind now . He really works hard . " <p> " What 's wrong in your house , Billy Bob ? " <p> " Nothing . I promise , Sister . " I tried to smile . I could taste bile in my throat . <p> " Do n't lie . " <p> " I 'm not . I promise I 'm not . " <p> " Yes , I can see that clearly . Come with me . " <p> The rest of the recess period she and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stringing long curlicues of colored wax into the waste basket . She was as silent and as seemingly self-absorbed as a statue . Just before the bell rang she walked down to the convent and came back with a tube of toothpaste . <p> " Your breath is bad . Go down to the lavatory and wash your mouth out with this , " she said . <p> Mattie wore shorts and sleeveless blouses with sweat rings under the arms , and in the daytime she always seemed to have cutlers in her hair . When she walked from room to room she carried an ashtray with her into which she constantly flicked her lipstick-stained Chesterfields . She had a hard , muscular body , and she did n't close the bathroom door all the way when she bathed , and once I saw her kneeling in the tub , scrubbing her big shoulders and chest with a large , flat brush . The area above her head was crisscrossed with improvised clotheslines from which dripped her wet underthings . Her eyes fastened on mine ; I thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead her hardboned , shiny face continued to look back at me with a vacuous indifference that made me feel obscene . <p> If my father was out of town on a Friday or Saturday night , she fixed our supper ( sometimes meat on Friday , the fear in our eyes not worthy of her recognition ) , put on her blue suit , and sat by herself in the living room , listening to the Grand Ole Opry or the Louisiana Hayride , while she drank apricot brandy from a coffee cup . She always dropped cigarette ashes on her suit and had to spot-clean the cloth with dry cleaning fluid before she drove off for the evening in her old Ford coupe . I do n't know where she went on those Friday or Saturday nights , but a boy down the road told me that Mattie used to work in Broussard 's Bar on Railroad Avenue , an infamous area in New Iberia where the women sat on the galleries of the cribs , dipping their beer out of buckets and yelling at the railroad and oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when my father was in Morgan City a man in a new silver Chevrolet sedan came out to see her . It was hot , and he parked his car partly on our grass to keep it in the shade . He wore sideburns , striped brown zoot slacks , two-tone shoes , suspenders , a pink shirt without a coat , and a fedora that shadowed his narrow face . While he talked to her he put one shoe on the car bumper and wiped the dust off it with a rag . Then their voices grew louder and he said , " You like the life . Admit it , you . He ai n't given you no wedding ring , . has he ? You do n't buy the cow , no , when you can milk through the fence . " <p> " I am currently involved with a gentleman . I do not know what you are talking about . I am not interested in anything you are talking about , " she said . <p> He threw the rag back inside the car and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trade , or travel , darlin ' , " he said . " Same rules here as down on Railroad . He done made you a nigger woman for them children , Mattie . " <p> " Are you calling me a nigra ? " she said quietly . <p> " No , I 'm calling you crazy , just like everybody say you are . No , I take that back , me . I ai n't calling you nothing . I ai n't got to , cause you gon na be back . You in the life , Mattie . You be phoning me to come out here , bring you to the crib , rub your back , put some of that warm stuff in your arm again . Ai n't nobody else do that for you , huh ? " <p> When she came back into the house she made us take all the dishes out of the cabinets , even though they were clean , and wash them over again . <p> It was the following Friday that Sister Roberta called . Mattie was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn down the radio when she answered the phone , and in order to compete with Red Foley 's voice she had to almost shout into the receiver . <p> " Mr. Sonnier is not here , " she said . " Mr. Sonnier is away on business in Texas City .... No , ma'am , I 'm not the housekeeper . I 'm a friend of the family who is caring for these children .... There 's nothing wrong with that boy that I can see .... Are you calling to tell me that there 's something wrong , that I 'm doing something wrong ? What is it that I 'm doing wrong ? I would like to know that . What is your name ? " <p> I stood transfixed with terror in the hall as she bent angrily into the mouthpiece and her knuckles ridged on the receiver . A storm was blowing in from the Gulf , the air smelled of ozone , and the southern horizon was black with thunderclouds that pulsated with white veins of lightning . I heard the wind ripping through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery roof like grapeshot . <p> When Mattie hung up the phone the skin of her face was stretched as tight as a lampshade and one liquid eye was narrowed at me like someone aiming down a rifle barrel . <p> The next week , when I was cutting through the neighbor 's sugarcane field on the way home from school , my heart started to race for no reason , my spit tasted like pecans , my face filmed with perspiration even though the wind was cool through the stalks of cane ; then I saw the oaks and cypress trees along Bayou Teche tilt at an angle , and I dropped my books and fell forward in the dirt as though someone had wrapped a chain around my chest and snapped my breastbone . <p> I lay with the side of my face pressed against the dirt , my mouth gasping like a fish 's , until Weldon found me and went crashing through the cane for help . A doctor came out to the house that night , examined me and gave me a shot , then talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand the doctor 's vocabulary , and he said , " What hind of fever that is ? " <p> " Rheumatic , Mr. Sonnier . It attacks the heart . I could be wrong , but I think that 's what your boy 's got . I 'll be back tomorrow . " <p> " How much this gon na cost ? " <p> " It 's three dollars a visit , but you can pay me when you 're able . " <p> " We never had nothing like this in our family . You sure about this ? " <p> " No , I 'm not . That 's why I 'll be back . Good night to you , sir . " <p> I knew he did n't like my father , but he came to see me one afternoon a week for a month , brought me bottles of medicine , and always looked into my face with genuine concern after he listened to my heart . Then one night he and my father argued and he did n't come back . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You still sick , ai n't you ? A doctor do n't make money off well people . I think maybe you got malaria , son . There ai n't nothing for that either . It just goes away . You gon na see , you . You stay in bed , you eat cush-cush Mattie and me make for you , you drink that Hadacol vitamin tonic , you wear this dime I 'm tying on you , you gon na get well and go back to school . " <p> He tied a perforated dime on a piece of red twine around my neck . His face was lean and unshaved , and his turquoise eyes were as intense as a butane flame when he looked into mine . <p> " You blame me for your mama ? " he asked . <p> " No , sir , " I lied . <p> " I did n't mean to hit her . But she made me look bad in front of y'all . A woman ca n't be doing that to a man in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daddy . " <p> " Do n't be saying that . " <p> " She hit Weldon with the belt . She made Drew kneel in the bathroom corner because she did n't flush the toilet . " <p> " She 's just trying to be a mother , that 's all . Do n't talk no more . Go to sleep . I got to drive back to Texas City tonight . You gon na be all right . " <p> He closed my door and the inside of my room was absolutely black . Through the wall I heard him and Mattie talking , then the weight of their bodies creaking rhythmically on the bedsprings . <p> When Sister Roberta knew that I would not be back to school that semester she began bringing my lessons to the house . She came three afternoons a week , and she had to walk two miles each way between the convent and our house . Each time I successfully completed a lesson she rewarded me with a holy card . Each holy card had a prayer on one side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saints glowing with light or ethereal paintings of Mary with the Infant Jesus . On the day after my father had tied the dime around my neck Sister Roberta had to walk past our neighbor 's field right after he had cut his cane and burned off the stubble , and a wet wind had streaked her black habit with ashes . As soon as she came through my bedroom door her face tightened inside her wimple , and her brown eyes , which had flecks of red in them , grew round and hot , and she dropped her book bag on the foot of my bed and leaned within six inches of my face as though she were looking down at a horrid presence in the bottom of a well . The hair on her upper lip looked like pieces of silver thread . <p> " Who put that around your neck ? " she asked . <p> " My father says it keeps the gris-gris away . " <p> " My suffering God , " she said , and went back out the door in a swirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " That 's right , madam . Scissors . So I can remove that cord from his neck before he strangles to death in his sleep . Thank you kindly . " <p> She came back into my bedroom , pulled the twine out from my throat with one finger , and snipped it in two . <p> " Do you believe in this nonsense , Billy Bob ? " she said . <p> " No , Sister . " <p> " That 's good . You 're a good Catholic boy , and you must n't believe . in superstition . Do you love the church ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> " Hmmmm . That does n't sound entirely convincing . Do you love your father ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " I see . Do you love your sister and your brothers ? " <p> " Yes . Most of the time I do . " <p> " That 's good . Because if you love somebody , or if you love the church , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . People are only superstitious when they 're afraid . That 's an important lesson for little people to learn . Now , let 's take a look at our math test for this week . " <p> Over her shoulder I saw Mattie looking at us from the living room , her hair in foam-rubber curiers , her face contorted as though a piece of barbed wire were twisting behind her eyes . <p> That winter my father started working regular hours , what he called " an indoor job , " at the Monsanto Chemical Company in Texas City , and we saw him only on weekends . Mattie cooked only the evening meal and made us responsible for the care of the house and the other two meals . Weldon started to get into trouble at school . His eighth-grade teacher , a lay woman , called and said he had thumbtacked a girl 's dress to the desk during class , causing her to almost tear it off her body when the bell rang , and he would either pay for the dress or be suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days later the girl 's father , a sheriff 's deputy , came out to the house and made Mattie give him four dollars on the gallery . <p> She came back inside , slamming the door , her face burning , grabbed Weldon by the collar of his T-shirt and walked him into the backyard , where she made him stand for two hours on an upended apple crate until he wet his pants . <p> Later , after she had let him come back inside and he had changed his underwear and blue jeans , he went outside into the dark by himself , without eating supper , and sat on the butcher stump , striking kitchen matches on the side of the box and throwing them at the chickens . Before we went to sleep he sat for a long time on the side of his bed , next to mine , in a square of moonlight with his hands balled into fists on his thighs . There were knots of muscle in the backs of his arms and behind his ears . Mattie had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scalped as a baseball . <p> " Tomorrow 's Saturday . We 're going to listen to the LSU-Rice game , " I said . <p> " Some colored kids saw me from the road and laughed . " <p> " I do n't care what they did . You 're brave , Weldon . You 're braver than any of us . " <p> " I 'm gon na fix her . " <p> His voice made me afraid . The branches of the pecan trees were skeletal , like gnarled fingers against the moon . <p> " Do n't be thinking like that , " I said . " It 'll just make her do worse things . She takes it out on Drew when you and Lyle are n't here . " <p> " Go to sleep , Billy Bob , " he said . His eyes were wet . " She hurts us because we let her . We ax for it . You get hurt when you do n't stand up . Just like Momma did . " <p> I heard him snuffling in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the opposite wall . His head looked carved out of gray wood in the moonlight . <p> I went back to school for the spring semester , and because of the warmth of the season , the balmy winds off the Gulf , the flaming azaleas in people 's yards , the heavy , fecund smell of magnolia and wisteria on the night air , I wanted to believe that a new season was beginning in my heart as well . I could n't control what happened at home , but the school was a safe place , one where Sister Roberta ruled her little fifthgrade world like an affectionate despot . <p> I was always fascinated by her hands . They were like toy hands , small as a child 's , as pink as an early rose , the nails not much bigger than pearls . She was wonderful at sketching and drawing with crayons and colored chalk . In minutes she could create a beautiful religious scene on the blackboard to fit the church 's season , but she also drew pictures for us of Easter rabbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outline of a figure  --  an archangel with enormous wings , a Roman soldier about to be dazzled by a blinding light  --  and she would let us take turns coloring in the solid areas . She told us the secret to great classroom art was to always keep your chalk and crayons pointy . <p> Then we began to hear rumors about Sister Roberta , of a kind that we had never heard about any of the nuns , who all seemed to have no lives other than the ones that were immediately visible to us . She had been heard weeping in the confessional , she had left the convent for three days without permission , two detectives from Baton Rouge had questioned her in the mother superior 's office . <p> She missed a week of school , and a lay teacher took her place . She returned for two weeks , then was gone again . When she came back the second time she was soft-spoken and removed , and sometimes she did n't even bother to answer simple questions that we asked her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though her attention were fixed on a distant object , then a noise  --  a creaking desk , an eraser flung from the cloakroom  --  would disturb her , and her eyes would return to the room , absolutely empty of thought or meaning . <p> I stayed after school on a Friday to help her wash the blackboards and pound erasers . " You do n't need to , Billy Bob . The janitor will take care of it , " she said . <p> She was putting paper clips one by one in a box on top of her desk . <p> " All the kids like you , Sister , " I said . <p> " What ? " she said . <p> " You 're the only one who plays with us at recess . You do n't ever get mad at us , either . Not for real , anyway . " <p> " It 's nice of you to say that , but the other sisters are good to you , too . " <p> " Not like you are . " <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She had lost weight , and there was a solitary crease , like a line drawn by a thumbnail , in each of her cheeks . <p> " It 's wrong for you to be sad , " I said . <p> " You must run along home now . Do n't say anything more . " <p> I wish you were my mother , I thought I heard myself say inside my head . <p> " What did you say ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Tell me what you said . " <p> " I do n't think I said anything . I really do n't think I did . " <p> My heart was beating against my rib cage , the same way it had the day I fell unconscious in the sugarcane field . <p> " Billy Bob , do n't try to understand the world . It 's not ours to understand , " she said . " You must give up the things you ca n't change . You must n't talk to me like this anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the room , my soul painted with an unrelieved shame that knew no words . <p> The next week I found out the source of Sister Roberta 's grief . A strange and seedy man by the name of Mr. Trajan , who always had an American flag pin in his lapel when you saw him inside the wire-cage office of the grocery and package store he operated by the Negro district , cut an article from copies of the Baton Rouge Morning Advocate and the Lafayette Daily Advertiser and mailed it to other Catholic businessmen in town . An eighth-grader who had been held back twice , once by Sister Roberta , brought it to school one day , and after the three o'clock bell Lyle , Weldon , and I heard him reading it to a group . of dumbfounded boys on the playground . The words hung in the air like our first exposure to God 's name being deliberately used in vain . <p> Her brother had killed a child , and Sister Roberta had helped him to hide in a fishing camp in West Baton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weldon said , and tore the news article out of the boy 's hand . He stared hard at it , then wadded it up and threw it on the ground . " Get the fuck out of here . You go around talking about this again and I 'll kick your ass . " <p> " That 's right , you dumb fuck , " Lyle said , putting his new baseball cap in his back pocket and setting his book satchel down by his foot . <p> " That 's right , butt face , " I added , incredulous at the boldness of my own words . <p> " Yeah ? " the boy said , but the resolve in his voice was already breaking . <p> " Yeah ! " Weldon said , and shoved him off balance . Then he picked up a rock and chased the boy and three of his friends toward the street . Lyle and I followed , picking up dirt clods in our hands . When the boy was almost to his father 's waiting pickup truck , he turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye with the rock . <p> One of the brothers marched us down to Father Higgins ' office and left us there to wait for Father Higgins , whose razor strop and blackIrish , crimson-faced tirades were legendary in the school . The office smelled of the cigar butts in the wastebasket and the cracked leather in the chairs . A walnut pendulum clock ticked loudly on the wall . It was overcast outside , and we sat in the gloom and silence until four o'clock . <p> " I ai n't waiting any more . Y'all coming ? " Weldon said , and put one leg out the open window . <p> " You 'll get expelled , " I said . <p> " Too bad . I ai n't going to wait around just to have somebody whip me , " he said , and dropped out the window . <p> Five minutes later Lyle followed him . <p> The sound of the clock was like a spoon knocking on a hollow wood box . When Father Higgins finally entered the room , he wore his hornrimmed glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clipboard . The hairline on the back of his neck was shaved neatly with a razor . At first he seemed distracted by my presence , then he flipped the sheets of paper to a particular page , almost as an afterthought , and studied it . He put an unlit cigar stub in his mouth , looked at me , then back at the page . <p> " You threw a rock at somebody ? " he said . <p> " No , Father . " <p> " Somebody threw a rock at you ? " <p> " I would n't say that . " <p> " You would n't say that ? Then what are you doing here ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " That 's interesting . All right , since you do n't know why you 're here , how about going somewhere else ? " <p> " I 'll take him , Father , " I heard Sister Roberta say in the doorway . She put her hand on my arm , walked me down the darkly polished corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone bench inside the bamboo-enclosed garden where she often said her rosary . <p> She sat next to me , her small white hands curved on the edges of the bench , and looked down at the goldfish pond while she talked . A crushed paper cup floated among the hyacinth leaves . <p> " You meant well , Billy Bob , " she said , " but I do n't want you to defend me anymore . It 's not the job of little people to defend adults , " <p> " Sister , it said  --  " <p> " It said what ? " <p> " You were in trouble with the police . Can they put you in jail ? " <p> She put her hand on top of mine . Her fingernails looked like tiny pink seashells . " They 're not really interested in me , Billy Bob .

Her voice clicked wetly in her throat . " He 'll be spared , not because he 's a sick man , but because it was a colored child he killed . " <p> When I looked at her again her long eyelashes were bright with tears . <p> She stood up with her face turned away from me . The sun had broken through the gray seal of clouds , and the live oak tree overhead was filled with the clattering of mockingbirds and bluejays . I felt her tiny fingernails rake gently through my hair , as though she were combing a cat . <p> " Oh you poor child , there 're lice eggs in your hair , " she said . <p> Then she pressed my head against her breast , and I felt her tears strike hotly on the back of my neck . <p> Three days later Sister saw the cigarette burn on Drew 's leg in the lunchroom and reported it to the social welfare agency in town . A consumptive rail of a man in a dandruff-flecked blue suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery , then questioned us in front of Mattie . Drew told him she had been burned by an ember that had popped out of a trash fire in the backyard . <p> He raised her chin with his knuckle . His black hair was stiff with grease . <p> " Is that what happened ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , sir . " Drew 's face was dull , her mouth downturned at the corners . The burn was scabbed now and looked like a tightly coiled gray worm on her skin . <p> He smiled and took his knuckle away from her chin . " Then you should n't play next to the fire , " he said . <p> " I would like to know who sent you out here , " Mattie said . <p> " That 's confidential . " He coughed on the back of his hand . His shirt cuff was frayed on his thin wrist . " And to tell you the truth , I do n't really know . My supervisor did n't tell me . " He coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could smell his deep-lung nicotine odor . " But everything here looks all right . " <p> Weldon 's eyes were as hard as marbles , but he did n't speak . <p> The man walked with Mattie to his car , and I felt like doors were slamming all around us . She put her foot on his running board and propped one arm on his car roof while she talked , so that her breasts were uplifted against her blouse and her dress made a loop between her legs . <p> " Let 's tell him , " Lyle said . <p> " Are you kidding ? Look at him . She could make him eat her shit with a spoon , " Weldon said . <p> It was right after first period the next morning that we heard about the disaster at Texas City . Somebody shouted something about it on the playground , then suddenly the whole school was abuzz with rumors .

The force of the secondary explosion was so great that it blew out windows in Houston , fifty miles away . But it was n't over yet . The fireball mushroomed laterally out into an adjacent oil field , and rows of storage tanks and wellheads went like strings of Chinese firecrackers . People said the water in the harbor boiled from the heat , the spars on steel derricks melted like licorice . <p> We heard nothing about the fate of my father either that afternoon or evening . Mattie got drunk that night and fell asleep in the livingroom chair by the radio . I felt nothing about my father 's possible death , and I wondered at my own callousness . We went to school the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mattie was waiting on the gallery to tell us that a man from the Monsanto company had telephoned and said that my father was listed as missing . Her eyes were pink with either hangover or crying , and her face was puffy and round , like a white balloon . <p> When we did n't respond , she said , " Your father may be dead . Do you understand what I 'm saying ? That was an important man from his company who called . He would not call unless he was gravely concerned . Do you children understand what is being said to you ? " <p> Weldon brushed at the dirt with his tennis shoe , and Lyle looked into a place about six inches in front of his eyes . Drew 's face was frightened , not because of the news about our father , but instead because of the strange whirring of wheels that we could almost hear from inside Mattie 's head . I put my arm over her shoulders and felt her skin jump .. <p> " He 's worked like a nigra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have nothing to say ? " she asked . <p> " Maybe we ought to start cleaning up our rooms . You wanted us to clean up our rooms , Mattie , " I said . <p> But it was a poor attempt to placate her . <p> " You stay outside . Do n't even come in this house , " she said . <p> " I have to go to the bathroom , " Lyle said . <p> " Then you can just do it in the dirt like a darky , " she said , and went inside the house and latched the screen behind her . <p> By the next afternoon my father was still unaccounted for . Mattie had an argument on the phone with somebody , I think the man in zoot pants and two-tone shoes who had probably been her pimp at one time , because she told him he owed her money and she would n't come back and work at Broussard 's Bar again until he paid her . After she hung up she breathed hard at the kitchen sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She snapped the cap off a bottle of Jax and drank it half-empty , her throat working in one long , wet swallow , one eye cocked at me . <p> " Come here , " she said . <p> " What ? " <p> " You tracked up the kitchen . You did n't flush the toilet after you used it , either . " <p> " I did . " <p> " You did what ? " <p> " I flushed the toilet . " <p> " Then one of the others did n't flush it . Every one of you come out here . Now ! " <p> " What is it , Mattie ? We did n't do anything , " I said . <p> " I changed my mind . Every one of you outside . All of you outside . Weldon and Lyle , you get out there right now . Where 's Drew ? " <p> " She 's playing in the yard . What 's wrong , Mattie ? " I made no attempt to hide the fear in my voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of her muscular chest . <p> Outside the wind was blowing through the trees in the yard , flattening the purple clumps of wisteria that grew against the barn wall . <p> " Each of you go to the hedge and cut the switch you want me to use on you , " she said . <p> It was her favorite form of punishment for us . If we broke off a large switch , she hit us fewer times with it . If we came back with a thin or small switch , we would get whipped until she felt she had struck some kind of balance between size and number . <p> We remained motionless . Drew had been playing with her cat . She had tied a piece of twine around the cat 's neck , and she held the twine in her hand like a leash . Her knees and white socks were dusty from play . <p> " I told you not to tie that around the kitten 's neck again , " Mattie said . <p> " It does n't hurt anything . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Do n't sass me , " she said . " You will not sass me . None of you will sass me . " <p> " I ai n't cutting no switch , " Weldon said . " You 're crazy . My mama said so . You ought to be in the crazy house . " <p> She looked hard into Weldon 's eyes , and there was a moment of recognition in her colorless face , as though she had seen a growing meanness of spirit in Weldon that was the equal of her own . Then she wet her lips , crimped them together , and rubbed her hands on her thighs . <p> " We shall see who does what around here , " she said . She broke off a big switch from the myrtle hedge and raked it free of flowers and leaves , except for one green sprig on the tip . <p> I saw the look in Drew 's face , saw her drop the piece of twine from her palm as she looked up into Mattie 's shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen times across her bare legs . Drew twisted impotently in Mattie 's balled hand , her feet dancing with each blow . The switch raised welts on her skin as thick and red as centipedes . <p> Then suddenly Weldon ran with all his weight into Mattie 's back , stiff-arming her between the shoulder blades , and sent her tripping sideways over a bucket of chicken slops . She righted herself and stared at him open-mouthed , the switch limp in her hand . Then her eyes grew hot and bright with a painful intention , and I could see the bone flex along her jaws . <p> Weldon burst out the back gate and ran down the dirt road between the sugarcane fields , the soles of his dirty tennis shoes powdering dust in the air . <p> She waited for him a long time , watching through the screen as the mauve-colored dusk gathered in the trees and the sun 's afterglow lit the clouds on the western horizon with flame . Then she took a bottle of apricot brandy into the bathroom and sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap on and off until the tank was empty . When we needed to go to the bathroom , she told us to take our problem outside . Finally she emerged in the hall , wearing only her panties and bra , her hair wrapped in a towel , the dark outline of her sex plainly visible to us . <p> " I 'm going to dress now and go into town with a gentleman friend , " she said . " Tomorrow we 're going to start a new regime around here . Believe me , there will never be a reoccurrence of what happened here today . You can pass that on to young Mr. Weldon for me . " <p> But she did n't go into town . Instead , she put on her blue suit , a flower-print blouse , her nylon stockings , and walked up and down on the gallery , her cigarette poised in the air like a movie actress . <p> " Why not just drive your car , Mattie ? " I said quietly through the screen . <p> " It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing for me anytime now , " she answered . <p> " Oh . " <p> She blew smoke at an upward angle , her face aloof and flat-sided in the shadows . <p> " Mattie ? " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Weldon 's out back . Can he come in the house ? " <p> " Little mice always return where the cheese is , " she said . <p> I hated her . I wanted something terrible to happen to her . I could feel my fingernails kniving into my palms . <p> She turned on one high heel , her palm supporting one elbow , her cigarette an inch from her mouth , her hair wreathed in smoke . <p> " Do you have a reason for staring through the screen at me ? " she asked . <p> " No , " I said . <p> " When you 're bigger you 'll get to do what 's on your mind . In the meantime , do n't let your thoughts show on your face . You 're a lewd little boy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my eyes . I backed away from the screen , then turned and ran through the rear of the house and out into the backyard where Weldon , Lyle , and Drew sat against the barn wall , fireflies lighting in the wisteria over their heads . <p> No one came for Mattie that evening . She sat in the stuffed chair in her room , putting on layers of lipstick until her mouth had the crooked , bright-red shape of a clown 's . She smoked a whole package of Chesterfields , constantly wiping the ashes off her dark-blue skirt with a hand towel soaked in dry-cleaning fluid ; then she drank herself unconscious . <p> It was hot that night , and dry lightning leaped from the horizon to the top of the blue-black vault of sky over the Gulf . Weldon sat on the side of his bed in the dark , his shoulders hunched , his fists between his white thighs . His burr haircut looked like duck down on his head in the flicker of the lightning through the window . When I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We got to get rid of her . You know we got to do it . " <p> I put my pillow over my head and rolled away from him , as though I could drop away into sleep and rise in the morning into a sun-spangled and different world . <p> But in the false dawn I woke to both Lyle and Weldon 's faces close to mine . Weldon 's eyes were hollow , his breath rank with funk . The mist was heavy and wet in the pecan trees outside the window . <p> " She 's not gon na hurt Drew again . Are you gon na help or not ? " Weldon said . <p> I followed them into the hallway , my heart sinking at the realization of what I was willing to participate in , my body as numb as if I had been stunned with Novocaine . Mattie slept in the stuffed chair , her hose rolled down over her knees , an overturned jelly glass on the rug next to the can of spot cleaner . <p> Weldon walked quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laid the can on its side in front of Mattie 's feet , then backed away from her . The cleaning fluid spread in a dark circle around her chair , the odor as bright and sharp as a slap across the face . <p> Weldon slid open a box of kitchen matches and we each took one , raked it across the striker , and , with the sense that our lives at that moment had changed forever , threw them at Mattie 's feet . But the burning matches fell outside the wet area . The blood veins in my head dilated with fear , my ears hummed with a sound like the roar of the ocean in a seashell , and I jerked the box from Weldon 's hand , clutched a half-dozen matches in my fist , dragged them across the striker , and flung them right on Mattie 's feet . <p> The chair was enveloped in a cone of flame , and she burst out of it with her arms extended , as though she were pushing blindly through a curtain , her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair burning as she raced past us and crashed through the screen door out onto the gallery and into the yard . She beat at her flaming clothes and raked at her hair as though it were swarming with yellow jackets . <p> I stood transfixed in mortal dread at what I had done . <p> A Negro man walking to work came out of the mist on the road and knocked her to the ground , slapping the fire out of her dress , pinning her under his spread knees as though he were assaulting her . Smoke rose from her scorched clothes and hair as in a depiction of a damned figure on one of my holy cards . <p> The Negro rose to his feet and walked toward the gallery , a solitary line of blood running down his black cheek where Mattie had scratched him . <p> " Yo ' mama ai n't hurt bad . Get some butter or some bacon grease . She gon na be all right , you gon na see . You children do n't be worried , no , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure us that everything would be all right . <p> The volunteer firemen bounced across the cattleguard in an old firetruck whose obsolete hand-crank starter still dangled from under the radiator . They coated Mattie 's room with foam from a fire extinguisher and packed Mattie off in an ambulance to the charity hospital in Lafayette . Two sheriff 's deputies arrived , and before he left , one of the volunteers took them aside in the yard and talked with them , looking over his shoulder at us children , then walked over to us and said , " The fire chief gon na come out here and check it out . Y'all stay out of that bedroom . " <p> His face was narrow and dark with shadow under the brim of his big rubber fireman 's hat . <p> I felt a fist squeeze my heart . <p> But suddenly Sister Roberta was in the midst of everything . Someone had carried word to the school about the fire , and she 'd had one of the brothers drive her out to the house . She talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , made telephone calls to find a place for us to stay besides the welfare shelter . Then she looked in Mattie 's bedroom door and studied the interior for what seemed a long time . When she came back in the kitchen her eyes peeled the skin off our faces . I looked straight down into my cereal bowl . <p> She placed her small hand on my shoulder . I could feel her fingers tapping on the bone , as though she were processing her own thoughts . Then she said , " Well , what should we do here today ? I think we should clean up first . Where 's the broom ? " <p> Without waiting for an answer she pulled the broom out of the closet and went to work in Mattie 's room , sweeping the spilled and unstruck matches as well as the burned ones in a pile by a side door that gave onto the yard . The soot and blackened threads from the rug swirled up in a cloud around her veils and wings and smudged her starched wimple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broomstick . <p> " There ai n't been an investigation yet . You ca n't do that till the fire chief come out and see , Sister , " he said . <p> " You always talked like a fool , Gaspard , " she said . " Now that you have a uniform , you talk like a bigger one . This house smells like an incinerator . Now get out of the way . " <p> With one sweep of the broom she raked all the matches out into the yard . <p> We were placed in foster homes , and over the years I lost contact with Sister Roberta . But later I went to work in the oil fields , and I think perhaps I talked with my father in a nightclub outside of Morgan City . An enormous live oak tree grew through the floor and roof , and he was leaning against the bar that had been built in a circle around the tree . His face was puckered with white scar tissue , his ears burnt into stubs , his right hand atrophied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But beyond the layers of mutilated skin I could see my father 's face , like the image in a photographic negative held up against a light . <p> " Is your name Sonnier ? " I asked . <p> He looked at me curiously . <p> " Maybe . You want to buy me a drink ? " he said . <p> " All right , " I said . <p> He ordered a shot of Beam with a frosted schooner of Jax on the side . <p> " Are you Verise Sonnier from New Iberia ? " I asked . <p> He grinned stiffly when he took the schooner of beer away from his mouth . <p> " Why you want to know ? " he said . <p> " I think I 'm your son . I 'm Billy Bob . " <p> His turquoise eyes wandered over my face , then they lost interest . <p> " I had a son . But you ai n't him , " he said . " Buy me another shot ? " <p> " Sure . Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my dreams , and I wonder if ironically all our stories were written on his skin back there in Texas City in 1947 . Or maybe that 's just a poetic illusion purchased by time . But even in the middle of an Indian summer 's day , when the sugarcane is beaten with purple and gold light in the fields and the sun is both warm and cool on your skin at the same time , when I know that the earth is a fine place after all , I have to mourn just a moment for those people of years ago who lived lives they did not choose , who carried burdens that were not their own , whose invisible scars were as private as the scarlet beads of Sister Roberta 's rosary wrapped across the back of her small hand , as bright as drops of blood ringed round the souls of little people . <p> <p> By JAMES LEE BURKE <p>
