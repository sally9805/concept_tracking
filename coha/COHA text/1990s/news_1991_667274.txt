<p> The information squeeze was on , and tensions between the press and the military brass were heating up . Then Gen. Colin Powell , cool as a January night in the desert , spoke : <p> " Trust me . Trust me , " the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the assembled press corps last week as he showed them a graph of Iraqi radar activity . He gave them a sly smile . Some in the audience could n't help laughing . <p> Trust is n't a word the U.S. public has used lately in connection with its military leaders . But the military brass turning up night after night on our television screens - the Colin Powells , the Norman Schwarzkopfs - seem to signal a new breed of leadership : calm , compassionate , highly educated , politically astute and media-savvy . These are career military men with an extra dimension . " These guys are fathers , grandfathers and thinking men , " says Martin Binkin , military analyst at the Brookings Institution . " They are very articulate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters that flies in the face of the stereotypical image of military leader as Rambo . " <p> Eisenhower was a statesman , Patton a warrior , Marshall a master planner . Anyone aspiring to the top today must be all those things and a top-notch manager as well . So how is the military able to attract the best and brightest - young people who could choose Harvard or Stanford over the Naval Academy or West Point , then climb the ladder at any of the best U.S. companies ? <p> Patriotism tops the list of reasons people are drawn to the military life . " They are dedicated . They 're sincere about it , " says Jay Kosminsky , deputy director of defense-policy studies for the Heritage Foundation . " These are n't people who went into the military because they could n't find another job . " Most are inclined toward public service , many are following family tradition . Some like the structure , others crave adventure . <p> Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot , a former Navy officer , joined on a whim . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , had gone to the Naval Academy , and Perot figured he 'd try it , too . " I 'd never seen the ocean . I 'd never seen a ship , " he says . <p> Some " yearn for a sense of belonging " they do n't get in civilian life , says William Hauser , a retired Army colonel who is director of executive resources for Pfizer Pharmaceutical Co . They are willing to forgo the six- figure - or even seven-figure - salaries enjoyed by their counterparts in the business world , endure a life of regimentation and constant moves and risk their lives in battle . <p> Would-be officers learn at a young age whether they can hack a military career . At the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. , " the first year is tough , " says spokeswoman Carol Feldmann . " You must wear a uniform 24 hours a day , keep your room neat , fold your clothes correctly , study at night , go to all your classes , keep your hair cut , have your uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . All of that is not easy for the average American teen-ager . " <p> Bill Maloney , 61 - a former three-star general in the Marines who now is president of InterBev Ltd. , a trade-show production and management company in Washington , D.C. - never intended to make the military a career . He had a full scholarship to Brown University through the Navy Reserve Officers ' Training Corps and was required to serve as a platoon commander in the Korean War . But his first combat experience there convinced him there was nothing more important he could do than be responsible for the lives of others . He retired from the Marines in 1985 after 35 years . <p> " I realized the assets I was dealing with were priceless - they were people , " he says . " I 'd give my hat , ass and mess kit to go ( to the Persian Gulf ) in a heartbeat . But the one thing they do n't need is a bunch of overage generals . " <p> The new military leader exhibits skills more commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been parallels between the military regimen and life in the executive suite . Leadership is emphasized , discipline is required . And many of today 's titans of industry got their start in the services - including Perot , a former lieutenant who left the Navy for IBM at 27 ; Rand Araskog of ITT Corp. , a West Point graduate ; and Fred Smith , chief executive officer of Federal Express , a former Marine platoon commander . <p> But does military training really mold the ideal corporate manager ? Experts disagree . <p> Maloney thinks his military training was good preparation for running a profit-making venture . " I like to think a busy militaryman decides each day what not to do because there 's too much to do . A businessman has to do the same thing . " The idea that budgets are n't a concern in the military is a myth , he says . " For example , " he says , " you have to maximize every minute of airborne training . I call that return on investment . In the military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to enormous cultural differences between the military and the private sector . <p> Military people " speak , talk and think a different language , " says Peter McCarthy , a Washington , D.C. , job counselor and retired Marine lieutenant colonel . " In the military , P &L; means profession and loyalty . In the civilian world , it 's profit and loss , " he says . <p> Hauser 's theory is that the practice of rapid promotion in the military - it 's not uncommon for promising officers to move up every year or year-and-a- half - creates a superficial manager who " skims the surface of every job and never gets down to the details . " The reason for the practice , the retired colonel says : to keep the best officers happy so they wo n't be tempted by higher salaries on the outside . <p> Many military officers who do go into the private sector end up " slaves to bureaucratic procedure , " Hauser says , out-of-sync in the more freewheeling civilian world . " They tend to come into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give me the rules . ' " <p> No one puts Powell or Schwarzkopf in that category . Powell , 53 , seems to have navigated the system unscathed . Although he got C 's and some D 's at City College of New York , he rose quickly in the military after joining through the Army ROTC . Eventually , he was tapped by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger for a series of White House posts . The son of poor Jamaican immigrants who grew up in Harlem and the South Bronx in New York City , he has an M.B.A . from George Washington University and is " a born leader , " says Weinberger . " He could do any job he wanted to do . " He could also earn a lot more than his $ 101,000 base pay . <p> Despite his image as a lumbering bear , the 6-foot-3 , 240-pound Stormin ' Norman Schwarzkopf , 56 , is known to be dazzlingly smart . The gruff commander of U.S. and allied troops in the Persian Gulf loves classical music , speaks French and German and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated from West Point and picked up a master 's degree in guided-missile engineering from the University of Southern California . He shows a compassion and understanding of people that belie his tough demeanor . <p> He also is known to be a maverick , and that is the kind of military officer who gets snapped up on the outside , Hauser says , because his attitude is : " To hell with the rules . Just get the job done . " <p> In these early , successful days of the Persian Gulf war , the military has been riding a wave of popularity . Experts say the vivid television images of professional military officers could influence today 's top high-school and college students to enter the services . <p> " The military is likely to be the career of the ' 90s , " says William Ward , a professor of management at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove , Pa . Ward says confidence in the military hit rock bottom in the ' 70s after Vietnam but has improved since . Still , as the military produces more leaders like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire ( such ) people away , " predicts Ward . " It happened in the ' 60s , and it will happen again . " <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC The military 's new breed Patriotism , tradition and security are among the resasons people pursue military careers . One thing is certain : They do n't do it for the money .
