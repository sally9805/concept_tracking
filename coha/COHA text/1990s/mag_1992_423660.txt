Section : BOOK EXCERPT : THINK AND GROW RICH Your best business opportunities lie within yourself . <p> " What we , the colored people want , is character . And this nobody can give us . It is something we must earn for ourselves . " <p>  --  Frederick Douglass <p> <p> " Heaven helps those who help themselves " is a well-tried maxim embodying in a small compass the results of vast human experiences . Biographies of black men and women of achievement are the most instructive and useful incentives to others . Some of the best are almost equivalent to gospels  --  teaching high ambition , right thinking , and energetic action to further their aims . These valuable examples exemplify the power of integrity , self-help , individual initiative , and patient purpose . <p> Great men and women of science , literature , and the arts have belonged to no exclusive class or social rank . Some of the Master 's greatest apostles came from the ranks . The impoverished have sometimes risen to the highest stations . And the most indigent proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Douglass , the esteemed orator and ex-slave , who said , " Our destiny is largely in our own hands . If we find , we shall have to seek . If we succeed in the race for life it must be by our own energies , and our own exertions . Others may clear the road , but we must go forward or be left behind in the race for life . If we remain poor and dependent , the wealth of others will not avail us . If we are ignorant , the intelligence of others will do but little for us . If we are foolish , the wisdom of others will not guide us . If we are wasteful of our time and money , the economy of others will only make our destitution the more disgraceful . " <p> Also from the humble ranks sprang Marcus Garvey , the twentieth-century " Black Moses , " who suggested : " There is no force like success , and that is why the individual makes all efforts to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race . " <p> In both these cases , strenuous individual application was the price paid for distinction . This lesson will single out those who will embark on this same great adventure in the arena of self-reliance . <p> Who among you is not afraid to stand alone ? Who is bold , original , and resourceful ? Who is ready to strike out for his own independence ? Who is one of the audacious few who possesses the fortitude to venture where others have never been , to do what others have never done , in order to live life as others rarely will , by leaving his mark on the times through the power of self-reliance ? <p> Nine out often men past mid-life , if asked why they are only barely earning a living , would tall you that they never had a chance  --  that they were kept back , and that circumstances were against them . Chances are they would say that opportunities eluded their grasp or that they did n't have access to the proper schooling . Today , millions of young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think they have very little to do with good opportunities except to discover them . But no matter where you go , no matter what your background or educational level , your best opportunity lies within yourself . <p> The grandest fortunes ever accumulated on earth were and remain the fruit of endeavor that had no capital to begin with , save energy , intellect , and will . From L. Douglas Wilder , governor of Virginia , to John Johnson of Johnson Publishing , the story is the same , not only in the securing of wealth , but also in the seizing of greatness  --  those men and women who have won most , relied mostly upon themselves ! <p> The habit of depending on self , the determination to find one 's resources within one 's self , develops strength . Crutches were intended for the physically disabled  --  not the able-bodied . Whoever attempts to go through life on mental crutches will not go far , nor will he be successful . President Of Your Own Company <p> In the final analysis , every person is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building his own life regardless of who signs his paycheck . Within a free and open society , all of us are entrepreneurs . Each of us , individually , is the president of his or her own corporation . As you assume this office , you , and you alone , are solely responsible for your firm 's success or failure . You and the members of your family are stockholders in your corporation , and it is your responsibility to see that the value of your stock increases in the years ahead . Your family has displayed faith in you , and it is your responsibility to prove that their faith is justified . <p> While the operations of a corporation are multitudinous and complex , they can be reduced to four basic functions : finance , production , sales , and research . <p> Without proper financing , there would be no production ; without production , your company would have nothing to sell . Without sales , your corporation would have to completely stop production . And without research , your firm could not hope to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of these four vital functions and you have a crippled company  --  much like our individual braced on mental crutches . And if you slight one factor long enough , you 'll commit corporate suicide . <p> For now , let 's concentrate on research , production , and sales  --  the head , hands , and legs of your company . <p> What about research for your personal corporation ? The research of your company should be devoted to the ways and means of improving its present products or services , present production and present sales . Future research is concerned with the ways and means of developing new products and services , new Methods of production , and new methods of marketing . <p> Are you looking for new and improved ways to enhance you ? Are you presently researching the many areas in which your personal development can be effectively increased ? Lite Moves Forward <p> Time waits for no one . How many people have cheated themselves  --  thereby selling their company short  --  because they relinquished their desires or forfeited their dreams ? Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five years from today you will be five years older . The question to ask is , Will you be five years wiser ? <p> Abraham Lincoln said , " I am a slow walker , but I never look backwards . " I suggest that you never look backward . Life is a forward impulse and the past is gone . You can live only in the here and now . <p> Living in the past means clinging to nonproductive attitudes and remaining in situations that hinder your personal growth and development . Change Is Normal <p> The one constant thing in life is change . Change is everywhere in your environment , in your emotions , in your beliefs , and in the way you think . How you generate change , what you do with change , and how you react to it determine whether you grow or stagnate . In spite of the concept that change is constant , there is nevertheless a strong tendency to resist it . Why ? Because it presents an unknown factor in our lives . Though each of us may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quo rather than venture into the unknown . By sailing in supposedly " safer " waters , we isolate ourselves as much as possible from the impact of change , trying to live with problems rather than solving them . Consequently , we become experts in negative , limited thinking , almost immunizing ourselves from any possible success . <p> To participate in change is to grow . Nothing grows that does not change . The very act of lite is to experience change and growth . To earn more , you must first learn more . Those who accept and adjust to change keep growing and learning . Those who can not accommodate change do not grow . They stagnate by the wayside  --  a mental , physical , or spiritual death . <p> Why are all companies concerned with growth  --  even in a period of prosperity ? It 's because of the law that operates with companies as well as human beings . The law simply states : Nothing in the world stands still ! Nothing in the universe stands still ! A law of physics confirms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted upon by an outside force . A company that is growing has a tendency to continue to grow . In other words , it is doing things right . Conversely , a company that is shrinking has a tendency to shrink until acted upon by an outside force . That is , it will shrink until it ( or the individual ) takes in additional information ( personal development ) , or improves production and increases sales . All responsible company officials know that unless a company is growing , it is developing the first signs of stagnation or going out of business . As the head of your personal corporation , you should realize this law applies to you as well . <p> It has been estimated by scientists and scholars alike that man 's total body of knowledge doubled between 1775 and 1900 . A period of 125 years . It doubled again between 1900 and 1950 , a period of only 50 years ; and again between 1950 and 1958 ; and it is now thought to be doubling every five years . This is a tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us , as president of our own corporation , can decide what to do with our lives . We can either grow and move forward , or go backward . We can not stand still , even if that was desirable . <p> These ideas will give you an opportunity to stand back and view yourself and your future objectively , just as an intelligent bystander might . Ask yourself , how much am I worth right now , as a corporation ? If you were an outside investor , would you invest in you as a corporation ? <p> What about productivity ? A company growing at the rate of 10 percent a year will double in size in about eight years . What attention are you giving to the production of your personal corporation ? Can you grow and improve as a person at least 10 percent per year ? Of course you can . Achievers in all walks of life have multiplied their personal effectiveness ( increased productivity ) many times over . <p> We are constantly reminded of the energy being wasted , both by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-out effort does n't seem to be as popular today as it was in the past . This might explain why so few individuals rise above the ranks , and why this author believes it is so much easier to succeed today . No matter what the field , most people find it easier to stay within the warmth of the huddled masses rather than risk failure . They submerge themselves in mediocrity , ultimately suffocating at the hands of conformity . As corporate presidents , some with brilliant minds and all capable of fulfilling a specific purpose in life , they refuse to go all out , forcing their companies to teeter on the verge of liquidation . <p> But this habit can easily be overcome . Give and it shall be given to you . This simple statement grants you the ability to advance you  --  your biggest asset . By giving to others  --  of your positive attitude , your loyalty , your commitment , your faith , your winning example , and the will to win  --  by giving your talents and energies to others , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest deed you could ever perform . If it is true that life will defeat the person who lives only for himself and his own personal satisfaction , then it is equally true that the same individual will receive strength , love , happiness , and success by giving of himself or herself . Do n't Forget Sales <p> And finally , what about sales ? How can they be improved ? Sales encompass more than just selling a product or service . This is the manner in which you sell yourself to everyone with whom you come in contact . It is the way you get along with your spouse , you r children , your neighbors . <p> We are living in an age of cooperative effort . For centuries the pyramid structure was the way we organized and managed ourselves . Information , communications , and power , simulating the second law of thermodynamics , moved one way  --  from the top of the pyramid down to the bottom . However , over the years this , too , has changed . Nearly all successful companies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking  --  people talking to each other , at all different levels and in different directions , sharing id e as , information , and resources . <p> Networking exists to foster self-help , to exchange information , to change society , to improve productivity and work life , and to share resources . The important component is not the network , the finished product , but the process of getting there  --  making contacts . Within our personal universe , demographers have estimated that each of us knows nearly 270 other individuals  --  some more personally than others . This indeed may be the pathway to lead to even greater self-reliance and to the attainment of your goals . The Most Important Sale <p> How 's your level of salesmanship ? How are you marketing your most important product  --  you ? Regardless of who you are or what your chief aim is , your success will depend on your ability to sell yourself to others . <p> Selling is nothing more than the personal persuasion of ideas and thoughts . You need not go back into history to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People will be persuaded more by the depth of your conviction than by the height of your logic ; more by your enthusiasm and your belief than by any proof . Or as the master salesman Percy Whiting wrote , " Selling , to be a great art , must involve a genuine interest in the other person 's needs . Otherwise it is only a subtle , civilized way of pointing a gun and forcing one into a temporary surrender . " Self-Reliance Through Selling <p> In the modern world of business and commerce , the ability to generate sales is the indispensable prerequisite for success of all competitive enterprises . It is the effectiveness of the salesperson that determines whether companies , industries , and even countries decline or prosper . Regardless of your occupation or profession , you must be a master salesman . Salesmanship is the key to the attainment of whatever you desire from life as long as your goals do not violate God or the rights of your fellowman . <p> The major advances in all fields  --  science , education , industry , technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , by men and women who possessed and utilized the power of persuasion . Numerous variables enter into the development program of the successful salesman . Most of these are personal in nature , having a greater bearing on the salesman himself than on the product or service he offers , or the organization he represents . There are essential qualities that you must possess if you seriously intend to become a successful person . The qualities are : persistence , planning , common sense , and showmanship . <p> Pay close attention to examples that follow , and observe how these particular traits were used . If you are ready to take the first step to a more productive life , perhaps you will profit from the sales strategies of America 's top black salesmen . Persistence <p> The word " salesmanship " goes a long way toward explaining Earl Graves . In high school in Brooklyn 's Bedford-Stuyvesant section , Graves sold his relentless energy by working three jobs at once . At Morgan State he paid his way through college by working as a swim instructor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket . <p> Graves majored in economics , and by his junior year launched a business from his dorm room  --  landscaping . Graves graduated from college and entered the Army in 1958 . When he completed his tour , he went back to New York and tried his hand in real estate . <p> In his first three months he sold nine houses  --  enough to pay for a wedding and furnish a modest apartment . In 1965 , Graves went to work for the Justice Department , a job that was to eventually lead to his working for Robert Kennedy , then a New York senator . Working for Kennedy introduced Graves to a world he had never seen : a world where power was a natural heritage ; where the word ca n't did not exist , and where everybody practiced salesmanship . <p> " Working for the senator played an enormous part in my personal development , " said Graves . " Robert Kennedy was a man who was totally unfamiliar with failure . " <p> Graves recalled an incident where he was asked by the senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time , Udall was vacationing in Colorado , rafting down one of its most popular rivers . After several unsuccessful attempts to contact the secretary , Graves informed Kennedy that he was unable to reach Udall . To this the senator crisply responded , " Graves , that raft is not going down that river all day . It 's going to stop somewhere , and when it does I want Udall standing there with a phone in his hand ! " Those words still penetrate Graves 's psyche today . <p> " That story is part of my personal philosophy . You would be surprised how many people quit when faced with obstacles , As every good salesman knows , everything may not be possible today but sooner or later , it is possible . " <p> For nearly twenty years Earl Graves would apply this maxim as he and a cadre of loyal employees strove to keep BLACK ENTERPRISE magazine at the forefront of the business-monthly circulation chart . Planning <p> When the annals of black business history are written , Henry Parks and the Parks Sausage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every nickel he could scrape together , and with his most important asset  --  a knack for planning  --  Parks was one of the first black businessman to sell his product to the general market and convince the white banking establishment to invest in minority enterprises . <p> In 1951 , he did just that , and achieved what few black entrepreneurs managed to do : expand his company beyond the confines of the black consumer dollar and carve a niche within the general market . Since the Baltimore-based manufacturing company began grinding out sausage in a small converted dairy , 1990 sales have grown to more than $30 million . <p> Parks had begun his career with a blast of confidence , graduating with honors from Ohio State University . He was hired as a salesman by the Pabst Brewing Company after showing the firm a plan to market more beer among blacks . Parks 's sales strategy was to reach the general market through ethnic consumers  --  a tactic that is practiced by Fortune 500 companies today . He succeeded beyond their wildest expectations . <p> By placing salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook , chauffeur , and domestic who came to shop for their while employers , Parks infiltrated both black and white markets . To dislodge Budweiser as the exclusive supplier to America 's railroads , he befriended dining-car waiters and Pullman porters , convincing them to stock Pabst on trains , in nightclubs , hotels , and union halls . <p> In 1951 , Parks threw his sales skills into high gear and launched Parks Sausage  --  but soon ran out of money . He saw that his survival in food retailing would depend on his going beyond the minority market , so he bore straight ahead into promotion . He staged cooking demonstrations and taste tests in supermarkets  --  the first of its type . <p> Though cash was tight , Parks kept quality high and poured thousands of dollars into advertising  --  with ads like " More Parks Sausages , Mom ! " In a few short months trucks were seen rolling into some of the largest grocery chains on the East Coast , stocking the shelves in white-owned food stores . <p> " Every market has a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that key , you 'll undoubtedly capture that market . I 've proved that with proper planning , you can sell to anybody . " Common Sense <p> It would seem that a man who has amassed enough wealth to be ranked among the richest men in America  --  a personal net wealth of more than $150 million  --  would know a bit about selling . How did he do it ? " By using common sense to pry open markets . " <p> In 1942 , John H. Johnson borrowed $500 from a small loan company on the security of his mother 's furniture , and used it to start Negro Digest , a black version of Reader 's Digest The magazine started slowly due to the reluctance of local distributors who refused to stock his journal . To solve this problem , Johnson called on friends and relatives , who canvassed Chicago buying up the entire press run of the magazine . Ecstatic distributors who were unaware of Johnson 's tactics clamored for more copies . In one issue , circulation jumped from 50,000 to 150,000 copies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious and launched Ebony , a clone of Life magazine for blacks . <p> In 1973 , Johnson used the same strategy to win support for his cosmetic line . For three decades Johnson has sponsored the Ebony Fashion Fair  --  the world 's largest touring fashion show . When he had trouble finding cosmetic shades dark enough for black models , he tried unsuccessfully to convince Estee Lauder and Revlon to develop a product . When they said no , he created his own products . But it was n't that easy . His line was new , untested , and black . How could he break in ? <p> After numerous proposals to department store executives , Johnson could n't find any takers . Finally , he convinced the president of Chicago-based Marshall Field 's that his cosmetics , Fashion Fair , were worth stocking . The executive purchased a small order but warned the black tycoon that his line would be yanked if it did n't sell . Johnson had to produce . Once again common sense prevailed . Using the plan that had worked before , Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several months . Store buyers who monitored sales were excited and quick to reorder . <p> Johnson was equally quick to repeat the maneuver as he stocked the shelves of some of America 's most exclusive and acclaimed department stores . <p> " I love to sell , " Johnson states emphatically . " I sell even when there is no monetary advantage to be gained . The only advantage I have is a lifetime of experience . " John Johnson possesses a quality shared by few in his time . Common sense has its rewards , and Johnson has reaped them . Showmanship <p> Some call him a promoter , others say he is a public relations wizard  --  but neither title adequately describes what he does best . Wally Amos is a salesman who uses flair , hype , and showmanship to convey his message . With the help of an aunt , he began baking as a hobby that he would maintain throughout his promotional career . As a teenager Amos attended a Now York City trade school , with an apprenticeship at a local hotel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to graduation and joined the Air Force . After a four-year stint he returned to New York and joined the William Morris Agency , where he started in the mail room before becoming a top agent , handling such acts as Simon and Garfunkel , the Temptations , and the Supremes . Amos perfected his self-promotional skills well while passing out his chocolate chip cookies at concerts , auditions , and meetings . Friends and clients urged him to sell the treats , but he never gave the idea much thought . <p> But in 1974 , fate intervened . Amos 's personal management business was on the rocks . In a period of depression , he turned to his first love and started baking cookies full-time . After opening his first store on a shoestring , his funds waned and his cookie business went reeling . Amos recalls his toughest moment : <p> " As I look back , I realize that I was grossly undercapitalized . But I was too naive to consider failure . With no money , I had to stir up my creative juices and promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Amos wrote a business plan , raised some start-up capital from his show business contacts , and took a leap of faith . A few months later , amid flowing champagne , a strolling band , valet parking , and 1,500 people , Wally Amos set his chocolate chips above all others  --  he called them " Famous Amos Chocolate chip cookies . " <p> Starved for cash , he once traded a day 's worth of cookies ( $750 ) for advertising time on local radio . He had professional models distribute cookies to passersby in neighboring Beverly Hills and Hollywood . " I knew I had the best product . All I needed to do was to convince the public of something I already knew . In 1975 , a star was born and I was its showman . " <p> Carefully consider these four qualities . Question yourself about the characteristics you honestly possess and those in which you are deficient . Work at improving your persistence , planning , common sense , and showmanship . Master salesmanship is an art and a valuable tool for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprises are managed by leaders who either knowingly or unconsciously apply the ideas described in this chapter . You too can become a recognized leader in the field of your choice by utilizing these principles  --  finance , production , research , and sales  --  in your life . Self-Help <p> There are no open doors to the temple of success . Everyone who enters must forge his own way . Grand success waits patiently for anyone who has the fortitude and determination to seize his share of the American dream . But you must remember that it is you who creates your opportunities  --  not fate , luck , or chance . <p> Life is a lesson , a nd every lesson , regardless of where or when it occurs , is opportunity . Every business transaction is opportunity . Where there are people , there is opportunity . <p> In truth , opportunity first takes shape in your mind . It is an expression of how you perceive yourself as well as how you perceive your environment . The achievers , the innovators , and the movers and shakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yes , I can ! There is a way  --  and I 'll find it ! " <p> They are those rare individuals who accept life with its challenges and who work to turn those challenges into successes . <p> Opportunities abound ! YOU ARE OPPORTUNITY and you must knock on the door leading to your destiny . You create opportunity as you turn your crises and defeats into success . <p> Self-help is the offspring of adversity , the progeny of defeat . The spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in the individual . If you rely on others for help , you lose the stimulus to improve yourself , which in effect renders you comparatively helpless . Put forth the effort , and practically anything you desire is yours . When opportunity is seized , self-help is simultaneously activated . The path to greatness and success is paved with self-reliance . Do n't Wait For Opportunity ! <p> Do n't wait for opportunity  --  make it ! Make it as Thomas Burrell made his when he first conceived and created Burrell Advertising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised by his mother in a tough section on Chicago 's South Side . Though he barely managed to stay out of trouble , he scored well on a scholastic aptitude test that would eventually give his life new meaning . With a newfound direction , his aim , attitude , and academic performance improved , leading him to college , where he majored in English and advertising . <p> Prior to graduation Burrell landed a job with a Chicago ad agency , working in the mail room for less than fifty dollars a week . It was here that Burrell made his opportunity ! Within three months he advanced to copywriter , then on to various television and print campaigns . Burrell mastered his trade well , sharpening his skills with every new assignment . But when he launched his own agency , he wondered if he had made a serious mistake . lt took six nervous months before his shaky firm secured its first account . As time wore on , Burrell pushed his fear aside and performed admirably . <p> Today , with more than $50 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Procter &; Gamble , and McDonald 's , Burrell Advertising is the fastest growing black-owned advertising agency in the U.S. <p> Make your opportunity as Percy Sutton made his , by utilizing his many talents . lt was in 1964 , during the Harlem riots , that Sutton quelled a hostile crowd by using a local radio talk show as a forum for peace . Impressed by his performance , the station owner offered Sutton the chance to purchase one of his New York stations . But Sutton was nearly broke . Eight years later he organized a consortium of 33 investors , some of who used their homes as collateral to obtain bank loans to purchase the $2.1 million station . Since then Sutton 's company , Inner City Broadcasting , has diversified into a variety of fields . The parent company , which now has more than sixty stockholders , operates a cable station , New York 's Apollo Theatre , and a number of profitable radio stations nationwide . <p> Make your opportunity as Alice Walker made hers . As the youngest of eight children , Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her parents ' annual income  --  her father was a sharecropper , her mother a maid  --  never exceeded $5,000 . Nevertheless , she still unearthed the secret to success by clinching a rare place in literary history . In 1983 , she became the first black female novelist to win the coveted Pulitzer Prize for fiction for her masterpiece The Color Purple . <p> Make your opportunity as Carl Rowan made his . Carl Rowan and his family knew the kind of poverty that is thankfully rare today . He was raised in a rat-infested home in rural Tennessee that had neither a clock , electricity , running water , telephone , or radio . His family survived on black-eyed peas and navy beans . But out of this milieu emerged a black child who would go on to become a naval officer , a member of the Foreign Service during the Kennedy administration , and , arguably , Black America 's most successful syndicated columnist At every step along the way he challenged mediocrity and complacency . Though racism and poverty tried desperately to put him on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Brown , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , made his . Brown discovered the genius that slept dormant within . As a freshman at Middlebury College , he confronted the racial restrictions of an all-white fraternity . Poised , talented , and competent , he refused to offer the organization any reason to deny his acceptance except skincolor  --  something the fraternity was unwilling to do . Thirty years later he placed the Democratic party leadership in the same position . <p> The achievement of Ron Brown , as well as those mentioned above , is due , in large measure , to their ability to digest and apply the central rule of success : Do n't wait for opportunity  --  make it ! <p> The call of the twentieth century is for those who will climb into the rare air described by all who have ascended to a greater self-reliance . There is no corner of the market that is not seeking young men and women of ability , who will help themselves by relying on their own splendid talents . <p> There is some one thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Search until you find your area of excellence , and organize all of your forces and attack it with the belief that you are going to excel . Keep in mind , the man who complains he never had a chance probably has n't the courage to take a chance . And the man who says it ca n't be done is busy getting out of the way of the man doing it . He who attempts the impossible has little competition . Make your opportunity as all who 've embraced riches have done  --  by seizing it ! <p> Self-reliance is not a question of what someone can do on your behalf , but what you can do for yourself . And you can do whatever you decide to do . You do n't have to work , pay taxes , have children , or even get out of bed in the morning  --  millions do n't . You decide to do whatever you wish because it is profitable to you , and whatever you choose to do is the best choice among the alternatives available to aid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do or not to do , it is equipped with the added requirement of responsibility . Tough words ? l agree , but totally necessary if you are to experience the true riches of life . <p> PHOTO : Book : THINK AND GROW RICH ; A Black Choice <p> By DENNIS KIMBRO and NAPOLEON HILL <p> <p> Excerpted from the book Think And Grow Rich : A Black Choice by Dennis Kimbro and Napoleon Hill . <p>
