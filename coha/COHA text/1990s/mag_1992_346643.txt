The trip from the new Spain to the old is but a five-minute stroll across a gleaming white bridge that spans the Guadalquivir River in Seville . On one / side , near the monastery where Christopher Columbus was once buried , rise the extravagant pavilions of the Universal Exposition . There , 250 fountains gurgle , 325,000 newly planted trees and shrubs shade the weary , and 96 restaurants replenish the hungry . But once over the bridge , sidewalks crumble and the highway dead-ends in a stinking garbage dump known as El Vacie . Within earshot of Expo 92 's loudspeakers , 500 Sevillians elbow one another for their daily water ration from a small fountain . <P> The soaring $75 million Alamillo Bridge , part of $10 billion invested in the fair and new transportation facilities , is an inspired architectural monument . But to those who live in El Vacie 's shacks , cubist contraptions of plywood and cardboard , it is an affront . After years of delay , the government only last week began to install 36 flimsy prefabricated homes  --  far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 families , who live without toilets or running water and cook on open fires . " The rats are eating us ! " complains Alvarina Roza Jimenez , mother of eight , holding up her daughter 's hand to show a scar . The seven-year-old is barefoot , filthy , with sores on her mouth . <P> El Vacie differs little from other squatter settlements in Andalusia , where an estimated 44,000 Spaniards , many of them Gypsies , live in poverty . But Expo 's construction introduced a new level of envy and conflict . Additional squatters whose homes were bulldozed for the fair moved in , swelling the waiting list for El Vacie 's promised houses . At the fountain , a fistfight broke out between women jostling for water , and one was admitted to the hospital with a broken leg . " Expo is a disaster for the poor , " says Miguel Angel Moreno , a local Human Rights Association volunteer . " It drained money from social programs and doubled our cost of living . " <P> Two decades ago , the slum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , dismissed as Europe 's Third World backwater , shook off its authoritarian past and propelled itself into relative prosperity . As much as the quincentenary of its " encounter " with America , this country of 39 million is celebrating  --  with justifiable swagger  --  its breakneck pace of change since General Francisco Franco 's death in 1975 . Moreover , 1992 marks 10 years of stable democracy under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez , a pragmatic Socialist . And it coincides with Spain 's integration into the European single market , a source of pride after decades of diplomatic isolation . This year 's bold gamble of staging a world 's fair and an Olympics will " show the world the image of a modern Spain , far from the cliches of the past , " says Virgilio Zapatero , the Cabinet Minister in charge of Expo .
