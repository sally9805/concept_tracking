My kids made their choice clear from the very start-it 's mom-made school lunches or nothing . So , with two children currently entering grades 2 and 4 , I see a long road of morning lunch-box packing ahead of me . Yet , I must admit , I 'm glad my young vegetarian sons have opted for homemade meals-that way the food choices are ours rather than those of a cafeteria food concession . Still , there are many days when the prospect of making lunch before our 8:15 a.m. bolt to the bus stop is a daunting one indeed . My need for nutritious lunchbox ideas with kid appeal is constant . While peanut butter and jam is always a good option , it can get pretty boring after a while . I find the key to successful school lunches is variety . But as any parent or caregiver knows , what 's bliss to one child may be unacceptable ( a polite way of saying " yucky ! " ) to another . I ca n't give the lunch I made for my son with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where a list of options-one that can be tacked up in a convenient location in your kitchen-comes in handy ( see Main Event Options , p.50 ) . Another lunch-making strategy I employ is a weekly plan . This helps avoid the morning panic of what to make Lunch Box Tips &; Tricks Keep your lunch-making supplies together in one place to make the preparation process more efficient during morning " rush hour . " Store the lunch bags and boxes , sandwich bags , thermoses , plastic spoons and forks , toothpicks and small plastic storage containers in the same area . Put flat dry-ice containers in your child 's lunch box during warm weather , or any time you are sending perishable foods , such as dairy products or egg dishes . These are available wherever lunch boxes or camping supplies are sold . Photograph // Vary the types of bread you use for sandwiches . Bagels , rolls , pita pockets , English muffins , raisin bread and flour tortillas or " wraps , " can add interest to standard sandwich fare . I 've not had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain that they are not warm enough by the time they get to eat them . Consider filling thermoses with dishes that taste just as good at room temperature , such as noodle puddings or rice pudding ( see recipe for Vanilla Rice Pudding , p. 53 ) . If your child 's school has a microwave oven available , as did ny younger son 's preschool , your thermos offerings can expand to include macaroni and cheese , soups and leftover casseroles . The fruit I packed into lunch boxes would often come back uneaten until I resorted to these simple tricks : placing small chunks of fruit , such as strawberries , grapes , melon and tiny seedless orange sections on a wooden skewer or long cocktail toothpick and bagging apple slices with a tiny container of peanut butter for dipping . Raw vegetables also become more of a draw when you supply a dip . When sending carrot sticks ( or baby carrots ) , celery or bell pepper strips add a small container of natural , low-fat ranch or Thousand Island dressing . For very young children- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun shapes with a cookie cutter . Main Event Options Cereal is standard breakfast fare , but it 's an unexpected treat when served for lunch . Pack some nutritious cereal in a lidded bowl-shaped container , and your child can add milk or soy milk to it when it 's time to eat . Teamed with a banana , this makes a filling meal . Hearty muffins-homemade or storebought-can be a welcome change of pace from sandwiches . Pack a wedge of cheese or a container of yogurt ( or their soy alternatives ) and some fresh fruit to go along with it . Salads in pita bread appeal to kids with more adventurous palates . Augment these salads with chickpeas , chunks of baked marinated tofu or grated cheese . Keep pita sandwiches fresh by wrapping first in foil then in sandwich bags . For warm weather , a container of yogurt and fruit salad and a roll ( with butter , fruit spread , cream cheese or peanut butter ) is a refreshing option . The yogurt and fruit salad can be eaten separately , or you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit salad . Expand your PBJ horizons by exploring other nut butters ( such as cashew or almond ) and no-sugar-added fruit spreads or apple butter . Soy-based faux meats can be a boon to lunch-box variety . Try the phony baloney products ( or the fake bacon in a classic " BLT " combination ) . Soy deli slices or " pepperoni " on sub rolls might especially appeal to teens ( see recipe for Soy Deli Heroes , p. 52 ) . " Chicken- " or " turkey- " style soy slices on soft whole grain bread appeal to tastes of any age . Baked marinated tofu can be served sliced on bread or mashed and served in a pita . Pasta salad is an appealing lunch option . Use fun shapes , such as wagon wheels , small shells or tiny tubes . Small shapes pack best into containers . Add your child 's favorite veggies-mine like steamed broccoli , black olives and carrots . and also ensures that I have the basic ingredients on hand .
