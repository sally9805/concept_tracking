According to Autry , creating a sense of community-where both employer and employee care about what they do and find a balance between work and life-is the key to producing workplaces with purpose and profits . It 's through this understanding of work relationships that those who might not " necessarily like one another . . . come together for the common good . " Autry is a poet , former president of the magazine group of the Meredith Corporation , and author of the influential management guide , Love and Profit : The Art of Caring Leadership ( Avon , 1992 ) , and his most recent , Life and Work : A Manager 's Search for Meaning ( Morrow , 1994 ) . Autry is also the author of Nights Under a Tin Roof . . . Recollections of a Southern Boyhood ( Yoknapatawpha , 1983 ) and Life After Mississippi ( Yoknapatawpha , 1989 ) . What brought you to examine the spiritual side of work ? People who work together-whether they produce magazines , sell real estate , manufacture parts for automobiles , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and this is the spirit of work that you might call spirituality . It 's the human spirit . Exploring this area began as an intellectual matter that came out of my work as a poet . I began writing poems that reflected my Southern upbringing and farm life . And as I pondered the integration between work and life in rural America , I started thinking about what was lost in the corporate world . Everything in corporate America was work , work , work , without regard to relationships . But you were right in the midst of this corporate world ? Right . In the 1970s I began to get into senior management positions and noticed that in these management positions there existed an obvious dichotomy between the way people thought they were supposed to act versus the way they really wanted to-once you got to be a boss , you had to avoid personal contact with your employees . But over the years , my work experience had taught me that people know what to do . And I realized that what I needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources that they needed , and then the company would prosper . Yet , there was all this superstructure-all the strategic planning and goal setting . And I realized that those on top are scared that they 're going to lose control-although that control is pretty much an illusion . But this imperative toward being in control within a traditional hierarchical structure formalized communications among people and the way they perceived themselves . As a senior manager , one of the first things I did was do away with organizational charts because they do n't really depict how either authority or information flows . There was a structural and human part of the business , and I wanted to emphasize the human . I deliberately stopped concentrating on anything that was particularly procedural or policy driven . Even now as a management consultant , I really try to concentrate on building a working community of people who care about what they do , who have the opportunity for spiritual , personal , and psychological growth as well as financial and professional growth , who try to find the balance within their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers , try to help the employees find that balance for themselves . This is what makes a more productive workplace . That 's my whole mission . As a manager , how else did you go about breaking the traditional model of the workplace ? At one time I had to develop new products-new magazines . The appropriate organizational model would be to set up a department that develops new products . And what would these new department people be operating out of ? Fear . If they do n't come up with new ideas , then they 're not going to have a job . So I said to the magazine group : " Anybody who wants to volunteer to work on a committee to create new magazines , please volunteer . However , you 've got to do it on your own time and there 's no extra money in it . But if we start up one of the magazines you 're championing , you 'll get to be on that staff . " We ended up going from four successful magazines to 17 , several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living , Wood , Traditional Home , and others . Let me give you another example . I consulted for five years for a media company in Sydney , Australia . They had a lot of communication problems-gossip , competition , backstabbing . The CEO there recognized the power of 12-step programs and the honesty participants are able to achieve with one another . But how can that be done in a business ? First , understand that you ca n't nurture healthy relationships only talking about budgets , planning , operations , and logistics . I established a series of meetings in which we all had to sit in a circle with nothing in front of us-no agenda , no writing materials , no chairperson . I started off the meeting by telling the group that we were only going to talk about how we feel about either one another , the work that we do , our lives , or anything else that comes to mind . And I made sure that a representative of top management came in and told everyone that this was an utterly safe place-there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO himself participated . Eventually people started talking . And I was able to move to a more intense line of conversation with questions such as , What do you really love about your job ? What 's the one thing you would change about your job ? And what 's the benefit of this group sharing ? Inevitably , there 's a breakthrough . It 's never failed . Somebody says something that 's intensely emotional , and all of a sudden it clicks . It clears the communication so that business goes on without that shadow of prejudice and hostility that exists between some co-workers . I 'm no visionary . There are a lot of people doing what I do . But until it gets into the business-world literature-until Harvard 's business school acknowledges it-it does n't get talked about by most of the people in management positions . Does everybody in a company have to love one another ? I do n't even think people have to like one another . But when you 're at work , you have to care about one another and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all of you . And that caring is an act that is transcendent of personality . On the other hand , when push comes to shove-companies do n't seem to care about the workers-they 'll downsize for the sake of the bottom line . That is the heart of the great debate going on in the country today . Downsizing is a really terrible situation . It does n't happen to involve a very high percentage of the workforce , but it gets a high percentage of the headlines . We 're headed for a lot of trouble because many of these layoffs are just shortsided and stupid and completely without historical reference-not to mention without concern for the people involved . Where is a lot of this downsizing coming from ? Most people have a pension plan , which is in turn being managed by a fund manager . And that fund manager holds billions of dollars in pension plans . In fact , a very high percentage of publicly owned American companies are owned by very large institutional investors . The institutional investors represent the funds that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American workers . Now what are the pressures for these fund managers ? They have X millions of dollars in pensions to pay out every year now , and they 've got to build the principal of the fund so that when the great baby-boomer rush begins to retire , they 'll have enough money in those funds to pay out those pensions . They need the money flowing in to service the pensions today , and they need to grow the money to be able to service the pensions tomorrow . It used to be that we were only focused on stock price and the return on shareholder equity . The center of gravity of the stock market has shifted from a lot of people owning stock to millions owning stock through pension funds-which puts all the power in a few fund managers ' hands . So what do they do ? They buy stocks when they run up and sell stocks when they begin to turn down . They do not invest for the long term in companies . They go for who is making the biggest gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about a certain stock , the investors follow through . Back in the 1980s , boards of corporations were less responsive to the stockholders . But then these boards started to participate in the governance of the organization , and they said , " If we 're going to be responsible to the stockholders , we 're not going to pay the CEO with just a salary and bonuses but in stock options . " So the entire compensation structure of corporate CEOs shifted from pay and bonuses to pay and options . When you hear about a CEO who made $40 million last year , he or she did n't make $40 million in salary but $1 million in salary and $39 million in gains on stock options , which he or she may or may not have cashed . If the stock options are the reward and you 're the CEO , what you want to do is produce higher stock prices . What happens ? Well , AT &T; says , " We 're going to lay off 40,000 workers . We 're restructuring . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . The assumption is that if you 're going to lay off all these people , it 's going to save a lot of money ; therefore , it 's going to put more money on the bottom line . But how can people be so well educated yet such simpletons ? If I were to lay off 10,000 people , am I just saying , " You 're fired " ? No . I 'm giving out severance packages or early retirements . I 'm going to have to take a hit if I lay off 10,000 people of maybe $5 to $6 million or more . But do the stock-market people look at that and say , " That 's going to hurt their earnings " ? No . They say , " Well , that 's just a one-time hit . They 'll get past that . " And the stock goes up . A professor at the University of Denver has begun to track companies that have undergone massive layoffs to look at their market value and earnings . And he is finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors . It 's a mess right now . Our greatest enemy is the CEO who cares only that the company perform during his or her tenure . But I think the rumblings on the labor side and among the workers are going to either produce legislation or change attitudes . Companies gripe , gripe , gripe about the government , and yet they do n't do what they should do . What should they do ? A lot of small businesses gripe about affirmative action . But we got affirmative-action legislation because businesses did n't do what they should have morally and ethically done in the first place . Now we are laying people off , creating this tremendous disruption , and running up the cost of welfare and saying , " Oh , gosh , do n't pass legislation that would take away our free market flexibility . " We 've got to create a workplace of support and not fear . That 's got to be our new covenant . We need to create a situation in which we trust the people and are honest with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what farmers had . Can you imagine a farmer coming in from the field and his spouse saying , " Honey , we need to talk . Your work is interfering with our relationship " ? Work , life , and relationship are so inextricably intertwined in that context that there is not a dichotomy of values . But we do things in business that we 'd never do at home , with our friends , in our neighborhood , or at our church . Now do n't get me wrong , survival has to be the number one goal of an organization , but not survival at any cost . The real disasters occur in companies that are making record profits and at the same time laying people off to make the stockholder value go up . People can understand layoffs in order to survive  --  they may not like it , but they can understand it . What we ca n't understand is the company making record profits , laying off thousands of people , and the top people walking off with millions of dollars in stock options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate culture ? The corporate culture does not derive from the top person alone but from everyone . The top person sets a certain tone , but there 's a whole culture that exists outside of the structure , and everyone is a part of it . I never buy that argument of " I can be a despicable person because if I 'm not , the company will get somebody else who will be an even more despicable person than I am . " The question is , Are you going to choose to be a despicable person ? You have a moral responsibility , and you ca n't hide behind and blame your actions on the institution . Should companies work to avoid layoffs ? Avoiding layoffs is a noble thing . But you 've also got to manage your business in order to succeed at what you 're doing . Your goal is not to avoid laying off people-it 's to create products that work and that will provide employment . I think layoffs can be done in a way that is reflective of our values , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be done with an emphasis on people and their family needs , not on the stockholder value . Take for example the recent AT &T; layoffs . They went about it all wrong . You should n't announce layoffs to the press first , so that the stock will go up , and then let everybody wait for six months , not knowing whether they 're going to get a pink slip or not . You owe it to your employees to act as soon as possible . Let me tell you about a company I consulted for in Colorado-a magazine and media company . They had a magazine that was losing money and was simply not going to make it . We had to lay off a lot of people as a result of the decision to fold the publication . So here 's what we did . We told the people that they were going to be laid off . We worked out severance packages . We set up an active job search for people . We set up an interest-free loan fund from which people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one was going to end up in financial disaster . We told everyone that we hated to do this , but the whole company was going to sink if we did n't . And we emphasized that we cared about the welfare of all the employees and that we were going to make it as easy as possible . Companies are such secret keepers . People need to come right out and say , " Look , here 's what I think is going to happen if we do n't do this , here 's why we 're doing it , and here 's what we 're going to do to try to mitigate and make it easy on people . " This is how you must relate to people . What 's the best model for understanding work relationships ? It 's very easy to fall into this big happy family syndrome , but I do n't buy that as a model for companies . I do n't even like teams . What do teams do ? They compete . They win . They lose . And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A leader 's great task is to make people 's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant . In corporations , we like to say , " All my people are outstanding . " Well , that 's nonsense . If you really think of the workplace as a community , you know that people have strengths and weaknesses . In a community , people do n't necessarily like one another , but they do come together for the common good . But the fact is , you have to purge people from that community when they are n't doing what they need to do for their share of the common good . My biggest complaint about managers is n't that they have to fire people , it 's that they do n't fire people . They tolerate incompetence and bad performance without honestly telling an employee , " You 're not doing what you should be . " Managers may feel that they have done the ethical thing because they did n't fire someone . But they 've done a much less moral thing by imposing that person 's incompetence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that employee a chance to redeem him or herself . We live in a both-and world . If I 'm a manager and I have an employee who has a child with a problem , do I approach that with understanding as a parent myself ? Or do I approach that as a boss who has to get the work done ? The answer is both . I 've got to be supportive and compassionate , and I 've got to get the work done . That 's the paradox of management . You have to care about people , support people , be a resource for people , and you have to fire people . Sometimes it 's the same people . If you ca n't deal with that , believe me , do n't get into management . Why would a manager be fearful of getting rid of incompetent workers ? It 's easy to be honest with people if you 're passing out compliments . But criticism , that 's where the courage comes in . Managers usually respond by being tough and yelling at people . Intimidation-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how loud you raise your voice , how hard you hit the desk . This whole lack of honest communication stems from fear . We all want to be liked . But if you take issues of control and ego , you 've defined the two obstacles to good leadership . Do most people have the ability to manage ? We do n't train people for management . And that happens for any number of reasons . For example , certain people are promoted through a company and they do n't know anything about managing a staff . We 've also set up systems in which the way you get ahead is by bossing people around . But that 's beginning to change-the way you get ahead now is when your group , or team , succeeds . But with change , misconceptions occur . When companies try to become less structured , they often think that means take the harnesses off people and let them run free-but they may just run in circles . We were brought up with the idea of an allpowerful , parent-God who hands down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're punished . We then transferred this thinking into our families and workplaces . Now suddenly , companies say , " Okay , we do n't have these rules anymore . You 're going to manage yourselves , and we 're going to agree on the goals of our company . Now , go to it . " But just as it takes training to teach managers to lead , it takes training to teach people to accept accountability and responsibility . How can managers help people who are no longer challenged by their work ? By job renewal-not telling someone to go out and get a new job but renewing what they 're already doing . That may mean giving them different or special assignments or suggesting that they take courses . Encourage them to go back to a university and take a course in poetry or a foreign language . It 's worth the company 's while because an employee 's growth depends on learning and expanding the horizons beyond what he or she is doing every day . I developed Project Horizons for my company . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of speakers-a professor of Shakespeare , artists , photographers , business leaders , philosophers-or conduct a film series . It 's important to feed people 's senses , to feed the intellect and inner spirit , so I did that institutionally . Information is the single most nurturing thing in any organization . Nobody ever did a bad job after having too much information . What about those who look at work as drudgery ? I think it 's up to you individually to find meaning in what you do . If , however , you 're under intense pressure because of what I 'm doing as a manager to you and your job conditions , I have robbed you of the opportunity to find that meaning and that spiritual growth . I do n't think the type of work is the problem . It 's the opportunity and environment management provides and what you bring to your workplace . What kind of company would Jesus run ? Well , naturally Jesus could n't be the CEO-he did n't have the training or the qualifications ! But seriously , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employees , stockholders , customers , and vendors . He would practice community outreach by budgeting a percentage of pre-tax profits for education and charity . Customers would get the best fair and equitable treatment on pricing and service . And the community would benefit from the presence of the corporation , not just in providing jobs , but in giving back to the social and economic infrastructure through charity and education . A CEO who was Christ-like-and I believe some CEOs are-would be not only sensitive to the moral obligations to stockholders but also other constituencies , such as education , social services , and the government . That CEO would provide for the kind of special treatment that workers need : family leave , child care , elder care , day care , job sharing , work at home . I do n't think these CEOs would necessarily refer to themselves as Christ-like . This environment would not be overtly religious , but overtly moral , fair , compassionate , considerate , and responsive . Is n't making a profit enough of a social responsibility-providing people with jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company is the product of a complex infrastructure-economic , social , political , and moral . The public schools and the educational institutions , the health-care system , the social-services system , and the government all have a part in the success of corporations . Corporate leaders scream about getting the government out of their lives , but if the government got out , most of them would go bankrupt . Our system thrives because business is the engine for creating fair and equitable opportunities for economic growth . We 're built on economic opportunities for individuals-that 's the heart of America . But business left to its own devices would not do it-that would lead to an economic dictatorship . Do you think it 's wrong to work in certain industries , such as a tobacco or nuclear bomb plant ? People who work in these industries are certainly not immoral or unethical . These workplaces exist as communities as well . The question is , What are you as a consumer going to accept ? Are you going to accept that producing nuclear weapons is keeping the peace on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning because of the product produced-sorry , I do n't go for that . To say , " Well , I 'm not responsible because I do n't put my name on those products " or " I 'm not responsible because I do n't work on producing these products " is wrong . We 're all responsible . Every time you buy a gallon of gas , a cup of coffee , a piece of clothing that may have been made in a sweatshop , then you 're responsible . I do n't wear my Christianity on my sleeve . But I do n't think I can be a Christian without saying , " I 'm responsible . " And that means in the way I vote and the products I buy . I endorse boycotts . What I do n't endorse is judging other people that 's dehumanizing and says that these people are n't capable of moral interaction , human connection , community , or manifesting spirituality . Are there some common values that the majority of Americans work for ? By far , the majority of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards that are consistent with the work . Everybody has the same human worth . But not every job has the same value to the enterprise . Jobs that require more training , education , and are greater in demand are worth more money because of their value to the enterprise . But that does n't mean that the people who hold those jobs are deserving of more dignity or respect . What are your own goals for your work ? If I have a goal for the rest of my productive working life , it 's to try to play some part in the transformation of business-a transformation that expresses the best of who humans can be rather than as a technical money-machine enterprise . But we have to keep in mind that the money is important . Work is about both producing income and contributing to the social economic system . A CEO , a wonderful man , used to say , " We do n't talk about profit here . Profit is like breathing . We talk about what we do to keep the body healthy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make the profit . <p>
