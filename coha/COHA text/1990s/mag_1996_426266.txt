It 's been a long time since smoking was as romantic as Paul Henreid made it in Now , Voyager . But even to an industry that 's been fighting liability suits since 1954 , the current wave of tobacco bashing feels unusually ferocious . On March 13 , jaws dropped when Bennett LeBow , who controls the cigarette maker Liggett Group and who also happens to be vying for control of tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco , offered to settle some claims for smoking-related damages . Though LeBow 's proposed settlement amounts to a modest $31 million , to be paid over 25 years , it was the first time anyone in the industry had settled anything . Investors , fearing that the offer is a harbinger of things to come , dumped tobacco shares . The stocks tumbled further on March 18 , when three former Philip Morris employees alleged that tobacco companies manipulated nicotine levels . Together , the blows knocked tobacco stocks down by more than 10% , costing shareholders some $15 billion . Does this recent downturn spell an opportunity , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periodic steep drops have usually proved to be fertile buying opportunities . Consider : Though litigation scares have threatened tobacco companies on and off for a decade , Philip Morris has produced an annualized return of 29% over that period . But to many professionals , the threats this time around feel more ominous . Says Philip Schettewi , who manages $4 billion for Loomis Sayles : " With the recent testimony , the class actions , the Medicaid problem , the proposed Liggett settlement-there 's a big cloud over these companies , and it wo n't blow away tomorrow . " // SIGNALS // Others are less willing to spin doom scenarios or put a number on just how bad liabilities could get , if in fact any judgments against the industry will be awarded at all . When pressed to quantify the litigation risk , Art Cecil , who has followed the industry for T Rowe Price for 15 years , says , " You can use any number you want , from zero on up-though at this point I 'm not expecting long-term damage . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for queasy investors . Setbacks could easily occur as more states file suit against the industry for reimbursement of Medicaid costs . But even so , for investors with patience-and nerves of steel-the slump in tobacco shares may offer a rare opportunity to pick up some terrific profit generators on the cheap . Philip Morris will make an estimated $71.5 billion in revenue this year , and $12.8 billion in operating income . Nancy Tengler , a portfolio manager for UBS Asset Management in San Francisco and a tobacco bull , points out that the industry has yet to lose a case in court ; that many of the allegations remain difficult to prove ; and that focus groups point to the fact that juries ultimately conclude that smokers are fully aware of the risks they take . Any good news-a decertification of a class-action suit , for instance-could lead to an instant spike in shares . Another important factor is the loyalty of core smokers , particularly overseas . Twentyfive percent of Americans smoke-a number that is unlikely to get much lower-even though the antismoking climate is the strongest it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less and the risk of litigation is not a factor , smoking rates are much higher . What 's more , Philip Morris and RJR are gaining market share in international markets with American-blend brands like Marlboro and Winston . Tengler estimates that for Philip Morris , international tobacco operations account for 32% of the company 's total revenue ; domestic accounts for 17% . She figures the recent 17% decline in the share price has already fully discounted the entire domestic tobacco operation . // S &P; TOBACCO INDEX // The smaller companies also offer solid numbers . Loews , with nearly $14 billion in revenue , earns most of its money from insurance , but its Lorillard Tobacco subsidiary-featuring Newport and Kent-generates ample cash flow . Shares nearly doubled last year but spilled along with the others in the recent selloff . UST , which generates $1.3 billion in revenue , is the leading maker of smokeless-tobacco products like Skoal . Recently the stock has lagged too , but it faces less litigation risk than the others . Ivesters must mind the balance between fear and greed : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse , the current problems could mushroom . But for those willing to gut it out , the stocks offer a tempting contrarian play-not many have lost betting on Philip Morris in the past . The thorny dilemmas , however , are enough to send investors groping for a smoke . <p>
