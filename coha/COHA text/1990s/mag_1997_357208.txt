I mean to defend the minivan , for it is much maligned . It is not universally maligned , of course . I know of many women in particular who find the minivan the perfect vehicle for its intended purpose , which is the safe and efficient conveyance of half a dozen belligerent , sputtering children from home to soccer game to swim lesson to juvenile-detention center , where most of them belong . The people who malign the minivan  --  if the gender police will grant me this small observation  --  are almost exclusively men . And they are at last having their way . Sales of minivans are flat this year , while sales of larger sport-utility vehicles soar . As a commercial product , minivans may not be in crisis , but their troubles reflect the troubles of the American male , who is . <P> In middle-class and upper-middle-class homes the following scenario is played out daily . Wife and Husband have decided to buy a new family car , their last one having been rendered immobile by the accumulated weight of gum wads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Happy Meals . Do they go with the stolid minivan or the racy sport-ute ? They consult consumer guides . They compare prices . They make , if they have the stomach for it , a few desultory visits to a variety of reptilian car salesmen . And they gather promotional brochures . <P> The brochures for the minivans are bogus at first glance . Here is a Windstar  --  or is it a Previa ? a Caravan ?  --  parked in the circular drive of an Alpine castle , glistening after a spring shower . The image is idiotic : American marketing at its most cynical . But Husband lingers over the sport-utility brochures . The pages are heavy and slick , almost sensuous , like the leaves of some edible exotic plant . And the pictures ! They are familiar to him from the thousands of commercials he saw during the N.B.A. finals . The Jeep Cherokee roars up the perilous incline of a desert mountain . Fearlessly the Land Rover grinds its way deep into a rain forest . A Dodge Durango perches at the very lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wusses . These sport-utility vehicles are rugged , invincible , built for the strenuous
