In all the years he went to school , while growing up in Houston , no course of study left a more vivid impression on Raul Marquez than the class his father used to convene on the couch in the family living room . It was there , in front of the 25-inch color television set , that Arturo Marquez conducted an intensive course of applied science  --  of applied sweet science , that is , Marvin Hagler-style. // The elder Marquez would run videotapes of Hagler 's fights when Hagler was the undisputed middleweight champion of the world and presided over the division like a bald-headed Zeus , throwing bolts of lightning from either side to paralyzing effect . " Look at the way he moves , " Arturo would lecture his son . " See how he throws the right jab , then takes one step right and throws the left . Pow ! He uses both hands , Raul ! Jabs , hooks , uppercuts . Look at the body punches ! He does everything . He is beautiful ! " // As a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from countryman Salvador Sanchez to Roberto Duran . But it was Hagler , who fought southpaw , that he held up as a model to his lefthanded son . " Everything I taught Raul , I learned from Marvin Hagler , " says Arturo . // The boy learned well . Two weeks ago , on his way to winning the 156-pound division at the Olympic Boxing Trials in Worcester , Mass. , the 20-year-old Marquez stunned Robert Allen in the quarterfinals with a withering , two-handed body attack , setting him up for jarring shots to the head that had Allen out on his feet when the referee stopped the fight in the third round . Marquez 's performance was notable for the power of the punching and the savagery of the attack . Last Friday in Phoenix , at the Olympic Box-off , the final step in the elimination process to determine the U.S. team , a wildly over-zealous Marquez jabbed , hooked and banged his way to a 78-13 decision over Antwun Echols to earn a place on the 12-man squad heading for Barcelona . // While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most landed by a boxer in the 13 bouts over three days  --  and this despite fighting with an elbow still so sore from the Allen bout that he could not throw a straight left hand  --  Echols 's 43 were the most hits scored by a losing fighter . Indeed , at times the bout looked like something you might see after last call in a biker bar . // At one point , trying desperately to knock Echols out , Marquez missed with a hook thrown so hard that he spun 180 degrees and crashed to the deck . Throughout the fight he repeatedly put himself at risk against a puncher he was beating easily on points . // " Pride , " said Marquez by way of explanation . " He was slugging me . I was slugging him back . " // Roger Bloodworth , one of Marquez 's advisers , rolled his eyes at that . " You fight with your brain , not your pride , " said Bloodworth. // The taking of risks may also have been learned from the father . Arturo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago Heights , Ill. , where he lived as an illegal alien , off and on , while working to save money to start and then support a family . He was the second of 10 children born to a farming family in Valle Hermoso , a dot on the map of northern Mexico , and as a young man he studied to be a machinist . Like many Mexicans , he looked across the Rio Grande for his future . In 1969 , trying to raise enough money to marry his childhood sweetheart , he set out for Chicago with only the clothes he was wearing . He traveled on a tourist visa , which did not permit him to work , but he found a job nonetheless , in a machine shop outside Chicago . // " The times were booming , and they needed machinists , " Arturo says . " It was hard . I did n't know the language . I lived by myself . No family . No friends . I suffered from loneliness . " // Nine months later , in September 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough money to throw the wedding of the year in Valle Hermoso one month later . Raul was born there on Aug. 28 , 1971 . Eleven months later his father was back in Illinois , alone and working illegally to support the family . His wife , Yolanda , and infant child finally joined him , but they could not abide the winter winds that howl off Lake Michigan . " It was too cold , " says Arturo . " They were sick all the time . " // The family returned to Mexico in 1974 . The next year Arturo was trying his hand at farming  --  with a used tractor he had bought for $8,000  --  when a Houston company offered him the job , as a machinist , that ultimately settled his nomadic life . This time , with a green card allowing him to work , he was a " legal . " // Arturo has been a boxing aficionado for as long as he can remember , and he began taking his son to Houston gyms when the boy was nine . Raul won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran home to show my mother the trophy , " he says . " And my busted lip . " // Shortly after Hagler won the middleweight title in 1980 , Arturo began tutoring Raul in the living room of their Houston home . Boxing became their bond . So that Raul could become eligible to compete for a spot on U.S. teams in international competition , Arturo applied for U.S. citizenship , which he received in 1986 , opening the way for Raul to become a citizen two years later . " He did it for me , " Raul says . // In the tradition of the newly minted U.S. citizen , Arturo preached to his son the ways and truths of the promised land . " This is the land of opportunities , " he told Raul , " and you can be what you want to be . But you have to work very hard . " // The boy worked hard enough . When his father was nearly killed in an automobile accident in 1987  --  he suffered broken ribs and crushed feet when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raul stopped boxing for 15 months , waiting for Arturo to recover . " Just to keep in shape , " he says , he took up high school track and cross-country . He ran a 4:39 mile . // In 1990 , after losing a close decision in the finals of the Goodwill Games to Romania 's Francisc Vastag , Raul decided to turn professional . Lou Duva , who will probably train him as a pro after the Olympics , and Arturo immediately put a stop to those plans . " Do n't do this ! " Duva said . " You 've got to go to the Olympics . You need the recognition ! " // So Marquez kept on course , working harder than ever . This year he has already whipped his two most difficult potential Olympic foes  --  Juan Lemus of Cuba and Germany 's Torsten Schmitz  --  and he has a solid chance to win a medal in Barcelona . No American throws more hurtful gloves or fights with more fire . Today his old man sits before him in blissful wonder , beholding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked outside the law in Chicago . " A lot of people are embarrassed to say they were illegal , but I 'm proud of what I did , " says Arturo . " I did it for my family . Sometimes I cry when I think about it . Now my son has made the U.S. Olympic team . He worked very hard for this . He deserves to be where he is . On this team . " // On his way to Barcelona . " To win the gold , " Raul says .
