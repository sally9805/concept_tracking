On a friday evening near the end of May , at twenty minutes past eleven , Joe Canttell put the finishing touches on his suicide outfit . His apartment was a third-floor walk-up right above the Mary Street Bar and Grill , which had always suited Joe fine , since it made a convenient place to interview his clients . Until recently . Recently , his luck having rather spectacularly run out , he had decided to call everything quits . <p> From the first he had known he would wear black . He considered it the most tasteful color to be found dead in . But he had dismissed black leather as too obvious . He had settled on a recycled ribbed tire-rubber body suit set off by very dark green hip-waders , fancied up with a few dangly marital aids and a bright scarlet bandanna knotted at the neck , where the needles would go in . Dressed , he observed his reflection admiringly in the second of his three full-length bathroom mirrors , flexing , posing , readjusting his basket , flexing and posing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . <p> It 's not , he thought to himself , as though I would n't have had a few good years left in me . He was a muscular black-haired man in his early thirties , of medium height , skin medium-white ( grimed rather than tanned ) , jaw medium weak , shadowed by a dark beard kept meticulously trimmed . His deep , warm eyes were all in all his best feature , unless you counted what he called his DNA delivery system , which he possessed in lavish proportions . <p> The other thing Joe Canttell possessed in lavish proportions was the latest strain of human immuno-deficiency virus , copulating merrily within his blood . That he had known for some time . But several weeks back Joe had noticed his first sarcomas : several livid pseudobruises on his upper inner thigh , where ( considering his line of work ) he could not afford them to be and could not cover them with makeup . He had had their nature confirmed : the report-sheet from the local free clinic lay on the kitchenette table where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going to bed . <p> When the overworked clinician had told him the news , the first words out of Joe 's mouth had been , " Minnie , Minnie , tickle a parson , " one of the many biblical references with which Joe 's childhood was weighted . The clinician gave him a talk on the treatments available , but by that time Joe had made up his mind . <p> " Let 's roll ! " announced Joe to the mirror , like the man in All That Jazz . Shouldering a drug-stuffed overnight bag and jiggling his marital aids , he took a last look around the apartment . Except for the bathroom mirrors and a Divine poster , it was almost militarily spare of furnishings . He wondered who would live here after he was gone , and if his ghost would haunt them . " Please , Lord , may it be a couple of Mormon missionary youths , " he quipped , then he kissed his reflection good-bye and shut the door behind him without locking it . <p> Down the stairs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right and down the stairs again . The bar music got louder as he descended . No looking back for Joe Cantrell . He had not looked back when he left his parents ' house at fifteen and he did not look back now . He wondered how his sister Delsie was ; he would have liked to have seen her again . But she had wed and bred dutifully within the faith , pleasing their parents , and though she had tried keeping track of him through his moves ( Salt Lake City , Chicago , Philadelphia , New York , Key West , San Francisco ) the letters had finally stopped coming . Like me , thought Joe . <p> Walking out of the building , he was lashed by noise from the open door of the bar . The front windows were gridded ; Joe liked to tell his clients it was to protect the street gangs from the customers . Joe was known for his ability to put his customers at ease . He wondered briefly if he should go inside and say good-bye to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like characters in a 1969 urban losers movie . Big ugly kind Eubie would be bouncer tonight ; big handsome vicious Sam would be tending bar ; big motherly corroded Alexandra Marie would be waiting tables . Joe felt as close to Alexandra Marie as he did to anybody . They had shared needles and broken like-affairs . He wondered if she had given AIDS to him , or if he had given it to her ; then he considered his sexual history and broke into a disgusted guffaw . No matter now . He had begged her repeatedly to change her name , which had always sounded to him like a drag queen 's stage moniker . <p> Some sailors lounging at the entrance to the bar sent whistles his way , but he ignored them . It was his night ; no time for business . <p> He knew where he would do it . He turned left onto Fifth , where the street hustlers hung out . They called to him from their stations : " Yo , Joe . " " Hey , pobrecito . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all : Delores and Bobby and Cowboy and Gino Mongo . They liked him because he shared drugs with them ; they envied him because he had a Protector ' ( Maurice Callander himself , the sadistic little bastard ) and worked off the Escort Line in his own apartment . He supposed there was something picturesque about the street boys ' despair , and he wished now he had given that interview to the silly cow from WAXL . " The Dark Side of the Street , " the series had been called ; very daring . " Hey , Cowboy , " he replied . " Hey , DeeDee , looking good tonight . " <p> " Where you off to in such a hurry , Josephine ? " This was Gino Mongo . " And what you got in that there bag ? " He loomed up out of the shadow , all six feet seven of him . <p> Joe did not break his stride . " Paytime for Mister Maurice , Ginny , " he called to him . " We ca n't keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorlessly , but stepped back . Maurice 's name was still good for something . That 's all I need , thought Joe as he moved away . To get stabbed to death on the way to my own suicide . <p> Resisting every impulse to clutch his bag closer , Joe Canttell moved on down Fifth , past all the whores , south to Arcady where the pool halls clustered , west to bombed-out Nolan and south again to Magister . There were a lot of people on the street , enjoying the brief spring cool ; in two weeks it would feel like the height of summer . Halfway down Magister , he caught his first sour whiff of water and , almost simultaneously , a quick muted burst of small-arms fire . People scurried and ducked , but the trouble was some blocks away , back in the direction from which he had come . In a moment the normal pace of the night resumed . Suddenly Joe found his heart racing and his breath laboring . He was anxious , now , to get it over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick detour down an alley to avoid a gang parley , and he was upon the entrance to the cul-de-sac almost before he realized it . Brownstones looked down on him from all sides , like bystanders at an accident site . The Church Of Our Lady Of Perpetual Mercy lay at the end of the little street , its stone walls overshadowed with massive arbor-vitae , its wrought iron gate gaping . In the neighborhood it was called " The Church Of Our Lady Of Perpetual Misery , " or just , " Perp Miz " as in " You look like Perp Miz warmed over , girl . " Joe sidled through the gate and picked his way across the rubble-strewn yard . It was very dark , the street lamps in the neighborhood having taken wing , and twice he stumbled . By the time he rounded the corner of the church and barked his shins on the first of the gravestones , he was weeping uncontrollably . <p> He had not expected this . He paused to wipe his face . Come on , Josephina , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gravestones leaned like drunks . What moon there was barely limned the marble of the dry fountain , but it was enough for Joe to avoid running into it . He set his bag at its foot and looked up at the church wall . <p> The Virgin was there . Somehow , the folds of Her veil had gathered up the moonlight . He could see Her clearly : the tip of Her excessively Caucasian nose , the slight smile on Her untroubled Caucasian lips , the pale Caucasian eyelids downturned , watching the Caucasian Babe at Her Caucasian breast . The muscles at the base of his spine started to relax . He nodded to himself . This was how he had always wanted it : a white death , white as snow , while dressed in black . <p> He sat down at the base of the fountain beside his bag and opened it . From it he extracted the drugs and the syringes . He loaded the hypodermics and lined them up on his black-rubber lap . There was a cricket somewhere ; otherwise the graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he had completed the injections , he put the syringes back in the bag , put the bag down on the ground , lay back against the fountain , put his hands in his lap , and looked up at the Virgin . Having been raised Mormon , he had never had any particular feeling for the Mother of Christ beyond the vague feeling that she was the epitome of the good obedient Mormon mom , keeping herself pure so that the little incipient godlings of this world might take inspiration from the little godling to be born through her . Then he thought of Brother Oral , the Stake President , preaching in front of the auditorium at the Saints Alive ! Conference when he was nine . As a child he had worshipped the ground Brother Oral walked on . Brother Oral had taken kindly note of this , and had made the best of it . He had never tried to tell his parents . He had not even thought to . <p> He could no longer feel his feet . His legs were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not raise his arms to hug himself , so he kept his eyes on the Virgin , who smiled down at him unceasingly , or maybe just at the noshing Baby . He was beginning to fade into her face when the pain began . <p> It took him by surprise . He had thought he would be too out of it to feel any pain . But it stabbed so fiercely up from the left side of his chest that it made him gag , filled his mouth with the vomit taste of fear , stabbed out from someplace in the center of his heart , squeezing his lungs flat , popping his eyes . His sole goal became to get a breath , get a breath , get a breath . This is ridiculous , he thought . I 'm a suicide . What am I trying to breathe for ? He found he could not stop trying . Dimly he became aware that he had slipped from a sitting position and was lying on his right side in his black rubber suit at the base of the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having a heart attack , and that the drugs were paralyzing his respiratory system . Please God Mary Christ finish it oh God do n't let them find me like this ! It also seemed to be getting darker , which he assumed was because he was going blind . He tried to remember what he had loaded the syringes with . <p> And then the pain stopped , as though someone had flipped a switch . He opened his mouth and breathed , full breaths . It was wonderful . He felt wonderful . He sat up . Everything was still dark , but he could breathe and laugh and move , and he felt wonderful , though it was awfully hot . He had not noticed how hot it was getting . It was unbearable . He got to his feet and began unzipping his outfit . He found that he could unzip himself from head to foot , unzip the whole thing , head and neck and torso and marital aids and hips and hip-waders and feet , everything , unzip the whole thing and toss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white face staring , at the foot of the silent fountain beneath the Virgin 's silent gaze . It was not as dark as before , either . There was a light coming from somewhere above , not from Mary and her sucking Babe , but from higher up , gentle , watery , nacreous . <p> He began to see , very clearly , the outlines of the gravestones . They were glowing slightly under the watery light . DEUSDEDIT JONES , REQUIESCAT IN PACEM . 1899 . MARY ARBUTHNOT JONES , BELOVED WIFE AND DEVOTED MOTHER , LAID TO REST APRIL 17TH , 1920 . He could read every word . Stepping lightly from gravestone to gravestone , he traced the carvings with cool , deft fingers . ADDISON ENGLISH , DEACON OF THIS PARISH . MOTHER OF ANGELS PROTECT US . SARAH MINOR . GEORGE MINOR . VIRTUE MINOR . " That makes two of us , Honey , " he exclaimed , and burst out laughing again . <p> He wandered away from the church , out of the cul-de-sac and onto the street . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt lighter than he had felt in years . The glow seemed stronger over the river , so he headed that way . This end of Riverside was mostly warehouses , row after row of them : Acme Fisheries , Dolan Packing Company , Stateline Lumber . Between the hulks of them he spied dark water glimmering . He kept walking , the wind blowing sweetly , coolly through him . <p> The night after Oral had informed him he was getting too old , Joe had turned his first trick , as much for solace as anything else , but the man had insisted upon paying and that had felt good to Joe . After Oral he felt he had it coming . Five weeks later he celebrated his fifteenth birthday and the next day he was on a bus to Albuquerque . He scored in the bus station , and later in some bars . Soon he was robbed , then beaten up , then arrested . It was the first time he had ever been arrested and they sent him to a juvenile holding facility . Because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitied , befriended , and protected . There he learned to rape , beat , befriend , and protect in his turn , but he never did learn pity . The police eventually found out who he was and they contacted his parents . " We are going to contact your parents today , " said the man who came to talk with him once a week . The next day the man was back with a funny look on his face , and Joe knew he would never be going home again . <p> From Albuquerque he went to Denver , where a whore named Joepye took him under her wing and explained to him the benefits of professional patronage . Her boyfriend Beau taught him about free weights and cocaine . He tried to land some legitimate work , but he was too young and the pay was lousy . In Denver he spent his first birthday away from home . He went into a church and sat there in the dark ; then he went out again . At a bar he met Jerry , Jerry The Wig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of wig factories and boasted that in some distant past he had been Wigmaker To The Stars . Jerry fell madly in love with him and asked him to move in . Joe agreed . <p> Jerry had a lover already , a black queen named Maxx ( " With two exes , Honey , and more to come " ) . Joe acted as their houseboy . He had real duties other than sex and ( to his immense surprise ) a real salary , which Jerry paid him in cash , most of which he blew on coke . He found Jerry sweet and sad and undemanding , but he developed a huge crush on Maxx , whom he found utterly unsentimental , utterly unjealous , and utterly without shame of any kind . Maxx liked straight razors , not to hurt people with , just to collect and polish and hold up to the light and occasionally wear . During his stay with Maxx and Jerry , Joe learned to cook , clean , and chauffeur . At Jerry 's frequent glittering parties he learned silent smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sinkevich residence . " He learned massage . When he asked Jerry idly if he could open a bank account in his own name , Jerry said , " You need a residence to do that and you can not use any of my addresses or someone will find out and I will lose everything . " So one thing Joe did not learn was how to save money . <p> Joe was with Jerry and Maxx for two years . He did everything he could to please them since he could not open his own bank account , and by the second Christmas had begun to feel they were family . His real family he had not seen or spoken to for over three years . He had gotten permission from Jerry to write them from his post office box , and he had done so , saying only that he was okay and had a job and that they should n't worry about him . It was his sister Delsie who had finally answered , four months later , her letter opening with , " Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am praying for you . " He wrote back after a few months more , and they began their half-hearted correspondence , she far more faithful to it in the end than he , during all the years of which , by unspoken mutual agreement , they never once alluded to their parents even indirectly . <p> Three weeks after his eighteenth birthday , he came home from shopping for one of Jerry 's parties to find an uncharacteristically empty townhouse . In the foyer were stacked three large new suitcases and two new garment-bags of soft scarlet Italian glove-leather . When he opened them , he found them packed with the clothing and jewelry Jerry and Maxx had given him . On top of the top bag was a thick envelope . Inside it was a bundle of American Express traveler 's cheques , a one-way bus ticket to Salt Lake City , and a note in Maxx 's hand : " Kansas calls , Dorothy . " There was no note from Jerry . <p> He did not go back to Salt Lake City . He left all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pocketing the cheques and one of Maxx 's straight razors , walked out of the townhouse without looking back . At the bus station he bought a ticket for New York , where Jerry and Maxx had taken him many times nightclubbing and theater-hopping . When he got to New York , he went straight to Washington Square Park in the Village . There he began his career in the Big Apple by scoring some coke , getting robbed , chasing , catching , and cutting the kid who robbed him , running from the kid 's buddies , and ducking into an exceptionally sleazy jazz club ( " clubette , " Maxx would have called it ) . Eventually he ended up sharing a loft with a bunch of musicians who had what they called a " classic retro " band named Rat Fink . <p> He walked north on Riverside to the old pier . The wind was cool ; it was nice not to be so hot . Lights were shining from the Stateline Lumber building , a boating party , very swank , slim women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in dark suits and stiff collars topped with round-brimmed straw hats . The pier was hung with Chinese lanterns ; punts bobbed on the water . A bar had been set up . Corks popped ; people chattered high and chuckled low . A very young woman in a green fringed dress weaved over to him , her cigarette making firefly tracks in the night air . " Hey , Charley , " she said . She was very drunk . <p> " I 'm not Charley , Honey , " said Joe Cantrell She had on a lot of makeup . A tall man with a vulturine face shadowed her abruptly ; she rolled her eyes up at him and gave an exasperated sigh . " There you are , Charley . Be a pal and get me a drink , will you ? " <p> " You 've had enough , darling . " <p> The young woman pulled away . " I should think a girl would know when she 'd had enough . " <p> " Come along . " Blinking , she went with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not once did the vulturine man glance in Joe 's direction . Joe stood watching them go . He thought of the parties at Jerry 's . He had seen people like that there . He felt a peculiar rush of love for her , almost acid in its urgency . He wanted to follow them , knock him aside , take her arm , sit her down , put his arm around her , hold her until her dead docility passed and her defiance returned . Someone coughed politely . He turned . An old lady in a turban and Japanese kimono was regarding him shrewdly through a lorgnette . She said , " Unless I miss my guess , you should n't be here . " <p> " It was the water , " Joe said . She was beautiful . Light flowered from the red silk space between her sagging breasts and vined through every pore of her . " I was hot . " <p> " Of course you were . " She nodded , her turban bobbing . " But you 're going in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go forward . " <p> " Forward ? " Joe said . <p> " Toward the light , young man . Always toward the light . " She gestured with her lorgnette , north and east over Riverside . He saw that the glow from the sky now seemed slightly stronger there , in the direction of Mary Street and Fifth Avenue . " That 's where I came from , " he said . <p> " Of course it is . " <p> She melted back into the crowd of revelers . Three cops staggered by , red-nosed and merry , in dark blue dress uniforms with big brass buttons . Nobody seemed alarmed . The boats on the water moved silently , like sharks . <p> He walked away from the river back up the pier . Riverside was busy : lots of cars with small windows and running boards , theatergoers in furs ; the Odeon ; the Vanity . NOW APPEARING IN LIMITED ENGAGEMENT MISS FANNY BRICE . On the corner of Riverside and Arcady , the Riverside Hotel was awash in limousines . He passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced at a headline : PARIS FETES LINDBERGH . He turned up Arcady heading east . <p> There was snow on the street . Dark men in shabby coats , mufflers , and hats huddled in doorways for warmth . One of them , bareheaded , about twenty-five , stared at Joe as he passed ; otherwise , he was ignored . At Arcady and Eighth , a WPA gang was hoisting a statue onto a pedestal in front of the Crews-Butler Building . A little farther on , two black women in starched maids ' uniforms came out of an apartment building by a side entrance and nearly ran him over . He heard one say , " That Martian nonsense nearly scared me half to death . " At Seventh Avenue , he passed a construction site where women in work uniforms walked to and fro , bandannas around their heads . A sour-faced burly man stood with a pad and pencil giving gruff orders . Younger men in uniforms passed up and down the street , grinning at the women 's whistles and catcalls . WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUY WAR BONDS ! said Uncle Sam from his . <p> At Sixth , there was only fire . He could not feel it , but he could see it , and what was worse , he could hear it roaring , like a beast of endless appetite . The whole block was burning . Fire engines , truncated , absurdly small , sprayed water ineffectually from heavy fabric hoses . People screamed , ran , fell , burned . A cat jumped nearly into his face . He reached out by reflex , and caught it . It dug claws into him and clung shivering . People got up from where they were burning and wandered away , naked and glowing , while their remains thrashed and crisped . There was a pork rind smell in the air . <p> Carrying the cat , Joe kept walking . Sixth was behind him . The sky cleared of smoke and flame until only the pale mother-of-pearl glow remained . Big-mustached immigrant men and their plump , over-rouged wives strolled along behind baby carriages . I LIKE IKE , said lapel buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held his face to its belly and its warm heart thudded against his jaw . The buildings grew shabbier , the passersby darker of complexion . At a storefront chapel , an African man in a suit cut the crowd with a voice like a saw . Farther on , a tight knot of mourners had gathered in front of a TV store to watch the solemn cortege move up Pennsylvania Avenue . Street vendors with long hair sold love beads and bagged herbs to young people like themselves . He reached Fifth and turned left , where the pool parlors jumped and hummed like new . <p> Different whores were there , in silly clothes , all of them women . The cat wriggled free of his arms and padded amongst them without fear , leaking a faint light . There was no sign of Delores or Bobby or Cowboy or Gino Mongo . A pair of scared-looking , neatly dressed men handed out tracts to the whores , who tore them up without reading them , making crude remarks . " You tell ' em , girls ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men . " Hey ! " he yelled at the man . " Hey ! I 'm talking to you ! " The man paid no attention , bent low to his fellow , who with pursed lips and sidelong glances at the prostitutes hurried him along down the street . <p> Joe considered following them , but the sky was darker in the direction they were heading , and the Mary Street Bar and Grill was before him . Lights were on inside , and music , old stuff , loud but not strident . The paint on the sign was fresh ; so were the bars on the windows . He glanced up at his apartment window ; red-and-white-checked curtains fluttered at it , forming a backdrop to a window-box of red and white geraniums . He remembered Alexandra Marie once telling him that the first owner had lived above the place with his mother . Working girls around the corner and Mama in the attic , thought Joe . He wondered why he felt so sad . <p> As he stood bemused , a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . There was no time to move out of their way . He cried out , but they moved through him , and in that instant he felt their bodies around his : their sweat , their tight muscles , the beat of their hot blood , the heavy race of the alcohol through their veins , the clench of their thighs . They moved through and beyond him . He stood gasping ; it was like being born again . He blinked down at the cat , who was sitting on her haunches blinking up at him with wide owl eyes . <p> " Far out , " he said . <p> He walked into the bar . <p> Alexandra Marie Schenk bumped open the kitchen door with her butt , hoisting her heavy tray . " Hot stuff coming through ! " she hollered , as Joe had taught her , and several sailors laughed , as somebody nearly always did . She was still feeling the buzz from the cocaine she and Eubie the bouncer had shared . Good buddy , she thought . Joe was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was a fag . She wondered why he had n't come by tonight . It seemed to her that he had looked a little peaked recently . <p> She moved around the room , flirting with a few customers , fending off others , grinning and wise-assing , keeping the mood easy and fun . Everybody was tense tonight because of the shootings on Delmar . It was n't helping that Sam the Bartender was looking grimmer than usual in his Army camouflage muscle shirt and mirrored aviator sunglasses , speaking only in monosyllables , refusing to banter . His tattoos were the friendliest thing about him . They wiggled and winked with every move of his massive shoulders and arms . Alexandra Marie had a tattoo also : an ankh ' way down on her left ankle . She had hoped it would be a sort of bond between Sam and her . <p> But she and Sam were not good buddies . Sam was not good buddies with anybody . He liked his girlfriends much younger than the law allowed . Rumor had it that he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was done with them they disappeared . Sometimes Alexandra Marie fantasized about it , the way somebody who loathes and despises snakes will stand in the snake house at the zoo and stare . <p> The door opened and Maurice Callander came in , flanked by a pair of matched gumbies , one black , one white . Conversation did not still , the way conversations do in Westerns when the Bad Guy enters the saloon , but anuses in the know clenched all over the room . Maurice was skinny , child-faced , and dead-eyed ; he looked sick . Eubie the Bouncer clenched his jaw and nodded professionally at the gumbies , who did not return his nod , which made his nostrils dilate . Alexandra Marie approached Maurice , smiling . " Good evening , Mister Callander , " she said . " Would you like me to clear a booth for you ? " <p> " No , thank you , " replied Maurice in his bookie 's voice . " I will need to speak to Samuel , however . " The words had scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the words had become Sam , as though he had coalesced out of them . Sam looked at Eubie and jerked his thumb barward . Eubie did a fade . " Mister Callander , " Sam said , nodding . The two men , followed by the gumbies , strolled like old friends around the bar and disappeared through the swinging door in the back . <p> Immediately some local patrons floated from their stools , paid their tabs , and drifted toward the door . Most returned to their drinks as though nothing had happened ( Well , nothing has , reasoned Alexandra Marie ) . The atmosphere of the bar was much subdued for the next hour or so , despite Alexandra Marie 's attempts to work the room , smoothing things over and cheering things up . Then Sam returned from the back . He went to work as though he had just stepped out for five minutes to take a piss . Alexandra Marie knew better than to question his carefully blank face . <p> A little past one , the after-dance cruising crowd started filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mixed with the patrons , looking if anything better-dressed . Alexandra Marie wondered again where Joe Canttell was . He had usually dropped down by this time to check out the action . Out of the corner of her eye she noticed Ricky and Mickey come in . They were drag queens , semi-regulars from the Ritz Cabaret on Belmont . The Ritz Cabaret was owned by Maurice Callander , like everything else in this neighborhood . They were well known to Eubie the bouncer , who would have protected them from the other patrons if they had needed protection , but they never did , partly because they were experts with the switchblade and everyone knew it , and partly because Ricky was the grandson of a well-known local mob figure , not Maurice Callander . Music and cigarette smoke swirled around them . <p> Normally they both looked very , very cool , very vigilant , very competent . But tonight when finally Alexandra Marie got a second and bustled up to them to say hi ( Ricky was an excellent tipper ) , she took one look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the room to the hall where the public telephone was . " What in God 's name is wrong with you two ? " she demanded . <p> " Nothing , " said Ricky , shakily . His voice was theatrical and womanish . He was the elegant one , small and light-boned , with soft cascades of undyed silver hair and creamy translucent skin . Tonight he was dressed in a pale blue silk crepe de chine evening sheath which Alexandra Marie would have killed to fit into , and his face bore a stunned expression that made him look ten years younger . Mickey was the trashy one , Irish-red hair buzz-cut , cute freckles , multiple nose-rings , studded low-cut scarlet leather , tiny boobs , tattoos , and fishnet stockings . Oddly , he had always seemed to Alexandra Marie to be the more successfully female of the two . Mickey had once belonged to an all-pseudogirl group called the Whipettes . He was rumored to have a humongous penis . Tonight he looked thoughtful , which was so unusual for him that Eubie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double-take . " What 's the story ? " he rumbled . <p> " It 's Joe , " said Ricky . <p> " He 's dead , " said Mickey . <p> " Oh my God , " said Alexandra Marie . She put a scarred hand to her mouth , and sorrow burst in her heart like a water balloon . <p> " Ginny caught some kid with what looked like Joe 's bag , " growled Mickey . " Ginny made the kid tell him where he found it . The kid said he got it off some stiff . " He shrugged . <p> " But why ? " said Alexandra Marie . The silliness of the question struck her instantaneously . <p> " Where 'd they find him ? " asked Eubie . He did not bother to ask " How did it happen ? " If there had been something left near the body for the child to steal , then it had not been murder , which left only two other avenues for a junkie : accidental O.D. or suicide . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin . " <p> " Did anyone call the police ? " asked Alexandra . The three men looked at her with identical expressions , like a sister act . She said helplessly , " He might still be alive . He might be in a coma . " <p> " He was dead , Alexandra Marie , " said Mickey harshly . <p> She turned to Eubie . " Call them , for Christ 's sake ! " The big man rolled his eyes to heaven and reached for the telephone , holding out his pale palm for a quarter . She dug in her apron and slapped one down against his fingers , so angry she could not see . It did not seem right to let Joe just lie there in the dark . <p> A shout from the bar summoned her back into the evening 's fray . There was no question of disobedience ; there was nothing she could do for Joe , not now , not ever . As she hurried off , she heard Eubie suggesting politely to the queens that they not spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular evening . A leisurely time later , an ambulance wailed past , heading south and east . When she turned around again at the next lull , the queens were gone and Eubie was busy hanging some drunks out to dry . It was nearly three in the morning , closing time , before she was able to think of Joe again . <p> Accompanied by Eubie , she climbed the stairs to Joe 's apartment , wondering what they would find there . They found the door unlocked . Inside , Divine stared down at them from the wall with a challenging expression on his alien face . All of Joe 's things were there . Eubie did a quick search of the rooms for abandoned pharmaceuticals , which , he pointed out logically , an ascended Joe Canttell could not possibly need . He was disappointed to find only a little pot , which he pocketed , offering to divide it with Alexandra Marie , who declined . In Joe 's bedroom , she poked through an opened dresser drawer and found a book . She pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in leather . In the front of it , on the blank page before the title page , someone had written in a childish scrawl JOSEPH SMITH CANTRELL . Many of the pages were marked , passages underlined , YES ! written in the margins by some of them in the same young hand . She turned back to the title page . The Pearl of Great Price , it said . She put the book back in the drawer . <p> In the end she took only a little china figurine , a pretend Irish house with a green shamrock on the side which she had found in a secondhand shop and given Joe one Christmas as a gag , for good luck . Eubie kept taking things out of closets and putting them in stacks . " I 'm going , " she said to him . He grunted and kept rummaging . She left the apartment and walked downstairs . Outside , it was the gray place between night and morning . <p> The first two things Joe noticed when he entered the Mary Street Bar were that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the glow he had been tracking was here as well , hovering somewhere near the ceiling . Cigarette smoke billowed through it in innocent white clouds . The jukebox was jumping and the place was packed . Uniformed servicemen rubbed shoulders with bikers , drag queens with stevedores , immaculate clean-shaven men in dark glasses with map-faced grizzled winos , and nobody was fighting ; there was laughter and good-natured swearing , backslaps , table-pounding , but nothing ugly ; a holiday mood . When was Mary 's ever like this ? he thought . He saw nobody he knew . The cat rubbed against his leg and he picked it up again . <p> There were two new bartenders on duty , white guys , working like dogs . The glow from the ceiling lit up the tiers of liquor bottles , striking sparks from their dim interiors . He moved slowly toward the counter . A Marine lumbered through him , shouting beerfly ; then a pale junkie clinging with a silly smile on her face to her silent beau-of-the-moment ; then a tray-hoisting waitress breathing tobacco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh and blood and bursting sensual vitality , in and through and gone in a flash . Even the sick ones are so damn alive , he thought . He looked for the wall clock he was used to ; it was not in its accustomed location over the bar and he could not find another . It had to be late . Where was Alexandra Marie ? <p> He turned his back to the bar just as the street door opened . Two men came in . One was Maurice Callander , looking robust and tanned . His companion was in his late twenties , ruggedly built , black-haired and black-mustached , with a more than slightly worn street beauty , a rather weak chin , and quick , observant eyes . He was wearing a tight T-shirt , fatigue trousers , and dog-tags . His nipples showed through his T-shirt . Joe found himself assessing the youth from a professional standpoint . He was obviously trade ; he had good chest , good arms with no obvious track marks , good thighs ; probably a good basket though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ; and he would not be young much longer . <p> The cat stirred in Joe 's grip , kneaded his right wrist with its right paw . With a start he realized where and when he was . It was the night the Mary Street Bar and Grill had reopened under new management , the management of local entrepreneur Maurice Callander . And it was the night he , Joe Canttell , had come to what would prove to be his final place of residence . No wonder everybody was happy : drinks had been on the house that night . The arrival of Alexandra Marie was a year or so in the future ; Eubie would not sign on for three , Sam the Bartender for four or five . Remembering , Joe stared afresh at his younger self , standing polite and attentive at Callander 's side . They would go upstairs soon , to what would be Joe 's apartment for the final ten years of his life . Afterward , Callander would say he had " class " and " would make a mint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties , set him up in business . Joe felt himself gripped with a fierce pride . Go for it , kiddo , he thought . Show ' era what a talented Utah boy can do ! Because he needed to kiss somebody , he kissed the cat on the top of its furry head . <p> And felt a tap on his right shoulder . <p> He turned . It was Maxx . He was dressed in a brilliant gold-lame sheath and shoulder-length Marilyn Monroe blonde wig . His lipstick and nail polish were violent purple . He was not wearing any razors . He waved a hand in the smoky air . " So what do you think , Honey ? " he yelled over the music . " Is n't it a riot ? I always did love a party . " <p> " Is that really you , Maxx ? " asked Joe . " You look like a Supreme on acid . " <p> " Define ' really ' in this context , Chicken , " drawled Maxx from beneath heavy purpled lids . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A whore staggered through him and away . Maxxx watched her go and shook his head . " Honestly , these styles ! You have to love the Eighties . Who 's your friend ? " He indicated the cat . <p> " He was in a fire , " said Joe . The cat matched Maxxx 's lidded stare with one of its own . " Maxxx , are you  --  if you can see me , I mean touch me , then you must be  --  " <p> " Dead ? " Maxxx put his palms to his cheeks and made a violet moue of mock horror . " Sugar , it 's all right . You can say the word ; it wo n't kill you . Of course I 'm dead . We 're all dead . That 's why we came . To see you off . " <p> " ' We ? ' " said Joe . <p> " The Gang . Come on over and say hidy . " Maxxx took him by the left arm and propelled him through shifting waves of patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a couple of round tables had been set up next to each other . At one table sat the turbaned old woman with the lorgnette who had steered him toward the light . She had a large piece of chocolate-frosted chocolate layer cake in front of her , a third consumed , and she was gazing upon the others indulgently . Next to her slouched Beau , Joepye 's bi boyfriend , who had introduced Joe to coke and free weights . He was looking shy but happy ; perhaps , thought Joe , he was shy about being happy . Next to him , flirting madly in drunken monologue , sat the girl in the green fringed dress . She was evidently free of her vulturine companion and enjoying it , throwing back her head with an open-throated laugh as she gestured wildly with her cigarette-holder . Next to her , contemplatively slugging Jim Beam out of a bottle , was Dolph Klegg , the drummer from Rat Fink . Dolph had liked water sports and had been the one who 'd pressured the others to let Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers on the tabletop to the music from the jukebox . Joe wondered how he 'd died . Next to him was an empty chair . <p> At the second table sat the bare-headed man from the winter Depression street , nursing a beer and talking quietly with a thin-boned , big-nosed , kind-faced woman who looked as out of place in this raucous dream of a bar as anyone could have looked . She appeared to be drinking seltzer , and she listened to the quiet man with evident pleasure . She was , Joe realized with a start , his second grade teacher , Miss Arquette , whom he had not thought of in over twenty years . Next to her was Tarantula , the gorilla-like bouncer from Thrash , the place in Key West Joe had hung out a lot . ' Rant , Joe recalled , had been into breath suppression scenes , and Joe knew very well how he 'd died : a shot to the head during a midnight drug run off Islamorada . He was playing placid poker with a big man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make out his features . Next to him was another empty chair . " Hey , everybody ! " Maxxx cried . " See who I found wandering around like a lost soul ! " <p> They looked up at his hail , their cheeks flushed with talk and booze , looked up and called and waved in surprise and glad pleasure . The turbaned lady said , " Well , at last , at last . " Beau said , " Hey , Jose , " their little joke . The sequined girl said , " Welcome to the party , darling ! " Dolph said , " Yo , Joey ; how 's it hangin ' , bro ' ? The street guy raised his beer bottle in toast . Miss Arquette said , " Joseph , you are a picture . " Tarantula rumbled something inaudible , flashing a gold-toothed grin . And the man on the end turned around and looked up , and it was Brother Oral . <p> Joe stood where he was . The cat squirmed and dropped out of his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left cheek , and patted his ass . " Come on , Joe . It 's your party . " <p> " Come on , Joe ! " " Hey , buddy , get over here ! .... Joseph ? " But he could not move . Oral was exactly the way Joe remembered him : big-shouldered , round-faced , dove-eyed , in a gray polyester suit with a white shirt and a burgundy tie . He met Joe 's gaze steadily , with a kind , wise affection that Joe knew only too well . <p> Joe took a step backward . Maxxx let go of him . " Okay , " Joe said . " I get it now . I get it . " <p> " Hush , " said the old woman with the lorgnette to the others . " Let him speak . " They fell silent , watching him , merry no longer . " Okay , Maxxx , " Joe said to his friend . " I think I get what 's going on now . This is it . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Where fags and other sinners go when they die , or the prelude to it . Our last chance to howl , right ? And then what ? Limbo for suicides ? Weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing for working boys ? Or just a repentant reincarnation as a missionary sister in West Hollywood ? ' <p> " No , Honey . " <p> The jukebox sounded as loud as ever , but the drag queen 's gravity was louder . Joe gritted his teeth and spun around , looking for somebody to take it out on . He took in the Mary Street Bar : patrons , whores , staff , junkies , cigarette and reefer smoke , the odd glow from the rafters . " If this is n't , " he said desperately , and stopped . He turned back to the waiting , watchful group . " If this is n't the gate to Hell . And if you are n't  --  " He stopped again . The cat had jumped up on the table next to Brother Oral and was observing him mildly . Its eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He realized that he was crying , and he was not sure why . It was not shame ; not shame , at least , for what he was or had become . It was something else he did not have a name for . " If this is heaven , " he managed through chattering teeth , " then what the fuck is that goddamn fucking child molester doing here ? " <p> " Oh , honey , " said Maxxx . He held out a purple-nailed hand , palm up . There was a spot of blood in the center of the palm , and as Joe watched , it welled up larger and larger until it spilled and dropped down over his fingers and onto the floor of the bar . Joe looked past him to the others . They were holding their palms up , too : the turbaned lady , Beau , the flapper , Dolph the drummer , the street guy , the teacher , even Oral . And in the center of each palm , male or female or slender or broad or gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stigmata welled and flowed : He raised his own hands . They felt normal , and they looked fine from the back : big knuckles , strong veins ( " Nothing like good old junkie venation ! " somebody had said to him once ) , black hairs like wires , thick wrists . He had never been good at fisting ; his hands were too big . He turned them over . Two bright eyes of blood winked back at him , dripping . <p> " Welcome to the family , Joe , " said Maxxx . <p> And heaven , like a pearl , descended . <p> <p> <p> By Rand B. Lee <p> Rand B.
