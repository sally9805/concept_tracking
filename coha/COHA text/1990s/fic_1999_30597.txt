Caroline Carter and her husband , Ralph , as a couple are impressive , even imposing : perched at the top of a broad concrete flight of stairs , in one of San Francisco 's prettiest , greenest and most elevated parks ( the view is marvellous , hills and tall buildings , church spires and further high green parks ) , they draw a lot of attention from the stray passers-by , the dog walkers and strollers , on this bright April Sunday . For one thing they both look foreign , Caroline and Ralph , although Caroline has lived in this city for many years and Ralph is a native son . But now , out of the country for over five years , they wear mildly eccentric clothes . Caroline 's heavy gray sweater ( she expected fog ) is un-American in design , as is the cut of Ralph 's tweed jacket . Also , they are very large people , Caroline a tall fair woman , broad-faced , serene , with wide-set green-blue eyes and heavy gray-blonde hair  --  and Ralph a towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hostile press . Ralph is Caroline 's third husband , and she his fourth wife  --  an unpropitious history , perhaps , but after twenty-five years this marriage seems to have taken : they look quite permanently married . And , almost rich and almost old , Caroline is back in a city where for many years she was young and almost broke , where four of her five daughters were born , and where she enjoyed a number of lovers . A lively life , then , and in its way romantic , although Caroline is eminently a realist , a practical , sensible woman . Or so she sees herself , generally . At the moment they are sitting there like tourists in the early sunlight , looking down the terraced hill and across the street to their own house  - -  e does not mind this comment from Ralph , whom she loves ( usually ) ; she has needed , repeatedly , to say how she feels about these particular daughters , the very rich ones : Fiona , at thirty-three the well-known restaurateur ( does anyone say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill , at thirty-one a very rich young lawyer-stockbroker . " Well , there 's always Portia , " Ralph put in , now in his turn repeating himself . " We can count on her not to get ahead , I think . " Portia , twenty-five , is the one and only daughter from the marriage of Caroline and Ralph . " Well , you 're right about Portia , " says Caroline about this youngest , most problematic child . " And then there 's Sage , " she adds , with a sigh for her eldest daughter , a bravely unsuccessful , highly talented ( in her mother 's view ) ceramicist , whose strange , small , intensely expressive figures sell rarely or not at all , in their occasional viewings , in local galleries . Sage , now forty-one , is the product of Caroline 's very early ( at nineteen ) marriage to Aaron Levine , who died in that war , in 1943 , before Sage was born . Subtle , dark Sage is the image of her father . She seems given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacularly unfortunate love affair with a local lawyer-politico , she married a man named Noel Finn , who is overly handsome ( again , in Caroline 's view ) , a carpenter , some seven years younger than Sage . " Sage will be the first to come today , " says Caroline , who is now beginning to speak her thoughts aloud . " And she 'll bring some present that I wo n't quite know what to do with . And there 'll be some excuse about Noel . " Caroline is right , as things turn out , but before that happens she and Ralph get up and walk about , and they t alk about how much San Francisco has changed since they left it in 1980 ( Reagan 's year , as they think of it ) , and how much they like their house , despite neighborhood changes . Behind where Caroline and Ralph were sitting is a tall grove of waving pines and redwoods , enclosing a little play area for children . Sandboxes , slides  --  all at the moment unoccupied , amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long flight of stairs is flanked by terraces of grass , marked off with hedges and narrow paths . And below is a street , on the other side of which is a row of very attractive houses , all originally ( just before the turn of the century ) identical . And one of these is Caroline and Ralph 's . It is really Caroline 's house . She bought it when she first came to San Francisco as a young widow in the Forties , an investment for which she used the last of her husband 's insurance money . The house was in bad shape at that time , sagging and neglected ; Caroline , who is skillful with houses , had it all fixed up  --  and in the course of that long process ( she kept running out of money ) she grew to love the house but could not afford to live in it . Also , her next ( second ) husband , Dr. James McAndrew , did not like the neighborhood , at that time considered " bad , " too close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area where mostly black people lived . And so , with Jim , Caroline moved to a " better " neighborhood , and she rented out her house . ( Liza , now thirty-five , and then Fiona and Jill came in an orderly succession during that marriage of Caroline 's to Jim  --  whom she divorced in 1959 in order to marry Ralph , by whom she was then pregnant with Portia . ) As Caroline herself would have been the first to admit , she was stubborn and foolhardy about the house , rather than prescient . She did not have an instinct for real estate , she did not think in those terms . Her feelings about the house 's drastic rise in value are ambivalent , to say the least ( upper Fillmore Street was " gentrified , " the black people " relocated " ) . She did have an instinct for houses , perhaps an atavistic inheritance from her English mother , the actress-playwright Molly Blair . She bought the house , really , because it was small and beautiful ; she felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . But Ralph , when they first married , did not want to live in the house for an opposite reason to Jim McAndrew 's : for him the neighborhood was much too fancy , he felt ( Ralph is a former longshoreman , later a political writer ) . Then , in 1980 , Molly Blair died , and a subsequent revival of interest in her work , publication of new editions of her plays , gave Caroline , her only child , a fair amount of money . And Reagan was elected . And Ralph had a mild heart attack . " Take it easy . Change your life , " he was fairly forcefully advised . For a combination of reasons , then , after distributing much of her money among her daughters , Caroline and Ralph took off for Portugal , where they spent almost five years  --  during which the tenants of the house were elderly friends of Caroline 's , who died within months of each other this past year , a strong reason for the return from Portugal of Caroline and Ralph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer practicality helped to persuade Ralph to live there after all . Their south garden , a treasure , widely coveted in San Francisco , grew bountifully  --  just now , in Apri l , full of roses and camellias , rhododendron , white wisteria . " It 's a perfect house for two people , " in their sunnier moments Caroline and Ralph have remarked to each other . And , at darker times , " How can the two of us possibly occupy a whole house ? with all the homeless people  --  " In their walk about the park , marking time until the arrival of the daughters and the pre-emption of their own roles , in their own house , Ralph and Caroline have touched lightly on all these topics , including that of the beauty of their garden . " It must be in my genes , " Caroline has earlier remarked . " The way I respond to gardens . I absolutely fall in love . " " Except that I really like the garden too , " Ralph tells her . " My Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents all were Texans , a fact often manifest in his voice . Especially as he ages , Caroline thinks , he sounds more and more Southern . Texan . And they now return to the more pressing topic of their daughters . So many ! Whatever have I done to deserve five daughters ? rueful Caroline has been heard to remark , and there does seem a certain illogic to that fate , in her particular case . ( And it was in many ways the presence of all those young women in San Francisco  --  like many California offspring , those five can not imagine life elsewhere , for themselves  --  that kept Caroline for all those years away in Portugal . " I simply do n't want to be so present in their lives , " said Caroline . ) " I sometimes do n't think Sage really likes Fiona very much , " Caroline next remarks . " Or for that matter Jill . " " How could she ? All that money that both of them seem to have . " Ralph tends to speak more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he sometimes accuses Caroline of doing . " But she and Liza always seem great pals . " " Everyone likes Liza . She 's the most like you . " This is a remark that Caroline often hears , not only from Ralph  --  so often that she is tired of responding to it . What she might say , of herself and Liza , might be : We only sort of look alike , both being large , and she has three children . But we 've got very different characters , lucky for her . Ralph , that quintessential American , that most unlikely expatriate , was in fact quite happy in Lisbon , during those years . His solution  --  and this was a part of the overall unlikeliness of it all  --  was to domesticate himself , in ways hitherto quite unimaginable for him . He not only learned to cook , he went out to markets and he bargained , endlessly and successfully , in a language he could not speak , coming home with the largest cod and the smallest shellfish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life before that had been of the most intense and public involvement ; in San Francisco he was known to be a not-too-secret political kingmaker  --  and a man who had always come home , to all those wives , expecting meals on time and clean clothes , a clean bed and a pretty , accommodating wife , and who had always found all that , except for very brief between-wife periods . " It 's something new for me , " was Ralph 's explanation to Caroline . And , " I like the fish . " She came to understand that he also liked the docks and the fishermen , the whole waterfront atmosphere ; it was what he was used to , and missed . Whereas Caroline , who had spent her life in domestic pursuits , now spent all her days in museums and galleries . She even did some sketches and some tentative watercolors from their small apartment , high up in the Alfama , the old quarter of Lisbon , near the Castel San Georgio . They had a view of the harbor , boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built to commemorate the Generals ' Revolution , the end of fascism . And all around them geraniums bloomed , on balconies and terraces , every shade from white to pink , orange to deep scarlet . One of the best aspects of Lisbon was its access to the rest of Europe . Ralph and Caroline flew to London or Paris or Rome , they took trains to Madrid or Barcelona . And so those Portuguese years worked out quite well  --  but nevertheless they both became quite restless , impatient . Travel writing was not his mtier , Ralph decided , and Caroline felt that her sketches were hopelessly amateur . And then everything seemed at once to conspire to bring them home , most immediately the deaths of their tenants , the vacancy of their house . They both , especially Caroline , had a sense that by this time theirdaughters were all right , or were at least settled on courses that they , the parent figures , would be unlikely to deflect . Sage had her ceramics , and her marriage to Noel . Liza was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three babies . Fiona had her restaurant , Jill her law and her money . And Portia had her Bolinas shack , where ( it was generally believed ) she wrote poetry . What could change ? " Well , of course you were right , there 's Sage 's car . " Unnecessarily , Ralph points downward to the battered , mud-spattered , once-black , once-convertible VW . Sage is just getting out , alone , and maneuvering a very large box . Tall , too-thin Sage is wearing white pants , probably Levi 's , andsomething striped on top that is from Cost Plus , probably . Sageresists clothes , she tends to beat them up , to pour liquids over them.Her long , very dark hair is unfashionably pony-tailed . All in all sheseems to be saying that she does not care , does not care that she isgetting into her forties , that her husband is seven years younger andvery handsome . But Caroline , looking at Sage as objectively as possible , still thinks that this daughter , this difficult eldest , is very beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fiona and Jill are sexy but not true beauties . " But they also agree that Sage should fix up a little more , as Ralph puts it . ( Liza is very pretty but too fat , and Portia is , well , odd-looking ; she looks like Ralph . ) Caroline calls out to Sage from where they are walking down the steps , and Sage waits for them where she stands , leaning against her dirty old car , with her big brown cardboard box . " Noel had to go down the Peninsula , " is the first thing that Sage says , with a quick downward twist of her mouth  --  once kisses have been exchanged among the three of them , out there on the sidewalk , in the very unseasonal hot sun . " Honestly , these damn clients expect maintenance too , " Sage says , and then adds , with a lift of her small cleft chin , " Of course it 's a lot his fault . Noel loves to feel indispensable . " " Darling . I suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caroline still sounds just faintly British , more inheritance from Molly . Her father was a New Englander , a Connecticut Yankee . " Men are like that , kiddo . " Ralph likes teasing Sage , who has been known not to take it very well , possibly ( Caroline thinks ) because she was an only child for all those years , those six before Li za was born . And perhaps for the same reason Caroline is aware of being over-protective of this daughter . Still . " Sage , whatever have you brought in that great box ? " As they walk toward the house Caroline for an instant puts an arm across her daughter 's thin shoulders . " Ca n't Ralph carry it in for you ? " " No , it 's okay . " As they reach the front steps , from inside the house the phone begins to ring , and Ralph hurries in to get it . " That could be Noel , " Sage tells her mother . " Coming after all . Maybe . " Her smile is brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " says Caroline . " Well honey , I 'm just sorry , " they hear Ralph say as they enter . " We 'll do it later . See you and celebrate . " " Portia , " says Caroline to Sage . " You 're so always right , " says Sage , with a little laugh . " I know , it 's tiresome , is n't it . Sage , do put that down . " " It 's Portia , want to talk to her ? " Ralph , from the kitchen phone . " No , just give love . " Caroline and Sage then walk through the long narrow white Victorian living room , through the dining room to the deck , where at last Sage deposits the big square box . Very carefully ; clearly its contents could break . " Portia 's car has died . " Ralph has come out to stand beside them , on the deck that Caroline has so filled with pots of flowers that very little room is left for furniture , or for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white , and smaller bushes of yellow , peach and pink and lavender ( Sterling Silver , a delicate favorite of Caroline 's ) , but also two lemon trees , and three large wooden tubs of poppies and ranunculuses , all now in bloom . And smaller pots of thriving marguerites , all over . Below the deck and down in the garden are still more roses , tall rose trees and bushes of roses , all placed at rather formal intervals , in tidy beds that surround a circular area of brick . In the farthest bed , at the very back of the garden , are two enormous twin camellias , now profusely flowering , dark scarlet . It has been so far an exceptionally sunny spring , leading to talks of drought , and Caroline has feared for her flowers , just now so lovely . " You might as well open your present , " Sage instructs , indicating the box , with a smile that to her mother signals pride . Caroline works at the taped-down flaps , and then for no reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guesses , as she opens presents ) she says , " I know , you 've made me a birdbath . " " Jesus , Mother . I hate you , I really do . " Dismayed at the accuracy of her intuition ( and , having had it , why on earth did she have to blurt it out like that ? ) , Caroline sees that what Sage has brought is a birdbath : a wide , shallow , blueglazed bowl , with tiny birds , a small frieze of birds perched here and there on its ridge . " But darling , it 's so beautiful , that glaze  --  " " But how did you know what it was ? Jesus , Mother . " Sage 's thin lovely face is pulled into a frown . Her pale-brown skin is lightly freckled , her eyes troubled but golden , clear gold . " I do n't know , it was just a lucky guess . Let 's put it over here . Look , it 's perfect . " " All that noise has got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always think of what I really lust for , " adds Caroline , to Sage . " I did want a birdbath . I need one , and this is ravishing . " She goes over to give Sage a quick light kiss . Fiona 's arrival is a big production , taking place as it does from her restaurant 's big white van . FIONA is emblazoned on one side . And Fiona has brought along an assistant , a fat , very pretty young woman who immediately begins to unload a series of white food boxes . " You did n't exactly leave me a lot of room , " is Fiona 's opening remark to her older half-sister , Sage . " I did n't know you were bringing that truck , I thought the Ferrari . " " How could I get all this food into the Ferrari ? " " How many people did you think were coming ? " asks Ralph , as boxes are passed into the kitchen , either stacked or piled into the refrigerator . " Well , is n't Liza bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're little , " Caroline reminds her . " Oh well . " Fiona 's pale-blonde hair is very long ; all three of Caroline 's daughters by Jim McAndrew have wispy blonde hair , as he does , and they have his eyes , very large and pale gray . Fiona dresses smartly , always , " dressed for success , " as the advertisers ( and her sisters ) put it . Today she wears very tailored pale linen , two shades of brown , and trim brown shoes  --  in which she now walks about the deck , inspecting flowers , then looking into the birdbath . " Terrific , " is her mild comment . Fiona is thin , very thin , but nature intended her to be otherwise , or so Caroline thinks , observing this daughter . Caroline sees Fiona 's wide bones , quite like her own , stretching the pummelled , pampered skin . Sexy Fiona , how odd that she seems to have no lovers , thinks sexy Caroline . " Where 's Jill ? " Fiona then asks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we have n't heard from her . " " Some big deal in her life , no doubt , " sniffs Fiona . To say that Fiona is ambivalently pleased by the success of her younger sister would be to put it mildly . " Portia 's car died , " contributes Ralph . " " Lord , what else is new ? " " Well , it must be time for drinks , what would everyone like ? " Caroline and Ralph say these things at almost exactly the same moment , then laugh at themselves for so doing . Sage wants wine with some ice in it . " I know that 's awful , Noel the purist would die , but it 's just so hot . " Fiona wants a Perrier . In the kitchen , faced with all those boxes of food , Ralph and Caroline exclaim to each other , " Look at all she 's brought , it 's terrible , we 'll have to take it all somewhere  --  some shelter , a food bank . " " Well , anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trooping up the steps are two small children in impressively white clothes , followed by their parents : Liza , carrying a baby , a very small one ; and Saul Jacobs , the father , psychiatrist , carrying several paper sacks and also a very large bunch of oversized pink peonies . ( And Caroline thinks , as she sometimes has before , how very much she likes this shrink son-in-law , this Saul  --  and how little she seems to feel for the children . Her grandchildren . They 're quite nice enough , in their way , but after all only children . And she wonders , perhaps her strong affections for the very young are simply worn out , nothing left ? ) Liza is as large as , in Caroline 's view , Fiona was meant to be . In her invariable blue denim prairie skirt , her white lace Mexican blouse , blue beads , she bustles in and kisses everyone present in turn , with effusive greetings for all . " Mom , you look super , you look home . Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you enough chores to keep you happy ? Skinny Fiona , what on earth have you brought in all those boxes , goodies to keep the rest of us all happy and fat ? Darling Sage , you look so beautiful , where 's Noel ? " And , turning back to her mother and Ralph , " Where 're Jill and Portia ? " " Portia 's car , " they tell her . " We have n't heard from Jill . " " Noel had to work , " Sage adds . By this time , Fiona 's helper is carrying boxes out onto the deck , and , assisted by Ralph , Fiona begins to arrange an assortment of salads , cold pastas and thick cold soups . And cheese and fruit and pastry . Mustards , relishes . Breads and special butters , in crocks . We 'll never be able to eat all that , Caroline begins to say , and then does not , not wishing to sound unappreciative of her daughter 's largesse . But it is n't really largesse , she reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious sense that expense-account meals are free , and certain trips . All are part of an extremely expensive bit of unreality , the unreality in which the very rich spend all their time , insulated , as though in capsules . Including Fiona and the absentJill . And then , more practically , she thinks , Well , Liza can take home some leftovers . Picnic lunches all week for the kids . And she thinks , at the rate Saul 's going he 'll certainly never be rich . ( Saul donates considerable time , most recently to an emotional-support project for people with AIDS . ) A light confusion then takes over the party , and reigns for the next several hours , actually . There is not enough ice : how come Caroline had not emptied and refilled all the ice trays early on ? ( It is Caroline who demands this , aloud , of herself , Ralph not being given to that sort of petulant nagging . ) The children want a variety of soft drinks , mostly ones not there . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just settle down , " Saul , their stern father , tells them . And is n't it time to eat ? All the cold food will warm up in the sunshine and lose its flavor , according to Fiona . Then from the doorway is heard a voice , high-pitched and quite familiar to them all : " This fucking van , where in hell do you expect a person to park ? " And there is Jill , her pale-blonde hair short and sleek , a small cap , a helmet . Jill , in pale-pink silk , looking slightly rumpled , and flustered  --  and , as Ralph has , said , very sexy . " I thought I left plenty of room . You do look fabulous , Jill . " Hurry up . We 're just starting , my kids will eat it all up if we do n't . " " Where on earth have you been ? " Thus more or less in chorus is Jill greeted by her sisters . She chooses , though , to answer only Sage 's somewhat accusing question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tells Sage , and then , " Where 's Noel ? He 's working too ? " She laughs again , and seems not to expect an answer . " I will have a glass of wine , " she tells Ralph . " It all seems so festive , I feel rather festive myself . " As though deliberately , the three blonde daughters have clustered together , Liza , Fiona , and Jill , all happily out in the sunshine , in their summer clothes , with plates of summer food before them . Sage , isolating herself somewhat , chooses a shaded corner of the deck , near a budding yellow rose . Caroline is moved to go over to her , though not to say what is most in her mind , not to say , You 're worried over Noel , you should n't be , he 's just not worth it . Although that is what she would have liked to say . And Caroline sighs , with the further self-critical observation , How much a mother I do seem still to be ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else with my life . To Sage , though , what she does say is , " How 's your wo rk going these days ? Do I get to come to your studio any time soon ? "
