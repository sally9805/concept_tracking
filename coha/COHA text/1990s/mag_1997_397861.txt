Eeny , Meeny , Miney , Mo ' Colors on Screen I HAVE A 486 with the graphics adapter built into the system board . I want to use a program that requires VGA graphics , but when I try to open it while using Windows 3.11 's generic 16-color VGA driver , the program refuses , complaining that it requires 256 colors . I 'm sure the adapter must support 256 colors . I 've tried just about every 640-by-480 256-color driver I can find , to no avail . How do I find the right driver ? Anthony F. Wright , Internet AS YOU DISCOVERED , just picking drivers at random does n't work . Your best bet is to try to deduce exactly which video controller chip you have , then install the right driver for it . The easiest way to do this is to turn off the computer , then turn it back on . The first thing you should see on your screen , even before the BIOS version information shows up , is a message displayed by the video BIOS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the exact chip model . Armed with that knowledge , you can try to track down a Windows 3.1 driver for that specific video adapter ( usually available from the adapter manufacturer ) or a generic driver for the chip ( sometimes available from Microsoft or the chip manufacturer ) . If this information does n't appear on the screen-or flashes by too quickly-you can also open the computer and inspect the system board . Most video controller chips are labeled . If you ca n't determine the chip manufacturer , try installing Microsoft 's generic SVGA ( 640 x 480 x 256 ) driver , available online at Microsoft 's FTP server ( ftp.microsoft . **29;0;TOOLONG ) . BLAME IT ON THE CD-ROM , OR ON THE DRIVE ? I HAVE TWO new CD-ROM basedprograms that seem to be incompatible with my CD-ROM drive . I can insert the discs in the drive and even get a directory listing of their contents , but I ca n't install or run the programs listed . Windows just keeps telling me there is no disc in the drive . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered replacement discs from the manufacturer , but they do n't work either . Is it my circa-1991 CD-ROM drive , or the discs ? Phillips H. Fox , Port Lavaca , Texas YOU 'lL NEED TO pop them into another CD-ROM drive to find out for sure , but it 's possible that the problem is in the CDROM disc . Your relatively ancient drive may have a hard time reading higher-density ( 74-minute ) CD-ROMs or discs that mix audio and data tracks or contain a zero track . I 've also read reports of people having difficulty reading CD-ROMs formatted using Microsoft 's Joliet CD-ROM file system . Joliet extends the standard ISO 966o CD-ROM file system to support Windows gs-style long file names . If the CD-ROM drive 's contents include file names longer than 8 plus 3 characters , this could be your problem . On a related note , it 's also very likely your drive will have trouble reading CD-Recordable discs ( identifiable by their gold color ) . Having said all that , it 's much more likely that your drive is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read data from the CDROM has a lens that may have accumulated dust and other crud since it got its start back in the Bush Administration . Before you explore more expensive solutions , consider buying a CD lens cleaner at your local computer store . They usually cost less than $20 , and consist of a disc fitted with gentle brushes that you pop into the drive for a minute or so . A coworker might even have one you can borrow . If cleaning does no good , and the CDROM itself does n't appear to be the problem , the prognosis goes from bad to worse . The drive 's laser or motor is probably on its last legs , in which case your best move is to replace it . But this news is n't so bad-newer , speedier , and more capable drives are inexpensive . REGISTRY REPAIR 101 WHENEVER I START Windows 95,1 see a " Registry Error " message , after which Windows asks me to click an OK button so that it can repair the Registry from a backup copy . Windows then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on I get the same error . Ketan Patel , Rutherford , New Jersey NOTHING IS EASIER to mangle , and harder to fix , than the Windows Registry . Each time Windows 95 starts up , it creates backup copies of the Registry 's system.dat and user.dat files . If the Registry becomes damaged , Windows 95 will try using the backup copies . Unfortunately , through the wonders of technology , it is possible for both copies of the files to become corrupted , which sounds like your situation . // Speed Office 97 by Turning Off File Logging // Until recently , Registry repair tools have been pretty much nonexistent . I recommend that you try Helix Software 's Nuts &; Bolts system maintenance utility ; it 's not guaranteed to solve your problem , but it may help . In addition to disk management , crash-proofing , and security tools similar to those in Symantec 's Norton Utilities , Nuts &; Bolts offers a nice Registry repair tool that could get you booting smoothly again ( see the figure on the next page ) . So does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do the job , here 's a last-ditch tactic . It 's based on a file called system.ist , which is a copy of your Registry from the day you first installed Windows 95 ; you may have to reinstall hardware that you added after the initial Win 95 installation . 1 . To remove the hidden , system , and read-only attributes of the file called system.ist in your computer 's root directory , type the command attrib -h -s -r system.lst in a DOS window . Then copy system.ist to your Windows directory ( the command copy c : system.lst c : windows should do it , unless Windows 95 is installed in a different drive or directory ) . 2 . Remove the hidden , system , and readonly attributes of the system.dat file by using this DOS command : attrib -h -s -r system.dat. 3 . Delete system.dat , then rename system.ist to system.dat and reset the attributes using attrib +h +s +r . When you restart Windows , you wo n't get the error message .

READER SERVICE NO. 618 SPEED WINDOWS 95 STARTUP HERE 'S A TIP that can save you time and money . After a couple of years of installing and uninstalling programs and peripherals , you may notice that it 's taking longer to start up and shut down Windows 95 . The problem is that hardware and software uninstall routines do n't always clean up after themselves . As a result , Win 95 's Registry gets bloated . Starting up and shutting down both involve reading and writing the Registry files ( and their backups ) , which contributes to the slowdown . Helix 's Nuts &; Bolts does a great job of optimizing the Registry , but at a price ( see preceding item ) . If you just need a light sprucing up , try Microsoft 's free RegClean 4.1 . This utility removes unused or corrupted Registry keys created by apps that use OLE automation . If your Registry is bogged down with such entries , download RegClean from Microsoft 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF A PROGRAM I recently installed several programs that launch automatically when Windows 95 starts up . I did n't care for them , and deleted them from the hard drive . Unfortunately , Windows 95 still tries to launch the programs when it starts up , and posts an error message I have to click on in order to proceed . How can I prevent Windows from searching for these nonexistent applications ? Chris Brunner , Springfield , Missouri anD USER ! Instead of using the programs ' own uninstall features , which should delete files , and remove Registry entries and other settings , you just went in there and deleted the program files . With Windows 95 , such straightforwardness can land you in trouble . First , look for and delete a Shortcut to the program in your StartUp menu . To delete StartUp menu items , right click the Taskbar , select Properties , select the Start Menu Programs tab , click the Remove button , and select the program you want to delete . Click Close , then click OK . Next , select Start*Settings*Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Install/Uninstall tab , and look for the troublesome program in the listing in the bottom half of the window . Assuming you have n't already deleted the files necessary for uninstalling the application , just double-clicking the program 's entry in the list should remove do the trick . If this does n't remove the program , open the win.ini file ( located in the Windows directory ) in Notepad . Look for load= and run= commands near the top of the file-anything listed after these commands will run automatically when you start Windows . Remove the offending apps if you can identify them , or place a semicolon in front of the suspect lines to prevent everything on the line from loading . Save the file and exit Notepad. // UNTANGLE Reqistry snags with Helix Software 's powerful Nuts &; Bolts utility . // If none of the above solves your problem , the program probably launches via a Windows 95 Registry entry . You might be able to find and delete the entry using Windows ' Registry editor , but that could be frustrating . If you still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simply reinstall the program and then use its own uninstall utility . You 'll probably find a Shortcut to the uninstall tool in the program 's Start button submenu ; occasionally , you 'll find the uninstall tool only on the installation CD-ROM or floppy . And , just to make it extra easy on you , some programs ( such as Microsoft Office ) bury their uninstall routines in the install program .
