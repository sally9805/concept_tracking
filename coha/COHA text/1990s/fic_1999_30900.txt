From Chapter Four Esperanza walked through town toward her house . The house had stood for over two hundred years silently witnessing the lives of her family 's generations . Many layers of paint covered it . These days bright egg yolk yellow bounced off the walls . Bougainvillea pink lines ran along the borders of every opening , embracing the old door and covering the bottom half wall . Cobalt blue wrought-iron posts guarded the windows , anticipating the very unlikely possibility of a break-in . Luis had picked those colors before he was killed in the bus accident . Esperanza had it painted the way he wanted and kept it like that for more than twelve years , missing him more every day , reading his letters over and over and saving them in a tin marzipan candy box under her bed , along with newspaper clippings from the accident , his wedding ring , his wisdom tooth , a few strands of his hair  --  stiff and glued together with a dry blotch of green paint  --  and a key chain with their photo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the Virgen de Guadalupe in Mexico City . A reasonable , prudent time after Luis ' death , six men came forward all at once and claimed to love Esperanza . They wished they could caress her long black hair and hold her close for at least one century . The first one hoped to marry her and give her three boys so she could be safe and taken care of in her old age . The boys would become doctors , lawyers , or engineers , if that 's what it took to make her love him . The second man 's desire was to build her a modern house with air-conditioning and paint it with the colors she liked best and then make love to her in every one of the rooms , every day of the week at different hours of the day , so sunlight could reflect on the colored walls and bounce back on their skins , making them blue , then green , then orange . The third man belonged to the wealthiest family in town . He owned a sugar cane factory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped her lips to be . He admired the way she sometimes held them open a tiny bit in a hint of a smile , revealing her straight , resplendent white teeth . The fourth man , a Mexico City native , threatened to kill himself if Esperanza did n't pay attention to him . He followed her to church every Sunday for eight months , attracted mainly by the way her hips swayed like a boat when she walked . The fifth man wanted to feel her large , firm breasts pressed against his chest and was known to sleep every night holding a pillow as if it were Esperanza . He made the mistake of telling this to his barber , who in turn told the rest of his clients , sending the gossip all the way to the neighboring town of Alvarado . Often he would be asked at social gatherings , " And how 's Mrs. Pillow ? " The sixth man , a sailor , wanted to take her on a trip around the world . His plan was to stop at every island and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at them and die of envy after realizing what they missed for not being human . But in the end , except for the fourth man , who was ultimately locked up in a mental hospital , they all had to marry other women , so tired had they become of waiting for Esperanza to even greet them on the street . I could n't love any of those men , " she told Soledad once while walking home from the market . " God gave me my chance with Luis . Too bad it did n't last long . I 'll just be a widow and that 's that . " Luis fell in love with Esperanza at eight-fifteen in the morning on the first day of tenth grade when she walked into the classroom . He could n't help but notice her hair , long and a bit wavy , like the river water on a windy afternoon . And just looking at it hanging loosely down her shoulders and over her back made him lightheaded . He saw her scan the room in search of an empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third row . Another empty desk was next to him . Had n't she seen it ? Why was she sitting so far away ? Had she caught him staring at her ? Had she seen him break out in a sweat the minute she walked in ? Could she have noticed the pimple on his nose ? Maybe she did n't want to sit next to him , the new kid in the classroom . Luis had been unabashedly happy since preschool , but on that day , he silently admitted to himself that he had wasted sixteen years of his life , which meant all of it . Why had God sent him to earth so long before he saw that girl ? He thought of the millions of minutes wasted with his friends at the Alvarado wharf talking about girls they 'd like to go to bed with , walking younger girls home from school and imagining them naked , posting magazine cutouts of teen beauties behind his closet door and masturbating on mosquito-infested nights . Suddenly , every woman he knew became small , insignificant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third row . Esperanza did n't notice Luis until recess , at ten-thirty . He sat at the far end of the schoolyard , protected by the shade of a generous mango tree . The heat was oppressive . The sun was cruel . He drank a tamarind soda straight from the bottle and offered Esperanza a sip with a wordless gesture that she understood clear across the yard . And since she just had to get a closer look at his smile , she walked over and sat by him until the bell rang , fifteen minutes later . They exchanged names . They laughed for no particular reason . They shared the tamarind soda . By day 's end , they had already written each other notes that went from hand to hand across the classroom . He wrote : " Life has been senseless until today . Let 's make up for the time we have n't been together . " She answered : " Come for dinner with my parents at eight o'clock . " From that evening until years later when Luis was killed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together was worth three . They loved each other with hurried passion . Their kisses did not have the taste of eternity . It was during those days that Esperanza 's skin began developing a tamarind-candy flavor . Bitter , sweet , sour , and salty , all at the same time . Her flesh was like a planet with one harmonious nation . A luscious fruition for Luis ' taste buds . A sacred shrine for mosquitoes . A potential threat to those with weak stomachs . Every night , he spent one hour licking her , starting behind her ear and ending between her toes . After his death , his pictures , framed in wood , silver , pewter , plastic , and bamboo , hung from the walls , stood on the bookshelf , on the kitchen table , by her bed , and at the door . Every day , Esperanza spent a few seconds looking at each one and wondering how she would get by in his absence . She kept herself busy making sure the accounting books were up to date at the hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visiting her parents and Luis at the cemetery . And then there was little Blanca to care for . She was born a very small baby , two months before her due date , would never be held in her father 's arms . And in fact , during her first four weeks of life , it was mainly Luis who held her . If anyone else picked her up from her crib , she 'd cry tears the size of an adult 's . Esperanza came to think her baby did n't love her , but Blanca was just getting the most attention she could from a father she would not have for long . As soon as Luis died , Blanca 's crying stopped and Esperanza 's began . The door of Esperanza 's house was stubborn at times and refused to open . But she found a way to jiggle her key in the old lock until it gave in . She amused herself thinking she tickled it with the key and that the squeaking sound the door made when it opened was its laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esperanza on the patio . She sounded concerned . A habit of hers . " The Espinozas came by to express their condolences . " " I went to see Father Salvador . I told him all about Blanca . " Esperanza whimpered on Soledad 's shoulder , tired of crying so much those past few days . Soledad squeezed a couple of little tears out . They seemed petty , almost inadequate , but to Esperanza those tears meant that her friend was finally allowing herself to be vulnerable . " I should n't be crying in front of you , " said Soledad . " It 's fine . You do n't always have to be strong . " They exchanged handkerchiefs and dried each other 's tears . " You 're as hard as an oak tree , Soledad . Ca n't you just break down once for me ? " " I am breaking down . " Soledad wiped a single tear off her cheek and smeared it on Esperanza 's palm . " See ? " Esperanza knew Soledad cried inconsolably at certain moments during her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tragedies , she would always act as if she could take anything . At her husband 's funeral , she was the only one who did not cry , at least in public . Because of that , many people believed that Soledad had never really loved Alfredo , that she had married him just because he resembled the late Mexican movie idol Pedro Infante . This gossip went on for a few years , until one day , while ordering a birthday cake for Blanca at the bakery , Esperanza overheard two women talking about the issue . She took two meringue cupcakes topped with whipped cream from the counter , paid for them , and once given the change , smashed them on the women 's heads . From then on , the gossip focused on Esperanza 's temper . And it did n't stop until Esperanza tied a coin to the mouth of San Ramn Nonato , always called on for protection against people talking behind one 's back . She fastened the coin to the saint 's statue with a red ribbon , passing the ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck . Soledad and Esperanza tiptoed across the patio , so as not to wake her grandfather 's hydrangea sleeping in terra-cotta pots and old motor fuel oil cans . Hundreds of containers  --  tin , plastic , majolica , wood , cement  --  were carefully arranged in groups all over the brick floor and around the magnolia tree . The women knew well where to set their feet as they walked in the semidarkness toward the door at the end of the cluttered patio . As they settled themselves in the living room , a major drama involving two angry , handsome men developed before their eyes on the TV set , but they did not pay attention . " What are we going to do with so much pain ? " Soledad 's voice was brittle . " If it keeps growing it wo n't fit in our bodies anymore . " " The worst part is that we 're crying for no reason . " Esperanza was blunt . " Blanca is not dead . " This was the first of many times when Soledad would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's death was a fact as clear and tangible as the funeral itself . She had signed the death certificate as a witness , she had seen the casket being covered with dirt at the cemetery , and she had prayed for Blanca 's soul along with the sixty or so other people who attended the service . Clearly , the next step was to mourn her , accept the fact with resignation , and move on . " San Judas Tadeo told me . " Esperanza bit her lip . " In person . " She bit it again . How could she be saying this ? She had promised Father Salvador to keep the miracle to herself . " For God 's sake , Esperanza . Do n't go crazy on me . " Their conversation became tangled with the one coming from the soap opera on TV , a braid of words overlapping one another , trying to make sense . " I never thought that my own partner would back stab me this way . Those signed checks were blank and you knew it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearts ! " said one of the well-groomed men on the TV screen . " You do n't believe me . " Esperanza realized then why Father Salvador had asked her to keep the apparition a secret . " She set the amount on those checks ! Forget about your daughter , Jos Fernando , she 's mine from now on , body , soul , and bank accounts ! " A younger man , more handsome , his mustache a bit uneven , yelled in a closeup almost too big for the screen . Esperanza did n't wait for the other man to answer . She stood up , turned the TV off , and walked away from Soledad . I just want everything to be the way it was before we lost Blanca , " she said at the door , leaving Soledad alone in the living room . A very large living room , it seemed to Soledad . The whole house had suddenly become a big empty place . The kitchen , the bedrooms , the dining room , all were now filled with heat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hallway was silent , devoid of Blanca 's laughter . Chairs and armoires and tables had lost their purpose . She felt she did n't belong in Esperanza 's house anymore . With the girl gone , she no longer had a reason to live there . Blanca did n't need her . Souls that live with God do n't need little dressmaking godmothers . But if Esperanza was losing her mind , she would have to stay and take care of her . Soledad dragged the rocking chair to the portico and sat , staring at the street as if something interesting might happen . She , too , wanted everything to be the way it had been when Blanca was around . Just a few months before , she had begun making her a Jarocha costume . In her lifetime she had made dozens of those elaborate dresses for the most beautiful girls and women in Tlacotalpan to wear at their Quince Aos dances and Candelaria festivities . But her goddaughter 's dress had to be special . Far more embroidery would be involved . Imported satin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her mother and her grandmother . The shoes , brought in from the city . During the last fitting , a couple of weeks before Blanca died , Soledad enveloped her tender preteen body with the white fabric , making her look like a child angel surrounded by voluptuous clouds . She remembered Blanca in the dress , halfway made , pins sticking out everywhere , wearing a tiny bra that bashfully covered breasts the size of mosquito bites . Even at that ungraceful age , not yet a woman , and no longer a girl , Blanca was pretty . Her body was beginning to swell in the places men crave the most . Her hair , long and black , like the wings of a magpie , fell over her bare shoulders . This was a girl who would not suffer from acne , would not need braces , would not gain weight , would not smoke or follow teenage fads , and still , one whom all her friends at school would love and envy . Not only that , had she not disappeared , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she not ? She had the undivided attention and care of two mothers . She pleased Soledad by wearing the costumes she made for her . She stood patiently through the fittings . She participated in every parade that Soledad asked her to . And she kissed and hugged Esperanza , always clinging to her like a barnacle to the stilts of a dock . Every morning , Esperanza and Soledad took turns writing notes to put in Blanca 's lunch bag . When the juice of this mango drips down your arm , think of how much I love you . Blanca collected every note in an envelope she kept in the diary she hid under her mattress . When Esperanza began sorting through her daughter 's things after the funeral , she found the diary . She cried so much that the tears blurred her vision . She had to wait two weeks before she could read a word , but once she started , she read the entire thing in one sitting . Under other circumstances , she would not have violated Blanca 's privacy . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracing the handwriting with her finger . She cherished the roundness of the o 's , the firmness of the t 's , and how the a 's at the end of words curved the serif upward , almost touching the line above . Esperanza kissed nearly every word in the diary , even those that were misspelled , then put the diary back in its place . On Tuesdays and Fridays , after school , Blanca had practiced guitar with her teacher , Don Remigio Montao , a retired mariachi who helped her develop a passion for music . Before she was even seven years old she had already learned to play and sing a couple of boleros , without really understanding what the sad , heartbroken lyrics meant . Her little voice filled the house , floated out the window , and blended with the street noises , making the sound of a truck passing by not only bearable but harmonious . But now she was gone . Now Soledad would have to finish the dress for someone else , the sixteen-year-old daughter of one of Soledad 's cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being chased by her boyfriend in a sugarcane field , ultimately surrendering and making love with him in the mud . While Soledad rocked mechanically on the chair in the portico , Esperanza sat inside , on Blanca 's bed . She was angry at Soledad for not believing in San Judas Tadeo 's apparition . And by not believing , Soledad 's life after Blanca 's disappearance had become one of grief , acceptance , and resignation , as if the girl were really dead . With the palm of her hand , Esperanza ironed a crease on the bedspread and remembered how she had cleaned Blanca 's room meticulously before she went to pick her up at the hospital . She had placed half a dozen white roses in a crystal vase and had set it on her night table , right next to a picture of Luis in a small silver frame . With respect , she had lit a brand-new candle , the kind that smelled like roses . She had pulled the sheets open , folding them out in a perfect triangle , and fluffed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room , cooling off her sweaty face with a paper fan , minimizing the effects of the heatwave and an early menopause . She had hung the Jarocha costume from the rod by the window and fixed the flounces and frills . In four more months she would finish the embroidery along the sleeves and on the apron . But the rest of the dress was almost completed . She had planned it so that it could grow with Blanca , leaving enough fabric along the hem to let out as needed . This way , she could wear it to her Quince Aos dance three years from now . Esperanza and Soledad had made sure every stitch was in the right place . They imagined the girl in it , dancing with the most handsome boy in town , waving the spacious white skirt like a storm at sea and making him dizzy from glimpses of her legs during the split seconds the skirt was up . Blanca 's clothes were still in the armoire . Her shoes were under her bed . Her dolls were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not wear it . She would not make any boy dizzy from desire . She would not be kissed or adored . She would not marry or have children . Unless Esperanza found her .
