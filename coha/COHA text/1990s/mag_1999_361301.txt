From the day Karen Katz brought her infant daughter Lena home , there was a certain question she knew was coming . It finally came when Lena was four ; she turned to her mother and asked , " Mommy , how come I 'm not the same color as you ? " Her heart stopped . Then Katz , who is white , explained to her cinnamon-skinned , Guatemalan-born daughter that they came from different countries . Over the years , Katz and her husband Gary Richards have consciously worked to minimize the distance between themselves and their daughter : taking a trip to Mexico to surround Lena , now eight , with people who look like her and choosing to live in a polyglot Manhattan neighborhood where she blends in easily . Nonetheless , Lena sometimes seems to reject her dark skin , crying over her inability to match her parents . But recently she 's begun to explain proudly to strangers her adopted status . " Which is n't to say we 're home free now , " says Katz . " It 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in an increasing number of American households that have been made multiracial through either intermarriage or transracial adoption . The Census Bureau estimates that there are more than 1.3 million interracial marriages . Nearly a third of the children adopted from the public foster-care system are placed with families of a different race . And in the past decade , the number of children adopted from China , for example , has jumped from less than 200 to more than 4,000 . You see it even in Hollywood , where Steven Spielberg , Tom Cruise and Michelle Pfeiffer are parents of adopted nonwhite children . <P> And like Katz , more and more parents are wrangling with tough questions : how to handle the external aspects  --  the stares , comments and other public behaviors that arise when families look different  --  and perhaps more important , how to handle the internal  --  the need to affirm the family bond while helping a child craft a strong racial sense of self . <P> DEALING WITH INSENSITIVITY <P> The spectrum of multiracial families is broad but embraces some common issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choices of neighborhoods , schools , play groups or other social situations when they have a mixed household . " For a child , it 's easier to blend , " says Mary Durr , an executive with the Adoption Services Information Agency in Washington . She and other experts suggest searching out racially diverse communities  --  much as Susan Weiss , a Chicago social worker , had to do after acknowledging the negative racial remarks to which her adopted daughters , Indian-born Cathryn , 12 , and Peruvian-born Amanda , 7 , were subjected in the city . The family moved to a more mixed neighborhood in Oak Park , where , says Weiss , " there are so many parents and kids that do n't ' match ' that no one notices . " <P> Despite such efforts to create a comforting environment , a trip to the supermarket or McDonald 's can be fraught with insensitive public behavior . People stare , children taunt , strangers ask rude questions . To be constantly asked , " Are you just the baby-sitter ? " or " Do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say those who have endured such questioning . " Some days I want to scream out ... ' Leave us alone . My life is none of your business !
