I 've always taken sinister delight in the line from Bobby Darin 's classic tune " Mack the Knife " about the shark having such pretty teeth , dear . That the shark keeps them pearly white is good stuff , too , both for the fierce imagery it conjures up and , in a practical sense , for anyone crafting the fish 's distinctive dental work into nautical baubles . Which is exactly what Gloria Patience does after she 's conquered the beasts with the ivory teeth . On one such occasion , though , the item most noticeably pearly white was Gloria 's blood-drained face . Anchored in 250 feet of water , fishing down 1,500 feet at the edge of the continental shelf off Exuma , Bahamas , she and her brother were handlining red snappers . They 'd been at it successfully for a while , and the cobalt-blue water was rich with bait and scent , and probably a little blood . That 's when a middling-size mako shark , about seven feet long , exploded through the silky slick surface and smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck unconscious . Gloria pitched over the side of her Boston Whaler in the continuing pandemonium . The free-jumping shark then disappeared . " I taught my butt to walk on water in the next two seconds , " says Gloria , affectionately known around Exuma as The Shark Lady . " The nearest thing was the boat 's bow . Never thought I could climb over it , but I scurried right up like a damned crab . " That was some years ago . Her brother still has neck problems . But Gloria 's battle-seasoned 13-foot Whaler , The Nut Cracker , tooth-scarred and once stolen , is none the worse for the wear in the shark-catching trade . The same goes for Gloria Patience . She may not fish as often these days , but that 's OK . A cadre of international pals  --  adventurers , artists , scientific types  --  donate the odd tooth-studded jaw or shark vertebrae , which she pieces-down into necklaces and bracelets . When she does go in pursuit of sharks , Gloria takes a local boat boy with her now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's her only concession to the years . At 77 , she handles a 60-pound grapnel with little more effort than a flower pot , and you would not want to challenge her to a quick bout of arm wrestling . Four of her nine children , moved in recent years back to Great Exuma Island , constantly worry over her . " They call me up , tell me I should n't be chasing sharks , running the damn boat at my age . But I have confidence in my abilities , my dear . If I want to get up and wiggle my butt she does so , or dance with a drink on my head she does this also , without spilling a drop , I will . " We are just now at a beach house party on Little Exuma , and Gloria 's demonstrations are eye-catching . The explosive yellow of her dress is echoed by the gold necklace and ring she wears against deeply , permanently tanned skin , a mockery of conventional wisdom  --  as is her style  --  about the terrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles and thread between her first two toes , forming faux sandal thongs . She wears no shoes . Never . Not here , not on the mainland nor on the streets of London . " Not for the Queen  --  even if I had been invited for tea , which I was n't when I visited there , " she says . She fluffs her short silver hair and refocuses those bright , flinty blue eyes that click from mirthful to icicle sharp when the talk slides over to sharks . For The Shark Lady there is no dark preoccupation with the predators themselves , the infinite brute power of them as nature 's ultimate instruments of dissolution . No pathological Captain Quint-like thirst for revenge . No delicious titillative fear of being devoured alive . No thrill for the piston-thump of the 18-inch-barrel marine shotgun ( used to quiet the sharks ) and its spawn of havoc . Shark collecting to Gloria is the same today as when she was a young girl : utilitarian , a way to make a living , with the added bonus of extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of establishing equal footing with male siblings . " My father showed me  --  once  --  how to wade out from the beach with a home-woven line made of silvertops palmettos and a brass hook he 'd made and baited with a fish head . I learned to tie the line to a buttonwood tree to help me fight the sharks . " That 's how I made my money as a girl . I skinned my sharks and sold the salted skin to the Ocean Leather Company still going strong in Newark , New Jersey . I used to call myself an adventuress until I looked it up . Honest to God , it means a woman who uses men to get what she wants . I should have used ' adventurer . ' I wanted to do everything my father and brothers did . " The Shark Lady did just about that . Straight out of the chute she needed no Equal Rights Amendment for common ground in the true dark ages of male jingoism . Equality Gloria grabbed by the , ahem , ears and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect and love of men from an odd mixture of worlds that spanned academic , military , art and sports disciplines . growing up on her Scots-Irish parents ' farm on Hog Cay south Exuma , she ran the hills like a colt told the world what she was not about early on . " At age 3 I was kicked out of my first school for beating up a guy and throwing him into a prickly pear tree . They sent me to Sacred Heart school in Nassau where I lasted six months and was booted out at age 4-1/2 . My father brought me back to Hog Cay where he had hired a tutor I would n't listen to . I learned to read and write from a book called the Mavis Spelling Book . I can not be taught , I have to do it myself . " Her approach to sharks is the same . This is handline stuff . Then again , forget line . She uses 150 feet of braided polyester rope ; who knows how strong . To the rope is shackled a six-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than a big man 's foot . A whole grouper head is impaled from the top , the hook point emerging below the jaw . The rig is dropped , the boat moved and anchored so that the line is tight . Sharks up to 10 feet long Gloria simply hauls in . The Shark Lady says she can tell instantly the size of the beasts and you do n't doubt it ; not from someone who can feel the brush of a red snapper against her baited line 1,500 or 2,000 feet down . Big things more than 10 feet get the treatment . With the hooked shark going away , Gloria grabs the line and deftly knots to it a short rope attached to a preassembled buoy rig . From the buoy streams an additional 30 to 40 feet of rope tied to a 60-pound grapnel anchor . She heaves the whole works overboard . The rig is now free of the boat . She has yet to hook a shark that has trucked off with her gear . Does she let the creature get the grapnel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the fruit of my labor ? Oh no , my dear . I go right to it and haul his tail up . It 's a neat system . " Alongside The Nut Cracker 's gunnels , Gloria 's methods have come full circle . There was a time when she owned a bang stick that made things simple . " It got their attention ; it put a four-inch hole in their heads . But someone stole the thing and now I 'm back to tying the suckers up . " Which means that , to the amazement of most shark sport fishermen , Gloria snout-ties and tail-ties her 10-foot-and-less catches , heaving them aboard and lashing them down . The bigger fellows are likewise trussed but towed to a nearby beach . She is fastidious about cleaning her catch . Dragging a shark up the sand , its tail is severed , no blood going back into the water . " In no time he 's gone , " she says . " It 's the quickest way . " The back vertebrae and teeth are removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is nothing wasted . In 1934 , when Gloria was 16 , architect and civil engineer James Lewless anchored at Hog Cay on an intended round-the-world cruise . " We fell in love , " she says . " I married my first boyfriend . We raised nine children and lived in Nassau where his business was . " They were married 27 years , the last 10 of which James , quite considerably her senior , was ill . Gloria turned to other professions to support the family . In her self-taught way , she became a physiotherapist , masseuse and nurse , sometimes working 18-hour days . She 's lived with her second husband , George Patience , for 33 years . Moving back to Exuma in 1970 ; she transformed the old post office into a cottage , naming it " Tara " ostensibly after the O'Hara homestead in Gone With The Wind , but perhaps subliminally for its original reference to the home of ancient Irish kings . " I 've always been a romantic , " she tells you . But that truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing her childhood waters around Exuma intimately , and finding a ready market with no competition , she began supplying local resorts with fresh fish , handlining 300 pounds of snappers in a morning and simultaneously rekindling her old relationship with sharks . That relationship became all-consuming . The shark-fighting grandmother 's exploits were soon bannered from such widely ranging publications as London 's Tattler tabloid and National Geographic magazine . She has appeared in books , prestigious travel periodicals and on " The American Sportsman " television series . She became pals with Jaws author Peter Benchley and a varied cast of visiting sports figures and writers . For R &; R she competitively captained a sailing dinghy with a crew of topless women until a rules committee disallowed the team for unfair diversionary tactics . with sharks , though , Gloria now takes a self-described diplomatic approach . The predators are hunted in channels and in the mouths of creeks back into the mangroves rather than in the open ocean . She refuses to fish in darkness . Her boat is stocked with water , rations and emergency equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whaler because of equipment failure . Such inconveniences and inherent risks of the game she accepts almost cavalierly . She has never considered herself in peril , although there was the thing with the tiger sharks once . Gloria had trussed a l0-foot male tiger to the boat . Some tattered bait remained on the hook , which was thrown back in . " Male tigers are the only shark that lacerate the females with their teeth before they mate , and that 's what must have been going on , " says Gloria . " We suddenly hooked up again . It was a nine-foot female , her body cut from head to tail . She must have been in a terrible mood from it because she charged the boat and grabbed the gunnel in her jaws . We had to pry her off . The front row of teeth was left in the fiberglass . We got her , though . " the excitement resounds in her voice as she remembers other big fish , and her largest of all : " I had a mean seven-foot lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and swallowed it  --  all except for the head . She came again , a tiger , 18 feet of her , and took the head and was hooked . When I finally beat her she was too big to tow in and I had to kill her there . She had that lemon shark in her stomach plus a hundred-pound turtle . " Gloria 's eyes affect that characteristic flinty-sharp stare as she connects past remembrances with present-day experience . Her enthusiasm continues . " The other day we were fishing a creek for grunts and snappers and there were five lemon sharks there , one of them pretty big . They took some of our fish , our larger fish . I did n't have my shark gear or I would have got them . I still know every worthwhile fishing drop around here , my dear  --  for dinner fish or for sharks  --  and I can run right to them without any fancy equipment . I take my bearings and I know exactly where I 'm going . " No one would doubt it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
