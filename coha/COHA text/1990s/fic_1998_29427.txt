The Lisbon plane soared away from the dense , swirling fog of Casablanca , up and into the night . Below , the airport was plunged deep into the North African darkness , its only illumination the revolving beacon that perched atop the conning tower . The sirens of the French colonial police cars had faded into the night . Everything was quiet but the wind . Almost lost in the mist , two men were walking together , away from the airport , away from the city , and into an uncertain future . " ... of a beautiful friendship , " said Richard Blaine , tugging on a cigarette as he walked . His hat was pulled down low on his forehead , and his trench coat was cinched tightly against the damp . Rick felt calmer than he had in years . In fact , he tried to remember when he had felt this certain of what he had just done , and what he was about to do . The shorter man walking beside him nodded . " Well , my friend , Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Louis Renault . " I might have known you 'd mix your newfound patriotism with a little larceny . " He fished in his pocket and came up with ten thousand francs . " That must have been very difficult for you , Ricky , " he said . " Miss Lund is an extremely beautiful woman . I do n't know that I should have been so gallant , even with money at stake . " " I guess that 's the difference between me and you , Louie , " Rick replied . Ilsa Lund ! Had it been only two days ago that she had walked back into his life ? It seemed like a year . How could a woman change a man 's fate so much so fast ? Now his duty was to follow that fate , no matter where it might lead him . " Anyway , you were gallant enough not to have me arrested , even though I 'd just given the letters of transit to the most wanted man in the Third Reich and shot a Gestapo officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting ready to face a firing squad . Why the sudden change of heart ? I never let you win that much at roulette . " The little man , smart and well turned out in his black colonial policeman 's uniform , trod so softly beside Rick Blaine that even in the stillness his footfalls were inaudible . Over the years , Louis Renault had found it preferable to leave as little a mark on his surroundings as possible . " I do n't know , " Renault replied . " Maybe it 's because I like you . Maybe it 's because I did n't like the late Heinrich Strasser . Maybe it 's because you 've cheated me out of the favors of two lovely ladies who were in dire need of my services in obtaining exit visas , and I insist on proper retribution . Maybe it 's because you won our bet , and I 'd like a chance to get my money back . " " And maybe it 's because you 're cheap , " said Rick . " What difference does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finished his cigarette and sent the glowing butt sparking across the tarmac . He searched the sky , but her plane was long gone . " So did I. " Abruptly , Renault halted and grabbed Rick by the arm . " I was right : you are a rank sentimentalist , " he exclaimed . " You 're still in love with her , are n't you ? " " Why do n't you mind your own business ? " retorted Rick . " This is my business -- indeed , my two favorite businesses : money and women , " answered Renault . " A less charitable man than I might claim he 'd been cheated . You knew all along that you were going to give those letters of transit to Victor Laszlo and his wife . I would n't be at all surprised if the lady knew it , too . " " It 's hard to know what women know , is n't it ? " Rick replied , starting to walk again and picking up the pace . " It 's even harder to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking them deeper into the darkness . " Where are we going , if you do n't mind my asking ? " asked Renault . His complicity in the death of Major Strasser was so spontaneous that he had little more than the clothes on his back and the francs in his wallet . He hoped his friend knew what he was doing . " If we really want to go to the Free French garrison at Brazzaville , we 'd better think about commandeering a transport flight out before the Germans wake up . It 's a long way to the Congo -- three thousand miles , at least . " Rick scuffed the ground with his shoe . " Forget Brazzaville . I 've got a better use for your money . " His eyes stabbed the darkness . There it was ! In the distance , he could make out the dimly defined shape of a large automobile parked at the far end of the airfield . Sacha and Sam , right in place and right on time . Louis nodded appreciatively as Rick 's Buick 81C convertible came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoothed down his dark uniform . In Renault 's opinion , to look anything other than one 's best ill suited a Frenchman . Especially a newly Free Frenchman . Especially a really free Frenchman . " You leave nothing to chance , do you ? Tell me , did you plan to kill Major Strasser all along , or was that just inspired improvisation ? " " Let 's just say I got lucky when he drew first , " replied Rick , opening the automobile 's back door and climbing in . " Where did you learn to handle a gun like that , if you do n't mind my asking ? One might think you had some wartime experience . " " I was in a lot of little wars around New York , " said Rick . " You were n't really going to shoot me back there , were you , Ricky ? " " Not if you did n't make me , " replied Rick . " I try not to make a habit of killing my friends . I do n't always succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam inquired anxiously from the driver 's seat . " Everything 's just ducky , " said Rick . " Now step on it . We 've got to make Port Lyautey before daybreak . " " Right , boss , " said Sam , and floored it . Port Lyautey , north of Rabat , was about two hundred miles away . Founded by the French in 1912 when they established the protectorate , the city on the Sebou River was a major transportation hub , with a seaport at Mehdia , a railroad , and , best of all , an airfield . Come hell or high water , they were going to follow Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund to Lisbon . Unfortunately , each and every one of those two hundred miles was bad road . Well , that 's why God built Buicks and charged so much for them , thought Rick : shipped over from the States and smuggled into Casablanca , his had cost more than $2,000 . Sam Waters hit the accelerator so hard , Rick and Louis were thrust back into the leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the front passenger seat , Sacha Yurchenko laughed and fondled the .38 Smith &; Wesson that Rick had given him as a bonus the year before . " You want I should shoot him , boss ? " shouted Sacha , the big Russian bartender at Pick 's place . Except for Yvonne , the girlfriend he had inherited from Rick , Sacha did n't much like the French . In truth , Sacha did n't much like anybody , and the feeling was mutual . " Not yet , " said Rick . " Maybe later . Maybe never . It all depends . " " Awww , " said Sacha , disappointed . Renault let out a long breath . Time to exhibit some of that famous French savoir faire . " A beautiful car is like a beautiful woman , do n't you think , Ricky ? " he said . " The lines , the curves , the hidden power under the hood . " Renault admired American cars , which was a good thing , since the European automakers had long since switched to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " He gave a little shake of his head in regret . " Speaking of which , " said Rick , " we 're going to need a few of those ourselves . Think you can help out ? " " I believe I still carry some authority in these parts , " said Renault , reaching into the breast pocket of his uniform . Long ago he had learned that one should never travel without a valid ticket to safety secreted somewhere upon one 's person . " Here they are : two exit visas . " " Make it three . " " Three ? " " One for me , one for you , and one for Sam . " " I see , " said Renault . He counted them out as if they were legal tender , except more valuable . " All they require is an authorized signature , which fortunately -- for the time being , at least -- is mine . " He scratched his name with a flourish , three times . From his pocket Rick produced a flask of bourbon , took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little Frenchman savored the liquor appreciatively . Rick did n't offer one to Sam . He knew better . Sam did n't drink with the customers , and Sam did n't drink with Rick . Sam did n't even drink with himself very often . " Let 's hope your John Hancock 's good until tomorrow morning , " said Rick . Inside the Buick it was warm and dry . Renault could feel the night 's chill starting to disperse . He had never liked Morocco all that much anyway . He would n't be sorry to leave it . " Things are becoming clearer to me now . You and Laszlo knew the end of the script before either of you said a line back there . " He wished he had something to smoke . " When did you hatch this plan ? " " When you had Laszlo in the holding pen , of course . " Rick lit another cigarette and offered the captain one as well . " After you 'd arrested him for being at the Underground meeting . I told you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . " " And you promised that you 'd entrap him for me by handing over the letters of transit , " interrupted Renault . " The setup was perfect for you , " Rick continued . " When you saw Laszlo and Ilsa walk into my cafe , you must have thought you were in seventh heaven , because they were in the one place in the world where you had the power of life and death over them . I gave you the chance to nab Laszlo and make yourself a hero with Strasser , and you fell for it like a ton of bricks . " " I did indeed , " admitted Renault . " There 's one thing I do n't understand , though . Why did you give the letters of transit to Laszlo and his wife ? Why did you change your mind about helping him escape Casablanca for Lisbon and America ? You , who always prided yourself on sticking your neck out for no man . Surely there must have been more in it for you than the relatively trifling sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , at nothing . " You might say I liked the potential payday . Or you might say I was tired of looking for the waters in Casablanca and coming up with nothing but sand . " He took a deep drag on his Chesterfield and exhaled . " Or you just might say that destiny finally caught up with me . " Her letter was in his breast pocket . Sam had given it to him in the cafe , before he had left for the airport and his fatal encounter with Major Strasser . It had been hidden in Sam 's piano , the same place Rick himself had hidden the stolen letters of transit that enabled Laszlo and Ilsa to get away . My dearest Richard , If you are reading this letter , it means that I have escaped with Victor . I thought that after Paris I should never have to part from you this way again . Yet here we are , having to say good-bye twice , once with our lips and once more with our hearts . You must believe me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead . We said no questions , and I never questioned the fact that I was free to love you . Some women search all their lives for a man to love . I have found two . As I write these words , I do n't know what will happen tonight at the airport . Like the last time we parted , I can not be sure that we shall meet again . But unlike the last time , I can hope . In Lisbon , we shall stay at the Hotel Aviz . After that , only God knows . Please come if you can . If not for my sake , then for Victor 's . We both need you . Ilsa -- The big car sailed through the damp night like an ocean liner on a calm sea , picking up speed despite the poor roadway . Sam piloted the vehicle expertly , the way he played the piano . He sensed rather than saw the turnoffs , reading them the way a blind man read Braille . They were well away from the city now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Rick . He was tired of talking , and before they lost the signal he wanted to hear some music . Maybe something from Benny Goodman and his band . He was also wondering whether the news of Major Strasser 's death had been broadcast yet . " Sure , boss , " said Sacha . He shot out one oversize hand and began worrying the radio dial until he managed to find a station . " Blah blah blah is all that 's on . " " Then turn the blah blah blah up so we can at least hear it , " Rick ordered . After all his time in Casablanca and in Paris , his French was still only passable , and sometimes he had trouble understanding on the telephone or over the radio . If anything important was going on , Louis would tell him soon enough . Or Sam , who learned languages the way he learned the piano , by ear . Renault was about to say something when something caught his attention . " Quiet ! " he shouted in a tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , and an excited voice suddenly filled the car . Even Rick knew what the announcer was saying . He just did n't want to believe it . In far-off Hawaii , the Japanese had just bombed Pearl Harbor . " Boss , we got trouble , " Sam said from the front seat . " I know that , " snapped Rick , trying to listen to the radio . He caught Sam 's gaze in the rearview mirror . " I mean we got company , " Sam explained calmly , slamming the car into high gear . Rick twisted in his seat . A pair of yellow headlamps was gaining on them . The silence was broken by the unmistakable sound of automatic weapons . A bullet pinged off the trunk of the Buick . " Gim me a clip , Sacha , " Rick said . " Right here , boss , " said the Russian , happy at last . Rick slammed it into his Colt .45 . He had always wanted to see if a phaeton with a 141-horsepower engine could outrun a Mercedes-Benz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
