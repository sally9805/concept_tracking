The Finnish-born metalsmith 's complex , compounded , curved works have a visual massiveness that belies their modest scale and light weight-they are composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shell structure , his " pushing the envelope " in this traditional technique , has opened up form and scale possibilities in metal . It is also a perfect tool to express his vision , which is informed by the organic , natural world . Seppa spent 27 years in St. Louis , Missouri , as founder and head ofthe metalsmithing department at Washington University School of Fine Arts ( now School of Art ) , retiring as professor emeritus of art in 1992 . A retrospective of his work was held this past spring in the Artisan Gallery at Laumeier Sculpture Park in St. Louis ( March iz-June 7 ) , and the importance of his work in the community could readily be seen in the makeup of the show . All but 15 of the 53 pieces were from local private and institutional collections . And these are the tip of the iceberg . In the public domain alone , other important works can be visited at St. Louis churches and synagogues . However local the provenance , the exhibition was inclusive in its examples of Seppa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for St. Michael and St. George Episcopal Church , to a beautiful , rather anthropomorphic tea set , jewelry and the purely decorative sculptural objects for which Seppa is internationally known . His materials are silver and gold-both metals often used in a single work-brass , precious and semiprecious stones , and even plastic . The white crosses that are elements of the church furnishings and the knobs on the tea service resemble ivory , but are actually Teflon . A brass sculpture Seppa made in 1976 refers to the Finnish national epic poem , The Kalevala , whose denouement concerns the felling of a giant oak . From a peaked hut shape with an excerpt from the poem inscribed on the surface , an encircled arm moves aggressively forward to end in a curved plow or hatchet form . Although coffee-table in scale , this form has the presence of a much larger work . Other sculptures are more jewel-like . Top Branch of Kalevala 's Big Oak , 1982 , is a silver rod that ends in a cluster of amethysts knotted together with silver tendrils . The fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closes in a thin loop to hold a delicate , honeycombed , podlike spike of gold . This piece illustrates one of Seppa 's technical **29;1090;TOOLONG tessellation . The honeycomb is made up of many tiny flat squares of gold soldered together , each with crimped corners and a circle cut from the center . Seppi is known in the metalsmithing community not only as an impeccable craftsman and a stringent teacher insisting on the disciplines of the craft , but also as an innovator , experimenting with ways to open up traditional methods to more expressive ends . In his writings and in his teaching , not only at Washington University but at workshops and seminars throughout the country , Seppa developed a vocabulary of basic methods-reticulation , rollprinting and shell structure ( anticlastic and synclastic sinking ) - to free the medium from the limitations of pure function . He discusses the range of his techniques in Form Emphasis for Metatsmiths ( Kent State University Press , 1978 ) , which went into its fifth printing in 1998. * " I am a missionary to American craftsmen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he now lives , to St. Louis to attend the 1999 conference ofthe Society of North American Goldsmiths ( SNAG ) , of which he is a founding member . " To make it possible to recognize other ways of working with silver , I had to develop a nomenclature for process . " He asserts in his book that " hindrance to freedom of artistic expression in metal lay in the product-oriented vocabulary . I felt that a more scientific nomenclature was needed to free artists from thinking of their works solely in terms of its end product . Coupled with this idea was an increased consciousness of form and a searching examination of both old and new techniques . " Seppa introduced one such technique , reticulation , to this country . When I asked John Baltrushunas , a former student and colleague of Seppa 's at Washington University , what hist eacher 's legacy would be , he replied , " Heikki brought European skills to this country . Also , the European idea that skill comes before freedom . He took those skills and developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He recognized that society did n't need silver tea sets and coffee services , that palace art ' was virtually dead . " Seppa was born in Finland in 1927 and studied at the Goldsmith School and the Central School of Industrial Arts , both in Helsinki . " It was a journeyman education-craft methods , not aesthetics , " he said , " a great technical background . We were expected to go into industry . " And from the age of iS he did , working in the Finnish silver industry for several years before moving to Copenhagen , Denmark , where he received professional trainingatthe renowned GeorgJensen workshops , and where he met and married his wife , Ulla . In 1951 the couple emigrated from Finland to British Columbia , Canada , where they remained for nine years . Arriving in the United States in 1960 , Seppa spent a year studying at Cranbrook Academy of Art and then taught for four years at the Art Center School in Louisville , Kentucky , before settling in St. Louis in 1965 . Recognized in his native land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1992 , Seppa has also been honored in this country with an artist 's grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1975 , election to the American Craft Council College of Fellows in 1987 and an Excellence in Art award from the Arts and Education Council of St. Louis in 1996 . Seppa 's wife died in 1993 , and although he has conducted workshops he concedes he has done little of his own work since then . But that may be changing . He is planning to marry Laurie Lyall , a fellow metalsmith , and they are currently building a house on spectacular Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound . Plans for the modern dwelling include a wraparound porch to take advantage of the views . Appropriately , it will be clad in steel . Heikki Seppa has demonstrated , it seems , that F. Scott Fitzgerald notwithstanding , there can be not only second , but third and even fourth acts in American lives .
