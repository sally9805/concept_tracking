Shortly after the Boeing 737 took off from the Xiamen airport bound for Guangzhou last week , a passenger clutching flowers proceeded to the cockpit . Perhaps assuming that the man wanted to offer the flowers to the crew as a Moon Festival token , two security guards allowed him through . Once inside , the passenger reportedly opened his jacket to reveal 15 lbs . of explosives strapped to his chest and ordered all crew members , except for the pilot , out of the cockpit . He then demanded that the plane fly to Taiwan . <P> Instead , the pilot continued on to Guangzhou and circled above the city 's Baiyun airport for 40 minutes . After the hijacker realized that he had been tricked , he either set off the bombs or scuffled with the pilot , causing the plane to lose control . Careening down the runway , the jet sideswiped an empty Boeing 707 parked nearby and slammed on top of a Boeing 757 filled with passengers en route to Shanghai . <P> Engulfed by a ball of flames , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported air disaster . Among the dead was the hijacker , later identified by provincial party officials as Jiang Xiaofeng , a 27-year-old " active criminal . "
