A Nordic country cashes in on its isolated gene pool <p> ICELAND IS FAMOUS for its volcanic deserts , smoking hot springs , glaciers , and ancient sagas  --  but not for its high-tech research . Yet on February 2 , 1998 , the Swiss drug manufacturer Roche Holding of Basel announced it would pay $200 million over the next five years for research by an obscure firm in Reykjavik called deCode Genetics , which at the time had no products , no clients , and less than a year 's operating experience . <p> What does Roche hope to get from deCode ? The answer can be found in the faces of Iceland 's mostly blond , blue-eyed , extremely homogeneous population . Roche wants Iceland 's genes . In the isolated , sparsely settled country , biomedical researchers have found a rich , pure genetic lode , relatively untainted by outside influence for hundreds of years . DeCode is offering itself as the genes ' broker and interpreter . <p> This partnership is just one of many attempts to profit from a revolution in human genome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past five years with go-go biotech entrepreneurs and pharmaceutical giants . They all dream the same dream : They realize that it may soon become possible to understand the genetic processes that cause disease and , as the genes yield up their secrets , to find ways of isolating and treating them . As Roche spokesman Roland Haefeli explains , this company thinks deCode 's research will help it " make drugs . " <p> As they pursue their research , companies want to patent the key gene sequences to protect their investments . Some critics charge that the patenting of genes amounts to robbing the public commons and is an immoral attempt to turn life into property . But deCode seems to have inoculated itself from charges of exploitation . Roche 's $200 million investment is a huge boost to Iceland 's economy and , the country hopes , just the beginning . How can anyone get angry about deCode 's patenting of Iceland 's genetic history when the whole country appears to have bought into it ? <p> THE 270,000 PEOPLE who live in Iceland many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended from a small number of original settlers , mostly Norsemen who came to the island around the 9th century . Since then , most Icelanders have been intermarrying and choosing their spouses from the same small group of Nordic families . <p> In the early 1400s , the Black Death swept through the island , killing two of every three inhabitants . Later , smallpox struck . And in the late 1700s , the volcano Hekla , east of Reykjavik , erupted and spewed ash over gardens and pastures . A severe famine followed . These catastrophes , combined with the isolation of the place , created population " bottlenecks " that constricted an already narrow gene pool . <p> This same harsh environment , however , also made Icelanders an ideal subject for genetic studies . As deCode 's president and CEO , Kari Stefansson , says , " We are , in a sense , mining the consequences of natural disasters . " The homogeneity of the population will help researchers identify the genes associated with a particular disease more quickly , since a limited genetic sample reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in any U.S. city , are difficult to study because they have so many genetic variations that it 's difficult to discern which contribute to disease . <p> Stefansson , 48 , a neurogeneticist and an Icelander himself , formed the idea for deCode while teaching at Harvard Medical School . His plan brought the company $12 million from American and European venture capitalists . He then recruited managers among Icelanders , many of whom had been trained at U.S. universities , and opened the lab in early 1997 , announcing some ambitious goals : DeCode planned to explore 25 to 35 common diseases . <p> The company began by identifying the genetic sequence responsible for a syndrome known as essential tremor ( shaky limbs ) . DeCode later studied multiple sclerosis , and laid plans to cover familiar illnesses such as alcoholism , inflammatory bowel disease , colon cancer , diabetes , heart disease , and schizophrenia . <p> Patients with these illnesses interact with deCode through a network of collaborating physicians . Based in offices around the island , the doctors gather blood samples and provide the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for testing , the doctors remove the patients ' names , replacing them with encrypted IDs . After receiving the samples , deCode processes the DNA in its laboratories , obtaining genotypes ( genetic profiles ) for each individual . <p> These are then matched with medical records , linking genotype to phenotype data  --  physical details , including a person 's disease status , age , and weight . DeCode fits each genotype into a jigsaw puzzle of family inheritance patterns that can be verified , if necessary , by referring to Iceland 's genealogical records dating back 1,000 years ( and now almost entirely computerized ) . Such a massive cross-referencing should give deCode an unprecedented ability to isolate genes . <p> The company is also building its own internal database on a large number of Icelanders . DeCode hopes to sell access to this database , called the Genotypes , Genealogy , Phenotypes , and Resources ( GGPR ) collection , to drug companies such as Roche . The data , deCode claims , will be used only " to identify families in which specific diseases occur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rapidly identify the genetic basis of the disease . " <p> Any commercial drug or gene-based diagnostic test developed from the research , Stefansson says , will be provided free of charge to all Icelanders during the lifetime of the patent ( between 17 and 20 years ) . These gestures acknowledge what Stefansson refers to as the company 's " core asset . " He notes : " Our relationship with the population is the most important thing we have . " <p> The country 's politicians and medical leaders have given deCode their approval . So has the Health Ministry 's Medical Ethics Committee . Iceland 's prime minister , David Oddsson , considers the project " extremely important , " saying it will help his nation " secure foreign investment . " <p> Stefansson also has taken steps to allay concerns about invasion of privacy . He promises patients who consent to this research that their identities will not be transmitted to the company at all . While deCode retains a master index that links names and encrypted IDs , Stefansson says it is " kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need two keys to get into it . We have one of them , and the Icelandic Data Protection Committee has the other . " DeCode could never get access to the names without an official watching over its shoulder . <p> This pledge , and Icelanders ' traditional trust in their leaders , seems to have banished skepticism . It 's hard to imagine any U.S. agency being entrusted to keep so much volatile information in one database  --  medical records , genetic test results , and family histories going back a millennium . But in Iceland , that is exactly what deCode is doing . <p> WHILE GENE COLLECTION is moving along at a rapid pace in Europe and the United States , some attempts to collect genes from less developed countries have backfired . Genetic researchers , sponsored initially by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy , have been building up vast archives of human genes for basic research on diseases . Their attempts to conduct a survey of global human diversity came to a standstill , however , when they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens objected when Western companies made efforts to collect genes using local physicians as research partners , accusing the firms of " biopiracy "  --  quietly exporting valuable genetic data and not sharing the wealth with the local population . In 1997 , reacting to fears that China 's genetic heritage might be ripped off , the government drafted new regulations limiting the export of biological materials . <p> But interest from private industry has only accelerated ( see chart , page 52 ) . For example , in 1993 scientists with Sequana Therapeutics descended upon the tiny Atlantic island of Tristan da Cunha , where the 300 or so residents have an abnormally high rate of asthma . Since then , Sequana ( now Axys Pharmaceuticals ) has filed patents for what it believes are isolated asthma genes . While Axys could reap millions for a drug that cures asthma , the people of Tristan da Cunha wo n't have access to it unless they pay for it . <p> DeCode 's project in Iceland is fueling a broader concept than just identifying disease genes . " Pharmacogenomics " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by many of the largest drug companies , it envisions using genetic testing to screen out the most suitable patients for clinical drug trials . Researchers would select the candidates whose genetic profiles showed that they belonged to a group of individuals most likely to benefit from the drug being tested . If the experimental medicine proved successful , the company would then sell it to patients in the general population with the same genetic characteristics as those in the drug trial . It sounds good : Pills and people could be matched efficiently , reducing bad side effects . <p> Roche , one of the worlds top manufacturers of medical diagnostics , and other pharmaceutical companies have another reason for being interested in matching patients to drugs : It might save a lot of money in clinical trials . If it were possible to screen out the nonresponders in advance , patient enrollment in a typical drug trial might shrink significantly . Since companies pay out of past profits for such trials , this savings would be worth billions of dollars a year . <p> At least one biotech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rockville , Maryland  --  has said that he does n't think it is wise to use genetic screens in order to slot patients into different types of drug therapy , worrying that patients might be screened improperly , and thus be given the wrong , possibly dangerous , drugs . <p> Another , perhaps bigger , obstacle for this new industry is how patients will react to the idea of genetic testing . If drugs are developed , say , to screen people thought to be at risk for early heart disease , these still-healthy people will have to be genotyped . People will , essentially , need to have bar codes . But they may not want to submit to the testing . They may prefer not to know  --  or have others know  --  exactly what risk categories they fit into . Many fear that a centralization of such knowledge could lead to genetic discrimination . If it fell into the hands of personnel offices and insurance companies , for example , they might try to use it to screen out high-risk applicants . <p> At the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genotyping patients and tailoring drugs are still only theoretical . But with so much pharmaceutical company money pouring into the hands of researchers , the science wo n't just be abandoned . Whole-population genetic screening , and the testing of drugs matched to " appropriate " patients , is the brave new frontier in genetic medicine , and it seems likely to get started soon in Iceland , where the population 's faith in its leaders  --  and deCode  --  will ultimately be put to the test . . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Tissue samples for the Human Genome Project in a storage refrigerator at Washington University in St. Louis <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ICELAND 'S BLOND <p> A researcher collects DNA from a laboratory freezer ( above ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kari Stefansson ( right ) , the founder of deCode , is blond , ambitious , and Nordic .
