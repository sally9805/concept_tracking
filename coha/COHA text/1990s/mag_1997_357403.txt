The tale came to a close in one of those rituals of shared planetary theater : a joining of tragedy and gossip in universal soap opera . But whatever emotional residue lingered as the world dried its eyes , two slightly hard-edged questions presented themselves in another part of the brain . The questions were not necessarily unkind . They were churned up by the undercurrent of sadness and disgust and fatalism that ran through one 's thoughts on hearing the news from Paris that night , and in the days that followed . <P> The first question was this : Why on earth would anyone want to be famous , especially now ? ( What a nightmare ! What a disaster ! ) <P> And the second question ( the obverse of the first ) : Why do masses of men and women feel such intense emotion about the life and death of people who are strangers to them  --  strangers , that is , except to the extent that masses of people have been deceived by the tabloids into an illusion of intimacy with the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grief an illusion as well ? Or how exactly do we assess the emotional truth of these outpourings ? A moment of poignant communion in the Family of Man ? A cheap exploitation of sympathies one centimeter deep ? Or is there a third possibility ? Something to do with mortals and gods and goddesses ? <P> To be famous is among the basic human ambitions , of course , an all but universal fantasy . Who  --  except for nuns and monks , say , who are content with God 's radiant attention  --  sets out in life to remain obscure ? Fame is fun  --  and vindication . One need never be lonely , anywhere , ever . Fame has style , glamour , money , attention ; ignites the sudden light of recognition in strangers ' eyes , commands the comic deference of headwaiters as they sweep you past the serfs and hoi polloi to the best table . <P> Some who have come to be famous see in retrospect that the daydream may have been touchingly adolescent , self-inflating in the style of Mr. Toad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more retrograde : neurotic , infantile , a sort of baby 's unappeasable love craving , a raw , screaming hunger . <P> In any case , one should beware of answered prayers . Those with hard experience at being famous know that while celebrity can occasionally be delightful , it may become a burden , an arduous and menacing bore . Just how menacing it can be we saw in the middle of that recent night in Paris . <P> It was always a primitive terror to be cast out of the tribe and made to wander as a stranger . Today a famous person  --  Arnold Schwarzenegger , say , or Sylvester Stallone , those universal action figures whose films require the fewest subtitles and therefore address masses most eloquently in remote cultures  --  might go anywhere on earth and never be a stranger . Is that desirable ? Or a horror ? Such planetary recognition may be as dangerous , in a different way , as being an unknown alien once was .               @ @ @ @ @ @
