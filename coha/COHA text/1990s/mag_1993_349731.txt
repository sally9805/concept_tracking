TITLE : ANNIE WARBUCKS <P> AUTHORS : MUSIC BY CHARLES STROUSE ; LYRICS BY MARTIN CHARNIN ; BOOK BY THOMAS MEEHAN <P> WHERE : OFF-BROADWAY <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : Same orphaned kid , same doggy pet tricks , same bald tycoon , but definitely not the same joy . <P> The 1977 moppet-meets-millionaire musical Annie reaped $380 million at the box office and , with stock and amateur productions , turned into an annuity for its creators  --  which is a good thing , because none of them have had much but flops onstage ever since . Not surprisingly , they decided to try to make lightning strike twice . Alas , the sequel that opened off-Broadway last week provides at best a mild spark . It is pleasant , tuneful , funny and fit for whole families . It just does n't make spectators tingle . <P> The show begins right where the last one left off , with the plucky orphan gamboling around a Christmas tree with her adoptive plutocrat . In steams a social-welfare commissioner with a bad attitude , played by Alene Robertson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coarsest . The adoption is invalid , she tells Daddy Warbucks , because he does n't have a wife . The rest of the show is devoted to marrying him off and extracting him from the tentacles of the adhesive and ambitious commissioner . Along the way father faces financial ruin , daughter runs away and turns hobo , a potential wife plots to murder both , and Franklin D. Roosevelt gets , as he drolly hums it , " all dolled up " for a soigne soiree on the Staten Island ferry . <P> Several things are wrong with this amiably unpretentious fable . First , after repeatedly failing to reach Broadway , the creators have opted for a postage- stamp stage in lower Manhattan . The sets are mostly paintings on roller- drops , slowly uncoiling to the floor ( " It looks like we 're in the 19th century , " admits one of the team privately ) , and choreographer Peter Gennaro has no room to move . The use of Theoni Aldredge 's Broadway-budget costumes just makes the surrounding skimpiness look worse . <P> Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revamped in incident but not much in basic devices since its disastrous 1990 Washington tryout . While the first act twists and surprises , the bland second act feels eternal . <P> Most ruinous , title actress Kathryn Zaremba , a nine-year-old from Broken Arrow , Oklahoma , is loud and clear but never vulnerable or soft  --  she 's like Ethel Merman at her brassiest , without the compensating musicality , rather than a cuddlesome child . By the end there 's hardly a wet eye in the house .
