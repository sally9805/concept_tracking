In the early season , when streams are not yet swollen by spring showers , trout are attracted to ultralight spoons and spinners . By using such light metal lures , your catch counts are sure to increase . This is a story about slipping from the main stream to catch trout in low , cold , quietly moving currents before spring torrents arrive . The angling method described here will take you to splits off the big rivers , to small tributaries , and then back to the main-stem rivers later in the year when water levels are stable or when the same rivers run low in autumn . During these different seasonal periods the same technique works ; you need only target the right water . I call it metaling with trout . The method centers on ultralight metal lures , which are often shelved and forgotten by anglers intent on battling deep flows with bottom-bouncing techniques or replaced by the fly-fishing tactics of deep nymphing and quiet water midging . Metal lures are used on both fly and spinning rods and may be the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force you to learn about seasonal river changes as you seek the proper places to fish the little attractors . The lures encompass both spoon and spinner configurations , and many are as light as 24 grains ( 0.05 ounce ) ; some are less than 16 grains . You can not throw these featherweight rigs with a spinning rod unless you crimp split shot 14 inches ahead of them ( which only works sometimes ) . But there are other blades  --  1/12 or one-sixth ounce in weight  --  ideally suited to the spinfisherman using some of the new microlight tackle . Ultralight metal lures are right up there in effectiveness with natural bait , and they are even more deadly when coupled with it . Especially in early spring , tipping the hook of an ultralight lure with a bit of red or garden worm will heighten your chances of taking trout . However , you wo n't need the natural bait later in the spring , summer or fall . OUT OF THE MAIN STREAM Obviously , tiny metal lures are not intended to reach bottom in swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained by popular weighted spinners like the Mepps , CP Swing , Rooster Tail and Panther Martin . So , you 're probably wondering , where do you use these ultralight wonders ? The answer , again , is out of the main stream , and this corresponds to the basic needs of river trout . The fish require protection from strong current and their enemies . They also need their food delivered closely by the current flow . ( See stream illustrations for specific trout holding areas . ) ( Illustrations omitted ) In warmer weather , ultralights are good in all types of holding water except glassy flats and delicate spring creeks . Flogging the water with metal lures will put trout down in these stream environments . Instead , work riffles , pocket water that 's not too deep and also current deflectors such as rocks , boulders and logs . SPOONS AND SPINNERS Light spoons and spinner blades have widely varying actions that are suitable for a range of stream conditions . The spinners I use are all built around the classic swivel and split ring configuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wider Colorado blades are all good choices . I prefer sizes No. 0 through No. 2 or No. 3 . A spinner is best used in slower currents . It cuts a tighter path of travel , spinning on its axis , humming along busily and looking to trout like very easy pickings . Spoon shapes are more varied . They can be basic teaspoon shape , bent in the middle , head or tail , or in an S-shape . Spoons are generally retrieved faster than spinners , and they work better in swift water . In these conditions , spoons begin to dart or turn over , though some designs spin , break cadence , dart , then turn again excitedly . At slower speeds , spoons wobble and weave lazily from side to side . You can assemble your own ultralight spinners from components available through mail-order firms , but spoons are best purchased commercially . I have several favorite designs . Right at the top is the Shad King or Russian Spinner . This little lure , actually a spoon , has its tail bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vibrating action and at very fast speeds will spin . There are two tiny flicker blades hung on its single hook , which if too flashy , can be cut off . I find that No. 1 , No. 2 and No. 3 are perfect for a light fly rod , while No. 3 1/2 is probably best on an ultralight spin outfit with split shot . Other good ultralights include the Flicker spinner with flicker blades on the hook , and the straight old Colorado spinner . These selections are all available from Hildebrandt , which also makes the Little Shaver spoon , another fine choice . The 1/12-ounce Phoebe spoon from Acme has a unique arched bend that produces very strong vibrations ; you can feel it right down in your rod grip . The spoon must telegraph those vibrations a long distance underwater because it catches fish like crazy . The model 5321 Canadian Wonder spoon from the Les Davis division of Luhr-Jensen is another winner in No. 0 . Its front end is bent slightly down and its back is convex , ending in a dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific action . I 've even cut ultralight trolling flutter spoons down to size for small stream trout . Try the Luhr-Jensen Alpena Diamond flutter spoon , No. 31 , but replace the too-large hook . Use this spoon with a split shot ahead on a spinning rod . It handles a pretty broad range of water currents . Not to be overlooked are the very productive Skeeter size Dardevles designed for fly-rod use . For slightly deeper , faster water the Mepps Syclops No. 00 , and the company 's new mini Timber Doodle are excellent spoons , but we 're getting into " heavier " stuff here , as the lures weigh one-sixth ounce and one-eighth ounce , respectively . Gold , silver , nickel , copper and brass are tackle box standards . I often add a touch of fluorescent red at the front end of spoons or spinner blades . A stripe of bright blue , or periwinkle-purple , painted with nail polish , is sometimes an aid . PRESENTATION COUNTS Light metal lures can be presented upstream , cross-stream or downstream , but it 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fishing . Once I brought a friend who was skilled in bass fishing to a favorite mini stream . After drying the tears of laughter over the light tackle I 'd stuffed in his nearly baseball-glove-size fist , he got serious . In bright sunlight we stalked a fairly long , clear amber pool that began at the base of a little falls . I explained where I thought trout might be holding along the pool 's length , and he slammed the spoon right on the head of where the nearest fish should have been . The trout was there , and we could see it streaking upstream , spooking others as it went . " Well , there they were , " I said . The trick would have been to cast beyond the likely holding place  --  as in tossing a crankbait near a stump to tempt a largemouth bass . You sometimes can hit trout on the head with a dry fly , but never with metal , unless the water is a bit frothy . This is especially true if you 're casting downstream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trout . Steer it gently with sideways rod movements so that the lure eventually approaches naturally from slightly ahead and to one side of the fish . Do n't bring it up to the poor fish 's tail end or get it crabbing sideways into a trout 's flanks , unless you enjoy watching the fish squirt away in terror . Casting upstream , bringing an ultralight spoon or spinner down-current , requires knowing exactly how fast you must retrieve a particular lure to bring out its best action . Test the lure in similar current before presenting it to a fish . Trimmed with a bit of worm in he early spring , however , an ultralight becomes more of a flashy attractor and its normal action is not so important . You 'll mainly be drifting the combo offering into feeding lanes . Cross-stream and downstream presentations are much like showing a streamer or wet fly to a salmon . In these circumstances , allow the metal-plus-worm offering to tumble along until you apply resistance by raising your rod slightly , stripping or cranking a few turns before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering down an entire run along a bank , through a deep holding channel in a riffle or along a seam where fast and slow currents meet . In many ways , fishing the little metal lures parallels various flyfishing tactics . Using the very lightest of ultralight metal lures has an added bonus for beginner flyfishermen  --  with a five to seven-foot leader and floating fly line , it 's a good way to build flycasting confidence . Take my friend Jill Kinney . A competent angler with spinning tackle , she was convinced it would take her too long to learn flycasting . I suggested she try a No. 1 Colorado spinner on a nine-foot fly rod . With the long rod , Kinney found it nearly effortless to flick the ultralight into pockets and pools she 'd normally fish with heavier weighted spinners . At first she was overly aware of the movements of snaking out the lure on the fly line , but then fishing concentration took over . Several rainbows later , she was n't thinking about the tackle much at all . Not that Kinney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did  --  come later . But actually catching fish on fly tackle and learning to control line had given her the confidence to go on . Brookies , cutthroats , browns and rainbows all fall for ultralight metal lures . Even species that are mainly insectivorous will smash metal lures instinctively , and it seems to take the fish longer to become conditioned to the offerings than to larger , heavier spoons and spinners . After you 've garnered some field experience with the little lures this spring , be on a favorite stream at pre-dawn some summer morning . Before the rest of the world comes alive , those flesh-eating buster-size browns you 've always suspected might live there are up in the shallows hunting little fish . They might be on the flats , in the riffles at mouths of coves in water so shallow that their tails and dorsals show . Approach with the cunning you 'd use stalking big game , for basically you are . Use all the skill you 've developed in the early season to set your tiny spoon or spinner trembling and darting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next sound you hear will be your own successful whoop : Gotcha ! RIFFLE WATER One of the best places in the early spring to work ultralight metal lures is in small freestone streams . Use the lures in all key trout holding places : in bouncy , shallow riffle water , specifically in the slicks and Vs made by depressions or other objects beneath the surface in the riffles ; ahead of and behind rocks and gravel bars both in and out of riffle areas . Fish the area where the riffled water begins to flatten . Although it might not appear that trout would hold in such shallow water , the fish are often there . From the late spring into the summer , an excellent spot for the ultralights is the bouncy deeper riffle water where trout are not rising but where you 're likely to attract fish with a bushy dry fly . At other times the metal lures should be fished more like a dead drifted wet fly or like an active streamer . SIDE SPLITS Side splits or sloughs just off the main river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Do n't head for the quiet backwaters where trout are often daintily sipping midges or blue-winged olives and might be put off by the flash of metal . Instead , target the mouths of the sloughs , especially the point of bank where the water enters . Also target the first gentle water after a midriver bar , island or boulder that causes a split to branch off the main flow . POCKET WATER In small brooks , pools are usually shallow enough for the ultralights , and sometimes there are miniature pocket-water sections that can be worked with metal lures . Fish the slightly wrinkled water or slicks protected by rocks from the main flow in these faster pocket sectors of a brook . Pocket water in larger rivers is usually too much for the unweighted ultralights in the early season , but it wo n't be later in the year . The kind of water where you 'd drop a big weighted nymph in spring can be fantastic a little later in the year for the unweighted blades . STREAM BENDS Small stream bends are good prospecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop , larger river bends may have slowed enough to try light metal lures . However , I avoid the spot where the full force of the current hits the bank on the outside of the bend . Instead , explore the spot just opposite that collision point , the seam of water where fast and slow currents meet . This holding place will extend out , closer to the collision point , later in the season . Eddies or back currents ahead of the collision point are good earlier in the year but often become stagnant later on . DEEP BANKS Ultralight metal will usually work later in the year along the deeper bank of a small stream . Bank areas are often hiding places for surprisingly large trout , especially if there is cover growth  --  willows and alders  --  or if the vegetation is well undercut . Overhanging branches can make casting tough , but the rewards make occasional snags worthwhile . FISHING YEARBOOK ' ' 93 It used to be that April marked the official beginning of the fishing season .

JERRY GIBBS ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME In nearly every popular sport , there is a means of recognizing a lifetime achievement for dedication and excellence in the given arena  --  election to the sport 's hall of fame . Outdoor Life Fishing Editor Jerry Gibbs was recently bestowed with that prestigious honor , with his induction as a " Legendary Angler " into the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward , Wisconsin . Fishing Editor since 1973 , Gibbs succeeded the late Joe Brooks at Out-door Life  --  no small challenge , as Brooks was one of the most revered and respected fishing writers ever to wield rod and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the man for the job . In his 20-year tenure with Outdoor Life , he has written hundreds of articles that have guided generations of fishermen to better ways of wetting a line . His assignments have taken him from his Vermont home to New England beaver ponds , to raging Western rivers , to South American lakes , to Russia 's wild salmon streams  --  literally around the world . Always conscious of issues beyond tackle and techniques , many of Gibbs ' articles have focused on conservation and protection of our fishing heritage . For example , his work to expose the faulty science that warned Americans against consuming Great Lakes fish earned him special recognition and helped save from possible ruin the charter boat industry on the Great Lakes . In addition to his work for Outdoor Life , Gibbs has authored or coauthored six books , including one that he researched by spending hundreds of hours underwater in scuba gear observing bass behavior . His writings have been used by Encyclopedia Brittanica , the Sport Fishing Institute and National Fisheries Institute .
