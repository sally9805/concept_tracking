In the beginning you and your honey were good together . Things can be gain Photograph // I NEVER EXPECTED TO STAY MARRIED . To get married-wear the dress , say " I do " - yes . But the " till death do us part " portion did n't seem remotely feasible , given my history . I come from women who put men out : out of the house , out of their lives , out of their minds . They do n't cry on Oprah . They do n't fistfight for Jerry . They keep on stepping . My mother and father divorced . My aunt divorced a truly no-good man . Shortly after my grandmother hurled a skillet full of frying porgies toward her belligerent second husband , who had the audacity to raise his hand ( read : lose his mind ) to her in her kitchen while she was cooking , Nana showed him the door and called her lawyer . " Can do bad by my damnself , " she was heard to mutter as she wiped up the grease . Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my first marriage ended in divorce ? We all bring our histories into our marriages . And we tote our expectations as well . One does n't negate the other . With heavy baggage strapped to my back , I still wanted out of marriage what other women seek : blessed union , oneness , bliss , a merry-go-round of endless fun and passion . I just did n't know what it took to get these things . I wed a second time . Ellis is long and lean , smart and loving , and blessed with parents who have been married forever . We bonded over intense conversations , jokes , deep kisses , mutual excitement about what the future might bring , and our children . We made us some big plans . And despite my background , we 've had 14 good years . Therapy taught me that I deserve a steady man and a relationship filled with ardor . I 've had to learn on my own what Mama could n't tell me : Maintenance is the glue that bonds two partners forever . Where Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brass ring in our marriages : We Buppies and Generation-Xers believe that matrimony itself is that ring . But wedlock is made up of the tiny , incessantly ordinary bookkeeping moments of life , and if we are n't vigilant those moments can be all there is . It does n't matter if a couple has been together one year or 50 , no one is immune to the damage that can be done by not paying attention . If Ellis and I were a car , we 'd be a Rolls . And we 'd need a tune-up . The telltale signs that a marital overhaul is overdue : too many conversations that center on the business of marriagethe house , the bills , the obligations . There are too many movies we missed , too many parties we did n't go to , too many trips we meant to take . Meanwhile , I 'm beginning to yearn for one of those **38;1126;TOOLONG marathon talks that we used to have all the time . Can I get a witness ? When my homegirl was thinking about leaving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk . We do n't make love . We do n't do anything together . " I remember when they seemed inseparable . So , how does it happen ? How do you get from being two people who ca n't stand being apart to two people who ca n't think of anything to say to each other ? How do you go from craving a man 's body to thinking of sex as a chore ? Is there a point on the marital map that says : Danger zone , doldrums ahead ? If you know the sign , can you avoid that highway ? And if you take a wrong turn and wind up in that terrible land of the blahs , or an even worse place , how do you find your way back home ? Keeping Boredom at Bay " Marriage is like a garden , " says Rhonda Brinkley-Kennedy , Psy.D. , a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles . " You have to attend to it . It has to be weeded , watered , pruned ; otherwise the garden will become choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In every marriage there are highs and lows . You ca n't stay in the honeymoon stage all the time . Reality , challenges and traumas occur in life . But we definitely have to write in some excitement . We have to renourish and rediscover each other . " Boredom rolls in like the fog ; all of a sudden it 's there and you ca n't see your way clearly My nail technician , Melanie , told me that she and her husband , Richard , a barber , ran smack into the humdrums during the second year of their marriage . ( I 've changed identifying details of the couples to protect their privacy . ) The thirtysomething Los Angeles couple stopped going to clubs together and started hanging out separately with friends . They began falling asleep instead of making love . But Melanie , who can paint nails , soak feet and run her mouth all at the same time , spoke up and confronted the issue . " I told Richard that I was getting bored , " Melanie says . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many separate activities , it means that the marriage is n't stimulating , " says Gail Wyatt , Ph.D. , licensed clinical psychologist and author of Stolen Women ( John Wiley &; Sons , $14.95 ) , a book about Blackfemale sexuality . She credits Melanie for handling her dissatisfaction in a mature way . " She did n't blame Richard ; she simply let him know how she felt . " The couple came up with their own prescription for regaining zest . " We started dating again , " says Richard . " I try to take her out to plays , the marina , even just a movie . And we keep our spiritual life stable . Our love for Christ holds us together . " Other couples may discover that counseling can help them find their way back . " There are so many " toys " in the average American home that couples really do n't have to interact , " says Wyatt . " Creating and then re-creating a unit keeps people together . Marriages grow best when they are reborn . In therapy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they first were attracted to each other . " That can become more challenging over time . " We 've gone through periods where we felt as though we were just coexisting , " says Bill , 57 , of his 35-year partnership with his wife , Dale , 56 . After the children were born , our love had to be shared with them . Passion requires attention to each other . " " We tried to get it back , " adds Dale . " We took trips , just the two of us , to China , to Africa . But I missed the girls . " She paused for a moment , and I sensed that she was searching for just the right words . " It was n't just the kids ; life robbed us of passion . " The Cincinnati couple admit that their marriage hit its lowest point during a period in the eighties when Bill was experiencing intense pressure at work . ( Both husband and wife are lawyers . ) " He wanted to remain at his firm . I advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dale . Thankful they 've always been " good communicators , " she says , they talked their way back to each other . When Dale convinced Bill that her only desire was to remove him from a painful situation , he realized that his wife was on his side . The departure of their daughters has ushered in a new era for their marriage . " Since the girls have gone to school , our passion is back , " says Bill . " We have a double-date night with another couple . We might take long walks . The romantic feeling has returned . " But clinical psychologist Clive D. Kennedy , Ph.D . ( BrinkleyKennedy 's husband ) , cautions parents not to wait until the nest is empty to nurture their union . He says that a marriage is like a " living organism " and couples should view theirs almost as they would another child in need of daily attention . How Anger Erodes Intimacy Without intimacy-the feeling of being entwined because I 've seen your warts and you 've seen mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite the patience and care it took to knit . For some folks a protracted period of being out of sync can spiral into fighting . Randall , 47 , and Kay , 45 , who 've been married nearly 15 years , lead a high-powered , high-stress , high-maintenance life in New York City . Randall is the CONTINUED ON PAGE 155 executive producer of a theater company and Kay is a much-sought-after visual artist . Both their adult children from previous marriages and their extended families are loving but demanding of their attention . CONTINUED ON PAGE lso Their schedules keep them separated a lot . When times get tense they begin screaming at each other . " We fight by exploding , " Kay says . " We try to sit down and discuss things , but we end up yelling . We need to learn to argue constructively . " Wyatt says , " Yelling is a subtle way of being abusive . It 's not a good way to resolve anger ... too risky . " Kennedy agrees : " When one partner finds him- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can mean that the couple needs a time-out . " Randall declares that he 's the one who 's most likely to leave the room . But Kennedy adds that giving each other space is only the first step . " Husbands and wives need to listen in order to understand their spouse . To love is to listen . " That 's why whoever walks away should make sure to put the issue back on the table later . Some bitter arguments and soulsearching have made the couple more aware of the volatility in their marriage , and more determined to control it . Randall and Kay have found that tuning into each other is easier when they tune out the world for a period . They own a summer home in Sag Harbor , New York , and have a favorite inn in Italy . They retreat to either spot to replenish their spirits , relieve pressure and deepen communication . " Even when we were broke , we always had getaway weekends . We 'd drive to Atlantic City and rebond , " adds Kay . Couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they can air concerns before they escalate into crises , say the experts . Kay and Randall found that their weekly drive to the accountant is a perfect time for each to have a say . In the car , each has the other 's undivided attention . At their accountant 's office , they talk about the business aspect of their marriage so that it does n't dominate their time together at home . Every Wednesday they have a lunch date . Playtime is important , too , say the experts . It helps to feed a reservoir of goodwill . Golfing is their newest way to enjoy each other 's company . As they relax together more , they find themselves fighting less frequently . " But We 're Happy-Could It Happen to Us ? ' Seasoned couples face the challenge of keeping love alive . Newlyweds , on the other hand , are so enraptured with each other that they can easily overlook differences they bring to the relationship that have the potential to sour it . Lanie and Walter , both 27 , have been married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Monica , California , pair believe they have found the key to happiness in each other 's arms . He trains corporate workers to use computers . She 's an assistant producer on a film project . They met at a lecture on Malcolm X at UCLA . Lanie says their relationship has only gotten better since they married : " We can sit and talk and cuddle for hours . " Home ownership and parenthood are part of their fiveyear plan . Even lopsided job schedules ca n't dull their love , they say . Lanie works 12 to 15 hours a day to Walter 's eight-hour shift . But he 's not complaining about how little they see each other during the week , or his added responsibilities at home . " Because I 'm more established in my field , and she 's getting a foothold in hers , we decided she needs the most support , " Walter says . Their only issue , Lanie says-and she feels it 's a small one-is Walter 's relaxed approach to household chores . Both agree that Lanie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She grew up with a mother who was a drill sergeant when it came to cleaning , while Walter 's mother and father were more easygoing . " When it 's his turn to clean the bathroom , somehow it does n't get done as fast as I 'd like , " she says . " We 've had it out about that , and he 's working on it . " Lanie and Walter have n't seen the ugly side of love , but they still need to work on their partnership . Kennedy says , " I see a lot of assets in this marriage . But I think Lanie needs to own the emotionality that comes from her childhood and recognize the cleaning struggle as hers . She needs to take it out of the marriage struggle . Walter needs to empathize with her . They need to communicate about the cleaning issue in a more in-depth way . " In other words , they should agree on a new vision of home life that 's based on what works for them as a couple , not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be small . Yet hidden expectations that go unmet or assumptions that go unchallenged can pave the way for bitterness and resentment . How they tackle this will help lay the foundation for how they 'll communicate and problem-solve as a couple . Power Plays Unlike the newlyweds , Sheila and Roy are struggling to stay together . The couple hit a hard bump two years ago when Roy , acting on a hunch , walked into the Louisville nightclub that his wife , an architect , had recently designed and saw her kissing another man . But even before that kiss , their marriage was in trouble . Initially Roy was attracted to Sheila 's power in the world . " We were the only two Blacks working on a government construction site , " Roy , a manager of construction sites , recalls . " I noticed Sheila because she had the highest possible security clearance . I wanted to know who she was . " But it is the imbalance of power in this marriage that threatens it . " In 1993 Sheila left her job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had major financial problems . " Sheila does n't seem to support her husband 's contention that they were facing financial ruin . She hints that something else caused Roy 's anger . " He did n't believe I could start my own business . When I did , it gave me independence . " Roy seems to both admire and resent the fact that Sheila quit her job and became her own boss . He once referred derisively to his wife 's work as " drawing houses . " In one breath he called Sheila " a golden goose " and said , " She can make money from her skills . " But in the next he lamented the fact that she did n't have time for him . He admits that he no longer tries to please his wife . " I used to go out of my way to romance her , but after what happened I just felt like a fool . " Sheila downplays the incident at the club . " The man had feelings for me I did n't return . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man when her own husband is at home with their child is having a secret life . Her dissatisfaction with their married life is palpable . She says , " I ask myself , How can I be so up and he 's so down ? We 're in two different worlds . " Marriage , of course , is about being in the same world in a committed , loving way . The three therapists agree that Roy and Sheila need counseling . The couple had gone to a counselor previously , but Roy refused to return after the second session . " Roy sees Sheila as more powerful than he is , " says Wyatt . " He 's trying to regain power by making her feel guilty about being the more powerful partner . " Brinkley-Kennedy wonders if Roy and Sheila were ever friends . " Sheila is getting many of her needs met in the world , " she says . " I feel Roy experienced betrayal prior to what occurred in his marriage . This is a relationship without trust . They 're both hurting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't given up on healing , though . He says the couple 's faith in God and their devotion to their son will keep them working toward reconciliation : " We 're getting the plan together for our marriage . " Perhaps marital counseling through the couple 's church is an option he 'd consider . I can understand why my grandmother threw in the towel along with the frying pan . Marriage is difficult and rewards are n't promised . A little bit of marriage 's Black history : We left slavery in pairs . Even before Black matrimony was legal and binding , we took jumping over that broom seriously . Back then it was about could he clear a field , could she fry a hoecake . But expectations should rise like the dust our slave ancestors kicked up with their bare feet as they marched toward freedom . Black Americans have more at stake than any other group when it comes to getting our relationships right . The world holds us in such disdain it is essential that we love ourselves into a mighty healing . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need to date each other again . Together we decided to describe ten fantasy dates on little cards . The plan is to put them in a jar , pick one each week and do what the card says . I trust that we will write down whatever will give us space to hold hands , let our hearts touch once again , and rediscover who we used to be , who we still are . I 'm seeking occasions that provide us with the power of regeneration , that restore our hope and validate our choice of each other as life mates . We can all do bad , both by ourselves and with our partners . What I 'm longing for this Saturday night and all the ones that follow is a little grace , a chance to experience again and again how my man and I can be good together . Sidebar PASSION Sidebar Ronn Elmore , Psy.D. , author of How to Love a Black Man and How to Love a Black Woman ( both published by Warner Books ) , along with Clive D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave us these tips for chasing away boredom and bringing back bliss : Show up for your marriage . Do n't simply focus on career , parenting , household duties . Isolate the " us " and keep it sacred . Do n't keep score . Recognize the responsibility you both have to nurture your relationship . Many partners say they 'll do whatever it takes " as long as she ( he ) does such and such . " Can you imagine telling your child " I 'll feed you , as long as your dad does his part " ? Make each other laugh . Before you two became settled , you probably went out of your way to be witty , charming and spontaneous . Maintaining the fun must be a priority and often you have to work at it . Do n't wait to appreciate . Think of several small " gifts " you might provide your spouse-wash dishes unexpectedly , roll up a little " I love you " note in a pair of socks , bring a single rosebud for no special occasion . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Keep up appearances . Pay attention to your weight , general fitness , hair , skin and attire . It 's amazing how people 's looks tend to improve when they 're contemplating an affair or divorce . Why not make the same effort for your spouse ? Expect change-and embrace it . Many couples are surprised to find that once committed or married , they find their interests and needs change .
