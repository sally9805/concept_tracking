Never mind that Christmas is fast approaching . Many American companies have decided they can wait no longer to slash labor costs . In quick succession last week , three major U.S. firms announced layoffs . GM said it will significantly restructure its operations but wo n't disclose the actual number of job cuts until this week . Industry experts predict as many as 35,000 employees , or about 9% of GM 's work force , may be gone by 1993 . TRW , the defense and credit- reporting firm , plans to cut 10,000 jobs , or 14% of its payroll , during the next 18 months . And Xerox will lay off 2,500 workers , or some 2.5% , by mid- 1992 . <P> The latest wave of cutbacks follows similar steps by IBM , Citicorp and Kodak .
