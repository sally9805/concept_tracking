It was like a Republican Convention . Everything worked . The words were good . The television was good . The propaganda , especially , was good  --  in fact astonishingly good for a party forced to accept a wrenching philosophical tug off its traditional moorings . The also-rans , assigned supporting roles , performed as if they were claiming the prize , with only the habitually cranky Brown proffering a ( predictable ) sour note . <P> The Democrats did it , and they were rewarded . The bounce was theirs , the biggest in 50 years . But the Candidate has been a front runner before , and he fully expects to be playing catch-up again . So he smiled and went along and shared in the wonder  --  but the Candidate is a realist and he knows it . So he said , quietly and almost to himself , " It wo n't be easy . Bush is wrong about most things , but he was right when he said this is a weird year . " <P> There was , however , one survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he got it . According to his campaign 's own research , which has been famously rigorous and appropriately pessimistic , the number of people willing to think of Clinton as President has gone through the roof . That was the week 's goal , a " mission defined " and a " mission accomplished , " to borrow the words of the man Clinton would replace . " It 's confirmed , " Clinton was told last Friday . " We have our second chance . The playing field has been leveled . " <P> Clinton 's success in New York City was the product of three carefully plotted moves . The first , the culmination of a long and dictatorially controlled process , was the creation of a platform that moves the Democratic Party unambiguously to the political center . The second , the 14-min. biographical film that preceded Clinton 's acceptance speech , began the arduous task of creating empathy for a candidate carrying enough political baggage to fill a container ship . The third , the acceptance address itself  --  well crafted and eloquently delivered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous strikes at Bush . Clinton 's mocking disparagement of Bush 's disdain for " the vision thing " signaled the beginning of a bruising , take- no-prisoners campaign whose outcome may be decided , in the words of a Bush aide , with a low turnout of turned-off voters who disgustedly choose the " least worst alternative . " <P> One of those alternatives vanished last week as Ross Perot shut down his campaign with all the brutality of a plant manager pink-slipping loyal workers at Christmas . His method confirmed the worst assessments of his character . Without warning , Perot stranded the millions who had poured themselves into his effort , whom he had repeatedly promised to " serve " selflessly if only they would follow his lead .
