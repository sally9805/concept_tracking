A new student  --  Stephanie Adams  --  stopped by Professor O'Reilly 's office that day , and what she wanted him to do was preposterous . She was a striking , blond-haired girl with large eyes , a small , rather prim mouth , and a bright , nervous manner . What she hoped to persuade him to do would ordinarily have been easy to provide : a recommendation for a summer program , an internship , to do newspaper work in New York . However , she had not yet taken any of his courses . In fact , he had never seen her before in his life . <p> Still , she expected him to recommend her to do this " great favor " for her in spite of the unusual circumstances , because she was certain that , without his help , she would have no chance of being accepted . She would take the necessary courses from him the following semester , she promised . He would find out that she was a talented writer upon whom a strong recommendation had not been wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week that her life 's work was to be as a journalist . She had been rushing around trying to find out if there was still time to cram in the necessary courses and graduate on time , and , luckily , she found she could just manage it . She sighed and touched her hair and gave him a supplicating look . But the internship was truly indispensable . She would do anything to convince ' him , absolutely anything . <p> Ordinarily , O'Reilly would have given her an apologetic no , but partly because of her hopefulness and energy , and partly because he did n't want to squelch her enthusiasm if she was , in fact , going to become a new major , he agreed to read the two papers she had brought along as examples of her work and let her know the next day if he could , in good conscience , write to the newspaper people in her behalf . <p> " Oh , wonderful , " she cooed . " I just had a feeling you would understand . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went over at home that night after dinner , were a disappointment . They had been submitted for an education course and were full of social science jargon , poorly phrased . They were not only badly written but carelessly punctuated . The education professor had given her an A- on one of them and had written a number of fatuous , irrelevant remarks in the margins in red pencil . He shook his head in disbelief and tried to think of a tactful way to decline her request . <p> But when she came to his office the next day , she was wearing a lemon-yellow sweater in some very soft fiber , mohair or cashmere , and her light blond hair falling across her shoulders reminded him of an engraving he had seen of some classical heroine , Penelope or Andromeda . She was beautiful . She was wearing a wool skirt and expensive-looking toeless pumps with her elegant , perfectly painted toes just visible in a bright stylish enamel . She seemed older and looked extremely professional . She seemed to have dressed up expressly for the occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional journalist . She was so certain that her papers were marvelous , so certain that he would now be eager to perform his necessary role in the launching of her embryonic career , that instead of finding the words to say no to her , he found himself agreeing to write a letter . <p> He did n't want her to get her hopes up too high , he said , but he would do his best under the circumstances . He wanted her to realize that she would be competing against students from other schools who had had extensive coursework and possibly several years of experience writing for campus newspapers , but all that seemed to matter to her was that she had gained his consent  --  that was all she could hope for , she said , under the circumstances  --  and she was delighted . <p> Later , faced with the chore of how to write the actual letter , which would have to be one lie after another , he was ashamed of himself . He knew he should never have agreed to such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweating away and feeling like a fool ; and the way he accomplished it , finally , was to write the recommendation as if he were fondly remembering one of his brightest students , saying all the necessary things . <p> As he explained in his letter to the Dean : When the invitation from Brockton College came in the mail , he had been working on ideas for Stephanie Adams 's independent study project .... The invitation came from a young assistant professor at Brockton , Mary Fowler , whom he had met once , briefly , at a journalism convention , and who , somewhat mistakenly , had the notion that he was one of the powers in the field . He was flattered , of course , and could use the extra money offered by the honorarium , but he did n't travel often these days to give lectures . This school was a five- or six-hour drive , too far , he thought , for a comfortable trip . He had n't taken any long drives since his wife had died . He was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had a brainstorm : it occurred to him that here might be a novel way to give Stephanie Adams some practical experience for her independent study project . <p> His proposal , which he explained to Stephanie , was that she could come along as his assistant . She would photograph and tape-record the lecture and attempt to " cover " the event as if she were on assignment for a real newspaper or magazine . This would give her an opportunity to find out if she liked the sort of work that a reporter was called upon to do . She could write it up as one of her assignments for his independent study course , and he would also be able to pay her a small sum for her trouble from a budget he had available for student assistance . Her presence would make the drive down less tedious for him . Stephanie seemed delighted by the offer and said she thought she could " really get into " a trip like that , so he went ahead and accepted the speaking date for mid-February . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he picked her up at her dorm on the day of the trip to Brockton , she seemed in a sullen mood . The collar of her beige coat was turned up against the wind , and she could n't quite manage a smile when he greeted her . He held open the passenger 's door for her and then carefully tucked her suitcase into the trunk beside his briefcase and overnighter and slammed the lid and got in . " We 're off , " he said . The sky was overcast , but he was looking forward to the trip and feeling cheerful , even exuberant . He had no idea why she was so down-in-the-mouth  --  maybe a falling-out with her boyfriend or roommate or maybe just the weather , who could tell ? Girls her age were sometimes unpredictably moody . <p> Often , in the past , when his wife was still alive , he could coax her out of a depression by a persistent display of kidding and sympathy and his own good spirits . But , in spite of his joviality and best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephanie did not respond . If anything , she clammed up all the more , often staring out the side window so that when he glanced over at her all he could see was the back of her blond head , with its perfect part and the elegant folds of hair swooping down across her shoulders . He began to wonder if he had done something to offend her , but , for the life of him , he could not imagine what it might be . <p> She was an amazingly attractive girl , beautiful really , according to all the customary definitions . He had a harder time knowing now whether girls of her age were beautiful or not . Some of them who seemed beautiful to him at first , on the first day in class , for instance , later began to seem quite ordinary ; and he realized that they were probably just young and fresh-faced and did not seem particularly beautiful to their peers , and might , in fact , be unpopular and unappreciated and  --  simply not beautiful . <p> The truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died only last year . He noticed that Stephanie Adams was an attractive girl , of course . But she was his student , someone he scarcely knew outside of a classroom-and-office situation , and she was so young , impossible for him to take seriously at his age . She was so nearly a child , had so recently been merely a child ; she was scarcely formed , immature , a blank slate . O'Reilly felt he was perfectly safe from so transient a factor as beauty . He had already navigated in those waters and crossed the bar into respectable middle age . <p> So many of the young women he taught , like Stephanie Adams , were attractive , receptive , malleable  --  they were at the most nubile of ages . He was not stupid or numb , and he appreciated their inherent attractiveness , but always abstractly , as if from a great distance , as one might appreciate a collection of beautiful vases . He had once seen a Picasso exhibit in Boston , infact , that included some enormous , life-size vases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great licentious craftiness and style . From a distance , they resembled statues of sensuous women . It was only on closer inspection that one could see they were actually just huge droll vases , capable of holding a quantity of flower stalks or reeds or umbrellas , and that , because they were museum pieces , they were , of course , empty . <p> While once , within recent memory , he had identified quite closely with his students , now they seemed members of some alien tribe or species , whose arrogance and cheerfulness and intense , obvious needs often seemed absurd , and whose beauty was akin to pottery or the exotic markings of some nearly extinct strain of bird life one might read about in National Geographic , occasionally astonishing but so universal within the genotype as to be unremarkable . In his vocation , professors kept getting older and older , but students stayed the same age . The illusion was that his clients were getting younger and younger , as if he were gazing at them through the wrong end of a telescope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived under the same roof with her for twenty years , and he had watched her change from the young , heartbreakingly lovely girl he had married into a handsome woman of middle age , and he had watched her die , and he had never once regretted marrying her . That was true  --  he never had  --  in spite of the usual tiffs and misunderstandings , the usual adjustments . Surely that was exceptional . He could see her Iying on the couch in the limp , delicate way she did at the end , l looking so incredibly sad and resigned . He would come up to her and take her face in his hands and pat her cheeks softly and pretend to kiss her nose , and he could see her eyes turning up at the corners , cutting through the desolate expression that had been there the moment before . To press her body against his felt like touching some angelic power of healing , something nearly divine , yet she could not heal herself and he could not heal her  --  no one could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the same again . He knew that as surely as he knew anything in the world . <p> Now , for a few minutes , for some reason he could not put his finger on , this girl , Stephanie Adams , reminded him of his wife , and he felt unreasonably happy because of it . of course , he knew it was only an illusion . There was scarcely any resemblance at all , nothing to support the momentary elation . When they finally pulled up to the Holiday Inn in Brockton , his own emotional state was beginning to slide . <p> The faculty sponsor for his appearance Professor Mary Fowler , was supposed to be ready to meet them at the Holiday Inn upon arrival , provide a schedule and a tour of campus , and see to Ms. Adams 's dormitory accommodations . O'Reilly called the number he had been given from the lobby phone but received no answer . After several tries with no better luck , he decided to check in and try again from his room . He was tired from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wanted nothing more than to collapse for a while and go over his lecture . But , of course , he could n't leave Stephanie sitting in the lobby , so he explained what had happened and invited her to come back to his room and wait there . " I 'm not at all surprised , " she said wearily , as if she had already decided in advance that the day was going to be a total loss They walked down a long motel corridor covered with new-smelling , floral-patterned carpet , found the correct room ; and he unlocked the door and swung it open for her , then dragged in behind and set his bags down next to the bureau . <p> The room was quite large and airy with two queen-sized double beds and a sitting area beside the window with three comfortable chairs . It reminded him of a room in one of the convention hotels where one could conduct interviews or have drinks and pretend that you were not in a hotel room . The curtains were closed . Stephanie slumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " May I take your coat , " he said . <p> " No , " she said , a little petulantly , as if she thought he might insist . <p> " Still a little chilly , I guess , " he said . " Shall I turn the heat up ? " <p> " Whatever . " <p> He studied the thermostat and rotated its plastic wheel , then peeked out the window . <p> " A beautiful view of the parking lot , " he said , folding the curtain back into place . " Would you like something to eat or drink ? " <p> " No . " <p> " I 'm going to order something . " <p> " A rum and Coke , I guess . " <p> He tried Mary Fowler 's number again , with no success after twenty rings , then placed an order for two rum and Cokes and two bags of potato chips . <p> " I suppose I 'll end up staying here for the night , " she said . <p> " At the Holiday Inn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " They were supposed to put you up at one of the dorms , as I said . But if you 'd rather stay here , that 's okay , too . We 'll get it figured out , do n't worry . " <p> " I 'll bet . " <p> " Why are you in such a bad mood ? Do you mind talking about it ? " <p> " I 'm not really . This is the way I usually am  --  the real me . " <p> " If you say so . " <p> " You might as well know the truth . " <p> " You just seemed a little down , that 's all . " <p> " Very perceptive , Dr. O'Reilly You 're a shrewd man . " <p> He dialed Mary Fowler 's number repeatedly , and let it ring and ring , but no one answered . Then he had the idea of phoning the journalism department , where someone did answer , a secretary who , it fumed out , had never heard of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange and alarming to him . Had he gotten the date wrong ? All the faculty members , she said , had already left for the day . Their offices were empty ; their doors were locked . He had no choice but to keep phoning the Fowler number until he could reach someone . <p> After the better part of an hour of this , until well after the drinks and potato chips arrived and while Stephanie waited impatiently , someone answered , a man 's voice.At first , he thought he had dialed the wrong number . the wrong number . But the voice fumed out to be that of Professor Fowler 's husband , just resumed from work . He informed O'Reilly that his wife regretted any inconvenience but that she had received a surprise offer for a job interview-in Alaska , of all places-and had had to leave town unexpectedly that afternoon-but that she had left preparations for his appearance in the hands of several of her students . He would no doubt be hearing from them shortly , the husband assured him . O'Reilly was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haphazard , everything thrown together at the last minute as Mary Fowler was hurriedly beating it out of town . The husband , clearly , was taking no responsibility for any of this and wanted nothing more than to hang up and go eat his TV dinner . He was barely polite . O'Reilly had no choice but to wait there with Stephanie , trying to make idle chitchat , until the students contacted him . <p> " You wo n't believe this , " he said when he hung up . " The woman who invited me here has gone to Alaska ! " <p> " You do n't have to lie , you know . " <p> " No kidding . I just talked to her husband . That 's what he said . " <p> Stephanie took a sip of her drink , then slid her finger slowly around the rim of the glass . " I know all about your reputation , " she said . " But I have n't decided yet what I 'm going to do about it . " <p> O'Reilly thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired and a little drunk , it seemed , maybe even a little on the neurotic side . Peculiar , he thought , that he had n't noticed any hint of it before . of course , he had n't known her for very long , and up until then their relationship had been quite formal . What did she mean , his " reputation " ? <p> So far as he knew , he did n't have a " reputation , " or rather , his reputation was a good one at the small private college in central Ohio where he had worked for the past fifteen years , teaching primarily journalism courses . He was on the verge of being promoted to full professor , and that did n't happen without a good reputation . <p> After his wife died unexpectedly of breast cancer , he had passed through a period of bereavement and despondency , and he had been out of touch for a while with campus concerns , with faculty social life , and more distanced , too , from his students . He knew that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to focus on others ' perceptions and needs . But he did n't believe it had damaged his reputation . <p> He was still essentially the same man , more sad-faced and moody beneath his drooping mustache , dragging himself around campus like an old arthritic hound ; more apt to waste time zoning out in front of a ball game on TV with a beer on the armrest  --  just to clamp a lid on memory  --  but still idealistic in his own way , committed more than ever to his work , temperamentally somewhat shy and low-key actually , traits which were occasionally mistaken for aloofness , or , alternately , as timidity or weakness . <p> Students who tried to take advantage of this misapprehension by bullying O'Reilly soon learned they had misread the man . He was , in fact , disciplined and tenacious to the point of occasional stubbornness and inflexibility . But he was a fair-minded teacher . That had n't changed . He had been lucky enough to have been influenced by several exceptional teachers himself , and he had , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own and built upon them . He was well-liked by many of his students when they got to know him , and he was quite close to a few of them , but always in the role of a mentor and friend , nothing else . of course , in a small community , there were always rumors concerning hanky-panky of various sorts . Maybe she had picked up on some ridiculous rumor . <p> It was his opinion that the " lecherous professor " of popular mythology , who traded grades for sexual favors , was pure myth , or at least , so rare as to hardly constitute a valid statistical probability . He resented the stereotype because it tended to discredit the profession . Students sometimes developed crushes , and gossiped about them , but these were , after all , typical of adolescence and not to be taken seriously . If they did n't fixate on one of their teachers , it was just as likely to be some rock star or professional athlete , someone safe and unattainable to fuel their fantasies until they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely a sign of abstract admiration or even of engagement or excitement with the subject matter , which the student confused with " love , " in which case , seen from his point of view , the emotion could have a positive side that merely needed focusing . After twenty years of teaching , he imagined he had dealt with just about every shading that such attachments might take . <p> A loud knocking at the door caused Stephanie to start . <p> " Oh , hurray ! " she said bitterly . " It must be them . " <p> O'Reilly got up to answer it . <p> Three young men were standing out in the hall . When they found they had come to the right room , each of them shook hands with O'Reilly The one wearing a crooked polyester tie seemed to be the spokesman . He was heavyset and had muscular shoulders and looked uncomfortable in the button-down shirt . <p> " Oh , sorry , " he said as they filed in , " we did n't know you brought your wife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no , " O'Reilly said . " This is Stephanie Adams . She 's a journalism student in our department who has come along to observe . " <p> " Oh , sorry , " the boy said again , in a tone that sounded , perhaps unintentionally , sarcastic . He winked at the others and moved toward Stephanie to shake hands , beaming an Ultra Brite smile at her that was off-center and dangerous . <p> " We 're so glad you could come , " Stephanie said , in a tone only slightly less aloof than one might have expected from a member of the royal family . <p> During his presentation , he noticed Stephanie had forgotten to turn on the tape recorder . He did n't want to interrupt the flow to signal to her , but he was hoping to use the tape as a basis for starting an article ( as he had emphasized to her ) , so he was greatly relieved when , about twenty minutes into his talk , she remembered and clicked on the machine . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephanie would scribble a note on her pad or she would raise the camera to her face , stare at him fixedly through the viewfinder , her lips screwed up in a sullen little scowl , and snap the shutter . She was going through the motions but she was certainly not enjoying herself ; her misery was evident for anyone to see . She acted as if she found the work in some way demeaning . Though she was sitting up front near the boys who had served as their hosts , it had taken her about five seconds to size them up as rubes and creeps , and she had spoken scarcely a word to any of them since reaching that conclusion . ' <p> Did beautiful women have the same problems as ordinary women ? Perhaps they were more irritable because they scared away the men , made them feel inadequate . A girl this beautiful , you automatically assumed she was already spoken for . If you were a kid , you might not even try to get to know her for that reason . or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fend off passes so often that they grew cynical , assuming all men were " after " them in some sense and could n't be trusted . Early on , they would develop all the signals that said " Keep your distance " and " Go away and leave me alone . " Was this Stephanie 's problem ' he wondered . <p> The Brockton students had no information about arrangements for Stephanie to stay in the dorms  --  probably Mary Fowler had n't gotten around to that  --  so afterwards , O'Reilly asked Stephanie if she would have any problem coming back to the Holiday Inn with him . He was afraid she might be disappointed to miss the chance to be in the dorms and to meet other students , but after the way she treated the Brockton students , he doubted it . <p> " Why not , " she said , " it 's just a bed , " as if she still believed , for some reason , that these arrangements were part of some elaborate deception on his part , for some purpose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered just about enough of her snottiness for one day . When they got back to the Inn , he marched her up to the front desk and said , " Give this young lady a room , " and he paid for it and told her he would meet her at the desk in five minutes with her luggage . on his way back down the long hall with her things , he saw her standing outside one of the doors and she motioned for him to deposit the bags inside , which he did , then paused momentarily at the door in order to make plans for leaving in the morning . <p> Stephanie said she was sorry but she had some bad news for him : she had forgotten to turn on the tape recorder until about halfway through his lecture . <p> He said he had noticed . " You did n't seem to be enjoying yourself much tonight , " o'Reilly said . <p> " It 's not exactly exhilarating work , is it ? " <p> " It 's work , if that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the assignment . " <p> " Writing it up , you mean , or inviting you in for a nightcap ? " Her eyes snapped at him as if to register some point that should now be understood between them , but he was afraid he had missed the point , whatever it was . He was tired . Was she inviting him in or telling him to buzz off ? He was not at all sure he wanted to know . It was not a message he felt , she needed to communicate . Why did she think she had to treat him like an eighteen-year-old7 He certainly was n't going in , he knew that much . He intended to excuse himself and go to bed . <p> " The writing , " O'Reilly said . <p> " I doubt if I 'll do much better at that either . " <p> " Why do you say that ? " <p> " You do n't know ? " <p> " No . " <p> " I was rejected by the Newspaper Fund . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " That recommendation of yours must have really done the trick , Dr. O'Reilly " <p> " It must have , " he said , shaking his head , then realizing she was n't kidding . Her eyes were welling up with tears . " You do n't think that was the reason , do you ? You do n't think I would do that to someone , do you ? " <p> " It would n't surprise me in the least , " she said . <p> " Thanks a lot . " <p> " No , I suppose it was a variety of factors , " she said , dabbing angrily at her eyelids . <p> " It 's a very competitive program . I 'm sure there were a lot of good people who did n't make it , " he said . <p> " I suppose . " <p> " Maybe you could try again next year . " <p> " Maybe you could write me another stunning recommendation . " <p> " Well , I am sorry it did n't work out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She broke into tears and fumed to close the door but instead bumped awkwardly into his shoulder , holding on for a moment and muffling her sniffles into his coat sleeve . <p> " Better call it a night , " he said , patting her arm in a paternal way , keeping her at a distance . " Things will look better in the morning We can talk about it some more . " <p> The winds blew ferociously all night long , and the weather report in the morning predicted a rapid drop in the temperature and a blockbuster snowstorm heading toward them , with gale warnings and severe conditions and travelers ' advisories . O'Reilly rushed to get underway before the storm hit , but the snow was soon falling , and the trip back took them until late afternoon , a hard drive through the worst blizzard of the season . Stephanie was as uncommunicative as she had been the day before , and he was distracted by the bad weather , fighting the wind and the white-outs just to keep the car on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected application but thought it might be better to let it rest . By the time O'Reilly pulled up in front of Stephanie 's dormitory and let her out and watched her dash inside , it was a good ten inches deep and still blowing , and his wheels got stuck in the slush next to a drainage grate and dug in . He was mired there , foundering in the drifts , exhausted and embarrassed alternately spinning his tires and hopping out to claw and kick at the snow , in full view of a thousand windows outside her dormitory , trying hopelessly to free himself , until finally three boys happened past , looking very much like the ones who had come to his rescue the day before . They lowered their shoulders and cried " Heave-ho " and off he chugged , at long last , into the teeth of the storm , waving his thanks and watching them wave back . <p> As winter slowly ebbed , Stephanie appeared at his office for her twice-a-week conferences for her independent study course . From his office window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges of snow , her blond curls tucked into the fur-trimmed hood of a melon-colored ski jacket . When she arrived , threw her coat across the rack , and sat down in the chair beside his desk , her cheeks glowed . Her disposition was never predictable  --  she was alternately sullen , buoyant , rude , or ingratiating  --  but during those weeks she did seem , gradually , to have forgiven him for whatever it was she imagined he had done to ruin her chances for the internship She always looked as if she had just stepped fresh from the shower , then spent two hours putting on her face , taking special trouble with her mascara and eyeliner , her hair , her clothes . <p> Unfortunately , it began to be clear to O'Reilly that she did not spend the corresponding time and effort on her assignments for him . Her articles were often late , and they were neither polished nor very interesting or perceptive . She had started out by reading an article in Cosmopolitan , one of her favorite magazines , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the piece , but her article  --  on " Who Gets Ahead and Why "  --  was vague and vacuous and full of dubious conclusions in addition to taking an amazingly condescending and self-important tone . Then when she read articles in The Atlantic , The New York Times Magazine , and Saturday Review at his suggestion , and tried to imitate their more intellectual or objective styles , she kept repeating the same patronizing , overly familiar tone of the first assignment . <p> When he tried to show her where she was getting off the track , she seemed not to get the point and to stubbornly resist his suggestions for revision , as if she knew better than he did what was necessary . She thought she knew what the young , hip generation of which she was a part wanted to read and how they wanted it to sound . She implied that he was stodgy and out-of-date and too concerned with style , with research and factual data . She used the incomplete tape recording as an excuse to avoid altogether writing the report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notes . It became increasingly obvious to O'Reilly that she had no aptitude for the work , not even very much interest in it , and that she did not accept criticism well , even when offered in the most tactful and generous ways . <p> Toward the end of the semester , she informed him that she realized her enthusiasm for journalism had been premature , that what she wanted to be now , her " true destiny , " she felt sure , was a high-level executive . She could see herself working for some major corporation , IBM or Chase Manhattan , she said , in some managerial role , though she knew that would be difficult since she was a woman and there were incredible sexist barriers out there to overcome . She had just read a wonderful book called The Female Executive and another one called Winning Through Intimidation , and these had given her a whole new perspective on herself and the possibilities that lay ahead . She knew she had to take charge of her life now and be more assertive in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just that . <p> O'Reilly listened carefully . He was n't clear what her future in the business world might be , but he was relieved she had ruled out journalism because , so far as he could ascertain , she would have made a mediocre journalist at best . If his course had helped her find that out , he concluded that it had probably been worth the price of admission . A few weeks later , when it came time to assign grades for the semester , he went over her papers again , wavering between a C+ and a B- , and finally decided on a B- , preferring to err in the direction of generosity . <p> A few days later , during finals , Stephanie came storming into his office , and he knew by the peevish expression on her face even before she opened her mouth that she must have found out her grade , which he had posted on his door with the others . She slumped into the chair beside his desk and glared at him . <p> " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that course after all the work I put in ! " <p> Yes , he did , he said . It was no mistake . He told her he knew she had undoubtedly worked hard but that his evaluation also had to cover the quality of the work and her overall progress and to compare it with others who had taken the same course . It was his standard reply . He did n't feel she had worked very hard , in fact , but maybe she thought she had . <p> " So now you 're telling me I 'm stupid , suppose . " <p> " Not at all . . . " He told her the grade was simply a measure of her performance in this particular instance , not a comment on her overall intelligence . " And , really , I do n't know what you are so upset about . is a perfectly respectable grade . " <p> " Not when I earned an A , it 's not . " <p> He told her that , unfortunately , he was the person who decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she deserved a 13 , and , in his opinion , that was a generous evaluation , in her case . <p> " In your opinion ! " <p> " In my opinion . " " What would get you to change your opinion ? Anything ? " <p> " Not at this point , I 'm afraid . The grade is already recorded . " <p> " You 're telling me there is absolutely nothing I can do to change that grade . " <p> He told her he thought she would be far better off to try to understand why she had received the grade rather than to try to justify herself by blaming it on him . <p> " I think I know the reason all too well . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " Does that mean you wo n't change the grade ? " <p> " I wo n't change the grade . " <p> " If you were n't such a sexist snob , there would n't be any problem about this grade , did you know that ? " <p> He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , was with her performance , not with his evaluation of it , and until she acknowledged that possibility he said he did n't know how she could expect to improve her work in the future . <p> " I would n't want to improve according to your terms , believe me , Dr. O'Reilly The problem is that I did n't smile enough and brown-nose you the way everyone else does . " <p> " Unfortunately , I do not give grades for smiling , although some people persist in thinking that I do . If I did , I 'm sure you would have received an A. " <p> " Goddamn you ! Sure , I would have . That or gone to bed with you in that Holiday Inn . That 's what you wanted , is n't it ? " <p> " Stephanie , you can keep bringing up irrelevant points all day long , and it 's not going to change anything . I think you had better go home and cool off . " <p> " That was my biggest mistake right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Reilly and now you 're making me pay for it . " <p> " If you would like to bring your papers back in and sit down with me in a sensible frame of mind , Stephanie , we can go over them again and I will try to give you a detailed explanation of why you received a B- . As it is , I do n't think we 're getting anywhere . " She stood up quickly and squinted at him with such unremitting hatred that he would n't have been surprised if she had spat in his face . <p> " I have no intention of bringing in my papers again and sitting around your stupid office being bored while you stare up my skirt . " <p> " Either way , it 's up to you . " <p> " You bastard , " she said under her breath and fumed and marched out the door . <p> Well , it was too bad that she had gotten so upset . He regretted it , but he was n't going to change the grade , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what could he have done ? It was a professional liability , this occasional confrontation over grades , and one part he disliked most about his job . <p> In Strickland 's musty office as Strickland sat puffing on his pipe and staring out the window , O'Reilly read Stephanie 's letter . Stephanie described how , in utter frustration , she had actually gone to see the Dean to complain about O'Reilly unprofessional conduct . " I responded unfavorably to what I see as an entire semester of seduction , " she said , " and was punished academically for it . " <p> According to Stephanie , O'Reilly tried to get her drunk in a motel room on a trip to Brockton College . He tried to get her to spend the night in his motel room . He told her she could n't have an A in his journalism course unless she slept with him .... How could she lie so blatantly ? What had he done to deserve this ? According to Stephanie , he was guilty of leaving his grade book in plain sight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Strickland was a fussy , gossipy , excitable little man with pointed , ratlike ears and the physical mannerisms of an elderly woman . He had postponed saying anything about it , he told O'Reilly until he had had a chance to discuss it with other senior members of the department . They had never had a case quite like it before , he said , at least not since he had been chairperson , and certainly never involving a candidate for promotion to full professor . He affected great concern and an open mind , then asked to hear O'Reilly " version " of what had happened . When O'Reilly told him , Strickland 's face showed a barely repressed incredulity . <p> Strickland did n't like him , he knew that . Strickland had been one of the few senior members of the department , O'Reilly had heard on good authority , who had voted against O'Reilly promotion . But to be enjoying O'Reilly embarrassment as much as he obviously was seemed crude and uncivilized , not to mention ominous <p> So far as O'Reilly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had had ample reason . He had never given Strickland any special reason to dislike him , though privately , he regarded Strickland as an inflated old windbag His area of specialization was fairly far removed from Strickland 's , so it might have been said that they had little in common professionally . But the same was true of many of his other colleagues without anything like the same uncomfortable sense of enmity . <p> Strickland , who had never published anything , was especially critical of O'Reilly publications . Whenever O'Reilly published something , Strickland invariably saw it as " merely journalism " or as evidence of self-interest . Strickland was presumably dedicated only to the welfare of the institution as a whole , not to flaunting his own work . As a dedicated altruist , he had made campus politics his chief concern for thirty years , he knew everyone , and his opinions carried a great deal of influence . " So you think it 's a case of someone going off half-cocked , " Strickland was saying . <p> " I think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which now borders on . . . slander . " <p> " Thank you for your input , " Strickland said . He stood up and ushered O'Reilly toward the door , after suggesting that O'Reilly put everything in writing for the Dean 's benefit since O'Reilly would , of course , be seeing the Dean first thing on Monday morning . Strickland had already made the appointment . <p> O'Reilly had never been suicidal before that weekend , but shortly after his meeting with Strickland he began to comprehend the urge for suicide , for oblivion , in a new way . Saturday was a haze of writing , walking , and recriminations , of cup after cup of burning coffee and long-winded lectures to unwilling imaginary audiences . Then the better part of Sunday afternoon he spent alternately sitting in a small park near the local gorge and gazing at the river below from a dizzying height as he leaned against the guard rail on the suspension bridge and tried to think of reasons why he should not jump . The hum of the water and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline were hypnotic . He could so easily imagine the long swimming down through the air , the flapping descent like an awkward dive , the sudden , thrilling speed and emptiness , the senses lost in , the whirl and the warm wind and the distant foam , and the absence , the release . Would he want to stop halfway down and change his mind ? He thought not . If he stood there too long , he feared he would feel the desire to leap rising into his mouth like the metallic taste of lust . He got into his car and drove rapidly away . <p> The Dean greeted O'Reilly warmly and then sat down at his matched wood-grain desk to read O'Reilly 's letter . An attractive vase containing fresh-cut flowers was positioned on one marble sill , and the lawns beyond the Dean 's windows , which faced front campus , were suddenly dense with students changing classes . The Dean was such a brisk dapper , well-balanced man , he made O'Reilly feel shaggy and tired . In the spotless , well-appointed office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory inlaid letter opener lying there ready for use , O'Reilly hold on reality felt wafer-thin , in danger of slipping away . <p> " Miss Stephanie Adams 's letter ( which I have just read for the first time ) is a ludicrous fabrication based upon , but frequently departing from , an accurate account of her acquaintance with me , " his letter began . Was any of it believable ? <p> After reading O'Reilly letter and asking a number of questions , especially about O'Reilly intentions to sue the girl if she persisted in defaming him , the Dean took the position that O'Reilly had clearly been wronged and that he should be protected from further insult in every way possible . " A lawsuit , however , is not a good idea , " the Dean warned . " Such cases are the devil to prove , and all you end up with is a lot of unfavorable publicity , both for you and for the institution . And , of course , the expense can be overwhelming . " O'Reilly agreed . <p> The Dean was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Professional Standards Committee , however , which was then in the process of considering O'Reilly promotion , though , of course , O'Reilly letter of defense ( which was enormously persuasive , in the Dean 's opinion ) could also be included . He was certain that one isolated complaint of this kind was not a sufficient basis to bring O'Reilly up before the Committee on Termination for Cause . <p> Since Stephanie Adams had indicated to the Dean that several other young women who had worked for O'Reilly as assistants had complained privately to her that they had been harassed by O'Reilly the Dean had instructed the associate dean in charge of on-campus employment to look into these allegations and to keep track of any other complaints that might be made in the future . The Dean was pleased to say that the associate dean had turned up no evidence against O'Reilly whatsoever , only good reports , but he still felt it necessary to warn O'Reilly that any additional complaints would have to be taken very seriously . <p> When O'Reilly expressed his alarm at the spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cause to learn about his predicament with all its potential for damage to him , the Dean assured O'Reilly that he had , of course , emphasized the need for confidentiality when he had spoken to the associate dean and to the chairman of the Professional Standards Committee , and , believing in the professionalism of his colleagues , the Dean was reasonably sure that O'Reilly had nothing to worry about in that respect , though , needless to say , it was a regrettable situation and put O'Reilly in a very difficult position he realized that , no matter what others might do to try to help him and to clear his name . <p> The Dean advised patience and forbearance , on O'Reilly part , and " waiting it out " and assured him of his continuing support . O'Reilly thanked him , shook the offered hand , and drifted out of the Dean 's office and down the long hall with its gilt-framed paintings of dead benefactors and former presidents of the college , who seemed to be judging him with their stem , intense faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in the hall or across campus , as he headed toward class , knew or thought they knew that O'Reilly was a lecher and a disgrace , and there was not one word he could utter , not a thing he could do , to change it . For years afterwards , O'Reilly carried this knowledge like another form of bereavement . At first , it was like a knot in the pit of his stomach , but eventually it was like an old wound he would sometimes aggravate purposely just to call forth the memory of the anguish and despair he was feeling now . Because however much it throbbed and festered as he lugged it around the campus or around the drab , anonymous streets of the city where he eventually settled to work as a reporter for a second-rate newspaper , at least it let him know he was still alive and reminded him vividly of the life he had left behind . <p> <p> By Joe David Bellamy <p>                  @ @ @
