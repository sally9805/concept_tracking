Today 's turkey guns and loads have come home to roost  --  and they 're doing so on their own branch of the family tree . There was a time , not so long ago , when writing about guns and loads for turkeys was as simple as writing a grocery list . After all , because most states only allowed shotguns for turkey hunting , the best advice one could pass along to the gobbler-calling brethren was to get oneself a Full Choke gun , try a few different loads on the pattern board , then go forth and think like a turkey . Back then there was n't really such a thing as a sure " nuff turkey shotgun , just duck and goose guns that flung patterns tight enough to perforate a gobbler 's head at 40 paces or , hopefully , a bit beyond . This began to change just a few years ago when a true turkey gun began to evolve , and when the evolutionary process is complete , a modern turkey gun will be a distinctly recognizable piece of hunting equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , a flat-shooting varmint rig from an old-fashioned deer rifle . The evolution seems to have started back about a decade ago when Outdoor Life published a picture of what was considered the turkey gun of the future . It was a doctored photograph showing a pump gun with a Monte Carlo stock , an inch-high vent rib and , most radical of all , a stubby 24-inch barrel with a screw-in choke . As strange as that turkey gun of tomorrow may have looked , it was based on sound ideas . The high rib permitted not only better sighting , but improved lateral visibility ; the high comb aided eye alignment ; the short barrel made carrying more convenient and offered improved handling in the confines of a blind ; and the screw-in choke allowed much greater pattern versatility than ever possible with a fixed choke . Now it has come to pass that several gunmakers have not only borrowed these suggestions for the ultimate turkey gun , but have come up with some even better ideas of their own . To appreciate  --  and make effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must first escape the goose gun mind-set . For generations , the popular concept of a goose gun was a cannon of sorts with " Full Choke " written on its long barrel . Because the traditional 12 or 10-gauge magnum goose guns launched the heaviest payloads of shot and usually delivered the tightest patterns , it was logical to use these shotguns for turkey hunting . About two decades ago I wrapped a Model 1100 Remington 12-gauge magnum with camouflage tape and declared it my official turkey gun . At the time it did all I could have wished for , but by today 's standards it is only a striped goose gun because came alone does not a turkey gun make . The main difference is on the inside . My longtime hunting buddy Bill Bowman used to claim that he wanted a shotgun so tightly choked that it would " let the shot out one at a time . " Bill 's lament for the ultimate Full Choke was based on the common notion that delivering a tight pattern is a simple matter of increasing the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex than that . And this is why makers of traditional waterfowl guns have had to walk a tightrope between customers ' demands for tight chokes and the practical reality that good wingshooting performance is based on uniform pattern density with minimal shot stringing . In other words , given the vagaries and inevitable errors of range and lead estimation , a hunter will come home with more game if his shotgun delivers patterns that have ample shot density at the edges of the working pattern and if all of the shot pellets get to the target at about the same time . With the integral-choke shotguns of the past , a gunmaker knew that beyond a certain degree of choke constriction , patterns began to get uneven and shot strings became so long that the gun 's effectiveness on flying game went into a decline . All of this explains why waterfowl guns are choked as they are , and it also goes a long way toward explaining why today 's turkey guns are branching from the family tree . A gobbler strutting to your call is essentially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about having uniform pellet distribution out to the edges of your shot pattern . And even if your gun 's choke causes stringing of the shot swarm , a turkey wo n't have time to get out of the way in the fraction of an instant separating the arrival of the first and last pellets in the string . The shot will all be on target . What this means is that the traditional rules of shotgun choke do n't apply to turkey guns . Thus , no only can we break the old taboos , but we can make those same taboos work in our favor . That is why when I pattern-test turkey guns and loads , I do n't even bother with the traditional pattern-testing method of counting the pellets that strike in a 30-inch circle when fired from 40 yards . All I care about is the number of pellets that hit a target profile of a gobbler 's head and neck . This means that I 'm looking for a load-and-choke combination that delivers a high ratio of shot density at the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern are essentially useless to the turkey hunter because there is no need to make allowances for errors in leading the target . Look at it this way : In a 1-5/8-ounce load of No. 5 shot , there are about 275 pellets . Of these , only about a dozen or so in the center of your pattern are going to get the job done , so the best way to make the pattern more efficient is to put more pellets in the center ; and be able to put the densest part of the pattern where you want it . Screw-in chokes are pretty much the answer for pattern control with your turkey gun . Nowadays , nearly all shotgun makers offer guns with the screw-in choke feature , and in addition to the usual wingshooting chokes , some manufacturers offer extra-tight turkey tubes . These special tubes are usually marked " Turkey Choke " and are designed to deliver tighter center densities than the standard Full Choke that we use for long-range wingshooting . Also , there are after-market suppliers such as Hastings ( Box 224 , Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most popular makes and models of shotguns . To give you an idea of how scientific the business of turkey chokes has become , Hastings offers not just one screw-in turkey choke , but as many as eight special turkey tubes for a single make and model of gun . For a 12-gauge gun , these tubes cover a range of choke constrictions from .675 inch to .640 inch . To put these measurements in perspective , consider that the traditional choke constriction in a 12-gauge Full Choke barrel is about .040 inch . This is the so-called 40 points of choke that shotgunners often talk about . With Hastings ' tightest turkey tube , the constriction is a whopping 90 ( .090 inch ) points of choke ! Finding , or developing , the combination of choke , ammunition and shot size that delivers the densest pattern is a lot like working up an accurate handload for a rifle . But rather than trying different bullets and propellants to discover which combination produces the tightest groups , you try different combinations of shot and tubes to learn which delivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included , long suffered from what I call the turkey hunter 's dilemma  --  the dilemma being the choice between using small shot , which yields a denser pattern , and large shot , which hits harder but at the cost of skimpier patterns . With today 's super-tight turkey tubes , it is possible to have tighter patterns with larger shot . So when you 're doing pattern-testing with a turkey tube , you might try a size or two larger shot than in the past . And by all means try the special turkey loads now being made by U.S. ammo manufacturers . With extra-hard pellets , buffered charges and wider choices of shot sizes ( including in-shell combinations such as Remington 's Duplex loads ) , the new turkey loads ar light-years ahead of the waterfowl loads that we used to use . The 10-round packaging is convenient , too . When I pattern-test different loads , by the way , I continually increase the distance to the target until I find the outside yardage at which the choke-and-ammo combination will reliably put a killing pattern in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a sure kill when I 'm in the woods because I know my " dead zone " range . Earlier on I mentioned that one of the two ways to make a shot pattern more efficient is to put the densest part of the pattern where you want it . Back when I designed what was to be the turkey gun of the future , I installed an extra-high rib for better pointing and visibility , figuring that this would be about perfect for turkey hunting . But with the super-tight , high-center-density patterns that are possible with today 's chokes and loads , simply pointing a shotgun at the target often is n't good enough  --  or rather , it very well might not be close enough . To get the densest part of the pattern where you want it to hit , you need a way to aim it . That 's why Winchester 's ( U.S. Repeating Arms Company 's ) new Model 1300 turkey gun is available with adjustable rifle sights ! I expect that other gunmakers will follow suit as the popularity of turkey hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a lot of scopes on turkey guns . Already , scope makers are offering scopes with intermediate eye reliefs of about six inches , which makes them perfect for mounting on shotgun receivers or cantilevered scope mounting rails . This year Redfield is introducing a special 1X-to-4X shotgun scope that has a Realtree camo finish , and even camouflaged Redfield rings are available for your camo shotgun . My suggestion to scope makers is that they offer a special ring-shaped reticle that encircles a 10 or 12-inch-diameter area at 50 yards . This would correspond to the size of the densest part of a turkey pattern . Do n't despair if this report makes you feel that your favorite old gobbler getter is going out of style . My old Model 1100 goose gun has been brought up to date with a new Wad-Lock barrel from Hastings , which offers replacement barrels for several makes and models of shotguns . The Wad-Lock feature is a system of riflelike grooves in the bore , but the grooves are straight rather than twisting , which results in improved wad control and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hastings Wad-Lock yet , but I know that it works because similar grooved shotgun barrels were made by ace barrelmaker Bill Atkinson back in the 1970s . I tested them then , and pattern density was improved by more than 5 percent compared with ordinary smoothbores with the same choke . Today 's turkey takers have come into their own as guns built to serve in the spring ( or fall ) , and the evolution of these firearms will no doubt continue long into the future . <p>
