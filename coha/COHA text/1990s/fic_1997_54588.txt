The more things change , the more they stay the same . Or do they ? Two time travelers will find out for themselves in the latest story from the prolific author of Mars , Brothers , and many other novels and works of nonfiction . <p> Paris was not friendly to Americans in the soft springtime of 1922 . The French did n't care much for the English , either , and they hated the victorious Germans , of course . <p> I could n't blame them very much . The Great War had been over for more than three years , yet Paris had still not recovered its gaiety , its light and color , despite the hordes of boisterous German tourists who spent so freely on the boulevards . More likely , because of them . <p> I sat in one of the crowded sidewalk cafes beneath a splendid warm sun , waiting for my lovely wife to show up . Because of all the Germans , I was forced to share my minuscule round table with a tall , gaunt Frenchman who looked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American ? " he asked , looking down his prominent nose at me . His accent was worse than mine , certainly not Parisian . <p> " No , " I answered truthfully . Then I lied , " I 'm from New Zealand . " It was as far away in distance as my real birthplace was in time . <p> " Ah , " he said with an exhalation of breath that was somewhere between a sigh and a snort . " Your countrymen fought well at Gallipoli . Were you there ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I was too young . " <p> That apparently puzzled him . Obviously I was of an age to fight in the Great War . But in fact , I had n't been born when the British Empire troops were decimated at Gallipoli . I had n't been born in the twentieth century at all . <p> " Were you in the war ? " I asked needlessly . <p> " But certainly . To the very last moment I fought the Boche . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Americans betrayed us , " he muttered . <p> My brows rose a few millimeters . He was quite tall for a Frenchman , but painfully thin . Half starved . Even his eyes looked hungry . The inflation , of course . It cost a basketful of francs , literally , to buy a loaf of bread . I wondered how he could afford the price of an aperitif . Despite the warm afternoon he had wrapped himself in a shabby old leather coat , worn shiny at the elbows . <p> From what I could see there were hardly any Frenchmen in the cafe ; mostly raucous Germans roaring with laughter and heartily pounding on the little tables as they bellowed for more beer . To my amazement , the waiters had learned to speak German . <p> " Wilson , " my companion continued bitterly . " He had the gall to speak of Lafayette . " <p> " I thought that the American president was the one who arranged the armistice . " <p> " Yes , with his fourteen points . Fourteen daggers plunged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " The Americans should have entered the war on our side ! Instead they sat idly by and watched us bleed to death while their bankers extorted every gram of gold we possessed . " <p> " But the Americans had no reason to go to war , " I protested mildly . <p> " France needed them ! When their pitiful little colonies rebelled against the British lion , France was the only nation to come to their aid . They owe their existence to France , yet when we needed them they turned their backs on us . " <p> That was largely my fault , although he did n't know it . I averted the sinking of the Lusitania by the German U-boat . It took enormous energies , but my darling wife arranged it so that the Lusitania was crawling along at a mere five knots that fateful morning . I convinced Lieutenant Walther Schwieger , skipper of the U-20 , that it was safe enough to surface and hold the British liner captive with the deck gun while a boarding party searched for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The entire affair was handled with great tact and honor . No shots were fired , no lives were lost , and the 123 American passengers arrived safely in Liverpool with glowing stories of how correct , how chivalrous , the German U-boat sailors had been . America remained neutral throughout the Great War . Indeed , a good deal of anti-British sentiment swept the United States , especially the midwest , when their newspapers reported that the British were transporting military contraband in secret and thus risking the lives of American passengers . <p> " Well , " I said , beckoning to the waiter for two more Pernods , " the war is over and we must face the future as best we can . " <p> " Yes , " said my companion gloomily . " I agree . " <p> One group of burly Germans was being particularly obnoxious , singing bawdy songs as they waved their beer glasses to and fro , slopping the foaming beer on themselves and their neighboring tables . No one complained . No one dared to say a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My companion 's face was white with fury . Yet even he restrained himself . But I noticed that he glanced at the watch on his wrist every few moments , as if he were expecting someone . Or something . <p> If anyone had betrayed France , it was I. The world that I had been born into was a cesspool of violence and hate , crumbling into tribal savagery all across the globe . Only a few oases of safety existed , tucked in remote areas far from the filthy , disease-ridden cities and the swarms of ignorant , vicious monsters who raped and murdered until they themselves were raped and murdered . <p> Once they discovered our solar-powered city , tucked high in the Sierra Oriental , I knew that the end was near . Stupidly , they attacked us , like a wild barbarian horde . We slaughtered them with laser beams and heat-seeking bullets . Instead of driving them away , that only whetted their appetite . <p> Their survivors laid siege to our mountaintop . We laughed , at first , to think their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its high-tech weaponry and endless energy from the sun . Yet somehow they spread the word to others of their kind . Day after day we watched their numbers grow , a tattered , threadbare pack of rats surrounding us , watching , waiting until their numbers were so huge they could swarm us under despite our weapons . <p> They were united in their bloodlust and their greed . They saw loot and power on our mountaintop and they wanted both . At night I could see their campfires down below us , like the red eyes of rats watching and waiting . <p> Our council was divided . Some urged that we sally out against the besiegers , attack them and drive them away . But it was already too late for that . Their numbers were far too large , and even if we drove them away they would return , now that they knew we existed . <p> Others wanted to flee into space , to leave Earth altogether and build colonies off the planet . We had the technology to build and maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one technological step farther to build habitats in space . <p> But when we put the numbers through a computer analysis , it showed that to build a habitat large enough to house us all permanently would be beyond our current resources  --  and we could not enlarge our resource base as long as we were encircled by the barbarians . <p> I had worked on the time translator since my student days . It took enormous energy to move objects through time , far too much for all of us to escape that way . Yet I saw a possibility of hope . <p> If I could find a nexus , a pivotal point in time , perhaps I could change the world . Perhaps I could alter events to such an extent that this miserable world of terror and pain would dissolve , disappear , and a better world replace it . I became obsessed with the possibility . <p> " But you 'll destroy this world , " my wife gasped , shocked when I finally told her of my scheme . <p> " What of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful that you want it to continue ? " <p> She sank wearily onto the lab bench . " What will happen to our families ? Our friends ? What will happen to us ? " <p> " You and I will make the translation . We will live in an earlier , better time . " <p> " And the others ? " <p> I shrugged . " I do n't know . The mathematics is n't clear . But even if they disappear , the world that replaces them in this time will be better than the world we 're in now . " <p> " Do you really think so ? " <p> " We 'll make it better ! " <p> The fools on the council disagreed , naturally . No one had translated through time , they pointed out . The energy even for a preliminary experiment would be prohibitively high . We needed that energy for our weapons . <p> None of them believed I could change a thing . They were n't afraid that they would be erased from existence , their world line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blind ignorance they insisted that an attempt at time translation would consume so much energy that we would be left defenseless against the besieging savages outside our walls . <p> " The savages will no longer exist , " I told them . " None of this world line will exist , once I 've made the proper change in the world line . " <p> They voted me down . They would rather face the barbarians than give up their existence , even if it meant a better world would replace the one they knew . <p> I accepted their judgment outwardly . Inwardly I became the most passionate student of history of all time . Feverishly I searched the books and tapes , seeking the nexus , the turning point , the place where I could make the world change for the better . I knew I had only a few months ; the savage horde below our mountaintop was growing and stirring . I could hear their murmuring dirge of hate even through the walls of my laboratory , like the growls of a pack of wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was the war in the middle of the twentieth century that started the world 's descent into madness . A man called Adolph Hitler escalated the horror of war to new levels of inhumanity . Not only did he deliberately murder millions of civilian men , women and children ; he destroyed his own country , screaming with his last breath that the Aryan race deserved to be wiped out if they could not conquer the world . <p> When I first realized the enormity of Hitler 's rage I sat stunned for an entire day . Here was the model , the prototype , for the brutal , cruel , ruthless , sadistic monsters who ranged my world seeking blood . <p> Before Hitler , war was a senseless affront to civilized men and women . Soldiers were tolerated , at best ; often despised . They were usually shunned in polite society . After Hitler , war was commonplace , genocide routine , nuclear weapons valued for the megadeaths they could generate . <p> Hitler and all he stood for was the edge of the precipice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world had plunged into . If I could prevent Hitler from coming to power , perhaps prevent him from ever being born , I might save my world  --  or at least erase it and replace it with a better one . <p> For days on end I thought of how I might translate back in time to kill this madman or even prevent his birth . Slowly , however , I began to realize that this single man was not the cause of it all . If Hitler had never been born , someone else would have arisen in Germany after the Great War , someone else would have unified the German people in a lust for revenge against those who had betrayed and defeated them , someone else would have preached Aryan purity and hatred of all other races , someone else would have plunged civilization into World War II . <p> To solve the problem of Hitler I had to go to the root causes of the Nazi program : Germany 's defeat in the first world war , the war that was called the Great War by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany win that war . <p> If Germany had won World War I , there would have been no humiliation of the German people , no thirst for revenge , no economic collapse . Hitler would still exist , but he would be a retired soldier , perhaps a peaceful painter or even a minor functionary in the Kaiser 's government . There would be no World War II . <p> And so I set my plans to make Germany the victor in the Great War , with the reluctant help of my dear wife . <p> " You would defy the council ? " she asked me , shocked when I revealed my determination to her . <p> " Only if you help me , " I said . " I wo n't go unless you go with me . " <p> She fully understood that we would never be able to return to our own world . To do so , we would have to bring the components for a translator with us and then assemble it in the early twentieth century . Even if we could do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive years ? They were still using horses then . <p> Besides , our world would be gone , vanished , erased from spacetime . <p> " We 'll live out our lives in the twentieth century , " I told her . " And we 'll know that our own time will be far better than it is now . " <p> " How can you be sure it will be better ? " she asked me softly . <p> I smiled patiently . " There will be no World War II . Europe will be peaceful for the rest of the century . Commerce and art will flourish . Even the Russian communists will join the European federation peacefully , toward the end of the century . " <p> " You 're certain ? " <p> " I 've run the analysis on the master computer a dozen times . I 'm absolutely certain . " <p> " And our own time will be better ? " <p> " It has to be . How could it possibly be worse ? " <p> She nodded , her beautiful face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . Good riddance to it , I thought . But it was the only world we had ever known , and she was not happy to toss it away deliberately and spend the rest of her life in a bygone century . <p> Still , she never hesitated about coming with me . I would n't go without her , she knew that . And I knew that she would n't let me go unless she came with me . <p> " It 's really quite romantic , is n't it ? " she asked me , the night before we left . <p> " What is ? " <p> " Translating across time together . Our love will span the centuries . " <p> I held her close . " Yes . Across the centuries . " <p> Before sunrise the next morning we stole into the laboratory and powered up the translator . No one was on guard , no one was there to try to stop us . The council members were all sleeping , totally unaware that one of their loyal citizens was about to defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rebels . We had always accepted the council 's decisions and worked together for our mutual survival . <p> Until now . My wife silently took her place on the translator 's focal stage while I made the final adjustments to the controls . She looked radiant standing there , her face grave , her golden hair glowing against the darkened laboratory shadows . <p> At last I stepped up beside her . I took her hand@ it was cold with anxiety . I squeezed her hand confidently . <p> " We 're going to make a better world , " I whispered to her . <p> The last thing I saw was the pink glow of dawn rising over the eastern mountains , framed in the lab 's only window . <p> Now , in the Paris of 1922 that I had created , victorious Germany ruled Europe with strict but civilized authority . The Kaiser had been quite lenient with Great Britain ; after all , was he not related by blood to the British king ? Even France got off relatively lightly , far more lightly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but took no other territory . <p> France 's punishment was mainly financial : Germany demanded huge , crippling reparations . The real humiliation was that France was forced to disarm . The proud French army was reduced to a few regiments and forbidden modern armaments such as tanks and airplanes . The Parisian police force was better equipped . <p> My companion glanced at his watch again . It was the type that the army had issued to its officers , I saw . <p> " Could you tell me the time ? " I asked , over the drunken singing of the German tourists . My wife was late , and that was quite unlike her . <p> He paid no attention to me . Staring furiously at the Germans who surrounded us , he suddenly shot to his feet and shouted , " Men of France ! How long shall we endure this humiliation ? " <p> He was so tall and lean that he looked like a human Eiffel Tower standing among the crowded sidewalk tables . He had a pistol in his hand . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dropped his tray . It clattered to the pavement with a crash of shattered glassware . <p> But others were not surprised , I saw . More than a dozen men leaped up and shouted , " Vive La France ! " They were all dressed in old army uniforms , as was my companion , beneath his frayed leather coat . They were all armed ; a few of them even had rifles . <p> Absolute silence reigned . The Germans stared , dumbfounded . The waiters froze in their tracks . I certainly did n't know what to say or do . My only thought was of my beautiful wife ; where was she , why was she late , was there some sort of insurrection going on ? Was she safe ? <p> " Follow me ! " said the tall Frenchman to his armed compatriots . Despite every instinct in me , I struggled to my feet and went along with them . <p> From cafes on both sides of the wide boulevard armed men were striding purposefully toward their leader . He marched straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither to the right nor left . They formed up behind him , some two or three dozen men . <p> Breathlessly , I followed along . <p> " To the Elysee ! " shouted the tall one , striding determinedly on his long legs , never glancing back to see if the others were following him . <p> Then I saw my wife pushing through the curious onlookers thronging the sidewalks . I called to her and she ran to me , blonde and slim and more lovely than anyone in all of spacetime . <p> " What is it ? " she asked , as breathless as I. " What 's happening ? " <p> " Some sort of coup , I think . " <p> " They have guns ! " " Yes . " <p> " We should get inside . If there 's shooting  --  " <p> " No , we 'll be all right , " I said . " I want to see what 's going to happen . " <p> It was a coup , all right . But it failed miserably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaulle , believed that his little band of followers could capture the government . He depended on a certain General Petain , who had the prestige and authority that de Gaulle himself lacked . <p> Petain lost his nerve at the critical moment , however , and abandoned the coup . The police and a detachment of army troops were waiting for the rebels at the Petit Palace ; a few shots were exchanged . Before the smoke had drifted away the rebels had scattered and de Gaulle himself was taken into custody . <p> " He will be charged with treason , I imagine , " I said to my darling wife as we sat that evening at the very same sidewalk cafe . The very same table , in fact . <p> " I doubt that they 'll give him more than a slap on the wrist , " she said . " He seems to be a hero to everyone in Paris . " <p> " Not to the Germans , " I said . <p> She smiled at me . " The Germans take him as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their shouted conversations quite easily . <p> " He is no joke . " <p> We both turned to the dark little man sitting at the next table ; we were packed in so close that his chair almost touched mine . He was a particularly ugly man , with lank black hair and the swarthy face of a born conspirator . His eyes were small , reptilian , and his upper lip was twisted by a curving scar . <p> " Charles de Gaulle will be the savior of France , " he said . He was absolutely serious . Grim , even . <p> " If he 's not guillotined for treason , " I replied lightly . Yet inwardly I began to tremble . <p> " You were here . You saw how he rallied the men of France . " <p> " All two dozen of them , " I quipped . <p> He looked at me with angry eyes . " Next time it will be different . We will not rely on cowards and turncoats like Petain . Next time we will take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then ... " <p> He hesitated , glancing around as if the police might be listening . <p> " Then ? " my wife coaxed . <p> He lowered his voice . " Then revenge on Germany and all the those who betrayed us . " <p> " You ca n't be serious . " <p> " You 'll see . Next time we will win . Next time we will have all of France with us . And then all of Europe . And then , the world . " <p> My jaw must have dropped . It was all going to happen anyway . The French would re-arm . Led by a ruthless , fanatical de Gaulle , they would plunge Europe into a second world war . All my efforts were for nothing . The world that we had left would continue to exist  --  or be even worse . <p> He turned his reptilian eyes to my lovely wife . Although many of the German women were blonde , she was far more beautiful than any of them . <p> " You are Aryan ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonplussed . " Aryan ? I do n't understand . " <p> " Yes you do , " he said , almost hissing the words . " Next time it will go hard on the Aryans . You 'll see . " <p> I sank my head in my hands and wept openly . <p> <p> <p> By Ben Bova <p>
