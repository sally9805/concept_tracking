HELL HATH NO FURY <P> Is n't it a sad commentary on today 's world that a movie like The First Wives Club , with revenge as the central theme , is so popular Society , Oct. 7 ? The notion that revenge must always be obtained against anyone you now consider your " enemy " contributes to the thinking patterns that are responsible for so many troubled and failing marriages . Hollywood continues to do its part to subvert American society while laughing all the way to the bank . M. KENT MILLER Lexington , North Carolina Via E-mail <P> I am a divorced woman in her mid-50s , and I disagree with the sweet-revenge focus of your story . My motive for going to ( and thoroughly enjoying ) The First Wives Club was to see these three fiftyish women who are talented , sexy and successful . Diane Keaton , Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn are inspiring examples of life after menopause . They illustrate the fact that mature women need not feel invisible but are still vital and appealing .

It describes a very small minority of divorces . Here are some of the myths contrasted with what recent studies in fact tell us : <P> Myth No. 1 : Most men cheat on their wives .

Most divorced women do not regret it . Moreover , divorced women are generally happier than divorced men , and divorced women are better off emotionally too . <P> One aspect of the film is accurate : women in general are financially worse off than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some studies indicate that this difference washes out after five years . ORLI PETER , Director Marriage , Family and Child Counseling Program Mount St. Mary 's College Los Angeles <P> Why should first wives want revenge ? They can end up with the home , the kids and a big slice of their ex-husband 's future earnings . That type of alimony makes marriage the only job in the world that one can quit but still get paid for while providing no service whatever . Alimony is a holdover from those unequal times when single women had few employment options and little status . Now there is plenty of equality , status and jobs . Divorced women should shoulder their load like the men , get on with their independent lives and turn a bit of that anger inward . After all , it takes two to mess up a relationship . RICHARD P.
