<p> WASHINGTON  --  An impetuous former governor battles a proud , stubborn senator for a diplomatic post south of the border , and a mild-mannered Hoosier with a grudge seizes a key supporting role . It may not be Hamlet , but as political theater it 's four-star . <p> The drama over William Weld 's nomination to be ambassador to Mexico simmered all summer with offstage sniping and posturing . The action moves onstage Friday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee meeting that could decide Weld 's fate even as it underscores raw conflict in the Republican Party . <p> The impassable roadblock in Weld 's path is committee Chairman Jesse Helms , who has refused to hold a hearing on the nomination . Weld sympathizers forced Friday 's meeting , but it 's unlikely they can force a discussion of Weld . <p> " The Weld nomination will not be on the agenda , " Helms said in a letter to those who petitioned for the meeting . He said he has sole authority to set that agenda , and he 'll have a parliamentarian on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were collecting signatures Wednesday on a letter urging Helms to set aside parliamentary procedure in favor of " courtesy , goodwill and tolerance of divergent opinions . " It was their only hope ; at least for now , Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott , R-Miss. , has said he wo n't overrule Helms . <p> What are these people fighting about ? And who are they anyway ? With the curtain about to rise , meet the cast : <p>  --  Republican Weld , 51 , former governor of Massachusetts , a carrot-haired , 6-foot-4 fiscal conservative who supports gay rights and legal abortion . Bored with being governor , he resigned in July to try to rescue his troubled nomination . He may have his eye on a bigger prize : the White House . <p>  --  Helms , 75 , an irascible North Carolina Republican who opposes abortion , gay rights , much international cooperation and diplomatic nominees whom he deems unfit . He has said there would be no hearing , the usual path to Senate confirmation , on the Mexico post until President Clinton finds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lugar , the No. 2 Republican on the committee , driven to confront the man wielding the chairman 's gavel that he believes should be his . Lugar , 65 , may have reaped more publicity by taking on Helms than he did during a brief 1996 presidential campaign . " That is an irony , " he concedes . <p>  --  Clinton , the Democrat who started the Republican ruckus by nominating Weld in the first place . He might have expected the GOP-controlled Senate to rally around one of its own . The resulting uproar appeared to catch the White House off-guard . <p> Clinton says he has a " surprisingly constructive " relationship with Helms and would rather not disrupt it . Weld has made it clear he wants the job and Clinton 's full backing . Clinton , lukewarm from the start , may run out of feasible options after Friday . <p> From Clinton 's standpoint , Weld was a logical choice . He speaks Spanish , he has a law enforcement background ( he was U.S. attorney in Massachusetts and an assistant attorney general in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity Clinton says he wants . <p> Weld was a highly successful governor in the eyes of Republicans , a model tax-cutter who contracted out many state services to the private sector . But he has turned into their nightmare nominee . His libertarian social views and Helms ' Christian-conservative outlook illuminate the party 's philosophical chasm at its deepest . <p> Helms has myriad objections to Weld , from " loose lips " to lack of " ambassadorial quality . " But the shorthand description of his opposition evolved quickly to " soft on drugs . " Weld favors needle exchange programs for drug addicts to prevent the spread of AIDS , and he backs the legal use of marijuana by cancer patients to ease nausea brought on by chemotherapy . <p> The Helms view : Given the illicit drugs flooding across the border from Mexico , this is the wrong post for Weld . Would n't he like India instead ? The Weld view : Forget it . <p> The deadlock moved Time magazine to compare the resumes of Weld and John Gavin , a Reagan-era ambassador to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were decades of legal and political experience ; for Gavin , the main entry was " actor in feature films , 1956-81 . " <p> To Lugar , the issue is not Weld 's qualifications but Helms ' behavior as chairman . Colleagues for a generation on the agriculture and foreign relations committees , the two have had strained relations since 1986 . <p> That 's when Helms , who had pledged to protect his farmers ' interests as top Republican on the agriculture panel , decided to trade that for the top spot on foreign relations . The less senior Lugar was pushed aside despite support for him among committee Republicans . " Senator Helms decided perhaps that he had protected people long enough , " Lugar says pointedly . <p> Tensions boil over <p> With Lugar advocating a strong U.S. presence on the world stage , the two men are usually at odds . Helms , for example , led Republican opposition to the chemical weapons treaty approved this year while Lugar led Republicans who favored it . Tensions peaked this summer when Helms did not name Lugar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department . <p> Still , political observers were stunned when Lugar publicly rebuked Helms . Indianans , says Lugar , " want me to go head to head " with a man they consider " a bully . " When the agriculture committee weighs the tobacco-lawsuit settlement , of great interest to Helms and his constituents , Lugar said in an interview , " I am very likely to exclude him from participation and take steps just as arbitrary as the ones he is taking . " <p> Bit players in the melodrama include Sen. Joseph Biden , D-Del. , the senior Democrat on foreign relations , in a mediator role ; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who has an old-fashioned , almost familial relationship with the courtly Helms ; and Neil Newhouse , the Republican strategist who polls for Helms and Weld . ( The only thing he 'll say : " Both of these men have won a tremendous amount of respect from voters in their home states . " ) <p> Conservatives depict Helms as a champion under siege , in danger of getting " steamrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces " are in fact less cohesive and committed than the true-blue conservatives in Helms ' corner . Weld 's allies include the administration , most Democrats , GOP moderates , fellow governors and senators who simply say he deserves a hearing . <p> Speculation about Weld 's motives is rampant . There is one sure thing : He wanted out of his old job . By 1993 , the third year of his first term , he already was saying two terms as governor would be enough . He won re-election by a 71%-28% landslide in 1994 and within two years was aiming for the Senate . He lost the 1994 race to Democrat John Kerry , made clear he was interested in an administration post and jumped at the Mexico offer . <p> Is Weld 's eye on 2000 ? <p> As a rule , nominees take great pains to be deferential to those controlling their destiny . And they are supposed to stay very quiet until their confirmation hearings . <p> Weld is re-emerging this month on Capitol Hill and on TV after a silent summer . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperate compared with the provocative statements he made during a two-month period between word that he would be nominated and his actual nomination . <p> What was he thinking ? Was he trying to catapult into the public imagination as a different kind of Republican , in preparation for a 2000 presidential bid ? Some say that 's the only way to explain why he accused Helms of " ideological extortion " and painted himself as a martyr for the cause of an open , inclusive GOP . <p> " Bill Weld has sounded a lot like Joan of Arc lately , " conservative writer Tucker Carlson observed in The Weekly Standard , the magazine of record when it comes to internecine Republican warfare . <p> Helms , for his part , has sounded like himself . During a 24-year Senate career he has made it clear he would rather fight than compromise . In an institution that gives individuals the tools to block just about anything , he has annoyed countless colleagues by gumming up their causes or nominees . <p> Helmut Sonnenfeldt , a foreign policy expert at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long he has followed Helms ' career : " Ever since he put a hold on my nomination in 1973 . " As he recalls , Helms considered him too willing to deal with the Soviets . But after a few weeks , Helms relented and Sonnenfeldt became a State Department counselor . <p> A hero to the conservative movement , Helms has fought money for AIDS groups , filibustered against the Martin Luther King Jr . holiday and led the charge against the National Endowment for the Arts because of grants for projects he considers pornographic . <p> His last two election campaigns were both against African-American architect Harvey Gantt . Helms ' ads appealed to white voters ' fears of losing out on jobs because of racial quotas and depicted Gantt as a supporter of gay marriage , which Gantt denied . <p> Helms ' manner has mellowed since he became chairman in 1995 . But his positions , for the most part , have not changed . He and Weld are " outriders " pushing opposite edges of their party , says political scientist Thad Beyle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal conflict the Republican Party will face when it chooses a presidential nominee in 2000 . " In the end , Helms probably will prevail " on Weld , says Ross Baker , a political scientist at Rutgers University . " But the last word will not have been spoken .
