Are we not all dreamy or daft enough to think of ourselves as superheroes in the comic book of our lives ? Are we not tickled to think that the world is somehow dependent on our skills and charisma ? And do we not come to understand , in the bleak clarity of reality , that some heroes  --  especially the one staring at us in the bathroom mirror  --  will never be truly super ? <P> It was the inspiration of comic-book artiste Bob Burden to answer these ornate rhetorical questions . He created , in his Mystery Men stories , " a bizarre hodge-podge crew of second string , blue collar , milltown heroes . " Now Burden 's words are made flesh in a movie version that , for all its fights and stuff blowing up , dares to deflect action-adventure expectations to pursue off-kilter character comedy . <P> Each of our heroes has a tiny , not very useful skill . Mr. Furious ( Ben Stiller ) works himself into a fine rage . The Blue Rajah ( Hank Azaria ) flings silverware . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " I shovel well . I shovel very well . " While glitzy Captain Amazing ( Greg Kinnear ) routinely saves Champion City with his bravado and big ego , the Mystery Men must scrounge to find the perils they believe they were born to overcome . <P> Neil Cuthbert 's clever screenplay is a parable of class . The three main Mystery Men may not be much , but when they audition other heroes in preparation for battle against evil genius Casanova Frankenstein ( Geoffrey Rush ) , they discover there are nicely delineated levels of mediocrity . The Waffler , with his magic Truth Syrup , White Flight and the Black Menace ( " We work together " )  --  all are unworthy of joining even this pickup team . But there is talent out there . The Bowler ( Janeane Garofalo ) has a magic ball with her father 's head inside ; Dad nags her from beyond the grave . Spleen ( Paul Reubens ) unleashes fart darts , silent but deadly . The Sphinx ( Wes Studi ) has a profoundly inane aphorism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) may one day live up to his name . In unity these losers find strength and cool . The unholy three become the Seven Glamourai . <P> What 's cool about Mystery Men is that it is what it 's about . Expected to underachieve in a season of teen-boy farces , it triumphs by being its smart , shambling self , though it takes a while to get there . In the opening scene , director Kinka Usher tries to get a Tim Burton flavor of dark comic hipness and blows it ; he is flailing even as Mr. Furious does at first . Usher feels his way to the right tempo and tone , and when he finds it he does n't let go . <P> He gets seamless ensemble work from the year 's most agreeable , most cannily chosen cast . These , after all , are not-quite stars playing not-quite supermen . They grow in the roles as they grow comfortable in them . By the end they have cobbled together an A-minus comedy about B-plus people . Every other action picture is about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely heroic Us . It 's about making the best of your small talents  --  about looking in the mirror and , despite all evidence to the contrary , smiling back . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
