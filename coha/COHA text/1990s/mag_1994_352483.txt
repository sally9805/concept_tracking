The Sony Corporation of America did Hollywood better than Hollywood . In the company 's postmodern Manhattan headquarters , designed for AT &T; by architect Philip Johnson , the sushi bar in a private corporate dining room had a tiny stream running through its marble counter . The $100 million makeover of Sony 's Culver City studio lot included pillars adorned with elaborate murals . A fleet of corporate jets sat in the hangar , and fresh cut flowers were delivered daily to executives . The corporate culture seemed to say that to pamper is to prosper . <P> Sony invested $5 billion to buy Columbia and TriStar Pictures back in 1989 , propelled by a romantic notion that constructors of compact discs and , television sets could marry makers of music and movies . Last week Sony sobered up . The firm took a $2.7 billion write-off  --  one of the steepest in Hollywood history  --  on its money-losing film studio and reported a second-quarter loss of $3.2 billion . " If we did n't do it once and for all now , we would continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hashimoto , Sony 's executive deputy president . That was the practical assessment . Hollywood 's goes something like this : " It is a Japanese failure of judgment and an American failure of management , " says a major Sony investor . <P> But while Sony 's disaster drew the harshest verdicts , other Japanese giants have been proving recently that their American investments have suffered from bad oversight , bad calls and bad timing . Last week Mitsubishi , which has an 80% stake in the Rockefeller Group , owner of New York 's Rockefeller Center , threatened to default on its $1.3 billion mortgage , taken out five years ago when borrowing was easy . Matsushita , meanwhile , is locked in a struggle with the American executives who run MCA  --  the film studio it bought for $6.1 billion in 1990  --  over the Americans ' demand for more authority and investment capital . Last week the company reportedly hired Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz and media dealmaker Herbert Allen to help make peace and to " re-evaluate " MCA 's assets ; one option would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American counterparts , Japanese executives cheerfully overpaid for their late- ' 80s acquisitions . But the Japanese made another fundamental miscalculation , says Gary Saxonhouse , an economics professor at the University of Michigan : " They had a faith in American landmarks , a faith in American blue-chip names . " <P> Sony 's Hollywood foray began , as so many sour business deals do , with bold rhetoric and grand strategies . Norio Ohga , the part-time symphony orchestra conductor who has been Sony 's CEO since 1989 , believed in a " synergy " between Sony 's core business , producing " hardware " such as VCRS and camcorders , and Hollywood 's " software "  --  movies . Owning a studio , Sony thought , would help give the company the clout to set the industry standard for the next generation of digital video technology . In the early 1980s Sony 's Betamax format of analog videotapes lost out to VHS , so Sony was determined not be left behind again . But Sony 's strategy turned out to be a mistake when the industry agreed last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolize.
