Warm summer nights offer an amazing array of deep-sky objects to explore with a telescope . Bright globular clusters like M5 and M13 lie high in the sky , and the great star clouds that delineate the Milky Way rise in the east . Star clusters and nebulae , missing from the spring skies , come into view . Nearly all types of deep-sky objects scatter across the heavens during these balmy nights . With the apparent exception of galaxies . Galaxies do float about the summer sky , but most are blocked by the thick clouds of stars and dust in the Milky Way Galaxy . One of the greatest clumps of bright galaxies we are able to see this time of year is the beautiful collection of spirals and ellipticals in Draco . Although Draco appears to the naked eye as a rather dim star group winding around the pole , it presents a vast domain rich in memorable galaxies to the telescope user armed with a star atlas . The largest galaxy in Draco is NGC 4236 , a huge , loose spiral located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the stars Kappa and Lambda Draconis . To find NGC 4236 , locate Kappa and sweep about 1.5deg west and then shift about 15 ' south . Use low power first to see the dim glow ; then switch to medium power to examine surface details . A large , outlying member of the M81/M82 group of galaxies , NGC 4236 is also a close neighbor to our own small group of galaxies . The M81 group , only 7.5 million light-years distant , also includes NGC 2403 and NGC 2366 . Photographs show NGC 4236 as a large , loose spiral with fragmented arms containing knotty clumps of stars and gas . NGC 4236 glows at magnitude 9.6 but has a low surface brightness because its light spreads over 18.6 ' by 6.9 ' ' . Visually , this object reminds me of the large , dim giants of the Sculptor group of galaxies . In a 10-inch scope , I see a very large , dim glow oriented nearly north-south with a low contrast , barlike center . In large backyard scopes you may see some low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , locate the star Iota Draconis near the Bootes-Draco border . Here you 'll find two small clusters of bright galaxies whose members are among some of Draco 's best known deep-sky objects . M102 ( NGC 5866 ) , a spindle-shaped galaxy bright enough to see in binoculars , is part of a small cluster of galaxies about 35 million light-years distant . M102 lies about 3.5deg southwest of Iota Draconis , glows at 10th magnitude , and measures 5.2 ' by 2.3 ' ' . Start your star-hop to this galaxy from a 5th-magnitude star on the Bootes-Draco border . M102 lies a mere 1.3deg north of this star . Considerable controversy surrounds NGC 5866 , as some astronomers consider it one of the " lost " Messier objects . In the mid-19th century William H. Smyth suggested that NGC 5866 was originally logged by Messier 's assistant Pierre Mechain as M102 . Later in this century , this assumption proved wrong . Instead , when Mechain observed a 102nd object in the catalog , he was actually viewing M101 , a large spiral in Ursa Major that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cataloguers and writers have called this galaxy M102 for decades . Unlike most galaxies viewed through a telescope , M102 resembles its appearance in photographs . Photographs reveal an elongated elliptical or lenticular ( type S0 ) galaxy with a thin equatorial dust lane . M102 's lens shape , typical of S0 galaxies , is visible in small backyard scopes . With a 4-inch scope , you 'll notice the galaxy 's spindle shape and sharply pointed ends . M102 's high surface brightness allows for use of greater magnifications than you normally use when viewing galaxies . Observers with dark skies and scopes larger than 12.5 inches in aperture may see the narrow dust lane that bisects M102 lengthwise . With a 20-inch scope at 175x , I saw a beautiful spindle shape with a razor-sharp dust lane . The most impressive galaxy in the group of galaxies surrounding M102 ? NGC 5907 . This huge dusty spiral spans over 12 ' ' , nearly half the size of the Moon . Lying about 2deg east-northeast of M102 , it offers unusual detail and is reasonably bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small scope reveals a long dusty streak with a small bright core . A large backyard scope  --  16 inches or more  --  reveals this galaxy in all its splendor . When I first viewed it with a 20-inch scope , I saw a bright , highly elongated object of even thickness and a central hub with a slight bulge . An irregular dust lane cuts across the galaxy , giving it a mottled appearance . NGC 5905 and NGC 5908 might belong to the same galaxy group . NGC 5905 is a small , face-on barred spiral , while the other galaxy is a tilted spiral . Both have much higher recessional velocities than the other galaxies in the area and probably do not belong to the group , but constitute a background pair . NGC 5905 lies about 50 ' south of NGC 5907 and appears as a modest , 12.3-magnitude smudge elongated northwest-southeast . The rather bright central bar contains a small dense core . The galaxy 's face-on orientation provides a good contrast to the large edge-on systems that make up the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5905 , about 12 ' to the southeast . Its higher surface brightness disk appears distinctly elongated . Observers with modest backyard scopes should have no problem picking out this distant double system under relatively dark skies . Another small group of galaxies can be found nearly 2deg east of Iota Draconis . Although close neighbors in the sky to the M102/NGC 5907 group , galaxies NGC 5981 , NGC 5982 , and NGC 5985 lie in the distant background relative to the M102 group . This tiny trio spans less than 20 ' ' , so all three members fit in the field of a medium power eyepiece . Take note of their various orientations and shapes as you observe them . The most impressive member , NGC 5985 , displays fine , tightly wound arms . At magnitude 11.0 , it outshines several of the better known Virgo galaxies . Smaller telescopes will have little difficulty showing a bright oval nebulous patch oriented north-south . The small bright core readily stands out from the surrounding halo . In large backyard scopes , this galaxy has a mottled texture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle member , NGC 5982 , is a small elliptical galaxy . The galaxy 's appearance , typical of ellipticals , is aperture independent . In other words , the galaxy appears about the same in small and large telescopes . Small and relatively bright , this galaxy is an easy target even in suburban skies . You should be able to see a small , slightly oval object with a very bright round core . The westernmost member , NGC 5981 , is a delicate edge-on Sc spiral galaxy . At only 13.0 magnitude , its wispy streak of nebulosity surrounds a tiny stellar core . This silvery needle is 2.8 ' long but only 0.6 ' wide , making an interesting contrast to the more face-on spiral , NGC 5985 . Several other faint members of this group are visible in this region . These faint galaxies require large backyard scopes to be seen . Our last galaxy , NGC 6503 , can be found in a line between the bright stars Psi and Omega Draconis . I find it easiest to start from Omega and star-hop north to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' north and sweep to the east about 1.3deg until you see a nebulous patch of light . Old references classify this galaxy as an Sc spiral , but photographs show tightly wound arms with a prominent central hub . Hence , the galaxy has been reclassified as an Sa spiral . With a magnitude of 10.2 , NGC 6503 is brighter than many of the more famous Messier galaxies . Observing NGC 6503 with a medium-sized backyard scope shows a bright oval region elongated about 3:1 with an indistinct nucleus . With a large scope the galaxy 's outer envelope appears mottled . Draco is a hidden wonderland . Although it appears drab to the naked eye , the constellation offers a rare selection of bright galaxies for small telescope observers .
