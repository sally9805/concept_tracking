ALL SYSTEMS GO // y first tour nearly ended in disaster . It was the summer of 1969 . I 'd pedaled up a pass in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and was on my way back down when both brake cables snapped . Luckily , there were no cars coming when I sped across the intersection at the mountain 's base . Even luckier , the rotten fence I crashed through was n't barbed wire . And luckier still , the field I landed in was n't home to a bull . Ahhh , youth . Had I inspected my Peugeot 10-speed before departing , I would have found the glitch and had a safe tour . Do n't repeat my mistake . Here are the key things to check on your mountain or road bike to ensure your next big ride goes safely . SEATPOST AND SEAT A bent post may break . Check by sighting from the side . A line that bisects the seat tube should also bisect the seatpost . If not , remove the post and inspect it ( photo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clamp . Both are signs of impending doom . Replace the post if it 's bent or damaged . Also check the seat rails beneath the seat for bends because they may break if damaged . TIRES Worn tires can blow . Check the tread for bald spots or worse , signs that the rubber has worn through to the casing . Also inspect the sidewalls , which should be flexible . If the tread is worn or the sidewalls are cracking or even appear dry and fragile ( photo ) , replace the tire . Periodically inspect your tires for slits or embedded glass that could lead to a blowout . RIM CRACKS Cracks in rims can lead to wheel collapse . Check rims carefully , particularly around the spoke nipple holes ( photo ) . These cracks can lead to rapid loss of tension and possibly wheel collapse . If you find cracks , replace the rim . CRANKARMS Scratches and grooves can lead to breakage . Check the inside face of the right crankarm-if the front derailleur is out of adjustment it can graze the arm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for cracks where the spider joins the arms and where the pedal threads in . Finally , remove the crankarm bolt and closely inspect around the crankarm hole for cracks . If you find any , replace the arm . FRAME Cracks , chips and ripples in the frame are all signs of damage . The best time to inspect the frame is after you 've cleaned it . Look for ripples and paint chips in the tube intersections and dropoutsthese are signs of damage that could lead to a loss of control at speed or outright frame failure . Also , closely inspect the dropouts and tube junctures for cracks ( photo ) that could lead to failures . If the frame is damaged , have it assessed by a professional mechanic as soon as possible . Steel frames can be repaired ; some other types ca n't . HANDLEBAR If the bar breaks you 're in for a bad fall , so inspect it regularly . Look for scoring near the stem ( photo ) that can lead to breakage . A bent bar should also be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angled evenly on both sides . FORK A cracked fork can fail . Clean the fork , then check the dropouts ( photo ) and tube junctions for cracks . To be doubly safe , remove the fork and inspect the steerer ( the part inside the frame ) . Also , on suspension forks , scrutinize the brake arch for cracks where it joins the brake posts . Replace the bad parts if possible . ff not , replace the fork . RIM WEAR Cracked or grooved rims can lead to blown tires or wheel failure . On mountain bikes this is often caused by the brake pads wearing through to the metal and rubbing on the rim sidewalls . Check your pads for wear and your rims for developing grooves ( photo . If a groove is 1/16-inch deep or more , replace the rim . Keeping the pads free of grit will prevent rapid rim wear . CABLES Fraying and rust are two signs that cables will fail . Replace them immediately . Cable problems usually occur inside the levers ( squeeze brake levers and look inside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables pass over a guide such as on the bottom bracket ( photo ) .
