When the worst drought anybody could remember stretched on and on , things got tough in the swamp . Especially for Georgie . Georgie had not liked the swamp in the best of weather ; it was too wet , too dank , too eerie . He much preferred Lexington Avenue and 88th Street , New York City , where he had spent his happiest hours , even though dear old Mother Nature officially decreed that alligators were never happy outside a swamp . <p> Georgie had finally given up arguing the point that dear old Mother Nature had rocks in her head . <p> " So I 'm happy , " he used to say gloomily , lying on a mudbank surrounded by mangroves and moccasins and such . " It 's right there in the book . " <p> He said this to himself , as he said most things . Georgie was not popular in the swamp ; in fact , the other members of the colony that inhabited this stretch of muck and quicksand , black water and scum , had banished him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first arrived they had been wary enough ; after Georgie had sounded off they had labeled him a radical , at best , and more probably a pathological liar . <p> " Morons , " Georgie would sniff . " Yokels . " <p> But he was lonesome . Even if Alice had not treated him as she had he would have been miserable as an outcast , because Georgie was basically a gregarious kid who needed friendly company , a bunch of the boys with whom to whoop it up occasionally . With a congenial crowd of fellow ' gators he might have adapted himself to a humanless existence ; as it was , he grew more nostalgic , more morose , day by day . <p> He had thought of beating his way back to New York , but his worst spells of homesickness had not given him the courage to make another try . His first four attempts had turned out badly and , besides , he realized that humans who did n't know him were likely to take a dim view of traveling alligators . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down , for instance . He had positively flipped his lid the time Georgie had unlocked the door of his room and had taken a little stroll to stretch his legs in the cool of the evening . The jughead had waved a shotgun around and if Mr. and Mrs. Jones and Nancy and Susie had n't all yelled bloody murder there was no telling what would have happened . <p> There was the Lincoln Tunnel too ; he had no idea how he could get through that with a whole hide , even if he lucked onto the right way home instead of getting lost again . <p> " So here you squat , " he muttered , " in the middle of a Florida mudhole . Very gay , that 's you . If I could just once latch onto that rental agent  --  " <p> Life had been so good before the rental agent had walked into the Jones apartment and spotted him lying on the window ledge , looking down at the traffic on Lexington Avenue , minding his own business . You 'd think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hollered and waved his arms and gotten blue in the face . <p> " That 's Georgie , " Mrs. Jones had tried to explain . " He 's our pet ! " <p> " Get him outta here ! " was all the rental agent had been able to screech . <p> " But we 've had Georgie ever since he was a tiny baby , " Mrs. Jones had said . " We brought him up from Florida as a souvenir for Susie when she was 3 years old . " <p> " Susie is 14 now if she 's a day , " the man had gasped . " You mean that thing is  --  " <p> " They grow about a foot a year , " Mrs. Jones had said , and very patiently too . " That explains Georgie 's size .

" Georgie thinks moving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquisitive jerk , but it had developed that this guy had some kind of phobia about alligators in apartment houses . And Mr. Jones had finally gone over to the opposition and said something about maybe their knowing at the office that he kept a pet alligator was why he had n't been made a member of the firm , and it had all wound up with them deciding to give him to a zoo . <p> Georgie knew now that it would n't have been too bad , compared with what had happened to him , but at the time he had put up a beef . He had hissed and spread his paws and tried to tell them that this was a lousy way to treat a member of the family , and after a real go-around he had won and the zoo idea was out . But what had they come up with next ? <p> Nancy ( he suspected Nancy had n't liked him much since the time he came out of the kitchen to get a gander at her special new boyfriend and the pantywaist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was about all dear old Mother Nature 's children that were in captivity . Turn Georgie back to his native habitat , Nancy had emoted , where he would be as happy as dear old M.N. intended . <p> They had sold him a bill of goods , the four of them . They had convinced him that there was something to this return-of-the-native bit and he actually had enjoyed the trip down Route 301 , thinking how nice it would be to have a lot of friends of his own kind and  --  heh !  --  a girlfriend or two . <p> The parting had been pretty teary on both sides , but if Georgie had known what was waiting for him in the swamp there would n't have been any parting at all ; he would have stuck with them if it had meant making a scene right there in the middle of the highway . He had watched them drive away , all weeping , and then he had turned and headed into the swamp and the friends and the little gal ' gator who were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things had not been so good . In the first place , the swamp water was not the water of the Jones shower ; in the second place , a body could n't move an inch without getting all over black mud . The bugs were something terrible and the heat was terrific . <p> But if he had been sweating up a storm when he walked into the kaffee klatsch Big Abe was presiding over , the freeze had hit him immediately . They had all stopped talking and given him the fish eye , no matter how wide the grin he had given them . There had been an eight-bar pause before Big Abe , the head man , had asked , " Something ? " <p> Georgie had been burned by his reception and perhaps his first crack had been a little flip for a newcomer . " Yeah , Cuddles , " he had said , " I 'm looking for a place in the country , and your village was recommended . " <p> " The next colony , " Abe had said , barely moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't miss it . " <p> Georgie had started to move along and then he had spied Alice . She was gorgeous ; Georgie fell for her on sight . He fell so hard , in fact , that he changed his tune to Big Abe ; he practically begged to be permitted to stay . <p> " Well , all right , " Abe had said . " You can stay if you behave yourself . We got no use for troublemakers in this here swamp . " <p> Georgie had said sure , sure , they would n't have any trouble with him ; but there had been nothing but trouble from the word go . Alice had no use for him , laughed at his New Yorkese , would n't date him no matter how he pleaded , went out of her way to be nasty . And  --  well , maybe it was Georgie 's fault that he made no friends with his suggestions for changes , such as tidying up the swamp a little here and there and livening up the menu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint about the food . <p> " Fish , nothing but fish , " he had grumbled . " Do n't you guys ever get sick of this lox on the fin ? Now in New York  --  " <p> " Listen , you ! " Big Abe had roared . " If you do n't like the food here why do n't you go back where you came from ? We 're getting fed up with your griping , Buster ! " <p> " I only said  --  " <p> " You been only saying ever since you hit here ! " Abe had made horrid mimicry of Georgie 's accent . " In N'Yawk I had steak bones and leftover broccoli . In N'Yawk I never went to bed before midnight . In N'Yawk this and in N'Yawk that  --  I tell you it 's getting on our nerves ! " <p> " Nerves ? " Georgie had retorted , stung . " What nerves have you dopes developed , sloshing around in this cesspool ? In N'Yawk  --  I mean New York  --  we got nerves that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a fearful row that had ended with Georgie being tossed out of the colony , bodily . <p> That was the first time Georgie had sworn he was going to try to make it back to New York and who cared if a trailer truck got him somewhere in Maryland ? He had started out , full of embittered vim and vigor , and he had journeyed five days and six nights before he wound up bumping into Big Abe in the dark and taking another shellacking . He had traveled in a circle . Three more attempts to get out had all ended the same way . Georgie was lost  --  lost in his own adopted backyard . <p> The others had jeered , Alice most of all . " All that stuff ' bout goin ' Nawth , " she had drawled . " Ah bet ( she pronounced it bay-utt ) that old Gawgie jus ' simply died ( dahd ) he was so skay-udd , soon as he got one measly ole mile . " <p> The interpretation is not exaggerated ; she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gal , that Alice  --  so much so that her neighbors usually snickered , shuddered , or gagged whenever she opened her mouth . Georgie thought her talk was cute . <p> Alice 's ridicule had proved the final straw ; Georgie , crushed , had retreated to his mudbank on the outskirts , and there he basked drearily while the drought lengthened and the situation reached a crisis . <p> To Georgie , it was awful . The swamp , to him , had never been the fragrant Eden it was to the other ' gators ; a million times more savory to him the perfume of auto exhausts , the tangy scent of subway ventilators , than the exotic blend of subtropical flowers and still , shadowy pools . Now , with the swamp drying up , the water receding to leave long stretches of gas-bubbled muck , the air became decidedly ripe . <p> " This , " Georgie murmured , but dispiritedly , " is something for the board of health . I 'm probably loading myself with virus bugs every breath I take . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares ? " <p> Brooding dismally , he passed the days waiting for the virus to carry him off , dreaming of the dear , dead days of 88th and Lex , shunning the others and being shunned . <p> Then one morning  --  there was a rustling in the drought-seared foliage , the sound of sobbing , and Alice came into view . <p> " Gawgie ! Gawgie , honey ! " she cried . " They left me behind ! They deserted me ! " She avalanched upon the stunned Georgie and cast herself into his arms , weeping brokenly . " The old meanies , " she wailed . " They snuck out on me , Gawgie ! What 'll Ah do ? " <p> " You mean the others have gone someplace ? " Georgie asked brilliantly . <p> She disentangled herself to wave her arms . " Gone someplace ? But of co'se they 've gone someplace ! They 've migrated , that 's what ! And they promised to take little ole me along if Ah  --  if Ah talked different , but Ah sho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way Ah was bo'n to talk ! Ah tole them Ah 'd try to talk the way they-all wanted me to , but Ah kai n't change overnight , kin Ah ? Ah sweah , Ah think they 're downraat mean to sneak out on me when they migrated  --  " <p> " Just a minute , Alice , " Georgie broke in dazedly . " What 's with this migrating ? " <p> " The drought , silly ! " she explained patiently . " They been fixin ' to migrate foh days and days . And they promised to take me if Ah changed the way Ah talk  --  that big ole Abe said Ah got on his nerves  --  and Ah tried , and what 'd they do ? They up and left me with jus ' you , that 's what ; and what 'll I do ? " <p> It took a bit of deciphering , but Georgie finally got the story . It seemed that the touchy nerves Big Abe boasted had been twanged once too often by Alice 's Southern accent ; the boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quote the tearful Alice ) " talked through mah nose lak a Yaankee , " she would suffer Georgie 's fate , ostracism . <p> " And when we-all were fixin ' to migrate , Ah  --  Ah guess Ah got so excited Ah forgot ; and  --  and they snuck out on me , " Alice said , collapsing again into sobs . <p> If Georgie had been less in love he might have been reminded that this was the gal who had been loudest in urging his banishment and he might have thought that grim justice had been done . But Georgie was in love . <p> " Do n't you worry , " he said stoutly . " Let the others whatchacallit  --  migrate ; the two of us can get along all right . " <p> " But we kai n't stay here ! " Alice cried . " What would Ah eat ? " <p> Georgie looked about him and saw to his surprise that while he had been waiting for the virus to finish him off , the pools where the detested fish dwelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots and herbs . " <p> She gave him a lip-curled look . " Ah might have known you would n't be a gentleman , " she said . " Jus ' settin ' there laughin ' at me , and Ah 'm about to stahve . " She turned away , nose held high . <p> " Hold on ! " Georgie cried . " I 'll find the others for you , if that 's what you want . They ca n't be far away , if they only left last night . " <p> Her eyes widened . " Oh , Gawgie , " she breathed . " Do you really think you could ? " <p> " Simple , " Georgie said . " All we got to do is find the place they left from and follow the scent . Stands to reason that mob left some kind of a scent . " He added silently , " The understatement of the week . " <p> Alice cast herself into Georgie 's arms again . " Mah hero ! " she actually cried . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accolade , but more probably it was that the overpowering general smell of the drought-ridden swamp made picking up any single scent impossible ; in any case , Georgie sniffed himself blue in the face without getting a trace of anything reminiscent of Big Abe or the others . Alice watched him snuffle around , and the curl came back to her lip . <p> " You kai n't pick up the scent , kin you ? " she sneered . <p> " Who , me ? " Georgie asked , astounded . " Of course I can . Matter of fact , I have . They went  --  thataway . " <p> So saying , he plunged recklessly into the dehydrated morass . He struck out in the direction he would have taken if he had been Big Abe , leading a migration of 60-odd alligators . Alice may have hesitated momentarily , but she followed . <p> Georgie , of course , guessed wrong . With four main points of the compass and innumerable degrees of those points to choose from , he selected the worst possible direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those happy days at 88th and Lex ; it could also have been due to the fact that Georgie was a noodnick when it came to the simplest outdoor pursuit . He was an apartment-house alligator and the few months he had spent in the swamp had not made of him a saurian Seminole . <p> If Alice suspected that her hero was plotting a course Big Abe never would have considered , she , for once at least , kept her sugary mouth shut about it . Where Georgie led , she followed . It must be presumed that she was on the dumb side in this ; it never sank through her skull that all the tourists glimpsed from the roadside underbrush were pale and eager when they were driving toward where she and Georgie had come from , whereas the tourists driving in the direction they were headed were all glum and tanned , with their cars loaded to the roof with souvenirs , exposed film , and sacks of citrus fruit . She kept quiet about this , but she did complain about everything else , ceaselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she fretted . <p> " Ah ' clahr , it jus ' gives me duckbumps all ovuh , nevuh knowin ' what mah foot 's goin ' to tromp on next . " <p> " It 's got to be , " Georgie explained . " You let one of these tourists see you and you 'll wind up in Milwaukee before you know what happened . They put the grab on anything that walks , flies , or crawls , these guys . " <p> " Ah 'm simply daid , " Alice moaned . " How much futhuh ? " <p> " Not far , " Georgie lied . " The scent is getting stronger all the time . " <p> " Well , Ah kai n't smell anything like Big Abe , " Alice whined peevishly . " All Ah kin smell are pralines , Bar-B-Q , and fried chicken . Which reminds me  --  " <p> " Aw , keep your hide on , " Georgie said wearily . " I 'll get you something to eat at the next pond . " <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alice . She had not worn well ; love had flown . That voice he had thought so cute was now a persistent pain in the ears . Alice was always tired or hungry or duck-bumpy . <p> Those duck-bumps gave Georgie to pause . The job of supplying her with fish from the ponds they passed was getting increasingly uncomfortable too . The water , it seemed , was not being heated properly . As a matter of fact , the whole air-conditioning system seemed to be out of kilter in these parts . <p> Georgie told himself that if Mrs. Jones had to put up with this kind of service she would be very tight-voiced over the house phone , like she had been that time the janitor at 88th and Lex had hung on a beaut and everybody had had to wear overcoats at the breakfast table . <p> Gradually it seeped into Georgie 's mind that all outdoors was getting colder . This should n't be , not if he was pointing in the direction of Key West . South should be right over there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WELCOME TO THE OLD NORTH STATE ; WHERE THE WEAK GROW STRONG AND THE STRONG GROW GREAT . NORTH CAROLINA . <p> Alice , fortunately , was facing away from the signboard , commenting acidulously on the fact that Gawgie had been able to find poor little ole her only a measly ole passel of catfish , she ' clahrred , foh her suppuh . Georgie hastily led her into a honeysuckle thicket , out of sight of that cheery , damning welcome . <p> While Alice yakked on about the quality and size of the catfish , Georgie faced the stark facts . He had spent two weeks , maybe more , leading Alice directly away from Florida , Big Abe , alligator country . Over heavens knew how many state lines ! <p> He was in a jam , and deep thought gave him four choices : He could give Alice the fast brush ; he could keep on with this Deep South kid and maybe make Manhattan before he popped his cork and gave her one in the kisser ; he could confess his error ( and Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he could loop back in a wide swing that never would let Alice know he had goofed in the first place . <p> The idea that appealed to him most was leaving Alice to yak at herself and going it alone , all the way to New York . But Georgie was a gentleman ; no matter what kind of foul ball Alice had proved to be he could n't just up and leave her stranded . To take her with him to New York  --  well , Alice was n't the type to fit in there . To tell her of his mistake was to invite a tirade that would have scarred stronger alligators than Georgie . So the looping-back idea , actually , was the only choice left to him . <p> He started on , after prodding Alice awake . He began the loop , but somewhere , somehow , he straightened out again . Without realizing it , Georgie led Alice west-northwest . <p> It grew hillier and chillier . Alice grew whinier with each step . Food got scarcer , because Georgie found he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his teeth started to chatter , spoiling his aim . Then , early one morning , he dived into a pond from a high bank and knocked himself out for a good five minutes . He came to , to hear Alice nagging at him from the bank . <p> " Jus ' floatin ' around on top of the watuh , enjoyin ' yo'self , " she pouted , " while Ah set here jus ' stahvin ' . " <p> " I ai n't floating and this ai n't water , " Georgie said groggily . " This pond is frozen over . This is ice . " <p> " Ice ? " Alice squealed . " Hahcome there 's ice in Florida when there nevah was befo ' ? " <p> " A cold wave , " Georgie said drearily . " Come on , let 's go . " <p> With Alice 's caustic comments dinning in his ears , he dragged himself along the way . He was completely lost now , if he had ever been anything else . Never had he been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view was either Rockefeller Center from the sidewalk or the Empire State from the observation platform . The very sights and sounds about him had changed ; where there had been the brisk tattoo of wrinkling fenders and the thousands of signs each proclaiming the SHORTEST WAY SOUTH , now there was the twang of the gittar , the squeak of the fiddle , the chant of " Prom-ee-nayd home ! " and signs that said STEAM HEATED . And everywhere  --  everywhere  --  bears . <p> True , the bears were all in cages adjoining gasoline pumps , but they terrified Alice and they made Georgie nervous . <p> " What paht of Florida have you lured me into , Gawgie ? " Alice demanded . " What mean trick have you played , takin ' me where there 's nothin ' but big ole beahs ? " <p> " They got a circus in Sarasota , " Georgie said lamely . " We must be close to there , huh ? " <p> It was a pretty feeble explanation and Alice was not convinced . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her that this was no part of Florida at all , that Georgie had led her astray . Suspicion became horrified conviction the morning that brought snow . <p> " What 's that ? " she shrieked when the first flakes whirled down . <p> " Orange blossoms , " Georgie tried , but as the snow thickened with a rising wind , he gave up . " It 's snow , " he confessed miserably , " and we 're lost , and from the looks of things we 're about two miles due east of the Arctic Circle . I made a wrong turn . " <p> After Alice 's hysterics had quieted to intermittent shrieks , Georgie faced stark facts again . The snow was getting deeper and showed no signs of stopping ; the ponds were freezing over and if they did not do the same themselves they would surely starve to death . Attempts to get back to warmer climes undoubtedly would wind up in Canada , if past performances meant anything . This was it , then , the time for surrender . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get you in out of this blizzard . " <p> " What are you goin ' to do ? " Alice wailed . <p> " We 're going to give ourselves up , " Georgie explained . " That last place we passed , the one that had the five bears , the monkey , and the rattlesnake  --  we 're going to turn ourselves in to that guy . " <p> " Nevuh ! " Alice cried dramatically . " Death befo ' enslavement ! " And then , as Georgie shrugged and waded off through the snow : " Way-utt fo ' little ole me ! " <p> The man who operated the Cherokee Wampum Inn and Trading Post was named Ike Popple , and Ike had the reputation in Graham County , North Carolina , of being a teetotaler . He was jealous of this reputation and that 's why he called in all the people on his party line , shouting hoarsely for them to drop whatever they were doing and come along down to his place right away to see with their own eyes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the snow outside his place . <p> As might be expected , the confusion was enormous , but when the excitement died to a mere clamor Georgie and Alice found themselves where Georgie had predicted they would be , in a warm , clean cage with plenty of food and , overhead , a frantically scrawled sign which screamed : <p> SEE THE ONLY LIVING SMOKY MOUNTAIN ALLIGATORS ! PREHISTORIC MONSTERS ! ALIVE ! ALIVE ! WONDERS OF THE AGE ! ADMISSION $1.00 <p> Ike Popple found himself with a full-blown tourist season on his hands months before the scheduled influx of flatlanders . Naturalists came and scoffed and were run out of the county by the outraged mountaineers they called liars . Other scientists published treatises holding that Georgie 's and Alice 's appearance in the Great Smokies indubitably was linked with the goings-on at Yucca Flats . Rival tradesmen upped their bear inventories without avail . One desperate competitor imported a flamingo , but the bird sickened immediately , lost its plumage , and was sent home , sneezing . Alice and Georgie were the sensation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alice ate it up . Once she got over her first stage fright , she preened herself under the admiring gaze of the goggling spectators , and as she grew more and more vain she grew more and more unbearable to Georgie . <p> Safe , secure , Alice shucked all previous " mah hero " nonsense ; now she alternately shouldered him out of the limelight and away from the weirdly assorted goodies that were tossed them by the tourists and berated him for winding up in western North Carolina while heading for Key West . The fact that she had never had it so good in her life made no difference ; Alice beat on Georgie ceaselessly when she was n't hamming it up for her audience . <p> As for Georgie , he took it . True , he knew he could open his cage any time he chose using the trick that had nearly got him shot in South Carolina that time , but he did not choose . His experiences had convinced him that he was something less than a genius at finding his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to freezing outside . Bad as it might be with Alice , it still could be immeasurably worse wherever his sense of misdirection took him . So Georgie stayed at the Cherokee Wampum Inn and Trading Post and learned to sleep 23-1/2 hours a day . <p> He was deep in slumber , but he came wide awake one evening when he heard Mrs. Jones say : " Great heavens , it 's Georgie ! " <p> He opened his eyes and found it was no dream . There they were  --  Mr. Jones , Mrs. Jones , Susie , and Nancy , staring at him in delighted wonderment . <p> " It ca n't be him ! " Mr. Jones said in awe . <p> " But it is , Daddy , " Nancy said . " There 's that place on his nose where he got it caught in the electric fan . " <p> " It is ! " Susie cried . " Oh , Georgie , we 've missed you so much ! We want you back  --  all of us ! We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And Poppa got the raise and  --  oh , Georgie , come home ! " <p> Georgie bit back the tears that threatened to flow . He yawned and hissed and wagged his tail , and then he looked around . Good luck had caught up with him at last  --  the Jones family were the only customers in the place , and Ike Popple was having his supper . Georgie hurried over to the cage door and opened it with all his old-time skill . <p> " And wheah do you think you'ah going ? " Alice asked shrewishly . <p> Georgie glanced over his shoulder and grinned . <p> " So long , Honey Chile , " he told her . " Nice knowin ' you  --  Ah sweah it was . " <p> There was some discussion among the Joneses about the ethics of reclaiming their pet without notifying Ike Popple , but love won over principle , as usual , and Georgie was smuggled out to the Joneses ' car . <p> " But , Daddy , " Nancy  --  trust her-said , " is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , old Mother Nature intends  --  " <p> That was as far as she got . Georgie reached up and gave her a nip . It was n't a hard nip nor one that would ever show , but it was the last time anybody mentioned dear old Mother Nature in Georgie 's hearing . <p>
