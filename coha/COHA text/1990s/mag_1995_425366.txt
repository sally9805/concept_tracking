Six True Confessions <p> IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT 'S EVER MORE COMPETITIVE , COMPLICATED , AND COSTLY , PARTNERS ARE CRUCIAL . BUT PARTNERS ALWAYS FIGHT . WHAT GOES WRONG ? <p> LIKE MOST CRONIES WHO GO into business together , Paul and Jim launched their courier service with a pledge to share and share alike . And share they did  --  except Jim 's reading of " alike " proved more liberal than Paul 's . An inveterate gambler , Jim assumed that ownership entitled him to help himself to cash whenever he was short . Paul put up with his partner 's peccadillo until a couple of gentlemen camped out in the foyer and demanded $2,500 for Jim 's failure to pick the Super Bowl winner . Paul locked the safe and hid the key . When Jim came back to work , he brought a guard dog , coaxed the peckish animal into Paul 's pickup , and then had the receptionist ask Paul to move his truck . <p> Not every alienated partner hires a Doberman to put teeth into a rivalry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter silence , the contract disavowal , the title grab-and-hold , the air-it-in-public revelation  --  tactics of the corporate culture that trained many of today 's partners . <p> Business-starting buddies do n't necessarily come from one family or one neighborhood anymore . Forcibly retired by mass layoffs or voluntarily emancipated from cloistered positions in manufacturing , research and development , government , science , sales , and service , today 's partner candidates constitute a mobile and unprecedented force of diverse and well-heeled talent . They 're capable of supplying capital , spreading the workload , apportioning the risk of failure , and furnishing built-in expertise that their enterprise would otherwise have to buy . Then how can they miss ? <p> The same ways as always , unfortunately . To catalog some of them , Inc. interviewed principals from scores of enterprises whose founders or owners shared  --  financially and administratively  --  their business 's operation . These six accounts typify the patterns of stress . ( Because we promised anonymity in return for frankness , names and other details have been disguised . ) " While I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A plastics fabricator was purchased as a going concern by three of its middle managers via a leveraged buyout in the late 1980s . Unexpectedly , the business returned more profit than the model had projected . Two partners contrived to gain larger shares of the bonanza by subtly pressuring out the third . They scheduled business meetings and did n't tell him . They took customers to lunch and did n't invite him . They hired assistants for themselves but none for him . They awarded themselves big raises and gave their partner only an extra week 's vacation . " They threw every humiliation at me they could think of , " the third now perceives , " but I was so absorbed with building the company that I did n't dream they were n't . " He woke up the afternoon his partners announced , " John , after you go home tonight , do n't come back . " However , John did come back  --  brandishing the exit instrument the three had signed . His partners conspired to shortchange him through that conveyance as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John complains , " and everything that was designed to benefit me , they ignored or violated . If people 's moral intentions are no good , the best legal document in the world is hooey . " " My partners were fabulous as friends ; as partners they were revolting . " A marketer for a large **31;3688;TOOLONG provider , Mark wanted to start his own telecommunications company but was too insecure to go it alone . He persuaded three pals to join him . " I was naive , and I did n't screen our business goals , " he admits . From the start , his partners ' expectations were the opposite of his . " They wanted the company to pay for their cars and to conduct meetings in the Bahamas . I wanted to plow the money back into the business . " Outvoting him , his buddies kept finding ways to " draw off the fat , " until the operation was rendered so lean that it collapsed . Now Mark does n't even nod when he passes one of his ex-chums in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpower friendship , but this one did , " he says with regret . " Where money 's involved , people change . " " I made all the decisions ; they made all the complaints . " Insurance broker Henry combined with lawyer Charles and contractor Louis to acquire a small mall ; each would put in the same capital and put out the same effort . Charles would handle the forms and filings , Louis the maintenance and construction , Henry the sales and support . But when it came to drafting a rental agreement , the lawyer told Henry , " I ca n't get to it for a few days ; if you need it now , write it yourself . " And when it came to painting , the contractor " could n't get to it , " and so on . Yet it was n't that the others were n't doing their parts that ultimately unhinged Henry , so much as that his no-show partners griped about how he did their parts : colors were wrong ; leases favored tenants . " Partners who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job questioners . " The last straw was when a pipe burst at midnight . Louis was out of town , so Henry hired a plumber . When Louis returned , he admonished Henry , saying , " You 've got to learn to shop around . I could 've found someone for half the price . " Says Henry now that he 's out : " I do n't want to have any more to do with partners . Benevolent dictatorships are the way to run a business . You take everyone 's opinion into consideration , but somebody has to be responsible in the end . That does n't tend to happen among partners . " " I spent the time ; my partner spent the dough . " Constance and Carla pitched into Cafe Latte Stores on a half-and-half basis . As their enterprise expanded past seven figures and 20 employees , Constance bore the brunt of the work , but Carla took home the same money . " You 're more skilled at management and production than I am , " is how Carla dismissed the inequity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . However much I 'm willing to do , I want you to be willing to do , too , " Constance shot back  --  in her head . She could n't bring herself to challenge Carla out loud . " I have to walk on eggshells around her , or her emotions will explode . " Constance 's conundrum : " Carla wo n't work more , and it 's not to my benefit to work less . " Her consolation : " It 's the different way we value things that 's the problem . My reward is n't money  --  it 's doing a good job . " " My partner was a self helper  --  to what was really mine . " Bob was the leading biller at one corporate-design firm , Clarence the leader at its competitor . So , leaving their respective employers in a simultaneous lurch , they started their own company . Clarence argued that as the elder , with more experience , he risked more taking on Bob than Bob did taking on him . Therefore he , Clarence , claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a compensation arrangement by which , after divvying up expenses , each partner directly pocketed the fruits of his own sales . As expected , the first year Clarence earned more . The next year , though , Bob shot ahead as unexpected and requested reconsideration of the terms . " I urged Clarence to regard me not as a risk anymore but as an asset . " Well , no asset 's going to make more than I do , was Clarence 's apparent response . He hired a support team  --  for himself , not for Bob  --  and stopped sending Bob the figures on which their take-home pay was based . Bob coaxed copies from the accounting department 's computer and discovered that his partner had siphoned off more than $10,000 . He went to Clarence and Perry-Masoned him . " OK , OK , I took it , " his partner confessed . " But I deserved it ; I had to manage that staff . " " What , me worry ? " One day when Charles was in his partner 's office , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your lawyer called , " the partner 's secretary announced , " and said the name for your new corporation has been approved . " So . He 's dropping me , Charles rightly concluded . Let him . He 'll have to buy me out according to the terms . But for how much ? Charles got an arbitrator , his partner got an arbitrator , and the two arbitrators got an arbitrator . After months of bickering , all five got a judgment : the partner was to repay the capital that Charles put in 10 years back , plus 50% , parceled out over five years . Charles got the first parcel , but when the second was due , he received in its stead news that the partner had both thrown the company into Chapter 7 and declared personal bankruptcy . <p> PHOTO : THE SASSON BROTHERS HAVE BEEN CAREFUL TO AVOID OVERLAPPING RESPONSIBILITIES , AND THEY 'VE HIRED A PRESIDENT TO ACT AS REFEREE .
