Somewhere in the Olympic Village as the partying picks up pace , it is not hard to imagine a 14-year-old girl crying . Her name is Roza Galieva . She is the gymnast from the gold-winning Unified Team who successfully fought her way to the coveted all-around competition , only to be robbed of her chance . Her coaches , in their unified wisdom , decided that one of Galieva 's teammates , Tatiana Gutsu , was more likely to bank gold even though she had flubbed during the earlier team competition . So they exaggerated a knee injury to bench Galieva , made a quick substitution and , lo , Gutsu was in . Sure enough , she won the gold . Now Gutsu 's triumph , impressive as it was , will always carry a caveat  --  " Remember ? She did n't even qualify for the all-around . " And Galieva will have to digest the bitter lesson that fairness and feelings count for nothing in gymnastics ; all that matters is winning . <P> And that , in a nutshell , may explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sant Jordi . The women 's all-around should have been an energizing high for rapt spectators . The field of competitors was so deep with talent that on any given day , the gold medal could have hung deservedly on any one of eight necks from four countries . There was enough grace to satisfy balletomanes and enough difficulty to suggest that the laws of gravity ought to be rewritten . Yet there was little of the heartwarming drama that in Olympics past enabled audiences to lose their hearts to a charismatic Olga , a mysterious Nadia or an exuberant Mary Lou . The gymnasts often seemed more like automatons than human beings . Even on the medal stand , Gutsu and her fellow medalists  --  Shannon Miller of the U.S. and Romania 's Lavinia Milosovici  --  conveyed little joy . They seemed to have not so much won as survived . <P> The men 's competition had a different feel entirely . Early in the week , the Unified Team waged a spectacular last hurrah . Its gymnasts occupied four of the top five spots , and its sixth gymnast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sport where differences are measured in thousandths of a point , the Unified Team twisted and spun to gold with more than five full points to spare over China and Japan . Coming a night after the women 's tense team competition , the exuberance of the men 's unified effort was a welcome relief . Teammates cheered and hugged and seemed to revel in the triumph of Vitali Scherbo , 20 , who took top marks in three of the six events . <P> The night of the men 's all-around , members of the Unified Team were again the ones to watch , but now they were rivals , even competing under different flags . Save for the challenge of Germany 's Andreas Wecker , there was little doubt that the ex-Soviets would sweep the medals . The only question was , In what order ? The suspense continued right to the end of the last event , when Scherbo of Belarus took the top mark on the rings , a 9.9 , which secured him the gold . Ukraine 's Grigory Misutin , 21 , took silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Azerbaijan .
