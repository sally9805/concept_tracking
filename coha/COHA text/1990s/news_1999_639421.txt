<p> This is how far things have come . This is how quickly they have shifted . The NFC is playing for the consolation prize that the AFC used to . <p> It 's hard to see how the NFC 's best teams , be it St. Louis or Minnesota or any other team out there , could beat any one of six AFC teams in Atlanta in Super Bowl XXXIV . It 's maybe the only predictable part to this unpredictable season . <p> It is the AFC 's league now . The NFC just takes up space . <p> Since the Denver Broncos reeled off two straight Super Bowl victories , the first of which ended the NFC 's 13-game streak , finally bringing glory to a conference that had n't seen any since 1983 , there has been a radical role reversal . The AFC has turned into the dominant conference that the NFC used to be . It is the big dog . <p> The difference has been the two qualities that make the difference in any football team : coaches and quarterbacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , the NFC boasted of dominant personalities and dominant coaches such as Joe Gibbs , Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells . Now Gibbs is out of football , Johnson coaches the Dolphins and Parcells coaches the New York Jets - the AFC 's Dolphins and Jets . <p> They are hardly the only coaches who have shifted conferences and shifted football 's balance of power . Mike Holmgren used to coach in Green Bay . Now he 's in Seattle , where the Seahawks have an 8-2 record and an all-time franchise-high three-game lead in the AFC West . <p> Tom Coughlin made his name as a receivers coach with the Eagles , Packers and Giants before taking the lessons he learned under Parcells , among others , to Jacksonville , where he has led the Jaguars to the NFL 's best record ( 9-1 ) this season . <p> Jeff Fisher spent his mentoring years with the Eagles , Rams and 49ers before moving on to become the coach who has transformed the Titans into one of the youngest and most ferocious defenses in the league . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Denver but did n't mature into the coach he is until he spent three seasons at San Francisco University , studying the 49ers and acing their tests . <p> Even Jim Mora - who led the Saints to a 93-74 record and four playoff appearances during 11 NFC seasons - bolted New Orleans for Indianapolis , where the Colts have become what the Cowboys were earlier this decade : a young team with offensive stars on its roster and Super Bowls on the horizon . <p> Of course , Mora does get to coach Peyton Manning , the best young quarterback in the game , just as Coughlin gets to coach Mark Brunell and Johnson gets to coach Dan Marino . The NFC has the flash of St. Louis ' Kurt Warner , whose magic carpet ride in the TWA Dome could crash at any time ; Washington 's Brad Johnson , a terrific but injury-prone quarterback , and Green Bay 's Brett Favre , who can make his opponents or his own organization cry on any given Sunday . <p> The AFC has better quarterbacks , even better coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vince Lombardi Trophy this year and in years to come . The AFC East , with Miami , Indianapolis and Buffalo , is every bit as powerful as the NFC East of the late 1980s and early ' 90s with Dallas , Washington and New York . The AFC , as a whole , is thoroughly outplaying the NFC . And now the truth should be widely known . <p> The AFC has grown up in a hurry , going from little pup to big dog . <p> The NFC is now its fire hydrant . <p> THE AFC <p> Concerned about the backlash from Monday night 's game , Chiefs president Carl Peterson contacted NFL officials and asked them to provide extra security for today 's Kansas City game at Oakland . Good thing . It could get real ugly . But then , fans at so many games do <p> After Oakland 's Darrell Russell criticized Denver guard Dan Neil 's blocking tactics and threatened to take out Broncos quarterback Chris Miller , the NFL said it would closely monitor the Raiders ' Pro Bowl defensive tackle . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record a tackle Monday night at Mile High Stadium <p> The Raiders must be the NFL 's fight club . Not only did they fight with Denver 's fans , they also fought with themselves . Rich Gannon got in the face of wide receiver Rodney Williams for not coming back to the quarterback on a pass route . Then , after Leo Araguz 's punt was blocked , defensive end Lance Johnstone and long-snapper Barrett Robbins engaged in a high-decibel shouting match . They had to be restrained . Nice team <p> If the Broncos are looking for any bulletin-board fodder for next Sunday 's game against the Chiefs , first-year Kansas City coach Gunther Cunningham may have provided some . ' That game ( Monday night ) , by all rights , Denver had no right to win , ' Cunningham said about the Broncos ' 27-21 overtime beating of the Raiders <p> While the Broncos ( 4-7 ) still harbor the longest-of-longshot hopes at making the playoffs , Bills quarterback Doug Flutie gives them no shot . ' If you go 10-6 , ' Flutie said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have to be 11-5 to get into the playoffs . ' If so , the Broncos , and a whole bunch of other teams , have been unofficially eliminated <p> Boy Blunder has done it again . For playing in a flag football game last weekend , something Ryan Leaf 's contract with San Diego forbids , the Chargers may have grounds to withhold the final $ 2.95 million installment of his $ 11.25 million signing bonus . Leaf also lied to the San Diego Union-Tribune last week . He told the newspaper he did not hurt his ankle during a flag-football game , yet home videos of the game show he did <p> There was a telling moment during Seattle 's big win at Kansas City last Sunday . After Chiefs cornerback Eric Warfield drove Seahawks quarterback Jon Kitna out of bounds , Kitna jumped back up , shoved Warfield and got in his face . ' For so long in this division , we 've been the team that got pushed around and been the team that people can intimidate , ' Kitna said . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , you 're not going to intimidate us anymore . We 're going to come out and attack you . " <p> Book it now . The Jaguars will have home-field advantage during the AFC playoffs . The only team left on their schedule with a winning record is Tennessee , whom the Jaguars play Dec. 26 at Nashville <p> One reason the Steelers ' offense is not the same is the absence of future Hall of Fame center Dermontti Dawson . A high hamstring pull has prevented Dawson from playing in Pittsburgh 's last four games , and he is not expected to suit up today . Best projection for Dawson 's return ? Dec. 2 , at Jacksonville <p> Indianapolis defensive end Shawn King and safety Tito Wooten better have hit it big in Atlantic City to help make up for the $ 264,600 they lost to Colts that day . For returning to the team hotel at 5 a.m . Sunday , hours before their game against Philadelphia , the Colts suspended King and Wooten five games each . That cost King $ 147,000 and Wooten $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team attendance policies and the NFL 's substance-abuse policy . And Wooten is no model citizen . He has been charged with domestic abuse <p> At 21 years , two months and 20 days , Colts rookie running back Edgerrin James became the youngest player in NFL history to run for 1,000 yards , topping Barry Sanders by 18 days . <p> THE NFC <p> Used to be that dome teams had no shot at the Super Bowl . Then , last season , the Falcons became the first dome team to advance to the Super Bowl . It could happen again this season . The Vikings , Rams , Colts and Seahawks - all dome teams - are legitimate Super Bowl contenders <p> Mike Shanahan 's philosophies have spread throughout the NFL . Rams coach Dick Vermeil is giving his players Monday off for each Sunday game they win , something Shanahan has been doing in Denver since 1996 . Vermeil admitted he stole the idea of Victory Mondays from Shanahan , and the St. Louis players credit it with helping to turn around their season <p> The Rams ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays . This season , the Rams ' defense has scored an NFL-high seven touchdowns in 10 games <p> Falcons safety Eugene Robinson announced last week that he is retiring . No matter how great his career - he played 15 NFL seasons at a high level for the Seahawks , Packers and Falcons - he always will be remembered as the guy who was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before Atlanta lost Super Bowl XXXIII to Denver . Always <p> This will mark the first time since the strike-shortened 1982 season that the 49ers do n't win 10 games . In fact , they 'll be fortunate to win another game the rest of the season . Remarkably , their offense has scored just one touchdown in its last 42 possessions . This should qualify 49ers quarterback Steve Young as the NFL 's most valuable player , even though he has been sidelined since Week 3 <p> Vikings running back Leroy Hoard was arrested in Miami Beach last weekend and charged with disorderly conduct and possession of a controlled substance , which police said were ecstasy pills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bye week , ' said Vikings coach Dennis Green , as if the arrest meant nothing . We do ? The Vikings apparently are so used to it , they will allow Hoard to play today <p> The Vikings have become masters of the comeback . In their past three games , they trailed the Broncos 12-0 , the Cowboys 17-0 and the Bears 14-7 before rallying to win each game <p> Even though they have signed quarterbacks Brad Johnson and Randall Cunningham to multimillion-dollar contract extensions two of the past four years , the Vikings will not do the same with Jeff George . Green said last week his team , which has little room under the salary cap , will wait until after this season to begin negotiations with George <p> The Bears have a Jim Miller who starts at quarterback and a different Jim Miller who is their director of business operations . This , as you might imagine , can create all kinds of confusion . On a recent trip to Tampa , business operations director Jim Miller went to his hotel room , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . When he went to the front desk to report the mixup , he was directed to the other Jim Miller 's room . When he got there , there was the quarterback under the covers of a king-size bed , watching a football game on TV . Wisely , business operations director Jim Miller now uses his initials on the road <p> Somebody needs to buy the Buccaneers some clocks . One week after Bucs rookie linebacker John McLaughlin was late to a special-teams meeting and deactivated for his team 's game against Kansas City , wide receiver Reidel Anthony was two hours late to his meeting . This , as expected , did not go over real well with Bucs coach Tony Dungy . Anthony was benched and now must fight it out with Bert Emanuel to regain his starting job <p> Is any team in better shape for the coming off-season than Washington ? It owns the Saints ' No. 1 pick from the Ricky Williams trade and the Panthers ' No. 1 pick as the final piece of the Sean Gilbert trade . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retaining their first-round pick as well . @p#
