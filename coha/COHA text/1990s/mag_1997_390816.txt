// IT WAS CURIOSITY THAT COMPELLED ME TO INTERVIEW THE MYSTERIOUS GRETA S. , CREATOR OF THE CYCLING FANZINE MUDFLAP I 'D READ HER FUNKY 36-PAGE UNDERGROUND MAGAZINE , FULL OF TALES ABOUT HERSELF AND HER BIKE-MESSENGER , PUNK AND URBAN-OUTLAW BUDDIES IN SAN FRANCISCO . WHO IS GRETA S. , I WANTED TO KNOW , AND WHAT IS HER PASSION FOR CYCLING AND THE URBAN LIFE ? Who is this person who dares to reveal her on-the-bike fantasies in X-rated comics ? Who-for issue - would meet and interview a guy who fixes bikes for free , and marry him by issue #7 ? Who has the energy and the attitude to almost singlehandedly create this ' zine , seven issues a year-writing , editing , hand-lettering , illustrating , and laying it out-a barely break-even labor-of-love ? I felt like some of her readers who 've turned up at her door without warning , wanting an impromptu bike tour of San Francisco and a piece of her life . No wonder she now keeps her last name secret . Carless in Califrnlia . The multi-dimensional Greta S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Feminist . New bride . Bicycle commuter . Fanzine creator . Punk/teacher . Greta is all these and more . But let 's start by saying that this ' zine-writing bicycle commuter-my excuse for the interview-owns no car . She ca n't afford it , she says , and in San Francisco it 's " more of a liability than anything else . People I know who have cars , they 're always breaking down . " Then too , the responsibility frightens her . " When I do drive somebody else 's car , like when I have to haul something , I think of all the things that could happen . What if I hit a bicyclist ? I 'd have to move ! I 'd have to quit publishing . " So bike commuting is the logical answer . Greta admits to a sort of love/hate relationship with her commute-a " really hard " five miles to the outskirts of San Francisco where she goes to school , " with hills like the Alps " and a stretch on the busy freeway without bike lanes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological power " the commute confers . " When I get there I know Hey , I rode my bike . ' There 's no place in this city I can not go on my bicycle . You 're completely independent . It 's a great feeling . " Besides , she likes to sing-punk-rock and show tunes-which she ca n't do while riding public transit . The beauty of bike riding , she observes , is that " you 're in the world and you 're not isolated , but you really have your own space .... To me , singing while I 'm riding is very important , very relaxing . " So what , she figures , if she hits a crescendo at a stoplight and the drivers look at her funny ? Pedalling for pleasure . Actually , Greta 's recreational cycling pre-dates her commuting by many miles . She bicycled as a teen in Ohio , and after moving to San Francisco in 1987 , friends showed her the delights of off-roading on Marin County 's famous Mt . Tam . Inadvertantly she fell on outlaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ride there at night , " she says laughing at herself . " I would just blissfully go over there and think , Oh , it 's great at night ! There 's nobody here ! " ' Meanwhile , she conceived Mudflap as a creative statement . It turned out that the ' zine would outlast a string of unfulfilling day jobs . " I 've never been defined by my job , " says Greta , " and none of my friends have either . The people I admire , I know them for their creative endeavor , and they do something else for money . " So it was with Greta . " I 've dug ditches , I was a janitor afterhours at a gay bar , I had a job clipping pot , if you can imagine . That did n't last very long because I do n't do drugs .... ' Not surprisingly , Mudflap has an anti-9 to 5 flavor , with jokes about " suit-and-tie guys " whom Greta figures funnel all their creative energy into corporate jobs " like selling gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-bike-repair guy , John , " got a job downtown in an office in a suit and tie . He 'd leave for work , " she remembers , " and I 'd wave out the window to him from up above where the prostitutes hang out . I 'm calling , Bye , honey ! ' and thinking , ' I ca n't believe he 's in a suit and tie and going to work , 9 to 5 . I thought I married a bike mechanic ! ' It did n't last , thank God . He got a better job . " Unfettered spirit . But if Greta considers her jobs " disposable , " Mudflap is not . " Certainly it 's more important than any of the jobs I held . " I feel like I 'm making Mudflap for people like me , " Greta explains . " People who have to live in a city ... and who are trying not to have their creative spark extinguished by their awareness of political upheavals . It 's for people who are trying to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Clearly , Greta has fun with Mud . flap . It 's packed with ' toons and illos , many by Greta herself . And it 's mostly handlettered as if to say , " Who could be so square as to type this thing ? " Besides , in the ' zine world , she says , your studio is the kitchen table , and you do n't have the budget for commercial services to create your layouts . You have to take all the original drawings , the text and any clippings to the photocopying store . There you reduce or enlarge to get everything to fit on the pages . If , when you reduce the art to the right size , the lettering shrinks too much , " you just write it over right there . That 's easier than if you use a typewriter . " Making a fanzine , she observes , is full of problems requiring creative solutions and the flexibility to turn a mistake into something usable . Mudflap and movies And it turned out that Mudflap was good preparation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 Greta enrolled fulltime at San Francisco State to study for an M.EA. in cinema . That year she created a film , Portland , based on her freight-train hopping trip to Portland , Oregon , with two friends in search of a good time . " As it turned out , we did n't have a good time-nothing catastrophic , but one girl went to jail , and the other guy , we could n't find him . It 's a lot like Mudflap . " Portland is currently touring with the Ann Arbor and Black Mariah film festivals . Her cinematic experience led to Greta 's new part-time job-one she actually likes-teaching film at California College of Arts and Crafts . " It 's so different , " says Greta , " having a job where you ca n't believe you 're getting paid to do this fun thing ! " But , with filmmaking and school devouring her dollars , Greta is in no danger of giving up her bike commute any time soon . Which , she admits , is okay since she gets " a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Public transportation , and even driving , are not quality time for thinking , " she says . " If you 're bike riding , you pedal and get the blood going right to your brain . That 's what makes it such a good time to figure stuff out . I solve a lot of my movie problems while I 'm bike riding . " Plus it prepares you for what you 're going to . I recommend it to people who do n't cycle-commute to their jobs . You get focused .
