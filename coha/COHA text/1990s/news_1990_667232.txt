<p> This Christmas , retailers are a lot like little kids who keep asking , " Is there really a Santa Claus ? " <p> They want to believe that after last year 's free-for-all of markdowns , 1990 will bring a saner Christmas . Then stores wo n't have to lure shoppers with big sales and promotions . But keeping the faith is getting tougher by the day . <p> " This is probably the most difficult Christmas to predict , " says Marvin Traub , chairman of Bloomingdale 's . <p> That should mean good news for price-conscious shoppers . Recession - real or impending - and the military buildup in the Persian Gulf are making consumers nervous . A nervous shopper is a tightfisted shopper . And tightfisted shoppers make retailers reach for the " Sale " signs . <p> " I do n't buy anything that 's not on sale , " says Jaci Mathis of Upper Marlboro , Md. , who bought her mother 's Christmas present - a pantsuit - for 50% off at Woodward &; Lothrop , a Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a loss when they mark it down . " <p> Maria Cabrera of Chicago says she makes her Christmas list , then scours newspapers for sale advertisements . " You have to go more than once , because if you wait too long ... everything is gone , " she says . <p> " There are certainly a lot of bargains out there , " says Duncan Muir of J.C . Penney , which already has marked down some prices and is offering gifts with purchases . <p> Bargain-hunters probably wo n't have to wait long before retailers are really feeling pinched . Retail revenue last week was down from a year ago , according to a survey by Arthur Anderson Co. and the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A &M; University . " This week , if the retailers ' sales figures are still disappointing , you 're going to see lots of markdowns , " says Larry Gresham , associate director of the Center . <p> Forewarned , retailers are trying hard to bring on a snowstorm of business . What they 're doing : <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of merchandise - but retailers do n't want to get stuck with a lot of unbought goods . So stores tried to order goods later , when sales projections could be more accurate , and they 've asked suppliers to be ready to ship more hot-selling items quickly . " We might have had an overabundance of things in the past , " says Francesco Cantarella of Abraham &; Straus . " We 're still keeping assortments , different varieties , but not to the same extent that we had before . " <p> If retailers do it right , that means shoppers will see inventory that is lean but not skimpy . R.H. Macy &; Co. stores have cut inventory $ 600 million from 1989 Christmas levels - but there 's still $ 3.5 billion worth of goods to choose from . At J.C . Penney , where sales are down from last year , inventory is up 6% over last Christmas , " which in any normal year would be a very modest increase , " Muir says . <p> - Dreaming up gimmicks . Retailers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're building traffic with promotions like K mart 's " One- Million-Dollar Giveaway " on Saturday , when the store will give out 10,000 gift certificates of $ 100 each . Bloomingdale 's appealed to patriotism with its $ 60 gift baskets shoppers could send to soldiers serving with Operation Desert Shield . Target , Dayton Hudson Corp . ' s discount division , wrapped specially priced gift ideas - like a glove compartment kit containing tire gauge , umbrella and flashlight for $ 10 - in red and green wrapping to nudge shoppers into plunking down dollars . Gottschalk 's in California is offering a two-for-one sale and its plush reindeer toy , Twinkles , for $ 12 with a $ 50 purchase . <p> - Picking the right merchandise . " I do n't think it 's a matter of trying to have cheaper prices at Christmas , " says Bloomingdale 's Traub . " You have to find items that will turn on our consumers . " <p> Every retailer wants to have the hot gift of the season - and they hope to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring for $ 23 . " We 'll sell tens of thousands , not because it 's inexpensive but because it 's unique , " says Traub . <p> At Target , the must-haves include Barbie , indoor grills , and tapes and CDs for stocking stuffers . At upscale Nordstrom , big sellers are traditional gifts like gloves , slippers and robes , plus exotica like hand-painted silk ties and powerhouse licensed merchandise like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle clothing . " The most important thing this year is the quality quotient , " says Loeb . <p> Retailers are " pretty well prepared " to woo wary shoppers , says Rosalind Wells , chief economist of the National Retail Federation . " Of course , you can never be prepared for extremely slow consumer spending . " <p> What retailers want to avoid but probably wo n't : last year 's markdown melee . Prices were slashed early and often by retailers like Macy 's and Campeau Corp . ' s Bloomingdale 's , Rich 's , Burdine 's and Jordan Marsh , all desperate for cash to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps for promotions , they all will . That 's what 's going to hurt " the retailers , says Richard Mercier , analyst for Moody 's Investor Services . <p> Regional economic differences will mean some retailers will do better than others . The Northeast and California are slumping , the Midwest is fair and the Northwest and South are still doing well . " Santa Claus will probably bypass New England and New York and save his goodies for the rest of the country , " says economist Carl Steidtmann of Management Horizons , a consulting firm . <p> Some specialty stores will sail through relatively unscathed . The Gap , which has a successful new line of infants and toddlers ' clothing , is likely to do well . Wal-Mart , which has racked up double-digit sales increases all year , should continue to do so . Toys R Us , which dominates toy retailing , will probably sail through . " One of the last things parents will cut back on is presents for their kids , " says vice chairman Robert Nakasone . <p> Veronica Chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . " I 'll go back as close as two weeks before Christmas , " especially for children 's clothes , she says . <p> There 's always the possibility that consumers will throw caution to the winds , shop till the numbers wear off their credit cards , and ignore January 's day of reckoning . " Consumers rarely do what they say they 're going to do , " Wells says . <p> " If the retailers will wait it out - and I do n't expect them to - consumers are going to start buying late in the season , " says Gresham . " They 're going to buy for Christmas just like they always buy for Christmas . " <p> But for every retailer hopefully putting out milk and cookies for Santa , there 's a Grinch saying not to bother . " I do n't see the consumer as being out there spending , " says Mercier of Moody 's . " There 'll be a lot of people at flea markets this year .
