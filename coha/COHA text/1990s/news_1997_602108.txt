<p> The world and its media hardly blinked when a tour bus crashed in India in the spring of 1996 . <p> Today , the reverberations of that crash echo through a nervous college community where just about everyone knows it as " the Semester at Sea tragedy . " <p> Unfolding in horrific detail in crates of documents piling up in courthouses and law offices nationwide , it is the story of four U.S. college students who died on the adventure of their lives when their bus careened off a highway and tumbled into a crumpled heap . <p> The accident is among a recent series of deaths , injuries and illnesses that are prompting a widespread re-evaluation of study abroad  --  that quiet , cliquish , centuries-old corner of the American college scene . <p> With an expected 100,000 college students planning to study abroad this year , universities are re-examining how they run their programs , with particular focus on safety and liability . <p> Parents are demanding schools shoulder blame for death and injury and beef up training for program leaders . And lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in state and federal courts , forcing all sides to determine who is responsible for taking care of students thousands of miles from home . <p> The move to ensure student safety has taken on a new urgency as more students travel to countries once considered too risky because of disease or terrorism or politics . <p> Just this summer , students from Indiana were caught in political strife in Cambodia , while in Ecuador , the wife of the tour director for a group of University of New Mexico students was shot to death by robbers . <p> " We 're madder than hell our daughters were killed , " says Anne Schewe , mother of 20-year-old Sara , one of the students who died in the India bus crash . <p> Now , Schewe is party to a lawsuit against the program operators and the University of Pittsburgh , trip sponsor . It 's a suit that 's being closely watched as a test case with the potential to substantially change the way study abroad programs operate . <p> If the suing parents are successful , " It wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal monetary recovery , " says John Amato , whose daughter , Virginia , also died in the crash . " It will be the size of the check as a wake-up call . " <p> The call ca n't come soon enough for reformers like Gary Rhodes , who says the study abroad industry has " no real definition of what the minimum standards are . " <p> Rhodes , program coordinator in the University of Southern California Office of Overseas Studies , says it 's no wonder " you have issues falling through the cracks . " <p> But things are changing . Schools have quit being travel agents because of potential liability and are tightening insurance requirements . Waivers warning students of danger are standard , and the industry is coming to grips with the dilemma of how much to tell students about past deaths and injuries . <p> No one knows how many American students studying overseas are injured , fall seriously ill or die each year . No one keeps track . And even as the 350 schools sponsoring study-abroad programs pump out lavish brochures inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a tight lid on past troubles . <p> Their reluctance to disclose anything negative is not unusual . It took a 1990 act of Congress , for example , to force schools to release records of crimes that occur on campus . <p> The rising tide of litigation , however , has not gone unnoticed . <p> " We 've been good , " says Bill Cressey , a vice president at the Council on International Education Exchange , a major player and influence in the industry . " But we 've also been lucky . So we 're now saying , ' Let 's re-examine everything . ' " <p> Robert Aalberts , professor of legal studies at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , agrees that luck has been on the side of the sponsors . <p> But Aalberts , who has written on the subject of study abroad liability , believes schools are " lucky there has been so little litigation , vs. a fair number of problems . . . . Some tragic things have happened . " <p> Among them : an alleged rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parasitic disease inflicted by a fruit fly bite in Costa Rica ; murder and banditry in Ecuador ; a killing in Moscow ; the bus crash in India . <p> At the heart of the lawsuits spawned by some of these incidents is a gap in the understanding between schools and families over how much responsibility for students ' safety the schools must bear . <p> The schools consider their charges informed adults who are given plenty of warning and guidance on avoiding perils overseas . To reinforce those caveats , most schools require students or parents to sign waivers absolving sponsors of liability when something goes awry . <p> The families insist their children are entitled to a special measure of supervision and protection while temporarily living abroad . <p> The Amatos were typical . <p> As they shared their daughter 's exuberance over the prospect of an around-the-world tour on a top-drawer program , they weighed the risks . Aware that the greatest dangers await students who strike out on their own , they insisted she stick to outings planned and supervised by the organizers . They went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability in the event of accidents . Then they entrusted 20-year-old Virginia 's life to a known and respected institution : the University of Pittsburgh . <p> " These people held themselves up as experts , " says Amato 's wife , Virginia . " We had a tremendous measure of confidence . Obviously , it was misplaced . " <p> Programs popular <p> Once considered a perk of the intellectually or financially elite , foreign study is increasingly popular . Schools emphasizing language and international studies make travel almost mandatory . Middlebury ( Vt . ) College , for instance , will send 370 students to 34 countries this year , putting more than half of its junior class in study abroad . <p> Peterson 's Study Abroad 1997 , a popular guide , lists more than 1,500 recognized programs in 90 countries offered through 350 accredited U.S. and foreign schools . <p> Hundreds more programs operate in rented space on prestigious campuses the world over . <p> An increasing number of high schools also are sending groups on foreign cultural junkets , though for much shorter periods . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cost and accessibility , increasing numbers of young people are going to countries once considered politically off-limits or otherwise dangerous , raising the odds for trouble . <p> In the last several months , a dozen Indiana Wesleyan University students got caught up in the Cambodian fighting . They escaped unharmed , with the group leader and two students barely making the last plane out before authorities closed the Phnom Penh airport . <p> In Ecuador , the wife of the study tour director from the University of New Mexico was murdered by thugs in a situation the State Department specifically warns travelers to avoid . Her two children and 12 university students watched in horror as she was gunned down by fleeing bandits . <p> Right now , though , every eye in the tight circle of foreign study administrators is focused on Pittsburgh , home of the prominent and popular overseas study program known as Semester at Sea . <p> Floating classroom <p> Semester at Sea , run by the Institute for Shipboard Education , is a private non-profit group that operates out of the University of Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world on its " floating classroom "  --  a cruise ship named Universe Explorer . Since the program began in 1963 under the name World Campus Afloat , 30,000 students have participated . Another 585 sail Sunday from Vancouver for a four-month voyage . <p> It has an excellent safety record . <p> Tuition , room , board and incidentals can run $ 20,000 per student , including side trips at about a dozen ports of call . Students can pick from about 275 side trips , organized to give them an opportunity to soak up local history and culture . <p> An hour before midnight on March 27 , 1996 , on the fabled Grand Trunk Road from Delhi to Agra , one of the side trips turned into disaster . <p> A last-minute scheduling mix up put the students on a plane from Varanasi to Delhi , not to Agra as advertised . The students were shocked to discover they would then ride on buses for six hours from Delhi to Agra . One of the buses , carrying 27 Americans , swerved and careened into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The multiple lawsuits filed by parents of the students who died charge the University of Pittsburgh and the program operators with negligence . <p> " Negligence in placing those students on that bus for six hours in darkness , " says Bob Unterberger , one of the lawyers for the families . <p> The families will argue that planning for the side trip was sloppy , that the people in charge made a bad decision , that the bus operator was an unknown and that everyone should have known that the road to Agra is a death trap by night . <p> Pitt and the Semester at Sea operators will argue that they have been on that road before , that their Indian tour arranger had worked for them for years and that they took every necessary precaution . <p> And they also will say that students and parents should understand that overseas study is not risk free . <p> " While we have a family environment on board and I and other . . . staff are concerned about the welfare of all individuals , it does not alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about studying abroad , " says John Tymitz , executive director of Semester at Sea . " Students and their parents need to be aware that there are certain risks inherent in any kind of travel . " <p> John Lillis , the lawyer for Semester at Sea and Pitt , blames study abroad lawsuits on " an attitude in our society that any time something happens it has to be someone 's fault and therefore someone must pay . I respectfully disagree . . . . Things in our lives just occur . " <p> The outcome of the litigation , which could take years to resolve , will be far-reaching because for the first time , two areas of case law converge . The case will test the limits of liability as defined by travel law . It will also have courts define more precisely the extent of a school 's duty to protect its students on and off campus . <p> But the case is about more than blame and obligation . It 's about young lives cut short . <p> " Every parent shudders at the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amato , a prominent lawyer in New Orleans . " But it 's an experience you would n't wish on an enemy . We 're a year and a half into this , and numbness still surrounds us . " <p> Far from being numbed , however , the study abroad industry dwells on every detail of the tragedy and its ramifications , legal and moral . Some contend the nightime crash on a notoriously Wild West kind of road was what it took to shake the establishment from its lethargy . <p> Bill Hoffa , a consultant on international education who helped craft a new handbook for study abroad advisers , wo n't go so far as to say all schools had inadequate safety measures . But , he says , " The field was sleeping on this . " <p> The revised guide put out by the industry 's main professional group now has a chapter on liability and safety . But even this widely consulted handbook , published by the Association for International Educators , reveals how much still cries out for clarification : <p> " The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , " is a murky one . " <p> Effect of tragedy felt <p> Regardless of how the Semester at Sea cases are resolved , they are having an impact already . <p> Seminars on liability and risk management that once begged for audiences are now a priority at study abroad conventions . Professional groups are joining forces to try to agree on how the responsibilities of students , parents and schools can be more clearly spelled out in advance . Schools are auditing how they prepare students for overseas study and how they handle emergencies . <p> " To be frank , " says Cressey , of the Council on International Education Exchange , " my most recent initiative in the safety area is really in part a response to the letters those ( Semester at Sea ) parents wrote . " <p> Much of the trouble and heartbreak , however , is beyond the scope of responsibility even common sense would assign to the schools . The vast majority of deaths and injuries during foreign study , however many there might be , happen while students are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , many involve drinking and drugs . <p> In some countries , says Richard Atkins of the International Legal defense Counsel , " students try to emulate their hosts by overimbibing . " <p> No matter the locale , he says , fights , traffic accidents and sexual assaults can almost always be traced to alcohol . <p> The manuals used by program supervisors are clear on drugs . " There is no such thing as TOO stern a warning about drug use , " advises one . <p> Semester at Sea has had its share of random tragedy : A student on a motorbike was struck and killed by a truck in Bali in 1973 ; a student died in a fall aboard ship in 1974 ; a student died in a fall from a pyramid in 1980 ; a student drowned in Sri Lanka in 1989 ; a student hiking at night died in Taiwan in 1993 ; a student jumped from the ship and died on the pier in Venezuela in 1995 . <p> But until March 1996 , Semester at Sea had not experienced a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students it has escorted around the world and the propensity for young people to take risks , its safety record , by any measure , is good . <p> " We believe students are safer on board our ship than they are on their home campuses , " says Tymitz . <p> " The program puts a lot of thought into where they go and how they prepare you , " says Stuart Saunders , a 1984 Semester at Sea grad active in its alumni group . " Life inherently carries risk . " <p> How much risk , however , is hard to say . <p> " The only way we find out about " overseas accidents , says professor Aalberts , " is if it gets into the mainstream media or gets appealed . A lot of time universities wo n't disclose what 's going on . They 're afraid it will taint their reputations . " <p> Even now , the study abroad establishment is at odds over how much prospective students should be told about past troubles . <p> Despite this panoply of problems , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the families of the victims of tragedies , want study abroad shut down . They simply ask for disclosure , clearer delineation of who is responsible and safe programs . <p> " We do n't want to scare parents off , " says Anne Schewe . " We just want to instill in the kids the fear of God . " <p> DO YOUR HOMEWORK BEFORE GOING ABROAD <p> If you 're planning to study abroad , experts and guidebooks suggest : <p>  --  Ask for details on crime , illness , accidents and other perils encountered by students in the past , and ask what has been done to avoid reoccurrences . <p>  --  Find out how host families are screened and whether you can move to a different family if a problem develops . <p>  --  Be clear on what is covered when you sign a release form . Conversely , know when and how to blow the whistle if you feel safety or health is being compromised . <p>  --  Find out which staff member on site is responsible for safety , health and security , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p>  --  Ask about health and safety standards applied to providers of transportation , tours , cultural programs and housing . <p>  --  Get in writing how your study will be credited . <p>  --  Be absolutely sure about insurance coverage away from home , regardless of what the school offers , requires or recommends . Understand how and to what extent costly medical evacuations are covered . <p>  --  Invest in a student ID card issued by the Council on International Education Exchange . The $ 20 charge identifies the bearer as a student and entitles the carrier to health and accident insurance , $ 25,000 toward medical evacuation ( in which cases students must be transported elsewhere for treatment ) and $ 7,500 toward repatriation of remains . <p> Check out these Web sites for more information : <p> **35;1522;TOOLONG , the University of Southern California 's site . <p> **25;1559;TOOLONG , which has country-by-country highway fatality data . <p> **36;1586;TOOLONG , the State Department 's travel warnings .
