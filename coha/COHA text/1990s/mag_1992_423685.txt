Section : U.S. News Clinton starts creating an eclectic team and pondering foreign crises <p> Bill Clinton reminded advisers last week of his eagerness to announce some dramatic initiatives immediately after his swearing-in . Obligingly , they are writing an ambitious plan to be unveiled during his first week in office , including the details of his long-touted national-service program , the outlines of a welfare-reform initiative and substantial cuts in the federal bureaucracy . <p> After weeks of deliberation , the Clinton transition operation has begun to bear fruit . Clinton 's first cabinet and White House staff announcements highlighted what an eclectic affair his administration will be . For his economics team , Clinton went for doyens of the Establishment who could work well together to sell and implement his policies ; on social policy , he went for innovators from diverse backgrounds . And in foreign affairs , he began to steel himself for the tough challenges he had once hoped to put off . <p> Measured by its public revelations and its private struggles , the Clinton transition is proceeding at different paces on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton presidential style : <p> The domestic plan . Though there is so much ferment at transition headquarters that phone directories are updated every 24 hours , Clinton does the crucial decision making by himself . His economic appointments suggest that he has settled on a strategy of long-term deficit reduction with modest tinkering on short-term economic problems ( story , Page 49 ) . His team : Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary , Rep. Leon Panetta as budget director with deficit hawk Alice Rivlin as his deputy , and investment bankers Roger Altman as deputy Treasury secretary and Robert Rubin as coordinator of economic policy at the White House . The choices reassured Wall Street and the business community that the 46-year-old president-elect wo n't do anything fiscally rash . The economic lineup is another step in showing he is a different kind of Democrat , ' says Clinton domestic adviser Al From , head of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council . He knows that growth must be generated in the private sector as a prerequisite for expanded opportunity . ' <p> Other appointments fit the Team Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They put a premium on new ideas for governing and they are aimed at satisfying key constituency groups , including feminists and environmentalists . The nominees : Donna Shalala , a top Carter administration official , as Health and Human Services secretary ; Robert Reich , a Harvard teacher , as labor secretary ; economist Laura D'Andrea Tyson as head of the Council of Economic Advisers , and Carol Browner , a former aide to Vice President-elect Al Gore , as head of the Environmental Protection Agency . <p> To reinforce Clinton 's commitment to change and to balance the conservative bent of the economic team , the Justice Department is likely to be an incubator for Clinton 's liberal impulses on social issues such as civil-rights enforcement for minorities , women and gays . Another initiative that Clinton stressed during the campaign will be carried out quickly by Justice : beefing up the federal role in collecting child-support payments from delinquent parents of poor children . <p> Clinton clearly thinks the country wants government to enter a new era of innovation and experimentation . His aides , concerned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inconsistency is inevitable . Clinton 's first round of welfare reform , for example , is likely to include his long-promised expansion of the earned-income tax credit so no head of household who works full time falls below the poverty level . That should appeal to progressives , but Clinton advisers admit they do n't have adequate cost estimates . Yet Clinton also is eager to show his commitment to cutting back the government , and has pledged an across-the-board , 3 percent reduction in administrative costs for the federal bureaucracy that includes trimming 100,000 jobs through attrition . His campaign claimed that the jobs cut alone would save $15 billion over four years . That would please conservatives . The nation will have to live with such contradictions for the next four years . <p> Foreign woes . Improving the economy and rejuvenating domestic policy may be the easy part . Even now , foreign crises are pressing in on Clinton , diverting his energies and bollixing his plans . <p> Transition-team members now acknowledge that Clinton will have to deal almost immediately with flashpoints abroad . Topping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when and how to extract American troops ; Bosnia , where suffering could soon reach Somalia-like proportions ; the rest of the former Yugoslavia , where Serbian aggression threatens to spread and to drag in neighboring states , and Haiti , where his campaign pronouncements have caused Clinton untold grief . <p> U.S. News has learned that American officials have told Clinton 's aides that tens of thousands of Haitians , encouraged by Clinton 's criticisms of Bush 's policy of turning back all boat people , are now preparing to make a run for the United States around the time of Clinton 's inauguration . Bush officials have urged Clinton to make a strong statement to lower expectations ' and head off a massive boatlift . They hope to broadcast it to the island through the Voice of America . If he waits until his inauguration on January 20 , it will be far too late , ' warns one senior administration official . Clinton is very aware of the problem and will soon get a report on policy options from Rep. Stephen Solarz , who recently visited Haiti . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some key officials at the State Department and the Pentagon have been told by Clinton transition staffers that they can keep their jobs for at least several more months to provide continuity . At State , for example , Assistant Secretary for the Near East Edward Djerejian , a career Foreign Service officer and former ambassador to Syria , is expected to stay in his post , along with several midlevel officials who have been guiding the sensitive Mideast peace talks . <p> Some associates suggest that even the politically astute Clinton has been surprised by the powerful reverberations his every utterance as president-elect sets off around the world , in foreign ministries , in financial markets  --  even among ordinary folks in Somalia , Russia and Haiti . His call for an end to the ban on gays in the military , for example , caused scarcely a ripple during the campaign , but it created an immediate furor when he mentioned the idea briefly after the election . <p> Last week , Clinton admitted that foreign policy would take up considerably more time than he had thought . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are worried that , as a foreign-policy neophyte , he will rely too much on a small cadreof advisers , including Samuel Berger and Anthony Lake , senior State Department officials during the Carter administration . If so , he would be the mirror image of Bush , who concentrated on foreign affairs while deferring on domestic matters to a few advisers like White House Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman . Still , it is clear Clinton now realizes the urgency of acting on several fronts . Advisers think he will soon call for tougher steps against Serbian aggressors  --  perhaps by more rigorous enforcement of the no fly ' zone in Bosnia  --  if Bush does not act on that issue soon . Clinton could gain instant foreign-policy credibility by naming Gen. Colin Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Ronald Reagan 's former national-security adviser , to a senior job such as secretary of state . Clinton aides say Powell is under consideration for several posts . <p> Not only will foreign crises intrude on Clinton 's attention , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , it is becoming clear that his idea of imposing deep cuts on the Pentagon is more complicated than the campaign rhetoric suggested . General Powell has adroitly put the military into an entirely new growth industry  --  humanitarian relief . More important , the job losses from scaled-down , defense-related industries could be too great for the domestic economy to handle  --  as would the release of an additional 200,000 military personnel into the job market , which Clinton is contemplating . If he can not get substantial budget savings from the Pentagon , that will make it much tougher for him to keep his promises to spend more on infrastructure investment , education and other social goals or to reduce the deficit . <p> The unending campaign . One special priority for Clinton is the new administration 's political machinery . Political adviser David Wilhelm , a likely choice for Democratic national chairman or White House political director , is helping to construct an organization based on four building blocks that would expand the sophisticated operations of Ronald Reagan 's White House . It would maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close coordination with the Democratic National Committee ; reach out to mayors , governors and other officials under an **25;411;TOOLONG division ; create an elaborate system for strengthening links to constituency groups sympathetic to the administration , such as organized labor , women entrepreneurs , environmentalists , gays and the disabled , and , most important , establish an aggressive public-liaison office to appeal to average voters , especially Americans unhappy with the inattentiveness of government who supported independent candidate Ross Perot . <p> The permanent campaign was on display last week : The members of the new economics team were immediately marched from their well-rehearsed introductory press conference to a studio where Bentsen did interviews with local television stations hooked up by satellite . It will also be evident this week , in the staging of Clinton 's style-over-substance economic conference . Moreover , aides say Clinton has been impressed with the capital-for-a-day program used by former Ohio Gov . Richard Celeste in which the governor and key cabinet members visited small towns and medium-sized cities to answer questions . Clinton hopes to replicate the system nationally , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen forums . <p> Since so many of the ideas flow from the top , Clinton 's transition team seems more and more a make-work operation , with transition researchers expending their energies on academic-style studies of the federal bureaucracy . A standard questionnaire submitted to agency heads includes eight pages of often hypothetical queries and three more pages of questions about management organization . One example : What major ( more than $200 million or 10 percent ) savings are incorporated in the current services baseline that are based on management reforms or administrative actions that have not been fully implemented ? ' A senior Bush adviser suspects that the Clintonians ' objective is to save money by accelerating reforms already begun under Bush . As tough as the Oval Office job now seems to Clinton , that might not be such a bad idea . <p> PHOTO : Staturesque . Budget deputy designee Rivlin is a hard-liner on the deficit .

Has he put together the ideal team to carry out his agenda while satisfying his many constituencies ? Will a certain appointee be a power player or wind up as a bureaucratic afterthought ? These and other portentous questions suggest that there is a science to making the staffing decisions Clinton is facing . The truth is that there is no sure-fire formula to measure leadership qualities in advance , whether the nominee is a member of Congress , a judge , a business executive or an academic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Colby College political scientist who studies cabinet appointments . <p> Congressional record . Clinton seems to think that congressional experience provides a clue to success . By appointing Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary and Rep. Leon Panetta as Office of Management and Budget director , he took the extraordinary step of placing two sitting members of Congress at the helm of his economic team . The congressional record , however , is spotty in recent administrations . Some lawmakers , such as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp , have drawn on a reserve of political savvy or substantive knowledge to stretch beyond their Capitol Hill perspectives . But Kemp 's aggressiveness  --  useful as a member of Congress 's Republican minority  --  has tended to make his stay on the Bush team troubled . And other former congressmen , such as Carter administration Transportation Secretary Brock Adams and current interior chief Manuel Lujan , have lacked either executive flair or close rapport with the presidents who appointed them . <p> For the job of attorney general , Clinton is looking at several judges , another group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , presidents have often turned to judges to improve a department 's tarnished image . Griffin Bell was Jimmy Carter 's attorney general , one of a string of judges who have headed law-enforcement or intelligence agencies . Others include William Webster ( FBI and CIA ) and William Sessions ( FBI ) . Bell , however , in the words of a rival , had a good mind but little political sense . ' And insiders give the judges mediocre marks for administrative skills , noting that the ability to write fine legal opinions may not translate into carrying out policy shifts in massive bureaucracies . <p> Even if Clinton manages to avoid his predecessors ' personnel pitfalls , some occupants of cabinet-room chairs will no doubt surprise him . In 1968 , many expected that the star of Richard Nixon 's first cabinet would be Housing Secretary George Romney , a success as the head of American Motors and as Michigan 's governor . Few paid attention to a little-known ex-business-school dean whom Nixon had nominated as labor secretary .
