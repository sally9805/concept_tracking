THREE WOMEN HAVE VANISHED , a mother , her teenage daughter , and the daughter s friend-purses and cars left behind , TV on , door unlocked . The daughter had plans to spend the day at the lake with friends and never showed . The phone has rung and rung all morning , unanswered . Puzzled friends walk through the interrupted house , sweep up broken glass from a porch light before calling the police . Broom bristles , shoe soles , finger pads smearing , tamping down , obscuring possibilities . Neighbors come forward , vague . It was late , they say . A green van , a white truck seen in the area , trolling . A man with longish brown hair , army jacket , slight to medium build . Down by the train tracks , panties . A single canvas sneaker . <p> Details are not clues . What happened ? Police conjecture an intruder or intruders intended only to deal with the mother , to rob or to rape . The girls ' arrival was unexpected . Panicking , the perpetrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloppy , dribbling evidence all the way to some lair . But little is found : a single drop of blood in the foyer , but it belongs to a friend-she nicked her finger while sweeping glass . We 're aghast at all the friends who tidied up . No alarm in broken glass ? Those purses ; women do n't leave their purses . <p> There is truth and there is rumor . The missing daughter , Vicki , has not been particularly close to the missing friend , Adelle , since junior high . They went in different directions-the stocky , glossy Vicki somewhat of a party girl , her hair bleached yellow-white against iodine skin ; Adelle the more academic and wholesomely cheerleaderish one , willowy and fine-boned . Graduation-party nostalgia brought them back together that night , where they let bygones be bygones , forgiving the small betrayals . Adelle called home to say she 'd be spending the night at Vicki 's the first time in almost four years . Her shiny compact car blocks the driveway to show she made it as far as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take every day . Early on , this is what worries her parents most . They circle the town doggedly , their station wagon filled with flyers , her face emblazoned on their sweatshirts . Please . If you know anything , anything at all . In a video they lend to the TV stations , she is modeling gauzy , diaphanous wedding gowns for a local dressmaker . With her skirts and hair swirling , her perfect , pearly teeth , we feel that she is innocent and doomed . <p> Of the missing mother Kay and daughter Vicki , we are not so sure . Their estranged husband/father can not immediately be located . Vicki once had a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend , and he is taken in for questioning . He is at first sullen and uncooperative with investigators . With grim confidence we await his confession , but he foils us : a punched timecard and security video corroborate his third-shift presence in the chicken parts processing plant that night . The husband/father likewise disappoints . He is not on the lam but simply lives out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the son/brother too . They are briefly suspected , then cleared . But there is another shady matter . Kay ran a beauty parlor with increasingly disreputable ties . Some say she laundered money for drug dealers and got greedy , funneling too large a share for herself . The police deny all that , but we note her expensive tastes , the leather in her daughter 's wardrobe , and conclude the worst . <p> Still , each of the three might have her own reasons for wanting to disappear . Kay had maxed out her credit cards and was falling behind in her mortgage payments . Was Vicki pregnant ? Some say police found an unopened urine-test kit in her bureau . Adelle the consummate perfectionist was failing precalculus . Running off might have been easier to contemplate as a group : the girls plotting new looks in better towns ; Kay mulling the practical details of bus tickets and low-profile jobs . We can not rule out anything , but the strongest current is foul play , not the gentle fantasy of escape that we all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the search kicks into high gear . Divers slick in neoprene suits bob the shallow lake as if for apples , rake the algaed muck along the bottom . City workers sonar the reservoir . The waters yield nothing , but the surrounding woods still swarm promisingly with hunters and hounds . We admire those who have volunteered to don orange caps and peer through binoculars , their dogs fanning out ahead and weaving through trees , loyal noses snuffling the ground . We admire the highway patrolmen in their thin summer khakis , poised in the roadside gravel , persistent but polite at the roadblocks checking licenses . The churchwomen bring pies and fried chicken and same morning , a woman resembling the missing mother burst into the store , asked if he had seen two teenage girls , and stormed out when he said he had n't . She sometimes bought cigarettes there , and milk in singleserving containers . <p> The graduation party attendees are questioned further . The girls were spotted leaving the party together at 1:00 , 2:00 , and 3:00 A.M. The hostess thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a borrowed necklace . The hostess 's parents said both girls were polite and charming but seemed troubled . The hostess 's boyfriend saw them hugging on the lawn . Others said the lawn embrace was a brawl ; Vicki had Adelle in a chokehold . Or Adelle held Vicki while she vomited malt liquor onto the zinnias . Unless it was n't those two at all . The salutatorian has his doubts . Around 1 : 30 , he says , he was sitting alone on the back patio . He had turned down a joint only to have the smoke blown into his ear , leaving him giddy and fretful and confused . He is going to Yale in the fall , and the prospect was then lying heavily on his mind . Now he feels relief and a delightful anticipation of leaving , but that night he brooded while the full moon silhouetted two figures dancing together on the lawn . The salutatorian watched in darkness two moving bodies he could identify as female by their shapes , the pitch of the laughter . It 's possible they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recall . Police seize his journals but return them the next day , almost dejected . His nervous intelligence seemed so promising-a budding sociopath ? - but his journals hold only the sex-obsessed ramblings of run-of-the-mill adolescence : " May 5-Would absolutely rut Bethany R. given half a chance . Tits like grapefruit , and she smells like bubble-gum-flavored suntan lotion and sex . " <p> The time is ripe for confessions , so people start to confess , as if in fits of misguided volunteerism . Some march right into the police station or the newspaper editor 's office . Some hold press conferences . A man calling himself a freelance private eye and soldier of fortune says he helped the women conceal their identities and relocate , to where he is forbidden to disclose , but rest assured they are alive and well , enjoying lucrative careers in finance . A youth generally regarded as troubled leads police and reporters to an empty culvert , an empty railcar , and on a hike through acres of empty field . A woman claiming to be one of the missing women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles none-and is vague about the other two , saying only that they ditched her . Her parents persuade her to recant . A group calling itself the Urban Tide says they have taken the women hostage in belated protest of the U.S. invasion of Grenada . They are revealed to be performance artists living off college fellowships . They say their intention was to " tweak the media and thereby tweak collective perceptions . " the laughter . It 's possible they kissed or only whispered . He is pale and There is talk of dismantling the university 's theater arts program altogether , which is hotly debated until the diversion of Vicki 's exboyfriend 's appearance in a television interview . <p> He reaffirms his innocence and describes their first date : they had agreed to meet at the football game . She had not permitted him to kiss her that night . The first thing he admired about her was how she blew smoke rings " like she was forty years old or something . " They dated for two years and got pre-engaged . She loved redhots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of school and sweeping up her mother 's shop . The restraining order grew out of a misunderstanding , he explains . He was a jealous guy , he admits . She could be sort of a flirt , but no more than that , he is careful to emphasize . No speaking ill of the missing . He has grown up a lot since then , he swears , and his former guidance counselor agrees in a pretaped clip . What 's next for this wrongly accused young fellow who has stolen all our hearts ? He 's studying for his General Equivalency Diploma and plans to enter technical school . Weekends he fishes with Dad and brothers . <p> Lovely Adelle had ( has ? we must be careful with what tenses imply ) no boyfriend . She seemed unapproachable , schoolmates say . Boys were intimidated by her height and her perfect smile . She carried herself as if maybe she thought she was a little better than everyone else . We detect the trace of a smirk in her wedding-dress video . Her parents start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever circling the town , meeting with the police chief , presiding over candlelight vigils . We ca n't help but wonder : Do n't they have to work ? The friendly wood panels on their station wagon begin to come across as less than sincere . When Adelle 's face appears alone on a billboard and a separate award fund is established from her college savings , we say they are elitist . Someone rents a billboard featuring only the faces of the other two , and passers-through unfamiliar with the case think they are unrelated disappearances . <p> The paper still presents them as a united front , the Missing Women , and prints their photos side by side in equal rectangles . The rectangles have shrunk , though , and are relegated to the B section except on Sundays , when a summary appears on the front page featuring the best of the tip cards and the psychic du jour . In the absence of verifiable fact , reporters track the psychics ' emanations and contribute wispy , artful meditations on the nature of truth . One suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local archetypes : Kay the divorced mom , Vicki the short-skirted slattern , Adelle the model child from a better neighborhood . Cruise any strip mall in town , muses the reporter , and you will see several of their ilk . Subscriptions to the paper take a nosedive until the reporter resigns and a larger-format , full-color TV schedule is introduced . <p> How we are holding up : Summer presses on , August flares . As the phones ' ringing wanes , crime-line volunteers drop off reluctantly , like rose petals . Friends and relatives of the missing women who have flocked here must return to their towns , jobs , more immediate families . There is no such thing as indefinite leave unless you are the missing women . Flyers in windows start to flap at the edges , tape losing its tack . Still , church attendance remains up . Moonlight strolls are kept to a minimum . Locksmiths ca n't install deadbolts quickly enough . Neighborhoods stay illuminated by floodlights and seething with attack dogs . Psychologists from the university advise us , in these prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another and to get plenty of rest and light to moderate exercise . Sixty-four percent of residents polled believe there will be more disappearances . Seventy-nine percent say the missing women are dead . Eleven percent believe the supernatural was involved . Two percent suggest they know something about the disappearance that the rest of us do n't and they are n't telling . The poll has a two percent margin of error . <p> Our police chief is often spotted raking a hand through his thin , whitening hair , loosening his collar . He has gained thirty pounds . We worry that the ordeal will force him into early retirement . For the most part we appreciate what he has done for the town , keeping both the leftist fringe and the religious zealots at bay to preserve our moderate sensibilities . Whereas our mayor is perceived to be an ineffectual weasel , the apprehended drunk drivers , college rowdies , neo-Nazis , drug dealers , and other riffraff can attest that our police chief has kept the peace . But even he can not collar this invisible threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving only their plaintive , flat faces pressed against yellowing planes of paper , asking everyone : Have you seen us ? August simmering down , the newspaper finally succumbs to investigative inertia . No news is no news ; they 've been carrying the missing women for weeks now without a new development . Journalism must prevail ; the women 's photos are sponged from the B pages . Without the newspaper 's resolve , we let the fair distract us , then a strike at the chicken parts processing plant , then the college students ' return to town . There 's talk of rebuilding the stadium . We have our hands full . <p> The mayor orates , finally . This tragedy has torn at the heart of our community , he says . We are shocked , saddened , and bewildered , he says . Grappling for clues . Desperate for answers . Neighbor pitted against neighbor in suspicion and fear . We are momentarily stirred by the drama of his speech , but he is voicing sentiments of weeks ago . A belated coda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem : no finger on the pulse . He 's slow to evaluate , even slower to act . We resent his jowly , bow-tied demeanor . He proposes a monument in the square , a small gas torch that will stay lit , eternally vigilant , until the women return . Donations trickle in , guiltily . <p> From this , the newspaper enjoys a brief second wind of missing women coverage . After the press conference , there are additional quotes to be gleaned from the mayor , the locally available friends and family of the missing , and the major contributors to the gas torch . There is even a statement from the fire marshal attesting to the relative safety of the proposed monument . The newspaper 's cartoonist , known for her acid social commentary , draws bums and bag ladies toasting skewered rats over the torch 's flame-to call attention to the downtown homeless . This is generally derided as tasteless , and the editor prints what amounts to an apology under coRRECTIoNs , saying the paper " regrets the error . " The cartoonist resigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her settlement to the torch fund , part to the soup kitchen . There will be other occasional flare-ups . Adelle 's parents will reemerge woefully from time to time , but in retrospect we will see that it was here the story 's last traces turned to ash . <p> And what of the missing women ? They do turn up , but only in dreams . We 're at a party , and though the dream seems intended only to air private anxieties ( we find ourselves naked in a room full of people ) , there are the three of them , lingering over the bean dip . Or we walk into an alcove filled with light to see Adelle in her wedding dress , spinning , spinning , her face aging with each rotation , the smile lined and straining , G forces undulating her cheeks . Or from the reception area of her beauty shop we watch Kay cutting hair that drops in soft heaps , the yellow-blond hair of her daughter , black at the root . Or the girls are wearing graduation caps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but maps of their whereabouts . They offer us a peek , but when we lean in to look , they pull away , snickering with teenage disdain , and vanish . Or , in the one we do n't speak of , we are running down a familiar forest path , hunted , and we sense them beneath the pads of our feet , planted deep in the dark , green woods , bones cooling , and we wake , knowing they 've been here all along . <p>
