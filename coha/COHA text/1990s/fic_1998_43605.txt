Gina had all the symptoms : sleep disturbances , hot flashes , irritability , weight gain , loss of libido , aching joints , and heart palpitations . The one she complained of most was hot flashes , which she dealt with by throwing off her clothes and cursing . As far as Evan was concerned , her irritability was the worst symptom ; she was increasingly difficult to get along with . Churlish , he told her . Her lack of interest in sex was possibly more frustrating , though he admitted to himself that he found her less desirable because she was so uncivil , so he did not suffer unduly from wanting her and being rejected . When they did make love , it was a wrestling match , which Evan enjoyed well enough . They had never been much for tender embraces . <p> Her work was changing , too ; it was getting darker . As he stood looking at an engraving of trees , of a dark forest , he wondered how it could all seem so clear when it was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well into the nights , because she could n't sleep . Often enough he found her in the mornings curled up under a lap rug on the cot in her cluttered , inky little studio with the windows open and the chill early morning light pouring in . <p> She was n't taking care of herself properly , not eating enough , not washing enough , she hardly took any exercise at all . Sometimes she lay around the living room all day , napping or reading magazines , getting up now and then to rummage around in her studio , then back to the couch , where she left ink stains on the upholstery . There were dustballs under the beds and in the corners of the rooms , dishes always stacked in the sink . <p> " It 's driving me crazy , " Evan complained . " Ca n't we get someone in to clean this place , since you ca n't keep up with it ? " <p> She gave him a cold , reproachful glare over her magazine . " I can keep up with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with it . " <p> " Well , then , hire someone who will . " <p> " You hire someone , " she replied . " Since it bothers you so much . " <p> Evan turned away . He did all the cooking as it was . How could he possibly take on the cleaning as well ? And he had no idea how to hire someone . He went to the kitchen and threw open the refrigerator . " And what are we going to eat for dinner ? " he shouted to her . " This refrigerator is practically empty . " <p> " We 'll go out , " she shouted back . <p> They went out . She was in a good mood for a change . They laughed , drank too much wine , walked back through the city streets with their arms locked around each other , made love on the living room floor . Evan went to bed but she would n't go with him . She went to her studio , and twice when he woke in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next day she was a harridan again , peevish and distracted . His own work was going poorly , he had taken on too much and had two deadlines he did n't think he could make . When he complained to her , she shrugged . " Then do n't make them , " she said . " Tell the editor you ca n't do it . " <p> " Right , " he said . " And then she never calls on me again . I need the work " <p> " You always say that , " she snapped . " And you always have more work than you can do . So , obviously you do n't need it . " <p> Evan followed her out of the room into her studio . " I do n't always have more than I can do . Sometimes I do n't have any . It 's feast or famine in this business , as you well know . " <p> Gina yawned , put her hands on her hips , and stretched , making an agonized face at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> " It 's freezing in here , " he said , moving toward the open window . " Why do n't you close this ? " <p> But before he could reach it she blocked his path . " Do n't close the window , " she said angrily . <p> " Ugh , " Evan said . " What is that ? " For on the windowsill were the remains of some animal . Evan pushed past his wife to get a closer look . It was the back half of a mouse , tail , feet , gory innards . <p> " Where did this come from ? " he said . " The cat must have left it . " She turned away , bending over a partially engraved plate . <p> " We do n't have a cat . " <p> All at once she was angry , as if he 'd done something annoying . <p> " The neighbor 's cat , " she sputtered . " Would you just leave it . I 'll take care of it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the room at the half-empty coffee cups , the dishes with crumbs and bits of old sandwiches or dried cottage cheese stuck to them , the confusion of ink and paper , copper plates , presses , the disorder of the bottles of acids and resins , the writing desk overflowing with unanswered mail , bills , and photographs . " This whole room is disgusting , " he concluded . " How can you find anything in here ? " <p> To which she replied , " Who asked you to come in here ? Will you get out of here ? " And she pushed him out the door . <p> They were invited to a dinner party . Gina was in her studio until it was almost time to leave . Then she came out , washed her hands , combed her hair , threw on a skirt , and said she was ready . Evan had showered , shaved , dressed carefully , even polished his shoes . He looked at her skeptically . " That 's it ? " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> No jewelry , he thought . No makeup , no perfume . There had been a time when it took her at least an hour to dress for a party . <p> The party went well , it was easy conversation , good wine , old friends , until a couple Gina and Evan had not seen for some time arrived . Evan spotted the woman , Vicky , first , smiled and waved as he caught her eye . Something was different about her , he thought , but he could n't be sure . She looked great , very bright , very intense . Her blouse had flecks of gold in it ; she was sparkling . Gina , standing next to him , laughing at something their host was saying , turned and saw the woman , too . " Oh my God , " she said softly . Vicky moved slowly toward them , smiling . <p> Seeing Gina 's drop-jawed amazement , the host said confidentially , " She 's been done . " Evan sent him an inquiring look , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of his fingers . <p> Vicky had stopped to speak to someone else . Evan watched her , though he tried not to stare . In a distant , agreeable way he had always admired her . The last time he had seen her , several months ago , he had observed that her delicate beauty was fading . Now she looked good , he thought . She 'd changed her hair , too , probably to disguise the more surprising change in her face . They 'd done a good job on her . Perhaps her mouth was a little stretched at the corners , and of course the flesh around her chin looked tight . She broke away from her conversation and continued toward Gina and Evan . <p> " Vicky , how are you ? " Evan said , catching her outstretched hand in his own , as if he were retrieving her , he thought , or pulling her out of a fish tank . " It 's good to see you . " <p> He was aware of Gina at his side , of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face until it was too late . " Have you lost your mind ? " she said sharply to Vicky . " Why would you do something like that ? You look awful . " <p> Vicky missed a beat to astonishment and another to dismay , but that was all . " I may have lost my mind , " she said , " but you seem to have lost your manners . " <p> Evan turned on his wife . He was so angry he wanted to slap her . " For God 's sake , Gina , " he said . " Are you drunk ? " Gina blinked her eyes rapidly , ignoring him . She was concentrated on Vicky , who was easing herself away . " So you count on people not to say anything . Do you tell yourself they do n't notice ? " <p> " Excuse me , " Vicky said , disappearing into the crowd . " It 's ridiculous , " Gina continued . " She looked perfectly fine before . Now she looks like something from television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 'd better go , " Evan said , trying to take her arm , but she shook him off . <p> " Will you calm down , " she said . <p> So they stayed and the rest of the evening passed uneventfully , but Evan was miserable and felt humiliated . At dinner they were seated as far from Vicky and her husband as possible , probably at her request , Evan thought . Vicky was the center of attention ; Evan could hear her tinkling laugh , but could n't bring himself to look her way . Gina leaned out past him now and then to shoot a disapproving look toward the offending jawline , but she said nothing more about it , and once she got into a conversation with her neighbor , which Evan joined , she seemed to forget the unpleasant incident . They talked about publishing , the neighbor was also a journalist , and then about travel . Gina told a funny story about a hotel they had stayed in on a Greek island , and Evan , though he had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the porter threw Gina 's suitcase out the window , found himself laughing as heartily as their friend . He applied himself to his wine and resolved to forgive his wife . <p> Evan noticed the book a few times before he actually picked it up to look at it . He 'd seen it on the table in the living room , half buried in a pile of magazines , and on the kitchen table , and once on the nightstand next to their bed . A woman 's book about women , he thought , about all the trials of their biology and psychology , the special wonderfulness of it all and the failure of men to comprehend any of it , though it was going on right under their noses . Women lapped this stuff up like cream , even intelligent women like Gina , which was what really made it annoying . Here was the book again , jammed between the cushions of the couch with a pencil stuck in it to mark the page . He pulled it out and opened it to the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longer a Woman , " and it told all about the biological changes attendant on the menopause , the shrinking of the uterus , the drying out of vaginal tissue , the atrophy of the ovaries , the steady depletion of estrogen . Pretty dry reading , Evan thought with a sardonic chuckle . He put the book back where he had found it and wandered off to his desk , where his article was not taking shape . No longer a woman , he thought . But if not a woman , then what ? It was ridiculous . When was a woman ever not a woman ? All the symptoms Gina complained of only proved she was a woman , and a susceptible one at that , which was part of being a woman , too . An old woman was still a woman , still behaved as she always had , only more so . Evan thought of his grandmother . Not an old woman but an old lady . She wore violet perfume , he could still remember it , and was fond of a certain candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tins ; he had n't seen any in years . She was small , bent , arthritic , but industrious to the end . She did a little gardening on the last day of her life . She had survived her husband by twenty years . Perfectly nice , perfectly sexless . Serene , agreeable . Everyone loved her . <p> Though he remembered that once , when he was praising this wonderful woman to his mother , she had commented drily , " Yes , she 's very nice now . But she was n't always . " <p> Their son , Edward , called . Gina answered the phone . Evan stood by waiting for his turn ; he was fond of his son and looked forward to these weekly calls . Gina was smiling . She laughed at some witticism and said , " Watch out for that . " Then for several minutes she fell silent . Her eyes wandered around the room , never settling , and she shifted her weight from foot to foot restlessly . At last she said , distantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . I 'll talk to you next week , " and held out the phone to Evan . <p> While he stood talking to Edward , Gina sat down at the table and pulled off her sweater . Then , as Edward went on about his psychology class , she stripped off her shirt and bra . She stretched her arms out across the table and rested her head upon them . Evan turned away from her and tried to concentrate on his son 's description of his daily life . When he hung up the phone she was sitting up , blotting her forehead with her sweater . <p> " You were a little abrupt with him , " Evan said . " He asked if you were okay . " <p> " Of course I 'm okay , " she said . <p> Evan took a seat next to her and watched as she pulled her shirt back over her head . " Did he tell you about his psychology professor ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . " He talks too much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to stroke down his impatience . " You 're not the only one who 's getting older , you know . " <p> She pushed back her chair , dismissing him . She was on her way to her studio . " It 's not the same , " she said in parting . " It 's different . " <p> It was always different , he thought . They wanted to be treated the same , but only with the understanding that they deserved special treatment because they were different . It was true that they had been treated as if they were different for a long time , but they had been treated as different in the wrong way , they were not different in that way . What was different was the deal they got , the way they were treated , which was never fair . He loosened his collar ; his face felt hot . But oh no , it was n't anything that was n't his fault . It was n't hormones surging uncontrollably like guerilla fighters , it was just his lousy blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suffering , and if he was uncomfortable , if he felt a little snappish , well , it was all his fault , because her bad temper was a symptom , and his was just plain old gardenvariety bad temper , typical in the male . He got up and staggered into his study , where his article accosted him , demanding what he could not , because of Gina , seem to give it : his undivided attention . He turned away and went into the kitchen to make coffee . <p> Gina had gone out to have lunch with a friend . Evan was alone in the apartment with his article . He sat at his desk reading over his notes , listening to the taped interview he had done with a teenaged girl who , he recalled , had been dressed in something that resembled two pieces of bicycle tubing . It depressed him to listen to her agitated , rage-filled monologue . She had a vocabulary of twenty-five words or so , insufficient to express any but the most basic threats and complaints . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan 's article was about these girls , the attendants of brutal young men , about their precarious , angry , voluptuous , and mindless daily lives . On the tape she was trying to explain to Evan that she did not get up at the same time every day , which was why school was not a possibility for her . <p> He switched off the tape machine and stared at his bright computer screen for several minutes , but nothing came to him so he switched that off , too . Then he got up and wandered through the apartment to Gina 's studio . <p> The lunch was a kind of celebration ; she 'd finished all the work scheduled for a show next month . There were two new engravings on the drying rack , the rest were stacked away in two big portfolios , ready to go . As Evan stood looking at one on the rack , a line from one of her catalogues ran through his head : " She is a woman who has never stopped loving the forest . " They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she is a woman who has never stopped living in Brooklyn . " <p> For twenty years her subject had been the same , but this did n't mean her work had not changed . In Evan 's opinion the change had been gradual and persistent . She was more patient , saw more clearly , though the prints were progressively darker . That was the odd , wonderful thing about the newer prints ; though they seemed to be covered with ink they were full of an odd kind of light , an almost subterranean glow . In this one , for instance , he could see through a tangle of vegetation to the ground beneath , and on that dark ground he could make out the tracks of some small animal , a mouse or a chipmunk . In both the prints on the rack , the viewpoint was high , as if the viewer were above it all , in a tree perhaps , looking down . Evan studied the second one . He seemed to be falling into it ; it was truly an exhilarating angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of lines , he made out something extraordinary . He crouched down , close to the paper . It was the small hind foot of a rabbit , no bigger than his fingernail , but perfectly clear . In the next second , he knew , it would be gone . <p> He went to the portfolio , opened it , looked at the first print . Again the odd feeling of vertigo seized him as he looked down upon the teeming world of branches and vines . He could almost hear the dull buzz of insect life , breathe the oxygen-laden air . " These are terrific ; ' he said aloud . No wonder she had been so absorbed , so distracted , so uninterested in the daily course of her life . He felt a little stab of jealousy . His own work did not claim him ; he had to drag himself to it . But that feeling passed quickly . He sat down on her cot , flushing with excitement , imagining how the room would look filled with his wife 's strange vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footsteps in the hall , then she was standing in the doorway looking in at him . <p> " What are you doing in here ? " she said , just an edge of territorial challenge in her tone . <p> " I was looking at the new work ; ' he said . <p> She leaned against the doorframe , pushed her hair off her forehead . She 'd had a few drinks at lunch , celebrating . " Well , what do you think ? " she said . <p> " I think it 's just amazing ; " he said . " It 's so good I had to sit down here and mull it over . " <p> She sagged a little more in the doorway , smiling now but anxious . " Do you really think so ? I 've been almost afraid for you to see it . " <p> " Oh , my dear , " he said . <p> Tears filled her eyes . She brushed them away with the back of one hand . " I 'm so happy ; ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , still wiping away tears . " These stupid tears ; ' she said impatiently . <p> Evan put his arm around her , muttered into her shoulder , " I 'm so proud of you . " There they sat for some time , contented , holding on to one another as if they were actually in the forest of her dreams . <p> There was always a letdown after she 'd finished a block of work , Evan told himself in the difficult days that followed . She was petulant and weepy , angry with the gallery owner , who had been her friend and supporter for years , complaining about every detail of the installation . She hardly slept at night , though what she did in her studio Evan could n't figure out . She was n't working and she had n't , as she usually did between showings , cleaned the place up . But night after night he woke just long enough to watch her get up , pull on her robe , and go out , then he saw the light from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , napping or reading , getting nothing done and snapping at him if he so much as suggested a trip to the grocery . He tried to ignore her , spent his days struggling with his article , which resisted his efforts so stubbornly he sometimes sat at his desk for hours , literally pulling at what he called the remains of his hair . Finally he began to have trouble sleeping , too . He lay on his back in the darkness while panic gripped his heart , unable to move or to rest . When he did sleep , he had strange , unsettling dreams in which he was lost , pursued by something terrifying , powerful , something silent and brooding , something with wings . <p> One night , waking in terror from such a dream , he found himself , as he often did , alone in the bed . Once his heart slowed down and strength returned to his legs , he resolved to get up . His throat was parched , he felt dehydrated , as if he had been wandering in a desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and fumbled around for his slippers . Some desert creature ? A creature with claws and wings and the face of a woman who would pose some unanswerable riddle before tearing him to bits ? The idea amused him as he stumbled to the kitchen and switched on the lights , which made him recoil so violently he switched them back off . He poured himself a glass of water , and stood , still sleep-shocked , gazing out the kitchen window at the back of the building across the alley . Above it he could see the milky luminescence of the half-moon . He finished his water , feeling quiet now , and friendly . <p> The light from Gina 's studio made a pool across the kitchen floor . He put his glass in the sink and followed this light to her room . The double doors had glass insets , but the glass was mottled so as not to be transparent . They were closed , but not tightly-in fact one stood free of the latch and could be opened noiselessly with a push . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep he did n't want to wake her , either . " Gina ? " he said softly once , then again . Carefully he pushed the door open a few inches . He could see the cot from where he was ; she was n't in it . He opened the door a little farther , then all the way . The window stood open , the room was bright and cold ; Gina was not in it . <p> It took him a moment to apprehend this information . He looked around anxiously , as if he could make her materialize by his determination to find her there . He went to the living room , perhaps she was sleeping on the couch ; he looked in the bathroom and then the bedroom , though , of course , he knew she was not there . He glanced at the clock , three a.m . He went back to the studio . <p> What did it mean ? How often in the past months , when he had believed her to be here in this room had she been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chest , he laid his hand upon it . She had a lover , there could be no doubt of it . That was why she was so tired all the time , why she slept all day , and why she was so cold and bitter . <p> Evan switched off the light and went to sit on the couch in the living room in the dark . He would wait for her ; they would have it out . His rival was probably much younger than he was . When women Gina 's age could , they often did . He thought of Colette and George Eliot . He would be a young man impressed by her because she was an artist and he was , surely , a nothing , a boy in need of a mother . It went like that ; there were countless such stories . The minutes ticked by . He waited in a fog of anxiety and weariness . He was n't up to the scene to come . Perhaps he should get back in bed and pretend he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would tire of the young man , or he of her , and things would get back to normal . <p> He was awakened by a clatter coming from Gina 's studio . It sounded like someone was smashing china . He leaped to his feet , crossed the narrow hall , and threw open the doors . The early morning light was soft and pale , bathing the scene before him in a wash of pink and gray . Gina was on her hands and knees on the floor just inside the window . Next to her was a broken plate . A few crusts had flown from it and landed near her foot . One was lodged in the cuff of her pants . <p> " What on earth are you doing ? " he cried . <p> She sat up , rubbing her ankle , picking out the bit of bread . " What does it look like I 'm doing ? " she said crossly . " I 'm trying to get up off the floor . " <p> " But where have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head toward the window . " I was on the fire escape . <p> She could n't have come in the door , Evan reasoned . She would have had to walk through the living room and he would have seen her . " What were you doing out there ? " he complained . " Did n't you hear me call you ? " <p> " No , " she said . " I guess I fell asleep . " She got to her feet , brushing herself off . Evan pushed past her and stuck his head out the window . " How could you sleep out here ? " he called back to her . In the summer she kept plants on the landing , herbs and geraniums , and on hot nights she sometimes took a cushion and sat among the pots . But now there was nothing but the cold metal , the cold air , and the cold stars fading overhead in a pale sky . The stairs led down to a narrow alleyway , which opened into a school parking lot that was fenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there . His eye was caught by something on the landing below . It was a long brown feather with a black bar across it . He turned from the window to his wife , who was sitting on the cot , her head in her hands . <p> " You do n't expect me to believe that , " he said . <p> She raised her head and gave him a brief weary inspection , as if she were looking at an annoying insect . " I do n't care what you believe , " she said . <p> " Gina , what 's happening to you ? " he exclaimed . " You disappear in the middle of the night , you tell me an absurd lie nobody would believe , and then you give me your too-tired-to-care routine . " <p> " I 'm not tired , " she said . " I just do n't care . " <p> " We ca n't go on like this , " he said , in despair . <p> " I know it , " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , could they do ? He accepted her story , partly because he could n't come up with an alternative scenario-she had been coming in through the window , and the fire escape , as she pointed out , led nowhere-and partly because it did n't seem to matter . He did n't think she was having an affair because she did n't act like someone who was in love ; she was neither defensive nor elated , and she seemed completely uninterested in her own body . What he had often thought of as a brooding sensuality now became just brooding . He continued his struggle with his article , Gina battled it out with her gallery , and finally they were both finished and both were moderately successful . They had a little time to rest , to cast about for new projects . Usually when this happened they gave themselves over to the pleasure of having no deadlines , sleeping late , eating at odd hours , gorging on videos , food , and sex . But this time it was different . Gina was still sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sex Evan made a resolution that he would not initiate it . In the past , he thought gloomily , he had never paid much attention to who started it . Now he was selfconsciously aware that it was always him . She rejected him without speaking , with a shrug , or by walking away . And if she did accept his overtures , she hurried him along , as if she did n't really have the time and her mind was somewhere else . He grew sick of trying and sick of waiting . Winter was dragging on ; the weather was rotten , cold and rainy . <p> Evan was drinking too much , and for the first time in his life he began to put on weight . One Sunday when the sun was shining for a change and there was a hint of warmth in the air , he ran into a neighbor at the farmers ' market . During their conversation Evan jokingly mentioned the latter problem ; the drinking was a secret he was keeping even from himself . <p> " It happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Especially at our age . I 've joined a gym ; it 's not far from here . It 's made a big difference in how I feel . " <p> Evan had to admit that his neighbor looked fit and energetic . " Give me a call , " the neighbor concluded . " I go two or three times a week . I 'll take you over and show you around . Bring Gina , if she 's interested . " <p> But of course she was n't interested . " It 's ridiculous , " she said , throwing one magazine on the floor and taking up another . " I 'm not going to spend my time running on a treadmill like a laboratory rat . " <p> So Evan went alone . He met his friend at the reception desk and received a pass , then a tour of the facility . He was impressed with the size of the place , the up-to-date equipment , swimming pool , racquetball courts-he had n't played in years but he remembered enjoying the game-there was even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , as he was leaving , that he found Vicky and her husband , who waved him over to their table with soft cries of enthusiasm and surprise . As he walked to join them , Evan experienced a mild pang of discomfort ; he had n't seen either of them since Gina had behaved so rudely at the party . But Vicky seemed not to remember , or not to care . Her hand pressed his warmly in greeting and she patted the chair next her , inviting him to sit . <p> " So you 're thinking of joining up ? " her husband , Victor , inquired . <p> Evan smiled at him and nodded , looking around the pleasant , busy room . He was thinking , as he always did when he saw them together , Vicky and Victor , such silly names . " It 's much bigger than I thought it would be , " he said . <p> Vicky drained her carrot juice . " We 've been coming for a year now . It 's a lifesaver . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . She was wearing a sleeveless scoop-neck leotard and leggings so he could see exactly how good she looked . There was just a hint of cleavage visible at the neckline , enough to show that her breasts were still firm , not sallow-looking or wrinkled . Her arms looked firm and strong , too , though the thick cords and darkened skin on the backs of her hands gave some hint of her age . She had a scarf tied around her waist , not the best idea , Evan thought , because it called attention to the small but distinctly round belly just below . He could n't see her hips . She pushed her hair back from her face , giving Evan a quick , complex look made up in parts of gratitude , flirtation , and suspicion . " Thanks , " she said . " I feel great . " <p> Victor patted her shoulder proprietarily . " She 's fantastic , " he said . Vicky laughed , childishly pleased to be the object of her husband 's praise . Evan looked down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of work , " he said . " It may be too late for me . " <p> " Never too late , " Victor assured him . " You 're as young as you feel " <p> Evan wished they could talk about something else , but there was no way to change the subject . This was a gym , after all . The subject was bodies . Victor told Evan about his routine . He liked the stair-step machine , Vicky preferred the treadmill . The aerobic classes were excellent . Vicky even did yoga . The free-weights room was sometimes a little crowded ; the young jocks did not always leave the racks in perfect order , that was the only drawback . At last there was a lull long enough for Evan to make an excuse . He had to get back to work , he said . As always , he had a deadline . <p> " Time for us to hit the showers , " Victor said , getting up . He popped Vicky playfully across the shoulders with his towel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan 's hand . " Give Gina our best . " <p> Evan noted the brief flash of distress that crossed Vicky 's face at the mention of his wife . She remembers perfectly well , he thought . She 's just being nice about it . Then he was angry at Gina all over again . What right had she to criticize this nice woman because she cared enough about her appearance to have her face lifted ? What was wrong with staying fit and wanting to look good for each other , as Vicky and Victor obviously did ? <p> Evan left the gym with a printed sheet of membership privileges and prices gripped tightly in his hand . Filled with resolution and optimism , he stopped in the chilly parking lot to look it over . This was a good thing to do , he told himself . He wanted to be like Vicky and Victor . Gina would ridicule him but he did n't care . He wanted to feel good about himself , he wanted to change his life . Carefully he folded his informational paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night Gina was particularly restless and distracted . Evan made pasta and a salad for dinner but she hardly touched it . She complained that her neck and shoulders were stiff , shrugging repeatedly , trying to loosen up the muscles . Evan told her about the gym , expecting a tirade , or simply a dismissive remark , but to his surprise she listened attentively . In fact , as he explained why he thought it would be a good investment for him , how he feared that his sedentary ways resulted in fatigue and depression , she seemed to focus on him with a distant but sincere interest . " It ca n't be good for you to be closed up in here with me all the time , " she said . <p> " It 's not that , " he protested . <p> She said nothing . Evan chewed a piece of lettuce . He could feel her eyes on his face . At last he looked up at her , expecting to find contempt , or anger , or indifference , but she was studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity or self-interest , as if , he thought , she were looking right into his soul and finding it blameless , but also infinitely sad . He felt a hot flush rising to his cheeks and he looked away , at his fork resting among the salad greens , at his half-full glass of wine . <p> " I think it 's a good idea , " she said . <p> They sat together on the couch watching a video . It was a complicated story of intrigue on a Greek island . Evan had chosen it because the cover showed a man standing in front of a white building set against a sky so blue and so clearly warm he wished he was in the picture . The scenery in the film was terrific ; the television screen seemed to pour warmth and color into their drab living room . When it was over Evan talked a little about how much he wanted to travel , to go to Greece again , and also to Italy and Spain , warm sunny countries where the people were relaxed and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with care and enthusiasm . Now that their son was grown they could think about going off-season , when there were no tourists . Gina listened , inserting qualifiers here and there-the food in Spain was notoriously filthy , the Italians were far from relaxed-but she seemed more amused than irritated by his aimless fantasies . " You 're full of desires today , " she said . <p> " It 's true , " he admitted . " I am . " He rubbed his hand along her thigh , nuzzled his face against her shoulder . She neither responded nor pushed him away . He brought his hand up to her breast , took her earlobe gently between his teeth . " Please do n't , " she said softly . <p> He dropped back on the couch , letting out a sigh of frustration . <p> " I 'm sorry , " she said , getting up . <p> " Do n't worry about it , " he said . <p> She went into her studio and began gathering up dishes , wadding up pieces of paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where he sat . She went into the kitchen carrying plates , came back with a garbage bag . Evan looked at the clock ; it was after midnight . A great time for a little light cleaning , he thought . " A little night cleaning , " he called to her . <p> " I ca n't stand it anymore , " she said , amiably . <p> " Me neither , " Evan said , but softly , to himself . She did n't hear it . After a few minutes he realized he was falling asleep . He got up , pulling off his clothes as he went to bed . <p> The dream ended , as he had known it must , with his missing the plane . Evan woke feeling breathless . He had been running , but they kept the planes across a busy six-lane highway from the check-in . There was a fence , too , he recalled , chain-link , tall , over six feet . He rolled onto his side and looked at the clock . It was five a.m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up , rubbing his head , disoriented and strangely apprehensive . After a few moments he got up and made his way to the kitchen . While he stood at the sink drinking water , it dawned on him that the lights in Gina 's studio were off . She must have decided to sleep in there . Usually when he found her asleep , the lights were on , the book she had been reading had slipped to the floor or lay , still open , beneath her hand . He stepped out into the hall . <p> The day was just beginning to dawn and there was enough gray light for him to see his way . It was , he thought , the most beautiful time of day . The air was still , the building all around him wrapped in a nearly palpable silence , yet alive with the impending and inevitable intensification of light . It was warm in the hall ; the apartment was overheated and there was no way to adjust it . A blast of cool air greeted him as he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the other . <p> She had left both the doors and windows wide open . The room was in perfect order , down to the pencils . Some of the habitual clutter had even been stored away in boxes , which were stacked against one wall . The cot was made up neatly : Gina was not in it . Nor was she anywhere else in the room . He said her name once , turned and looked out into the living room , but of course she was n't there , either . He crossed the orderly studio-it seemed alien yet familiar to him , like a room in a dream-to look out on the fire escape , which he found , as he expected , unoccupied . Why was this happening ? he thought . Why could n't everything just go on as it always had ? He gazed up at the pale sky , down at the iron clutter of the fire escape , across the narrow ugly yard at the opposite building . He felt an ineffable sadness curling up into his consciousness like a twining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one was up yet . One narrow window had a light on , probably a bathroom light left on all night . <p> He had the uncanny feeling that he was being watched . An abrupt snapping sound drew his eyes up to the ledge at the top , just one story above his own . <p> That was when he saw the owl . <p> His sadness was dissipated by this wondrous sight . He leaned out the window , craning his neck to see more clearly . " Wow , " he said . " An owl in Brooklyn . " <p> A big owl , too , or so it seemed to him . He reflected that he had never actually seen an owl before , at least not at such close range . The bird was perfectly still but its head was inclined forward , its golden eyes were focused on Evan . Then , to his astonishment , with a sudden convulsion of motion that was as soundless as it was alarming , the owl opened its wings and flew directly at him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second . Evan reeled away from the window , aware only of fierce talons extended in his direction . In the next moment he stood clutching the edge of Gina 's drawing table , and the owl was perched comfortably on the window ledge , not ten feet away . <p> His momentary terror faded , replaced by fascination and wonder . The bird was evidently not going to attack him . There was a raised metal bar along the sill , part of the fire escape , and the owl had wrapped its feet around this . He could see the talons sticking out beneath the thick brown fluff of the legs , black and long and sharp as a cat 's daws . The bill , too , looked sharp and dangerous , like a hard black finger pointing down between the large golden eyes . These eyes were fixed on Evan 's face with unblinking , unnerving directness . They seemed to be looking right through him , possibly at something behind him . He shifted uneasily from one foot to the other . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 're fresh out of mice . " <p> The bird opened its beak , as if to speak , then spun its head around to face the courtyard , where some tiny motion or sound , invisible or inaudible to Evan , attracted its attention . The whole maneuver was so sudden he had only an impression of having seen it , but it seemed to him the bird 's head went all the way around . The eyes drilled through him again . What a disturbing thing it was to be scrutinized in this way by a creature who had , he knew , no sympathy with him . Again the owl opened its beak , but this time a sound issued forth , a high-pitched , startling scream , such as a frightened woman might make . It was so loud and sudden it made Evan step back . Then , as suddenly , the bird was silent again . " Please ; ' Evan said . " You 'll wake the neighbors . " The owl , unconcerned , fell to picking at its chest feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the bird did n't know with each second exactly where he was . He was so close he could have reached out to touch the beautiful mottled wings , though he knew he would not dare . The owl raised its strange , otherworldly face , made a calm sidestep on the bar , dipped its head , then refocused on his face . <p> " Why have you come here ? " Evan asked . <p> But the owl only stared at him and he felt foolish for speaking . With the intrusion of this portentous creature , all the tedium and anxiety of his life had fallen away . A thrill , as of discovery , passed through him , but he did not move . It was best to be still in such a presence , which surely would not stay long or ever come again . <p>
