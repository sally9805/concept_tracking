Car salesmen call it sticker shock : A customer comes in , swoons over a spiffy new sports car , sees the price tag , reels in disbelief , sweats and grows dizzy , and finally ask about what 's available on the used lot . I experienced a form of sticker shock this summer when I started seeing ski areas announce ' ' 94- ' ' 95 daily lift ticket prices as high as $41 . Forty-seven clams ! Sweat and dizziness . Then bad memories from last winter started coming back to me : the $140 chain-motel room ... the $8 salad for lunch ... I could feel sticker shook buzzing through my toenails . TIX FOR LESS ... OR FREE So what 's a skier to do ? If you 're a cheapskate like me , the first thing you do is start sniffing around for freebies , then smoke out the real freebies from the pretenders . When the smoke clears , the one true $0 lift ticket is the one offered by Crested Butte ( 800-SKI-FREE ) from Thanksgiving to the week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer free skiing . Telluride ( 800-525-3455 ) , for example , is advertising an early- and late-season ( November 23-December 16 ; April 1-9 ) " ski free " program , but to get free tickets , you must stay at a property represented by Telluride Resort Accommodations . This still is n't a bad deal , since prices start at $45 per night per person for a condo ( four-person occupancy ) , $52.50 for a hotel room ( double occupancy ) , and $67.50 for a bed and breakfast ( double occupancy ) ; but compare that with the $99-per-person package at Crested Butte , which includes three nights lodging in a three-bedroom condo ( six-person occupancy ) or the $321 for two people for four nights at the Mountainlair Hotel ( that 's $40 a night , per person ) . And Crested Butte offers unlimited free beginner lessons to never-evers age seven and older . Of course if you 're a true cheapskate , you could stay in your car at Crested Butte , since the tickets are absolutely free  --  no lodging tie-ins , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But some other resorts are also dangling this kind of some-strings-attached freebie . With Park City 's ( 800-222-7275 ) free-skiing offer , you have to stay a minimum of four nights at prices that are similar to Telluride 's . If you ca n't get tickets for free , there are plenty of ways to buy tickets for less than full retail . One is through the frequent-skier programs offered by many areas . One of the first  --  and still one of the best  --  deals is Stratton 's Frequent Skier Card ( 8OO-THE-MTNS ) . For $25 , you get a card that entitles you to $10 off the standard lift ticket price every day except holidays , $17 off early and late season tickets , and , after 10 uses , $17 off midweek tickets . You can also use the card for discounts on multiple-day tickets . Some frequent-skier programs offer more than just ticket discounts . Heavenly Ski Resort 's Heavenly Ski Club ( 800-2HEAVEN ) , which costs $25 to join , gives members a 30 percent discount on group lessons , 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals . Members also get $9 off lift tickets when they enter the resort from the Nevada side . Other ticket discounts abound , from midweek two-for-one deals to various coupon programs , usually offered through supermarkets , gas stations , and ski shops . For example , in the Northeast , you can get a coupon that will save you $10 on an adult full-day ticket or $3 on a junior ticket at Whiteface , Sugarbush , Sugarloaf , Waterville Valley , or Jiminy Peak by filling up a total of three times at any of 1,400 participating Mobil stations . The discount is good Sunday to Friday , excluding holidays . The coupon can also be turned in for a $10 discount on lodging . Another good value in lift tickets is cross-country skiing . Yes , it 's slightly more work than downhill , but there are never any lift lines or crowds , and the price ca n't be beat  --  usually less than 20 bucks for the use of a trail system , or even no bucks at all . One true freebie I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nordic Council . The network , one of the best in the country , includes close to 80 kilometers of groomed trails . That 's not a deal , it 's a steal . A GREENER DOLLAR For things that ai n't free , I 'm leaving the country . At last look , the Canadian dollar was trading at about 72 cents to the U.S. dollar . Almost a 30 percent discount , right up front . The daily lift ticket at Lake Louise ( 403-256-8473 ) is $39.50 , right ? Nooooo ! Make that a little over 28 bucks with the currency exchange . Last spring , on a trip to Whistler/ Blackcomb ( 800-WHISTLER ) , a friend of mine and I had a five-course dinner at La Rua  --  " Whistler 's most expensive restaurant , " as one local described it . The bill  --  including tip , tax , and much too much wine , came to $90 . But nooooo ! I get my American Express bill , and the total cost is $66 U.S. Thirty dollars a day for my Thrifty rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . I love that country . I also love Europe , and  --  thanks to airlines engaging in fare-war price-slashing  --  I can almost afford it . These days , with more U.S. carriers competing in Euro-travel , the transatlantic arena is a major fare-war battleground , and winter is the Euro-travel off-season . So I 'm anticipating fares even better this winter than last , when I noticed round-trip prices of under $500 for flights between New York and Geneva . Once in Europe , deals abound , especially in France , where the dollar has been holding its own against the French franc . A couple of winters ago , I joined a seven-day guided trip , offered by Skiez 12 Vallees , in the Savoy region of France , where the ' ' 92 Olympics were held . The price covered lodging , lift tickets , breakfast and dinner , transfers , guide service ( which , not incidentally , entitled us to cut lift lines ) , and the great scenery of the Alps . This winter , prices from Adventures on Skis ( 800-628-9655 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will range from $1,675 to $1,855 , de-pending on dates , including airfare from Boston , New York , or Washington . It 's also possible to find European ski-week packages that include airfare for around $1,000 . Those prices are still a big credit-card hit for die-hard cheapskates , but they 're great values , when you consider what you get for your money . SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL Back here in the States , the big kahunas of ski vacationing  --  Aspen , Killington , Park City , Stowe , Vail , etc.  --  insist that bigger is better ; pay more and you get more . To which I respond : maybe yes , maybe no . The big guys do have more cachet  --  more name value , more glamour , more fashionably attired skiers exercising the enviable power of limitless disposable income . But more skiing for your money ! Not ! " Little " resorts are the value kings , offering big-time skiing at small-potatoes prices . Among my favorites are Bridger Bowl ( 800-223-9609 ) in Montana , with over 2,000 vertical feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , with 3,100 verts and 2,300 acres ; and Grand Targhee ( 307-353-2300 ) in Wyoming , with 2,200 vertical feet and 2,500 skiable acres , plus another 1,500 accessible by snowcat . Bridger 's everyday ticket is $25 , Crystal 's ranges from $16 to $32 , Grand Targhee 's is $30 . And check out lodging rates : The most expensive hotel rooms in Bozeman ( near Bridger ) go for around $80 a night , and three-day/three-night packages can be had for as little as $130 per person . At Grand Targhee , you can get a five-night/four-day package for as low as $286 . Rates like that come along in big-kahuna country about as often as daffodils in January . RESPECTING THE ELDERS I also like ski areas with traditionalist streaks  --  e.g. , Alta ( 801-942-0404 ) , in Utah , and Mad River Glen ( 802-496-3551 ) , in Vermont  --  where old-time prices are not forgotten . One of my all-time favorite deals is the morning half-day ticket at Alta , which goes for 19 bucks . The ticket 's good from 9:15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1:30 , and morning is often when Alta's. famed snow is at its best . Stay in Salt Lake City ( 800-541-4955 ) , where you can scarf up a decent motel room for as little as $30 a night , and you end up with skiing and lodging for about the cost of a big-kahuna lift ticket . Also , get your ski rentals at shops in Salt Lake rather than at the resorts . Some city shops offer complete rental packages for under $6 a day . Mad River may claim the stinking-cheap deal of the century : the $120 midweek season pass . Ya got ta buy it before October 15 , and it 's not good during holiday periods , but a season pass for less than what a lot of resorts charge for a three-day ticket ? Maybe I wo n't leave the country . Mad River offers another ridiculously good bargain just for the student crowd : For $49 a day ( during January and after March 15 ) , you get lodging ( at the Inn at the Mad River Barn ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOOKY Midweek is cheapskate prime time , especially in New England and especially in New Hampshire . Take Attitah ( 800-223-SNOW ) , for example : Three-day/ three-night midweek packages that include lodging and lift tickets start at $188 . For more peripatetic skiers , there 's the five-consecutive-day , midweek New Hampshire Family Pass ( 800-887-5464 ) : $159 covers lift tickets for one parent and one child under 12 at any of 17 New Hampshire ski areas . Another region to find midweek bargains is the Northwest ; midweek tickets at places like Stevens Pass ( 206-973-2441 ) , in Washington , can be had for as little as $16 . There is a basic rule at work here . Ski areas ( such as those in New England and the Northwest ) that depend heavily on weekend business from nearby metropolitan areas are most likely to dish out midweek cheapies in an effort to drum up business . Conversely , Colorado resorts , most of which cater mainly to vacationers rather than weekenders , are less likely prospects for midweek deals . BETTER LATE THAN ... However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , bargains abound early ( December and before ) and late ( April and thereafter ) . I prefer late rather than early season  --  the days are longer and warmer , the snowpack is usually more substantial , and snow conditions can be surprisingly good . Last April I skied powder eight out of the 10 days that I spent at Keystone and Breckenridge . Maybe that 's why Keystone 's ( 800-222-0188 ) April deals  --  lift ticket and lodging starting at $59 a day , double occupancy  --  appeal to me . Park City 's " Toucan " program , featuring great deals on lodging and dining , is another star of the early- and late-season deals . You get three nights of lodging for the price of two at participating properties , as well as restaurant discounts ( November 18-December 15 and March 26-April 16 ) . FAMILY FINANCIALS Ski resorts put a lot of energy into trying to convince you and me that skiing is a " family sport . " Oh yeah ? When I start toting up the costs for , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think of skiing as an expensive sport for a family of one . Many resorts do offer free skiing and/or lodging for kids six and under , which helps , but what about skiers older than six ? Sun Valley 's ( 800-634-3347 ) " Kids Stay and Ski Free " program is the king of the kiddie deals : It applies to kids up to and including 17 years old ( though limited to one kid per parent ) , and is good November 24-December 17 ; January 3-February 4 ; and March 18 to closing . And Brighton ( 801-532-4731 ) in Utah offers free skiing for kids 10 and under any time of the year ( two children per paying adult ) . Okay  --  so far I have n't been talking much to you true skinflints out there . So let 's talk : I confess that I 'm now old and decadent enough to appreciate my own bathroom and a door to shut out the world at night , so hostels do n't really appeal to me . But " hostel " does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pillow fights and water balloons at 2 A.M. There are at least three hostels I can recommend heartily , with beds for about $20 or less a night : the Hostel at Jackson Hole ( 307733-3415 ) , the Snow Cap Inn Ski Dorm at Sunday River ( 800-543-2SKI ) , and the Round Hearth at Stowe ( 802-253-7223 ) . The accommodations are clean , the quiet hours are usually enforced , cheap meals may be included , and social activity  --  with a decided high-school and college flavor  --  is built-in . If you want a quick and easy way to meet other skiers of both sexes , stay in a hostel . At the Hostel , double rooms are $43 , quads $56 ( that 's $14 a night per person if you have four people ) . At the Round Hearth , $25 gets you a bed , breakfast , and dinner ; and at the Snow Cap last year , per-person rates were $22 midweek , $32 weekends . DEALS ON MEALS With that $8 salad threatening to ruin the middle of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of resorts , unconscionably , try to exclude brown-baggers from base lodges . Of course , some areas , such as Winter Park ( 800-729-5813 ) , have an enlightened , egalitarian attitude to ward brown-baggers , and Winter Park goes an egalitarian step further by offering a different daily lunch deal  --  entree , side dish , and drink for under $5 at three of their four largest on-mountain restaurants . Winter Park , by the way , is generally about the best of the major Colorado . resorts for finding bargains on lift tickets and lodging as well as meals . Speaking of eats , when I 'm looking for value ( rather than a flat-out cheapie ) , I look for " bar menus " at chichi restaurants . Sit at a table in the bar area and you can order ( usually from an abbreviated menu ) the same food being served in the main restaurant , at reduced prices and without chichi-restaurant pretensions . About the best I know of in this category is Isle de France ( 802-253-7751 ) in Stowe , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appetizers $3-$5 ) you can get a meal that would cost roughly twice as much in the main restaurant . Maybe not cheap , but not shockingly ski-town expensive , either . <p>
