Mickey Mantle , with his death Sunday at 63 , passes from these pages forever and becomes the property of anthropologists , people who can more properly put the calipers to celebrity , who can more accurately track the force of personality . We ca n't do it anymore , could n't really do it to begin with . He bat-led this , hit that . You can look it up . Hell , we do all the time . But there 's nothing in our library , in all those numbers , that explains how Mantle moves so smoothly from baseball history into national legend , a country 's touchstone , the lopsided grin on our society . // He was n't the greatest player who ever lived , not even of his time perhaps . He was a centerfielder of surprising swiftness , a switch-hitter of heart-stopping power , and he was given to spectacle : huge home runs ( his team , the New York Yankees , invented the tape-measure home run for him ) ; huge seasons ( .353 , 52 HRs , 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one World Series after another ( 12 in his first 14 seasons ) . Yet , for one reason or another , he never became Babe Ruth or Joe DiMaggio  --  or , arguably , even Willie Mays , his exact contemporary . // But for generations of men , he 's the guy , has been the guy , will be the guy . And what does that mean exactly ? A woman beseeches Mantle , who survived beyond his baseball career as a kind of corporate greeter , to make an appearance , to surprise her husband . Mantle materializes at some cocktail party , introductions are made , and the husband weeps in the presence of such fantasy made flesh . It means that , exactly . // It 's easy to account , at least partly , for the durability and depth of his fame : He played on baseball 's most famous team during the game 's final dominant era . From Mantle 's rookie season in 1951  --  the lead miner 's son signed out of Commerce , Okla. , for $1,100  --  to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preeminent game in the country . This was baseball B.C. ( Before Cable ) , and a nation 's attention was not scattered come World Series time . Year in , year out , men and boys in every corner of the country were given to understand during this autumnal rite that there really was only one baseball team and that there really was only one player : No. 7 , talked with a twang , knocked the ball a country mile . But it was more than circumstance that fixed Mantle in the national psyche ; he did hit 18 World Series home runs , a record , over the course of 65 of the most watched games of our lives . // Even knowing that , acknowledging the pinstriped pedigree , the fascination still does n't add up . If he was a pure talent , he was not , as we found out , a pure spirit . But to look upon his youthful mug today , three decades after he played , is to realize how uncluttered our memories of him are . Yes , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he himself said so . And still , looking at the slightly uplifted square jaw , all we see is America 's romance with boldness , its celebration of muscle , a continent 's comfort in power during a time when might did make right . Mantle was the last great player on the last great team in the last great country , a postwar civilization that was booming and confident , not a trouble in the world . // Of course , even had he not reflected the times , Mantle would have been walking Americana . His career was storybook stuff , hewing more to our ideas of myth than any player 's since Ruth . Spotted playing shortstop on the Baxter Springs Whiz Kids , he was delivered from a rural obscurity into America 's distilled essence of glamour . One year Mantle is dropping 400 feet into the earth , very deep into Oklahoma , to mine lead on his father 's crew , another he 's spilling drinks with Whitey Ford and Billy Martin at the Copa. // A lesson reaffirmed : Anything can happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're daring in their defeats and outsized in victory . Failure is forgiven of the big swingers , in whom even foolishness is flamboyant . Do you remember Mantle in Pittsburgh in the 1960 Series , twice whiffing in Game 1 and then , the next day , crushing two ? Generations of men still do . The world will always belong to those who swing from the heels . // Still , Mantle 's grace was mostly between the lines ; he developed no particular bonds beyond his teammates , and he established no popularity outside of baseball . As he was dying from liver cancer , none of the pre-tributes remarked much on his charm . And , as he was dying from a disease that many have presumed was drinking-related , there was a revisionist cast to the remembrances . Maybe he was n't so much fun after all . // But , back then , he most certainly was . Drunkenness had a kind of high-life cachet in the ' 50s : It was manly , inasmuch as you were a stand-up guy who could be counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamorous . Down the road , as Mantle would later confess from the other side of rehabilitation , it was merely stupid . But palling around with Billy and Whitey  --  just boys , really , they all had little boys ' names  --  it amounted to low-grade mischief . Whatever harm was being done to families and friends , it was a small price to pay for the excitement conferred upon a workaday nation . // In any event , we do n't mind our heroes flawed , or even doomed . Actually , our interest in Mantle was probably piqued by his obvious destiny , the ruin he often foretold . As a Yankee he was never a whole person , having torn up his knee for the first time in his first World Series in ' 51 . Thereafter , increasingly , he played in gauze and pain , his prodigal blasts heroically backlit by chronic injury . But more : At the hospital after that ' 51 incident , Mantle learned that his father , Mutt , admitted to the same hospital that same day , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastation that had claimed every Mantle male before the age of 40 . The black knowledge of this looming end informed everything Mickey did ; there was little time , and every event had to be performed on a grand scale , damn the consequences . Everything was excused. // As we all know , having participated in this gloomy death watch , it did n't end with that kind of drama . It was Billy , the third of Mantle 's four sons , who came down with Hodgkin 's , and who later died of a heart attack at 36 . Mickey lived much longer , prospering in an era of nostalgia , directionless in golf and drinking , coasting on a fame that confounded him ( Why was this man , just introduced to him , weeping ? ) . // Then Mantle , who might forever have been embedded in a certain culture , square-jawed and unchanged , did a strange thing . Having failed to die in a way that might have satisfied the mythmakers , he awoke with a start and checked himself into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half ago , and , of course , it was way too late almost any way you figure it . Still , his remorse seemed genuine . The waste seemed to gall him , and his anger shook the rest of us. // The generation of men who watched him play baseball , flipped for his cards or examined every box score must now puzzle out the attraction he held . The day he died there was the usual rush for perspective and the expected sweep through the Yankee organization . They said the usual things . But former teammate Bobby Murcer reported that he had talked to the Mick before he had gone into the hospital the final time  --  neither a liver transplant nor chemotherapy could arrest the cancer or stop his pain  --  and Mantle , first thing , asked how a fund-raiser for children affected by the Oklahoma City bombing was going , something he and Murcer , also from Oklahoma , were involved in . It was odd , like the sudden decision to enter rehab and rescue his and his family 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantle . // But let 's just say you were of this generation of men , that you once had been a kid growing up in the ' 50s , on some baseball team in Indiana , and you remember stitching a No. 7 on the back of your KIRCHNER 'S PHARMACY T-shirt , using red thread and having no way of finishing off a stitch , meaning your hero 's number would unravel indefinitely and you would have to do it over and over , stupid and unreformed in your idolatry . And today here 's this distant demigod , in his death , taking human shape . What would you think now ?
