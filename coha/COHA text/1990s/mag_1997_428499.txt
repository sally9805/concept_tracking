Section : Pictures of 1997 Despite her high station , Diana was Everywoman . Her ordeals and faults made her seem one of us . <p> Why did we weep ? diana was not a saint ; in fact , she was a sinner , as she herself admitted in a remarkably candid 1995 television interview . ( " I adored him , " she said of her lover and riding instructor , James Hewitt . ) She <p> could be , at times , foolish , outrageous , extravagant-even a little bit nuts . She suffered from depression and bulimia , and she once slashed her chest and thighs with her husband 's penknife in a desperate but unsuccessful plea for his attention . Yet she was also a devoted mother , a faithful friend and a dedicated champion of the causes she cared about . And no matter how bad she felt inside , she always looked so good . <p> Women , especially , felt they knew Diana . They knew her because her experiences resonated with a generation obsessed with self-examination and self-improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her seem vulnerable , accessible , human . In the terrible days between her death and her funeral , the mourners ' refrain was notably consistent : " She was one of us . " <p> That 's why we wept . We felt she was one of us . <p> Of course , Diana was Everywoman on a uniquely grand and glamorous scale , morphing from princess bride to rejected wife to confident divorcEe-all the while dressed in glorious clothes and coifed to perfection . Her drama played out on the most public of stages , beginning in 1981 with the wedding of the century , which was watched by three quarters of a billion people in 74 countries , and ending in a funeral also televised live around the world . But those who watched her suffer and grow over the years felt there was a real person behind all that gloss . Although she entered our consciousness because of the man she married , by the time of her death she was an object of intense fascination because of the woman she had become on her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say : " Been there , done that . . . wish I 'd done that . " <p> Diana was a woman scorned who developed a masterful fury . She got mad and then she got even in world-class style . A famous example : in 1994 , on the night Charles confessed to adultery in a television interview , Diana appeared at a London benefit in what the tabloids described as her revenge dress , a sexy off-the-shoulder black number . The design , by Christina Stambolian , brought $74,000 when it was auctioned for charity at Christie 's earlier this year ( now , that 's revenge ) . <p> Diana 's life story had something for everyone . Her parents split up when she was 6 . It was a devastating experience that left her with a profound loneliness she said she could never quite erase . It did n't really matter that her father was an earl and that her mother was also from a wealthy , well-connected family ; any child of divorce could identify with Diana 's sense of loss . Marriage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seemed to be the happy ending every lonely girl dreams of . What union could be more secure ? But the reality behind palace doors was instead the stuff of which TV melodramas are made . As we all now know , Charles could not give up the love of his life , Camilla Parker Bowles . According to Diana 's biographer , Andrew Morton , Diana began to discover the true nature of the relationship during her engagement . Two weeks before the wedding , she found out that Charles was giving Camilla a bracelet with an enameled disc embellished with the entwined initials G and F , for Gladys and Fred , the couple 's pet names for each other . When Diana sought sympathy from her two older sisters , Sarah and Jane , they told her it was too late to back out because " your face is already on the tea towels . " <p> Ah , the ever-present call of duty . Even in her darkest days , Diana understood what was expected of her . And there were quite a few dark days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply depressed after William 's birth . " I ca n't remember much , " she recalled in interviews for the Morton book . " I 've blotted it out , it was such pain . " Privately , she was bingeing and purging many times a week . But when the spotlight was on , she and Charles appeared blissful . " We did n't want to disappoint the public , " she said . <p> That uncanny ability to put up a good front enhanced the aura of mystery she managed to maintain even as she told her deepest secrets . As she grew ever more skillful in her manipulation of the constant media attention , she doled out tantalizing tidbits , quick peeks into her soul . On a visit to India in 1992 , she deliberately posed alone at the Taj Mahal-a monument built by an emperor to show his love for his dead wife . Charles stayed away , even though he had reportedly once promised to take her to the romantic site . Diana was smiling and she looked terrific , but the message was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of celebrated Diana images that helped create her legend . <p> After she and Charles officially separated in 1992 , Diana appeared to be struggling to redefine her life on her own terms . Again , it was a struggle many women could identify with . It 's true that some of her problems were clearly unique-how to find a man who would n't be intimidated by her celebrity , how to maintain the dignity required of the mother of the future king while enjoying the freedom of singlehood , how to live in princessly style on a mere $26 million divorce settlement . <p> Familiar paths : But the crux of her dilemma was easy for many women to grasp , and she traveled some familiar paths . She worked out regularly at a London gym and was often photographed in exercise clothes that any woman could have worn . She sought out New Age healers and therapists . She tried to find meaning in her work , plunging into a pared-down list of causes she really cared about . Her well-publicized January 1997 visit to Angola did much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with maimed victims and said it was " traumatic " to witness such suffering . Last summer she was in Bosnia , where she met with more land-mine victims . <p> Diana 's efforts as a single mother also struck a chord with many women . William and Harry were away at boarding school much of the year , and she had to split vacations with Charles . Her empty nest may have been in Kensington Palace , but that did not make it any less empty . At her funeral her brother , Charles , said she was determined that her sons ' souls be allowed to " sing openly " despite the constraints of duty and tradition . Over the years , she had tried to cultivate that spirit by taking them on the kinds of excursions millions of parents enjoy with their kids-to amusement parks , sports events , burger joints . " I want them to have an understanding of people 's emotions , people 's insecurities , people 's distress and people 's hopes and dreams , " she once said . <p> About the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't the only woman in the world with bad taste and bad luck . Another point of empathy . Years earlier , in an interview she gave for the Morton book , Diana said that she longed for a normal life , which to her meant " things like a weekend in Paris . " She knew she would have to wait , but , she said , " I know one day if I play the rules of life-the game of life-I will be able to have those things I 've always pined for . " Dodi Fayed was an unexpected choice for a princess , but he offered that weekend in Paris , loving attention , enough money to buy some privacy and a luxu- rious vacation aboard the family yacht . <p> In those final glorious days cruising the Mediterranean , perhaps Diana remembered another voyage , 16 summers earlier , aboard the royal yacht Britannia . It was her honeymoon , and her new husband 's idea of a good time was for the two of them to read and analyze ( over lunch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compare that with a moment captured by the Ritz Hotel 's security cameras just before Diana and Dodi disappeared into the black Mercedes S280 for their fatal last ride . Dodi has his arm around her waist , trying to protect and comfort her . <p> Who knows what image will endure a hundred years from now ? The rejected wife , the doting mother , the glamorous superstar , the champion of causes-Diana was certainly all of those . For the moment , it may be enough to remember that she was that rare woman who hardly ever had a bad hair day , and , for much too brief a time , she had the brightest smile on earth . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Diana <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Depicting Diana 's likeness on various magazine covers throughout the world . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : A loving tribute : The note , placed on her casket by her sons , bore the title Diana cherished most . <p> By Barbara Kantrowitz <p> CASE VERY NEARLY CLOSED Police are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash looks like a routine accident <p> THE VICTIMS OF THE fatal crash in a Paris tunnel last August were anything but ordinary . But investigators now believe that the accident that killed Princess Diana and her boyfriend , Dodi Fayed , was just that-ordinary . Within days of the crash , sources say , French police had all but discarded stories of paparazzi cutting off the doomed Mercedes and settled on a much more mundane explanation : Diana and her boyfriend were killed in a routine drunken-driving accident . Repeated lab tests showed the driver of the car , Henri Paul , who was also killed , had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit . <p> Now the Fayeds , who had denied since the crash that Paul was drinking in the hotel , are admitting that he was . For the first time , Michael Cole , a Fayed spokesman , has told NEWSWEEK that Paul drank two glasses of pastis-a licorice-flavored liqueur-over a two-hour period in the Ritz Hotel bar on the night of the crash . Paul sold sailboats before joining the staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal training as a security officer . The Fayeds have pointed to a medical certificate Paul received three days before the crash to prove that he could not have been habitually drinking or using drugs . But the doctor who signed the certificate says blood is n't usually screened in such cases . <p> Still , conspiracy theories persist . While Dodi 's father , Mohamed Al Fayed , has publicly expressed faith in the investigation , privately he is said to believe that someone conspired to kill his son and the princess . People close to Fayed say Diana thought she was being spied on by British intelligence and even believed that agents had arranged a motorcycle accident that killed one of her favorite bodyguards . They also say a drawing made by police after the accident has disappeared . Cole says questions surrounding the crash could grow to rival those that have dogged the death of JFK . <p> The Fayeds still think the paparazzi should share the blame , too . Cole says one photographer threatened bodyguards in an altercation hours before the crash . The Fayeds even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying Diana 's neck ; the box it came in was found in the car , but not the jewels . Another missing piece of jewelry , an engagement-type ring Dodi gave to Di , was found among his effects in his apartment . <p> Meanwhile , the Brigade Criminelle , France 's storied investigative unit , is still searching the Paris area each morning for a mysterious white Fiat that may have been involved in the accident . Cops grumble that while these elite detectives go all out on what now seems to be a plain case of drunken driving , a suspected serial killer haunts the streets of Paris . Even in death , it seems , Di and Dodi ca n't get out of the spotlight . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Two drinks at the bar : Chauffeur Henri Paul with Diana and Dodi , about to leave the Ritz <p> MARK HOSENBALL in London and CHRISTOPHER DICKEY in Paris <p>
