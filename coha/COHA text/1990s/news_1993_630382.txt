WHAT DO MAUREEN Dowd , Thomas Friedman , Paul Krugman , and Muammar Qaddafi have in common ? All of them write for the New York Times op-ed page . Qaddafi , who made his debut on the page in January , has been Libya 's dictator since 1969 , when , as a 27-year-old army captain , he led a coup that toppled the monarchy . He later became a colonel , but he was too modest to accept promotion to general- although not too modest to style himself " Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Arab Libyan Popular and Socialist Jamahiriya . " His full title being perhaps a bit unwieldy , the Times 's author bio blandly stated , " Muammar Qaddafi is the leader of Libya . " The subject of Qaddafi 's article was the territory formerly known as Palestine , now divided between the nation of Israel and the disputed West Bank and Gaza Strip . The disputed territories were occupied by Jordan and Egypt , respectively , after the Arabs rejected a 1947 UN resolution calling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli occupation after the Six-Day War in 1967 . The common view is that the ultimate resolution of the conflict is a " two-state solution , " in which Israel would cede all or most of the disputed territories to a new Arab nation called Palestine . It seems reasonable , even obvious , but there are practical impediments . One is the asymmetry of Arab demands for a " right of return " - i.e. , that Palestinian Arabs whose ancestors lived in what is now Israel be allowed to resettle there . By contrast , no one talks about a Jewish " right of return " to Arab countries , including the prospective Palestine , and Arabs demand that Jews who have settled in the disputed territories be expelled . There is also a question of whether the Palestinian Arabs and their leaders , or the regimes that rule other Arab countries , really want a Palestinian state as opposed to the destruction of Israel , or at least an excuse to continue using the Jewish state as a scapegoat . In any case , Qaddafi has a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-state solution , " an Tsratine ' that would allow the people in each party to feel that they live in all of the disputed land and they are not deprived of any one part of it " : Assimilation is already a fact of life in Israel . There are more than one million Muslim Arabs in Israel ; they possess Israeli nationality and take part in political life with the Jews , forming political parties . On the other side , there are Israeli settlements in the West Bank . Israeli factories depend on Palestinian labor , and goods and services are exchanged . This successful assimilation can be a model for Isratine . If the present interdependence and the historical fact of Jewish-Palestinian coexistence guide their leaders , and if they can see beyond the horizon of the recent violence and thirst for revenge toward a long-term solution , then these two peoples will come to realize , I hope sooner rather than later , that living under one roof is the only option for a lasting peace . Is he serious ? Journalist Claudia Rosett doubts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail from Youssef Ibrahim , a Dubai-based consultant and onetime Times correspondent , who argues that Qaddafi 's proposal was meant as a joke : Youssef explains that in Arabic , " tine " means " mud , " or , " in more evident colloquial Arabic a piece of excrement , dirt , garbage , refuse . " ... And while the Times may have missed the sick joke in its own Op-ed columns , the Arab media did not . Apparently it 's a retread from Qaddafi 's repertoire . Youssef notes that Qaddafi has used the " tine " suffix before , attaching it as a dismissive insult to various other words ( " socialism-tine , " " capitalism-tine " ) and that " Isratine " first came up a couple of years ago . It has been widely commented upon- as comedy- by Arab pundits . Let 's give Qaddafi 's editors at the Times the benefit of the doubt and assume that they took his proposal seriously . Did it not occur to them how fanciful it is ? Even assuming that Israel 's democratic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isratine 's " Jews would soon be outnumbered by Arabs , given demographic trends and the " right of return , " which Qaddafi endorses . In theory there is no reason an Arab majority in a democracy could not respect the rights of a Jewish minority . In practice , however , the Arab track record in this regard is dismal , and the Palestinians of the disputed territories have been indoctrinated for generations in Nazi-style Jew hatred . An actual " Isratine " would likely soon become another backward Arab-dominated regime , with Jews subjugated or worse . Israeli Arabs would be far less free than they are today ; Palestinian Arabs , probably not much better off . Qaddafi 's Times article includes a glaring falsehood that bears on the impracticality of his proposal , and that gives further reason to doubt his good faith in offering it . By way of conceding a point , he writes : The basis for the modern State of Israel is the persecution of the Jewish people , which is undeniable . The Jews have been held captive , massacred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans , the English , the Russians , the Babylonians , the Canaanites and , most recently , the Germans under Hitler . The Jewish people want and deserve their homeland . In fact , the Nazis were not the most recent persecutors of Jews . Many Israeli Jews are refugees from persecution in Arab countries since World War II ( and Iran since 1979 ) . Aside from Morocco , no Arab land has more than a handful Jews left- and that includes Libya . Vivienne Roumani-Denn , director of the 2007 documentary The Last Jews of Libya , recounts on her web page the fate of Libya 's Jews : By 1941 , the Jews accounted for a quarter of the population of Tripoli and maintained 44 synagogues . In 1942 the Germans occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi , plundered shops , and deported more than 2,000 Jews across the desert , where more than one-fifth of them perished . Many Jews from Tripoli were also sent to forced labor camps . Conditions did not greatly improve following the liberation . During the British occupation , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1945 , resulted in the deaths of more than 100 Jews in Tripoli and other towns and the destruction of five synagogues . A growing sense of insecurity , coupled with the establishment of the State of Israel , led many Jews to leave the country . Although emigration was illegal , more than 3,000 Jews succeeded in leaving , and many went to Israel . When the British legalized emigration in 1949 , more than 30,000 Jews fled Libya . At the time of Colonel Qaddafi 's coup in 1969 , some 500 Jews remained in Libya . Qaddafi subsequently confiscated all Jewish property and cancelled all debts owed to Jews . By 1974 there were no more than 20 Jews , and it is believed that the Jewish presence has passed out of existence . In fairness to Qaddafi , he did not begin the persecution of Libyan Jews . But is n't there some rule of journalistic ethics that should have compelled the Times to disclose to its readers that its author is the man who , in his own country , finished what Hitler started ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
