Sure that vacation house looks tempting in August , but hold your horses  --  and your checkbook . The time to buy , and save big , is now . <p> Buying a vacation house can be a lot like falling in love . At the very least , it carries some of the same risks : when the heat of infatuation and the height of the season are gone , a buyer might find himself having to squint a little to see the merits of what , just a few months before , seemed ideally suited to him . <p> That 's why the best time to buy a summer house is in the fall . As the air turns crisp , so do our business instincts . When we travel back to the beach after Labor Day , we 're seeing houses as they really are , without the colorful background painted by cavorting , sun-bronzed vacationers . <p> There are other advantages : in the fall , sellers get a little antsy . " Prices do drop in the fall , " says Steven Miner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research firm , Ragatz Associates . " Most people would just as soon discount and get out from under " as carry mortgages and tax costs through yet another off-season . <p> In the fall , there are fewer buyers to compete with , not only on price but for the time and attention of real estate agents . A late fall or early winter purchase also gives the buyer time to get the house ready for the next season and to start picking up the rental deposits that begin coming in after the new year , according to Bethany Beach , Del. , agent Trip Wilkinson . " Those early deposits can give you a jump on income . " If that 's your objective . <p> Norman Kerr Jr. , a Chicago marketing director , went second house hunting in Michigan 's Harbor Country when everyone else was starting to close up for the winter . " It was an excellent time to buy ; everybody else was going back to school , " he says . He bought his Lake Michigan cottage for $115,000 in September 1988 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had he waited until the next spring , when " everybody 's got the fever , " Kerr believes the property would have cost him $140,000 or more . <p> Interest in the vacation home market continues on a long-term growth trend , despite pockets of weakness in some regions this year . The National Association of Home Builders estimates that there are some five million second homes in America , and about 70,000 more being built each year . <p> Here , then , are a few things to consider before going too far down the gravel path or beach road to the cottage of your dreams . " Where exactly is this house ? " <p> Location , that real estate priority , is even more important in a vacation home . Property closest to the action , be it the ski slope , the ocean front , or the marina , is always easier to rent and resell at a profit . " I 've seen houses that are just one block too far in either direction to rent successfully , " says Anne Austin , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realtors . " Location is everything in a rental . " " This is n't going to fall in the ocean , is it ? ' " <p> These days , most banks shy away from giving a mortgage on a house that is not built safely back from the hurricane line . But as Michael Luzier , director of environmental regulation at the National Association of Home Builders , explains , there 's more than that to ensuring a beach house 's stability . <p> If the lowest floor of a beach house is n't above the base flood elevation for the property , the insurance premiums can jump thousands of dollars a year . Any area below that flood line , such as a parking garage , should be enclosed with breakaway walls , and " hurricane clips " should secure the roof to the walls , and the walls to the floor . " Make sure the house is adequately tied , " Luzier emphasizes . " Bracing is everything . " <p> Keep in mind , too , that today 's ocean view can become tomorrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of erosion , a house that now stands ten feet from the ocean may have been fronted by 100 feet of beach 15 or 20 years ago . <p> Near a lake , water quality can be a concern . A lot of algae on the surface is one sign of poor water quality . Another is the presence of many old septic systems on small lots near the lake , according to Luzier . It 's always worth checking with local environmental officials for water quality readings . " Will I make money if I rent it out ? ' " <p> The house that covers its own costs with rental income is a dream , not a reality . " Let me put it this way , " says Tim Creef , an independent agent on the Outer Banks of North Carolina . " If a home comes on the market that carries itself , the agents will buy it . " <p> Long-term , summer home prices have gone up faster than rents . New buyers will usually only take in enough rent to cover maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven Miner says . Additionally , insurance can cost more on a rental property , and a rental manager is a good idea . Most take about 15% to 20% of gross rentals , and clean the cottage between tenants , arrange routine maintenance , and rent out the cottage . <p> " A one-week rental will pay the management fee for a whole season , " says Washington , D.C. , executive Holly Pollinger , a former beach house owner . " I would never advise anybody to try to rent it on their own . " " What kind of mortgage can I get ? " <p> " All the lenders behave very differently when they know it 's a vacation home , " one realtor lets on knowingly . " It sort of raises a red flag . " <p> Vacation properties cause mortgage bankers more headaches than do first mortgages . Defaults are higher , and the loans are harder to unload in the secondary mortgage market . <p> As a result , the down payments tend to be larger , the interest rates higher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustable rate loans or short-term loans , " says Henry Berliner , president and chief executive officer of the Second National Federal Savings Bank in Annapolis , Maryland . Second National will give 30-year loans on vacation homes , but charges interest that 's generally a quarter of a percentage point higher than for a first home loan . If a vacation home needs the rental income to qualify for the mortgage , the property gets classified as an investment , and the rates go another quarter or half of a percentage point over that . <p> Many people are now tapping into the home equity on their first homes to finance their vacation properties . This can be easier to arrange than a new loan through a distant bank . But unless they 've already paid off most of their first mortgage , or their house has seen significant appreciation , their second loan on their first house probably will come at an even higher rate than the typical vacation property loan . " Any hidden costs I should know about before I sign on the dotted line ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dock charges , and furniture  --  a second home has to be furnished right down to the spaghetti pot and can opener , and that can easily run as much as $20,000 . In most resort areas , there are companies that put together complete furnishing packages  --  for a fee , of course . WHEN TO BUY , WHERE <p> Ask any real estate agent when it 's the best time to buy , and of course he 'll say , " Right now , and I just listed this great home , and it 's going to be snapped up fast if you do n't look at it today . " <p> But persist , and prices in most U.S. resort areas seem a little softer , and sellers a little more agreeable , at harvest time . <p> Herewith a brief survey of what agents are saying about fall conditions in their regions : Sun Valley <p> " Fall is a good time here . After Labor Day , all the kids go home ; it 's quiet . All the spec homes are closer to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people who already have properties listed may get jumpy . If it already has n't sold , maybe they 'll take less money . "  --  GARY VINAGRE , Bitterroot-White Cloud Properties <p> Kennebunkport <p> " There are a lot of choices in the fall . People decide to sell after the summer is over so there are good choices . People feel they can strike a better deal in the fall . Sometimes that is true , owners do n't want to carry their homes through the winter . People who wait until the spring to buy will have to pay a bit more . "  --  BARBARA AIELLO , Aiello &; Co . Real Estate <p> North Carolina 's Outer Banks <p> " In the fall , there are a lot of people down here for the specific purpose of buying ; and prices seem to have spiraled up in the last ten years regardless of season . But a lot of sellers are n't as willing to sell in spring as in late fall , because of the carrying cost for the winter . "  --  TIM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably our best selling time is from Labor Day to Thanksgiving ; more things come on the market then . It 's the time to plan and choose for next year . "  --  MARY LOU JOHNSON , Re/Max Harbor Country Real Estate <p> Texas Hill Country <p> " Prices here can drop 5% to 10% when we move into fall . The Texas economy has not been great , and houses here have been on the market for six to nine months . So if a house is still on the market in the fall , you will get a better buy . The owners are more willing to make a consideration of terms or change their prices . We see terms relaxed , more owner financing , smaller down payments , and longer amortizations on fall sales . "  --  TOM STACY , president , Highland Lakes Association of Realtors , Marble Falls , Texas <p> Lake Tahoe <p> " A lot of times , fall is going to be a busy market . The people are too busy enjoying themselves in the summer to talk about buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to buy . But as it gets closer to ski season , the sellers are n't so desperate to unload . The really best time to get good buys up here is in February and March . " CRAIG BECK , Don Beck Realty <p> Aspen <p> " In the fall , it is easier to see properties because they are not occupied ; but there is no change in prices . There really is n't a slow season in Aspen .
