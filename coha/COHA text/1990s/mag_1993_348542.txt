IT WAS N'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN HERE . NOT IN America . Not in New York City . But it did . On Friday , just past noon , what is believed to be a car bomb exploded in an underground garage beneath Manhattan 's 110-story World Trade Center . The blast and the resulting smoke and fire killed at least five people and injured 1,042 . It forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate the buildings . It snarled traffic , stopped train service and knocked TV stations ( many had antennas on the roof ) off the air . The blast created a 200-ft. by 100-ft. crater . It also forged heroes . A woman in a wheelchair was carried down 66 stories by two friends . A pregnant woman was airlifted from a tower roof . <P> New York City police commissioner Raymond Kelly cited three indicators pointing toward a bomb : traces of nitrate , the magnitude of the explosion and the amount of heat generated . Although talk of a terrorist attack was immediate , the FBI and the police refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 phone calls claiming responsibility , but all came more than an hour after the explosion , and none offered any details that would have been known only to the bomber and police .
