Like a motorist picking up his car from the repair shop , the two Marine pilots expected their Bell AH-1 Cobra to be running smoothly when they went to retrieve it . After all , the two-man gunship had been in the Fort Worth , Texas , factory nearly a year for a $1.8 million overhaul . But Major Michael Browne and 1st Lieut . Robert Straw found enough problems with the chopper to delay their departure a day . Then , 20 minutes after they took off in the late afternoon of May 23 , 1997 , they were killed when their aircraft plunged into a field 15 miles southeast of Dallas . <P> Four days later  --  the day after Memorial Day  --  their North Carolina unit 's Marines gathered in their chapel at New River air station . " Semper Fidelis , " they intoned solemnly before 700 mourners . " We will never forget you . " But despite the service 's long and treasured tradition of mutual trust and fierce loyalty , forgetting their men is precisely what the Marines seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 2,500 hrs. of flawless flying between them , spent the final seconds of their life steering their Cobra away from a school as its twin engines sputtered , slowing its rotor blades nearly to a halt . Upon impact , the aircraft exploded into a 1,500degreeF fireball , fed by 300 gal . of jet fuel . The conflagration destroyed the helicopter , making it impossible to determine the cause of the crash . <P> But the Marine investigation into the accident , obtained by TIME , points to an apparent culprit . According to a lengthy list of snafus detailed in the official probe , the Marines accuse Bell of allowing the helicopter to take off even though the Pentagon had ordered it grounded because of five urgent safety problems . Two of the five requested fixes were designed to prevent a loss of engine power , which investigators for the families believe caused the crash . The report concluded that the Cobra should never have taken off until these and other repairs had been made . Bell has shed little light on the tragedy . After conferring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work on the helicopter changed their statements to shift responsibility away from their company . ( Bell , citing a suit filed by the pilots ' families , declined to comment on the case . ) <P> Yet despite Bell 's actions , the Marines have done nothing  --  not even scolded the company . A Pentagon official , trying to explain the Marines ' passive treatment of Bell , says the company exerts a strong " gravitational pull " on the service . Bell reaps 95% of the Marines ' spending on helicopters each year , or more than $1 billion . More critically , some Pentagon officials suggest that the Marines do n't want the crash to jeopardize Bell 's $36 billion V-22 program . That Marine " tilt-rotor " aircraft , which takes off and lands like a helicopter and cruises like a turboprop airplane , is on the verge of lifting off after more than a decade of troubled development .
