" How nice all this is ! " Rose 's mother cried , with dishes on the way to the dinner table Rose had laid . " What weather , Mr. Bouverie , do n't you think ? Please sit here next to me . " <p> Obediently , Mr. Bouverie did so , replying to the comment about the weather . <p> " Ca n't stand a heat wave , " Mr. Dakin cheerfully grumbled . <p> Rose 's father  --  Mrs. Dakin 's better half , so she insisted  --  was bluff and genial . He spoke with a hoarseness , always keeping his voice down as if saving it for professional use , he being an auctioneer . Apart from her shrillness , there was a similarity about his wife : both were large and shared an ease often to be found in people of their girth and stature . This evening Mr. Dakin was sweating , as he tended to in summer ; he had taken his jacket off and undone the buttons of the waistcoat he always wore no matter what the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighteen and wished , this evening , she could be somewhere else . She wished she did n't have to meet Mr. Bouverie 's weary eyes or watch him being polite , listening with inclined head to her mother , smiling at her father 's bonhomie . The occasion was a celebration : Rose was to go to university ; Mr. Bouverie had had a hand in her success . As a tutor , he had made borderline cases his business for more than thirty years , but intended to no longer , Rose being his last . My God , this is appalling , she thought . She had begged her mother not to issue this invitation , but Mrs. Dakin had insisted that they must . Mr. Bouverie had attempted to refuse but had then been offered a choice of evenings . <p> " How I adore the asparagus season ! " Rose heard her mother cry in her vivacious way , pressing a dish of the vegetable , well buttered , on their visitor . <p> Mr. Bouverie smiled and murmured his appreciation . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticeable on the freckled pate of his head . There were freckles , also , on the backs of his hands , on old worn skin like dried-out chamois . He wore a pale suit and one of his colorful Italian bow ties . <p> " And how is your world , Mr. Bouverie ? " Mr. Dakin civilly inquired . <p> " Shrinking , " Mr. Bouverie replied . " That is something you notice as you age . " <p> Mrs. Dakin bubbled into good-sort laughter . Mr. Dakin poured Mouton-Cadet Graves . <p> " You shrink yourself , of course . " Mr. Bouverie obligingly pursued the subject , since it was clear the Dakins liked to have a conversation going . He smiled at Rose . Half his teeth were still his own , gray and sucked away to crags . <p> " Good tidings for the obese , " mumbled Mr. Dakin , his features screwed up as they often were when he made a joke . Directed against himself , his banter caused his wife to exclaim : <p> " Oh , Bobo , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be six foot and half an inch , " Mr. Bouverie labored on . " I 'm nothing like that now . " <p> " But otherwise all is well ? " Mr. Dakin inquired . <p> " Oh , yes , indeed . " <p> Mrs. Dakin had had her dining room papered blue , a dark stripe and a lighter one . Curtains matched , the paintwork was white . Mrs. Dakin enjoyed this side of things and often said so : leafless delphiniums patterned her drawing room ; her hall and staircase were black and gold . <p> " I say , this is awfully good , " Mr. Dakin complimented his wife on what she had done with the turkey slices that accompanied the asparagus . <p> " Delicious , " Mr. Bouverie affirmed . <p> Rose wore a slate gray dress , with a collar that folded back . Unlike her parents , Rose was petite , her fair hair cut short , a fringe following the curve of her forehead , her eyes a forget-me-not shade of blue . Her guilt , this evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . When it did her lower lip lost its bee-sting look and for an instant her white , irregular teeth appeared . She felt awkward and unpretty at the dinner table , sick of herself . <p> " We cultivate it late in our garden , " her mother was saying , still talking about the asparagus , of which Rose had taken only a single shoot . " Our season runs almost to September . " <p> What kind of an ordeal was it for him ? Rose wondered . They had asked his wife as well , but a message had come the day before to say that Mrs. Bouverie was unwell . Rose knew that was n't true . His wife had seized the opportunity ; she 'd said to him she could n't be bothered , but that was n't true either . His wife would be naked now , Rose thought . <p> " Extraordinary , what you read on the cars ' rear windows , " her mother suddenly remarked , the subject of a particular season for asparagus now exhausted . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why on earth should a total stranger be interested in that ? " <p> " I think you 're being told not to drive too close , " Rose 's father suggested . <p> Tinkling with unmalicious social laughter , her mother pointed out that it was an enticement to drive too close in order to read what was said . <p> " They have n't thought of that , my dear . " <p> In all her chosen subjects Rose had been a borderline case , and so every Thursday afternoon for almost a year had gone to Mr. Bouverie 's house , where they had sat together in the bay window that looked out into the garden . Mrs. Bouverie brought tea as soon as Rose arrived , and while they drank it Mr. Bouverie did n't attempt to teach but instead talked about the past , about his own life when he had been about to go to university himself , and later being interviewed for a position in the worsted-cloth business . He had tried the worsted trade for a while and then had turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tedium of " hobbies time , " when the boys put together model airplanes , caused him to give it up after a year . Ever since , he had received pupils in his house , deciding only a month or so ago that Rose should be the last of them . " Anno Domini , " he 'd said , but Rose knew that was n't the reason . During all those teatimes he had spun his life out like a serial . <p> " But it 's odd , " Mrs. Dakin lightly persisted . " Do n't you agree with me , Mr. Bouverie ? " <p> The old man hesitated , and Rose could see he had momentarily lost track of the conversation . She knew her mother would notice also and not be dismayed . Smoothly her mother said , " All those personal declarations on cars  --  whom people love , where they 've been , who occupies the two front seats . " <p> " Sharon and Liam usually , " Mr. Dakin good-humoredly guffawed . <p> Mrs. Bouverie , ten years younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Bouverie , slim and silky , with long legs and a wrinkled pout , too well made-up , received a visitor on Thursday afternoons because her husband was occupied with the last of his pupils then , concentrating on a borderline case 's weaknesses . Mrs. Bouverie 's visitor came softly , but there were half-muffled sounds , like shadows passing through the house , a pattern of whispers and footfalls , a gently closed door , and always  --  ten minutes or so before Rose was due to leave the house herself  --  the lightest of footsteps on the stairs and in the hall . It was a pattern that belonged with Mrs. Bouverie 's placing the tea tray on the pale mahogany of the window table , her scent lingering after she left the room , the restlessness in her eyes . But Rose had n't entirely guessed the nature of the weekly rendezvous until the afternoon she went to fetch a handkerchief from her coat pocket on the hallstand and saw a sallow-faced man with a latchkey in his hand breathlessly closing the hall door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret smile . <p> " Younger than her ? " Rose 's friend Caroline , sharp on detail , wanted to know , and Rose said no , not much , but beautifully turned out in a brown linen suit , a gray-haired man , and elegant . " Not come to mend something ? " suggested Daisy , who could not help being skeptical when someone else claimed the limelight . Her doubts were scorned at once by Angela and Liz , for why should a repairer of washing machines or television sets be in possession of a latchkey and be dressed so ? Why should he come so regularly ? Why should he smile a secret smile ? In the Box Tree Cafe where the five girls gossiped and complained of this and that , where they talked about sex and other private matters , where Daisy and Caroline smoked , Mrs. Bouverie 's Thursday lover became the subject of intense and specific speculation . He was married , Caroline said , which was why he had to come to her house : in illicit love affairs there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on Thursdays because , Rose being the last of Mr. Bouverie 's pupils , there was no other time when he was fully occupied as perhaps there had been in the past , when there were other pupils . " That kind of thing and she 's fifty ? " Daisy frowned through the words , but Angela said fifty was nothing . " I do not intend to be unfaithful , " Liz romantically declared , but the others were n't interested in that , any more than they wished to dwell for long on the advanced age of Mrs. Bouverie . <p> What fascinated all of them , Daisy too in the end , was that while Rose sat in a room that had been described to them  --  a long , low-ceilinged room that had once been two , with sofas and armchairs and a circular mirror over the mantelpiece  --  somewhere upstairs a man and a woman got into bed together . " I would love to see him , " Caroline said . " Even a glance . " Was it like , each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw on the television or in the cinema ? Or was , somehow , the real thing quite different ? They argued about that . " I would not hesitate to be unfaithful , " Caroline said , " if things went stale . " Caroline was like that , her matter-of-factness sometimes sounding hard . Angela  --  long black hair , brown eyes , rarely smiling because of her braces  --  was the victim kind , and accident-prone . Liz gave too much , generosity part of her romantic nature . Daisy , red-haired and bespectacled , distrusted the world . Liz was the prettiest of the five , with neat features and flaxen hair in a ponytail , and a film star 's mouth , nothing particularly special except for deep blue eyes , but still the prettiest . Rose thought of herself as ordinary , too quiet , too shy and nervous : Mrs. Bouverie and her Thursday visitor were a godsend in her relationship with her friends . <p> " How nice all this is ! " Mrs. Dakin enthused for the second time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How hugely grateful to you we are , Mr. Bouverie ! " <p> Rose watched him shaking his head and heard him saying that the credit must go wholly to her . <p> " No , truly , Mr. Bouverie , " her father insisted with a solemn intonation . <p> " All her young life before her , " her mother threw in . <p> Rose had n't told them , or told her brother . It was n't the sort of thing that was talked about within this family . She would have been embarrassed and would have caused embarrassment  --  a very different reception from the one there 'd been when she had passed the information on in the Box Tree Cafe with its green-topped tables . After the first time , they had always been expectant . Not knowing what to say , not knowing how best to interrupt Caroline in full flow , or if being silent made her dull , or how to embroider some incident for effect , as clearly Daisy did : none of that mattered anymore . " It could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once . They had sat there , coffee drunk , Caroline and Daisy with their cigarettes , dwelling upon that , imagining Rose 's sallow-skinned man arriving in the surroundings that had been described to them . " Beautifully pressed , his linen suit , " Rose said . " And a plain green shirt . " <p> Around the dinner table the conversation , still powered by Mrs. Dakin , had changed again . " ' The Kindest Cut , ' " she was saying now , drawing Mr. Bouverie 's attention to the droll wit of hairdressers as exemplified in the titles chosen for their premises . " ' Nutters ' I saw the other day ! " <p> This evening , for the very last time , he would be there . Mr. Bouverie did not normally go out to dinner ; he 'd said as much when joining in the celebratory mood on his arrival . No tea tray had been carried to the window table since Rose had ceased to visit the house . The invitation for this evening must have seemed like a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a Mr. Azam , " her husband had said on the last but one of their Thursdays . " In case you are interested in his name . " <p> Mr. Dakin poured the wine again . He said they 'd gotten the glasses as a wedding present , only four of them left so they could n't use them often . <p> " The Mitages , " Mrs. Dakin murmured softly , the shrillness that whistled through her voice gone from it now . She paused in her eating , inclining her head in memory , slanting it a little to the left , a wistful smile enlivening her reddened lips . Mr. Dakin sighed ; then death passed on , and Mrs. Dakin picked up her fork again , and the wine bottle was replaced on its little silver tray , another wedding gift , although this was not said . <p> " Cuckold . " In the Box Tree Cafe the ugly word , spoken first by Caroline , formed in their minds , its sound acquiring shape and color . Only Rose knew what Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into it . It was not an old man who had once planned a future in the cloth trade and had ended as a tutor that was of interest . He was no rival for the darkened bedroom above the room that had once been two , or for the scent of Mrs. Bouverie , or her lover 's suit draped on a chair , or smears of lipstick left on sallow flesh . No one ever interposed a comment when Rose spread out for the delectation of her friends another Thursday harvest . Once , music softly played , " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes . " Once the telephone rang and was not answered by Mr. Bouverie , although the receiver was only yards from where they sat . Sooner than if he had crossed to it the ringing ceased , answered at the bedside . Not always , but now and again , Mrs. Bouverie appeared on the stairs when Rose was putting her coat on at the hallstand ; or in summer , when there was no coat , she sometimes called down good-bye when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vicious , " Liz said . " That 's a vicious woman . " But Rose said no , you could n't call Mrs. Bouverie vicious ; she did n't strike you as that . " More significant that she 's childless , " Daisy said . " Or at least it could be . " Caroline disagreed . <p> " Oh , my golly gosh ! " Rose 's father exclaimed with his auctioneer 's jolliness when gooseberry fool was placed in front of him . Mrs. Dakin said the gooseberries had been picked from her own bushes . <p> " Delicious , " Mr. Bouverie for the second time remarked , and the talk was of gooseberries for a while , of different varieties , one favored for this purpose , another for that . <p> " Mr. Azam , " she had announced in the Box Tree Cafe , and Daisy had gone at once to the telephone directory to look the name up . " Hundreds , " she 'd said , returning . " Hundreds of Azams . " In her absence the conversation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign one and then abandoned as a subject for discussion . " When a husband knows , " Caroline said , " he 's not so much a cuckold as complaisant . " And they talked about the fact that while Mr. Bouverie dealt with the last of his borderline cases he knew what was occurring all around him  --  the nature of the creaking stairs and closing doors , the light tap of footsteps not his wife 's , the snatch of music hushed . " Did he seem different when he said the name ? " Caroline sharply asked , and Rose said no . <p> Her brother , Jason , arrived . Like his parents , he was well covered , with a jowl that was identically his father 's and with his mother 's small fat hands , bland in his manner . It was because of Jason that Mr. Bouverie had been discovered , for Jason in his time had been a borderline case also . They greeted each other now , shaking hands and inquiring about each other 's well-being . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was over . <p> " Oh , well enough . The Chippendale fetched a price . A happy day 's business , " Mr. Dakin reported , smiling . <p> " How very nice ! " His wife glanced round the table , seeking to share her exultation in the day 's success . " All right , dear ? " she asked when it lighted on her daughter . " All right , Rose ? " <p> Rose nodded , lying . " I do mind , as a matter of fact , " he had said , as if he knew all about the Box Tree Cafe and the audience of five crowding the same green-topped corner table , as if he had listened to every word . Guilt had come then , the waves of guilt beginning in that moment . His spectacles had slipped to one side , and he adjusted them as soon as he had spoken . The cuffs of his blue tweed jacket were trimmed with leather . " Yes , " she said , not knowing what else to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " It was as though for all the months that had passed they , too , had shared a secret , the secret of knowing everything that was happening and not saying . When her Thursday visits came to an end a way of life would finish for him also , for Rose knew that Mr. Azam would not just come to the house and march upstairs while the old cuckold sighed and blinked . That would not be : all of it had to do with pretense , and deception of a kind . " I 'm sorry , " she had wanted to say , but could not . She did not know why she would have given anything not to have blurted out so much in the Box Tree Cafe . She longed to share his confidences with him , but had betrayed him even before he offered them . In the lovers ' bedroom she saw Mrs. Bouverie close her eyes in ecstasy while the gooseberry fool was finished and Jason spoke of a function he had attended , how one man had gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table . " Do n't go yet . Oh , love , do n't go , " Mrs. Bouverie pleaded , and Mr. Azam said he did n't ever want to go . <p> Across the table , all that was in his face , as so much had been when he gave the man a name and later when he said he minded . It was there behind the spectacles , in the tired skin touched with two crimson wine-blurs above the cheekbones . They shared it , yet they did not . Their sharing was a comfort for him , yet the comfort was as false as his wife 's voice on the stairs . <p> " All right , dear ? " her mother asked again , and by way of response Rose reached out for her coffee . <p> A frown began to knit Mr. Dakin 's forehead . Because of it Jason coughed and touched his face with a handkerchief , then folded it into his top pocket and began again about the function he had attended , referring to a commercial prospect he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dakin tidied the surface up , murmuring to Mr. Bouverie that probably he 'd never guess she 'd been shy herself at Rose 's age . <p> " I 'm confident we 'll pick it up , " Jason said . " I 'll write tomorrow , see if we ca n't clinch . " <p> Mrs. Bouverie clung to her lover , saying no this could n't be the last time , sobbing over him , noisily exclaiming that something better was their due . But Mr. Azam only shook his head . He was not a man to cause a wife who had borne his children to suffer . " We have our dignity , you and I , " he said . " We have been given this much . " Mr. Azam drew on his green shirt and brushed his hair with her hairbrush , and saw that the lipstick smears were gone . " I saw the pupil once , " he said , but the woman he spoke to had turned her face to the wall . <p> " Sounds promising , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say . " <p> Mrs. Dakin poured more coffee . She spoke of names , how it had struck her this afternoon that names can inspire the quality they suggest . She described a Prudence she had known when she was Rose 's age , and a Verity . " Remember Ernest Calavor ? " she prompted Mr. Dakin , and he said yes indeed . Bitter chocolates were passed round in a slim red box . When she 'd refused one Rose offered it across the table to Mr. Bouverie . <p> " Thank you , Rose . " <p> The lover 's footsteps were on the stairs , and then the front door closed and he was gone . <p> " It 's been so good of you , " Mr. Bouverie said . " So very kind of you to have me . " <p> " I hope your wife  --  " Mrs. Dakin began . <p> " She was so sorry to miss an evening out . " <p> " There 'll be another time . We 'll keep in touch . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cheers us no end . " <p> The old man hesitated before he rose to go . Had he not done so Rose might not have wept . But Mr. Bouverie hesitated and Rose wept to exclamations of concern , and fuss and embarrassment , while Mr. Bouverie stood awkwardly . She wept for his silent suffering , for his having to accept a distressing invitation because of her mother 's innocent insistence . She wept for the last golden opportunity the occasion provided for two other people , for the woman whose sinning caused her in the end to turn her face to the wall , for the man duty-bound to a wife . She wept for the modus vivendi that was left in the house no pupil or lover would visit again , for the glimpse she had had of it , enough to allow her a betrayal . She wept for her friends  --  for the unfaithful when things turned stale , and for the accident-prone ; for the romantic , who gave too much , and the mistrustful . She wept for the brittle surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolliness , and Jason settling into a niche . She wept for all her young life before her , and other glimpses and other betrayals . <p> William Trevor 's most recent book is Two Lives : Reading Turgenev ; My House in Umbria ( Viking ) . <p>
