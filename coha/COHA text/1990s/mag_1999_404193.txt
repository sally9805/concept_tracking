Why do millions of anglers chase redfish ? Because they 're one of the gamest inshore saltwater species you can fish for . // IMAGINE A TIME WHEN GULF redfish prowled the salt from North Carolina , around Florida , and all the way to South Texas . The deep , golden schools of reds covered acres of water as the aggressive fish patrolled inshore flats , grass beds , channel edges , and oyster bars . That time is now . The redfish , one of the greatest lightand medium-tackle saltwater gamefish in the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico , attracts millions of fishermen of all persuasions . The fish , also known as channel bass or red drum , can be taken on heavy bait rigs in the pounding surf , on jigs and other lures in channels and inlets , and on flies in the grassy flats . They grow to tremendous proportions-the world record , taken in North Carolina in 1984 , weighed 94 pounds 2 ounces-but a 5- pound redfish on an 8-weight fly rod or a 12-pound-test spinning outfit will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always win . Luckily , anglers can still take advantage of this fine fishery . This was n't always the case ; in fact , redfish were once in trouble-big trouble . THE REDFISH BATTLE The Gulf of Mexico red drum fishery nearly collapsed-twice in the past quarter century-because of brazen , unapologetic commercial overharvest . Reds demonstrated remarkable resilience to that adversity , however , and responded positively to conservationists ' efforts on their behalf . About 20 years ago , almost two dozen Texans met in a Houston tackle shop to discuss commercial abuses in local waters and map out a solution . Veteran FIELD &; STREAM contributing editor Bob Brister , an avid sport fisherman as well as a shotgunning expert , was at that meeting . ( Brister 's September 1981 story in FIELD &; STREAM , " Winning the War on Netters , " was among the first to shed national light on the dangers to red fish . ) He was there , too , four years later , when the fledgling Gulf Coast Conservation Association ( now the Coastal Conservation Association , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant gamefish status to reds had been signed into state law . Gill nets and other devastating gear types would no longer be allowed for redfish harvest . Conservationists helped redfish again in the early 1980s , when a recipe for seared or " blackened " redfish by New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme became popular in thousands of restaurants , creating a huge demand for spawningclass reds . It was only when spotter planes and purse seines had nearly wiped out critical brood stocks , fish as old as 30 years , that federal manK agers listened to conservationists ' pleas and enacted rules to shut down that relentless haul . Strict recreational limits and severely restricted commercial harvest have helped the redfish recover . The creation of hatcheries-built with help and generous financial support from CCA-to supplement natural production also aided the cause . In Texas , two such facilities produce 30 million-plus redfish fingerlings and many times more fry every year for release in state water . Many are lost to predators . Some , within a few short years , are caught by sportsmen . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open Gulf , where they become integral parts of this ongoing success story . Photograph Redfish taken on a fly outside of Rockport , Texas . // Following are updates on the major redfish fisheries in the U.S. TEXAS The 10-gallon brag along Texas ' 700-plus miles of coastline is that you " ca n't throw a rock without hitting a redfish . " Bold talk . Make that rock a live shrimp , however , and you might have a chance-fishing has been that good . While all of the state 's major bay systems , inlets , and Gulf beaches can be highly productive , Texas boasts three classic shallow-water venues . From north to south ( and with due respect for " fishy " water around every other launch ramp from the Sabine River to the Rio Grande ) , they are Port O'Connor , Rockport , and Port Mansfield . Look hard enough , and you can find deep holes and channels at any of these three ports , but the majority of fishing for reds at each takes place over traditional , grassy flats or along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom . Wading , drifting , and poling are equally effective , although locals have developed a strong preference for getting out of the boat and stalking these hard-fighting fish on foot . Overall , redfish action usually is better in the morning hours , before wind whips up a chop and clutters the surface with lure-snagging strands of grass . Soft plastics and gold spoons are the foundation on which every redfish tackle box is built . Any color plastic might draw fire , but a half dozen each of strawberry/white and pearl/chartreuse tails-with an appropriate stash of - and 1/8-ounce jigheads-will suffice often as not . Alongside the spoons and jigs in most boxes now rest as many floating plugs , such as the Top Dog , Super Spook , Ghost , Chug Bug , and Spittin ' Image . Surface lures did n't see much redfish duty in the past ; anglers had no patience for or confidence in aiming high-riding lures at bottom-feeding fish . True to their body styling , big reds lack the predatory surface accuracy of a snook or speckled trout . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-which often triggers an even more violent hit when the lure splashes back down . This topwater-lure craze led to flyfishing , and all three ports offer tremendous potential for the long rod . Pack a box with small poppers , Clousers , and an assortment of imitation shrimp in several colors . Sight-casting to reds is about as good as inshore fishing gets in Texas . Kneel low , and you can spot the upturned tails of fish rooting through the grass for tiny crustaceans and baitfish . Stand tall on a casting platform , and you can pick out the torpedo shapes of reds idling on the edges of sand holes in the grass beds . Whether you can see them or not , the redfish are there . So long as you 're on the water in Texas , cast with confidence . Footnote For more information , contact : Silver King Adventures , Galveston , 409 935-7242 . Capt .

In a bedroom hardly bigger than the full bed it contained , Kate Kinzler was waking up . Pinned down by the sandbags of her husband 's limbs , she closed her eyes again , but the dream came back : she was barreling through a grocery-store parking lot , inexplicably fast-45 , 50 mph . She was stomping on the brakes to no effect when a sleek brown Thoroughbred stepped into the aisle , in front of her . A smash of glass and metal , and his body flew through the air . She saw it through the sunroof , impossibly high and falling toward her fast . When she managed to wrestle the car to a stop , he had cracked the pavement , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dim ceiling . If she fell back asleep , it would go on , get worse . Her dreams often ended in catastrophes of her own making . She woke up most mornings wound tight and careful , trying not to live out any of her dreams . <p> It was a Sunday , six a.m . Late March , though through the window it still looked like February-lead gray and barren , with sparse piles of snow lining the streets . The trees were budless and black . Next to her , Stuart was giving off a faint snore , huffing out traces of rum . They 'd thrown a party last night , and now the tiny bedroom was littered with dirty clothes and half-empty beer bottles . Stale smoke wafted in from the living room , which was a mess of spills and dirty dishes . They were twenty-nine , full grown , seven years out of college . And still living like this . <p> She peeled herself out from under Stuart , trying not to look at him . His snoring stopped for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the pile of clothes she put on a sweatshirt and a pair of socks , and pulled her long , frizzy red curls into a knot on the top of her head . Muscling open the window , she crawled out onto the porch roof , a mild slope of black tar with cigarette butts scattered around , dropped from the window above by the three college guys who rented the attic apartment . She kicked them toward the gutters and sat down against the wall , drawing her arms and knees up into the sweatshirt . <p> They lived on Packard Street , at the edge of the student neighborhood strewn with plastic cups and abandoned couches . It was just a few blocks from the dorms they 'd lived in as undergrads , and just thirty miles from the Detroit suburb where she 'd grown up . <p> " Hey . " Stuart stuck his head out the window . <p> His sandy , curly hair was mussed , his brown eyes still half-lidded with sleep . He had their blue comforter wrapped around his shoulders , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes on hers as if performing a magic trick in which everything except her disappeared from the world . <p> This was how he got her . Suddenly she thought of Bloody Marys and breakfast , a shower and sex and a morning in bed . <p> But then it took him two tries to squeeze through the window-he was thin , but clumsy and tall , and plainly still drunk . He dragged their new blanket across the damp , dirty tar and plopped down next to her with a thud that shook the porch . She pulled away . This was how it went lately : her rushes of feeling for him were so brief , so fragile . <p> " What time did you come to bed ? " she said . <p> " I do n't know . After three ? Oh , you missed it-Billy told this story about when he was studying abroad in St. Petersburg- " <p> " And got beat up by the cops ? " <p> " How 'd you know that ? " <p> " And had to sneak out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded incredulously . <p> Billy had been telling that story for years . They 'd been hanging out with the same friends-mostly Stuart's-since college . They got drunk and had the same conversations over and over . <p> " I never heard it , " Stuart said , mystified . <p> Kate sat quietly , watching the cars move up and down along Packard Street , a 30 mph zone that never cleared out . To the Laundromat . The food co-op . To church , to breakfast , to Kinko 's . Each car probably filled with pairs of mad , wild lovers . <p> " Do I have to go to your folks ' today ? " he said after a while . <p> It was her dad 's birthday . " Nah . If you do the laundry ? " <p> " Deal . " <p> " Deal . " <p> He fell sideways in relief until his head landed in her lap , heavy as a bowling ball . <p> " What 's the matter ? " <p> " Nothing , " she said . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you dream ? " <p> She tilted her head away as politely as possible . <p> She had tried drinking , exercising , pills from her doctor-for anxiety , for depression , for sleep . She had tried buying things , cooking , reading books . She had tried telling herself everyone probably felt this way about their partner sooner or later . But she did n't believe it . No one had ever admitted such a thing to her . <p> They watched a college-age couple carrying duffel bags into the Laundromat across the street . The girl gave the guy a bump on the ass with her bag , and he stumbled and laughed , then held the door for her . The cars hissed past on the street , a white noise that you forgot about inside , though it was always there , if you listened . <p> " You should just skip your parents ' , " he said . " You always get this way when you go there . And then depressed after . Always .

Whenever her mind got soft or sleepy , she snapped off a single hair at the root and felt herself spring to attention . She 'd lined up an almost perfect column of A 's on her transcript . And whenever she got scared about her lack of a plan for life after graduation , she pulled out her transcript and felt her heart slow down . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
