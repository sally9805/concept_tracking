Presiding over one of his famously incongruous assemblages of guests on a recent evening , Bill Maher got on the subject of failed second-term presidencies . On the panel that night was Charlton Heston , who casually inserted that Ronald Reagan " won the cold war " during his last years in office . Maher 's blood pressure started to mountain-climb . " He won the cold war ? Please ! This was strictly a Reagan project ? ... I would say Vietnam was the biggest thing that won the cold war ... " The conversation shifted but Maher 's mind did n't . Later he cut off one of his other guests , turned back to Heston and intoned , " Vietnam . You do n't think Vietnam ... " The host of Politically Incorrect ( ABC late-night Monday-Friday ) was worked up . <P> Worked up is n't a state we often find late-night network talk-show hosts in , unless , of course , they happen to be in the presence of Isabella Rossellini 's cheekbones . Affecting neither David Letterman 's iconically apathetic cool nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly large audience to his witty roundtable show , which left its original home , Comedy Central , last November . <P> Since debuting on ABC in January , PI has built such a following that it now beats The Late Show with David Letterman in the 17 major cities where the shows go head to head . In areas where PI follows Nightline , the show holds on to an impressive 75% of Ted Koppel 's audience . And PI is sure to gain more momentum when ABC airs it live during prime time over the next four Thursdays ( 10 E.T. ) . <P> Maher , a stand-up comic and the son of an NBC news editor , conceived the show as a nightly dream salon in which discourse on the day 's events boiled but never simmered . Critics of PI have lamented that the show , like Crossfire or The McLaughlin Group , too often turns into a forum of white noise where few substantive ideas are presented . This seems akin to disliking Jenny McCarthy because she does n't do Strindberg . Half hours of current-affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring guest  --  are not meant to leave us feeling as though we 've sat down with an issue of Tikkun . <P> In essence PI is a game show with guests competing for the title of most wry . This free-market environment , though , does not guarantee that the show is always funny . Often whole episodes go by without any amusing moments occurring apart from Maher 's opening monologue ( which a team of comedy writers produces ) or the mere sight of people like G. Gordon Liddy and rapper Coolio seated together . <P> At a time when stars and politicians seem more painstakingly packaged than ever , and it is all too easy to find the same person recounting the same tired anecdote on the Rosie O'Donnell Show , on Entertainment Tonight and in the pages of Vanity Fair , PI 's appeal lies in the fact that it offers us the rare hope of seeing celebrated figures break through their wrapping . PI is at its best when panelists become slightly unhinged , when they start behaving like Ricki Lake guests in higher tax brackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven Bochco and ranted , quite seriously , that people should be reading Thomas Hardy instead of watching TV.
