THERE 'S GOOD NEWS FOR anybody worried that the Dole rebound will mean a dull presidential race . Though he has n't made up his mind , Ross Perot is leaning toward taking another run at it . Once again , he sees an opportunity and a rationale . Budget balancing , term limits and the reform of Medicare and Social Security are all stalled in Congress or neglected , so far , as campaign issues . So Perot told the Washington Post last week that while he would prefer to stay in private life , " I can not live with myself knowing what these problems are and seeing the people in government not facing these problems . " <P> As he did four years ago , when he got 19% of the vote , Perot could make chaos theory the best predictor of November 's outcomes . A new TIME/CNN poll indicates that in a three-way race held now , Perot would get 14% of the vote , Clinton 46% and Dole 33% . Perot 's presence would draw more votes from Dole ( 7 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , White House strategists are worried about a Candidate Perot who aims most of his fire , as he did in 1992 , at the incumbent President . <P> Given the progress of this year 's Republican primaries , it 's easy to see why Perot would be tempted to move . Buchanan talks like him , bashing NAFTA and GATT , while Forbes spends like him , powering his campaign with his own plentiful cash . And both of them claim the status of political outsider that was crucial to Perot 's strength four years ago . For a man with the Texas billionaire 's robust self-regard , it ca n't be much fun to watch stand-ins play the role he wrote for himself . <P> In particular , the collapse of Buchanan 's prospects leaves an opening for Perot to collect some of Pat Buchanan 's radically unhappy constituents with their concerns about wage stagnation and job security . But first these voters have to find Perot 's Reform Party . For now it is guaranteed a ballot spot in just four states : California , North Dakota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen states , independent parties already on the ballot , most of them spin-offs from the ' 92 Perot campaign , are expected to merge with the Reform Party . And Perot lieutenants are pressing petition drives elsewhere . The party is likely to appear on a total of about three dozen state ballots . <P> Perot says he hopes that the party 's nominee will be a fresh face . High on his wish list are David Boren of Oklahoma and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut , both of whom served as Governor and Senator ; former Missouri Senator John Danforth ; and retiring Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia . But anyone the party chooses will face spending limits , unless it is Perot , who by law can spend all he pleases on his own candidacy . That may be enough to decide who gets the Reform Party nod when it holds its convention in late summer . Do n't be surprised if it 's a scrappy little guy with a Texas accent . <P>  --  By Laurence I.Barrett/Washington            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
