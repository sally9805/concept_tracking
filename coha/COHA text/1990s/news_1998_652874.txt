<p> ON A RARE DAY WHEN THE AMERICAN Ambassador 's residence in Paris is empty of foreign dignitaries and visiting heads of state , it is so still that the normally inaudible sounds of white-gloved servants scurrying across the marble floors can be heard . Filtering through tall arched windows overlooking formal gardens , sunlight illuminates the stately rooms of this vast 19th-century mansion , glinting off gilded wall paneling , ornamented mirrors , Baccarat chandeliers and 17th- and 18th-century furnishings . <p> It seems an improbable setting for austere modern art like Ellsworth Kelly 's spare monochrome canvases or Willem de Kooning 's late ribbon-style paintings . But here they are . And in the building 's Old World splendor , these unsentimental and occasionally ironic paintings and sculpture by 20th-century American masters look unexpectedly right . <p> Under Felix Rohatyn , the international financier who was named American Ambassador to France last August , and his wife , Elizabeth , the Ambassador 's residence is now an outpost for modern American art . Gone are the French modernists  --  van Gogh , Cezanne and Derain  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early last year , had showcased . <p> The residence currently features an Impressionist-style flag painting by Childe Hassam , early quasi-abstract works by Arthur Dove and Georgia O'Keeffe , and surrealist collaged boxes by Joseph Cornell . The collection also contains Abstract Expressionist works , Pop Art , Color Field painting and even contemporary feminist pieces by Louise Bourgeois and Cindy Sherman . And should there be any residual doubt that the residence , near the Place de la Concorde on Rue Faubourg Saint-Honore , is a tribute to American culture , a 1955 Jasper Johns flag painting will soon be installed in the entry hall where flags of the United States and the State Department stand . <p> Ambassador and Mrs. Rohatyn , longtime figures on the New York political and cultural scene , chose modern art because , to them , it represented America 's great contribution to art history . Although the Rohatyns ' personal tastes are traditional and European  --  inclined toward 18th-century French and Italian art as well as Impressionism  --  they said they were " excited " about living with modern art for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy expression of American culture , " Mr. Rohatyn said , " and one that our friends in France are interested in . This is just the right kind of Government support for American art . " <p> It is also a gesture that American artists appreciate . " The American Government is a bad client , " said the artist Brice Marden , referring to Federal cuts in spending on the arts . " So it 's great that Rohatyn did this . " <p> Mr. Marden 's 1988 painting " Couplet IV , " an open-weave pattern of tangled yellow and blue lines , looks majestic in the Louis XVI salon , a reception room decorated with intertwining gold-leaf wall motifs that the painting 's composition subtly echoes . " Art can be a powerful political expression , " said Mr. Marden , who has lent the work to the embassy . " Politicians are acknowledging that and using it to their advantage . " <p> Indeed , the installation , which will eventually include two dozen works , expresses artistic links between the United States and France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bond between the French and American people , " said a State Department official in the Arts in Embassies program , a Government division established in 1974 to assist ambassadors in dealing with the red tape involved in borrowing art from museums , galleries , collectors and artists . <p> ONCE THE ROHATYN APPOINTMENT WAS announced , an Arts in Embassies curator contacted the Ambassador about assembling a collection . The Rohatyns consulted with their daughter-in-law Jeanne Greenberg , a 30-year-old New York art adviser and curator , and came up with a list of 40 favorite artists they wanted for the embassy residence . The Arts in Embassies staff then handled the nuts and bolts of the loans . <p> " Having American art in Paris gives us a new context to think about these works and , in some cases , how bound American modernism is to the European tradition , " Ms. Greenberg said . She will also oversee the installation catalogue , which will include essays by Robert Rosenblum , a professor of fine art at New York University , and Michael Plante , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modernism goes , Paris was the hub of the art world in the West before World War II , New York the epicenter afterward . But this bipolar history is much too simple . To suggest a more accurate and complicated history of shared artistic heritage , the Rohatyns , at Ms. Greenberg 's suggestion , have selected works by 20th-century American artists who either lived and worked in France or were deeply influenced by French art . <p> Edward Hopper , a quintessentially American painter known for his prewar New England landscapes and lone figures in melancholy interiors , made crucial trips to Paris in 1907 , 1909 and 1910 . A quartet of his paintings , executed during this period and depicting Paris street scenes and bridges , was borrowed from the Whitney Museum of American Art and now hangs in the residence 's blue room . On his first visit to Paris , Hopper was struck by the light and rapid , delicate brushwork of the Impressionists , and these , in turn , affected his own stylistic development . " It seemed awfully crude and raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to the United States . " It took me 10 years to get over Europe . " <p> Despite the myth of American art  --  free from the " weight of European culture , " as Barnett Newman wrote in 1948  --  many American artists made pilgrimages to Paris , lured by the mystique of the avant-garde . <p> " One does n't think of American artists going to Paris after World War II , " explained Mr. Plante , who is the author of a forthcoming book , " Paris ' Verdict : American Artists in France 1946 to 1958 . " " But a very interesting group went there , working off the myth of Paris and of Gertrude Stein . In the 1950 's , one critic said 300 American painters and sculptors were living and working in Paris after the war . " <p> Among the postwar American artists whose work bears the imprint of France is Mr. Kelly , who lived in Paris from 1948 to 1954 . There , he painted " Fete a Torcy , " a geometric abstraction striated into horizontal yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist , in the Louis XVI salon adjacent to Mr. Marden 's calligraphic image using the same palette . <p> The title of Mr. Kelly 's painting was the result of charming happenstance , inadvertently pointing to the fine line , and at times imperceptible distinction , between abstraction and decorative art . " I was staying in a villa in Torcy , a small farming village outside Paris , when I painted the picture in the summer of 1952 , " Mr. Kelly recalled . " I put it up against a wall outside the villa alongside a road because people from the Galerie Maeght were coming to see it . A farmer came by in a horse-drawn cart with his son , who asked , ' What is that ? ' The farmer grumbled , ' It 's for the fete a Torcy , ' which is a late-summer festival . The farmer did n't know it was a painting , but I thought it was a great name . " <p> The French influence has lasted throughout Mr. Kelly 's career . His 1971 " Chatham V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a minimalist painting composed of oversize , Legolike components  --  a blue square and red rectangle set at right angles to form an inverted L. Commenting on the work , Mr. Kelly observed , " My paintings have a quality of proportion that I owe very much to Paris , to the architecture , the layout of the city , Hausmann 's designs and the way the facades are conceived . " <p> Mr. Marden 's early work also owes much to French architectural facades . After finishing graduate school in 1964 , he spent several months in Paris , where he began his suave monochrome paintings , layering oil paint and wax , creating sensuous , skinlike surfaces . <p> " At the time , de Gaulle was freshening up Paris , " the artist recalled . " Watching the walls being plastered was important to my work . They were washing the walls , restuccoing a lot of the buildings , smoothing the planes . Drips of paint were accumulating at the bottom of the buildings . I started letting the drips accumulate at the bottom of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of all the works in the residence , Roy Lichtenstein 's 1984 " Paintings : Picasso 's Head " most clearly addresses the historical rapport and friendly competition between American and French artists . As a homage to Picasso and de Kooning , two titans of modernism , Lichtenstein bisected his canvas into punchy , stylized appropriations of a Picasso portrait of one of his mistresses and a gestural abstraction by de Kooning . Coexisting on the same plane , the dual images imply both the dialogue and rivalry between the schools of Paris and New York , in particular , de Kooning 's competition with Picasso , of whom the Abstract Expressionist said , " Picasso is the man to beat . " <p> After his visit to the residence , Mr. Rosenblum said : " The Lichtenstein painting pinpoints the trans-Atlantic Olympic match between the acknowledged leaders of the schools of Paris and New York . It 's a story that 's alive and well today . Long may both flags wave . "
