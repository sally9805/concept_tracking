<p> Latin America 's growing rivalry between the Roman Catholic Church and scores of Protestant churches has broken out into what 's being called a " holy war " here in Brazil . <p> The spark was a sacrilegious act by a Pentecostal pastor that was shown last month on national television . Thousands of outraged Catholic protesters took to the streets , bomb threats were made against Pentecostal churches , and both Pope John Paul II and Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called for tolerance . <p> But behind the incident lies a fundamental change taking place in Brazilian society : The rapid growth and spreading influence of Evangelical churches are threatening Brazil 's status as the world 's largest Roman Catholic country . <p> What ignited the recent uproar was the Rev. Sergio von Helde 's mistreatment of a ceramic image of Brazil 's patron saint , Our Lady of Aparecida . On the Sao Paulo-based television program " The Awakening of Faith , " the pastor of the Universal Church of The Kingdom of God repeatedly kicked and slapped the likeness , calling it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Catholic Church lies . This image ca n't do anything for you . " <p> The attack on Our Lady of Aparecida - a black version of the Virgin Mary - was the sharpest display to date of the increasing competition between the Catholic Church and Protestant churches . <p> About 110 million of Brazil 's 153 million inhabitants are Catholic , and Our Lady of Aparecida is to Brazil what Our Lady of Lourdes is to France or Our Lady of Fatima to Portugal . <p> In the weeks that followed Pastor Von Helde 's attack , thousands of outraged protesters demonstrated by carrying images of the aggrieved saint . Others surrounded Universal temples , screaming obscenities and throwing rocks , eggs , and tomatoes . In Rio de Janeiro , police were called to investigate several bomb threats against Universal temples . <p> From the Vatican , Pope John Paul II advised Brazilian Catholics " not to answer evil with evil . " In Rio , the Most Rev. Eugenio Sales , the Archbishop , told reporters " unless we control our emotions , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Latin American nations , the Brazilian evangelical movement has expanded rapidly , as millions of the poor flock to its churches seeking spiritual help for lives trapped in poverty or caught up in drugs and crime . <p> " Jesus Christ has transformed me . I was a drug addict , and now I do n't even drink any more , " says Pedro Noguera , an employee of Visao Nacional de Evangelizcao , one of Brazil 's largest nongovernmental organizations . Mr. Noguera converted to the Pentecostal Church five years ago . <p> In 1960 , Latin America had only 7 million Protestants . By 1990 , the number had reached 51 million , according to the Worldwide Evangelization Crusade . <p> In Peru , Bolivia , and Mexico , Protestant churches are growing between 7 and 9 percent a year . But in Brazil , Chile , and Guatemala - where they have made the most headway - between 20 and 50 percent of all Catholics have converted to Protestant denominations over the past 20 years , according to the Roman Catholic Conference of Latin Bishops . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 census showed that 89 percent of residents here described themselves as Catholic . But religious experts say that number has since dwindled to 70 percent of the population , while 20 percent , or about 30 million people , now call themselves evangelicals . The Catholic Church estimates that 600,000 of their faithful convert annually . <p> Recent press reports indicate that the evangelicals have surpassed the Catholics in numbers of pastors to priests ( 200,000 to 15,000 ) and in numbers of churches ( 100,000 to 45,000 ) . <p> Evangelicals have also been electing their own politicians . Currently , there are 27 federal deputies , 4 senators , 55 state deputies , some 125 mayors , and 4,000 city councilmen who ran as evangelical candidates . <p> By far the fastest growing sects in Latin America are the small , home-grown Pentecostal churches with little or no connections to foreign denominations , which disdain traditional Protestant branches and interpret the Bible literally . An estimated 70 to 80 percent of Latin Protestants belong to a Pentecostal church , according to the Latin America Evangelist , a Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Scriptures , catchy music , miraculous cures , and promises of a chance to become church organizers . <p> In Brazil , the fastest growing church is Von Helde 's Pentecostal Universal Church of The Kingdom of God . In the past five years , it has increased its membership by 280 percent , from 900,000 to 3.5 million followers , with 7,000 pastors and 2,100 temples , according to Veja newsmagazine . <p> The Universal Church was founded 18 years ago in a converted Rio mortuary by Edir Macedo , a former state lottery administrator and self-declared bishop . Mr. Macedo is known for his fiery sermons about the " war between God and the devil . " He preaches that faith can cure nearsightedness , cancer , and AIDS . <p> In Rio , a study by the Institute for Religious Studies notes that 9 out of 10 new city churches belong to Pentecostal denominations , which use an assortment of names such as the Quadrangular Gospel , God Is Love , Home of the Blessing , Signs and Prodigies , and Jesus Is Truth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paulo , suggests the poor are drawn to such sects out of their need to escape their harsh reality : " This type of emotional appeal is irresistible for people who have nothing to lose . " <p> Religious experts see other reasons for the Catholic Church 's inability to stem the Pentecostal advance . For years , the church hierarchy has been feuding between conservatives , who favor established traditions , and progressives , who follow liberation theology 's Marxist analysis of social and economic problems . <p> Even warnings by Pope John Paul II of evangelical " false images , " has n't had much effect . <p> Brazilian Catholics are also disenchanted with the lack of priests to go around and with what many describe as the church 's resistance to changing old-fashioned rituals to counteract evangelical sermons and slick marketing techniques used on television , radio , and in rock videos . <p> While some critics have dismissed Von Helde 's recent television performance as theatrics , his symbolic assault on the saint on Oct. 12 is the evangelical movement 's boldest challenge to the establishment religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady of Aparecida 's feast day and a national holiday , which is a source of resentment for the nation 's evangelicals . <p> The Brazilian government lost no time in taking sides . Sao Paulo prosecutors charged Von Helde - an ex-Catholic - with several violations , including " public discrimination and contempt against another religion , " and using the media to " incite religious discrimination , " which could earn him up to six years in prison . State Congressman Afanazio Jazadji asked officials to force the pastor to submit to a psychiatric examination . <p> In the nation 's capital , federal Congressman Paulo Paim asked the nation 's attorney general to charge Von Helde with racism , since Our Lady of Aparecida is Brazil 's only black saint . <p> President Cardoso also joined the fray . " Brazil is a democratic country known for its tolerance , " he said . " Any manifestation of intolerance wounds its spirit of unity as well as its Christian spirit . " <p> Yet Von Helde and other Universal pastors have long been giving stirring sermons against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also question Mary 's virginity and refer to the pope as " a false prophet " and the Vatican as " Babylonia . " <p> But never before had any pastor been brazen enough to attack Brazil 's most revered saint on network television . In fact , some observers believe the assault could be a mark of the church 's growing strength . <p> " It showed that the Universal Church now considers itself sufficiently strong enough to do what no other religion has ever done in Brazil - confront the Catholic Church , " says Veja . <p> Universal pastors preach that miracles depend not only on faith but the size of one 's financial contribution to the church . " If you do n't pay God , you pay the devil , " Macedo has often said . <p> Thanks to massive contributions , the Universal Church has purchased TV Record - the nation 's third largest television network with 47 broadcasting stations , 30 radio stations , two publishing houses , a bank , a recording studio , a newspaper , a furniture factory , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches in 46 countries , including 22 in the United States , where it has targeted the Hispanic population on Spanish cable-television stations . It even has its own political party in Portugal . <p> According to the Rio daily O Globo , the Universal Church is a $ 735 million a year enterprise , making Macedo the " CEO " of Brazil 's 34th-richest private company , ahead of such giants as Philip Morris and Goodyear . To administer his financial empire , the bishop is said to divide his time between homes in New York , Argentina , and South Africa . <p> As a result , Macedo has been the target of several criminal investigations for racketeering , charlatanism , and tax evasion . Marcio Thomaz Bastos , Macedo 's lawyer , insists his client has broken no laws and is a victim of " an inquisition . " <p> Meanwhile , Macedo has apologized to Brazilian Catholics for Von Helde 's actions . From his New York home , he said by telephone on TV Record that the pastor " acted like a child " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rubem Cesar Fernandes , a Rio-based anthropologist who has studied Brazil 's evangelical movement , believes the apology wo n't mollify most Catholics . In fact , he predicts the incident over Our Lady of Aparecida will have " a sobering effect in attracting new followers to the evangelical churches . People will now look at them in a different way . " <p> Even some fellow evangelicals have joined Macedo 's critics . " The Universal Church is the object of frequent embarrassment and shame for the evangelical population , " wrote the Brazilian Evangelical Association , a group representing 200 churches , in a recent statement announcing their break with the Universal Church . " Its practices impede others from becoming evangelists . " <p> Most certainly , the Catholic Church is not about to let the matter rest . Recently , several bishops have announced measures to curb evangelical expansion . <p> Catholic Church leaders say they will : expand Life Network , a television network that disseminates church programs ; initiate a three-year crusade to win over nonpracticing Catholics , estimated to be as high as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and change the emphasis of its liberation theology-inspired ecclesiastical base communities - neighborhood religious groups - by stressing self-fulfillment , youth , antidrug efforts , and women in society .
