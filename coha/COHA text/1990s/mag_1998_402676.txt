Some companies do it right . Some do it wrong . None of their actions go unnoticed . // HOW DOES A PC VENDOR earn your loyalty ? Competitive prices are obviously a plus , but price alone wo n't make you a longtime customer . Service is what counts . ( I do n't know about you , but I do n't think I 've ever bought a software program or a critical piece of hardware solely because of its price . ) Great service can take many forms . It can be a demonstrated commitment to providing high-quality technical support and repair services . It can mean testing software fully to ensure that the final released product is bug-free ( or as close to that ideal as possible ) . It can mean introducing innovative new services that offer customers greater choice . These types of customer-first policies and practices are what earn companies sainthood in this annual look at the year in review . And the sinners ? These are the companies whose buggy products or poor service-or combination of both-have left customers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave customers feeling frustrated , ignored , and angry . You may notice that this year 's listing of saints includes several organizations outside the computer industry . As we move ever further into the brave new world of Web-based computing , these watchdog groups play an invaluable role in ensuring that the needs and rights of consumers remain paramount . Their efforts deserve our thanks and support . Microsoft . Many at Microsoft will forever remember 1998 as the year Bill Gates went head-to-head with Attorney General Janet Reno . But many computer users will remember it as the year Microsoft released a steady stream of buggy products and tried to tame glitches in previous releases . First there was Internet Explorer 4.0 , with its much  --  publicized security holes that allowed Web hackers to view data on individual hard drives . Then came a procession of often small but annoying bugs . And instead of a straightforward patch , Microsoft issued the Internet Explorer Service Pack 1-then left it up to customers to figure out if they needed to install it . Thanks for the help . Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headaches for consumers concemed incompatibilities between existing hardware and software and the upgraded OS . Just about all the leading notebook manufacturers reported incompatibilities with Win 98 . And glitches with Office 97 compelled Microsoft to issue not one , but two service releases . Unfortunately , the releases were n't cumulative , so users had to install both updates to take advantage of all the fixes and work-arounds . Netscape Communications . Netscape earned sainthood last year for holding its own in the browser war against Microsoft . One year later , the company-and its award-winning browser-are still going strong , keeping significant market share while continuing to offer enhancements to customers . Netscape is also commended for embracing the open source code model with Navigator 5. o-a move that lets all developers improve and debug Navigator . Even if opening the code was just a strategy to survive Microsoft 's aggressive marketing , the result is great news for users . lomega . First Iomega dug itself out from under a class action suit ( and bad consumer feelings ) related to customer service and support . Customers complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later being charged excessive amounts for those calls . Then the company found itself in the midst of a brand-new controversy , the so-called Click of Death . Iomega acknowledged last February that the clicking sound in a small number of Zip drives could signify that some or all Zip disks are unreadable-bad news for folks who 'd used them to store valuable data . Iomega initially refused to replace faulty drives that were more than one year old , but it has now dropped that time limit . Dell , Gateway , and Micron . Thousands of motorists choose to lease a vehicle rather than buy a new car every few years . Now , thanks to two of these leading computer makers  --  Dell and Micron-consumers can lease their next PC . These lease programs are n't the cheapest way to move up to state-of-the-art , but for the cash-strapped , credit-card poor among us , they offer a hedge against the never-ending battle to stay current with the latest technology . // Gateway , too , deserves praise for its innovative YourWare program , which , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for their computer in low monthly installments . Another advantage of YourWare : After two years consumers can trade the computer in ( at fair market value ) for a new model . Maximus Computers . This Southem California company presents so many reasons to be included in the sinners category , it 's hard to know where to begin . First , there were charges early in the year that customers had received unlicensed software with their Maximus computers . ( See last February s PCW Advocate ; Maximus officials said at that time that the installation of unlicensed software was " a mistake . " ) Then came a stream of complaints about obtaining service and support from the mail-order company . At this writing , Maximus is under investigation by the Florida attorney general 's office for not providing either the on-site service or the 24-hour technical support that it had promised customers . Better Business Bureau . Thanks to BBBOnLine , consumers can shop on the Web with confidence , knowing that any merchant whose site bears the familiar BBB logo has passed a thorough inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBBOnLine seal of approval , a company must meet a number of requirements , including participating in an arbitration program to resolve customer complaints . Unfortunately for consumers , relatively few companies ( only 1750 to date ) are taking advantage of this service . The E-Commerce industry . With a few notable exceptions , Web merchants have ignored calls for self-restraint in their rampant collecting of personal information online . According to a June 1998 report by the Federal Trade Commission , 92 percent of all commercial Web sites collect personal information about consumers , while only 14 percent offer any type of notice about their data collection practices-including a straightforward , easily located privacy policy . Faced with federal controls , the e-commerce industry is arguing that self  --  regulation , not legislation , is the best way to protect consumer privacy . Sorry folks : It 's too little , too late . Federal Trade Commission . The FTC earns major kudos for speaking out for consumers on two critical online issues : the proliferation of junk e-mail , and the furtive collection of personal information by Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to investigate solutions to the spam scourge , the FTC conducted a comprehensive survey of Web sites last spring , and subsequently called for federal legislation to govern the collection of information from children online . Now , if only Congress would do its part . Center for Media Education . CME has provided a constant voice of reason in the ongoing battle to protect the privacy of online consumers . This Washington , D.C. , watchdog group was at the vanguard when it sounded the alarm about online marketing and advertising aimed at children with the release of its groundbreaking 1996 report , Web of Deception . The organization continues to advocate tirelessly for children 's rights , educating the public on this critical issue and pushing Congress to adopt legislation governing the collection of data from children who are online . Detwiler Foundation 's Computers for Schools Program . Since its founding in 1991 , this San Diego-based organization has placed more than 40,000 computers in public and private schools . With the help of some key private-sector grants and through an innovative cooperative effort with the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers ) , the foundation has expanded its efforts to more than a dozen states . Many more states are scheduled to sign on in the coming year . The PC industry . Despite all the predictions of data loss and other dire consequences , software ( and hardware ) companies have failed to devise industrywide standards for handling the year 2000 problem ( when computers may misread dates ) . Instead , consumers and businesses alike will have to deal with a multitude of different fixes , even among different versions of the same application . For example , the fix in Microsoft Excel 7 does not match the remedy in Excel 97 , raising the potential for untold headaches and data corruption for users who need to work with a file in both versions of Excel .
