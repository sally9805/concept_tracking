PT : You 're probably one of the most famous , if not the most famous , editors in the country , and have been for the last 15 to 20 years . HGB : I 'm always afraid that what I have is going to be taken away from me . But that is a great motivator . I 've been looking over my shoulder here at Cosmopolitan for 29 years . I 've been running scared for 29 years . PT : With all the professional , personal , and presumably financial success you 've had , why are you insecure ? HGB : Nothing recedes like success . You absolutely can not count on it sticking around unless you take measures to see that it does so . You can not coast . It does n't work . I would n't dare take anything for granted . I have the best staff in the world , but what I really should do is work harder in order to continue to keep having it happen . Part of my success , if I may , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always make money for your publisher ? HGB : Tina Brown , the editor of The New Yorker and former editor of Vanity Fair , is possibly the most brilliant editor in the world . I could n't begin to do what she does . She could n't do what I do either , but she would n't want to . She 's just formidable . But there 's something I do that she does n't , which is make money for her publisher . I do n't think Vanity Fair ever got into the black . Maybe a tiny touch . The New Yorker loses millions of dollars a year . That does n't mean she 's a bad editor , but when you 're toting up the qualifications of a successful editor , that would be one of them , and Cosmo 's a little gold mine . I think that 's just super . Cosmo makes money because it 's good . PT : What would you describe as your biggest success and your biggest failure ? HGB : The biggest success in my professional life , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this for 29 years . The next biggest success is my first book , Sex and the Single Girl ( Avon ; 1962 ) , from which Cosmo stemmed . There would n't be any new Cosmo if it had n't been for that book . I 've written three other books . I consider them very satisfactory . All but my last book , The Late Show ( William Morrow ; 1993 ) , which is about how I hate getting older , have been on best-seller lists . My biggest failure is that I really ca n't assimilate all this and be as grateful for it as I should be . All I can do is be very fearful that it 's going to disappear pretty soon , which it will because of how old I am . Is n't it a shame that I ca n't just be thrilled and happy that I have had this wonderful magazine and a terrific husband ? We 're both healthy ; we 've done okay financially . Why ca n't I be happy about that ? I really ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't call myself a happy person . I would call myself a realized person , a very grateful person for all the wonderful things that have happened to me . I have moments of great pleasure . I know how to have fun . I enjoy sensual pleasures . I can think of people who are day-to-day more tranquil than I. Happy is a very strong word . PT : Women 's magazines are an important socializing force among young women . Men , perhaps , are the poorer for not having them . These magazines create a community among women , and you certainly help foster that sense of intimacy by inviting women to " step into my parlor " 12 times a year . What messages do you try to give women through Cosmo . HGB : Work and love . These are the most important things in Life . They always have been ; they always will be . I believe Sigmund Freud said that . The readers of Cosmopolitan are young women 18 to 34 , and it is important for them to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own identity . These facts have n't changed in the 29 years that I have been editing Cosmopolitan . These are the things that make us who we are . PT : You get criticized for calling the female sex " girls " in Cosmo . But there are some who insist the reference be to Cosmo " women . " HGB : I absolutely have not changed on that and I do n't plan to . By the time you reach the age of 23 , you 're a grown-up . You can think seriously about men , about having children . But at the same time it is important to retain the qualities of being a girl  --  remain enthusiastic , playful , have fun . I do n't think that side of a woman ever stops . A woman can enjoy being a girl and can enjoy the power of being a woman also . PT : Do you feel like one of the girls , or like their mother ? What chronological age do you see yourself as ? HGB : I just do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the girls . I feel that a woman is both girlish and womanly as long as she lives , and I 'm not that different from the girl hanging out with her girlfriends in Little Rock , Arkansas , or at high school in Los Angeles . There is just no way that I can believe I 'm the real age that I am . It does n't work . It 's not acceptable . I think older age is just the pits , but you have to be some kind of nut case to assume that you 're escaping it . So I escape it as best I can , through my work . PT : You never mention anything but women and aging in Cosmo . HGB : That 's because the women read this magazine are 18 to 34 . They are not yet concerned with that . But I do n't have a kind word to say about age . It 's awful . PT : How do you think women have changed in the past 30 years ? HGB : Women now lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lovers and mothers and workers . They know they can be executives and wear mascara . One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other . They do n't cancel each other out . I 'm fond of remembering that I used to have sex all to myself . That was wonderful because other women 's magazines would n't go near the subject . PT : Do you like sharing it ? HGB : Uh-uh . PT : Cosmo has been accused of being " fluffy . " HGB : It absolutely is not . Women are interested in hearing about what 's going on in their lives . It helps a woman to have more power in the workplace . What you have to do to et ahead is hard work . You ca n't sleep your way up in the workplace . You ca n't charm your way up . A woman has to earn it . PT : You provoke strong reactions among women . Why ? HGB : I 'm very level and try to report what 's really happening . I deal in reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things that I say , for some reason , are controversial . What I just said about old age being the pits , maybe people do n't want to hear that . Older women assume that Cosmo and I are leading their daughters astray . We are n't , but the people who are the most critical never read Cosmo . They do n't know what 's going inside . Cosmo is a very honorable magazine . We say do your own work , do n't live off of anybody else , do n't be a parasite , make your own money , use your talent , live up to your potential . That , to me , is a very moral message , and that 's in every page of Cosmo . I have always said married men can b a viable part of a single woman 's life . Well , that goes over like a boulder . It is n't the end of the world if you have affair with a married man . There are a lot of married women who do n't want to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think people cheat on each other because they fall out of love . People do n't want to hear that either . I just try to say the truth , and it 's unpalatable to some people . On the other hand , that does n't make me not say it . I 'm not reporting what 's supposed to be out there . I 'm talking about what 's really going on , so let 's deal with it . PT : We know that women have changed in the past 30 years . How have men changed . Or have they not ? HGB : Men have been influenced by women because they 're the only other sex ; they are very vulnerable in terms of how they feel about us . Gradually , we have worn men down a bit as we have gotten good jobs and supported ourselves and no longer have had to put up with very much . We can get out . I never understood Lorena Bobbitt . Why did n't she just leave , for God 's sake ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and blue . They do n't have children . Why did n't she just leave ? Back to the point , men now have to be more attentive to what women tell them . Women used to stay married because men were the meal ticket . We had no choice except to stay . Now we do n't have to . If you can leave a man , and he knows it and wants to keep you , he has to shape up . Men have come a long way in absorbing the feminist message . There 's not enough housework being done by men , not enough child raising , but we 'll get around to it . PT : Do you envy young women of today ? Do you think their life is easier than it was 30 years ago ? HGB : No . In many ways it 's tougher . In my world , plunked down just before the Great Depression , you had to get a job . You Could n't fool around and wonder who you were or if this was what you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work to support yourself . I think that was very fortunate . The least fortunate young women are the ones who have wealthy parents , because they 're not going to starve . I feel sorry for them because they do n't have the discipline . It is n't necessary for them to do what I had to do , and , therefore , they can Screw around forever before they get on with their jobs . It 's hard , but one must be totally realistic about the age that one is . It 's not ever going to go back in the other direction . You can do everything there is possibly to do in terms of cosmetic surgery and teeth fixing and exercising , but it 's not going to make you Cindy Crawford . So I do n't envy young women professionals , and I try to be a grown-up and not envy young women their youth . It does n't do you any good , so you just have to not let it enter your brain . PT : How well do you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown-up ? Somebody who accepts responsibility and fits into her life , fits in with her contemporaries , her peers ! I think I 'm terrifically grown up , but I have a few emotional problems , not having to do with accepting my age but , as I said , waking up scared every morning . That 's not so wonderful . PT : As an editor , you 've focused on the concept of service  --  that is , articles with detailed practical information telling what to do and how to do it . A lot of folks think these articles are for women or the uneducated . What do you think ? HGB : We try to be of service to our reader . That 's what we are all about . We try to make her life better . I make no apologies that we do n't do a great deal else . We do n't talk about politics or the world situation . We just focus on her life . Others can do other things for her . There 's a suggestion that the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to par intellectually . Total nonsense , of course . They read such magazines for what they get out of them . The same women are probably reading The Atlantic Monthly and Time and Forbes and Newsweek and lots of other publications . One publication can not possibly be everything to everybody . If there is a denigration of the word " service : it is at the peril of those doing the denigrating , not at women getting the service they need from magazines . PT : You consider yourself a feminist . Why do you think you 've irked some members of the feminist community ? HGB : They feel that Cosmo panders to men , that we try to make life comfortable for men , and you ca n't do that and be a feminist . I say you absolutely can . The premise for me is that sex is wonderful . Being a heterosexual woman , I think sex with a man is probably what you 're after , and being a sex object is a very good thing . If you 're not a sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known for your brain , but to have somebody want you sexually is the best thing there is . You can still look pretty and smell pretty and achieve . You ca n't get anybody to bed unless you are the object of sexual desire . So there is nothing wrong with being a sex object . He is your sex object . It works both ways . The feminist movement for a long time , perhaps with reason , denigrated men . They were the enemy . It 's mostly men who have kept women from achieving and getting parity in work and pay . I acknowledge that , but since sex is terrific and it comes from men , you ca n't rule men out of this world and say they 're all terrible and rotten  --  because you 're going to need one of them for your own purposes . Besides , not all men are terrible and rotten . Most men can be taught , encouraged , helped along . The feminist movement has come more to my viewpoint , I believe . They have acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still like men ; You do n't have to like all men , but you need one for you . Cosmo is big on what used to be called self-determination . Tough men have been a real pain in the neck in terms of job progress , you can get beyond them . What you do yourself is more important than what they do to you and what they prevent you from doing . If you use your brains and guts and whatever modest talent you have , yo can get everywhere . PT : You being a good example ? HGB : I am messianic on the subject . If I can do it , other people can do it . I held 17 secretarial jobs before I got into advertising copywriting . And it was n't until the age of 43 that I found out what I like doing  --  editing . What you can do is get your nose to the glass and look in there and see what they 've got that you do n't , and do your best to get it . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy to improve yourself , your job , your intellect , and every other possible thing . You ca n't sleep your way to the top or even to the middle , and there is no free lunch . You have to do it yourself , so you might as well get started . PT : Young woman today , say age 25 , are part of the generation that is now coming into your prime demographic zone . They have pretty much equal footing in that men are their friends now as well as their bosses . But their job prospects are dim . They are also the children of divorce . HGB : I would hope that there would be more opportunities for this generation to take advantage of , and I hope that the job situation improves . But this generation has to get off its ass and it has to stop blaming parents for everything . You have to pull yourselves together and be confident and strong . PT : What do you think is the most interesting thing about yourself ? HGB : I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so-called civilians . I know everything by the time the conversation 's finished . They know little about me . So I am thought to be an interesting person because everybody wants to talk I do n't think there 's anything interesting about me . <p>
