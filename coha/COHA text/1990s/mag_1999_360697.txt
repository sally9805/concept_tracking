Long before he was my grandfather , Grandpa splurged on an expensive piece of new technology called a television because his beloved Detroit Tigers made the World Series . My not-so-beloved Dolphins did n't make the Super Bowl this year , so I did n't follow suit and buy a pricey high-definition television ( HDTV ) set . But I borrowed one for my Super Bowl party to preview my generation 's TV transition . The early verdict : a helluva TV , but not much HD . <P> One does not tread lightly into HDTV . Just handing over the credit card for a TV that costs $5,499  --  the price of my Panasonic 56-in. projection set  --  takes some effort . A set-top box that can tune in the new digital signals adds an extra $1,499 . <P> Making room for this monument to television is no small matter either . The corner of our living room , which my wife had reserved for a baby grand ( insert your own marital discord here ) , was cleared for the HDTV 's landing , which required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With the thing in place only three days before the big game , I went to work trying to get a high-definition signal . I got none . No Miami stations have started broadcasting in HD yet and the cable-TV industry has n't even settled on a standard . My satellite dish was n't any help , either . DirecTV shows one channel of HDTV , but nobody sells a decoder that can tune it in . Aaargh ! <P> Confused ? It helps if you 're old enough to remember the early days of color TV . Buying a color set did n't instantly colorize all your favorite programs . That took years . Likewise , there are very few programs being broadcast in true HDTV  --  even in the 26 cities that already have digital TV . <P> As it turned out , my digital dilemma was moot . Fox chose not to broadcast the game in HDTV after all . Apparently the network is waiting for a bigger event , like a live Mars landing or the final episode of The Simpsons . <P> Super Sunday scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HDTV , the gridiron never looked better  --  thanks to the jumbo screen and a hidden upgrade that effectively doubles the standard analog screen resolution . The casual consensus : the best TV picture they had ever seen . <P> Films recorded on digital videodiscs look even better . Many of the hundreds of movies available on DVD are encoded with the boxy TV version on one side and the original theatrical wide version on the other . So a wide-screen set that 's ready for HDTV is also ready for DVD . A Samsung DVD player plugged into my Panasonic HDTV splayed the train wreck in The Fugitive gloriously across the full wide screen . <P> Even DVD pales beside real HDTV , however , as I learned when I finally drove to Miami last week to see it demonstrated in all its vivid , eye-popping detail at an electronics store . Too late for the Super Bowl , but , hey , there 's always next year .
