<p> As police burst through the doors one night in October , Berlin authorities cut power to 13 buildings . <p> Inside , investigators seized 25 computers and six gigabytes of bootleg software the electronic equivalent of 2 million typewritten pages . The loot included illegal copies of nearly all the world 's 250 most widely used computer programs . <p> Some of the disks contained computer viruses . Others were early beta versions of software not yet on the market . All of it was available to computer buffs dialing and downloading from Fortress of Files and 12 other computer bulletin boards shut down by police . <p> The Berlin raid and others like it around the world are increasingly common as U.S. software firms , movie studios , book publishers and record companies push foreign governments to move against piracy , which cost the four industries an estimated $ 18 billion last year . Despite hard-won victories in Singapore , Indonesia and other countries , the U.S. copyright industries are losing more each year . <p> " If we could make the problem go away overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lawyer for Microsoft , maker of MS-DOS , Windows and other software . <p> The demand for bootleg goods is rising , particularly in developing nations where the number of computers , VCRs and tape decks is fast multiplying . Foreign consumers are hungry for American movies and music . Governments , businesses and schools want computer programs and technical information produced by U.S. software firms and book publishers . <p> Pirates often are the cheapest source of this intellectual property . Their overhead does not include payments to artists and authors , expenses for research and development or fees for licensing , importing or copyrights . Most pirate manufacturers use cheap labor and cut corners on quality . <p> " Thieves are making millions and millions of dollars a day off us , " says Eric Smith , executive director of the International Intellectual Property Alliance , a coalition of record companies , publishers , software makers and Hollywood studios . <p> The IIPA is naming names in a stinging report just filed with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor . Singled out are 28 nations where pirates flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses at $ 4.6 billion . Worldwide , loss is estimated at $ 17.5 billion . Smith says the alliance wants " massive retaliation " in the form of trade sanctions against two nations it says are paradise for pirates Thailand and Taiwan . <p> Frank Wells , president of Disney , and Jack Valenti , head of the Motion Picture Association of America , also have met with Kantor . They want sanctions against Italy , where Hollywood figures it lost $ 224 million to piracy last year . The Italian government " does n't care about ripoffs of Snow White , " says Smith . " They have a criminal enforcement system in total disarray . " <p> Stopping piracy can be dangerous . Investigators often get death threats from gangsters who make their living as copyright pirates . A Taiwan music-industry official was wounded in a knife attack in 1991 . <p> More often , however , the battle is tedious . The IIPA has harangued officials in South Korea , Italy and the Philippines for years , demanding that they pass tough copyright-protection laws . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws . <p> Italy grants amnesty to movie pirates or gives them suspended sentences . In the Philippines , it is legal to reproduce any foreign book not sold there for less than $ 2.80 . <p> South Korea refuses to revoke business licenses of companies known to be pirates . " It is unbelievably frustrating and unprecedented to have a government so completely implicated in piracy , " says Neil Turkewitz of the Recording Industry Association of America . <p> Frustrating maybe , but not unprecedented . The Thai government knows of four pirate audio-tape plants and one illegal CD-stamping plant but refuses to raid them at night , IIPA says . So the plants crank out Thai-music recordings during the day and do their piracy after dark . Trucks loaded with illegal recordings leave before sunrise each day . <p> The Chinese government is one of the world 's leading pirates , supervising the duplication of foreign software and books for internal consumption and the manufacture of CDs for export . Russia now is so chaotic and rife with piracy that Hollywood studios refuse to distribute films there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws and good enforcement , theft continues . Until recently , a quirky German copyright law kept U.S. software makers from pursuing pirates there . The law so narrowly defined what could be protected that software firms feared a prosecution might prompt a German court to place their computer programs in the public domain . <p> Audio tapes , movies and books are easily pirated . Books are photocopied or , if time and equipment are available and color is needed , printed from offset plates . In countries such as Egypt and Turkey , most graduate-level scientific and medical texts are bootlegs . In China , there are more than 500,000 illicit copies of Iacocca in English and Chinese . <p> Hundreds of pirate tapes of a 40-minute album can be made in about a minute with a high-speed duplicator . On the street in Bangkok , a copy of Whitney Houston 's soundtrack to The Bodyguard costs about $ 1 . Movies are copied onto videotape in much the same way as audio tapes . <p> The music industry is worried now about the growing number of pirate-CD plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as good as a legitimate tape , " says Smith . " But with a bootleg CD , there 's no degeneration in quality . " <p> There are several ways to steal software . Pirates in Asian countries manufacture counterfeit versions of Windows and other programs . Computer salesmen the world over load new PCs with illegally copied programs as inducements to buyers . Computer bulletin boards like the Fortress of Files in Berlin offer hundreds of programs to callers . <p> Among the biggest software pirates are respected businesses such as Germany 's Hoechst and Italy 's Montedison , both of which have been raided and agreed to pay settlements to software makers . Companies " will have 100 PCs and five copies of a particular program . They just keep loading the program into more machines until they have all they need , " says Robert Holleyman , president of the Business Software Alliance , a group of eight software companies . That kind of piracy , called end-user piracy , is common in the USA , too . <p> The IIPA argues that companies making copyrighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , the four copyright industries have been growing at more than twice the rate of the overall U.S. economy and creating jobs almost three times faster . Individually , each leads the world in market share . <p> But the USA , fearful of looking like a bully , has been reluctant to move against countries providing haven for pirates . <p> The IIPA 's Smith spends much of his time trying to convince the worst violators that they ca n't attract high-tech western investment as long as they tolerate piracy . <p> Some less-developed countries say the USA 's insistence on strict copyright enforcement is a form of cultural imperialism : It keeps the developing nations dependent on U.S. imports . Brazilian officials have argued that they have a moral obligation to provide their people with cheap medicines by allowing the piracy of patented drugs . Some countries contend the same moral right exists for the software and technical information they need to modernize . <p> Smith believes attitudes are gradually shifting , even in the most recalcitrant governments . " They are fostering copying cultures , not innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And most of them would like to change it .
