I never would have guessed what I started when I told the Irregulars it was OK to cry . I dropped in at Kelly 's Bar &; Grill the other evening and announced loudly to the Kelly Irregulars , " Hey , guys , guess what ? It 's OK for men to cry ! " My announcement was greeted by a resounding silence . Kelly , who had stretched his undershirt out from his belly for the purpose of drying a shot glass , stared at me in disbelief . " Who says ? " he asked . " This psychologist on the television , that 's who . " " You 're putting us on , " Retch Sweeney said . " This is another one of your jokes , right ? " " No , it 's true , " I said . " First you get in touch with your feelings and after that , you cry . " " Why would I want to cry ? " Stubb Hinkle asked . " Because it will make you feel good , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a matter of fact , I feel great . I just won three hands of poker . " " Yeah , " I said . " But you have n't got in touch with your feelings . After you get in touch with your feelings , you 'll feel bad . So then you 'll cry . That 'll make you feel good . " " I think I 'll just skip getting in touch with my feelings , " Stubb said . " That way I 'll go right from happy to happy . Deal the cards , Sweeney . " " Crying will help you pick up girls , " I said . " So , let 's think about this a minute , " Stubb said . " Tell me more about this feeling stuff . " " Well , as I understand it , the modern woman is looking to form a relationship with a sensitive man . A man who cries is obviously a man in touch with his feelings and therefore a sensitive man , as opposed to , let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose major cultural attainment is comic belching , no offense Stubb . " " None taken . I guess I could have a go at getting in touch with my feelings . Heck , it 's been so long since I 've been in touch with a feeling , I 'm not even sure where to look for one . But I 'm willing to give it a try . A little self-improvement never hurt nobody . " A bunch of the other guys shouted out that they would like to get in touch with their feelings , too . " Wait a darn minute ! " Kelly roared from behind the bar . " I do n't want all these elbows to start blubbering like a pack of crybabies . Be bad for business . " " Do n't worry , " I told Kelly . " This is not the appropriate setting for getting in touch with feelings . What we need to do is go on a camping trip . " I explained how the psychologist on television had taken 20 or so men out on a camping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them all crying and screaming and beating the ground with sticks , they were so in touch with their feelings . I knew the psychologist was onto something , because I myself had been on camping trips where I 'd felt like crying and screaming and beating not only the ground with sticks , but some of the other campers as well . Not realizing that I was in touch with my feelings , I had kept these emotions bottled up and never shed so much as a single tear . Afterward , I went about for weeks being insensitive . Fortunately , nobody seemed to notice . A camping trip obviously was the perfect situation for getting in touch with feelings and learning how to cry . " We gon na take a psychologist along with us ? " Eddie O'Toole asked . " Naw , " I said . " I 'll play the part of the psychologist . I took Psyche 101 in college . " " That do n't seem like much , " Eddie said . " I took it twice . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a van to haul the Kelly Irregulars and our gear to a little campsite far up in the mountains . We pitched our tents and rolled out our sleeping bags next to a mountain stream . The guys spent the afternoon fly-fishing . It was n't long before I detected the first sign that one of them had been put in touch with a feeling . Burt Hix returned to camp with tears in his eyes . " Tell me about it , Burt , " I coaxed . " Your feeling had something to do with a recollection of your early relationship with your father , if I 'm not mistaken ? " " No , " he said , plopping down on a log . " I just hooked the biggest rainbow trout of my life and had it slip off not six inches from the net . Man , that hurts . So near and yet so far . " " Stifle it , Burt , " I said sternly . " We 're here to learn how to cry , not whine . Now tell me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what fly were you using ? " That evening , after feeding the guys a sumptuous dinner of my Whatchagot Stew , wieners and sand-pit biscuits , I gathered them around the fire to begin my probe of their innermost feelings . " Any of you guys touched a feeling yet that you would like to tell us about ? " I asked . They looked from one to another , obviously embarrassed . Finally , Pete Boggs hesitantly raised his hand . " Yes , Pete ? " I said encouragingly . " Gosh , I do n't know , " he said . " It 's just that sitting here around the fire with you fellas reminded me of a camping trip I went on with my father . " " Your father , " I said . " Very good . As far as I could determine from the psychologist on TV , fathers are to blame for most of their sons ' bad feelings . Once they were put in touch with their feelings , the psychologist 's campers claimed they were all messed up emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To tell the truth , I could n't blame the fathers all that much . But go ahead , Pete . " Pete , clearly suffering , related the following . " Well , me and Pop were camped out on the Kootenai River , and Pop cooked dinner over the fire just like you did tonight and afterward we lay in our sleeping bags looking up at the stars and talking . And I got to thinking about that night , and pretty soon this terrible feeling started welling up inside of me . " " Probably something your father said , " I suggested . " Actually , it was something he cooked . I have n't had indigestion like this since the old man concocted that green hash of his ! " " Wow , that 's a relief , " Retch Sweeney said . " Here I thought I was in touch with a feeling , and it 's only heartburn . " " Would you guys , knock it off ! " I said . " This is serious business . Now somebody better come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or there 's no nightcap tonight . " Psychologists call this " shock therapy . " I could see that it was working . Their faces screwed up in intense concentration as the Kelly Irregulars tried to rake up some sins of their fathers . " Hey , I think I got one ! " shouted Stuart Simpson . Everybody applauded and several of the guys slapped Simp on the back . " Way to go , Simp ! " Retch said . " Tell us about it , Simp , " I said softly . I could see he was deeply in touch with a feeling , because his eyes were glistening wetly in the firelight . " One day my dad came home and caught me sitting in front of the TV when I was supposed to be out raking the yard , " Simp said . " He yelled at me . Then he started ripping up my comic books . I told him I 'd run away . He said , " Great ! Write when you get work ! ' Just like that . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a job doing janitor work at nights . It hurts . " " That 's wonderful , Simp ! " I exclaimed . " Absolutely wonderful ! " Simp smiled sadly through his tears , which were actually starting to trickle down his face . The other fellows looked more than a little shaken by the story . Retch Sweeney cleared his throat . " Gee , your old man was pretty tough on you , Simp . I wish I could come up with a bad feeling like that about my dad . How old were you anyway ? " " Thirty-two . " We all sat there staring silently into the fire , as Simp sniffled and snuffled . " Simp , " I said kindly , " I appreciate your sharing that with us . It must have been painful for you . I know it was painful for me . " " Thanks , " Simp said . " Now do we get the nightcap ? " " Yes , indeed , " I said . " Hot chocolate for everybody ! Break out the marshmallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple burst into tears . It was a start . Just before the icy downpour that night , a wind came up and blew down the tents . The rain turned to snow by morning , and we had to eat cold cereal for breakfast , because we could n't get a fire going . The men complained because I had used up all the milk on the hot chocolate the night before , and they had to eat their cereal dry . I explained that milk would n't have helped raw oatmeal all that much anyway . " I 'm freezing and starving to death , " Retch Sweeney moaned . " I say we all pile into the van and drive down to Burt 's Roadhouse for hot coffee and sausage and bacon and eggs and stacks of pancakes streaming with butter and syrup . " Upon hearing this , a number of Irregulars sobbed openly and unashamedly as they pleaded with me to head for Burt 's . " No way , " I said . " I have n't yet managed to put you guys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of gas . " At that , all the Irregulars began to cry and scream and run around beating the ground with sticks . It was wonderful . So wonderful , in fact , I joined in myself . Late that afternoon , a forest ranger loaned us enough gas to get back to town . It was a miserable drive . I do n't know how many times I had to yell at the Irregulars , " Would you guys shut up ! I 'm sick to death of your blubbering ! " A mile or so from Burt 's Roadhouse , stopped the van and made everybody take an oath that in the future we would all keep our feelings decently bottled up and never cry in front of another person , unless , of course , it was a really sharp-looking modern woman . When I got home from the camping trip , my wife , Bun , met me at the door . " How did it go ? " she asked . " You manage to iron out the wrinkled psyches of the Kelly Irregulars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I 'm beat . How about cleaning up the van for me and sorting out all the wet gear ? " " No , way , " she said , pleasantly . " Please , " I said . " Otherwise , I may cry . " " Sorry , bucko , " she replied . " I 'm going shopping . " So maybe crying does n't work with all modern women . Still , it was worth a try . <p>
