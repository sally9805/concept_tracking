<p> On the long line of great American evangelists , Billy Graham may be the greatest . But his age has opened the question of succession . <p> " The gifts he gave were that some would be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , some pastors and teachers . . . " <p> - Ephesians 4:11 , <p> New Revised Standard Version <p> When the Rev. Billy Graham steps up to the pulpit in the Georgia Dome on Wednesday night to begin his 1994 Atlanta Crusade , he will be carrying on a tradition that goes back centuries . <p> While ministers tend to the chores of a church - baptizing , marrying and burying - evangelists travel from community to community offering salvation to sinners . The concept is nearly as old as Christianity : St. Paul acknowledged the evangelist 's role in his letter to the Ephesians . <p> But no one has ever evangelized like Graham - largely because no one else has had the technology or transportation available to make the kind of worldwide impact Graham has made . <p> He arose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the country 's earliest days . But some scholars say he may be the end of the line . <p> Graham 's statistics are mind-boggling : preaching in person to more than 100 million people - 16 times the number of men , women and children in all of Georgia - and to countless millions more over radio and television . <p> Graham also has managed during more than 50 years in the public spotlight to maintain a reputation for financial integrity and sexual fidelity . <p> Now he is " A Christian in Winter , " as Time magazine called him last year , marking his 75th birthday . The shining blond hair is grayer , the determined stride is slowed by Parkinson 's disease and the blue eyes are now often behind spectacles . <p> His age and health give rise to the question of whether there will be a next great evangelist . Students of American religion are divided in their predictions . <p> " There will never be another Billy Graham , " says Randall Balmer , a religion professor at Barnard College and producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and coming <p> But Ben Johnson , professor of evangelism and church growth at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur , says that " throughout the history of the church there have risen seemingly prophetic voices , spokespersons for a particular age . I do n't think there 's anything that will prohibit another prophet arising in this culture . " <p> Three men are frequently mentioned as Graham 's possible successors . <p> Luis Palau , an Argentine whose Oregon-based ministry has conducted crusades in 62 nations , bringing in 11 million people . Since 1990 , Palau has been conducting crusades in U.S. cities , including one this month in Tulsa . But at 60 , Palau may not have time to reach Graham 's level . <p> Greg Laurie , a former surfer , is 41 and being touted as the evangelist to the baby boomer and baby buster generations . Unlike many evangelists , Laurie has a church : the 12,000-member Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside , Calif . <p> Laurie 's crusades have been confined to the West and Hawaii , including his most recent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be too much like that of Graham in his earlier days , says Balmer , who calls Laurie a " throwback . " <p> Franklin Graham , Billy and Ruth Bell Graham 's oldest son , has the good looks to please television cameras and the family name to draw crowds . While he conducts crusades in medium-sized cities , however , Graham seems primarily committed to relief missions to war-torn countries . <p> A fourth name occasionally surfaces : that of Graham daughter Anne Graham Lotz . She has the charisma and the preaching ability , according to most critics . But she has one obvious drawback , as evidenced last year when an invitation to address the Oklahoma Baptist Convention was withdrawn because a conservative faction raised a ruckus about having a woman preach . <p> Although no one claims to be sure who the next great evangelist might be , some scholars say they can describe traits that person must have : integrity , clarity , an inclusive message , a powerful personality and a vision of how to use the mass media of the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the scene yet , but when the great evangelists have arisen in the past , they have been products of their times , according to Mark Noll , a professor of history and evangelism at Billy Graham 's alma mater , Wheaton College . And each built on the work of his predecessors . <p> From Solomon Stoddard , known as the father of American evangelism , and his grandson Jonathan Edward came the formula of laying out a litany of sins , emphasizing the probability of hellfire , then offering the promise of eternal life . <p> George Whitefield took the message to the people by preaching in fields and parks , tantalizing listeners with catchy themes that always led back to salvation . Charles Grandison Finney introduced the " invitation " at the end of his services . Dwight Moody added musical entertainment and revival preparation in local congregations . <p> Then , at the start of the 20th century , when some predicted the end of the traveling evangelist , Billy Sunday hit the circuit , stirring up sawdust like a cyclone with his colorful preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing him to devote more attention to the sermons that drew more than a million sinners to the front of his revival meeting . <p> On the night Sunday died , Nov. 6 , 1935 , 16-year-old Billy Frank Graham walked to the front of evangelist Mordecai Ham 's revival tent in Charlotte and accepted Jesus . <p> Because of the history , some scholars expect someone to rise to succeed Graham . <p> " I think it is significant that in the past , when the leading evangelist of the day was getting ready to exit the scene , people speculated whether there would be a successor , " Weber says . " There always seems to be someone . " <p> Where from here ? <p> Others say the time of mass evangelism has passed . <p> " I think Billy Graham comes toward the end of an emphasis on itinerant evangelists in North America as a major influence , " says Dennis Fisher , a professor of evangelism and discipleship at Moody Bible Institute . " That does n't mean the death of evangelism . It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nondenominational organizations such as Campus Crusade for Christ , the Navigators and the Promisekeepers will assume much of the evangelist 's role , Fisher predicts . " I think instead of the traveling evangelist , where the emphasis is on the ability to communicate from a platform while everybody looks to him , there 's an emphasis now on equipping lay people to share the gospel . " <p> Megachurches - congregations of thousands with plethoras of programs and sophisticated , entertaining services - each Sunday offer many of the benefits that once were available through mass evangelism , says Stephen Gunter , a professor of evangelism at Emory University 's Candler School of Theology . <p> " When you 've got that kind of social structure that is distinctively Christian , then there 's a sense in which the need for the crusade is not what it once was , " he says . " I do n't mean spiritual needs - they 're as great as they 've ever been - but social needs of people to be a part of something greater than they are . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plenty of evangelists out there to keep the word spreading throughout the world . Over the past few years , he has conducted in-person clinics and satellite training sessions for evangelists . <p> In the meantime , he continues to spread the Gospel . He will have his largest revival yet next year , reaching the entire world simultaneously with sermons translated into dozens of languages in about 130 countries as people gather in churches and auditoriums with local pastors and trained volunteers to follow up the crusade message . <p> If the appeal of stadium-style crusades is declining in the United States , there is no evidence that other countries are tiring of it . <p> Some of the greatest crowds are in countries where evangelical Christianity is new or was suppressed for decades . <p> Perhaps the next great evangelist will be Korean or Latin American , suggests Noll . <p> But as the United States becomes more secular , the greatest opportunity for an evangelist may be within our borders , says Johnson of Columbia . <p> The church no longer holds the place of influence it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming largely cultural , " a social organization that is coated over with religious language and symbolism . " <p> A great evangelist could come along to call the church back to its roots , he says . " The other side of the equation is that this evangelist could also be the one who articulates the faith to a thoroughly secular , pagan society and proclaims hope . "
