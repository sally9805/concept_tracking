##@x <p> Exhibiting an impressive willingness to cooperate against a common danger , President Gorbachev responded Saturday to President Bush 's remarkable arms initiative of a week ago with an even better one . The two leaders are now moving with reassuring swiftness to tighten their grip on their countries ' excessive nuclear arsenals . And they 're making that task easier by cutting the stockpiles down to more manageable size . <p> By consigning the least controllable of these arms , short-range or tactical weapons , to the scrap heap , Mr. Gorbachev joined Mr. Bush in helping the world breathe a little easier . <p> Even more significantly , he 's demobilizing hundreds of missiles that can reach the United States without waiting for ratification of the pending strategic arms treaty , or Start . That could keep the missiles now based in restive outlying republics from falling into the wrong hands . He also opened the way to far deeper cuts by announcing that he will dismantle 1,000 more warheads than he 's obliged to under the treaty . Now it 's up to Mr. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political transformation has exorcised the Soviet military threat , it seems astounding that for decades Washington and Moscow sought security by piling up nuclear warheads to such absurdly high levels  --  over 50,000 between them . The political upheavals in Moscow and the alarming nuclear program in Iraq brought home the urgent need to bring nuclear arms under control . <p> Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev have now recognized the danger and seized the opportunity . In just eight days , they 've pledged to scrap more warheads than negotiators did in years of arms talks . Their actions have also made it easier to control the arms that remain . <p> To his credit , Mr. Bush was the first to act . By unilaterally pledging to get rid of all ground-launched short-range nuclear warheads , he made Mr. Gorbachev an offer he had to reciprocate . Mr. Gorbachev did even better . Now Mr. Bush needs at least to match him or say why he ca n't . <p> In agreeing to eliminate all nuclear artillery shells and short-range missile warheads , Mr. Gorbachev gives up more than does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abandon , given the doubtful utility and inherent uncontrollability of these arms . Much more significant , Mr. Gorbachev pledged to take out of operation 503 of his intercontinental-range missiles , 134 of them with multiple warheads . He had pledged to demobilize these under the pending strategic arms treaty , but will now go ahead even before U.S. ratification . If Mr. Gorbachev includes all land-based missiles outside the Russian republic in this demobilization , that would help protect against loss of control . <p> Even more , Mr. Gorbachev pledged to cut the Soviet arsenal of long-range nuclear arms to 5,000 warheads  --  1,000 below the ceiling agreed to in Start . Mr. Bush would be wise to respond in kind and formally lower the Start ceiling . That might induce Moscow to move toward what he wants , a ban all land-based missiles armed with multiple warheads . <p> Mr. Gorbachev 's unilateral move gives impetus to still deeper cuts . Mr. Bush can provide a push of his own by proposing to scrap America 's 50 MX missiles in return for equivalent cuts in Soviet multi-warhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in removing all nuclear arms from surface ships and attack submarines , scrapping some and storing the rest . He wants to go further and ban them . That invites a suitable swap : the U.S. could agree to give up nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles , where it has an advantage , in return for further cuts in Soviet land-based multi-warhead missiles . <p> Mr. Gorbachev also proposed removing all nuclear warheads from tactical aircraft . Mr. Bush wo n't have an easy time explaining why U.S. aircraft based in Europe have such warheads , now that the Red Army is going home . <p> The one-year moratorium on nuclear testing announced by Mr. Gorbachev is not much of a concession , given that Moscow has no place to conduct such tests now that its test facilities in Kazakhstan are shut down . But Mr. Bush wo n't find it easy to say what he needs to test so urgently that he ca n't agree to a one-year moratorium . <p> Finally , Mr. Gorbachev accepted Mr. Bush 's invitation to discuss non-nuclear defenses against missiles , a version of Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to accept deployment . Mr. Bush will have a tough time showing Moscow how Star Wars will facilitate much-needed reductions and tighter control of arms . @@649982 1 <br> Present Day <br> " My God , " Michael Rose murmured . He 'd been off in another world , thinking about that day five years past when he and Sheila had been arrested at Dulles airport . Thinking about how deeply it had affected his life , how it had shaken his faith in his government . How it had taken a year to get to the truth behind what had happened . " Amazing . " <br> David Cortez glanced up , following his boss 's line of sight . Cortez had been about to pick up his beer off the smooth , dark-wood bar but stopped with the chilled glass halfway to his lips . " Jesus , " he said softly with a hint of a Cuban accent . <br> Rose tried not to stare , but he could n't help himself . He 'd spent an entire career keeping his nose an inch from the grindstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were constantly swirling around him as he climbed higher and higher on Trafalgar 's corporate ladder . Now , in an instant , this . " She 's perfect . " <br> " Yeah , she is , " Cortez agreed . <br> The young woman sat on a tall stool on the other side of the bar , a glass of champagne on the napkin in front of her . She was keeping two young professionals in sharp suits and bright ties occupied without even trying . Both of them were doing everything but juggling to get her attention , but she was playing them off against each other beautifully . Touching their arms lightly , smiling at them demurely with her full , glossy lips . It was an incredible smile . She was an incredible woman . <br> " I need to meet her . " <br> Cortez turned toward Rose . " Easy , Mike , " he warned . They 'd worked together since Rose had been promoted to chief financial officer , and they 'd gotten very close after a lot of late nights at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of black coffee , a lot of good-nights to the kids over the phone . And a lot of guilt . More than anyone else , Cortez knew how vulnerable Rose was right now . " We 're almost to the finish line , we 've got ta stay focused . " <br> But Rose kept staring . Mid to late twenties , he guessed . Old enough to be worldly , young enough to be impressionable . Not from or with money , either . From where he sat , that engagement diamond on her left hand looked like a microchip  --  less than a third of a carat , probably closer to a quarter  --  and her low-cut blouse was straight off a rounder rack at Sears . He watched as the man who he assumed was her husband cut aggressively between the two professionals and kissed her . Watched her react with a kiss of familiarity . A kiss devoid of passion . Watched the two suitors fade into the crowd , disappointment etched into their expressions . Then felt disappointment sink into his own chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons . <br> " Yeah , " Rose agreed quietly . He 'd heard about this happening , everyone had  --  the lightning bolt  --  he 'd just never thought it could strike him . Especially now when he was on the lookout for it . " I guess you 're right . " <br> Then it happened : They caught each other 's gaze , and it momentarily paralyzed him . Her eyes were like lasers cutting through the cigar smoke , low light , and noise . Sparkling beams the color of Caribbean water on a postcard locking onto him and not letting him go , blacking out everything else around them . Rose was the number two executive at Trafalgar Industries , chief financial officer of one of the biggest companies in the world , a corporate superstar at forty-three . But suddenly he felt like an awkward , pimply kid at a high school dance . She was even more attractive than he 'd first thought , and not just physically . She had a startling genuineness about her that shone through the potent sexuality . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was back on his heels . God , what a risk this would be . <br> Cortez touched Rose 's arm . " Mike . " <br> Rose put his elbows on the bar , covered his face with his hands and rubbed his forehead with his fingertips , wondering where Sheila was . When he 'd called home an hour ago , the au pair had told him that his wife had left the house at noon but had n't been back or called since . He checked his watch : eight o'clock . Maybe it was finally time to hire a private detective . <br> " Mike . " <br> " Yeah , yeah . " Rose glanced across the bar , but the young woman and her husband were gone , presumably headed into the adjoining Morton 's Restaurant , one of the best steak houses in northern Virginia . He looked over at Cortez . " You committed to this acquisition , David ? You committed to getting CIS ? " <br> Cortez nodded . <br> " A hundred percent ? " <br> " Absolutely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake the image of the woman from his mind . But that was impossible . <br> From the Hardcover edition . <br> Continues ...
