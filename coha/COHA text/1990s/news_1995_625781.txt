<p> It 's been seven years since we 've seen Harrison Ford in a romantic comedy . That makes Sabrina , opening Friday , a new test of Ford 's position as the world 's most successful box office attraction . <p> Since " Working Girl , " Ford has concentrated primarily on action- adventure films , the genre that originally brought him fame in Star Wars . He 's re-created his Indiana Jones role , played Tom Clancy 's hero Jack Ryan in two films and run from the law as fugitive Richard Kimble . Only in Presumed Innocent , in which he was a lawyer accused of murder , and Regarding Henry , as a lawyer starting his life over , did he swerve from the action path . <p> Ford has carefully steered his career in a sound , commercial course - especially since audiences responded poorly to his unpleasant , mercurial character in The Mosquito Coast . <p> But he says that 's not the reason he has n't done romantic comedy in a while . <p> " " I have n't been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees it , most successful comedies today are in the Dumb and Dumber mold , where he does not belong . <p> " " I love stupid , but I love to watch other people do it . <p> " " I always look for something different to do . It 's hard to find something that feels real and emotionally compelling , which is really important . I do n't know how you can go in to make a movie without feeling there is a real main emotional vein in there . " <p> It took going back 40 years , to a Hollywood classic , for Ford to find something emotionally compelling . Sabrina is a remake of the much-loved 1954 film that starred Humphrey Bogart as flint-hearted tycoon Linus Larrabee , the role Ford now has , and Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina Fairchild , the charming daughter of Linus ' chauffeur . Julia Ormond plays Sabrina in the new version . <p> In the story , Sabrina loves David , the rich , frivolous younger son of her father 's boss . David starts to show interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry the daughter of another magnate , so they can merge their companies . <p> Linus sets out to win Sabrina 's affections by pretending to love her . Eventually he plans to pay her off and get her out of the way . He does n't count on Sabrina 's charm or his own ability to fall in love . <p> " " Linus has forgotten that he has a potential for happiness , " Ford said . " " He 's so caught up in the pleasures that attend to the acquisition of power and money , he 's forgotten about the other potentials . " <p> As he has acquired power and money , Ford has kept sight of his own potential for happiness . He works very hard to keep himself and his family separate from his work . <p> " " I certainly feel what happened to Linus could have happened to me . And I 'm pleased that I do n't think it did . " <p> When not on the job , Ford escapes to his ranch near Jackson Hole , Wyo. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and their children Malcolm , 8 , and Georgia , 5 . ( Ford also has two grown sons from his first marriage . ) <p> At times , like right now when he 's filming Devil 's Own in New York with Brad Pitt , Ford moves , family and all , to a location near his job . But he 's always eager to get back home , where he can work around the house . <p> Ford threw Bill Clinton a dinner party on his ranch in August , an unofficial birthday party for the president . Ford prefers not to discuss details of the event . He finds it an advantage to his work to keep his private life private . <p> " " I have always believed that , " he says firmly . <p> Though his first film role was in Dead Heat on a Merry-Go Round in 1966 , he did n't find any real stardom until Star Wars in 1977 , when he was 35 . Though he loves the freedom of choice and living arrangements that fame and wealth have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best . <p> " " I might have been more content ( with less success ) because I would n't have had to worry about some of the things that I 've had to make part of my consciousness . " His movies have brought in more money than any other star 's in history . Among the top 10 moneymakers of all time are four Ford films : Star Wars , The Return of the Jedi , Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back . True , three of those are from one series , but Ford has many other blockbusters : both Indiana Jones sequels , The Fugitive and the Jack Ryan films . <p> Theories on why we like to watch him usually come back to the basic values he projects . But it 's probably more to do with his lucky choice of films early in his career and his cagey choices later on . <p> " " What I look for in a film is audience satisfaction , " Ford said . " " Not a great part for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good idea to start with , you 're shit out of luck from the very get-go . <p> " " I wo n't do an action film that does n't also have some emotional balance and interest . The audience may not even know they want that , but after they 've seen the sixth goddamn thing blow up , they do n't give a shit , because they do n't care about any of the people being blown up . " <p> The Fugitive was a successful remake for Ford , but Sabrina is a tougher act to follow . The original is regarded as a classic , often shown on television . Directed by Billy Wilder , one of Hollywood 's greatest directors , it 's funny and painful and rich , with pointed satire aimed at class snobbery . <p> Ford had not seen the movie until after he signed for the role . That it was a remake did n't enter into his decision . <p> " " In my ignorance , no , " he said , laughing softly . " " Hamlet is always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question this . " <p> Nor did the aura of the legendary Bogart enter his thinking . <p> " " I looked at the film once , " he said . " " I was very careful not to put myself in the position of wanting to judge his performance . It 's what it was a long time ago . <p> " " The character of Linus is probably the most reconstructed in terms of modernizing the material . " <p> At 53 , Ford is closer in age to Ormond , 30 , than Bogart , 55 , was to Hepburn , 25 , in the original . ( The more youthful Cary Grant was the ideal choice for Linus , but he was n't available and Bogart took the role . He hated the movie and disliked Wilder and Hepburn . ) <p> It 's Hollywood reality that older actors are often paired with much younger actresses . Actors with clout often demand it . It makes them seem more vital if young women cling to them . <p> Ford is quick to point out that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirren in Mosquito Coast , Anne Archer in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger , Bonnie Bedelia in Presumed Innocent and Sigourney Weaver in Working Girl ( though he winds up with the younger Melanie Griffith ) . <p> In Sabrina , some age difference is important . <p> Especially in the new version , in which Linus ' awakening to his own lost feelings and youth are a major element . Ford said that in real life , both sides sometimes benefit in such spring-fall romances . <p> " " I think it 's clear by the time this relationship is formed that Sabrina is able to take care of herself . She 's going into this of her own volition . She 's not seduced by Linus ' power or money . She 's finally seduced by the fact Linus is in love with her . That 's the redeeming characteristic . " <p> Whether he is playing an action hero , a romantic lead or a dramatic role , Ford says his approach to the job is always the same . <p> " " Even in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told . A moment in that event that will change that character or change the story . So when you approach it as an actor , you do it exactly the same . " <p> The Linus role is deceivingly complex . He is offering one face to his family , one to Sabrina , and trying to convince himself he knows which is which . He does n't realize one reality is becoming the other , even when the audience does . <p> " " My understanding of Linus is pretty much led by my experience as an actor , " he said . " " This is it in a nutshell : You go into a scene knowing what needs to be represented in order to tell the story . You begin to represent an emotion or a point of view . Suddenly , in the midst of representation , it becomes real . That is a real tear coming out of your eye . You really feel something emotionally . <p> " " That 's what 's happening to Linus . In the midst of feeling those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to those feelings , until finally he realizes he 's caught , hoisted by his own petard .
