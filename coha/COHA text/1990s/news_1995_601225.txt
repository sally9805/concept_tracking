<p> The coming of one of the most awaited computer products ever is now a gritty , down-to-the-deadline drama . <p> After a year of delays , software giant Microsoft is determined to have Windows 95 , its new version of its popular core personal computer software , in stores Aug. 24 . <p> Top managers huddle daily in a war room in Building 5 of Microsoft 's Redmond , Wash. , headquarters to sweat and fight over the final details . <p> Any fix now has to be approved by higher-ups ; managers fear fixing one bug will cause another . <p> Meanwhile , 40,000 formal testers are dissecting minute details , as are 400,000 others who were granted the right to buy preview copies at $ 30 and make comments . <p> Microsoft brags that Windows 95 is the most tested software ever . As well it should : The fabulously complex program comprises 10 million lines of computer code . <p> Any day now - even Microsoft ca n't say exactly when - Windows 95 will be completed and sent to manufacturers to mass produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on store shelves and in new PCs by Aug. 24 . <p> But a huge showstopper looms . The Justice Department is investigating Microsoft 's plans to distribute software with Windows 95 that allows users to easily sign up for a its on-line service , Microsoft Network . <p> In a filing in New York Thursday , Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Bingaman said the government has n't decided yet whether to present a case , but is concerned Microsoft might be " taking advantage of market position in operating systems to gain advantage elsewhere . " <p> " This is the industry 's version of the O.J. Simpson trial , " says David Coursey , editor of P.C. Letter . " Developers are burning the midnight oil , while the lawyers go after one another , while people wonder if it will ever make it out . " <p> Still , the entire technology world is giddy about the product . <p> Millions of consumers are expected to snap up copies . Top PC makers are grappling with plans to install the program on new computers , betting it will boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add-on products , software and marketing campaigns to Windows 95 . More delays would push back an expected gravy train . <p> That has Wall Street on edge ; traders are tuned to every hint of delay . <p> Microsoft , unsurprisingly , is doing everything it can to build momentum . It 's about to wrap up a 23-city Windows 95 World Tour , which has drawn thousands in some venues . <p> After already spending more than $ 100 million on research , it will spend another $ 100 million to market the product . This weekend , Microsoft will kick off a " Coming soon . . . " joint marketing campaign with retailers such as Walmart , Best Buy , Sam 's and CompUSA . The campaign will fill stores with promotional material and PC demonstrations . <p> " You ca n't get away from the hype at all , " says David Finkel , 20 , a senior at Tulane who has been in the market for a PC . " All I 've heard is that it 's a big deal . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of it , " says George Yates , 58 , of Kent , Wash . " What it will actually do I do n't know . " <p> Now even Microsoft officials say the pre-launch hype has been overdone . " It 's just software , " senior vice president Brad Silverberg said at a recent gathering of software developers . " It does n't cure cancer . It does n't grow hair . It 's not a floor wax . It 's Windows . " <p> Since May 1990 , when version 3.0 was launched , Windows has proved a phenomenal success . It gave people an easier-to-use , picture-based way to control the basic functions of their PCs . No longer did they have to memorize arcane techie commands . <p> Windows now comes installed on more than 80% of all PCs sold . More than 65 million PCs worldwide run Windows . The success has helped boost Microsoft and its stock , which has made CEO and founder Bill Gates worth more than $ 12 billion . <p> But because other software companies must make their programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant force , as well as the object of envy and government scrutiny . <p> Windows 95 is expected to be a substantial improvement over the current version , though to fully utilize its features many people will have to upgrade their computers . <p> It was designed to allow people to run programs easier , faster and with less chance of crashing . <p> About 300 PC makers have signed up to put it on new PCs over the next several months . Consumers are expected to snap up Windows 95 copies at stores , for $ 109 each . <p> Experts project Microsoft will sell between 22 million and 29 million copies the four months after launch , worth up to $ 1.17 billion in revenue . <p> Windows 95 will also " spur sales of many , many other products , " says Alan Bush , president of Computer City Superstores . <p> He expects a stampede of people buying equipment to run Windows 95 well : memory , hard drives and multi-media add-ons such as sound cards , video boards and speakers . <p> Already , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sale . The stock of Touchstone Software jumped 57% since Wednesday , after it launched a program to help consumers upgrade their PCs . <p> The Windows glow has propped up technology stocks all summer . A rumor of another delay helped push the Dow Jones industrial average down 20 points recently , until the company disavowed the notion . <p> With so much riding on the product , even some of Microsoft 's detractors hope the product finally launches . " Another delay would be a headache for everyone , " says one-time Microsoft nemesis Philippe Kahn , former CEO of Borland , now CEO of Starfish . He plans to launch two Windows 95 programs in August . <p> " We 've invested a lot in Windows 95 products , we want to see a return on those investments . " <p> Tiny software maker MobileWare of Dallas , which had revenues of $ 1 million last year , estimates its Windows 95-linked programs will lead to a 500% rise in revenues . <p> But clouding all the industry euphoria is the Justice Department 's investigation . On-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to include the Microsoft Network software with Windows 95 gives it unfair advantage . <p> What Microsoft fears most is a suit by the Justice Department to force them to separate the Microsoft Network software from Windows 95 . Microsoft attorney Bill Neukom ( pronounced " nuke ' em " ) has vowed to fight any such request . " We feel we 're absolutely right on this one . " <p> If the department sues , Microsoft could launch Windows 95 without the MSN software and sell it separately . But that would be costly and might not be possible before Aug. 24 . Microsoft already has printed thousands of boxes and promotional literature touting the combined product . All that would have to be changed . <p> So " there could still be a delay , " says Brad Chase , head of Windows 95 marketing . But " we would have to see an injunction " before making firm decisions . <p> In any case , as Aug. 24 approaches , " there 's a lot of intensity " regarding the investigation , says Art Amolsch , editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-trust issues . " Like a heavyweight championship fight , this is a pretty good duke out . " <p> Experts expect Windows 95 to be a big seller : <p> Projected sales : ( in millions ) <p> 1995 29.4 1996 62.9 1997 83.9 <p> The number of online service subscribers is growing fast ( in millions ) ' 92 3.0 ' 93 3.5 ' 94 5.9 ' 95 9.0* ' 96 12.0* ' 97 15.5* <p> Microsoft is expected to join ranks of top on-line services : ( in millions ) CompuServ 3.2 America Online 3.0 Prodigy 1.6 * Year-end estimate
