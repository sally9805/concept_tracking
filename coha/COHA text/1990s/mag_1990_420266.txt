Section : RETIREMENT Despite the system 's much publicized woes , you are likely to get more than people retiring today do . <p> If you 're like many middle-class working Americans , you 're not overly optimistic about what you will eventually get from Social Security . In a recent poll of 300 MONEY subscribers conducted by the Gallup organization , 53% said that they believe benefit levels are likely to be cut for people who retire in the future , and 54% said they think that payouts could be eliminated for upper-income retirees . These concerns will only be worsened by discussions of Social Security cuts at budget deficit reduction talks now under way in Washington . <p> Is the widespread cynicism about Social Security justified ? To find out , MONEY undertook an extensive analysis of the system 's outlook . Our chief discovery may surprise you despite all the belt-tightening talk , your benefits will probably be higher than you expect . In fact , , you are likely to get more , in today 's dollars , than someone retiring now does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems will cause benefits to be cut  --  though not from this year 's levels or even from current levels adjusted for inflation . Few people realize that under the present law , annual benefits for people retiring in the future at age 65 will almost certainly be much higher than those received by today 's retirees ; it 's from those bountiful levels that the cuts will come . The reductions will take the form of increases in the normal retirement age ( to as high as 69 , according to our analysis ) and in taxes . In the MONEY/Gallup poll ( margin of error plus or minus six percentage points ) , 65% expected each of these changes . <p> Such cuts will not be painless . If you are 30 years old today and plan to retire at age 65 in 2025 , you are likely to receive only 80% of your full retirement benefits and to have 85% of what you get subject to income tax ( compared with a maximum of 50%. today ) . Nonetheless , payment levels at that time will be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 18% larger than a comparable 65-year-old today , even after inflation and taxes are taken into account . Your standard of living , however , is likely to be so much higher 35 years from now that Social Security will probably provide a smaller part of your retirement income . So you 'll have to rely more on other sources to maintain your pre-retirement living standard . <p> The table on page 94 shows how much you can expect to get if the Social Security system is amended in ways that appear most likely . Of course , forecasts are only educated guesses , and in this case they are based on economic , demographic and political assumptions . To appreciate why these assumptions translate into an ever-rising level of benefits , you have to understand how the system works . <p> Most people know that once they retire , their Social Security benefits will rise with inflation . But Social Security 's promise to current wage earners is more extravagant the system pledges to pay a starting benefit equal to a certain percentage of salary , up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the formula is tied to wages , which tend to outpace inflation , each new crop of retirees will start out at a higher level of real benefits than their predecessors did . The maximum age-65 payout in 2025 , for example , is projected to be $17,829 a year in 1990 dollars , compared with $11,700 today . <p> A problem will arise , however , when the baby-boom generation begins to file for retirement benefits around the year 2010 . Over the 20 years that follow , the ratio of Social Security taxpayers to beneficiaries will drop from around 3 to 1 to less than 2 to 1 , sending the program 's costs , relative to wages subject to Social Security taxes , soaring by 47% . If there are no further changes , costs will begin to exceed revenues around 2017 . <p> What happens then ? Many politicians believe that the system can plug the gap by drawing down the vast sums that will have accumulated in Social Security 's trust fund  --  essentially , the program 's bank account at the Treasury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit cuts enacted in 197 ' 7 and 1983 will raise much more money over the next few decades than the system needs . <p> This year , for example , workers will pay some $46 billion more in Social Security taxes than retirees will collect . Each year 's surplus fattens the trust fund , which could swell to around $7 trillion by 2017 , when the system starts to go into the red . In theory , the fund can then be tapped to cover annual deficits that will reach more than $387 billion in 2025 . <p> So the problem 's solved , right ? Wrong . The Social Security trust fund , it turns out , is a bookkeeping illusion . By law the trust fund must invest entirely in Treasury bonds . This is just another way of saying that the Treasury borrows the money  --  to spend on bombers , paper clips , congressmen 's junk mail and other routine government expenses  --  and issues the fund an IOU in return . If Social Security eventually cashes in the IOUs , taxpayers would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely supplements Social Security tax revenue with money from income and other taxes . " With or without a trust fund , the same amount has to be taken out of the taxpayers ' hands , " explains A. Haeworth Robertson , Social Security 's chief actuary in the mid-1970s and now a Washington consultant on retirement policy . <p> Obviously , the burden that the system will impose in the future depends in large part on trends in population  --  specifically the ratio of taxpayers to retirees . For the sake of consistency , this story relies on the Social Security Administration 's own demographic assumptions , such as a stable birth rate and increasing life expectancy for the elderly . <p> We also used Social Security 's own economic assumptions . The key one is that worker productivity will rebound from its depressed levels of the past two decades and increase by 1% to 2% a year ; it 's rising productivity that leads to higher wages . In the unlikely event that this expectation proves far too optimistic , the taxes required to support the system could double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the mark , at some point workers of the future will balk at the rising cost of maintaining the benefits now being promised . <p> Once it becomes evident that the system is going to drain hundreds of billions of dollars needed to fund other federal government programs , it is hard to imagine that taxpayers will not demand reform . The likely date a few years before 2017 , when Social Security 's finances swing into deficit . Says Carolyn Weaver , a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute " You can almost hear the slogan : Social Security has to pull its own weight . ' " <p> To keep the system on a pay-as-you-go basis , Congress will probably eliminate the deficit partly by cutting benefits and partly by hiking payroll taxes . A set of likely changes , developed for MONEY by Bruce D. Schobel , a former senior policy adviser with Social Security and now an actuary at New York Life , serves as the basis for our table on page 94 . The details : <p> The age at which new retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months each year starting in 2000 , until it reaches 69 in 2023 . <p> The fraction of benefits subject to income tax would rise from a maximum of 50% today to 85% , effective in 2025 . <p> The Social Security payroll tax would go up from 6.2% to 7% in 2025 . <p> The following describes the effects of these changes on three broad age groups . <p> If you are retired now or are planning to retire before 2000 : You have little to fear from changes in the Social Security law . Despite the current proposals to include benefit cuts in a budget accord that reduces the federal deficit , congressional inertia will probably postpone any serious action for 20 years . Because of the 1983 reforms , though , you may see more of your benefits taxed away . Under current law , up to half your benefits are subject to income tax if the sum of your non-Social Security income plus half your benefits exceeds $32,000 ( $25,000 it ' you are single ) . Unlike most other thresholds in the tax code , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income goes up along with the cost of living , an increasing portion of your benefits will be taxed . <p> If you are now between the ages of 37 and 52 . Sometime during your retirement , which will probably start between 2000 and 2018 , Congress and taxpayers will have to confront the shortfall in Social Security 's revenues . Chances are very good that your benefits will be stingier than the system is promising . <p> One such curtailment is already in the law the normal retirement age will creep up by two months a year between 2000 and 2005 , and again between 20517 and 2022 . In MONEY 'S forecast , the increases would continue between 2005 and 2017 and extend through 2023 . With that scenario , those workers now under 30 could not claim full benefits until they reached age 69 . <p> In either case , you will still be able to retire as early as 62 , but you would pay a bigger penalty than early retirees do now . For example , if you retire all 62 today , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your full benefits . If you are now 41 and you retire at 62 in 2011 , under current law you would get 75% . With the further tightening predicted by MONEY you 'd be entitled to just 70% . Similarly , if you are now 44 and you retire at 65 in 2011 , the current law would grant you 95% of your full benefits ; in MONEY 'S scenario , you 'd get 90% . Nonetheless , because of wage growth , you would still receive more , even after inflation , than someone retiring at 65 today . <p> If you are now 36 or younger : Today 's 36-year-olds , slated to start retiring in 2016 , are likely to file for benefits in the midst of a fierce national debate on Social Security reform . Whatever changes in the program are adopted , they will probably be phased in , granting those now in their mid-thirties or younger a few years to prepare . But the bulk of the new rules will almost certainly be in place by 2025 , the year today 's 30-year-olds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you retire at age 65 , your check will be only 80% of the full age-69 benefit , according to MONEY 's forecast . In addition , as much as 85% of what you receive will be taxable . But even so , annual wage growth of 5% to 6% between now and 2025 would push real , after-tax benefits nearly a fifth higher than those of workers retiring this year . <p> One note of caution although benefit levels will increase , they may not seem quite as munificent in 2025 as they would today . Thanks to rising wages , average 65-year-olds preparing to retire in 2025 will have incomes 57% greater than the average pre-retiree does now . So even though their pretax checks will be 30% higher , their benefits will amount to only about 36% of their lofty pre-retirement wages , compared with about 42% currently . Thus you may have to supplement Social Security with private pensions and savings to a greater degree than retirees do now , and you should factor that into your retirement planning . You are likely to enjoy a considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in retirement will depend increasingly on your own efforts . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Social Security works in mysterious ways workers contribute more in payroll taxes than is needed for benefits to retirees ... <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ... the extra money raised is lent to the government to help finance everything from the Pentagon to farm programs ... <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ... as today 's workers retire , the government will have to repay what it has borrowed  --  or benefits will have to be cut . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> by Eric Schurenberg <p> Reporter associate : Miriam A. Leuchter <p> WHAT SOCIAL SECURITY WILL PAY YOU AT AGE 65 <p> This table , prepared with the help of Ira Siegler , a partner at the benefits consulting firm Kwasha Lipton , compares the Social Security benefits that you are promised under current law with those that you would receive if the system is changed in ways that MONEY considers likely . Because MONEY is forecasting that taxes on Social Security will be increased , we show benefits on both a pretax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation , all amounts have been converted into today 's dollars . Workers destined to receive average benefits currently earn about $20,500 a year ; maximum payouts will go to those now making $51,300 or more .
