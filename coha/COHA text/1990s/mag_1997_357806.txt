Back when John Whitehead was a left-leaning student at the University of Arkansas and a writer for the local underground paper , he interviewed a young law professor named Bill Clinton who was planning to run for Congress . The idealistic Whitehead thought that Clinton could be another " people 's candidate , " like George McGovern , but he fretted to his interview subject that politicians often become " corrupt and phony . " Do n't worry , Clinton told Whitehead , " I wo n't let that happen to me . " <P> Twenty-three years later , Whitehead , now a born-again Christian , has some follow-up questions for Clinton . They have to do with Paula Jones . The Rutherford Institute , a legal-advocacy group he founded to fight discrimination against religious believers , has taken up Jones and her claim that Clinton made a crude sexual advance toward her six years ago , when he was Arkansas Governor . When Jones ' team of lawyers recently quit after she rejected a settlement offered by the President 's attorneys , it was Whitehead 's group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks mainly to Rutherford 's generous funding  --  Whitehead estimates its share of her court costs could add up to $200,000  --  Jones has been able to force the President , who denies the incident happened , to defend himself in a trial to begin in May . <P> Clinton 's embarrassment is a spectacle many conservative groups are relishing . But it 's not exactly a fight between church and state , which is what the Rutherford Institute more typically pursues . Since Whitehead founded it 15 years ago with $200 and his family 's Christmas-card list , the nonprofit foundation in Charlottesville , Va. , has generally stayed focused on what he says is " my calling from God "  --  to defend religious liberty against what he sees as government encroachment . In interviews and publications , the institute describes Christians as a besieged population assaulted by a coarse , secular culture and the government that fosters it . Dramatizations in the group 's Religious Apartheid video show bureaucrats dismantling a family and soldiers brainwashing a hapless father with four sinister buzz words of the secular world : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The institute pioneered the tactic of using constitutional free-speech guarantees as a legal weapon for people claiming they were denied the right to religious expression  --  a frequently successful court strategy now imitated by other religious-rights advocacy groups . Rutherford 's clients have included schoolchildren who wanted to pray over their lunches , a girl who wanted to read her Bible on the school bus and a Hindu who refused jury duty on religious grounds . The group also briefly considered defending Paul Hill , who was convicted of the 1994 murder of a doctor and another man at a Florida abortion clinic , but refused to argue , as Hill wanted , that the killing was justifiable homicide . " Violence never justifies violence . "
