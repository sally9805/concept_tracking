<p> Hobson City , Ala. - The smoke is almost suffocating above the rows of leathery-faced men and women listening nervously to the steady call of numbers over a loudspeaker at the I-20 Bingo Parlor . <p> " B-5 . " <p> " I-23 . " <p> The game is a $ 1,000 coverall , the biggest jackpot on this Tuesday night . The first person to cover all the numbers on a card wins . There are about 800 people , a small crowd compared with some weekends , when the jackpots reach $ 10,000 and tour buses bring up to 4,000 players from as far away as Ohio and the Carolinas . <p> " N-9 . " <p> " O-27 . " <p> " BINGO ! " <p> A woman shoots out of her chair , shouting , her cheeks pink . <p> The doors open every night at the I-20 Bingo Parlor , a massive , whitewashed building past the housing projects in Hobson City , a historically black town of 800 people , most of whom are poor , some of whom have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state maps , yet the tour-bus drivers know the route by heart . <p> Hobson City would seem lucky to have the bingo parlor , one of the biggest in the South . It pours an estimated $ 125,000 a year in taxes and fees into the town 's scanty coffers . <p> Others seem lucky as well . One of the parlor 's primary financial beneficiaries has been the South 's only full-service rural AIDS clinic , located in a plain brick building just down the road . <p> For a while , in fact , it seemed the ideal situation : an isolated bingo parlor that draws gamblers from throughout the South would plow profits back into an AIDS clinic that provided treatment for impoverished patients throughout east Alabama and west Georgia . <p> But some people at the clinic are beginning to question their luck , as well as the motives of the bingo parlor operators . <p> AIDS clinic officials have reported to the Internal Revenue Service what they regard as improprieties by the bingo parlor , questioning whether the gambling operation has used the clinic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is investigating . <p> The marriage of the bingo parlor and the AIDS clinic was consummated by mutual need . <p> The clinic needed money , the bingo parlor needed a charity to stay in business under a new county law . And Hobson City , unable to attract industry and burdened by unemployment and poverty , needed bingo to survive . <p> Hobson City could be compared to Indian tribes , such as the Poarch Creek in Atmore , Ala. , which operate bingo from reservations : A needy minority turns to bingo for financial salvation . <p> But Native American bingo is protected by federal law , while the I- 20 Bingo Parlor is protected only by Hobson City , where it is the primary breadwinner . <p> " This has the making of one of those TV movies , " says Deborah Wade , executive director of the AIDS clinic . " A small Southern town in Alabama , the blacks , the whites , the crime , the money , the AIDS . It 's just unreal . " <p> The clinic and the parlor came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-20 Bingo , approached the fledgling AIDS clinic , which was then no more than a support group starved for cash . <p> The bingo parlor had been open for years , but a new Calhoun County law required that bingo must be nonprofit and for charity . <p> To comply with this law , the parlor offered to pay the AIDS clinic $ 2,500 a month as a " charitable donation . " <p> This appeared to make everything legal for I-20 Bingo . Neither partner knew much about the other , but once a month a woman named Maria would call down from the bingo parlor and say , " We 've got y'all 's money , " Mrs. Wade said . <p> Someone from the clinic would go and fetch wads of cash , usually thrown into a sticky cardboard Coca-Cola box , Mrs. Wade said . <p> By 1991 , the AIDS clinic had evolved from a counseling group into a full-blown medical clinic with an office in nearby Oxford , Ala. , where AIDS patients could see a doctor , pyschotherapist or counselor . Grants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grateful Dead . The clinic had just won a three-year federal Ryan White AIDS grant worth nearly $ 800,000 and could finally afford to pay some of its small staff . <p> In November 1991 , Brent Middlebrook , the clinic 's accountant , went to register the clinic 's three employees for payroll taxes at the federal building in nearby Anniston . <p> " Would that be three more employees above the 42 already working there ? " the clerk at the federal building asked the accountant , according to clinic officials . <p> " What 42 employees ? " Mr. Middlebrook responded , dumbfounded . <p> " You 've got 42 employees you 've been taking out payroll taxes on , " the clerk said . The records showed 42 employees registered to ASK Inc. , the official name of the nonprofit AIDS clinic . <p> But the address and telephone number listed for ASK Inc. belonged to the I-20 Bingo Parlor . The parlor had been using the clinic 's nonprofit tax identification number for its own payroll taxes , according to Mrs. Wade . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White money bought expensive medical equipment , brochures and other supplies , but every day brought more HIV positive people . <p> The clinic 's caseload nearly tripled , to 110 patients by the end of 1992 . <p> " There was a sense certainly in the medical community that there was n't much HIV infection around , " said Dr. Barbara Hanna , the clinic 's doctor . " It was obvious to me there was much more disease than people were aware of . " <p> The clinic and parlor drew closer together in late 1991 when the lease expired on the Oxford office , and the clinic , at the invitation of Mr. Holloway , moved to Hobson City . Mr. Holloway agreed to raise the clinic 's monthly " donation " by $ 300 to meet the rent and offered to pick up utilities , Mrs. Wade said . <p> But , within days of starting work , Mrs. Wade said things began to look suspicious . Mrs. Wade said she discovered the bingo parlor had opened a bank account in the clinic 's name . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic 's bulk-rate stamp , the special discount postage rate given to all nonprofit groups . <p> " You already picked up your stamp , " the postal teller told Mrs. Wade . <p> " They were using our nonprofit bulk-rate mailing permit and sending bingo leaflets to North Carolina and South Carolina , " Mrs. Wade said . <p> Bingo became Topic A at the board meetings of the clinic , which did not want to endanger its nonprofit status or risk losing its federal grant . <p> At one meeting , Mrs. Wade says , Cecil Barnes , the man who runs the nightly bingo game and served on the clinic 's board , stood up and said : <p> " You can stretch the rubber band of the law as far as you want to stretch it . We 've been good to you . You did n't have anything before us . " <p> An attorney for the AIDS clinic said the clinic would need to oversee I-20 Bingo in order for the arrangement to be legal . The 1990 local law also dictated that all profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One estimate by clinic officials had I-20 Bingo making $ 2.5 million one year , far more than the monthly $ 2,800 " donation . " <p> " Y'all ai n't gon na run my bingo parlor , and you ai n't gon na see my books , " Mr. Barnes said , according to Mrs. Wade . <p> The board removed Mr. Barnes in June 1992 and severed ties with the bingo parlor . But the marriage would not end so easily .
