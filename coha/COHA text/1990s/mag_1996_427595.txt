Section : U.S. News More campaign money than ever is flooding into Washington , but do n't bet on a cleanup <p> The events of the past election might seem to add up to a powerful argument for campaign finance reform . President Clinton 's campaign was marred by a scandal involving the influence of foreign money , an intrigue that is likely to dog him well into 1997 . The overall cost of races for federal office was staggering  --  a record $1.7 billion spent to elect the president and members of Congress . Of that amazing haul , corporations , labor unions and fat cats helped kick in more than $220 million through the back door of so-called soft-money contributions , skirting legal donation limits . Millions more were spent by interest groups not directly linked to candidates or parties but whose media efforts were meant to help elect candidates . <p> Correlating political corruption with campaign spending is an imprecise exercise at best , but there is ample evidence that the current system forces politicians to spend far too much time panhandling prior to elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , however , reformersbelieve they have a rare chance to shame Congress into repairing long-obvious problems in federal campaign laws . " I predicted a major scandal would be the catalyst , " says one of the reformers , John McCain , the Republican senator from Arizona . " I do not underestimate the challenge here , but I do believe there is widespread distaste and anger about the present system . " <p> McCain and Russell Feingold , a Democratic senator from Wisconsin , back a comprehensive plan that would , among other reforms , ban soft money . But if the past is any guide , they are in for a rough ride . Campaign finance reform was killed in the Senate last summer , the victim of a concerted lobbying effort by business , unions and others who disagree on most issues but share a stake in the current financing system . For two decades , Congress and a succession of presidents have promised change but failed to deliver . Obstacles include courts wary of limits on spending , creative lawyers paid to find fresh loopholes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can command large donations from special interests more easily than their opponents ; they favor the system that favors them . <p> Going soft . The last time meaningful reform became law was after Watergate . The change limited individual campaign contributions to $1,000 per candidate and provided public funds for presidential elections . It also created the Federal Election Commission to monitor all federal campaigns . Since then , however , when Congress has changed the campaign laws , it has only made the problem worse . <p> It was Congress , after all , that opened the system to soft money . " This is a way for the special interests to have a back door to the politicians , " explains Charles Lewis , an ethics expert in Washington . Federal law , designed originally to limit the influence of bank and other corporate interests , bars direct corporate and labor-union contributions to federal campaigns . But a 1979 provision allows the national political parties to collect unlimited amounts of money from corporations , unions and wealthy donors for use in party-building activities such as get-out-the-vote drives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not supposed to be used in federal campaigns . <p> But used they are . In this year 's election , both parties used soft money to influence the congressional and presidential races . Together the party committees raised at least $223.4 million in soft money during 1995 and 1996 , according to FEC reports , three times more than in the last presidential election . For example , tobacco giant Philip Morris and its affiliates and executives gave $2.2 million to Republicans and $480,000 to Democrats , according to a study done by the Center for Responsive Politics , a campaign watchdog group in the nation 's capital . In the waning days of the campaign , the parties scrambled to raise soft money , tapping 36 donors for contributions of $50,000 or more , says Common Cause , another citizens ' group . The Democrats got $80,000 from television producer Norman Lear and $100,000 from financier George Soros . Republicans tapped Alfa Insurance Corp . for $100,000 and North Carolina-based First Union Corp . for $99,000 . <p> Although other reform bills will be offered in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would make three big changes in the present system . Besides prohibiting soft money , it would try to outlaw political action committees , which corporations and unions use to circumvent the ban on direct giving to campaigns . And it would create a system of voluntary spending limits , coupled with incentives like free and discounted television time and reduced postage rates . <p> But plugging any one loophole may simply shunt the flow of money to other spending schemes . Issue-advocacy campaigns would most likely be one avenue . Under current law , a group running an issue-advertising campaign may not coordinate it with a particular candidate or urge citizens to vote for or against an office seeker . As long as those rules are respected , the effort is considered to be entirely outside the campaign finance system . There are no limits on donations and no requirements to identify donors . This year , the AFL-CIO ran a controversial $35 million issue-advocacy campaign to help Democrats win back the House . Only a court ruling could prohibit that kind of spending , which is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign money may not be simple either . Some seeps into campaigns illegally , as illustrated by the controversy over the Democrats ' efforts to raise money from Asian backers . Under federal campaign laws , however , it is legal for resident aliens to contribute . U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companiescan also make soft-money donations or give through political action committees as long as the funds were earned in the United States . According to the Center for Responsive Politics , foreign-owned American companies made at least $7 million in contributions in the past two years . The biggest giver was Joseph E. Seagram &; Sons , the U.S. branch of a Canadian company . Seagram and its affiliates and executives gave $1.9 million , the center reported . <p> McCain and Feingold offer a simple fix  --  if you ca n't vote , you ca n't give  --  but the problem is more complicated . That fix would limit gifts by individuals but not those of major corporations controlled by foreign companies . " That 's a tricky area , " says Feingold , who plans to study it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation and already have obtained pledges of support from some congressional leaders and President Clinton . But Mitch McConnell , the Kentucky Republican who led the Senate fight against campaign reform this year , vows to do so again , and all he needs for a filibuster to work is 41 votes . Opponents say citizens have the right to spend money as they wish to promote their views , and each party is wary of reforms that might give the other an edge . Republicans , for instance , do not want to create a system that hurts their givers but fails to rein in union donations . <p> Some powerful special interests can be expected to line up against reform . Last year , the National Association of Business PACs sent a letter to members of Congress suggesting they might be targets of a negative print and radio ad campaign NABPAC was undertaking . The ad listed the sponsors of campaign finance reform in the House and told listeners : " The next time you see these co-sponsors ... ask them this simple question : Why Do You Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among others , Linda Smith , a Washington State Republican who sponsored the bill and barely survived her re-election effort . NABPAC members include some powerful trade groups , among them the National Association of Realtors and the American Medical Association , both big-time contributors to congressional candidates . " They 'll be out in great force , " Feingold says . " They 'll pass it off as a problem of foreign money only . " But he adds , " I do n't care if a $400,000 check comes from Jakarta or Janesville , Wis . No one should give that amount of money . " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Edward T. Pound and Bruce B. Auster <p> Moneyman IN THE EYE OF THE STORM <p> John Huang 's world is a web of connections . The central figure in the foreign-money fund-raising scandal , he is a presidential pal , a former executive of the Lippo Bank in Los Angeles and an acquaintance of several Arkansas lawyers and businessmen who are friends of the Clintons and have tried to strike it rich in Asia . <p> Investigators are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by raising campaign funds for Democrats during the 17 months he served at the Department of Commerce . The 67 pages of records from Huang 's telephone at Commerce could offer some clues . He made more than 70 calls to his associates at the Lippo Bank and at least 100 calls to the circle of Arkansans who , after Clinton 's election in 1992 , transformed themselves into international business consultants . <p> Questions . After he left the Commerce Department early this year , Huang went to the Democratic National Committee , where he raised $2.5 million . More than $1 million has since been returned after questions arose about the sources of the funds . Huang has also donated $122,375 to Democrats since 1986 . <p> Investigators have other questions about possible links between the Commerce Department and Democratic Party fund-raisers . The phone records , for instance , show that Huang called Tulsa-based Dynamic Energy Resources , whose principals weremajor Democratic contributors . The company 's president then was Michael Brown , son of the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
