Susan Webb 's new book , Step Forward , ( MasterMedia ; $9.95 ) will not hit the stores for another week or so , but already her publisher is fielding a dozen requests a day for bulk orders . Among the eager buyers : Heublein , Bristol- Myers and Avon . The first book about sexual harassment published since the Thomas hearings , Webb 's book is refreshingly free of ideology and reproach . A longtime human-relations expert and specialist on this subject , Webb wrote Step Forward at breakneck speed , sending in a chapter a day . <P> The result is an accessible sort of Cliffs Notes guide to the topic that will have special appeal for managers concerned about this stubborn workplace plague , especially now that litigation is raising the ante of ignorance . But harassers and victims  --  as well as the great mass of confused bystanders  --  will also find it informative . Crisp and logical , Webb 's book explains what sexual harassment is , how to recognize it , how to know if you 're doing it and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sexual harassment remains a loaded topic that can rupture friendships and plunge victims into self-doubt . Many people do n't understand what it is . Certainly men and women viewing the same incident often disagree on whether anything untoward  --  not to mention illegal  --  has occurred . Is it ordinary flirtation ? Is it old-fashioned earthy humor between friends of opposite sex ? No , says Webb . Most men do not sexually harass their co-workers . Those who do are engaging in a power trip that plays on sex ; work-related strings are attached . Says she : " It 's really not difficult to understand . You just have to stop and think about it . " <P> Organizing Step Forward somewhat like a classroom workbook , Webb comes across more like a friendly high school teacher than a corporate consultant , lacing her account with anecdotes and case studies . Examples : <P> 1 ) You and your boss are single and like each other a lot . You invite him to dinner , and one thing leads to another . Was someone sexually harassed ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> 2 ) Your boss invites you to a restaurant for dinner and  --  much to your surprise  --  spends the evening flirting with you . Just before inviting you to her house for a nightcap , she mentions that promotion you are hoping to get . ( You are being sexually harassed . Whether or not you welcome her interest in you , she has implied a connection between the promotion and your response . ) <P> Think this does n't go on where you work ? Two-thirds of the men in a Harvard Business Review study said reports of sexual harassment at work are greatly exaggerated . But surveys have shown that 90% of FORTUNE 500 companies have dealt with sexual-harassment complaints , and nearly 25% have been sued repeatedly . More than half of U.S. women executives say they have suffered the abuse . And it is hardly an American problem . Sexual harassment at work was reported by 70% of Japanese women in one study and by nearly 50% of the women in a survey of several European countries . Not to mention the 15% of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb reports that absenteeism , lost productivity and turnover caused by harassment are costing large companies an average of $282.53 per employee per year . Solution : knock it off . It pays .
