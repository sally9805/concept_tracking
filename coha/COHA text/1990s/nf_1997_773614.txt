" 57 Eventually Curwood became an editor of the Sunday edition as well as a special writer , his salary reaching $30 a week . All the while he was soaking up material he marketed in freelance stories and articles to magazines and other papers . When Munsey 's took a Great Lakes adventure yarn , " Captain of the Christopher Duggan , " for $75 ( with a note from Frank Munsey saying " At last ? good boy !

In stories and articles he developed a reputation as a specialist in two areas ? the danger and romance of shipping on the Great Lakes and rugged outdoor adventure in the far north . Editors began asking for material and he started a novel and a juvenile serial . By 1907 , in his late twenties , he was selling to McCall 's , Red Book , and Cosmopolitan as well as Munsey 's , working on books , and holding down his newspaper job while squeezing in as much time as possible for Great Lakes and wilderness excursions . Because of his northwoods stories and articles the Canadian government hired him as a public relations writer to promote settlement in its western regions , paying $1,800 a year plus expenses and providing free railway passes . Then Bobbs-Merrill in Indianapolis accepted a hunting book for boys , The Wolf Hunters , and issued a contract calling for five more juvenile books .

" 5 ' Curwood returned to his hometown of Owosso , Michigan , built a house for himself and his second wife , and settled down as a full-time independent writer . With his Bobbs-Merrill books he followed the time 's common practice of magazine serialization before book publication ? the practice that brought him , together with numerous film scenarios , films made from his works , and films he produced himself , a considerable fortune . His subject matter was set as well when he followed the advice of a Munsey 's editor that he had a " good field in the Northern wilderness of Canada . That novel atmosphere helps sell your stories ? stay with what works for you . " 60 He toiled up to twelve hours a day at his desk while letting editors clean up his casual grammar , spelling , and // messy typescripts ( later a series of hired secretaries undertook the chores ) .

Curwood had submitted a story about a part-wolf sled dog named Kazan that caught the editor 's attention . Long had read stories by Curwood in other magazines but none struck him as particularly good ; " Kazan , " on the other hand , was the best dog story he had read , and he urged the writer to produce more.6 ' When Curwood sent him a series of connected stories about Kazan , Long took them all at $300 apiece . Published in book form in 1914 , Kazan had a slow beginning . Curwood later said of the book that he had hoped to match the success of London 's White Fang and Call of the Wild , and though this failed to happen the work over the years proved one of his most enduring moneymakers . He kept writing for other magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post , Leslie 's , and Collier 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the connection with Long , who eventually switched to the Hearst publications as editor in chief , was central . With William Randolph Hearst 's blessing a scheme was worked out that called for Curwood 's animal stories to run in Cosmopolitan , novels in Good Housekeeping , and other stories in either Cosmopolitan or Harper 's Bazaar . Cosmopolitan was also going to publish in book form a small list of its own novels , no more than six a year , and for Curwood 's would pay $5,000 upon publication and royalties of a whopping 20 percent . It was a program , Long gushed , that " no publishing house has ever done before , " and he promised Curwood " advertising beyond your dreams . " 62 By 1920 , with nineteen books and dozens of stories and articles behind him , Curwood was entering into a decade of major popularity . His per-word rate for magazine serials was said to equal if not surpass that of any writer , this for works ? as Ray Long recalled ? that were " more nearly sure-fire circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 63 Published in book form , such novels of northern adventure coupled with chaste romance as The River 's End , The Valley of Silent Men , and A Gentleman of Courage were major best sellers . Yet as his reputation soared during the twenties Curwood 's career was winding down . Although Long described him as " tall , wiry , outdoorsy in every line and movement , " Curwood 's health was poor . With editors urging him to work less even while soliciting new stories , he began devoting large // chunks of time to a passionate concern with conservation issues in Michigan . He was appointed to the Conservation Commission by the governor , using the position as a pulpit to rail against bad conservation practices while predicting a time when the northern part of the state would rival Yellowstone as an outdoor attraction . In 1926 Curwood gave his recipe for good health in a fate-tempting article in Hearst 's magazine called " I Shall Live To Be too . " A year later he was dead from kidney problems at age forty-nine . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounted his friendship with the writer ? and took note of the fanciful stone castle Curwood had built for himself in Owosso as a writing studio and his equally fanciful log lodge in the Michigan woods near Roscommon that , true to the primitive northwoods aura of Curwood 's fiction , had no electricity or running water . Later , in a collection of stories in which he included " Kazan , " Long remembered Curwood 's growth " from rather an obscure writer of adventure stories to a writer who was recognized , at the time of his death , as being one of the world 's foremost advocates of living close to nature . " He added : " He wrote melodrama , yes ; there were action and vigor and at times brutality in his stories ; he was far from being the greatest psychologist who ever wrote ; but he was sincere , he loved nature , he made you love nature .

McClure one In 1899 , his career just underway , Jack London asked Cloudesley Johns for information about S.S. McClure 's newspaper syndicate : " Suppose McClure 's magazine had accepted that study of yours . Would they have published it in the magazine , or would it have come out in some newspaper through the syndicate ? I am always afraid to send McClures sic anything that I consider good , for fear they will publish it through the syndicate , which syndicate I know nothing about . Can you enlighten me ? " ' Soon enough London discovered for himself the main thing he needed to know about McClure 's syndicate and others like it : they were a significant way of bolstering his writing income . " ' Then there are the newspaper syndicates , and the newspaper short-story syndicates , and the syndicates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // realize . " I can go ahead and hammer out the stuff they want , and earn the equivalent of a good salary by it . " 2 If writers had misgivings about journalism as an avenue to the writing life , they had reason only to welcome the benefits offered by newspaper publication with the rise at the end of the nineteenth century of syndicates specializing in literary material . Here was a major new market rather than a springboard to established markets ; and here was a means of advancing name recognition through widespread newspaper readership while retaining a freelancer 's freedom . Writers for the syndicates were in the world of daily and weekly newspaper journalism while happily free of its workaday grasp . Auxiliary news services for weekly and provincial newspapers first appeared in England . In America rival services began operating in the Civil War period , supplying ready-print sheets of news , miscellaneous features , and advertising , the material pre-printed on one side with the other left blank for local printing . " Patent insides , " as they were called , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that could be shipped throughout the country and locally printed . In 1871 Ansel Nash Kellogg 's Chicago-based Newspaper Company ? the first syndicate independent of a parent newspaper ? introduced serial fiction to syndication , and the following year illustrated articles. ; In an advertisement in 1875 the rival American Newspaper Union listed the range of reading matter it provided the country press as " state news and legislative reports , a full summary of general news , late and correct market quotations , an agricultural department , a department for young folks , and a good story for everybody . " 4 Missing from the inventory was a poetry column , a ubiquitous syndicate offering . Although the quantity and quality of magazine poetry was said to be in decline ( the Saturday Evening Post editorialized in 1898 on the " Twilight of Poetry " ) , newspaper poetry flourished during the period , with nearly every paper offering a column of popular verse and some writers achieving national reputations . Edgar A. Guest , among the best known , spent his entire career with the Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . Newspapers that did not conduct their own poetry department typically depended on syndicated material . Beginning in 1884 Ella Wheeler Wilcox , who had made her name with a faintly risque collection called Poems of Passion in 1876 , wrote a poem a day for newspaper syndication as part of a career in popular verse that spanned more than forty years and included over forty books . Sam Walter Foss produced a poem a week for syndication between 1887 and 1893 , whereupon he began a one-a-day schedule that he kept to over the next // twenty years . In Sinclair Lewis 's Babbitt , Zenith 's poetaster , T. Cholmondeley Frink , has had his poem " Poemulations " syndicated in sixty-seven leading newspapers , giving him " one of the largest audiences of any poet in the world . " Another character , Vergil Gunch , adds that in terms of literary productivity even Dante " would n't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to practical literature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every day , like Chum does ! " 5 By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of readyprint copy in their columns . Soon syndicates expanded by providing literary material as well as the work of popular columnists and humorists to small-city and metropolitan dailies , and it was here that Sam McClure found his niche with a literary service . As he recalled in his autobiography , his plan had the beauty of simplicity : " I could get a short story from any of the best story-writers then for $15o . I figured that I ought to be able to sell that story to Too newspapers throughout the country , at $5 each . News was syndicated in this way , and I did not see why fiction should not be . " 6 While McClure was confident a newspaper literary syndicate would succeed , others were not . An early version of his plan , this one calling for syndicating previously published juvenile stories among country papers , was broached to the Century Company in New York , publisher of the Century magazine . McClure , working as an editorial assistant with the firm , hoped the scheme would be his ticket to success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newspaper editors around the country took advantage of lax copyright laws and clipped what they wanted out of magazines and rival papers . Why would they pay for what they already took free ? And would writers agree , despite the added income and wider circulation a syndicate would bring them , to have their work appear in lowly newspapers rather than prestigious journals ? In England , George Gissing sniffed that he would " never dream of writing a story for a newspaper syndicate ; the kind of stuff they publish , and the way they advertise it , is too ignoble . " 7 McClure 's college friend and later business associate , John Phillips , thought the enterprise decidedly flawed on this score . He informed McClure that the syndicate scheme " seems to me too extensive to be feasible . Even if the capital &c; were secured , I doubt if the best American writers would agree to put themselves under such bonds for any length of time . . . . And then I surmise that many would object to the manner of publication ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speaking of price ) to publish once in a choice journal like Century to a broader circulation through the medium of and and 3rd rate papers . Of // course by this the writers would receive larger remuneration for stories , but that is not all they look at . " A McClure understood better than Phillips , and better than the Century Company , the role of remuneration in the lives of writers , and pressed on with the plan as a business venture of his own . In a circular mailed to editors around the country in October 1884 he announced his syndicate was open for business : I have made arrangements with a number of our most popular authors , including W. D. Howells , H. C. Bunner , J. S. of Dale , Mrs. Helen Jackson , Mrs. Harriet Prescott Spofford , Dr. William A. Hammond , and over a score of others , to furnish serial and short stories for simultaneous publication in syndicates of leading newspapers . This method of publication has been employed very successfully in England and France for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers should not reap great advantages from a similar arrangement . A dozen , or twenty , or fifty newspapers ? selected so as to avoid conflict in circulation ? can thus secure a story for a sum which will be very small for each paper , but which will in the aggregate be sufficiently large to secure the best work by the best authors . A small outlay will enable a newspaper to furnish its readers with stories by our most noted writers , which have not been published before , and which will be accessible to its readers in no other periodical.9 Rather than " over a score " of writers , all McClure had at the start were commitments from a few , together with his tireless zeal in promoting the syndicate . For capital to purchase material he planned on using money that came in from the papers buying the service ; this arrangement in turn depended on the willingness of writers to accept delayed payment or a portion of their money paid on account . That several were in fact willing can be attributed in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to the access he was providing to a fresh market for previously rejected work or work in a vein unlikely to be accepted by the dominant magazines of the time . A letter McClure sent to a large number of possible contributors as the syndicate was getting underway indicated its seductive appeal to professional writers : " I shall need between 300 and 400 stories during the year , and can profitably use all the stories you will write for the newspaper press . . . . I will meet your views . Please let me know your terms , the number of stories you will write this year ( 1885 ) , and the probable length of the stories . " io To handle the costly problem of duplicating stories , McClure hit on the idea of supplying his service free to one newspaper that set material from the author 's copy and then supplied the syndicate with a number of galley proofs , distributing the proofs // in turn to other newspapers as setting copy . Newspapers that bought the service were guaranteed exclusive rights to material within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular to editors suggest , the stories offered by the Associated Literary Press ? its formal name until 1900 when it became the McClure Newspaper Syndicate ? were regular magazine fare from the recognized authors of the day . As time went on the syndicate supplied more varied material that included stories by the new realists and naturalists . From newspaper editors who either took or rejected stories McClure had instant reaction to the material he circulated , putting him in a better position to read public taste than insulated magazine editors . What editors repeatedly told him they wanted was something fresh ? and something geared to newspaper audiences . " Some of the daily stories you send out are fossil chestnuts from the antediluvian strata of literature , " one informed him . " The new authors excite more interest than the old stand bys , " another said . " You get more originality with the new writers . . . . A reader of a short story in a daily newspaper cares very little about literary polish . He only wants to be interested or amused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market brought about by syndicates such as McClure 's , lamented the quality of the work that was sought precisely on these grounds . " In fact , " he noted , " the newspapers prefer to remain newspapers , at least in quality if not in form . " What they wanted in fiction was " something sensational " rather than something artistic ; " they wanted their emotions raw , or at least saignantes from the joint of fact , and not prepared by the fancy or the taste . " ll McClure himself had neither time nor inclination to trouble over such niceties . He had a growing business on his hands , and as he expanded the types of stories circulated by the syndicate he also branched out into material other than fiction . The number of newspapers printed in the country was expanding ; at the same time newspaper size was increasing and Sunday editions were gaining popularity . Editors , faced with filling the new space as cheaply as possible , especially the yawning pages of Sunday editions , turned to McClure and he supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serialized novels . ( Howells thought the fact that syndicate fiction was heavily used in Sunday papers also worked against quality material . He argued ? with considerable strain ? that women , " who form the largest , if not the only cultivated class among us , " tended to dismiss the Sunday paper " except for its social gossip , " with the result that " its fiction is mainly of the inferior sort with which boys and men beguile their leisure . " ) ' 3 When papers wanted cooking // articles McClure whipped them up himself under the pseudonym " Patience Winthrop , " a name he hoped conjured up a New England housewife . Popular humorists like Opie Read and Bill Nye came on board , happy to have their work copyrighted and syndicated as a measure of protection against what Nye called the pastepot-and-scissors fiends at work on country weeklies . A series of articles on Mormonism by Kate Field , a prominent Washington journalist , was one of the syndicate 's early triumphs . The popular religious novelist E. P. Roe offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it began , McClure 's syndicate was selling some fifty thousand words a week to over a hundred papers . McClure was also altering the familiar writer-editor relationship . By nature he belonged , as Hamlin Garland remarked , to the " conquering side of the editors ' guild . " i4 He refused to wait for material to appear in the mail but hunted it out , buying mostly on an author 's reputation or on recommendations , while also spinning out ideas to writers and commissioning material . He had his rivals , especially a syndicate run by a former New York journalist , Irving Bacheller , and this spurred on his restless literary scouting parties . In a six-year period from 1887 to 1893 he made eight round trips across the Atlantic and an equal number of journeys across the United States ? a man , as commentators on his life have noted , meant for the jet age but imprisoned in the age of steam . In his search for fresh material he met with nearly every writer of note from Ned Buntline to Henry James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England he garnered for the syndicate the work of such major figures as Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy as well as the American expatriates James , Bret Harte , and Harold Frederic . His second-in-command in America , John Phillips , was advised to publicize the new stable of authors " so that Bacheller will not write to them &; perhaps make tremendous offers , after they have engaged to me at quite moderate sums , as I hope . " In a subsequent letter Phillips was told that " Bacheller is utterly routed &; badly beaten .... Success , absolute &; cloudless , is ours . " 15 Another rival , Edward Bok , began his syndicate by locating newspaper needs not served by McClure and Bacheller.16 He circulated a weekly letter by the famed preacher Henry Ward Beecher , then followed it up ? as the Bok Syndicate Press ? with material aimed at women . He supplied a weekly letter from New York and engaged Ella Wheeler Wilcox for another weekly letter on specific women 's topics ; soon he had an entire page of material for women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rights for what became known as a " Bok Page " had to develop women 's pages of their own . Another // successful feature of the syndicate was a chatty New York ? based literary letter , " Bok 's Literary Leaves . " After he became editor of the Ladies ' Home Journal in 1889 Bok closed his literary syndicate , leaving the field largely to Bacheller and McClure . By its nature the business was a furious treadmill . New names and new material had to be continually injected into the operation , with at least one surprise offering each month and a spectacular offering every November when a fresh season was launched . Always new clients had to be attracted , old ones retained . As the literary syndicates became established features of daily papers and Sunday editions , their mass-production needs were prime targets for satirists . James L. Ford took aim at McClure : I paid a visit yesterday to the model village of Syndicate , founded by Mr. S. S. McClure for the benefit of the literary hands employed in his great enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neatness , order and the completeness of its sanitary arrangements it is infinitely superior to the similar towns of Pullman or any of the colonies established by the late Baron Hirsch ... . At one o'clock the factory whistle blew again and the men returned to their work . Mr. McClure took me through one of the large buildings and explained every detail of the work to me . Every morning the foreman goes from bench to bench and gives an idea to each author . Just before noon he passes along again and carefully examines the unfinished work , and , late in the afternoon , a final inspection is made , after which the goods are packed and sent down to the wharf for shipment . I inquired whether there was any truth in the report that several authors had been taken with severe illness immediately after beginning work at Syndicate , whereupon the foreman explained that this had happened several times , but it had always resulted from giving an author a whole idea all at once ? something to which few of them had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Home for Literary Incurables . The need for a continuous supply of fresh material caused McClure to steadily inflate his prices , a boon to authors but a practice that kept the syndicate on the brink of financial ruin . Richard Harding Davis , then just beginning his wondrous career , turned down a $50-a-week offer to write a syndicated letter but shortly thereafter sold his tale " The Reporter Who Made Himself King " for syndication for $300 . To Twain , McClure paid $I , 000 apiece for syndication rights to a half-dozen letters from Europe while Howells received $IO , 000 for rights to a novel . To Robert Louis Stevenson , the writer McClure considered his grandest catch , he paid out even more . Eventually it // became clear that something other than a newspaper syndicate was needed if McClure was to fully profit from his investments . A national magazine , with the potential for a rich stream of advertising revenue , beckoned ? a publication that in later years he would think of as his " syndicate work grown up . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication in the depression year of 1893 . As newspapers felt the pinch of hard times they cut back on the use of syndicates and withheld money they already owed ; but despite a lack of funds McClure pushed ahead , using reprint material from the syndicate for the magazine and signing up new writers with payment in stock in the venture . Henry Drummond , a Scottish theologian and scientist who wrote popular articles on evolution , turned over a $3,000 fee for delivering the Lowell Lectures in Boston in return for stock in the magazine . When Hamlin Garland was offered stock in lieu of payment , he declined ? to his lasting regret . Conan Doyle invested $5,000 in the magazine , just the sum McClure needed to pay off a debt he had run up to English authors . A year into publication the magazine was losing $I , 000 a week but gaining in circulation and reputation . It carried fiction by regional writers such as Octave Thanet ( pen name of Alice French ) , Sarah Orne Jewett , and Joel Chandler Harris as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClure was using his interventionist manner as an editor to create a fresh kind of topical journalism . The magazine was meant to have the up-to-date quality of a " monthly newspaper " ; it offered itself , as Garland put it , " as a bold and enterprising truth dispenser " to the masses.i9 To that end McClure spun out ideas for articles , found writers to carry them through , and attached the writers to the magazine as staff members or contributing editors . Unsolicited manuscripts were also welcomed , the magazine announcing in its columns that " we are glad to receive and examine contributions of any sort within the scope of the magazine ? short stories and historical , scientific , and other special articles . " The magazine added that it had a standing prize of a staff position for the " special writer who can prove his right to it " Z. ? a right established , though the magazine left the requirement unspecified , by capturing the attention of the dynamic owner . By the decade 's end McClure 's circulation had soared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely in the hands of family memWRITING // bers ) was grossing $50,000 a year , and McClure had branched out into profitable book publishing with the creation of Doubleday and McClure . The firm offered another means of attracting the services of authors for the magazine and syndicate operations . After reading Frank Norris 's novel Moran of the Lady Letty in serial form in a California publication , McClure brought the writer to New York as an assistant in the publishing firm , with his mornings spent in editorial work and his afternoons left free for writing . For some time fiction had been coming directly to the magazine rather than from syndicate files , and Norris was added to an impressive roster of new young writers that included Garland , London , Dreiser , Booth Tarkington , and O. Henry . McClure also showered his fiction writers with article possibilities while at the same time securing for the magazine a group of nonfiction specialists that included Ida M. Tarbell , William Allen White , Will Irwin , Lincoln Steffens , and Ray Stannard Baker ( who also served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newspaper syndicate and turned out stories on scientific subjects for syndicate circulation ) . The idea of a staff of fact writers was a McClure inspiration . Nonfiction was ordinarily accepted on magazines on the same freelance basis as fiction , but McClure wanted more control over articles than the prevailing practice allowed . He had firm notions about subjects and how articles should be written . To get what he wanted he set about attaching writers to the magazine on a full-time basis ? uncertain at first whether they should be called associate editors , staff writers , or staff associates ? then showered them with ideas and his relentless enthusiasm . Ellery Sedgwick , who toiled for McClure 's before becoming owner-editor of the Atlantic , remembered what it was like : " Everyone about him caught fire and he would inflame the intelligence of his staff into molten excitement . The mood would be too hot to last but would bring results . Should anyone object that another magazine had printed an article on the very subject he was suggesting , the chief would run his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other magazines have told that story . You are wrong . A story is never told till McClure tells it . " ' 21 Over the years McClure 's gained a reputation as a magazine that valued writers and writing , and with good reason its proprietor could say that his real capital in starting the magazine had been his " wide acquaintance with writers and with what they could produce . " He could similarly boast that through his syndicate and magazine he could win for new writers a public larger than that provided by any other editor or publisher in the land ? " a million families , the representative people who read the leading dailies in all parts of the country . " // He added : " The test of a writer 's market value is , how many people will read him ? I could give a new writer that test at once . The magazine and syndicate combined were the machinery I offered to get the young men in whom I believed to the people . " 22 three And not only young men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndicate and magazine than Ida Tarbell , the first of the fact writers lured onto the magazine 's staff . She once remarked that " nearly all women who escape marriage and the schoolroom try for journalism , " and in following this course herself she eventually became through her association with McClure 's one of the most prominent writers of her day.23 Well before that , in an article in 1887 called " Women in Journalism , " she had noted an observation of Thomas Wentworth Higginson that women writers were well represented in popular fiction but seldom devoted themselves to serious magazine nonfiction ? a situation she singlehandedly corrected . After a try at teaching Tarbell took an editorial position on the Chautauquan , publishing there her first articles and learning the ropes of the magazine business . A series of small studies of the women of the French Revolution published in the magazine got her thinking about a life of Madame Roland ; what followed was a daring decision to leave her job and move to Paris , supporting herself as a freelance writer for newspapers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she read but could not speak French , and friends tried to dissuade her . Nonetheless , as she recalled in her autobiography , she " plunged gaily into planning for a career in journalism , self-directed , free-lance journalism . Surely I could find subjects enough in Paris to write about , subjects that would interest American newspapers . " What she in fact planned was a " syndicate of my own , " with her newspaper work eventually leading to magazine pieces.24 Beyond this was the study and research needed for a major work on Madame Roland . With three friends she settled in Paris in 1891 and immersed herself in the daily life of the city as material for her one-writer syndicate . She had offered her work to six big-city papers and three began accepting ; several weeks after her arrival in Paris she had her first check for a syndicate article ? $5.25 A few weeks later Scribners bought a short story for $too . Fiction had no part inTarbell 's plan as a writer but the sale holstered her confidence as well as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClure syndicate gained another sale , this for $1o , and an expression of interest in more of her work . Tarbell followed up with articles that included translated pieces cribbed from French newspapers , and some were accepted ? " enough , " she later wrote , " to make me feel that this might be a stable and prosperous market for short and timely articles . " 26 Eventually the McClure syndicate began suggesting articles to her , including a series on French women writers that tied in with her historical interest in Madame Roland . She also was put to work translating short stork for which she was paid less than a dollar a translation , while her articles brought in $2 to $12 apiece . In effect , she had become the syndicate 's representative in Paris . Success as a freelancer meant hard work , and the diligent Tarbell was usually at her desk by eight in the morning and rarely finished a day before midnight . She did her writing in longhand and made careful final copies ? so careful that John Phillips , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assumed she was a middleaged New England schoolteacher . In the summer of 1892 Sam McClure suddenly materialized at her Paris door , announcing he had ten minutes to spare and staying over two hours . Tarbell was captivated by a youthful-looking figure who was about her own age and brimming over with energy . He held forth about his life , his wife , his syndicate , and finally a magazine he was planning . This was where Tarbell came in . What the new magazine wanted from her were articles on the work of eminent French and English scientists . Tarbell 's articles so pleased McClure and Phillips that when the magazine began publication in 1893 she was offered the editorship of the Youth 's Department at a salary of $2,100 a year , which soon would be raised to $3,000 . McClure also agreed to pay her return passage to America with the agreement that she could stay with her family in Pennsylvania for a few months before joining the magazine . The plan changed when McClure suddenly brought her to New York as a staff writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon Bonaparte . It was the start of her long tenure ( about which more in a subsequent chapter ) as one of McClure 's star authors . four When McClure published his autobiography in 1914 ? ghosted by Willa Caller , one of the magazine 's finds as a writer and a valued staff editor ? he paid close attention to his relationship with Ida Tarbell but sidestepped that // with Stephen Crane . For good reason . While Tarbell 's History of the Standard Oil Company was one the magazine 's great triumphs , the failure to publish Crane 's The Red Badge of Courage was a sad episode best left unrecorded . It was through Hamlin Garland that Crane came to McClure 's attention in early 1894 . An unlikely friendship had developed between Garland and Crane when the young reporter covered a talk Garland had given ; Crane 's Maggie : A Girl of the Streets was just published , under the pseudonym Johnston Smith and at Crane 's expense . Garland sent him to see McClure with a personal note : " If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for Mercy Sake ! do n't keep him standing for an hour , as he did before , out in your pen for culprits . " 27 At that meeting or shortly thereafter McClure had in his hands the manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage . He kept it for months , temporizing , unable to buy for lack of funds . Crane was furious , writing Garland that " McClure was a Beast about the war-novel. " 28 Finally , Crane took the manuscript to McClure 's rival , Bacheller , who recognized it as a " vivid and powerful piece of work " though " indifferent to grammatical rules . " 29 For $90 Bacheller bought a shortened version and serialized it through his newspaper syndicate . Bacheller was a reporter for the Brooklyn Daily Times when he began a syndicate operation in 1884 by selling a novel by the British writer Joseph Hatton to Robert Bonner 's Ledger for $3,500 and receiving $500 from Hatton for his service.30 He followed up by placing a series of Hatton interviews with eminent British men and women in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reporting job , opened an office , took on a partner , James W. Johnson , who added capital to the operation , and devoted himself to the syndicate , crisscrossing the country over the a weekly supply of copy equal in quantity and quality to a single issue of Century ; eventually it would claim to supply copy to virtually all the leading American papers . After buying out Johnson and then in 1898 leaving the syndicate business himself under press of competition from McClure and other operators , Bacheller returned to newspaper work as Sunday editor of the New York World . In 1900 he published an immensely popular novel of farm life in upstate New York , Eben Holden , that a quarter century after its appearance was still selling some 3,000 copies a year.31 In 1917 and 1919 Bacheller novels again reached the best-seller lists . Bacheller prided himself on boosting the pay of authors through buying their work for syndication . He remembered that Conan Doyle had been getWRITING // ting about $68 per thousand words when Bacheller purchased his work at a rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bacheller got the Red Badge into print , albeit in an abridged form of some fifteen thousand words , and notice of it followed . The editor of the Philadelphia Press told Bacheller that editors , reporters , and even pressmen on the paper hau ' i the story and were eager to see Crane . Bacheller promptly delivered him for a meeting , and when he arrived " word flew from cellar to roof that the great Stephen Crane was in the office . Editors , reporters , compositors , proof-readers crowded around him shaking his hand . It was a revelation of the commanding power of genius . " 32 Crane 's story had appeared in the Press , however , only because its stock of daily installments of fiction was depleted ; moreover , it was a gamble to publish an unknown writer and a story about the Civil War , a subject considered overworked . A contract for a book version of Red Badge was forthcoming from Appleton and Company and for Crane there was journalistic work for syndication . For Bacheller 's syndicate he traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . At a stop at the Nebraska State Journal in Lincoln , hoping to find a check from Bacheller awaiting him , Crane met Willa Cather , then a student at the University of Nebraska who had proofread the syndicated version of Red Badge while working part-time in the journal office . She remembered that he told her about his dual literary life in which he wrote " in the first place the matter that pleased himself , and doing it very slowly ; in the second place , any sort of stuff that would sell . And he remarked that his poor was just as bad as it could possibly be . " Cather added that in later years she was always astonished to hear Crane spoken of as " the reporter in fiction " for he lacked a reporter 's ability to soak up surface detail and information and quickly turn it into readable copy . " The detail of a thing , " she quoted him as saying , " has to filter through my blood , and then it comes out like a native product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , Crane 's copy was good enough . " I sent him to Mexico for new color , " he recalled . " He wrote for me a number of vivid sketches of the life he saw there . " 34 Work also came Crane 's way from McClure , his finances on the upswing . Crane sought him out ( " Whenever you have some article or other in mind , let me know at once " ) , 35 and the editor bombarded the writer with suggestions ranging from stories about actual battles of the Civil War to a weekly New York letter for the syndicate . One of Crane 's finest stories , " The Bride Comes to Yellow Sky , " appeared in the magazine and he ground out various New York sketches for the syndicate . From the syndicate // came a circular boasting that " Mr. Crane has been added to the McClure staff , and his writings will be placed before the public exclusively through the newspapers of the Syndicate and McClure 's Magazine . " 36 The situation was not entirely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning out hackwork to meet mounting debts , Crane pleaded with his New York agent , Paul Revere Reynolds , to " get me out of the ardent grasp of the S. S. McClure Co . I owe them for advances about $500 , I think , and they seem to calculate on controlling my entire out-put. " 37 ( Jack London would go through a similar struggle with the company . When A Daughter of the Snows , the novel London had written on retainer , turned out to be a failure , it was sold off to other publishers and McClure 's insisted he pay off his debt with future stories for the magazine . They " held the bread-and-butter lash over me , " London bristled , wanting him to write " petty , smug , complacent bourgeois stories ; wanted me to enter the ranks of clever mediocrity and there to pander to the soft , fat , cowardly bourgeois instincts . " ) 38 Still , McClure 's operation remained an important outlet for Crane 's work , and he supplied it with war reporting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ireland . The work , he acknowledged to Reynolds , was " a big graft to play as long as I am here in Europe , " 39 and he urged the agent to peddle it to McClure among others ( " Hit him hard . Hit him beastly hard " ) .4 ? The agent was told that Crane also meant to hit up McClure for a substantial loan and was sent stories to " use as a boost for a loan , " though only if and when " you see this loan in sight . " 41 Crane 's last novels , The Third Violet and Active Service , were serialized by the syndicate but the loan , like many of his schemes for raising money , never materialized . Writers could , of course , bypass operations like McClure 's and Bacheller 's and syndicate their own work , as Ida Tarbell had done in a minor way during her early writing days in Paris , claiming all proceeds as their own . While he was a student at Columbia University following World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job with a syndicate . He then began writing short stories modeled on O. Henry and syndicated them himself to Sunday papers , getting space rates as high as $zo a story . For most writers , though , self-syndication was easier to conceive than execute . His career heating up , Edgar Rice Burroughs , ever the businessman , was quick to spot the benefits of newspaper syndication . " Tarzan of the Apes " had been serialized in the New York Evening World through an arrangement with the Munsey Company , and with its success Albert Payson Terhune , then on the staff of the Evening World , had written Burroughs about future work for // newspaper serialization after prior magazine publication . Subsequently , Terhune bought New York newspaper rights to the Tarzan sequel for $300 . Burroughs was careful thereafter to sell to his primary publisher , the pulp magazines , only first serial rights and reserve to him . - ; the chance for newspaper sales . At first he handled syndication himself , then found the details overwhelming . He wrote to Terhune for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper serial rights for Cleveland , Cincinnati , Toledo , Akron , Columbus , Des Moines , Oklahoma City , Denver , Memphis , and Los Angeles ; and I have no idea what to ask . I presume that the price would be governed largely by either the population of the city in question or the circulation of the newspaper . Can you help me out ? I shall certainly appreciate it . " 42 The solution , finally , was to turn over syndication of " The Return of Tarzan " and subsequent work to a syndicate operation , Chicago 's International Press Bureau , for a percentage of gross sales , with Burroughs holding for himself all dealings with Terhune and the Evening World . five The Newspaper Enterprise Association ( NEA ) was a syndicate of a different order , operated by a newspaper rather than independent entrepreneurs like McClure and Bacheller and offering writers opportunities that were more strictly journalistic . Started in 1901 in the offices of the Cleveland Press , it serviced the needs of the Scripps-McRae ( later Scripps-Howard ) chain of newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of editorial material from pictures and features to cartoons and editorials , the material sent out daily in the form of printed proofs and mats for stereotyping plates . When Burton Rascoe began writing for NEA in 1921 he thought that with a newspaper title and masthead added the material was so complete it " would make an acceptable adless newspaper ? with no spot news in it which would he stale news two or three days later . " 43 Rascoe had been let go by the Chicago Tribune after eight years and numerous positions , including literary editor and drama critic , when he was hired by NEA as a freelance space-rate writer working out of Chicago . ( A predecessor in the Chicago position was Carl Sandburg , who began with NEA as an Eastern Europe correspondent based in Stockholm . When he was fired in 1919 , he was informed that he and the syndicate were not " hitching well // together . " ) 44 Rascoe had first turned down a staff editorial position at the syndicate 's offices in Cleveland ; the salary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believed he could easily improve NEA 's usual feature fare . He made a specialty of medical and scientific stories , going to the John Crerar Library each day , reading specialized journals , then writing unsigned features and occasional news items based on the articles and mailing them at night to NEA headquarters . His first day at work yielded a story , drawn from the Yale Review , about life expectancy that the NEA displayed for member papers with a front-page streamer headline . Rascoe varied his method by taking ideas from obscure journals and calling up specialists around the country and asking for comment . He also regularly contributed to the five editorials the service sent out daily , all of them , he recalled , " innocuous and platitudinous but irrefutable and readable ? homilies on the seasons , the first groundhog , the first robin , the anniversary of some historical event , the pleasures of walking , famous fallacies , the future of aviation . " 45 His efforts brought in $314 his first week , $z68 his second , then settled in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his needs and more than a staff position would have paid . Rascoe had been promoted from one of NEA 's writers to manager of its Chicago bureau , a shift he regretted because it limited his writing time , when he moved to New York as associate editor of McCall 's . The money was less than he was making with NEA but the lure of New York was too strong to resist . Shortly thereafter he became the literary editor and chief book reviewer of the New York Tribune , a position from which he exerted considerable influence on the literary life of the 1920s . Later in the decade he reentered syndicate work with the Editors Features Service , writing a daily column about New York life . Rascoe 's chief competition came from O. O. McIntyre , whose " New York Day by Day " column was circulated by the McNaught Syndicate from 1922 to 1938 . McIntyre 's special angle was to view the big city through small-town eyes , portraying its racy glamor but comforting his readers with the knowledge that they were living elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever leaving a luxurious hotel apartment , that he often lifted material from other writers without credit ( McIntyre responding that he thought anything printed in yesterday 's newspaper was in the public domain ) , and that he had only a passing interest in accuracy . The column , nonetheless , was widely popular , and McIntyre at the time of his death was // said to be earning $200,000 a year.46 When Rascoe gave up his competing column after nearly three years he was appearing in over four hundred papers as well as writing a weekly book review that was syndicated in sixty-three papers . six In 1928 , the year the McClure syndicate was sold , John M. Wheeler described in a Saturday Evening Post article his decision to become a syndicate entrepreneur : " Early in life I decided I could make a bigger profit by selling other men 's brains than my own , and so far I do n't think I have ever found myself wrong . " 47 Wheeler was one of the most important of a new breed of operators who appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world wars , their function narrowed more to purveyors of news and feature material than fiction and poetry . He had first entered the business in 1913 when , after the New York Herald turned down his request for a salary increase as a sports writer , he opened a syndicate specializing in articles by sports celebrities that he ghosted himself . Another specialty was the use of literary figures to cover important events . One of his star attractions was Richard Harding Davis . In 1914 Wheeler sent the middleaged writer to Mexico in anticipation of a war directed against the military strongman Victoriano Huerta , paying a fee of $1,000 a week for the first four weeks , $500 for each week thereafter . The Mexican work was so successful ? and Wheeler so enamored of being the employer of a hero of his youth ? that Davis was sent to Europe by the syndicate to cover the outbreak of war . " We met in the Lambs Club in New York , " Wheeler said of his arrangement with Davis , which called for $600 a week plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how much he wished sent to his wife weekly . The rest we were to hold for his return . There was no letter , no contract ? only a nod . We operated on that contract all through the war , and again it was most satisfactory . " 48 Later Wheeler had the same kind of informal contract with Ring Lardner , who for a number of years wrote a weekly humor column for a new operation Wheeler launched called the Bell Syndicate . I n 1930 Wheeler became general manager of the North American Newspaper Alliance ( NANA ) , a syndicate formed by a number of leading American and Canadian newspapers to supply feature material to supplement news report ing. ' l6 gain an advantage in an increasingly competitive market , syndicates // now searched for journalistic coups by securing the services of prominent figures . The McNaught Syndicate signed up Will Rogers and Eleanor Roosevelt for regular work , and Wheeler 's NANA gave General John J. Pershing $275,000 for serial rights to his memoirs . With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in literary circles , Ernest Hemingway . Hemingway had been away from regular journalism since leaving the Toronto Star in 1923 , but he was eager to get to the Spanish war any way he could , and Wheeler was just as eager to have his eye-catching byline for the syndicate . When Wheeler offered a contract calling for $500 for each cabled story and $I , 000 for stories sent by mail up to ' , zoo words , with Hemingway paying his own expenses , the writer immediately accepted . Hemingway sent thirty-one dispatches from Spain during three trips to the country in 1937 ? 38 twenty-eight of which found their way into print.49 The mailed pieces were fully written out while the cables in abbreviated cableese had to be fleshed out by editors back in New York . Frequently the editors fired off instructions on how they wanted the war covered , treating their celebrity journalist as they might any green reporter in the field , and they let it be known that , given the high fees involved , they wanted only one story a week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file . A particularly heated squabble arose when a NANA customer , the New York Times , complained that Hemingway 's dispatches merely duplicated those from its own correspondent in the field , Herbert Matthews . Although his dispatches had flashes of color and some strong battle reporting , Hemingway 's journalism in the Spanish war was generally undistinguished and NANA was not displeased when the contract expired.5 ? In a memoir published in 1961 , Wheeler avoided particulars of his relationship with Hemingway , saying only that he did an " outstanding job " in Spain and that his reporting " worked all right for us and for him , too , I guess , for we have been pretty good friends ever since . " 51 For his part Hemingway thought well enough of his Spanish journalism that he outlined for Wheeler and for Maxwell Perkins , his editor at Scribner 's , a collection of recent work that included the Spanish material . Nothing came of the idea . Hemingway also thought well enough of NANA that with American entry into World War II he applied to Wheeler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continuing star quality of Hemingway 's name , Wheeler tactfully declined . // seven In time newspaper syndicates grew less important as an avenue of public exposure and a source of income for writers ? and with the shrinkage of newspapers through failures and consolidations the syndicates became less important in general . Where they remained a considerable bonanza was for celebrities , columnists , sports figures , and above all for cartoonists . One of Wheeler 's first triumphs when he got into the syndicate business in 1913 was luring away from the Hearst organization H. C. " Bud " Fisher , the creator of the Mutt and Jeff cartoon strip , with an offer of 6o percent of the revenue from his work and a guarantee of $1,000 a week.52 In his Saturday Evening Post article of 1928 Wheeler noted that the top syndicate pay for newspaper cartoon artists " runs as high as $200,000 a year , without including the income from novelties such as toys , books , and so on . " 53 Remunerative as they were for writers , newspaper syndicates were never bonanzas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Playing Field as Material Life is just a game of base ball so win or lose with a smile . ? Ring Lardner one With the first Frank Merriwell stories in Street &; Smith 's Tip Top Weekly in 1896 , Gilbert Patten led the way into another enriching arena for fictioneers ? tales of the sporting life . Given the volume and popularity of the work that followed , the date seems oddly late , and in fact the world of sport had for some time provided independent writers with material , though largely for nonfiction articles appearing in outdoor journals . ' Among the first writers to tap the market was Poe 's and Willis 's contemporary , Henry William Herbert , a versatile Grub Street scribbler who shared Poe 's eagerness for loftier literary standing . Born and raised in aristocratic circumstances in England and given a classical education at Eton and Cambridge , Herbert came to New York in 1831 at age twenty-four , perhaps in flight from gambling debts. , Tall , charming , hottempered , given to a brawling tavern life while keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young sporting crowd , drawing 152 // on a well-honed knowledge of horses , dogs , and hunting . When his funds ran low he took to teaching Greek and Latin at a boys ' school in New York , then followed the example of a fellow teacher who supplemented his income with newspaper and magazine writing and began sending contributions to local papers . All the while he pursued an active outdoor life of hunting and fishing . Eventually Herbert turned his hand to historical fiction in the manner of Sir Walter Scott , but soon discovered that periodical editors , able to fill their columns with reprinted foreign material , were unwilling to pay for his work . His response was to drum up financial backing and start his own magazine in March 1833 , giving it the same name as Willis 's earlier Boston journal , the American Monthly Magazine . A literary venture whose anonymous contributions came largely from Herbert 's own pen , including a serial novel called The Brothers , A Tale of the Fronde , the magazine was intended as a rival to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herbert stayed on as an editor for two years before a falling-out with his then co-editor , Charles Fenno Hoffman , caused him to resign . Poe would credit the magazine under Herbert and Hoffman with one of the few early critical appraisals of Nathaniel Hawthorne 's work. , Herbert came away from his magazine venture a dedicated professional writer with a reputation for versatility and learning . In 1835 Harper and Brothers published The Brothers , though minus the author 's name in the hope that anonymous publication would stir reader curiosity , and Herbert set to work on a second historical novel . Cromwell came out in 1838 , again anonymously , but found most of its success in an edition in England , where it went through several printings . By now Herbert had given up teaching for full-time independent writing , his profession the rest of his life , turning out poems , sketches , and articles as well as historical fiction . Poe , who thought well of Herbert 's poetry and considered including him in the series on the New York literati , also thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exception of Theodore S. Fay . " 4 Much of this hackwork went unsigned , agreeably so in Herbert 's view since he harbored serious literary hopes , especially as a historical novelist , and wanted his name to appear on only his major productions . ' Translations became a central source of income , Herbert putting French novels into cheap English versions for fees that brought him an average of $3,000 to $4,000 a year . Most writers of the time would have lived comfortably on such income , but expensive tastes and the impulsive entertainment of friends kept I led-ten in financial difficulty . In his search for funds he turned // to writing outdoor articles for the American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine , a New York paper that had been founded in Baltimore in 1829 , using the woodsy pen name Frank Forester . Here he drew on expert knowledge of rod and gun in articles of a practical , how-to bent that were flavored with the personality of a comfortable outdoorsman who relished the manly life . With the success of the articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Times , considered the first general sporting journal in the country , and 111 1845 the first collection of Frank Forester articles appeared as The Warwick Woodlands , modestly turned out by a Philadelphia firm in a twenty-five-cent paper edition and with the author 's name given on the title page beneath his pen name . A first edition of three thousand copies sold out within two months , surprising both author and publisher . Other Frank Forester books quickly followed , among them My Shooting Box in 1846 and more authoritative manuals such as Field Sports in the United States and the British Provinces of America ( 1848 ) and Frank Forester 's Fish and Fishing of the United States and British Provinces of North America ( 1849 ) . Realizing he had struck a vein of popular writing , Herbert gave his outdoor work full attention , even making studious woodcuts for his books . Eventually his work would be valued less for its practical sporting advice than for outlining a code of outdoor ethics ? standards of fair play in the taking fish and game ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a genuine sportsman , " an outdoor journal noted in an editorial well after his death , it was enough to mention the name of Frank Forester , the " prince " of sporting writers.5 Herbert was now settled in a remote location ( presently within the boundaries of Newark , New Jersey ) in a cottage called " The Cedars " built with money sent from his father in England . A widower , he lived a solitary country existence of writing , reading , and walking the fields with gun and sketchbook . The path to his house was said to be lined with dog kennels , a chorus of barking announcing visitors . While to neighbors Herbert seemed a curious eccentric , to friends who paid calls he was still a warm host and convivial companion , and to editors he remained a prolific source of material both erudite and perfunctory . Among his regular outlets was Graham 's , where he shared billing ? both as Henry William Herbert and Frank Forester ? with the prominent writers of the time . In a letter to Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would be included in a " quite successful " future issue with such notables as Longfellow , Willis , Ann S. Stephens , Emma C. Embury , and // Herbert.6 Herbert 's pay rate from Graham 's was $5 a page for prose , about the same as Poe 's usual fee of $4 ? $5 but well under top rates running to $I0 and $12 . At one point , eager for " a little ready money , " he offered the magazine a bargain-basement price of $20o cash for twelve tales of some eight pages each. ? While he was mass-producing magazine pieces Herbert kept on with historical fiction that he hoped possessed literary significance , and in The Prometheus and Agamemnon ofAeschylus he published a well-regarded translation from the Greek . But his popular success continued to reside in the guise of Frank Forester . A sporting novel in 1852 , The Quorndon Hounds , was dedicated to George R. Graham , and the following year American Game in Its Seasons came out under the imprint of the new firm of Charles Scribner . The final Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Horse and Horsemanship of the United States and British Provinces of North America in 1857 , revealed how far he had come as a sporting writer from the cheap edition of Warwick Woodlands . The new work was published in two elegantly illustrated volumes and sold at the premium price of $10 a set . Yet for all Herbert 's industry ? some forty books in a career of just over twenty years ? financial stability never followed . Neither did contentment . In 1858 he married a much younger woman who promptly left him ; shortly thereafter he killed himself with a pistol following a seemingly pleasant dinner party with friends . He was fifty-one years old . Left behind was the unpublished manuscript of an ambitious historical book , Herbert 's last full work . The manuscript , which had been turned over as collateral to a Newark money lender , eventually disappeared ? a melancholy final episode in the unusual life of one of the earliest writers for hire . two Zane Grey broke into print with field-and-stream articles , and while his western novels became routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 30S as an outdoorsman whose name was even more prominent than Drank Forester 's a century earlier . Vacillating at the start of his career between a humdrum life as a New York dentist and his longing to be a writer , Grey sold an article to Recreation Magazine in 1902 called " A Day on the I ) clawarc " that was drawn from a fishing trip with his brother . It was his first publication . Soon thereafter Field and Stream took an article called " Camping // Out . " Three years elapsed before he made another sale , but with the outdoors fixed as a magazine speciality Grey took to the woods and streams with even greater enthusiasm , and neglected his dental practice all the more . In time , his novels huge moneymakers , he indulged a love for outdoor adventure that bordered on obsession . He fished and camped in Florida , Nova Scotia , and throughout the West ; there were extended excursions to the Galapagos Islands , the South Seas , New Zealand and Australia ; and he conspicuously accumulated hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became an international expert , holding at one time world records for several deep-sea catches . The Gulf Stream as well as such favored fishing places as Catalina Island , the Florida Keys , and the Rogue River of Oregon became fashionable sporting grounds because of their association with Grey , his exploits with rod and reel duly recounted in magazine pieces for Country Gentleman , Field and Stream , and Sports Afield and in a flow of books with titles beginning Tales of . . . ( Fishes , Lonely Trails , Southern Rivers , Fishing Virgin Seas , etc. ) .8 Apart from providing material for his magazine articles and books , outdoor life served Grey as therapy for recurring lapses into depression linked to the difficulty he found in writing . His spirits soared on his hunting and fishing trips , and he was able to plan stories and write them in interludes between exhausting periods of pursuit . " Florida for ten weeks was , as always , good for my spirit and health , " he noted in a typical diary entry during an outing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Code of the West and several outdoor stories , and fifty pages in another book . " 9 ( Upton Sinclair added the suggestion that Grey used the outdoors as an escape from fame : " He can not go walking without seeing his name on billboards , nor read the papers without seeing pictures of his sturdy heroes rescuing his lovely heroines . He grows tired of them . . . so he goes after big game fish , and having caught all there are in local waters , buys him a yacht and goes crusing to New Zealand . " ) io During the thirties Grey 's major competition as a literary outdoorsman came from Hemingway , especially as he recounted his exploits in Esquire magazine . The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms were behind him and he had just published his nonfiction treatise on Spanish bullfighting , Death in the Afternoon , when Arnold Gingrich came calling in 1933 with an attractive magazine offer . The editor of Apparel Arts magazine in Chicago was starting a new men 's magazine ; he wanted Hemingway as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article ( later doubled to $500 ) , and he had definite ideas about the nature of the contributions . They would deal with hunting and // fishing , forming ? as Gingrich pitched them to Hemingway ? " a sort of sportsman 's notebook . " In structure they would follow the rambling personal-essay manner of the " Pamplona Letter " that Hemingway had published in a Paris literary journal nearly a decade earlier , stringing together a variety of items in a way that would not involve a " formal composition ? a major effort involving gestation and labor pains . The first article in the fall of 1933 , " Marlin off the Morro : A Cuban Letter , " recalled an ordeal two weeks before in which Hemingway had fought a 750-pound marlin for an hour and a half across several miles of ocean before his rod splintered and the fish was lost . Except for a few articles on war and politics and some that dealt with writing , the initial letter set the tone and subject for most of the twenty-five that appeared over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were center stage , and in his self-portrayal he was a virile outdoorsman with expert knowledge of rod and gun whose gypsy life took him from the American West to the Gulf Stream , from Europe to Africa . In Hemingway 's eyes , the letters were eminently practical , the quality , he insisted , that separated them from Grey 's outdoor writing . Hemingway informed Gingrich that while Grey only wanted readers to marvel at his skill , Hemingway gave useful tips that had cost him thousands of dollars to learn . ( When Grey invited him in 1935 to join in a " giant world fishing cruise to make a motion picture , " Hemingway declined , holding in private that Grey was jealous of his fishing skill and wanted to ride on the coat tails of his fame ? " the silliest of surmises , " according to one of Hemingway 's biographers . ) ' ' The Esquire letters served Hemingway well . Gingrich advanced him $3,000 against future articles , the money used as a down payment on a fishing cruiser he greatly desired ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine publication had the added benefit of boosting his public reputation , bringing him the attention of a larger audience than he had yet found through his fiction while also beginning that image-making process through which the author 's persona would finally overshadow the fiction . One critic has maintained that , thanks to the Esquire letters , no major American novelist before Hemingway " ever had so large an audience for such a sustained period , " and " none ever had like opportunity to talk about himself and to expect admiration in return . " . , Hcmingway took pains , nonetheless , to point out to readers that writing liir mass-circulation magazines was not his real work . " Your correspondent , " he noted in " Monologue to the Maestro : A High Seas Letter , " " takes the practise of ' letters , as distinct from the writing of these monthly letters , very seri158 CHAPTER SEVEN ously. " 14 Gingrich , eager to have a literary star in his magazine , made no complaint , telling Hemingway to " go ahead and write anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it 's good journalism I 'll be well satisfied . If it is n't I 'll know it , as a person , but accept it and like it , as an editor ' . " 15 In later years Gingrich credited Hemingway as an important factor in the magazine 's success . Despite a steep newsstand price of fifty cents at a time when the Saturday Evening Post and Collier 's were selling for a nickel , Esquire was an immediate hit , switching quickly from quarterly to monthly publication and within three years selling over a half million copies a month . Gingrich also used Hemingway 's presence in the magazine as a recruiting device that helped bring in work by John Dos Passos , Ring Lardner , and Dashiell Hammett . Even though Hemingway was paid more than the others ? a gentleman 's agreement with Gingrich called for payment at a rate twice that of anyone else ? his stature was such that writers signed on with the magazine regardless . three Outdoor writing was all well and good but the trail Gilbert Patten blazed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle , as professional writers were quick to notice . Among the legion that fell in behind Patten in writing for the young was Zane Grey , with baseball stories becoming yet another arrow in his writing quiver . As a young man in Ohio Grey was a curve-ball pitcher who attracted the attention of college and professional scouts . At the University of Pennsylvania he shifted to the outfield and became known as a star hitter . In his final varsity game he hit a home run in the ninth inning to beat the University of Virginia , the crowd showering him with roses , and newspapers acclaiming him an authentic Frank Merriwell . Later , in his dreary period as a New York dentist , he played on a New Jersey team with ex-college players ( " Doc Gray , " a sportswriter wrote of him , " is famous for making home runs when needed " ) 1C and thought seriously of turning professional , held back only by a stronger desire to become a writer . After he began selling articles to outdoor magazines Grey tried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the American Boy , whose associate editor at the time was Clarence Budington Kelland , later to become one of the Saturday Evening Post 's stalwart fictioneers . The Short-Stop , rejected by the magazine and other juvenile publications before being brought out in // book form in 1909 by A. C. McClurg , was Grey 's first substantial sale , earning him about $zoo beyond a $loo advance . He followed up with baseball stories for the McClure Newspaper Syndicate , later collected in The Redheaded Outfield and Other Baseball Stories , and another juvenile novel , The Young Pitcher , drawn from his own college playing days . Grey 's alter ego in the story , Ken Ward , studying forestry while pitching for Wayne College , already had appeared the year before in the boys ' outdoor-adventure novel The Young Forester and later would be featured in The Young Lion Hunter and Ken Ward in the Jungle . While juvenile fiction was a passing feature of Grey 's work , for Ralph Henry Barbour it was his entire career . Of Patten 's many imitators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his New England contemporary was one of the most successful . Launched with a novel in 1899 called The Half-Back , Barbour for thirty years produced a steady flow of stories of athletic heroism in prep-school settings . Although his schools bore such gilt-edged names as Yardley and Erskine and Ferry Hill , there was no emphasis in his work on social prestige ; his typical hero , as Henry Steele Commager remarked about Barbour 's fictional world , " was always a little democrat : his mother sometimes took in wash to keep him there , or so it seemed . " ? Barbour 's first novel grew out of a story sold to St. Nicholas magazine that was expanded to book form at the suggestion of an editor at Appleton and Company . What followed from the former newspaper reporter and editor were some 135 boys ' books , many of them series titles , as well as a few adult novels and scores of juvenile stories for St. Nicholas and the Youth 's Companion . Barbour 's tales followed the annual round of the athletic seasons ? from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle repeating again and again ? and often centered on themes , beyond a predictable concern with physical prowess , sportsmanship , and teamwork , that emphasized school spirit , as indicated in the title of his second novel , For the Honor of the School , and such later concoctions as The Spirit of the School and The School That Did n't Care . ' 10 fellow writers Barbour 's productions seemed as effortless as they were enriching , supporting homes in Cambridge and Marblehead , Massachusetts , and winters in the South and Southwest . " He lives on the fat of the land , " one remarked . " I is enjoys himself all the year , and for most of the time makes no diort to get down to work . " ' ' Barbour 's success naturally attracted competitors , with William I Icyliger the most accomplished of the sizeable group . Another 16o CHAPTER SEVEN former newspaperman , Heyliger recalled that his first attempt at what he called a " school-athletic " story was handwritten on both sides of sheets of foolscap , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and foolishly dispatched to the Saturday Evening Post . ' His first success came in 1911 with Bartley , Freshman Pitcher , and thereafter he turned out a string of boys ' sports books at a pace of one a year . Compared to Barbour , his stories were more realistic and contained fewer heavy doses of moralizing . " Today 's boy , " Heyliger declared , is " keener , less unsophisticated ... and better educated . He is coming along . He wants a hero matched in possibilities to himself , and not a prodigy or a caricature . He wants a book that will have , within limitations , the forms and depth of the adult novel . He wants characterization , and not merely the names of characters . " 20 The tide of specialized pulp publications in the 19205 and ' 30s was less of a boon to sporting writers than one would imagine . Street &; Smith 's Sport Story was a marketing success , as was Fight Stories , a competitor from Fiction House ; but generally sports fiction proved to have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of schoolboy stories , perhaps the greatest advance came in slick magazines and books in the 19305 and ' 4os from the hand of John R. Tunis . Unlike Barbour and Heyliger , Tunis arrived at juvenile fiction late in his career after many years of surviving as a freelancer in the nonfiction magazine market with work that ranged from articles in Good Hardware and Charm to a weekly sports column in the fledgling New Yorker under Harold Ross . As Tunis later recounted it in an autobiography , A Measure oflndependence , the main theme of his life was the freedom he gained , burdensome yet satisfying , as an independent writer : " Mine is an ordinary American story but a happy one , chiefly because I was able to do what I wanted to do in life , and make a living so doing . Looking back I realize nobody could have lived a fuller life . I was rare among my contemporaries to be permitted freedom of choice . " 22 After graduation from Harvard in 1911 and World War I service , Tunis turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding the mail with articles and soon discovering the rueful truth of I. G. Wodehouse 's remark that " I have always felt that the glamour of rejection slips wears off ; when you have seen one , you have seen them all . " 23 Eventually the humor weekly Life took a sketch and paid him $5.62 , , his first sale as a writer . He kept grinding away , working nights and weekends while supporting himself and his wife with a laboring job , and by the end of the year , 1919 , his writing income stood at all of $19. o9. // To gain a leg-up in his new profession Tunis took a correspondence course he had seen advertised in a writer 's magazine , and in fact he did better in 1920 , making $SI . When he came into a small inheritance , he promptly moved to France as a full-time writer with the idea of creating a miniature self-run syndicate by covering winter sports along the Riviera , mostly tennis and golf , and selling short articles to a half-dozen American newspapers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at space rates ; his income rose to $30 ? $4o a month . He played tennis ? at Harvard he had made the tennis team ? and chanced to meet and play with Suzanne Lenglen , a French champion and a Wimbledon winner . Back in the United States when his money ran out , he sold an article about Lenglen to the Boston Globe for $35 , his best single payday . Another piece about Lenglen was taken by American Lawn Tennis . Tunis also began making small sales to veterans ' magazines , tI /most important being American Legion Weekly , whose young editor had been in charge of Stars and Stripes in Paris during the war . A sale to the Weekly brought a check for $10o and , for a struggling freelancer , a life-giving note : Pursuant to yours of July 26th , we will make the changes necessary in your article , and will use it on the opening pages of the August filth issue . It 's good stuff . Sincerely yours . Harold W. Ross , editor . Success did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ran into a dry spell for acceptances ; when through a chance meeting he was offered an introduction to a New York literary agent , he leaped at the opportunity . Surprisingly , Erd Brandt of the successful agency of Brandt and Brandt took the young writer on as a client more than for any other reason , perhaps , because of a shared interest in tennis ? and Tunis moved to New York to he at the center of the magazine market . Here he learned to become a salesman , calling on magazines and worming his way past receptionists to display his goods to editors . He reduced article ideas to a few sentences typed on small white cards and followed up , if he chanced to spark interest , with a one- or two-page outline . " It was like working for the Fuller Brush Company , " he recalled , " and in many magazine offices I Hurst have been no more welcome . " 24 Because he had written for American Legion Weekly , he had no difficulty in getting inside Harold Ross 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underway . Although Tunis thought Ross knew " less about sport than any male American I ever met , " the // editor had a hazy notion that his fledgling magazine 's sports coverage could be improved.25 For $50 apiece Tunis was hired to write weekly columns up to a thousand words for the back of the magazine , beginning in April 1925 . At the same time he was turning out a monthly article for American Lawn Tennis for $25 , and when his work there caught the eye of the sports editor of the New York Evening Post , Tunis signed on with the newspaper to write three articles a week for $75 . For the first time since his days as a laborer he now had a regular paycheck . By the late twenties Tunis had broken into Collier 's , the Saturday Evening Post , and Harper 's . Frederick Lewis Allen , then an assistant editor at Harper 's , had been at Harvard with Tunis and the two eventually developed a close writer-editor relationship . Tunis thought he gained intellectual depth from Allen while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flair with language . With Tunis 's articles Allen was willing to open Harper 's pages to sports ? a subject , he noted at the time , " which we now consider not quite respectable . " 26 In later years Allen wrote an affectionate account of his association with Tunis : From the outset , John was like no other author of ours . After we had agreed upon a subject he would go away and hammer out a rough draft . Rough is the word ; it came with many an infelicitous sentence and ill chosen adjective or adverb . I would go to work on this with a blue pencil , and send it back with suggestions for rewriting whole passages . In would come a second draft , and this , too , I would manhandle . At last came a third and the product was ready for the printer . I often used to wonder why John 's manuscripts did n't stream letter-perfect from the typewriter as so many other writers ' did , why he had to beat them out this way in draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . The roughest and most imperfect copy had color and clarity . You knew what he meant.27 Tunis switched to fiction in 1930 for his first book , a tennis novel called American Girl that sold out its first edition of 3,500 copies , then disappeared for twenty years until it was reborn as a Hollywood film , the generic title changed to Hard , Fast and Beautiful . Through the Depression he kept writing fiction while banging out a livelihood as a freelancer , earning at least $5,000 a year , and hooking up with the National Broadcasting Company to report , in fifteen-minute spots , events such as the Davis Cup matches and tennis at Wimbledon and Forest Hills . His next novel , about an Iowa boy who goes to Harvard and eventually becomes a track star , was accepted by Alfred Harcourt of Harcourt , Brace as a juvenile novel . As he remembered , the designation left Tunis " shocked , rocked , deflated " : " What on earth was a juvenile ? I stuttered // and sputtered . He Alfred Harcourt paid no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my manuscript under his other arm , he hustled me down the hall to a tiny cubicle where sat an alert , attractive , brown-eyed woman . Introducing her as Mrs. Hamilton , he dropped the book on her desk as though it might explode , and fled . " 28 Over Tunis 's protests that his book was simply a book , Mrs. Hamilton explained that there was a large and ongoing market for juvenile fiction ; moreover , she thought the book might be a candidate for a prize contest inaugurated by the New York Herald Tribune . Still unnerved , Tunis signed a contract , and in 1938 Iron Duke was published , won a n ' , vspaper prize , and over the years sold some sixty thousand copies in hardcover . Though the novel pointed to a fresh direction for Tunis 's work , and he followed it up with more boys ' books , he did not commit himself wholly to juvenile fiction . He kept on with freelancing , though with modest results . There were fewer magazines about , especially those that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter of 1940 he sold an article to the Saturday Evening Post and realized it was for the same amount he had received from the magazine fifteen years earlier . The same was true of his sales to Collier 's . It seemed , too , that the golden era of sports in the thirties was over , and with its passing was the prospect that his writing career for newspapers and magazines was winding down as well . He turned back to Mrs. Hamilton at Harcourt , Brace , wondering if she was interested in a story featuring major-league baseball . She was , produced a modest advance , and Tunis was off to Florida to absorb the atmosphere of the spring-training camps . The result was The Kid from Tomkinsville in 1940 , the story of a sandlot player who survives disappointments to win a position on a fictional Brooklyn Dodgers team . Three other baseball novels followed , all featuring the Dodgers and forming what a present-day critic calls " something of an American epic that helped establish a serious role for sports as a literary source . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport , yet they were written for a teenage audience and with pressing financial rather than literary ends in view . Tunis now eased off as an article writer and for the rest of his career dedicated himself to sports fiction , writing in addition to baseball about track , tennis , football , and basketball , a game he had to learn from the ground up . Although his work gave off an authentic , insider feel for the various games , Tunis 's plots often centered on moral issues of democracy , racism , and social awareness . A continuing concern , directly expressed in his magazine pieces , was the amateur spirit in sport besieged by the corrupting values of lame and money . // four Paul Gallico 's career took an opposite tack , starting out in sports writing , then swinging to fiction while largely avoiding sports as a subject.30 He had sold a short story to Blue Book for $90 at age twenty-one , but after graduation from Columbia turned to journalism with a job on the New York Daily News and eventually found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a columnist . In the latter capacity he produced a thousand words every day of the week for thirteen years . Looking back , it seemed useful training for fiction , requiring him to present dramatic material in dramatic fashion . It also was a time of vivid personalities in sports , requiring equally vivid prose to capture them on the page . In an effort to get inside his material Gallico rode a speedboat with Gar Wood , tried to catch the fastballs of Lefty Grove and the football passes of Benny Friedman , played tennis with Helen Wills and golf with Bobby Jones , got in the ring with Jack Dempsey . He persuaded the publisher of the News to let him stage an amateur boxing tournament , thereby inaugurating the Golden Gloves , and promoted sports extravaganzas that included a canoe race around Manhattan Island . " It was a fast , gay , wonderful , and completely thoughtless life , " he remembered . " Winter sports merged into summer sports ; the seasons and the years flowed by . " 31 Gallico was also selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was going into the newspaper but developed at the more leisurely pace of monthly publication , and after he sold several to Vanity Fair he was invited to join the staff as an associate editor under Frank Crowninshield . He wrote and edited sports for the magazine and also tried his hand at short fiction pieces , using several pen names as well as his own , sometimes having three pieces in a single issue . In 1931 he acquired Harold Ober as his agent , and two years later he sold a story to the Saturday Evening Post , his first appearance in the magazine after years of trying and failing . Thereafter he concentrated all his outside writing on fiction , with the slick magazines his main markets . One of his stories at the time , a thinly-fictionalized account of the grim setting of a Max Schmeling training camp in Ohio he had once covered for the newspaper , was rejected by several magazines and bounced back in a special way by H. L. Mencken 's American Mercury . After first returning the story , Mencken wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes skyrocketed , since Mencken was one of his literary heroes and he longed to break into // the Mercury , but after a couple months the story was returned with a note from Mencken : " Dear Gallico : I am not going to publish this story , but if you do n't mind I intend to send for it and read it about once every year . " 32 Gallico considered the note nearly as good as a sale until Esquire finally picked up the story for $loo . In 1936 a story sold to Hollywood for $5,000 and Gallico , at age thirtynine , used the stake to cut his ties with journalism , move to England , and set up as a full-time freelance writer specializing in fiction . For material he only rarely dipped back into his sports bag . The main reason was concern that magazine editors might pigeonhole him as a single-subject writer ; a mixture of material , he reasoned , would lengthen his career . Earlier , he had said as much to George Horace Lorimer . After selling a second story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was summoned to Philadelphia to meet the august editor , who told him the magazine was in need of more short stories about sports and Gallico had the background to write them . To his own astonishment Gallico blurted out , " But , Mr. Lorimer , I do n't want to write sports stories . I want to play Hamlet . " He collected himself enough to explain that he meant he wanted to write stories with various subjects . " Young man , " Lorimer replied , " just you go back to New York and write us some more pieces . You tell us a good story and I do n't care what your background is . Remember that . " Gallico took the editor at his word , and was thereafter , as he recalled , " fired with the ambition to have my name a trade-mark , not on any one type of yarn , but simply of a good story " 33 five Another moneymaking magazine and book market for sports writers was ghostwriting , as John Wheeler found in the days before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was working for the New York I /emld as a baseball writer covering the New York Giants when his sports editor wired him to sign up a top pitcher , Christy Mathewson , to cover the World Series of 1911 for a fee of $500 . Mathewson agreed , and after each game pitcher and writer conferred and Wheeler wrote an article . The following winter the two joined again on a group of " Inside Baseball " articles for the Mc ( ; lure syndicate that sold well and were subsequently put out in book form under Matlhewson 's byline as Pitching in a Pinch , the collaborators splitting the proceeds . ' ' Sales were helped along by a review written by Wheeler in the // Herald in which , as he recalled in a breezy memoir , " I let myself go , and I very much doubt whether any book ever got a more favorable review . " 35 Wheeler believed himself possibly the first newspaperman to ghost write for sports figures . True or not , the practice quickly spread , the identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " with " attributions . The Saturday Evening Post in the 1920S reversed its earlier practice of treating sports only in fiction and began carrying ghostwritten articles by celebrity athletes , with much of the work turned out by Wesley Stout , who would succeed Lorimer as the Post 's editor . ( Stout also ghosted a book-length autobiography of Harold Lloyd , the title page listing the account as " Acted By " Lloyd and " Directed By " Stout . ) Among the magazines big hits were ghosted life stories by the boxers James J. Corbett and Jack Dempsey . After he left the Herald to form his syndicate Wheeler continued ghostwriting articles and books for big-name athletes too busy or illiterate to manage them themselves . For Ty Cobb he wrote a book called Busting ' Em and for Mathewson juvenile novels with titles like Second Base Sloan , Pitcher Pollock , Catcher Craig . During one World Series he ghosted newspaper copy for eight star performers . A variation on the approach was to hire writers with established name appeal to cover major sporting events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wheeler 's syndicate ? for the extraordinary fee , as London recalled , of $1,100 a week plus expenses for two36 ? only to have the race called off by the advent of war in Europe . Another of Wheeler 's big-name catches was Ring Lardner. six Lardner was a seasoned writer out of the spirited world of Chicago sports journalism when he was hired in 1913 , at the age of twenty-eight , to write the Chicago Tribune 's prestigious daily column " In the Wake of the News . " 37 Over the next six years he established himself not only as a sports columnist but a major Midwestern humorist , following the vein of vernacular comedy developed by two earlier Chicago newspapermen , George Ade and Finley Peter Dunne . His leap to a larger national stage began when the Sunday editor of the Tribune offered him $50 for a baseball story to appear in the feature section and Lardner gave him one told through semiliterate letters from a brash rookie pitcher with the Chicago White Sox , Jack Keefe , to his friend Al back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use the story // Lardner , apparently believing he had written something worth pursuing , sent it to Lorimer at the Saturday Evening Post . What happened next is in dispute . Some say the story was promptly returned to Lardner , others that it was accepted at once , still others that a fellow sportswriter , Charles Van Loan , persuaded the magazine to accept it .. It is also claimed that Lorimer bought the story over the protest of his staff , who considered Lardner a fine sports reporter but a poor fiction writer , and that a Post sub-editor wanted to tidy up Lardner 's artfully calculated prose . Years afterward Lardner tried to settle the matter in a letter to Burton Rascoe , who had peddled a particularly fanciful version : " The first busher ' story was never sent back by the Post ; it was accepted promptly by Mr. Lorimer himself . I did n't show it to . . . Charlie Van Loan first ; I sent it to Mr. Lorimer at the Post 's office , not to his residence ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place ; I did n't write any preliminary , special delivery , warning letter to Mr. Lorimer ; no sub-editor ever asked me to correct the spelling and grammar , and I never sent any sub-editor or anyone else a bundle of letters I had received from ball players . Otherwise ? " 39 In any case , " A Busher 's Letters Home " appeared in the magazine on March 7 , 1914 , to reader response so favorable that Lorimer asked Lardner for more of the same . Few writers were ever so sensationally launched by a single piece of work . The George H. Doran Company inquired about book rights ; John Wheeler invited Lardner to write humor pieces for syndication ; Red Book , McClure 's , and Metropolitan magazines solicited new stories . Lardner accepted nearly every offer ? though not , for the time being , Wheeler 's ? and by the end of 1914 he had published nine stories in the Post and one in Red Book . In 1916 six Jack Keefe stories ? all using the epistolary form and setting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballplayers and real teams ? were published as You Know Me Al , and two more collections event ually followed . With these stories Lardner opened up new territory for writers ? sports fiction aimed at an adult audience rather than juveniles , concentrating on professionals rather than schoolboys , and depicting athletes not as paragons of virtue but as flawed adults playing a children 's game for money . Jack Keefe , as the British author Virginia Woolf remarked with astonishing insight in a 1925 article on American fiction , is allowed through Lardner 's sure touch to reveal himself as the " foolish , boastful , innocent athlete " ? just the kind of athlete who would become a commonplace figure in the hands of later writers . In Keck readers also recognized something of themselves and their fractured // language ; he was a figure deeply rooted in popular culture , and through him Lardner was able to bring to life the foibles of a national society . This Woolf saw as well ? and recognized as a form of writing about sports that went far beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincidence that the best of Mr. Lardner 's stories are about games , for one may guess that Mr. Lardner 's interest in games has solved one of the most difficult problems of the American writer ; it has given him a clue , a centre , a meeting place for the divers activities of people whom a vast continent isolates , whom no tradition controls . Games give him what society gives his English brother . Whatever the precise reason , Mr. Lardner at any rate provides something unique in its kind , something indigenous to the soil , which the traveller may carry off as a trophy to prove to the incredulous that he has actually been to America and found it a foreign land.4 ? Years would pass before Lardner was taken up by critics at large as a serious literary man and cultural analyst , but at age thirty he now towered over a talented assembly of Chicago journalists and had national name recognition that allowed him to sell everything he wrote . He kept up the " Wake " column in the Tribune while pursuing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1917 publishing twenty-nine magazine pieces and making roughly $1z,000 . From this rich time came such enduring works as the boxing story " Champion , " harsh and melodramatic ? and , for just those qualities , unlike Lardner 's fiction as a whole ? and the genial baseball story " Alibi Ike " ( with its delicious opening line : " His right name was Frank X. Farrell , and I guess the X stood for " Excuse me " ) . Despite success , Lardner refused to take himself seriously as a fiction writer . He sent out the originals of his stories , retained no copies , and failed to keep the magazines in which the stories appeared.4 ' His public stance as a writer was always self-mocking and whimsical . The preface he wrote for How to Write Short Stories , for example , suggested that young writers made a mistake when they sent out stamped , self-addressed envelopes with their manuscripts . " This is too much of a temptation to the editor . Personally I have found it a good scheme to not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got it sealed up in its envelope and stamped and addressed , I take it to some town where I do n't live and mail it from there . The editor has no idea who wrote the story , so how can he send it back ? He is in a quandary . " By 1919 , his family growing , Lardner had left Chicago daily journalism for New York and the hazards of full-time freelance writing . One stable source of income was a column for John Wheeler 's Bell Syndicate , " Ring Lardner 's // Weekly Letter , " that was modeled on his old column in the Tribune . It had the same thousand-word length and Lardner filled it with the same odds and ends , including scraps of poetry , nonsense rhy Ls , and a good deal about his family and his travels . " More than anything else he did , " a biographer , Jonathan Yardley , maintains , " writing the Weekly Letter ' made Ring a genuinely national figure , a celebrity ' as we now use the term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his magazine work and books and one that cut across all ages.42 By the middle years of the 19205 the column was appearing in some 150 newspapers , bringing Lardner a tidy annual income of $30,000 . Rarely did the column deal with sports . Yardley suggests that Lardner 's deep disenchantment with baseball as result of the Black Sox scandal of 1919 helped cut his emotional ties to professional sports in general , freeing him to write of other things . He continued covering the World Series and kept up friendships with sports journalists , but after 1919 he wrote nothing more about Jack Keefe . Several years passed before he wrote any baseball fiction . He ( lid , however , agree to write continuity for a " You Know Me Al " comic strip the Bell Syndicate began selling in 1922 , a grinding labor he kept up for three years for the money it brought him ? approximately $17,000 annually . ( In the 19305 Zane Grey , his magazine fees temporarily shrunk by the Depression , briefly wrote continuity for a daily syndicated comic strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money from the weekly letter , Lardner 's income from syndication now stood at about $50,000 a year . With money also coming in from magazine stories ? eventually as much as $4,500 each from Cosrnopolitan ? Lardner 's total annual income reached about $100,000 , a remarkable figure for a writer who had only modest financial success with his books.43 With the move to New York Lardner 's fictional world shifted from professional sports to suburban society at cutthroat play on golf courses , tennis ourts , and bridge tables . A carryover from his Chicago days was a passion for writing popular songs for the musical theater . He turned out five musical comedies as well as a play between 1919 and 1928 , with only the play , a money loser , ever getting produced . Sweet success came in 1929 ? 30 when he collaborated with George S. Kaufmann on June Moon , a satire of Tin Pan Alley that had Z73 Broadway performances and a road-company run across the country . Newspaper accounts of his activities now referred to him as Ring W. Lardner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly letter for Wheeler 's syndicate , giving up a // steady income and for the first time cutting his ties to newspaper journalism , 44 and devoted himself primarily to magazine pieces and short stories , telling his friend , Long Island neighbor , and literary booster E. Scott Fitzgerald that " I am going to try to work half as hard and make the same amount of money , a feat which I believe can be done . " 45 He continued covering major sporting events for the Bell Syndicate , and Wheeler had the inspired idea of having him attend national political conventions , which Lardner treated as occasions for yawning humor . In the thirties , as physical ills and money needs overtook him , he returned to baseball with six stories in the Saturday Evening Post for the fee ? elegant by Depression standards ? of $4,000 apiece . Collected in book form in 1933 as Lose with a Smile , the stories recreated Jack Keefe in the milder form of Danny Warner , an outfielder with the Dodgers who corresponds with his girlfriend Jessie back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust into the hard world of big-league baseball , more boastful than productive and in the final story demoted to Jersey City . Danny also fancies himself a singer ( his teammates call him Rudy " on account of Rudy Valet " ) and a song writer . " I do n't see how I can mist , " he writes Jessie about one of his songs , " and maybe it means that I can make more money off writeing songs than plain base ball and you know kid what that means . " 46 What it means is he will be able to marry Jessie , a prospect Danny alternately offers and withdraws over the course of the stories . Following the Danny Warner stories Lardner 's last major writing project was twenty-five columns of radio criticism , for $400 apiece , turned out for the New Yorker in 1932-33 . The surprising shift in subject was the result of illness and hospital stays in which , finding it hard to read or write , he paid attention to radio for the first time . The initial " Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the magazine 's editor in which Lardner , after a passing and melancholy reference to his one-time fame as a sportswriter , outlined in typical fashion his new work : To the Editor : In this Home for Disabled World Series Experts they give you a New Yorker once a week as part of the treatment for insomnia , and in skimming over recent issues I have noticed that the publication always contains reviews of new productions on stage and screen , but hardly ever a mention of dat new davil radio which is largely responsible for the fact that there ai n't more stage and screen productions to review .

His mind had been shaped " in the company of a few dozen illiterates playing a boy 's game , " with the result that " however deeply Ring might cut into it , his cake had exactly the diameter of Frank Chance 's diamond . " Fitzgerald concluded : " So long as he wrote within that enclosure the result was magnificent : within it he heard and recorded the voice of a continent . But when , inevitably , he outgrew his interest in it , what was Ring left with ? " Whatever the merits of the argument , Fitzgerald 's final assessment of Lardner , that he " got less percentage of himself on paper than any other American of the first flight , " has dominated later critical views.48 Lardner has continued to seem an original talent who wrote much but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena of writing about sports he still casts a long shadow . Especially with stories of baseball , the most written-about of team sports , he departed from preoccupation with schoolboy heroes and formulaic moral development to offer adult stories that were hilarious , illuminating , devoid of sentimentality , and technically adept . Before Lardner , an experienced pulp-magazine editor remarked , the hero of a sports story " must ever win out against every obstacle . He is denied the privilege of failure and , in consequence , the greater privilege of growth " ; fashioned in the mold of Gilbert Patten 's Frank and Dick Merriwell , he has to remain the " complete , utter juvenile . " 49 With You Know Me Al and Lose with a Smile Lardner broke the pattern , and though this gained him little or no favor with the vast , conventional-minded audience for talcs of the sporting life at the level of the pulps , it led to the directly literary uses of baseball in fiction by Bernard Malamud , Mark Harris , Robert Coover , and Philip Roth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and David Halberstam .

Bernard De Voto one When McClure 's sought out Hamlin Garland in 1896 to write a life of Ulysses Grant he was placed on monthly salary and given full research expenses . S. S. McClure explained the magazine 's largess on the grounds that ordinary journalists of the time were not used to pursuing subjects in depth , and experts either could not write well enough or had axes to grind . He turned to professional writers and , as he put it , decided " to pay my writers for their study rather than for the amount of copy they turned out ? to put the writer on such a salary as would relieve him of all financial worry and let him master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , if not with the authority of the specialist , at least with such accuracy as could inform the public and meet with the corroboration of experts . " ' While McClure himself flitted from idea to idea , a dynamo of energy , he insisted on fact writing that ? as the pas-172 // sage suggests ? got the facts straight . Ellery Sedgwick recalled that " slipshod work , even in tiny details , he would not tolerate . Strange in so romantic a man , but . . . to him , a fact was a fact to be scrutinized , attested , indubitably fixed . . . . In McClure 's , accuracy was a moral force . " , One strain of the magazine 's fact writing concentrated on the present and developed into science , travel , and political articles and especially into the journalism of exposure ? the celebrated muckraking efforts of the magazine 's trio of talented staff members , Ida Tarbell , Lincoln Steffens , and Ray Stanndard Baker . As Will Irwin remarked about the work of such writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with local journalism . " 3 Another strain , indicated by Garland 's series on Grant , turned back to the past and led to a renewed concern with biography and history . With both strains McClure 's led the way for popular magazines , causing competitors to adjust their nonfiction contents accordingly . History and biography had long been inviting fields for professional writers , though as Howells observed in " The Man of Letters as a Man of Business , " while the work had steady value in the marketplace it did not compare with the sales of fiction . Before the great success of The Sketch Book , Washington Irving 's History of New York ( " a kind of freak " as a work of history , William Charvat noted , " although it is proof of the early vogue of historical writing " ) 4 sold 3,750 copies in its first edition in 1809 and earned Irving the significant sum of $3,00o . When public interest faded after Tales ofa Traveller , his third collection of sketches and light tales , Irving turned to history ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependable earning vehicle . The Life and Voyages of Columbus in 1828 brought him the handsome return of $25,000 and placed him among the first American historians to gain a reputation for his work in Europe.5 Thereafter , Irving sensibly devoted his writing career to pursuing the vein of history and biography . In the days before research libraries and research grants the fields of history and biography required building personal book collections and traveling for interviews and document research ? expensive and time-consuming activities for a writer making his living with words . ( Howells would make the point that usually only rich men were able to afford the luxury of historical writing while anyone could set up shop as a poet or novelist . ) Even though he was able to rely on published documents , the Columbus book cost Irving two years of sustained work . His solution was to turn , with A Chronicle of the Conrest of Granada . in 1829 , to a less demanding form that was a variation on the historical romance ? a " romantic history , " Irving called it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenery of the country and the customs of the time , " history that had " something of the effect of a work of the imagination . " o In the latter half of the nineteenth century a surge of interest in historical writing , stimulated in part by the nation 's centennial , was led by the Century magazine under Richard Watson Gilder . Beginning in 1882 the periodical ran Edward Eggleston 's chronicles of life in the original colonies , an enterprise so successful that it turned Eggleston from a career as a regional novelist into a social historian and eventual president of the American Historical Association . This was followed with a famous series of Civil War papers that began with accounts of John Brown 's raid , then a parade of articles by the aging military participants on the war 's great battles . For Grant 's lead-off accounts of the struggles at Shiloh , Vicksburg , Chattanooga , and the Wilderness , the material later incorporated into his Memoirs , the Century paid $1,000 apiece. ? Running for three years , from 1884 to 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the magazine 's editors . " Grant one day and Beauregard the next ! " Gilder exclaimed to his wife. $ But when the first Grant article arrived at the editorial offices it was met with dismay . The material was drawn largely from the General 's flat official report on Shiloh , and an editor had to be dispatched to inform him that something more personal and engaging was needed . Grant redid the article to the Century 's satisfaction , and in fact took pleasure in doing the remaining pieces . " Why , I am positively enjoying the work , " he told an editor . " I am keeping at it every day and night , and Sundays . " 9 Reader response was overwhelming . A contemporary observer declared that the Civil War articles " created in this country the greatest interest ever felt in any series of articles published in a magazine . The Century 's circulation nearly doubled , reaching the lofty figure for a thirty-five-cent magazine of 250,000 , and the parent company 's profits increased accordingly . As a follow-up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his former secretaries , John Hay and John G. Nicolay , for which it paid the dazzling amount for factual material of $50,000 for serial rights . In abridged form " Abraham Lincoln : A History " ran in the magazine from November 1887 to February 189o . It proved heavy going for many readers and the Century 's circulation dipped during serialization , but Gilder professed to be pleased with the work and the reputation it continued to earn his magazine as a quality publication . In 1890 the Century Company published Hay and Nicolay 's Abraham Lincoln in ten volumes . Although popular magazines tended to ignore the past ( with Harpers Weekly in 1871 offering by way of explanation that loss of " links that still connect us // with the past . . . is one of the inevitable consequences of progress and improvement " ) , ? historical and biographical pieces were commonplace now in stately monthlies like the Century and th /Atlantic . University-trained historians had not yet appeared on the scene , and would not until the end of the nineteenth century . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field was wide open for professional writers . two lames Parton entered biographical writing by way of magazine journalism and eventually became the country 's foremost biographer . After contributing articles to N. P. Willis 's Home Journal , he was hired in 1852 as an editorial assistant and took over much of the responsibility for the magazine . When he began printing contributions from the columnist Fanny Fern , and when Willis learned she was actually his sister , Sara Payson Willis , Parton was ordered to carry nothing more by her . The dispute that followed ended with Parton leaving the magazine.12 Subsequently , a chance meeting with Lowell and Daniel Mason , brothers who ran a publishing house , turned Parton in a new direction , writing a life of Horace Greeley , the still-active editor of the New York Tribune and subject of a recent article in the Home Journal . An advance of $750 freed Parton to live in New York for a year and provided modest travel funds for interviewing . Parton developed his biographical methods as he went along ? methods he late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . ' lb know the subject thoroughly myself ; z. to index fully all knowledge in existence relating to it ; 3. to determine before hand where I will be brief , where expand , and how much space I can afford to each part ; 4. to work slowly and finish as I go ; 5. to avoid eulogy and apology and let the facts have their natural weight ; 6. to hold back nothing which the reader has a right to know.13 For the life of Greeley the rules meant traveling to places where his subject had lived , interviewing friends and relatives , examining letters , and digging through back files of the Tribune . Parton checked all his findings with Greeley , who had agreed to cooperate to this extent with his biographer , and eleven months after he began he had a manuscript ready for the printer . Published in 0114 , // , e Ilk of Horace Greeley was a critical and commercial success . Twentyright thousand copies were sold in the first six months , bringing Parton // $2,000 over and above his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a biographer . The same year Greeley appeared Mason Brothers issued Ruth Hall , Fanny Fern 's satirical novel in which she settled family scores with her brother . Parton has a walk-on part in the story as an editorial assistant , Horace Gates , " a gentlemanly , slender , scholar-like-looking person . " Shortly after the novel appeared , with Fern now writing for Bonner 's Ledger , she and Parton were married . By all accounts the marriage was a tempestuous one due to differences in age ( she was eleven years older ) and temperament . After Sara 's death in 1872 Parton married her daughter by her first husband , an apparently tranquil union " that lasted until his own death in 1891 . For his second biography Parton turned to the life of Aaron Burr and an attempt to portray the shadowed career in a more balanced light . He began by making a list of Burr 's descendants and those who had known him in his lifetime together with sources to be consulted and books read ? the routine he would follow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was produced with surprising speed , The Life and Times ofAaron Burr ( 1858 ) , was as controversial as its subject and the recipient of scathing reviews . Some thought Parton had treated Burr 's misdeeds too lightly , others faulted an inflated journalistic style and a tendency to break the narrative with long quoted passages . Nonetheless , the two-volume work was a considerable success , going through sixteen editions in five years and earning Parton forty cents on each volume sold . His next subject , a life of Andrew Jackson , was his most daunting . Materials were scattered around the country , letters were in private hands and zealously guarded , and there was no published work to guide him through the still recent experience of the Jacksonian era . Despite the demands of the task Parton managed to have the first of three volumes ready for sale by Christmas of 1859 and the remaining two the following year . To finance the Life ofAndrew Jackson and two works that quickly followed , General Butler in New Orleans and the Life and Times of Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stream of varied articles , serious and frivolous . While he was writing for the sprightly Ledger he also was appearing in the solemn North American Review , contributing fortypage historical articles at a $3 page rate . The Review 's editor , Charles Eliot Norton , praised Parton 's dexterity , telling him that " men who can write as you do ? articles alike for the great public and for the critical few ? may he numbered on one hand . " 15 For the Atlantic Parton did a series of reports on AmerFACTS // ican cities , another ? prefiguring the work of the muckraking reporters ? on waste in government , yet another on new inventions such as sewing machines . A whimsical anti-smoking article deluged the magazine and the author with reader letters , causing Parton to immediately write another about drinking . In between he published a sober two-part article on " Our Roman Catholic Brethren . " " I am almost always here , " Parton said about the time he spent in his study , " from 7 A.M. to 2 P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all evening . " In addition to new work he pieced together earlier publications for various pamphlets and book collections , in 1871 alone putting out three such concoctions . And he remained at work as a popular biographer , publishing in installments in the Atlantic , then edited by Howells , a series on Jefferson that appeared in book form in 1874 as the Life of Thomas Jefferson . By such diligence he managed to make ends meet and buy time for research ? but just barely . Looking back on his life , he concluded that " an industrious writer , by the legitimate exercise of his calling ? that is , never writing advertisements or trash for the sake of pay ? can just exist ? no more . By a compromise not dishonorable , though exasperating , he can average during his best years $7000 or $8000 a year . But no man should enter the literary life unless he has a fortune or can live contentedly on $a000 a year . The best way is to make a fortune first , and write afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that allowed Parton to devote himself to biography so much as a tried-and-true form of author patronage , talking for hire on the lecture circuit . During the 187os he put himself into the hands of ' lames Redpath 's speakers bureau in Boston and began lecturing throughout the East and the Midwest . The money that came in , together with magazine work and royalties from his biographies , at last bought the research freedom he needed . In 1875 Parton moved to Newburyport , Massachusetts , and settled into what he viewed as the grand work of his career , a life of Voltaire . It was a major undertaking , and an odd one . Heretofore , he had examined American lives , and one of his main research tools , the personal interview , was not available for a figure dead since 1778 . He was mentioning Voltaire as a subject as early as 1867 and could not be dissuaded by perplexed friends and editors . " Why go to the old World for a topic ( even though it be such as Voltaire ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world affords such sub- Parton invested five years of work in the project . Published in 1881 , the // two-volume Voltaire met a cool reception , Parton credited with a vigorous narrative but attacked for critical failings and errors in translations of Latin and French . The book went through several editions but failed to add the final flourish to his career that Parton had anticipated . In the remaining decade until his death in 1891 he returned to occasional journalism , becoming a contributing editor of the Boston periodical Youth 's Companion for pay of $I , zoo a year and writing for a range of publications from the Forum and American Magazine of History to Bonner 's Ledger . Although he was now honored as the father of American biography , he saw no contradiction in his continuing hack writing for periodicals ? the kind of piecework in which , as he put it , " the most gifted and enlightened journalists must of necessity write to order . " 18 three When McClure 's in the 189os began running historical and biographical articles together with journalistic exposures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day . It was innovative in another way in the choice of the writer who led the way in both areas ? the relatively inexperienced journalist Sam McClure had plucked from Paris for his staff , Ida Tarbell . When McClure 's chose to compete with the Century by running Tarbell 's biographical series on Lincoln , Richard Watson Gilder would sniff from the editorial heights that " they got a girl to write a Life of Lincoln . " i9 Tarbell 's first assignment for McClure 's , a life of Napoleon to accompany a number of illustrations , left her amused that a popular magazine would consider such a subject . McClure remembered that the project " touched her sense of humor by its very improbability " 28 But the lure of the material , together with the possibility of returning to Paris for research , was too much to resist . As it turned out , Tarbell did her work mostly in Washington in the Library of Congress , and within six weeks had the first of seven installments ready for the printers . Lavishly illustrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the new magazine 's circulation a boost while helping Tarbell place her long-cherished work , a life of Madame Roland , with Scribner 's , which eventually published the book in 1896 . McClure 's next enthusiasm was Lincoln , with Tarbell not writing this time but editing . The idea was a series of articles on Lincoln , dead just thirty years , written by several people who // had known him yet had not published their reminiscences , the series edited by Tarbell , who also would fill in gaps in the material . But quickly the plan was altered , Tarbell actually writing the entire series and traveling wherever needed for interviews and research ( " Out with you ? look , see , report , " McClure told her ) 21 while drawing a salary from the magazine of $5,000 a year . The money was attractive but so was the magazine and the association with McClure and John Phillips . The new and struggling magazine , Tarbell remembered , had " something youthful , gay , natural about it which captivated me . Often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips called it a ' Ii ) be youthful , gay , natural with a lift ' ? that was an achievement . " 22 By her own count the life of Lincoln took Tarbell four years and , as Mc ( ; lure remembered , it " told on our circulation as nothing ever had before . " 2:5 Yet ahead for Tarbell was even more attention-grabbing work for the magazine and the centerpiece of her long career , the series of articles that became the History of the Standard Oil Company . Behind the series was an impressive amount of dry , diligent , meticulous investigative reporting . McClure believed it necessary to " invent a new method in magazine journalism " in which reporters took the time to master the " highly specialized activities of modern civilization . " Tarbell 's series on the robber-baron practices of the Standard Oil trust was his great case in point . She had made herself , he noted with pride , " probably the greatest living expert on that subject . " 24 Tarbell had first thought of treating the predatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a novel , then turned to the possibility of a factual report . " Was it possible to treat the story historically , " she asked herself , " to make a documented narrative ? " 25 The research task was intimidating . Her chief source was the voluminous testimony that had come from state and federal investigations of the company ; to this had to be added a vast amount of document search , collateral reading , and personal interviews with those Rockefeller associates willing to talk with her . An enthusiastic research assistant , John Siddall , was engaged to work in Cleveland , the headquarters of the company . To Siddall , Tarbell set out her aims in a letter : " Perhaps I should say that the work we have in mind is a narrative history of the Standard Oil Company . I am to do it , and shall go about it as I would any other piece of historical work in which I had to draw almost entirely from original sources . It is in no sense a piece of economic work , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as picturesque and dramatic as I can make it , of the great monopoly . " 2 , Tarhell : s original outline in October 1901 anticipated three articles coming 18o CHAPTER EIGHT to about twenty-five thousand words , but before the series began appearing the plan was increased to six articles . Once publication was underway in November 1902 , and public reaction registered intense interest in an account that unfolded like a detective story , it was increased again to twelve articles and finally to nineteen . The writing that went into it was as demanding as the research . As with the Napoleon and Lincoln articles , each installment of Tarbell 's work was revised three times under the direction of editors ; the material was also sent to Siddall for comment and inspected by economists hired by the magazine . " She had to fight her equals to say the least there , " a McClure 's editor commented about the rigorous process , " and she did it with Sam McClure and JSP John S. Phillips demanding that they be satisfied and thrilled ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it page by page . " 27 But as the series ground on Tarbell 's energy waned . Some installments came in so late there was no time for Siddall 's review . The magazine series and the book that followed ? published in two volumes in 1904 with sixty-four appendices of documentation ? brought Tarbell great acclaim . Stories about her with accompanying photographs appeared in newspapers and periodicals throughout the country . In the Critic she was applauded for having " beaten upon facts rather than upon a gong , and her History of Standard Oil is to the present time the most remarkable book of its kind ever written in this country . " 28 Tarbell herself was overwhelmed by being thrust into the limelight , and later in life she professed to having felt some disappointment . " I had hoped that the book might be received as a legitimate historical study , " she said in her autobiography , " but to my chagrin I found myself included in a new school , that of the muckrakers. " 29 four With the end of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came a resurgence of interest in history and biography ? indeed , in nonfiction in general , including popularized science , current events , and criticism of the arts , that appealed to the wider interests of an increased number of college-educated readers . Writers who could satisfy such interests still came largely from backgrounds in journalism and literature . " Never before , " John Higham remarked about historical writing in the 19206 and ' 30s , " had so many journalists and free-lance writers possessed the ability and incentive to undertake serious historical research . Their movement into this kind of nonFACTS // fiction reflected the same broadening of intellectual interests . . . that was creating their audience . " 30 By present-day academic lights the " serious historical research " that went into such work seems limited . Freelance historians had to gather their material on the fly while juggling assignments that paid the bills and underwrote their labors . While working on The Stammering Century , a social history of American reformers and utopians published in 1928 , Gilbert Seldes continued as a major player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed articles in the Saturday Evening Post . Looking back on this active time in his career , he characterized himself as " nothing of a scholar . I have n't ever , consciously , written to suggest that I knew much of an intricate subject when I had n't studied it . But I 've been content to be superficial . " 31 Frederick Lewis Allen was another , and more notable , instance of a working journalist who pursued the rewards of historical writing without overburdening himself as a scholar . After a try at teaching composition at Harvard , Allen had turned to a career in magazine editing by first following the advice of Frank Crowninshield , then with Century and later the colorful editor of Vanity Fair , that he begin by establishing himself as a freelance writer.32 Allen had a reputation as the author of humorous pieces when he joined the Atlantic in 1914 as an assistant to Ellery Sedgwick . While his days were now taken up with editing , nights and weekends were kept for his own writing ? the regimen he followed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the Century as managing editor , then back to Harvard as its first publicity director before joining the publishing firm of Harper and Brothers , dividing his time between book work and Harpers magazine . The magazine was then undergoing change , following the lead of the Atlantic in reducing the amount of fiction and verse it carried and giving greater attention to contemporary issues and public affairs . The new direction suited Allen both as an editor and writer . In his busy freelance career he shifted from humor to social and cultural matters in thoughtful but witty magazine pieces such as " The Fetish of the Ph.D. , " " The New Tories , " " These Disillusioned Highbrows , " and " Suburban Nightmare , " the latter about urban encroachment in such leafy suburbs as Allen 's Scarsdale . He also undertook his first lengthy work , a sketch of the life of Paul Revere Reynolds , a . tr dalc neighbor and one of the earliest American literary agents ( as noted in the hollowing chapter ) , written privately for the Reynolds family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen that a period in // American life marked by optimism , prosperity , and a happy hedonism had come to a close , a view he outlined in an article in 1930 called " The End of an Era . " The subject seemed to demand more treatment and he turned to a book , working in evenings and arranging his office schedule to free himself one day a week for writing . Although the sudden death of his wife occurred during the writing of the book , Allen kept to an orderly work schedule and Only Yesterday : An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties was published in 1931 to rousing success . Eventually it sold over a million copies in various editions . Allen downplayed his sudden elevation as an historian , calling himself instead a " retrospective journalist " ; as his subtitle noted , his book was meant as an informal ordering of recent events , culled largely from the newspapers and magazines of the period , not a work of original scholarship . As a historian , however , Allen was ahead of his time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as figures of popular culture , concerns ordinarily bypassed in accounts of the past . It was the freshness of his approach joined to a smooth and breezy writing style that caused the book to soar in the marketplace . The book also stimulated Allen 's freelance career . He was now able to wring a $I , 000 fee from the Ladies ' Home journal for an article about the Depression , far better than Harper 's standard rate of $250 for contributors . Although he himself was doing well in the early thirties , the reasons behind the collapse of the economic system preoccupied him and became the subject for his next book . He undertook a crash reading program at the New York Public Library , then in 1933 began writing , following the same systematic program he used with Only Yesterday , giving himself a ten-month period in which he took off every Wednesday from the magazine , with a corresponding reduction in pay . But The Lords of Creation in 1935 failed to match the success of Only Yesterday , and Allen found some irony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months brought in more money than two years of labor on a book about the economic system . Since Yesterday : The Nineteen-Thirties in America , Allen 's companion volume to his first book , was another best seller , enhancing his reputation as an historian of contemporary events who treated his material with broad and lively strokes . He continued freelance work ? in the Saturday Review of Literature , for example , recounting Horatio Alger 's writing career ? but after 1941 , when he succeeded to the editorship of Harper 's , he devoted himself to the magazine . At the start of the 19505 he picked up his writing career and turned out another book devoted to the recent past , The Big Change : America Transforms Itself , 1900-1950 . Success was once more his , the work a Book-of-the-Month // Club choice and the reviews , despite some carping from the academic community , generally favorable . At his death in 1954 obituaries and articles recounted his long editorial career while saluting a body of historical writing that was still popular . Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Herodotus of the Jazz Age , " an epitaph that seemed appropriate for a retrospective journalist whose accounts of the twenties and thirties would strongly influence scholarly historians.43 five ' The field Allen carved out for himself was recent American history ? the justpassed past , tinged with nostalgia , as recovered largely through journalistic materials . Another aspect of public interest in popular history was the reverse ? panoramic world history that gave a skeleton of order to the great sweep of events . H. G. Wells 's two-volume American edition of the Outline of History , appearing to vast success in 1920 , seemed only to whet an appetite for more of the same . James Harvey Robinson 's The Mind in the Making was published the following year , along with John Arthur Thomson 's Outline of Science and Hendrik Willem Van Loon 's epic account of The Story ofMankind , a nonfiction best seller in 1922 . Van Loon , a dominating figure who spoke several languages , played the violin , and dazzled with his wit and erudition ( a " three-hundred-pound figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 was particularly suited to history and biography of vast dimension . Born in the Netherlands , he had come to the United States at age twenty , graduated from Cornell , took a European doctorate , and returned to Cornell to teach history , developing a reputation as an authority on Dutch history . He left Cornell in 1914 , apparently due to controversy over his wartime views . " No one liked me , " he said of his classroom experience , " except the students . " 35 During the war he covered the fighting in Europe until the Armistice as a correspondent for the Associated Press . His career as a popular historian began when he turned to revising the first volume of a planned twelve-volume history of the world for children , a project thought up during his Cornell days . Sixteen publishing houses turned him down before T. R. Smith of the ccntury Company approved the work , only to be overruled by others in the firm on the dual grounds that it would be too expensive to publish and that Van Loon had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van // Loon to Boni and Liveright 's Horace Liveright , who immediately provided funds for four months while Van Loon completed the manuscript . Ancient Man , the opening volume of what was called a " primer history of the world , " came out in 1920 to good reviews and weak sales . Smith , who in the meantime had joined Boni and Liveright as an editor , and Liveright convinced Van Loon to abandon the multi-volume series and pull the rest of his history into a single book aimed at adults as well as children . Van Loon agreed and The Story of Mankind came out late the following year , simply written and brightly illustrated by Van Loon 's own drawings . An edition of fifty thousand copies was quickly snapped up , and during the decade of the twenties the book went through thirty more editions and found its way into a dozen foreign languages.36 For his next work Van Loon , sights only slightly lowered , took on the Bible . When Burton Rascoe , then an associate editor at McCall 's , learned of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazine . Authorized to pay up to $50,000 , he approached Horace Liveright for Van Loon 's price . " He Liveright said he was Van Loon 's agent , " Rascoe recalled , " and he was setting the price . He said , The price for first serial rights is $30,000 , ' in such an emphatic tone that I knew that if I chose to haggle he would cut it to $20,000 or less ; but . . . I knew the subject would be a sure-fire circulation builder worth more to the company than the price asked , and so I said , Sold , $30,000 ! " ' i7 Published by Boni and Liveright in 1923 , The Story of the Bible failed to match the success of Mankind , and Liveright would think back on Van Loon 's first book , and his firm 's first moneymaker , as a stunt book . " Stunt books like Van Loon 's History , " he explained to another author , " they 're the thing , my boy ! I know perfectly well that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something new , something new . That 's the cry these days . " 38 Van Loon continued to produce big stunt books in his enthusiastic accounts of America , Rembrandt , philosophy , music , painting , sculpture , architecture , and geography . Complaints about oversimplification and a lack of historical precision he shrugged off as " pedagogical persecution , " maintaining about the factual underpinning of his work that if he had believed something for years it was true.39 ( Henry Seidel Canby remembered Van Loon as " rolling a body as big and pink as Walt Whitman 's and banging down every argument that was going against him with his great , if rather inaccurate , erudition . " ) ( ) At his death in 1944 the New York Times estimated his total book sales at over six million copies , while the Saturday Review ofLiterature reported that , befitFACTS // Ling of a man who made no small plans , Van Loon ad left ten separate books in progress , one the opening volume of an autobiography called A Report to Si . , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and biography were , to repeat , difficult nonfiction fields for independent professional writers to tackle , due to the time and money needed for research and travel . When John Phillips of ' the McClure syndicate in 1895 proposed to Stephen Crane a series of sketches of Civil War battlefields , the writer indicated his interest but finally declined because of the excessive work involved . He wrote Phillips : Your project it seems to me would require a great deal of study and a great deal of time . I would be required to give up many of my plans for this winter and this I am reluctant to do . I do nt sic know how you would advise going about it but one of the first things I would want to do , would be to visit the battle-field  --  which I was to describe ? at the time of year when it was fought . The preliminary reading and the subsequent reading , the investigations of all kinds , would take much time . Moreover , if I did not place the only original crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals they would arise and say : " This damned young fool was not there . I was however . And this is how it happened . " I evaded them in the Red Badge because it was essential that I should make my battle a type and name no names but in your case , it would be very different.42 For large-scale research projects writers often turned to teaching or took on editorial chores to support themselves until a time when , if fortune smiled , advances or royalties would underwrite their endeavors . Bernard De Voto , who ( luring the 19405 and ' 5os produced monthly essays as the occupant of the influential Easy Chair column in Harper 's , potboiling stories and serials for the slicks , 43 and a tide of freelance magazine journalism while working on his sweeping narratives of Westward expansion , once complained that behind his historical writing was " an effort whose intensity and cost nobody but me will Ever appreciate and nobody , including me , will ever think justified by the results . " Professional writers needed more immediate results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how a self-described " literary gent " like I ) c Voto chafed under history 's hard discipline and yearned for a different kind of writing : // I loathe research with a cold abhorrence . The routine day by day , month by month boredom of history ? reading , checking , appraising , following up , sifting a ton of revoltingly dull material in order to find that one grain of viciously tiresome relevance either is or is n't there , the heaping up of triviality upon pettiness on top of inertness , the endless and cavernous abyss into which one has to heave a hundred thousand inert , colorless , lifeless , and worthless details , all amassed by the stinking sweat of one 's soul , in order to achieve one single foothold , handhold , page , sentence , idea ? all this , I say , makes my soul writhe . My mind yearns for the comfort of loose ideas , fantasies , things you make up , talking and writing at your ease and to hell with slave labor , the dry rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the writer inventing rather than recovering , employing ? as Crane said about the Red Badge of Courage ? typical rather than actual situations . But if the fiction was historical fiction ? and especially historical fiction in which , disregarding Washington Irving 's casual style of romantic history , realism was meant to be a central feature ? the writer could find himself snared in a different kind of trap . James M. Cain provides a telling example . After World War II , his classic California thrillers The Postman Always Rings Twice , Mildred Pierce , and Serenade behind him and working as a high-paid Hollywood screenwriter , Cain began thinking about a big Civil War novel and corresponded with a Harvard professor about background books to read.45 Involvement with the controversial American Authors ' Authority ( discussed in the following chapter ) , screenwriting , and fresh contemporary fiction intervened , and it was not until 1948 that he picked up the thread of his research . In addition to his reading Cain toured the South to acquaint himself with locations and to visit libraries , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his style of research particularly demanding , " for while the historian need only concern himself with who won the battle , and how , the novelist has to know which road his character took after it was over , what he ate while stumbling along , the local names of all sorts of small things , and what the people were doing with themselves as the action proceeds . " 46 In the back of his mind was an obsession with accuracy he had picked up from H. L. Mencken , a lifelong friend . When Cain was once taken to task in the Baltimore Sun over something he had written , Mencken dismissed the importance since things were quickly forgotten in newspaper work . Book writing was another matter , Mencken warning Cain to " never go up on your lines if it 's a book you 're going to do . It 's on somebody 's shelves forever , and for twenty years somebody 'll be taking it down to show his friends , at your expense .

Z he particular story he had in mind dealt with a neglected episode in the war , the Red River campaign in western Louisiana led by the Union General N. P.

" 48 Cain thought the tale had all the ingredients of a best seller and movie potential as well . But the research was seemingly endless , dragging on through the winter of 1948 and into 1949 as Cain trooped off each day to the Library of Congress . After accumulating thousands of research cards he finally began writing , turning out three drafts , each with a different title , each worse than the other . " I simply could not bring it to life , " he remembered . " It just lay there in pieces and I did not know why . " 49 Work on other projects occupied him but Cain refused to abandon his historical novel ; he kept writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . To pep up the story he now focused on a love affair between a Union officer , Bill Cresap , and the daughter of a Southern businessman , Mignon Fournet , with the latter giving her name to the book 's new title , Mignon . But he was far from finished . There was more research , another trip to the South for local color , more rewrites . Months and years dragged on . " God deliver me from a period book , " Cain wrote to his publisher , Alfred Knopf . " But I know no way to finish them , but to finish them . " 50 Finally , in early 1957 and at age sixty-six , he did , but when Knopf 's response was decidedly negative Cain returned to his desk for more tinkering . He expected a rewrite to go quickly , but three years elapsed before another version of Mignon was ready for the publisher ? only to be rejected again . Understandably , this time Cain did not accept Knopf 's decision and told his agent to circulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewriting , resulting in what Cain called practically a new work , belitre publication at last came in the spring of 1962 , nearly a decade and a half alter he set out on the story . lb Cain 's sharp disappointment Mignon by the standards of historical novels a slim work of 246 pages ? made little money ; nor did it sell to Hollywood . One reason for its lacks of success , according to Cain 's biographer , Roy 1 loupes , is the thin treatment of the Red River campaign ; despite the research rlliort Cain had put into it , the reader picks up little detail or atmosphere of the war . Surely another was reader expectation that linked Cain 's name with hard-edged stories set in contemporary California rather than historical fiction . Although he was puzzled by the failure of what seemed an exciting and // well-grounded story , Cain recognized the book 's fate . " It was just a lotta goddamn research , " ' he lamented , and added : " All that reading and labor and a kind of mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to factual writing about the past ? and the on-the-move methods of investigative reporting could replace dry , sedentary library research , whether for factual or fictional history . Such instant history had a reduced place in mass magazines after the glory period of the muckrakers , yet it was still possible to develop a career that drew on the example of Ida Tarbell and the turn-of-the-century McClure 's journalists . Among the leading practitioners of topical , public-affairs magazine journalism in the post ? World War I period was Kenneth Roberts . A former reporter in Boston , Roberts had joined the intelligence section of the Siberian Expeditionary Force in 1917 when he asked George Horace Lorimer of the Saturday Evening Post if he wanted a report from that remote region . By cable Lorimer dispatched the guarded answer he ordinarily gave to such queries : " Am very much interested in articles on social , political , economic situation . " 52 As a rule the Post refused to commission articles ; an expression of interest was all a writer could expect . Lorimer once explained his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , this way : " Commissioning stories is a bad practice ? bad alike for the author and the magazines ? that America has imported from England . Tying up authors on contract is a worse one that we have developed at home . The first means that a magazine is being edited haphazardly by fifty men , instead of consistently by one . The second usually means another headstone in some publisher 's private graveyard . " 53 Finding encouragement in Lorimer 's response , Roberts pushed ahead , producing a whopping zz , 000-word article that , to his surprise , was promptly accepted for a fee of $1,000 . It was the first of over two hundred pieces he would turn out over the next dozen years for the magazine as a roving correspondent abroad and in America . With each acceptance came warmly worded notes of appreciation from the editor , such as one that praised a careful article on immigration reform , a cherished subject in the Post , 54 while reminding Roberts that he was to replace Sam Blythe , who was retiring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // My Dear Roberts : You struck twelve , and kept right on striking up to one hundred plus in this last story . It illuminated my whole evening and reconciled me to my hard life as a farmer . Check by the treasurer on Tuesday . Do n't forget our plot to send you to Washington for the winter , with perhaps an occasional excursion into the Hinterland . Sincerely yours , Geo . H. Lorimerss As with most important contributors , Lorimer bound Roberts to the magazine by steadily raising his rates . By 1924 he was up to $1,750 an article , bringing him an annual income of over $25,000 . The following year his income surpassed $32,000 . In turn , Roberts directed his work solely to the Post save for a brief fling with Cosmopolitan . When the editor of Cosmopolitan , Ray long , offered a contract for a year 's output of articles at $1,000 each , Roberts resisted tying himself down but sent in a piece about actions of the Japanese army in Siberia that the Post had rejected . Long was enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length and , as Roberts remembered , " proceeded to carve chunks from it in a manner far more whimsical than I had ever before encountered . " 56 When Long rejected a third long piece , Roberts sold it to the Post and therewith returned to Lorimer 's fold . Despite his heady success at it , in time Roberts grew dissatisfied with magazine journalism , feeling he was " making no progress ? except financially . " Lorimer was making editorial changes in his work and not everything he wrote was accepted ; more important , he was eager to try his hand at a long historical novel that drew on the experience of his Maine ancestors during the Revolutionary period . Lorimer 's response to a switch to fiction was cool . " I low long 's that novel of yours going to run ? " he wrote Roberts . " No , do n't tell me ! Anybody who writes 16,000-word articles could n't possibly stop a novel short of 200,000 words , and that 's too long for the Saturday Evening ! ' 0s. " ti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written during a winter in Italy under a contract with Doubleday that called for a $1,000 advance . On his wall he posted a work schedule for himself : " Write a chapter every 4 days : write t 1/3 pages ( 1500 words ) every day for 12o days . " 58 Although his heart sank whenever he glanced at the schedule , he held to a rigorous discipline ( of which more in the next chapter ) and within nine months had a 250,000-word manuscript . The hook sold modestly but Roberts kept on with historical fiction . Loritner asked to see his second novel , The Lively Lady , and agreed to run it in // the Post if Roberts would allow deep editing . " It 's a grand book , " he wired Roberts , " and by cutting some of the opening fifty pages ... we can get a fivepart serial out of it . If this is satisfactory and you are willing to trust our surgeon , confirm . Glad to have you supervise the job if you prefer . " 59 Although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but asked for seven installments rather than five , wanting no more money but more space . " What we print we 'll pay for ! " Lorimer responded . " We just have n't got the space ! Well , I 'll see what we can do . Now do n't bother me about this any more , damn it ! " 60 The novel , reduced to eighty thousand words , finally ran in six installments . Lorimer remained generally unenthusiastic , however , about his prized journalist 's fiction , considering it an experiment on Roberts 's part . When Roberts sent him the manuscript of his third novel , Captain Caution , Lorimer dug in his heels . The novel had gone the rounds of the office , he wrote Roberts , and the verdict was unanimous : " We all think it is good , and in some ways a better story than The Lively Lady , but we do not feel we can run another novel that so closely parallels The Lively Lady for some time to come . We now have on hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an earlier market , or decide not to defer book publication , we shall be glad to re-consider Captain Caution six months from now . " 6I Roberts sent the book off to other slick magazines , and all declined . Discouraged , he returned the manuscript to the Post ( and kept submitting it at six-month intervals until , on a sixth try , Lorimer bought ! ) while asking , and getting , the editor 's okay on four nonfiction articles . His articles , readily accepted by the magazine , continued to underwrite Roberts 's lengthy forays into fiction ( " ... in three weeks of February 1932 I earned more from the Post than I did by putting in a year writing and rewriting Arundel , waiting six months for its publication , and collecting royalties for two years after publication " ) , and although he considered reporting fun he bemoaned the difficulty of imaginative writing . It was similar to the pain of childbirth , but " while there are many rapturous moments during some of the preliminaries to childbirth , there are none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 62 Nonetheless , Roberts now saw himself primarily as a historical novelist even though Lorimer kept him busy with articles . His fourth novel , Rabble in Arms , was rejected as a Post serial , Lorimer returning it with a curt comment on the excessive length of a ten-pound novel . He bought for serialization , however , another weighty work and Roberts 's most celebrated , NorthFACTS // west Passage , after reading only half the manuscript . He chose this as the last Post serial to see through publication in his long reign as editor in chief , a fact Roberts took as a personal tribute . eight I n the post ? World War II period one of Roberts 's most visible successors as a magazine writer of contemporary fact was John Bartlow Martin , his work also largely appearing in the Post though never mixed like Roberts 's with forays into fiction . After graduation from DePauw University and early newspaper training in Indianapolis , Martin shifted to Chicago in 1938 to begin a freelance career by writing mostly for a pair of local true-crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women in Crime . In time he had as many as three or four stories in a single issue of the magazines , some under pseudonyms , some ghosted for the women featured in the latter publication . " For example , " Martin recalled , " a young Polish stickup man shot a man during a robbery ; I persuaded his wife to tell me her life story and wrote it under her name . " The woman received $50 , Martin $150 ? his usual rate for a truecrime article . Beyond a few bare facts of a case , the articles were fleshed out with fictitious dialogue and episodes ? ideal training , Martin came to think , for his later career because it taught him to think of his work as stories more than articles , stories that possessed " narrative pull ? that mysterious invisible farce that pulls the reader onward . " 63 Martin eventually put Chicago pulps behind and moved on and up to arper 's , specializing in serious nonfiction , or what he called " heavy fact . " rederick Lewis Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve-month riod , eight articles ? but advised Martin that the magazine could not pay uugh to support him as a freelancer . He recommended spreading his work tool among the big-circulation slicks , and he helped Martin find an agent represent his work , Harold Ober . For breaking into the slicks Martin 's timwas fortunate . The magazines were still popular and profitable but their Itorial formulas had switched from the emphasis on fiction to greater use of tNmli ( ion .
