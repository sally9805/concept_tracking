Distant supernovae hint that the universe will expand forever and at an ever increasing rate . // For sheer explosive spectacle , few events rival supernovae . These titanic bursts of light pierce the cosmos , blazing so brightly that telescopes halfway across the universe can detect them . Now , two teams of astronomers are using these beacons in a most surprising fashion : as probes of how the expansion of the universe has changed . Their preliminary answers , reported early this year , should delight the existentialists among us . It appears there 's not enough mass in the universe to prevent it from expanding forever into a cold , bleak future - indeed , not even close . Further , evidence is mounting that a " cosmological constant " is at work , accelerating the growth of the universe via a repulsion of space so bizarre that Albert Einstein derided its appearance in his equations as his greatest blunder . This effect may inflate the very fabric of space at an ever increasing rate . Building a case for these claims has led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hubble Space Telescope and powerful telescopes on the ground . The researchers have devised a way to spot a whole passel of supernovae among images of thousands of faint galaxies , an ingenious method that seemed impractical a few years ago . They also have learned how to use supernovae as " standard candles " - brilliant flares that burn and fade with predictable intensities , thus revealing their distances from us in the dark recesses of space . Many questions remain , but astronomers agree that supernovae have become a promising means to gauge our ultimate fate . " Measuring these cosmological parameters ties us to questions that go back thousands of years , " says astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ( LBL ) , leader of the group that pioneered this method . " It 's so rare to get at these numbers with such a straightforward , elegant technique . This is an incredibly exciting project . " Perlmutter talks about his endeavor with supernova-caliber energy , darting across an office that overlooks the Golden Gate Bridge miles to the west . The project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy and modern physics . Its goal - to ascertain the curvature of space  --  recalls Edwin Hubble 's pioneering work in the 1930s . However , the research smacks of particle physics : large collaborations ( more than 20 scientists on each team ) , a reliance on automated analysis , and an approach that discards almost all the collected data to expose hidden events . It 's no accident that many in Perlmutter 's group were trained as physicists - and it helps explain why it took the better part of a decade to prove the concept . But by now , Perlmutter and his competitors - a consortium headed by astronomer Brian Schmidt of the Mt . Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatory in Australia - have done just that . " I 'm deeply impressed , " says cosmologist P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton University . " It 's a great triumph , and Saul deserves a lot of credit for pushing it forward . " Nonetheless , Peebles thinks the rivalry has led to hasty public notices . " I depreciate this announcement that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think we know . And it 's a little embarrassing at this stage to say that we do : ' Perlmutter and Schmidt agree their groups must check many potential errors over the next year or two . " As physicists we know what it means to announce a new particle and then be proven wrong , " Perlmutter says . Adds Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) , a senior member of Schmidt 's team : " These are surprising results . People ought to be skeptical until we 're sure that we 've done everything right .

Photograph Hubble observations of distant supernovae ( images in the bottom row are close-ups of those above ) reveal a universe that will expand forever // Thermonuclear Booms The teams both chase a kind of supernova called a type Ia . Famed Supernova 1987A was a type II - a supergiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bits . A type Ia , on the other hand , is the cataclysmic death of a white dwarf orbiting a bloated companion star . The dwarf , about the diameter of Earth , pulls gas from its companion and builds mass until it reaches 1.4 times the mass of our sun . At precisely that limit , the pressure becomes so intense that the dwarf fuses carbon at its core . That ignition happens ferociously . Within seconds , the star detonates like a planetsized thermonuclear bomb . Such explosions , the brightest in the cosmos , often outshine entire galaxies for a few weeks and occur about twice a millennium in a typical large galaxy . The trick is to spot lots of type Ia supernovae on demand . The clever scheme , honed by Perlmutter 's group and since adopted by both teams , works like this : In the dark skies at the time of the new moon , the astronomers take about 50 deep exposures with the 4-meter telescope at the CerroTololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile . Each field contains thousands of faint galaxies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to four weeks later , they collect new images of the same fields . Odds are that among the more than 100,000 galaxies , at least a dozen supernovae popped during that interval . Finding them requires fancy computer programs - and skilled human eyes . The software sifts through the two sets of images , flagging any blobs of light in the second batch that were n't in the first . Most are blips from cosmic rays or transient objects , such as asteroids . But a precious handful are genuine type Ia supernovae , some so distant that their bursts of light took 5 billion years or more to reach Earth . Identifying possible supernovae from among the specks is arduous . It 's as much art as science , says physicist Gerson Goldhaber , one of Perlmutter 's colleagues at LBL . Peering over his shoulder the morning after a flood of data arrives from Chile , one sees why . Scene after scene of " before " and " after " galaxy images flit by ; Goldhaber dismisses most of them with curt comments such as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably junk . " A promising blob bulging from one galaxy meets with approval : " looks like a pretty classic supernova . " But to an untrained witness , it 's just so many dots on a screen . " I 'm obviously using my judgment here , " Goldhaber says with a smile . Eyes go batty after hours of this , but the rewards are worth it . " It 's neat to go home and tell my sister that we just found another star that blew up before the Earth formed , " says Robert Knop , a postdoctoral researcher at LBL . Indeed , the supernovae rank as the most distant individual stars albeit exploding ones - ever seen by scientists . The researchers next must verify each candidate as a type Ia supernova , rather than a flickering quasar or other object . They do this by obtaining its spectrum , usually at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii . A supernova emits a telltale pattern of light dictated by the silicon , calcium , and other elements it forges . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within an hour and differentiate a type Ia , which contains no hydrogen , from the hydrogen-rich type IIs . The spectrum also reveals each supernova 's redshift - the degree to which the expansion of the universe has stretched the supernova 's light . The farthest one yet observed , by Schmidt 's team , had a redshift of 0.97 . That means the universe is roughly 1.97 times bigger now than it was when the star died ; in other words , the universe was half its current age of 12 to 15 billion years . Finally , the teams measure the light output from each supernova at large telescopes scattered on four continents . The most distant events are targeted by the Hubble Space Telescope , which can follow the gradual dimming of a supernova with exquisite precision . Standard Candles The resulting " light curves " are crucial . One might think all type Ia supernovae act the same because they erupt from the maws of identically sized white dwarfs . However , each one varies somewhat in its brightness and in how quickly it wanes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit each explosion to a common template . " When we apply our correction factors , the supernovae become virtually indistinguishable , " says Alex Filippenko , an astronomer at the University of California , Berkeley , and a member of Schmidt 's team who has contributed to both groups . The teams thus transform events of unimaginable violence into the long-sought standard candles of cosmology - objects of known luminosity that shine across great reaches of space . Peter Garnavich , a postdoctoral researcher at CfA , compares this process to " reading the labels on light bulbs " dangling throughout the universe . For example , imagine a row of 100-watt bulbs hanging within a special room with a dark rubber ceiling and walls . A bulb 10 feet away from you will look 4 times brighter than a similar bulb 20 feet away , 9 times brighter than one 30 feet away , and so on . If the entire room starts stretching ( just as space itself grows ) , the bulbs will recede and seem to get dimmer at a certain rate . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their supernovae with their actual distances - as measured by their " wattages " - to gauge how the entire universe has expanded over time . As of April , Perlmutter 's team had done this for more than 40 supernovae , while Schmidt 's group had 16 . Both teams had at least two dozen more under analysis . But even the conclusions from those few stars raised eyebrows - and landed one member of Schmidt 's team , postdoctoral researcher Adam Riess of UC Berkeley , on national television to explain why we may face a frigid future . The first result concurs with several other studies : the universe is expanding too quickly for gravity to stop it . Indeed , the rate at which type Ia supernovae are flying apart implies that the universe contains only about 30 percent of the critical mass needed to halt its growth . " A universe bound by matter simply does not agree with these data , " Kirshner says . More provocatively , both groups say their most distant supernovae are 10 to 15 percent fainter than expected , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space has recently sped up after stretching more slowly since the stars exploded billions of years ago , thus pushing them farther away from us than one would predict if gravity alone ordained the expansion rate . It 's a weird idea that unsettles just about everyone , for it may mean that some mysterious pressure pervades all of space  --  repelling space from itself with increasing magnitude as the volume of the universe grows . Astrophysicists ca n't explain this phenomenon , but they have a name for it : the cosmological constant , symbolized by the Greek letter lambda . Cosmological Conundrum " I find lambda painful and distasteful , " says cosmologist Rocky Kolb of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory . Kolb is not alone . Twice this century scientists have invoked the cosmological constant to account for features of the universe that did not exist : Einstein , to explain what he thought was a static universe , and Fred Hoyle in the 1950s for his steady-state theory of continual creation of matter . " It 's like a siren of cosmology , " Kolb says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sing . Perhaps our ship is going on the rocks again . " Even so , many theorists are entertaining thoughts of lambda more seriously than ever , not least because of the supernova results . Fermilab cosmologist Michael Turner has advocated lambda for years as a key part of theories that yield a " best fit " to observations of galaxies in the distant universe . New satellite probes of the faint microwave glow that suffuses the cosmos , together with other measures of the universe 's mass content , should make or break the case for lambda next decade , Turner believes . But if it 's real , what is the cosmological constant ? Where does it come from ? The facile answer happens to be true : No one knows . It is not , as many reports have stated , an " antigravity " force , for it has nothing whatsoever to do with matter . Rather , it derives from a suspected physical property of space called the " vacuum energy . " It is as if space itself has some infinitesimally small " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to expand . The more space , the greater the expansion . With time , that effect can overcome the attractive force between matter that tends to slow down the universe . If lambda exists and truly is constant ( which not all cosmologists accept ) , that expansion may accelerate ad infinitum . In the simplest terms , space itself would explode .

Photograph This distant supernova was discovered at Cerro-Tololo ( left two images , before and after the explosion ) and then scrutinized by Hubble ( right ) . Photograph The brightest type Ia supernova in four centuries exploded in 1986 in the nearby galaxy Centaurus A. The supernova appears as a greenish dot ( in the dust lane ) because the red-light image was taken a year later . // Or so the hand-waving goes . " In our present state of ignorance , we have no understanding about why lambda should have any value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California , Santa Cruz . When physicists calculate lambda based on current theories , he observes , they get a number more than 100 orders of magnitude bigger than claimed by the supernova teams . Even for astronomers , that 's a whopping gap . Naturally , the supernova projects face tight scrutiny . " It 's unlikely both teams have made the same giant blunder , " says Filippenko . " Our statistics are very good , but some sneaky effect could mess things up . " For instance , supernovae might explode less vigorously in the early universe , because the ratios of various elements have evolved over time . If ancient supernovae were dimmer on average , their distances would once again make sense ; no lambda would be needed . However , Schmidt 's team has explored nearby supernovae in diverse settings - old stars and young , gaseous regions and gas-free . " Everything we 've checked out so far says that supernovae billions of years ago look very similar to the ones of today , " says Garnavich . The peaks and valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Perlmutter adds - another indication that they have n't changed much as the universe has aged . Kirshner describes another worry : " What is the thing that ruins most astronomical inferences ? " he asks . " I think it 's dust . " If blankets of dust swaddle distant galaxies , Kirshner says , that would make these supernovae appear both dimmer and redder than they really are , like smog dulling the setting sun . But the scientists think any such dusty patches would lead to data possessing far more fluctuations than they see . A more insidious factor is observational bias . Oddly enough , it 's more challenging for the researchers to find lots of nearby supernovae , because fewer close galaxies inhabit any chunk of the sky . Yet such events are vital , for they help calibrate the light curves of the distant ones . Although Schmidt 's group has data for about 50 nearby supernovae , both teams are addressing concerns that those objects might be brighter or somehow different than the rest . " These cross-checks should be done within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know whether we live in a universe that will ever come to an end . " And , he might add , we also may learn whether space itself is doomed to inflate as wildly as the most spectacular supernova .
