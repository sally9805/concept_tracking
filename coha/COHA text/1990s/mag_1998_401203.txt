// American soldiers going into battle in the next century may carry a weapon so advanced it will make today 's assault rifle seem as primitive as the muskets fired at Bunker Hill . Understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the venerable M16 rifle , its fraternal twin the M4 carbine or their trusty sidekick the M203 grenade launcher . It is the enemy who has changed . Military analysts say that in the future there will be fewer Desert Storms and more low-intensity operations , including missions to capture drug kingpins and to rein in regional warlords . Confronting these enemies will draw Army and Marine infantrymen into unwelcome new battlefields . Tomorrow 's wars will be fought in the unmapped streets and alleys of the Third World 's sprawling slums . For several years , arms makers have been competing to design the rifle future soldiers would use . It had to be a weapon capable of winning on urban battlegrounds as well as in more familiar desert , forest and jungle terrain . The Pentagon dubbed its dream rifle the " objective individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an international team ot companies led by Alliant Techsystems of Hopkins , Minn. - looks more like a prop from a Buck Rogers movie than anything you 've seen at a rifle range . The modular , 2-barrel weapon promises to turn foot soldiers into devastating , precision-firing platforms . The OICW can be a dual- or single-barrel weapon . The removable top barrel hurls 20mm high-explosive air-bursting fragmentation rounds over tl heads of hidden targets more than a half-mile away . The lower barrel shoots NATO-standard 5.56mm ammunition . These " kinetic " rounds provide accu rate single-round or suppressive fire bursts at distances up to about 500 yarc A single trigger is linked to both barrels , by way of a laser-guided electronic fire-shot system as sophisticated as what you will find on a modern tank . " OICW will leave no place for the enemy to hide on tomorrow 's battlefield , " says Don L. Sticinski , vice president of Alliant . Having won the $8.5 million competition , the company will now build seven OICWs and about 4700 rounds of test-fire ammunition . These will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint Service Small Arms Program Office , at the Army 's R &D; center in Picatinny Arsenal , N.J. Commanding General Joseph W. Arbuckle has invited POPULAR MECHANICS to have a look as the first operational OICW undergoes tests at Picatinny . Program manager Matthew T. Zimmerman , an OICW enthusiast , introduces .000 us to the infantryman 's new best friend : " Preliminary testing programs conducted at Picatinny during the past several years have proven OICW is very effective and has awesome destructive power . " Zimmerman says that the key to the OICW 's success in urban warfare is its electronic fire-control system , which enables the rifle to determine when its " smart " 20mm ammunition should detonate . Like conventional explosive rounds , these shells will detonate on impact , says Zimmerman . However , they also can be set to explode after passing through a wall or sheetmetal . This capability could be especially useful in Third World shantytowns , where abandoned or pirated cargo containers are popular building materials . Firing Around Corners The most impressive and useful feature of these munitions is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our system , " says Alliant program manager Michael C. Moore . He explains that a laser rangefinder pinpoints the precise distance at which the fragmenting round needs to detonate , killing the enemy even if he is hiding behind trees or walls , or in trenches . The Army Infantry Center in Fort Benning , Ga. , charged with evaluating new technologies and tactics , agrees . The OICW can take out the types of targets that in the past required an M16 equipped with an M203 grenade launcher . The difference is that the OICW can do the job with pinpoint accuracy . This is a critical advantage when enemies hide among civilians-a prime survival tactic in urban warfare . And the OICW 's range of 1000 meters is five times greater than what an M16 equipped with an M203 can achieve . The OICW will shoot 20mm rounds one at a time and 5.56mm rounds in single shots or 2-round bursts . For direct fire , OICW has a video camera and a video-tracker function . A special-purpose computer puts electronic brackets around a moving target and automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , though . " You have to be able to hit the enemy with a laser beam in order to know where it is , " says Alliant 's Moore . " You ca n't get range information if you ca n't laze on the guy or near the guy . That 's a given . There 's no magic in it . " It is n't as easy as it looks . The diameter of the laser beam is intentionally narrow to keep the rangefinding computer from being thrown off by background clutter . As in consumer electronics , less is more when it comes to weight . One drawback of the current weapon system is that add-ons bring the weight of an M16 to just under 20 pounds . Production model OICWs will be about 6 pounds lighter . In the field , light weight alone brings a performance advantage . All things considered , Army officials who have evaluated the OICW believe it will provide nearly five times the firepower an infantryman currently carries into the field . Converting Skeptics Despite the promised advantages and the Infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go toward convincing some skeptics . " I do n't think OICW is going to change the way we conduct warfare , " says Charles Q. Cutshaw , an independent infantry weapons consultant based in Spotsylvania , Va . " It 's not going to make a difference in close-quarters battle less than 75 ft. , because high-explosive ammo is not typically used , " he says . Alliant 's Moore points out that using high-explosive fragmentation rounds at short ranges is something the users decide on . " We can give them something that 's usable at 20 meters or we can make the fuze so it does n't arm till 70 meters , or whatever the safe separation distance is determined to be . That 's a user decision . The weapon is not technology-limited . " Photograph The Perfect Infantry Weapon Photograph OICW was tested in the full range of temperature extremes it 's likely to encounter in combat Photograph Simulations enabled the Army to compare OICW kill-power with the currently fielded M16's. // Most experts inside and outside of the military agree that the OICW is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing electronic and computer capabilities into what is essentially a rifle and grenade launcher , " says Terry J. Gander , infantry weapons editor for Jane 's Information Group in England . " The electronics provide the highexplosive round with accuracy and fuzing capabilities that would have been impossible 10 years ago . " Combat Electronics There are , however , some concerns about the durability of the electronics . Gander 's concern is not so much the functionality of the computer as maintenance and support issues . " What happens when you drop it or when it gets wet ? " he asks . Gander suspects maintenance costs could make the OICW more of a financial burden than anyone suspects . The weapon 's makers agree that these are legitimate concerns , but hardly project killers . Life cycle costs are issues that arise with many of the systems the Marine Corps and the Army already employ . " These concerns are not unique to OICW , " says Alliant 's Moore . Sticker Shock For observers encountering OICW for the first time , there is also the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next several years , the Pentagon plans to make an initial purchase of 45,000 OICWs , to be in the hands of elite light-infantry units by 2006 . The weapons will cost between $10,000 and $12,000 each , plus $25 to $30 for each 20mm air-burst round . Critics point out that this is more than 20 times the price of a barebones M16 assault rifle . But raw numbers can be deceptive . While the basic M16 costs about $500 , the must-have options for urban warfare quickly drive up the price . An M16 equipped with an M203 grenade launcher and thermal weapon sight currently costs about $29,000 . The complete M16 modular weapon system , with a digital laser , compass , thermal weapon sight and laser pointer , costs $35,000 . " We are comfortable with the cost , " says Zimmerman . " The money is worth it . " Technical specs and accounting ledgers do n't tell the whole story . In simulated combat , an OICW prototype showed the weapon 's true potential . When the simulated hits were tallied , the virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OICWs saw only one soldier go down . In real combat , there 's only one figure that counts : The number of good guys left standing after the fog of battle clears . <p>
