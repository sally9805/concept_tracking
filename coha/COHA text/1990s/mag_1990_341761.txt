" What should I do ? " my friend Randy called to ask last week . <P> " About what ? " I asked Randy , who is not someone with a lot of money  --  well , not someone with any money , really  --  and who , though highly talented in other ways , has absolutely no understanding of the financial markets . I once lent him some money  --  to eat , as I understood it  --  and found out later that he used it to buy options on a stock someone had told him about . Needless to say , the options expired worthless . <P> " Well , you know . What should I do about my money ? " He was concerned about the Middle East , concerned about the small stake he 'd finally been able to build at a savings and loan  --  was it still safe ? yes  --  and , as best I could tell , he was mainly concerned that there were some easy ways to profit from the gyrating markets and that he was missing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about exactly the same thing . <P> " What should you do about your money ? Nothing ! You do n't have any money . Just keep it in the bank , safe . " <P> But , oh , could you have made money last month ! The first thing to have done was to sell stocks short  --  any stocks  --  and buy puts , little bets that stocks will go down . ( Selling short means selling shares you do n't own  --  by borrowing them  --  in hopes they 'll be cheaper when you buy them back . ) <P> You could have made a huge return shorting the stodgy Dow Jones average , which fell from 3000 to 2500 between July 17 and Aug. 23 . But that was the least of it . Most stocks dropped much more than that . Boeing was down from 60 1/4 to 42 1/2 . Disney was down from 131 1/4 to 95 1/8 . Golden Nugget , from 37 3/4 to 20 1/4 . <P> In July you could have bought IBM October 100 puts for $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension was at its height a month later . Twenty times your money in a month ! <P> The Thai Fund , which invests in Thailand  --  a country not even remotely within striking distance of Iraq  --  dropped from 24 3/8 to 14 1/2 in three weeks . Days later , when it appeared that Iraq would not defeat the entire world after all , it had bounced to 19 3/8 . Imagine the profits you 'd have made shorting it at 24 and then buying it at 14 . <P> Fear and greed are abroad in the land  --  as usual  --  but in an agitated state . And so we ask : What should we do about our money ? Should we buy stocks or real estate at today 's bargain prices ? Or is this our last best chance to get out of the markets altogether ? <P> There are ( always ) three scenarios .
