Ram Tough Colorado State 's gritty fifth-year seniors stopped Michigan State // If a team has to dig itself out of a 16-0 hole on the road in its season opener , it best be one with 16 fifth-year seniors . " I know a lot of coaches would have come in at halftime and yelled , " Colorado State defensive coordinator Larry Kerr said after the Rams dominated Michigan State in the second half to win 23-16 last Saturday in the Black Coaches Association Classic . " I just looked at my guys and said , ' You 're good . You 're better than this . ' " // Yes , they are . Colorado State 's roster has the depth of a WB sitcom and a dearth of NFL prospects  --  Indianapolis Colts president Bill Polian was on hand in East Lansing , Mich. , on Saturday not to watch any Rams but to scout Spartans  --  but it 's rich in experience . With schools limited to 85 scholarships and the top juniors leaving for the pros , a good number of fifth-year players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick says . Fifth-year senior linebacker Nate Kvamme , who showed up in Fort Collins four years ago weighing 185 pounds , is exactly the kind of in-between kid Lubick has cultivated in developing a team that has won 10 straight games . " It 's not the fastest guys , the strongest guys , that make the best football team , " says the six-foot Kvamme , who 's now all of 215 pounds . // In the first half Michigan State junior tailback Sedrick Irvin rushed for 101 yards on 21 carries . His second-half totals : 19 and 9 , respectively . The Spartans ' offensive struggles looked painfully familiar . Last season Michigan State went from 5-0 to 7-5 once defenses put eight men up front to stop Irvin and dared the Spartans to throw . // The Rams have won three WAC titles in the last four seasons , in no small part because of Kerr 's effective use of a seven-man front . His reputation has grown so much that last winter Spartans coach Nick Saban offered him $120,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan State as defensive coordinator . While on his interview trip , Kerr happily explained the Colorado State defense to Saban and his staff . // Kerr turned the job down to remain with Lubick . Imagine his shock when , two months later , the Rams and the Spartans agreed to play each other . Ken-figured that Saban would add some wrinkles to his offense to take advantage of the Rams ' seven-man scheme , but he says that 's not why he decided to install an eight-man alignment against the Spartans . Kerr can watch tape as well as the next guy . " if they have to pass , we win , " he explained after the game . // Michigan State ultimately did have to pass  --  but could n't Junior Bill Burke , whose lower back is so tender that the Spartans have him on a pitch count ( from warm-up to shower , he is n't allowed to throw more than 100 passes per day ) , and freshman Ryan Van Dyke combined to complete 13 of 25 passes for a scant 97 yards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get that per pass , and you 're sunk . // Colorado State had greater success with its rookie quarterback , fifth-year ( of course ) senior Ryan Eslinger , who had waited four years for a chance to play , the last three behind Moses Moreno , who was All-WAC last season . " I was just fed up , " Eslinger says of the last eight months . " I was so tired of hearing ' Moses this , Moses that . ' Moses is done . He 's gone . " // Eslinger awoke his slumbering teammates in the second quarter when he threw a strike on a left-sideline streak to Dar-ran Hall , who turned it into a 57-yard touchdown . Eslinger finished with 205 yards passing and a very big win . After the game , as Lubick dressed , he considered whether a team without so many fifth-year players could have come back the way his did . " I do n't think so , " he said . " It 's easy to give up and pretend you 're playing . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretend . // Louisiana Tech Edwards 's 405 A Record Haul // Nearly every afternoon this summer , Louisiana Tech senior receiver Troy Edwards and junior quarterback Tim Rattay practiced pass routes together . They sharpened the timing that they began to develop last season , when Rattay led the nation in total offense ( 3,968 yards ) and Edwards in receiving yards ( 1,707 ) . They were learning to anticipate each other 's every move . // But 30 minutes into the Bulldogs ' opener at Nebraska last Saturday , they were n't clicking . Though Edwards had caught nine passes for 97 yards , he had no touchdowns , and Louisiana Tech trailed 35-6 . In the locker room Edwards and Rattay talked about their long summer sessions , and in the second half it was as if the two of them were alone on a field again . In what may hold up as the best individual performance of the season , Edwards finished with an NCAA-record 405 yards on 21 receptions  --  three short of Jerry Rice 's single-game mark for catches  --  and scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 56-27 loss . // " Does it surprise me ? " said Bulldogs coach Gary Crowton afterward . " Absolutely not . You should see these two guys in practice ; the ball never hits the ground . Troy is the type of player who can dominate any game , no matter who we 're playing . " // Against Nebraska , which has seven starters back on a defensive unit that was the fifth best in the nation last season , Louisiana Tech chalked up 590 yards passing , the most ever surrendered by the Cornhuskers . Rattay completed 46 of 68 passes . // Edwards , a 5 ' 10 " , 195-pound Shreveport , La. , native , hopes Saturday 's performance proved he can play in the NFL . He wants to make it as a pro not only for his sake but also for his family 's . He 's the youngest of eight children . His father , Sentell , puts in 12-hour days as a construction foreman , and his mother , Ruthie , works as a cook and caretaker for the handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I sacrifice my body so I can take care of my family , " Troy says . " My parents have worked hard for me , and they deserve to live much better than they are now . Every day I push myself for them . It 's what I thought about all summer and what I think about every time I step on the field . "  --  B.J. Schecter // Extra Points An Inauspicious Beginning // Answer : The Big Ten and 54 . Question : Name two things that had disappointing opening weekends . Not only did Michigan State and Purdue lose  --  the latter 27-17 to USC  --  but one of the conference 's marquee players , Wisconsin tailback Ron Dayne , also sprained an ankle and is likely for the Badgers ' opener .... It looks as if artificial turf is going the way of the run-and-shoot . This season 73 of 112 schools will play on grass fields . A decade ago , 55 of 104 played on turf . Colorado already has announced it will return Folsom Field to grass next year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
