" Mama 's baby , " " Mama 's boy " and " Mama 's girl " are all common phrases used to reflect the love and pride a mother feels toward her child . Such phrases , coupled with a little special treatment and an extra dose of pride , may lead observers to contemplate if mama has a favorite kid . " I have heard parents say they have a favorite kid , " admits Dr. Melinda Contreras-Byrd , director of The Generations Center in Cherry Hill , NJ . " However , what I 've noted if you talk more in depth with them ... ( what they really mean is ) that they have a kid who is easier to relate to , a kid who seems to be more like them . This does n't mean that they like one kid more than the other , but so and so is more considerate ... or is so artistic , and I really love that about her .

However , Contreras-Byrd explains that the use of the phrase " favorite child " has negative connotations and is " not good for kids because they construe it like society . " When parents say " favorite child , " what " they are saying is that there is a kid who may be easier to relate to , not that they prefer that kid . " Photograph Dr. Melinda Contreras-Byrd of The Generations Center in New Jersey agrees that most parents have favorite kids , but what they really mean by " favorite " is that one is easier to relate to .

" I think that 's certainly reasonable and to be expected , " Hanley says about mothers having favorites . " I think it 's simply human nature ; we all have preferences . We are attracted to certain personalities or physical characteristics , and we find others less attractive to us . It holds no difference with children . " It does not mean that you do n't love your children simply because you like ( certain things about one ) . Loving is far more intense .

" By the time you get to the fourth , you may not have a photograph . " Dr. Joyce Hamilton Berry , a clinical psychologist in Washington , D.C. , and Maryland , says the opposite may also happen , and older kids may think younger kids are the favorites . " The older ones will say the younger ones got away with murder , " she elaborates . " The older child trains the parent how to be a parent , and the younger children benefit from that .... Parenting is one of the things we do n't get training in . Through experience we learn that a lot of things do n't make a difference .

" While most mothers do n't deliberately choose a favorite child , some do , contends Contreras-Byrd . " I think there are some parents who play favorites , " she says . " That 's very destructive to some kids . " She says one example would be if the children had different fathers , perhaps the mother 's relationship with one father is better than the relationship with the other father . " But most parents are not like that , " she concludes . " They do n't really choose , but I think that it 's important to look for the good in all of your kids , not just things that come to attention . " All kids , just like grown-ups , have wonderful things about them . Find those things and encourage them . " Make sure when you praise one child , praise the other . " <p>
