Asteroids are becoming serious business . Just last month a House subcommittee recommended a threefold increase in spending on observation of near-Earth objects . And only a year after astronomers triggered a short-lived scare by suggesting that asteroid 1997 XF11 might someday strike Earth , another newly discovered asteroid is causing concern . This one is 1999 AN10 , a kilometer-wide hulk that in 2027 could hurtle past us as little as 20,000 miles away . First spotted in January , the asteroid attracted little attention when Italian astronomers posted preliminary calculations of its orbit on their website . But when these results were repeated on CCnet , a widely read e-mail network , some astronomers were outraged . They felt an unwarranted repeat of last year 's scare would be the astronomical equivalent of crying wolf and could lead to public indifference . But news of 1999 AN10 spurred other astronomers to track the asteroid . They posited that the tug of terrestrial gravity during the 2027 flyby could change the asteroid 's orbit enough to threaten Earth during a 2044 passage . Indeed , say astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's orbit for the next 600 years . Maybe the budget increase will be passed by then . <P>  --  By Leon Jaroff
