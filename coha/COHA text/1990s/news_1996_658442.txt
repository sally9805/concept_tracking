<p> There is a sound in Prague that can be heard all year - in the summer , when the tourists clatter across the cobblestoned streets , and in the winter , when the orange trams rattle along the foggy embankments . It is the sound of construction . <p> Prague , the " Sleeping Beauty " of Europe , which survived untouched by both world wars , had settled into gentle decay through 40 years of Communism . But now , six years after the Velvet Revolution , the chrome-and-glass revolution has arrived . <p> Mirrored office towers and fast-food outlets are sprouting all over the historic center , providing uneasy company to the Baroque palaces and Rococo facades of an earlier age . Foreign real-estate developers , prevented from carrying out their multiplex visions under Western Europe 's strict zoning laws , have rushed East . <p> The result , say local historians and preservationists , is that Prague 's new caretakers - out of greed or naivete - are repeating many mistakes made in the West 40 years ago . These mistakes have led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones by overdevelopment , and inner-city decay . <p> Many cities , especially in neighboring Germany and Austria , have tried to counter these trends in the past decade by bringing back pedestrian zones to town centers and shifting commercial development to industrial parks in outlying areas . But Prague is not pursuing these measures . <p> Prague 's Landmark Preservation Area , which covers the city 's historical core , is recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO . Within its 2,100 acres ( 860 hectares ) - second in size only to Rome in all of Europe - rise the gothic spires of the Old Town , the Art Nouveau facades of the Jewish Quarter , and the ramparts of Hradcany Castle . Beneath the castle stretch the red-tiled roofs of a hundred palaces and medieval taverns . <p> It 's little wonder Prague has been attracting tens of millions of tourists a year . But the city is unique among historical centers in Europe in having no zoning plan to protect this area . <p> Jan Kasl , an architect and former planning adviser on the Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution you could barely even mention the word planning . The word was connected with ' Socialist planning . ' " <p> This trend continued when Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 's Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) came to power . The ODS soon also became the dominant force in city politics , and the party , as Mr. Kasl puts it , " wanted to encourage a liberal capitalist investment policy . " <p> Reluctant to involve themselves in unresolved land claims on the city periphery , and with an eye on the bottom line , city authorities quickly sold off real estate they directly controlled in the historic center . <p> Things got so bad two years ago that President Vaclav Havel and the Prague Board ( Prazske Gremium ) , a citizens ' initiative , wrote a letter to the incoming city administration , asking it to cancel a bulky hotel project on the banks of the Vltava , within sight of the Charles Bridge . President Havel and the board won a temporary reprieve , but a new design competition has been ordered , whose conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kotalik , professor of the history of architecture at Prague 's Academy of Fine Arts , and the head of the Prague Board , says what bothers him most is that " Prague 's City Council has no strategy of how it wants the city to develop . " The city is still working on a vast urban plan , and smaller zoning ordinances for the historic center are not even under consideration . <p> While districts like Holesovice and Smichov , just outside the Landmark Preservation Area , would welcome investment , most construction still goes on within the fragile historical core . <p> Adding to Prague 's woes is the issue of restitution . Many individuals to whom the state returned decaying historical properties behaved like the city authorities and quickly sold off their buildings to real-estate developers . Residential property rents remain largely state regulated , but commercial rents are not . With no financial help from the city , it made little sense for property owners to renovate their restituted buildings or to rent them out to tenants at state rates when a bank would pay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The result is that Prague 1 - the heart of the historical center , encompassing the Old Town Square , Wenceslas Square , and the Castle district of Mala Strana - now has a residential occupancy rate of only 26 percent . The rest is office space and government buildings that empty out as the workday ends . One-third of Prague works within the Landmark Preservation Area , but only 5 percent of Prague lives there . <p> Professor Kotalik has thought up several proposals to reverse the trend , including tax breaks and subsidies to owners of restituted property to enable them to repair their dilapidated houses . Kotalik says businesses that buy property in the center should also be made to set aside a fixed proportion of residential units as compensation to the city . <p> Companies that relocate to other areas of Prague should get tax deferrals , Kotalik adds . But so far , he says , City Hall has shown little interest . <p> Kasl , the former planning adviser who quit public service to run his own architectural firm , says part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we held public hearings to explain our new ideas for the city after the revolution , no one showed up . People have to learn that being a citizen of a democracy means expressing oneself . If you do n't , then you 're not part of the process . " <p> Kasl says whenever civic groups , such as the Prague Board , try to press their point , they are treated as a nuisance . " We 're stuck between the Anglo-Saxon concept of decentralization and the Communist-reinforced Austro-Hungarian tradition of rigid central planning . " <p> At City Hall , council member Zdenek Kovarik is in charge of urban development . He does n't see many problems . Mr. Kovarik espouses a blend of laissez-faire capitalism mixed with Communist distaste for meddling outsiders . The preservationists , says Kovarik , are a " bunch of academics " who " think they should have a voice in every decision . " <p> He says dissenters who stand in the way of modern development are wasting their breath . " Prague , " he says , " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an area should be all Gothic or all Baroque , for example , would be pure idiocy . " <p> As for the depopulation of the historic center , according to Kovarik , it 's an insignificant phenomenon caused by " improvements in real estate . " That is to say , people who used to live in dank apartment houses have happily taken up quarters elsewhere while the buildings have been gutted and turned into office complexes . <p> Jaroslav Hejna is one of those people . He was moved out to the city 's edge when the Czech owner of his apartment building sold the site to an Austrian developer for office space . Mr. Hejna considers himself fortunate . He agreed to move , while a neighbor resisted until his apartment was flooded and he had to give in . <p> Hejna 's rent is now higher , but he is philosophical . " We were all victims of this new wild capitalism , " he muses , but adds , " I 've got nice memories , and you get used to new things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architects . His latest and most controversial project is a pair of conical office towers rising along Prague 's embankment . Commissioned by the Dutch insurance giant Nationale Nederlande , the towers have been criticized by preservationists . <p> Mr. Milunic shrugs , " Yes , the project was once likened to a gold tooth that spoils a smile . " But , he argues , it is up to City Hall to impose restrictions on developers before they acquire a site . " Once a foreign investor has bought a plot of land for a wad of cash , " he says , " the city 's hands are pretty much tied . " <p> Kasl is in his Old Town office , pointing to blueprints thumbtacked to his wall . " Look , " he says , " mistakes have been made and city officials are still learning on the go . But even from a business standpoint , every enterprise has to have a strategic plan . That 's even more true for a city . "
