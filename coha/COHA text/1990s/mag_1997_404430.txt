Vicki and Leo Timmer have been on a tight budget ever since the first of their three children was born eight years ago . Since then Leo , a truck driver and at present the sole family wage-earner , has seen his income fluctuate between $22,000 and $32,000 . However , the Timmers own their house and two cars in Kitchener , Ontario , and have no outstanding loans . How do they do it ? Carefully . The cars are both 11 years old , and the house is small ( two bedrooms ) . They just replaced a 43-year-old stove with a " nearly new " 15-year-old model purchased for $50 . They do n't belong to a gym and they do n't have cable . The Timmers have avoided other debts by cutting up their credit cards . " This keeps us from spending money we do n't have , " says Vicki . " All you really need is one good department-store card , but make sure you pay off the balance in full each month .... I only buy the necessities and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Timmers are doing what credit counsellors advise their clients to do . They 're planning their spending carefully and keeping careful track of both how much money goes in and what goes out . Sonya Mount , a financial counsellor in Owen Sound , Ontario , says that many people underestimate both what it costs their family to live and how much money they are spending on certain items . " We ask people to keep an income and expense record  --  every penny  --  for ten months and then teach them how to use that information , so that they can plan their spending realistically , " she says . Of course , every family 's situation is different , and some people 's " shoestring " is longer than others ' ' , but sooner or later most of us need some budgeting ideas . Here are a few areas to consider . Food , Glorious Food Timmer maintains that you can save money on food without compromising on quality . " It can be done , " she says . " I buy top sirloin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I do n't buy is packaged convenience foods . " Another one of her strategies is to buy in bulk . " It 's an absolute must , " she says . " Apple-cinnamon Cheerios are a big thing around here , but I 'm not going to pay full price . I 'll wait until it 's on for $2.39 and buy lots . " How much is lots ? Her husband once bought 60 boxes of ( various ) cereal in one week ! " Cereal keeps for months if you do n't open it , " he says . " We just stacked it all up on a shelf in the basement . " Beverley Lenio , of Whitby , Ontario , had to cut the weekly grocery bill for her family of three when her family income dropped by almost 50 percent . " Before , we would just go out and buy what we wanted ; sometimes we 'd overbuy some things and end up throwing them out , " she says . " Now I do more cooking from scratch . We plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and buy just what we need for that menu . " Ready to Wear Thornhill , Ontario mom Valerie Ferrier believes in buying ahead . " I bought my infant son two new sets of winter coats and snow pants for $10 a set at an after-Christmas sale in sizes 2x and 3x , " she says . Another one of her strategies is to buy neutral colours . " If you are planning , or have , more than one child , try to buy clothing styles and colours that can be passed on . This is especially handy with snowsuits . " Lenio and her husband buy much of their own clothing ( as well as their children 's ) in consignment stores . " Brand-name items sell for as much as 75 percent off , and children 's clothes , maternity wear and toys are often in excellent condition , " she points our . Buying resale clothing is an uncomfortable idea for some ; many people who would happily accept their nephew 's outgrown OshKoshes would balk at the idea of buying the same item at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , Ontario mom Jackie Windsor struggled with at first . " I did n't want to wear other people 's clothing , " she says . " I wanted my son in the best clothes that I could afford . Now I buy lots of things in second-hand shops and Rachel wears all Kyle 's old stuff , and I do n't give it a second thought . " Pocket Money This is where a great deal of our discretionary spending occurs . We make all kinds of little , almost unconscious , spending decisions each day , like eating lunch in a restaurant vs. brown-bagging it , taking the kids to a movie vs. a hike in the woods ( which might be more fun anyway ) . " Overall , you have to think hard about what is necessary and what is n't , " says Vicki Timmer . " One little example  --  phone services . Things like call waiting are not necessary for most people . " Even when something is necessary , or simply useful , there may be a way to cut down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " big ticket " items , " says Lenio . " For instance , I lent a friend our Exersaucer for her youngest child , while she lent me her side-railing for our toddler 's new bed . " They also trade off services with family , friends or even friends of friends . " We know a mechanic who has fixed our car in exchange for the use of our trailer or a financially equivalent amount of babysitting . " Before they had Rebecca , the Lenios " gave " each other an allowance which could be spent on anything they wanted . " At one point it was almost $100 a week each , can you believe that ? " laughs Lenio . " I used to buy clothes all the time , " she recalls . " Now I get $10 , he gets $20 . " Fun , Fun , Fun The Lenios have found their local family resource centre to be an economical source of fun . " For a nominal yearly membership fee , we have daily access to the centre , which offers arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more activities . They also have a toy library which saves us from buying too many toys and also lets us try out some items we are thinking of buying . " Valerie Ferrier also makes use of local programs . " Where I live , parks and rec offers a great lineup of lessons at a reasonable price . In the summer , we spend a lot of time at an outdoor pool which is free . " A New Attitude A key part of better budgeting has to do with developing a new way of thinking about money . Saving money often means using time . That may lead to tricky decisions , particularly for parents who are employed outside the home . Do you spend your Saturday hanging out laundry and making jam , or do you throw the clothes in the dryer , use store-bought jam and spend the day playing with the kids ? Some days you 're going to choose convenience over elbow grease , and that 's just fine . But , if you 're on a tight budget , you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Or you might find that letting one of your kids help you make the jam can be a good way to spend time together . Zoran Maksimovich , a credit counsellor with a United Way member agency in Winnipeg , puts it like this . " We do n't tell people what they should and should n't spend their money on . Look , if you judge that the quality of your life depends on not cooking then that 's a choice you have to make . However , if you also feel that you have to go to Mexico every year , then learning how to cook from scratch might help save money for the trip . " The basic principle is , what is bought must be paid for ( sooner or later ) and what is saved on one item can be spent on something else . Vicki Timmer figures that the money she does n't spend on cable TV pays for the insurance on her house or one of the cars . If you stopped going to the doughnut shop every day , you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep yourself stocked with premium coffee and have money left over at the end of a year . Some people seem to be naturals at careful spending , but for most it 's a skill that has to be learned . Jackie Windsor believes it 's worth the effort . " I wish I had figured this stuff out ten or 15 years ago , " she says . " If I had known how thrifty I could be , I 'd be a millionaire ... well , I 'd be much better off than I am now .
