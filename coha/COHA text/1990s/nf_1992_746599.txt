This article describes and analyzes the components of a well functioning , comprehensive school district assessment program . Three categories are discussed The testing program , surveys and follow-up studies audits , and revisions . The discussion of student testing focuses on the impact of performance based assessment and statewide testing , as well as traditional standardized achievement tests . Criteria for evaluating the feedback loop are included . Other program assessment methods are presented , along with useful tips for using these data . The article emphasizes the importance of enthusiastic acceptance and eager commitment by the people involved . <p> Despite the persistent present day move toward test-based accountability , a well designed school district assessment program is not composed merely of test results . Rather , it is designed to gather a variety of data which allow school leaders to evaluate continuously the district 's program . In plain language , a district 's assessment program is a feedback loop which enables people in the system to judge more accurately how well the district is doing its job . <p> Under the best circumstances this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embraces most of the global objectives of child rearing . However , it is worth the effort required . Program assessment has proven to be a powerful tool for improving the effectiveness of any system in the school ( Zammuto , 1982 ) . The process of assessing needs , developing goals , designing programs to achieve goals , implementing programs , and evaluating the results comprises the operational core of a rational organization . It serves to help these organizations to adapt changing conditions and to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency . <p> The purpose of this article is to outline and analyze the components of a properly functioning , comprehensive feedback loop . Generally , the feedback loop is composed of three categories : The testing program , surveys and follow-up studies , audits and revisions . The Testing Program <p> The first thing that comes to mind when one mentions a district 's testing program is the traditional publisher-produced standardized achievement test usually administered to every student in school during a special period of time set aside at the end of the school year . These instruments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially useful to teachers and site administrators . School board members and other community interests , however , often apply pressure to school officials for comparative data They want to know how their students ( or their schools and teachers ) stack up with other districts in the state and nation . Standardized tests produce such data quickly and efficiently . <p> The weakness of a district testing program , built around publisher-produced standardized tests , is the tendency for this practice to narrow the taught curriculum . Whether we like it or not , principals and teachers bent on raising scores will acquaint their students with test formats and objectives . Since these typically involve heavy use of multiple-choice test technology , training students to perform well on these instruments is actually inimical to the higher order mental processes requiring reflection and creative solutions . Scores rise , but students learn less of what teachers want them to learn . <p> Feedback in the form of test data is most effective when it is designed around the types of student performance described in the written curriculum . Multiple choice questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , but the old adage applies , " You get what you test . " For example , the ability to identify pictures of science laboratory equipment can be highly correlated to competence in a science laboratory . However , when pressure to score well on the standardized tests causes science teachers to spend valuable classroom time drilling students on identifying laboratory equipment from a series of pictures , the purposes of the district 's program have been subverted . Performance-Based Assessment <p> Questions on assessment tools should be designed in a manner which allows teachers to accomplish the district 's mission by teaching to the test ( Resnick and Resnick , 1989 ) . The simplest type of performance assessment commonly used in the schools is the essay exam . Performance criteria can be applied by trained readers to produce " objective " appraisals of student performance . These scores can be gathered and processed to provide important feedback to teachers and administrators . At the same time , they provide valuable goals for teachers and establish important performance standards for students . These essays are often graded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a tie when necessary . <p> A variation of this approach is the use of portfolios . Readers examine several student class products in a portfolio to arrive at a consensus concerning the student 's performance . These same processes can be used to judge " live " student performance in much the same manner that the ringside judges score a boxing match or diving judges score a dive using multiple criteria . Other Student Test Data <p> A comprehensive testing program also gathers data from outside agencies administering certification or placement tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test , the American College Test , Advanced Placement exams and the International Baccalaureate . These data are not truly reflective of the whole district because the test takers are volunteers . Nevertheless , they provide quantitative information about students which help the task of trend analysis . For example , SAT scores can be analyzed in terms of the number of students who take the test , the number scoring above the national average , the number scoring in the top quartile , etc . Over a period of years these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge the comparative strengths , weaknesses , and growth of various programs . Statewide Testing Programs <p> Statewide student testing programs are usually a prominent part of the district 's feedback loop simply because of the widespread publicity the scores receive each year . Like the publisher-produced standardized achievement tests , they are not usually an accurate reflection of the district 's intended curriculum . Because of the publicity , combined with America 's traditional faith in the ability of tests to reflect educational progress , these programs have given rise to lower level cognition in students across the United States . <p> In many instances , districts have aligned their curricula to state tested objectives typically stated in terms of multiple-choice test technology ( School Research and Service , 1991 ) . Despite the plethora of research and scholarly advice warning of its shortcomings , the nation appears determined to take the statewide testing idea one more step and establish a national testing program . The success of this endeavor will , of course , depend upon who develops it , how it is developed , and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of schools is important at all levels of policy making , but the greatest potential for instructional improvement is at the local level . To be effective , nationwide or statewide test data must be embraced by the local district as an integral part of its feedback loop . Why District Testing Programs Fail <p> In many districts , sophisticated student assessment systems form the foundation of successful system wide feedback loops accepted and supported by the instructional staff , as well as the administrators and policy makers . In other districts , the assessment systems have failed and are looked upon with suspicion by classroom teachers . The reason for this phenomenon is associated with a misunderstood and misused concept of accountability often used interchangeably with blame . Accountability in a school setting too frequently focuses on standardized test scores . Consequently , teachers view standardized testing with anxiety and resentment , because the results threaten to judge incorrectly their efforts . In truth , some school administrators do look at testing as another means of teacher supervision or surveillance , but this tends to minimize the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality management point out ( Gabor , 1991 ) , surveillance is not effective in the long run . Rather , employees must take responsibility for quality . The attitudes and perceptions of teachers about the part they play in decisions concerning district curriculum and testing , as well as their perceptions of relations between themselves and the administration , have profound implications for the success of state and national educational reform ( Glathorn , 1987 ) . <p> The emerging literature on organizational effectiveness suggests that student assessment programs be based at the local level with the full involvement of teachers ( Duke , 1987 ) . A study of the statewide student assessment program in Texas concluded with these powerful recommendations ( Lutz and Middrala , 1987 ) : Eliminate the practice of publicly reporting the ranking of school districts by test scores ; Involve teachers in considering ways to improve tests for all students ; and Use test scores as a means to improve teaching/learning . Surveys and Follow-up Studies <p> A comprehensive school district feedback loop typically employs several other general types of measures to augment student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others involve instruments which purport to measure attitudes and values . In concert with student assessment data these instruments can provide information which will give district staff end leadership a more distinct picture of how well the district 's mission is being accomplished . <p> The most popular technique for evaluating programs and education is the written survey . Since these surveys are usually not expensive to construct or administer they are a cost-effective means of collecting feedback . Guidelines for writing survey questions can be found in any good textbook on research methodology . Student Surveys <p> Surveys of students involved in various school programs often provide valuable feedback . In addition to student perceptions of program , surveys ask for information about student background , aspirations , needs , and other demographic data which can be used in conjunction with other surveys and follow-up studies . Ratings made by students may be reliable if they focus on relatively objective perceptions . Usually the conditions for administration of the surveys can be controlled , and the return should be high . Some school districts routinely survey all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The survey typically is revised annually by principals and program heads and focuses on the most immediate concerns of the staff . Graduate Follow-up Studies <p> More expensive and less reliable is the information obtained through graduate follow-up studies . In addition to lower rates of return , surveys that ask students to give global impressions of school experiences are not highly reliable ( Posavac and Carey , 1989 ) . On the other hand , if steps are taken to control the return rate , responses may be quite reliable and valuable especially when they focus on historical behavior and current data such as training completed , jobs held , wages earned , current problems , and future plans . Parent/Community Surveys <p> Parent and community surveys properly conducted can produce indispensable feedback to district staff . Like the graduate follow-up study , steps must tee taken to account for a low return rate . Survey experts maintain that the responses of those who do not respond would be significantly different from those who do ( Posavac and Carey , 1989 ) . However , the results can tee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , it is wise to focus the questions on objective observations as much as possible . It is also important for the district to establish a system to feed back to the parents and community the results of the survey and the district 's response . That response should also be emphasized as a preface to the next parent/community survey . Teacher/School Climate Surveys <p> Teacher satisfaction surveys and various types of school climate measures are valuable for a number of reasons . Probably the most important , they provide symbolic measures of the district 's values . Creating a good place to work should be a major objective of any school district leadership . Staff satisfaction and school climate surveys help communicate to the staff the values and intentions of the district leadership . In return , the data produced help administrators and teachers create a workplace where teachers can succeed in accomplishing the mission of the district . Audits and Reviews <p> A comprehensive assessment system should formally include the results of outside audits and reviews of school district operations . These include the traditional inspections experienced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accreditation studies and reports , state and intermediate agency quality reviews , and the annual audit of the district 's finances . Like the various surveys and follow-up studies described above , these audits and reviews contain valuable data to further clarify and add perspective to the district 's effectiveness , efficiency , and viability . <p> In addition , districts occasionally contract with accounting firms , management consultants , or intermediate educational agencies to perform management studies . These reviews can be directed by the administration to probe areas of school district operations not readily scrutinized by student assessment programs , surveys , or normal audits and reviews . These include reviews of operations such as personnel , payroll , purchasing , maintenance and operations , risk management , facilities development , and so on . Similarly , the customary student summary reports on drop-outs , migration , retention , and attendance should all be included and analyzed as pelt of the district 's feedback loop . Criteria for Judging the Quality of a Feedback Loop <p> The quality of a district 's feedback loop is determined by how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . When a curriculum auditor from the American Association of School Administrators ' National Curriculum Audit Center examines a school district 's comprehensive assessment program six criteria are used to judge its quality . These are as follows ( English , 1988 ) : The assessment program is keyed to a set of goals and objectives adopted by the school board . Assessment program data is utilized extensively at the building level to engage in program review and modification . Assessment program results demonstrate consistent improvement over a longitudinal time period . Assessment data are used to terminate ineffective educational programs . The comprehensive assessment program produces data which are used as a base to establish needed programs . Assessment program results are publicly reported to the board and the community on a regular basis ( p. 128 ) . <p> District feedback loops which demonstrate these exemplary characteristics are usually the result of staff , parents , and community members working together . Therefore , they feature a variety of feedback sources which together provide a balanced , clear , and objective assessment of district performance . School districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any component of a comprehensive assessment program depends upon enthusiastic acceptance and eager commitment by the people involved . <p> In the final analysis , a school district 's assessment program is as essential to its operations as our own eyes and ears are to us . It provides input necessary to the survival of the school system . The effort required to develop and maintain the feedback loop is eminently worthwhile . <p>
