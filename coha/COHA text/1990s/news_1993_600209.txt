<p> WASHINGTON President Clinton , saying small businesses are starving for the loans they need to prosper and create jobs , announced plans Wednesday to break the grip of a nationwide credit crunch . <p> His idea : ease regulations that discourage banks from lending to small business . " We want bankers to get back into the business of lending money , " Clinton said . <p> Bankers applauded , though some say the plan does n't go far enough . Critics say easing regulations threatens the safety of the banking system , something Clinton emphatically denied . And many economists say the plan wo n't do much good because the real credit problem is n't a shortage of loans but a shortage of borrowers . <p> Clinton 's plan is designed to help entrepreneurs like Maxine Cohen , who owns a small but growing jewelry-making firm in Silver Spring , Md . Cohen 's bank , trying to clean up its risky small-business loan portfolio , recently refused to renew her loan . " I used to feel I had a close relationship with this bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared how I was doing . " Now she 's looking for another lender with little luck . <p> Everyone agrees there 's a problem . Bank lending to businesses has fallen steadily the past three years to a nine-year-low $ 536 billion Dec. 31 from a peak $ 623 billion March 31 , 1990 . <p> Small businesses account for nearly two-thirds of all jobs . If they ca n't get loans or do n't borrow , it means they are n't opening stores , expanding factories , buying equipment or adding workers . Indeed , small businesses have created only 400,000 jobs the past two years after creating 3.2 million in 1989 and 1990 . <p> " These businesses have been hit especially hard by the recession and by a problem not of their own making that can be summarized by two fearsome but now well-worn words : credit crunch , " Clinton said . " Small companies are simply unable in too many cases to get loans from banks . " <p> To change that , the Clinton administration is trying to lighten the regulatory burden on banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The administration 's program will : <p> Encourage healthy banks to make more character loans based on a borrower 's reputation and performance instead of a by-the-numbers analysis of their finances . Under Clinton 's plan , healthy banks could make a limited number of small loans with minimum documentation . Bankers say regulators , burned by the S &L; disaster , now demand that they document everything . " They 're trying to take the risk out of banking , " complains John Shivers Sr. , chairman of Southwest Bank in Fort Worth . " Well , banking is the game of taking on manageable risk . You 're going to lose some . If a bank is n't taking any loan losses , it 's not doing its job . " <p> Eliminate the need for appraisals on some small-business loans . Collateral for small-business loans often includes real estate . Now , appraisals by licensed or certified appraisers are required on the property . But the cost of an appraisal can discourage the borrower from seeking the loan . Suppose a small-business owner wants a $ 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost $ 3,000 , equal to a 3% up-front fee on the loan , says St. Louis banker Bob Hawkins , president of the Independent Bankers Association of America . " It simply should n't be as burdensome to get a $ 25,000 loan as it is to get a $ 25 million loan , " Clinton said . <p> Change the appeals process for banks that believe regulators are too tough or unfair . Bankers now say they run the risk of being punished if they complain about regulatory overkill . Clinton 's plan requires each regulatory agency to set up a " fair and speedy review of examination complaints . " <p> The four federal bank-regulatory agencies have agreed to the outlines of the plan , though details have yet to be worked out . The agencies are the Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Office of Thrift Supervision . The administration expects the plan to be in effect within three months . <p> Bankers have said easing regulation could lead to $ 86 billion in lending . Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plan would create , promising only " a flow of billions of dollars of economic stimulus that does n't cost the American taxpayers one red cent . " <p> Bankers liked much of what they heard . " It would make the system work much better , " the IBAA 's Hawkins says . " It would certainly make the banker 's job easier . " John Medlin , chairman of Winston-Salem , N.C.-based Wachovia , called the plan " a good beginning . " <p> Some bankers say Clinton did n't go far enough . <p> Their biggest gripe is that Clinton left intact a law , passed late in 1991 , that hit the banking industry with a blizzard of regulations , governing everything from how much bankers are paid to whom they can lend to . The hated statute the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . Improvement Act also imposes stiff civil penalties for violations . " The law tells us not to take risks , " says Harris Simmons , CEO of Zions Bancorporation in Salt Lake City . <p> Critics of the banking industry worry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S &L; debacle , in which loosened regulation led to a $ 200 billion taxpayer bailout . " Now is not the time to dwell on the bankers ' self-serving complaints against government regulation , " says Michelle Meier , lobbyist for Consumers Union . " Now is the time to focus on the public 's complaint against deregulation and the huge taxpayer bailout it produced . " <p> Clinton insists the changes he 's making wo n't threaten the safety of the banking system . He pledged regulators will still " go after bad loans and troubled banks . . . . ( The plan ) will not cause a single bank to fail . " <p> Even if it does n't lead to disaster , Clinton 's plan simply might not work . <p> " I do n't think bank regulation is the problem , " says Lacy Hunt , chief economist at HSBC Group in New York . " There is just minimal appetite for loans . " He and others say many businesses are n't borrowing because they 're still worried about the economy . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents small businesses , rebuts the notion of a credit crunch . The study found that loans are hard to get but no harder than they were during economic slumps in the 1970s and early 1980s . <p> Even bankers who complain loudest about regulatory overload say the main reason they are n't lending is because borrowers are n't asking for loans . " Business lending is down because demand is down , " says Samuel McCullough , CEO of Meridian Bancorp in Reading , Pa . The key , he says , is creating " an atmosphere where more demand is out there . " <p> Economists say other parts of Clinton 's economic agenda especially tax breaks for businesses that buy equipment might do more to help the economy and create jobs than his assault on the credit crunch . <p> Business loans shrink Commercial and industrial loans outstanding ( in billions ) : Quarters 1990 1991 1992 1 $ 623 $ 606 $ 552 2 $ 621 $ 589 $ 546 3 $ 621 $ 572 $ 539 4 $ 615 $ 559 $ 536
