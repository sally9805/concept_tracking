Milwaukee 's spectrum school for pregnant and at-risk teens tried hard to keep God at arm 's length . The private school was established in buildings next to a Catholic parish , but the school went through the formality of buying the property from the church for $1 . The teacher providing the students with moral direction was not a priest but a former priest . And , yes , there was a giant cross carved in the side of one of the school 's buildings , but it was covered over with a cross-shaped air-conditioning unit . <P> Private schools like Spectrum had good financial reason to exclude religion . Under Milwaukee 's pioneering school-voucher program , poor families got state-funded vouchers for tuition at public or private schools . The catch was that the vouchers could not be used at religious schools , on the ground that it would violate the principle of church-state separation . <P> Well , God can come back now , thanks to a ruling last week by Wisconsin 's highest court that there is no such constitutional problem . The Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vouchers , and both sides in the bitter national debate over vouchers are calling this a watershed decision . " It has amazing potential to shake up the political landscape , " says Clint Bolick of the Institute of Justice , which argues for voucher programs around the country . But opponents insist the court got the First Amendment law wrong and say they will win if the case goes to the U.S. Supreme Court . <P> For years school vouchers were the darling of conservatives like University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman , but they seemed more like an academic exercise than achievable public policy . Factor in the fierce opposition of teachers ' unions , which view vouchers as a threat to jobs , and they seemed like a very long shot . But lately vouchers have been picking up steam . Democrats like Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist and former New York Congressman Floyd Flake have joined Republicans in advocating school choice . And last week venture capitalist Ted Forstmann and Wal-Mart heir John Walton announced the Children 's Scholarship Fund , a $200 million initiative to provide scholarships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Supporters of the use of vouchers for religious schools say they 're eager for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling . In fact , Bolick says his group would support an appeal of the Wisconsin decision even though it won below . But Barry Lynn , of Americans United for Separation of Church and State , says voucher backers are celebrating too soon . The current conservative court has never endorsed the kind of direct state funding of religious institutions that a school voucher represents . " Every parochial school is first and foremost a ministry , " says Lynn . " The court has moved , but it has n't moved that far . " <P>  --  By Adam Cohen
