VIRGINIA <p> It 's too much , I think . It 's too much that she is only two classes ahead of me , and I get to see her every day . Seventh grade , fifth grade . That 's not so far apart , is it ? I see her walk down the hallway with her long blond hair and her perfectly pleated uniform and the cool way she rolls her socks over the tops of her shoes , and I want to scream . Even her name is the most beautiful-sounding name ever : Virginia . Virginia McAllen . Virginia A. McAllen . I write her name on the inside of my notebook , just to see how it feels . I make all the A 's special with a curlycue . I dot the I 's with a heart . I add my own name , make it like hers , the two A 's joined : Ana . VirginiAna . She is the most perfect girl in the whole school . <p> Oh , and her hair ! Down to her waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted hair like that . My hair is , well , I do n't want talk about it . I do n't like my hair . Brown and fuzzy . A little helmet . It 's good for running and swimming and that 's about it . If I let it grow , it turns into one big frizz . But Virginia 's hair , you could be ugly with that hair and still be beautiful . I could look the way I do and just because I had hair like that , I 'd never feel ashamed . <p> Brushing it . I 'd like to brush it out for her . A long wooden-handled brush , like the one Mamita uses on Elena . I 'd start at the part and work slowly downward . I 'd never pull . I 'd never hurt her . I 'd smooth out the kinks and make her hair gleam like Sundays . Keep on going , she 'd tell me . If I found a knot , I 'd press it gently between my fingers , unthreading it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it . If I could n't undo the knot , I 'd take Mama 's best sewing scissors and snip it out , hair by hair . I 'd put the rat 's nests together in a special sack , embroidered with stars . I could put the pillow under my head and lie there on my quilt , smelling her hair around me . <p> I love her voice . She sounds so good singing at the weekly assembly , when the boys come up the street from St. Matthew 's . Her voice is like a little dove . When I pass out the xeroxes , the boys ignore me and keep punching each other , but with Virginia , they sit up , they watch . They know she 's a princess . Gliding down the aisle in her new buckle shoes , like a breeze in forsythia . Touch me , Virginia , I feel like calling out . She smiles at me like she smiles at everyone else , but there 's something faraway about it . This is pretty much her only flaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should be so pretty and neat and popular and talented . One person should not have all those things at the same time . But most of us accept this because she IS like a princess , and it is only natural that a person who is a princess should be perfect and full of grace , and in this way she is a princess for us all . <p> She is a princess for all of us . St. Matthew 's and St. Lucia 's . Every school should have one , and for both our schools , Virginia is it . It is the same thing as having the Madonna come down in your midst and seek you out . Our Father in Heaven does do favors and it 's true he sometimes works miracles among us . This was the lesson when they read to us about Mary and the Angel , and I thought , oh my God , that 's Virginia . I got so excited that my arm started to itch right there . It spread to my leg and I wanted to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press my face into the clover . Virginia is our Mary . Virginia is our Princess . Virginia is It . <p> I want to be around her . The feeling is so strong . The girls who hang out in the first-floor bathroom are starting to say things about her . " She thinks she 's better than everybody else . She thinks she 's so pretty . She acts like a flirt . She does things with boys . " " Stop it , " I say . " I know you do n't mean it . I know you like it when she sings . You 're just jealous , that 's all . " " No , we 're not . She 's stuck up . She flips her hair around so everyone will look at her . She kisses up to the music teacher so he will let her be the soloist . She uses people . " They stub out their cigarettes in the sink and leave . I am left with the smell of their cigarettes . I worry that the smell will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eat lunch with the other girls from fifth grade . Virginia sits on the window side of the cafeteria , with the older girls . They bunch up close to her table , the wax paper from their sandwiches spread out on their laps . They know there is something special about her , something shiny that actually rubs off . They walk around the rest of the day , radiant , like stars . The other day , in the lunch line , they ran out of vanilla pudding so I gave her mine . When I ran back across the cafeteria to my table , I felt my cheeks burning ; my heart was pounding . " Brownnoser , " my friends teased me . They asked me why I would bother doing something like that , when she does n't even see us or talk to us fifth-graders ? I stuffed my napkin into my empty milk carton and folded it shut . <p> " She knows me , " I told them . " She just ca n't make a big deal out of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , folding my milk carton even smaller . <p> There 's a big Valentines Day dance with St. Matthew 's coming up . Everybody 's talking about it . There are posters all over the walls . It 's just for seventh- and eighth-graders , but everybody 's into it . This year they 're having it in the boys ' school , in the new gym . Sister Claire says that seventh grade is too young to dance with boys , but nobody listens to her . My friends and I practice the dances during recess in back of the dumpsters , where no one can see . There 's the Glide and the Bump and the newest one , the Perfect Ten . My sister showed me it . You walk like you 're on a balance beam and then you pivot a couple times and at the end you arch your back and throw your arms up . Like Olga Korbut . I 've almost got it down . We do n't practice any of the slow dances . They just happen , my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance with one of the boys from St. Matthew 's : the tall , skinny one with the big nose and the dark eyes , like a camel . Camel Eyes would put his hand on her waist and the other hand in hers , like a waltz . They would go around and around like that , her white-blond hair swirling around them . He would be too in awe , too nervous to speak . At the end of the dance , he would lead her to the punch bowl and pour her a cup . The punch would be that deep , cherry-red color , with little pieces of fruit in it . The other boys would be crowding around : " Excuse me , can I have the next dance , Virginia ? " She would hand the punch back to Camel Eyes and give him a sorrowful look : " I 'm sorry . I 've promised the rest of the songs to the other boys . I have to go . Farewell . " Camel Eyes would stand there holding both cups , watching Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock , " or something fast like that . He would want to die . <p> It 's the 14th of February already . I make Valentines for everybody I can think of . Hers I make special with an extra row of cut-out hearts . It 's too fat to fit through the crack in her locker . I have to carry it around the whole day , waiting to bump into her . My whole body feels nervous . I think I 'm going to explode . Last period I get a pass to the nurse and go wait by the top of the stairs . I stand there picking the green paint off the railing and keeping a lookout . I have it all worked out . It 's going to be perfect . " Have fun at the dance tonight , Virginia , " I 'll say . " Oh , and by the way , this is for you . " Very casual-like . No big deal . I mean , it 's normal to give Valentines , right ? She 'll turn it over front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell by her face this is the best card she ever got : " Oh , thank you , Ana . It 's beautiful . You made this ? " Her voice will be quiet , shy , like a dove . Her smile wo n't be faraway this time , but real , for me , for Ana . <p> The bell rings . It 's 3:15 . Everyone rushes out of the classrooms . All these little kids pushing and shoving , these itchy green and blue uniforms they ca n't wait to get out of . They bang down the metal staircase next to me like a herd of elephants . Bang . Bang . Bang . I squeeze against the railing so as to not to get run over . Then I see her at the other end of the hallway with a group of friends . She 's got her hair in a ponytail , a pink ribbon around it . My hands start to sweat . I touch my hair , the too-short frizz . I want so badly to push through this crowd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her . I start walking forward , nudging third- and fourth-graders with my elbows . Nobody wants to let me through . I 'm halfway down the hallway . I have to stand on tip-toe to see over the bigger kids ' heads . Virginia 's friends are lined up with their arms crossed over their chests . One of them unfolds a piece of notebook paper and starts reading it . They laugh . Virginia 's face is angry , red . She tosses her ponytail over her shoulder . A girl with dark hair pulls Virginia 's book bag off of her shoulder . It looks like a fight . I ca n't believe this is happening . I keep walking anyway , head down like a helmet , the card hugged to my chest so no one will bump into it . <p> " Ana , " someone calls . <p> I turn and freeze . It 's Sister Maria , waving to me by the gym . She plows through the screaming kids , blowing on her whistle . Sister Maria is my coach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spanish . " You were n't trying to skip out on practice , were you ? " <p> I feel like peeling her callousy fingers off my arm and running away , but I ca n't . I 'm trapped . There 's no way I can get out of this . She pushes me toward the locker room . I look back once , to make sure Virginia is OK . They 've backed her up to the other staircase . I 'm short , but if I jump for a second , I can still see her blond ponytail , the red of her lids as she starts to cry . <p> " Good news , " Sister Maria says . She squats down at the trophy case to tell me about next week 's meet with Mt . Carmel . I made the 500-yard dash , plus the broad jump . Is n't God 's Grace wonderful ? I 'm not listening ; I 'm watching in the glass as Virginia runs down the stairs , out of my sight . I have a horrible ache in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to give her the card . Sister Maria is droning on and on . She smells like Tic Tacs . " You 're our best runner , Ana , " she is saying . I have a brief flash of winning , my feet making the giant leap over the finish line . I bring the Valentine home after practice . It hangs on my bulletin board for a while , and then I throw it out . <p> There 's a terrible rumor going around school , and I do n't want to hear it . Shut up , I want to say to everybody . People like to ruin things . I 'm so upset . The girl in front of me is passing notes about it to a friend . I leave third-period math and race to the bathroom . The key on the wooden block hits my leg as I run . I 'm so upset about everything . I run through the swinging metal door , right into the bathroom , without stopping . The water comes out of the faucet in a big spurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I hear it : a low sobbing sound , coming out of the stalls . I do n't know if I 'm supposed to stay or go . I stay bent over the sink , water dripping off my face . <p> " Are you all right ? " I ask . <p> There is just a sob , sob , sob . <p> " Are you OK in there ? " I put my hand on the door to leave . Just a creak . <p> " No , " she says , in a tiny voice . " Do n't go . Stay . I need your help . Please . " <p> She lets me come in the stall with her . She 's sitting on top of the toilet seat cover , legs crossed , skirt hunched up around her waist . She covers her face with her hands . Her blond hair spills around her . I touch her shoulder very lightly . Her skin is hot . <p> " I ca n't stand it anymore , " she sobs . " They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liars . Jerks . All they do is gossip and they 're just jealous of me and I wish to God I never went to school here . I mean , I was only dancing with him . Just dancing . And now everybody thinks , because of that stupid note , because some idiot scribbled all over with a magic marker .... " <p> She uncrosses her legs , and that 's when I see it : a trickle of blood down her thigh . Red , bright red . Her skin is so white . I ca n't stop looking at it . There are invisible blond hairs on her leg . They all go in the same direction . Like a grownup 's . <p> " And then this had to happen , right in the middle of everything , " she says . " And I forgot my thing . " <p> I put a dime in the sanitary napkin machine for her . I have never bought one of these things . My hands are shaking . I keep worrying that someone will come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , it 's practically like when I go to the corner with my sister to buy hers . <p> The door to the stall is partway open . Where the lock should be , there is just a round hole . I hand it through the crack . I hear her crying and sniffling and fiddling with the wrapper , and I just ca n't stand it . Stop it , I want to say . <p> She 's crying in loud gulps . The sound bounces off the tile walls . I 'm sure people can hear her . <p> " I have to go , " I say . " I have to get back to class . " <p> " Hey , wait a second . " She sniffs and bats the roll of toilet paper . <p> I back away from the stall . All I can see underneath are her shoes . They 're black and shiny . Right between them , on the linoleum , is a drop of blood . It 's already drying . I push against the swinging metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm going , " I whisper . <p> " Hey , I know who you are , " she calls out , " I saw you at the track meet . Your name is Anna , right ? Right ? " <p> The door swings shut behind me . <p> The wooden key chain bangs my leg as I run down the hallway , my thick brown shoes going thunk , thunk , thunk . I am the fastest girl in the school , I think . I can run so fast , no one will ever catch me . I see my face , my plaid skirt reflected in the trophy case as I run by . Anna , she said my name the wrong way , the A 's all nasal , like everybody else . Why ca n't they get it right ? AH-nah . Like AH-men . How come no one can ever say it ? As I pass the stairwell , I see what is written there . The V is like a valley lined with angry teeth . The A is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy spirals . " VIRGINIA IS A SLUT . " The letters are thick and black . There 's no way you can wash them off , ever . The janitor will have to paint over it . <p> I jump the stairs two at a time . I 'm the fastest runner and the best in broad jump for my grade . If I keep it up , next year I get to compete in All-City . As I near the classroom , I hear the teacher 's chalk scratching on the blackboard . I slow my steps . I have it all worked out . In the future , I will walk proud and flowing . I will let my hair grow and wear it in one long braid . I will be perfect and whole and wear white ribbons in my hair . I will win first place in all the track meets , and , when they see me , the boys from St. Matthew 's will sit up straight . I will grow four inches taller and I will sleep on the softest pillows that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can feel my words becoming true as I say them to myself : I will not cry . I will not dance with boys . I will not bleed . <p> Article copyright Iris . <p> Article copyright Iris : A Journal About Women . <p>
