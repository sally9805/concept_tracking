She looks like a young one , my father told me , while I was still too far behind him to see  --  Careful now , he said , try not to frighten her . She was smaller than I had expected , and more fragile . Among the chestnut hairs that cloaked her back and shoulders there were longer , thicker strands of black , yet they too had an unexpected softness , and when the light breeze from the hills above the gully blew over her from behind , the smoky down of her inner coat stirred like a living thing against her skin . Be very quiet , my father said softly , but already her ears lay flat against her skull and her thin lids were drawn so tightly away from her eyes that the jaundiced whites jumped and flashed each time a sudden noise startled her into movement . <p> She was the first thing we 'd captured since we started setting traps six weeks before . My father 'd told me what Albert Freel had said , that April was too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was foolish to stalk them while they were still lean and wary with the memory of winter . Albert Freel had a stable of greyhounds , every one the color of foam in the harbor at Larne , and when he walked them all together up the Shankill to the Woodvale Park he moved in the midst of a small , private sea . The false spring had tricked us , Albert said ; five days of warm winds and sunshine and half the dogwoods in the cemetery had begun to bloom , and on the edges of tarmac all over the city bold blades of grass had suddenly appeared . Then the cold had unfolded with the weight of wet fabric , and those who 'd been counting on the coming of summer barely had time to get out of the way . <p> The corridors of the traps we used were long and narrow ; collapsible doors at either end sprang up when unsettled and shut the unsuspecting in . Sheets of metal covered the inner mesh frames , all four panels made for removal : Captives could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid in their grooves with the sound of knives being readied , yet every morning when we went to check them the doors of the traps had snapped shut on nothing , or else were still lying open , though the bait inside was gone . <p> This is how we came to set them . My father had been fixing the floor of a barn when a nest fell down from above straight into his arms . He 'd held out his hands when he 'd seen it coming and then there they were : a trio of fledglings , still blind , open-mouthed , psoriatic with first plumage and the eczema of recent birth . A man from Ardoyne had been on the job with him ; hearing the whistle of small things in motion , he 'd practically bolted when he 'd seen my father with a dry puff of dust rising up from his palms . The man 's wife had had triplets and he needed the work  --  he 'd spent three weeks fitting windows in Ballysillan , ten days in east Belfast on a decorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it but he 'd kept his head down and his mind on the wage  --  but he was growing convinced that his luck was finished , and he 'd taken the nest falling as some sort of sign . Just get rid of them , for chrissake , he 'd argued , they 're done for now , sure , anyway . But my father was thinking of a goldfinch he 'd bought when he was first married , how the smell of fresh linen had made the bird sing whenever my mother brought clothes in from the line . So he 'd shaken the rubble from his cap and whiskers , nestled the birdlings in an old canvas sack , and brought them back home as a present for me . <p> The first evening we had them we boiled porridge and my father tried to feed them with a kitchen spoon . They opened wide when their lips touched silver , but the cartilage kept catching on the spoon 's heavy basin , and the hard , yellow corners of their mouths pulled away . So he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few drops of milk , a bit of sugar , and with the aid of an eye dropper squeezed the pulp in . He fed them steadily till their hunger subsided and their heads started to loll , nodding in time with their impatient breathing and the shudder of their shoulders in somnambulant flight . Well , wee woman , my father said finally , covering the box he 'd found for them with a bit of muslin secured with twine , that 'll be your job from now on . <p> They died on a Saturday about a week later while we were out shopping down in the town . There was a disturbance in the Castle Court complex  --  a suspect parcel had been found on a bench  --  and to pass the time we 'd gone to Bewley 's , where hundreds and thousands roll out from under whenever a teacup or platter is lifted , where even the dust is finely ground coffee and whatever 's left over when chocolate is shaved . But after an hour my father decided that the purchase he 'd forgotten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked us to leave was unlikely to be there when we were let back inside ; so we paid our bill and headed back up the Shankill , through a thickness of people in optimistic attire  --  bright-colored jerseys and unbuttoned anoraks , a few boys in T-shirts , a few girls in shorts  --  all moving with the rustling sound of large , leafy vegetables packed upright in bags . Crossing Berlin Street we heard the explosion . Would n't you know it , my father said , turning back towards the city to look for the smoke . We could have just waited ; it 's all over now . <p> The shock must have shaken the legs of the table , for the box lay on its side on the floor when we got home . We found one of the babies up in the rafters , bits of another behind the sink . The third they 'd taken to the back of the house where they 'd left what remained of him in a heap by the door . They 'd eaten only soft things , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , the fused rubber fingers , the spurred , calcareous prominence of the spine . Woodrats , my father said , but later that evening Albert said no . Albert Freel read spoors like an oracle , and the droppings he 'd found were small and spherical , occurring in piles like end-of-day fruit picked over and scattered by some quick , careless hand . It had to be rabbits , given the evidence . Rat droppings had a longer , less generous shape . The rat is a small-minded animal , he said . Even its feces reveal what it is . <p> It could n't be rabbits , my father answered . A rabbit would never do such a thing . <p> All the same , Albert said , it 's been a bad year . Skunk , fox , weasel  --  rabbit , too  --  everything 's been living off garbage for the past four months . You know what a bad winter can do to a beast . <p> But they 're vegetarians , my father said . They eat grass and tree bark . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert said . There 's no bilberries or bramble round here anymore . <p> Still , when we set the traps it was woodrat we hoped for . My father had chosen the type of trap carefully , rejecting a range of more sensitive models for one which would neither injure nor maim . I imagine his intention was much as it had been the previous autumn , when he 'd caught a boy stealing apples from the tree behind our house . The tree itself was unclaimed property  --  the land it stood on had never been ours  --  but the boy had crossed through my mother 's garden to reach the low branches and swing himself up ; the tender shoots of asparagus and aubergine , the ascending strands of the tomato vines she 'd planted that spring , before she died , all had snapped with the weight of him when , awkward with apples , he 'd stumbled and fallen as he made his way down . The following evening he 'd come back with a basket . My father waylaid him , seized him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the house . I know you , Trevor Irvine , he 'd said , then he 'd made the boy sit at the kitchen table while he tried to explain about respect for others , how nothing should ever be taken for granted , how he could have had all the apples he 'd wanted if only he 'd called in first to ask . In the fifteen minutes before we released him I watched the blue veins at the boy 's temple flutter while his eyes scanned the room for an unguarded exit , his raw reddened fingers gripping his knees . <p> We did n't know what to do with the doe , but my father supposed that Albert Freel would . Albert lived with his dogs and a coop of pigeons in a house at the end of the Glencairn Road . The house had been built on a crest overlooking the city , between two fields of dry gorse and heather where in the summer cows were taken to graze . His dogs were his livelihood , and he housed them with him . When my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them rose with the smooth , fluid movement of silk through a belt loop , scattering like ash to other parts of the room . <p> Now what did I tell you ? Albert said when he saw her . What did I say all along ? <p> So what should we do with her ? my father asked him . <p> Whatever you want . The shops down in Smithfield might give a few quid ; there 's that butcher on the Road does game now and again . Or I 've got a Rex out the back , if you want . Belongs to my nephew . We could try for a litter , though you never know . That might be the best thing , but , with the child and all . <p> Aye , let 's do that , my father said slowly . Shall we do that , daughter ? You 've never seen wee babies being born . <p> Whatever youse want , Albert said . Just so long as you realize there 's no guarantee . <p> The buck was housed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thatched structures east of the Bann . Thin beams of light from the chinks in the stonework transected the space inside its four walls , casting a pattern of loose woven baskets which moved over Albert as he stooped and shuffled , while I thought of magicians crouching in boxes , half-moons and comets decorating the sides , and wondered what they did , where they went to , when the razor-sharp swords plunged in all around . <p> O.K. , Albert said , you can put her down here . <p> The buck kicked like a marlin when Albert lifted him out , a left-handed grip round the base of its ears , his other hand grasping the loose skin on its back . I heard its teeth striking metal as he pushed its head down , into a cage so unfit for the both of them that small squares of pelt were pushed out through the mesh . When Albert stood up , rubbing his hands , a tuft of mahogany slowly descended , tumbling dreamily on long spider legs , and I followed its tentative passage while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the pigeons rose behind me , the air shrill in their talons and bright background laughter in the noise of their wings . Then an acrid smell of discharge rose from the cage , and it was over . <p> Albert reached in again and pulled the buck out . Give it a month , he said . If there 's no litter by then you 'll know nothing happened . <p> What do we owe you ? my father said finally . <p> Would you listen to him , Albert said . You owe me nothing . I reckon nothing 'll come of it anyway . <p> Somebody called for him then so he left us . I stood by my father as he gazed at the doe , feeling the weight of his hands on my shoulders and the twitch of his fingers each time his lips failed to find something to say . <p> You stay here , he said after many minutes , do n't you move . I 'm just going to go thank him properly then I 'll be back straight away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to hold her the way he had shown me , cradling her hindquarters in his oversized hands , but as she was heavier than I had expected it was all I could do just to press her close , feeling the comfort of claws in her protest , the gradual relaxation in her shoulders and ears . I knelt down then , slowly , laid her out on my knees , examined the places where his teeth had bitten her , exposing the intimate undersilk to the surface like so many delicate , floss-tufted seeds . She did not flinch when I touched her , when I lifted her feet and observed their texture , the way the thick fringes of hair curled round to cushion her toes . She lay still when I held her ears to the light and traced the orchid spread of her veins , petal soft and just as intricate , feeling the throb of her pulse in my hands . By the time my father returned to collect us , she had placed her paws on my chest and stood up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p>
