<p> WEST <p> Oakland <p> ( 9-7 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : Getting back to Oakland where the Raiders will once again have one of the toughest home-field advantages in pro football should make the Raiders a contender . The best players in the AFC and a coaching staff with a clue should make the Raiders a champion . <p> THE BAD : If anybody can ruin a good thing , it 's owner Al Davis , particularly if he does to Tim Brown what he did to Marcus Allen . <p> THE UGLY : Whatever happens if Davis still ca n't keep his hands off the playbook . <p> PREDICTION : First and more . <p> Seattle <p> ( 6-10 , fifth ) <p> THE GOOD : The Seahawks finally have a couple of hot young pass-catchers in Joey Galloway and Christian Fauria at a time when quarterback Rick Mirer is on the verge of a breakout season with a master quarterbacks coach , Dennis Erickson , there to help him . This is also one of the best defensive teams in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortez Kennedy . <p> THE BAD : An owner who ca n't decide whether he wants to move or sell . <p> THE UGLY : Whatever happens to the Seahawks if that run of lousy luck they had to endure over the off-season continues into the regular season . <p> PREDICTION : Second , but do n't forget that this team kind of owns the Raiders . <p> San Diego <p> ( 11-5 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : There is n't a tougher linebacker in the NFL than Junior Seau , there is n't a tougher quarterback than Stan Humphries , and there is n't a more tough-minded coach than Bobby Ross . <p> THE BAD : The Chargers are n't going to be taken lightly in any game this season as they were in both their first and last games in the AFC last season . <p> THE UGLY : An aging offensive line that could n't even stay healthy through training camp . <p> PREDICTION : Third with one of those frustrating 9-7 records . <p> Denver <p> ( 7-9 , fourth ) <p> THE GOOD : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kubiak , plus all those skill people on offense , especially with what looks like the healthy return of running back Rod Bernstine . Better yet is the addition of Michael Dean Perry in the middle of a maturing ( Shane Dronett and Dan Williams ) defensive line . <p> THE BAD : All those question marks in the offensive line , at linebacker and in the secondary . Even with Perry , it 's not going to be easy rebuilding the confidence of a pass defense that was the worst in the NFL last season . <p> THE UGLY : The first six games on the schedule . <p> PREDICTION : Fourth again , but the record could be a little better . <p> Kansas City <p> ( 9-7 , tied for second ) <p> THE GOOD : Any defense that features Ronnie Lott as a backup must be pretty good , especially if it has Neil Smith and Derrick Thomas in the starting lineup . <p> THE BAD : Any offense that features Steve Bono as the starting quarterback and a corps of receivers that even the great Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Marcus Allen is still the best goal-line running back in the history of the game . <p> PREDICTION : Last . This is a passing league , Marty . <p> CENTRAL <p> Pittsburgh <p> ( 12-4 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : It does n't get any better than Rod Woodson at cornerback , the best defensive player and the best special-teams player in the league . That Woodson has an all-star supporting cast with him on defense is what makes the Steelers so hard to beat . <p> THE BAD : It 's hard to imagine an improved Steelers offense with Barry Foster and Eric Green playing for other teams . And Neil O'Donnell is still Neil O'Donnell . <p> THE UGLY : The quarterback controversy that 's going to erupt the first time O'Donnell has a bad game and the fans start calling for Kordell Stewart . <p> PREDICTION : First again , but a shaky repeat . <p> Cleveland <p> ( 11-5 , second ) <p> THE GOOD : Who says Bill Belichick is boring ? Putting Andre Rison and Jim McMahon on the roster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might just be the two moves that get the Browns past Pittsburgh . <p> THE BAD : Losing Michael Dean Perry and James Jones to Denver could be an indication that Belichick believes the Browns can play great defense with brilliant coaching and ordinary players . If so , he needs to talk to Wade Phillips . <p> THE BEAUTIFUL : The Vinny Testaverde story . <p> PREDICTION : Second again , but a less boring second . <p> Jacksonville <p> ( Expansion team ) <p> THE GOOD : An immediate home-field advantage and a nice blend of talent on the roster exemplified by the veteran Steve Beuerlein at quarterback and rookie Tony Boselli of Boulder at left tackle . <p> THE BAD : Not a lot of talent on defense , which is the surest way to book a losing season in the NFL . <p> THE UGLY : A coach with a Lombardi complex who is going to be hard-pressed to get any veteran free agents to sign in future seasons . <p> PREDICTION : Third , just ahead of the Bengals . <p> Cincinnati <p> ( 3-13 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter was a positive stroke that should pay big dividends in the standings and at the box office . With Carter and Dan Wilkinson , the Bengals have a couple of franchise players on which to hang their hats for the next several seasons . <p> THE BAD : The only thing worse than an unstable coaching situation is an unstable quarterback situation , and the Bengals have both . <p> THE UGLY : Having to watch another grown NFL owner , Mike Brown , cry about a lousy stadium . <p> PREDICTION : Fourth , but better than 3-13 . <p> Houston <p> ( 2-14 , fourth ) <p> THE GOOD : If there 's an offensive line you would n't mind breaking a rookie quarterback in behind , it 's the hogs of the Houston Oilers . And if there was ever a rookie quarterback with the God-given ability to protect himself , it 's Steve McNair . <p> THE BAD : This is a team making too many changes in too many areas to have any hope of contending . <p> THE UGLY : That 12-4 ( 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the worst in NFL history . <p> PREDICTION : Last again , but they should be fun to watch . <p> EAST <p> New England <p> ( 10-6 , second ) <p> THE GOOD : Nobody understands the importance of offensive-line play the way Bill Parcells does . That 's why Drew Bledsoe is the NFL 's new superstar , playing behind an elephant line that gave up just 22 sacks on some 700 passing plays last season . <p> THE BAD : Parcells also knows that championships are won with defense and strong running games , the two areas where the Patriots are still a bit lacking . <p> THE BEAUTIFUL : Any move that has Dave Meggett returning kicks for your team . <p> PREDICTION : First , but a shaky first . <p> Buffalo <p> ( 7-9 , fourth ) <p> THE GOOD : After taking a year off , Jim Kelly appears to be re-energized , which is probably all this offense , with Thurman Thomas and Andre Reed , needs to turn around . Bruce Smith and Cornelius Bennett are strong enough to carry any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lineup , Wade Phillips is going to look like a born-again defensive genius . <p> THE BAD : After years of dominating the weakest division in the NFL , the Bills suddenly have found themselves in one of the strongest . <p> THE UGLY : Whatever happens if , for whatever reason , Kelly ca n't play anymore . <p> PREDICTION : A strong second . <p> Miami <p> ( 10-6 , first ) <p> THE GOOD : The Dolphins still have the most dangerous passer in the conference in Dan Marino . Adding tight end Eric Green and wide receiver Gary Clark should make him only more dangerous . But more important , the Dolphins restocked their defense . <p> THE BAD : Yes , there is such a thing as having so much talent on a team , nobody ever takes charge . With 19 first-round draft choices now on the roster , the Dolphins are definitely running that risk . <p> THE UGLY : The idea of Don Shula having to go through his last season with Jimmy Johnson looking over his shoulder . <p> PREDICTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> THE GOOD : The roster looks a lot better with quarterback Craig Erickson and wide receiver Flipper Anderson coming in to take some of the pressure off Marshall Faulk . The defense should be stronger , too , especially if Trev Alberts and Quentin Coryatt play up to their talents . <p> THE BAD : Breaking in a new quarterback is not going to get it in this division . <p> THE UGLY : Two games against Miami , two against Buffalo and two against New England . <p> PREDICTION : A frustrating fourth . <p> New York Jets <p> ( 6-10 , last ) <p> THE GOOD : Ca n't really think of anything . <p> THE BAD : Where to begin ? How about with an unstable ownership working on its third coach in three seasons Rich Kotite , a coach who lost his last seven games in Philadelphia last season . Worse yet , this is a team that lost its best offensive weapon , Rob Moore , to free agency , along with Ronnie Lott and all its best defensive backs - the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baggage to hang on the team 's tired old workhorse , quarterback Boomer Esiason . <p> THE UGLY : Every crowd at every home game . <p> PREDICTION : Last of the last .
