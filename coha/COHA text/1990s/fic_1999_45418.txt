Ina 's high school boyfriend , Artie Goldstein , wore hornrimmed glasses and had a large humorous mouth and rough freckled skin . He 'd call her for a movie date two weeks in advance , and remained unfazed no matter how often Ina turned him down . Artie was brash , not suave , not her idea of a dreamboat , but she spent many Saturday nights with him because he was so persistent . <p> " What can you expect from someone who wants to go to business school ? " her best friend Rita said . They longed for boys who wore black turtleneck sweaters and hung out at Caf6 Figaro in Greenwich Village , boys who did n't think Jean Paul Sartre was a hockey player from Montreal . <p> Ina 's mother never liked any of her boyfriends but she adored Artie . " Arthur , let me look at you , " she 'd say when he showed up at their front door on Saturday night . " How have you been , dear ? " <p> " Artie is very aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lack of enthusiasm . <p> " What 's wrong with that ? " <p> He never lets up when he tries to get into my pants , is what Ina should have replied . But this was long before the sexual revolution , and Ina 's mother did n't like references to the area she called Down There . Yes , Artie even told Ina that her acne would clear up if she had sex with him . How crass can you get ? She hated Artie 's pep talks ( " Ina , what are you doing to me ? Come on-Do n't stop ! " ) which always took place in total darkness so that Artie was a disembodied voice as well as hands and lips . His entreaties felt like bullying . There was nothing romantic in what took place between them . <p> " Do you know what your trouble is ? " her mother said without pausing for a reply . " You 're too fussy . Nothing pleases you . I do n't know how you can stand to go through life like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a jewel ! " <p> Unfortunately for Artie , in her senior year of high school Ina found romance with a junior from Princeton . Jordan Berk , her star-crossed boyfriend , was sensitive , moody , wildly good-looking . He was studying classics with a view to being the new Ezra Pound . Though they saw each other infrequently , Jordan attached himself to her with the gift of a four-foot long black and orange Princeton scarf . <p> As soon as Artie read her cowardly letter of rejection , he telephoned and said , " How can you do this to me ? " When Ina detected a note of desperation in his voice , she began for the first time to experience a strong feeling for him . Guilt is a very strong feeling . Then Artie became belligerent . He pierced her with phrases like " shallow , self-involved and stuckup , " and " out for Ivy League prestige . " She hung up on him . <p> Although Jordan was also Jewish , Ina 's mother distrusted him . " He 's an oddball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How can you say that ? He 's a poet . " <p> " He takes too good care of himself . " She objected to his charcoal gray suits " like an undertaker , " and much preferred Artie 's sturdy windbreaker with knitted cuffs , and his socks with beermugs on them , the foam outlined in white angora . <p> Her mother used the same ugly word stuckup to describe Jordan . Ina explained patiently that truly superior people always do seem somewhat arrogant . <p> After Ina met Jordan , many everyday things suddenly seemed smaller than life . She drifted through James Madison High School feeling transcendent . Even her adored Latin teacher , Mr. Steinway , lost his Jove-like appeal . Her apotheosis occurred when Jordan invited her for a weekend at Princeton , and her mother , swayed by the glamour of the occasion , agreed to let her go . There would be a dance for which she needed a formal gown . <p> Ina left for high school that Friday morning carrying her overnight bag and a fat cardboard box containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd head for Penn Station , from Penn Station to a richer , more exciting existence with Jordan . <p> As Ina left school and walked along Kings Highway with bag and box , Artie materialized beside her , looking grim . He 'd learned about the weekend at Princeton and decided he must act at once or lose her forever . <p> " Look , Ina , " he said . " I 'm sorry I was so rough on you on the phone that time . " <p> " No big deal . You 're forgiven . " <p> Then he proposed , standing on the corner of E. 16 Street waiting for the red light to turn green . " Do n't go to Princeton . Let 's get married instead . " <p> " Oh , I could n't , " she said , feeling mostly anger and a bit of flattered vanity . <p> " Why not ? " <p> Ina could see that he was prepared to go into one of his interminable cajolings , this time in broad daylight . <p> " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future . " <p> " Honestly , Artie , you 're making a mistake , " she muttered as the light changed and she hurried along , hoping he would fall through the nearest sewer grating and disappear . He followed and seized the dress box from her hand . <p> " Look , Ina , I 'm serious about this . " Hugging the box under one elbow , he dug his other hand into a pocket and came up with a fat roll of bills . <p> " Where did you get that ? " <p> " I borrowed it from my boss . I 'm ready to get married right now . You have your suitcase and there 's nothing to stop us from eloping . " <p> Elopement intrigued her because it would make such a fabulous story . There she was , heading for the subway to spend the weekend at Princeton when another boyfriend swept her away . Still , she knew she could n't elope just for the sake of a story . <p> " If you do n't come with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and I 'll go to jail . " <p> Here Artie went too far . " Listen to me , Artie Goldstein . Do n't make me responsible for your jail sentences . Thanks for the thought , but I 'd rather go to Princeton and dance . " <p> By this time they were at the subway entrance . Ina stopped in front of the turnstiles because she sensed that if she did n't halt , Artie would come through after her , walk up to the elevated platform with her and tag along to Princeton , haranguing her all the way . <p> Ina was already suffering embarrassment , for he made no effort to lower his voice , and people were streaming past them , smirking . She had the feeling he 'd never surrender her strapless and she 'd have to appear at her first formal in a long nylon triacetate slip . <p> To her surprise , Artie saw her through the turnstile , handed over her dress box , said , " I do n't know why you 're putting me through this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting prologue , Ina had only a so-so time at Princeton . They visited Jordan 's criminology professor who served them Pernod in jelly glasses ; they took photos under certain Gothic archways . After the dance Jordan suggested that they go to Lake Carnegie to " watch the submarine races . " When Jordan went back to his room to get a blanket , Ina understood he meant sex . <p> Unlike Artie , Jordan remained completely silent while making out . Instead of presenting her with an argument as though approaching the bench of the Supreme Court , Jordan magically unhooked her bra without attracting her notice . Of course she did n't notice ; she was melting in ecstacy from his kisses . Ina forgot all about her resolve to save her virginity for her husband until Jordan reached her panty girdle , which was impossible to remove without cooperation . Then she remembered . <p> When she demurred , Jordan did n't say a thing . They walked back to the dates ' quarters , a cramped attic full of camp beds , in total silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting , partly confusion about Jordan 's feelings . In an odd way , she preferred Artie 's torrent of words . At least she knew what he was thinking . <p> She did know that Jordan was in a sour mood because he belonged to the least prestigious eating club on campus , not a club at all , but a mere co-op . Students shared the work instead of hiring cooks and cleaning women , and the membership included many social misfits-kooks , greasy grinds , plus Negroes and Jews . Haughty Jordan found his membership humiliating . " What 's the point of being superior if your religion brings you down ? " he 'd said bitterly . It occurred to Ina that Jordan was attracted by her blonde hair , blue eyes , and unclassifiable name . <p> This idea was later confirmed on a double date with Jordan 's friend from Dartmouth . Ina felt a small shock when Preston casually remarked that the Yids were gaining control of the literary magazine . Jordan did n't say anything . Neither did she . Ina heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jumble Shop , but all she heard at her own table was screaming silence . Then Jordan called out to the waitress for another beer . Ina realized with a queasy feeling that they were both passing as non-Jews . She felt disgusted with Jordan and herself , yet if the same scene replayed , she was n't sure how she 'd reply . <p> One weekend in May Jordan picked her up in his car to go to a gathering in the Village . When he saw her on the doorstep , he looked disappointed and sent her back to change her dress . " That white collar makes you look like a librarian . We 're going to Horatio Street , not Schrafts . " <p> You look like an undertaker , she thought , but trudged back upstairs to change to a black Orlon sweater , bittersweet peasant skirt and black rhythm sandals . When she came down , Jordan was contemplating her parents ' living room with the same look of dissatisfaction . " Why do your dining room drapes crumple up on the floor in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sneer at other people , she thought , but not me , not my family . <p> From Ina 's house they drove along the Belt Parkway to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel . As they entered the tunnel , Jordan looked up at the white already shabby ceiling tiles that appeared about to fall down . " Ah , the Kafka Tunnel ! " he cried with a meaningful smile . Ina knew that she was supposed to return an equally meaningful smile that said : What an incredibly apt literary allusion ! She decided to stare out her window instead . <p> At the party Jordan sneered at everyone they met . Why had she never noticed this singular trait before ? Soon they were having a bitter quarrel about ice cubes . When Ina emerged from the bathroom after sobbing helplessly , her eyes raw and red , she caught sight of Jordan sitting in a big easy chair with his drink in his hand , his legs crossed carelessly , his thin face with its beautiful dark eyes casual and composed . She slipped away and took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton scarf to fling in his face , but unluckily the season was spring and it was in a drawer at home . When he calls to apologize , she thought , I 'll return the scarf , but he never called . <p> In the following days Ina suffered over Jordan intermittently . What she missed most about him was his handsome face and a certain curve of his neck when he peered over at her from his driver 's seat . She remembered his kisses , too , thinking , oh Ina , how crass can you get ? <p> Ina was too preoccupied with her future and college to obsess much about Jordan . She was working feverishly on her graduation program , which featured The Panel-a roundtable discussion by representative students-Star Athlete , Smartest Brain , Best Commercial Student , each chosen for stereotypical perfection . Although these notables would never meet in a typical high school day and would have nothing to say to each other if they did , they 'd have a lively impromptu dialogue , scripted by Ina , for the delight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loews Kings movie palace on Flatbush Avenue . In addition to putting words in her classmates ' mouths , she was to appear onstage as Class Writer . <p> Artie Goldstein was n't on The Panel , since he did n't personify anything special . There was no spot for Class Suitor . Far from suffering over Artie , Ina did n't realize she had n't seen him lately . <p> Before the " Show " as she 'd come to think of their graduation , she was wandering the Kings Theater feeling nervous . She 'd noticed for the first time how huge the graduating class was and how enormous the audience would be . In a side aisle she suddenly came face to face with Artie . They were both wearing bulky royal blue academic gowns and mortarboards . <p> Artie stood there with a certain keen and cocky expression on his face . He must have been wearing contact lenses , for his eyes under the mortarboard wore no glasses and shot right through Ina . <p> " You know , I 'm not giving up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active about you . I want you to know you 'll never meet anyone who 'll love you better than me . " <p> If this were true , it was horrible . Ina did n't know what to reply , so they shook hands . Artie 's final words were , " You 'll be reading about me in the newspapers . " He was bound for N.Y.U. School of Commerce to become a business mogul . <p> Ina did see Artie 's name in the papers , years later , in the obituary column . He 'd become a mogul in rock ' n roll recordings , a line of work that did n't exist when they were in high school . Arthur Goldstein-heart attack at thirty-five-survived by wife and two daughters . Ina felt very regretful . <p> A few years later Ina spotted an interesting photo in her husband 's alumni magazine . Jordan Berk , Dean of Academic Affairs , smirked out at her . He was still very handsome . Again Ina felt some regret . <p> You 're still alive ! How remarkable ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
