The story comes with dust on it , from out of Robert Parish 's considerable past . The place is Shreveport , La. , the time is the early 1970s . The college recruiters are making nuisances of themselves , trying to lure Parish , then a tall , shy youngster from Woodlawn High , to their respective campuses . // One petitioner approaches the Parish family house and knocks on the screen door , but there is no answer . He knocks again , and this time a reply comes in the faint tick tick tick tick tick of little canine feet moving rapidly across a bare floor . Through a missing panel at the bottom of the screen door emerges the Parishes ' dachshund , yapping its head off . The visitor turns tail and scrambles onto the hood of his car , where he remains marooned until Robert , who is watching from the living room , sees fit to call the pooch off . // " I remember that dog , " Parish said recently , nodding when the tale was recounted to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a lot about Robert Parish : that you approach him respectfully , and on his terms ; that , although he is divorced , he considers home just as good a place to be as any ; and that he knows the rewards of keeping the world at arm 's length . Parish is 37 , the oldest player in the NBA , yet he is giving the Boston Celtics perhaps the finest effort of his career . For the ninth time in 15 NBA seasons he is an All-Star . With percentages of .601 and .787 as of Sunday , he is easily on his way to personal bests in field goal and free throw shooting , respectively ; and , with an average of 10.2 a game , he is in the midst of one of his most productive rebounding years . What is most telling  --  for statistics are n't the measure of the man  --  is that the Celtics are comfortably leading the Atlantic Division . // After 11 seasons in Boston , under four coaches , through three championships-only George Mikan , Bill Russell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Parish is quietly , proudly and inexorably still there . // Seems as if Parish , a.k.a. the Chief , has followed Satchel Paige 's Six Rules for Staying Young . // Rule No. 1 : Avoid fried meats , which angry up the blood . // " I agree , " says Parish . " I stay away from fried anything . " // There was a time when he did n't , when he would ingest all things at all hours . That was before he discovered ginseng , racquetball , swimming , mellow jazz , treadmill work , kung fu ( " for reflexes " ) , weight training , a red-meat-free diet , saunas ( " to sweat out all those impurities " ) and good old-fashioned temperance . " It only took me about 15 years to realize that alcohol dehydrates the body , " he says . By integrating all these things into his life he has become ... well , consider this : When Parish 's agent , Bob Woolf , began negotiating a deal for another long-in-the-tooth client , 33-year-old Chicago center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference point . " No , let 's not talk about Parish , " said Bulls general manager Jerry Krause . " He 's a freak . A body like that comes along once in a century . " // Parish abused his body during his tenure with the Golden State Warriors , for whom , lest we forget , he played for four frustrating seasons between 1976 and 1980 . The fans and the press in the Bay Area mistook his loping gait for indolence and his poker face for indifference . They assumed that because he did n't show emotions , he did n't have any . " I looked like I did n't care if we won or lost , " he says . " Like I had no fire . But I 'm a very competitive person . If I was n't , I would n't be here today . " // Yet some Golden State fans went so far as to suggest that Parish purposely stumbled into foul trouble so he would n't have to play . There was indeed a time when Parish wanted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a 6 ' 2 " sixth-grader and woefully self-conscious about his height , and the coach at Union Junior High , Coleman Kidd , had to paddle him before he would come out for the team . Yet as a Warrior , when his heart was truly in the game , Parish was nonetheless blamed for his team 's struggles , and it led him to consider retiring . " I did n't need the aggravation , " he says . // Enter Clifford Ray , the veteran center who was finishing up his career with Golden State . Ray had scars from 11 knee operations and a championship ring , won with the Warriors in ' 75 , that conferred credibility on everything he said . Bearded and with the same faintly arthritic bearing that has become the Chiefs signature , he even looked the part of the wise elder . Ray took Parish aside to counsel him ; and Parish was a grateful pupil . Today , they agree their most valuable discussion went something like this : // Parish : " You know , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray : " You can get that drive . " // Parish : " Oh , I 'm kind of lazy . " // Ray : " You 're not lazy . You 've just never had a purpose . " // Parish : " I do n't understand . " // Ray : " A center 's got to look at one thing  --  the outcome of the game . Did we win ? Win often enough , and people will say you 're the reason why . You 're always going to have stars , you 're always going to have colorful players . But you ca n't win without someone who rebounds and plays defense and brings people together . " // Parish : " But I 'm not as vocal as you are . " // Ray : " You can be a leader without being vocal . " // Parish took Ray 's words to Boston , where the Warriors sent him in 1980 in a deal that Celtics president Red Auerbach actually said would " help both teams . " ( That trade  --  Parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celtics for two draft choices that became Joe Barry Carroll and Rickey Brown  --  was voted , in a recent survey of NBA general managers , the most boneheaded in the history of the league . ) In the crucible of his first Boston training camp , a fortnight that would mark the difference between early retirement and likely Hall of Fame enshrinement , Parish was mercilessly ridden by coach Bill Fitch . " No matter what I did , it was n't enough , " Parish says . " Not that I was in the best shape . But I was his whipping boy , along with Cedric Maxwell . All you heard was ' Parish and Maxwell ' all through training camp . It was like being in an echo chamber . " // Today , Fitch would not be Parish 's first choice for a dinner companion . But Parish soon resolved the uncertainty about his role that had dogged him at Golden State . The Celtics expected him to run , rebound and block shots ; there were others to take care of the rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't 20 feet from the basket anymore . I was down on the block where I should have been all along , getting follow-ups and tip-ins . I realized I did n't have to score 25 points and get 15 rebounds . I could , but I did n't have to . " // And so Parish went about , as Ray says , " formulating his persona as the Chief . " Maxwell had come up with the nickname , after Chief Bromden , the huge and silent playground ringer in the 1975 film One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Parish did n't like the name at first . He had always been self-conscious about his height-ashamed when his father , Robert Sr. , would wonder aloud why his son needed a new pair of pants so soon ; guilty when his mother , Ada , had to take another job so Robert Jr . could have his clothes specially tailored . But on this most intensely scrutinized and followed of NBA teams , Parish happily let the others  --  the Maxwells , the McHales , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. McMurphys of the asylum . As for being nicknamed the Chief : " Now I 've grown into it , " says Parish . " I 've developed the personality to go with the title . " // " Robert wanted to be a great center , " Ray says . " He just did n't know how to go about it . " Now , after a decade , the Celtics have won enough that people are finally recognizing one of the reasons why . // Paige 's Rule No. 2 : If your stomach disputes you , lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts . // And No. 3 : Keep the juices flowing by jangling around gently as you move . // Of No. 2 , Parish says , " I prefer to take a couple of Alka-Seltzers. " // As for No. 3 , Parish has limbs long enough for jangling , but he has always used more carefully considered movements . He had played in college during those killjoy years in the 1970s when the dunk was outlawed . As a result , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he uses at least once during an NBA game today . On balance , however , he believes not being able to dunk retarded his development . " You 've got to be ferocious to dunk , " he says , " and that would have helped me at the professional level . It would have made me more forceful , more dominant . " // What Parish does have from college is his jumper , the one that involves lifting his arms impossibly high , as if by hydraulics , and then squeezing off a shot that arches preposterously high . Kidd , noticing the flat trajectory of sixth-grader Parish 's shot , held a long-handled push broom aloft and thus midwifed the Robert Rainbow . " He 's probably the best medium-range shooting big man in the history of the game , " says Bill Walton , who backed Parish up during the Celtics ' 1986 championship season . // In the low post Parish has two staples , one for each side of the lane . From the right block , he favors a sudden spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the left , he 'll take a righthanded sally through the lane and then unfurl a classic , if not entirely seamless , hook . Paige-like , he mixes up these moves with his jumper  --  three simple things : fastball , curve , changeup . " If you only have one bread-and-butter play to go to , it 's difficult , because everybody 's got the book on you , " Parish says . " And everybody knows I 've got a turnaround jumper . So I try not to be too predictable . " // Rule No. 4 : Go very light on the vices , such as carrying on in society . The social ramble ai n't restful . // " Yes , " says Parish . " I 've never been real big on socializing. " // His basketball career has been that of a wallflower , too . It 's almost as if , when he first put on number 00  --  because they had run out of jersey numbers back at Union Junior High  --  he signed an obscurity warrant . The game has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he chose to stay in Shreveport and attend tiny Centenary College , the unusual combination of a no-name school and a big-time prospect prompted the NCAA to mobilize . Investigators discovered that Centenary officials had used a table to convert Parish 's ACT score into an SAT equivalent  --  so he might be eligible to play . It did n't seem to matter that Parish had chosen the Methodist school , enrollment 750 , because he had two young daughters and felt an obligation to be near them . // Centenary , knowing that it might never again attract a player of such talent , argued that nowhere in the rules did it specifically say you could n't convert exam scores for admissions purposes . The NCAA , being the NCAA , argued that nowhere in the rules did it specifically say you could . Arguments like these are inevitably won by you-know-who , which offered Parish a deal . He could transfer to any other school and be instantly eligible , and Centenary would suffer only a two-year probation . Woe be unto him if he stayed , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years , and two more thereafter . // He stayed , and he might as well have disappeared . Centenary 's schedule vanished from NCAA publications , and Parish 's statistics never appeared in NCAA releases . ( If they had , he would have led the nation in rebounding in 1976 . ) Parish regrets only that he did n't have the chance to play in the tournament against such centers as Walton of UCLA , Kent Benson of Indiana and Leon Douglas of Alabama , all of whom were rated ahead of him . The NCAA never realized that , rather than punishing Parish , it was doing him a favor of sorts . The publicity ramble ai n't restful . // In Boston , too , Bird and McHale get most of the attention and the endorsements , but Parish has never resented or begrudged them that . On the contrary . " I think it 's great , " he says . // This is not to say that Parish does n't , when approached for his views , share small gems . The Celtics ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of thing that happens every now and then on the NBA road  --  was , to his mind , " despicable . " When there was talk last summer of his being packaged in a trade to the Seattle SuperSonics , he pronounced the prospect of playing again for former Boston coach K.C. Jones as " lovely . " Celtics senior vice-president Dave Gavitt had coached Parish for two months before the 1975 World University Games , and on the eve of Boston 's first preseason game last October , he asked Parish to reciprocate with a little advice of his own . " What 's the secret to surviving in this league ? " he asked . " Patience , " Parish said . The Chief may traffic mainly in one-word answers , but he sure makes them count . // Only once in his NBA career has Parish called attention to himself . When you hide your emotions from the world , you can end up gunnysacking them , and Parish is not without strong feelings about Bill Laimbeer , the Detroit Pistons ' center . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just intimidate them , and to Parish , the basketball professional , this constitutes a threat to his livelihood . // So it was that , in Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference finals , Laimbeer nailed Parish with an elbow . By Bad Boy standards , the shot was small-bore . But Parish snapped . He let loose a three-punch barrage ; the punches were n't really worthy of that name , because tendinitis had kept Parish from forming a real fist , but they sent Laimbeer to the Boston Garden parquet . // In green precincts , Parish 's outburst was looked upon as vigilante justice . Bird even called it " that good deed . " The Chief , however , was ashamed  --  not at what he had done but at what Laimbeer had gotten him to do . He had allowed the Parish reserve  --  the key to his game , the source of his strength  --  to be publicly stripped away . " The fine of $7,500 was worth it , every cent of it , " Parish says . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . It was the first time I 'd ever allowed someone to break my concentration . Even Bill Fitch could n't do it . And that 's saying a lot . " // Rule No. 5 : Avoid running at all times . // " I 'm in the wrong profession for that , " Parish says . // In fact , throughout his career in Boston , he has shown a knack for loping again and again to the rescue . His average number of shots per game slowly declined through the 1980s , as Bird and McHale became more established across the front line and as Danny Ainge was integrated more prominently into the offense . But when Bird missed all but six games of the 1988-89 season , Parish 's shots and points jumped , while his accuracy held steady . // The past two months of this season have been similar . From Jan. 6 to March 1 , Bird and McHale were available together for only three games . Yet the Celts were 16-10 in that span and recently concluded a nine-game stretch away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an instructive first quarter at the Forum on Feb. 15 , Parish dropped 21 points on the Los Angeles Lakers ' Vlade Divac and then added seven more big ones in the fourth period of a 98-85 win . On Feb. 27 , after the Minnesota Timberwolves had sneaked back to within four points in the final minute and a half , the Chief came up with a dunk and a jumper to put away a 116-111 victory . After Parish put up 21 points and took down nine second-half rebounds to help beat the San Antonio Spurs 108-98 last Friday night , Bird said , " He looks as good as he did when I was just a kid . " // You already know Rule No. 6 : Do n't look back . Something might be gaining on you . // " I never look back , " Parish says . " Besides , what 's to look back for ? " // But then he sneaks a peek . " Basketball 's been great for me . It 's enabled me to do things I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a livelihood , status and reputation . It 's taught me to take pride in my body . And it taught me patience . I 'd never been real big on patience . " // In the fall of 1989 , Parish signed a two-year contract extension worth $5.5 million . That deal will carry him through his 38th birthday and next season . " I 'm definitely winding down , " he says . " I feel I have three strong years left . That puts me at 40 . After that , we 'll wait and see . " A reserve role , perhaps for a team that 's one backup center away from contending for a championship , would n't bother him at all . " I put my ego aside a long time ago , " he says . // Parish has not missed more than 10 regular-season games in any one of his 15 years in the league . Thus he has been phenomenally durable , even if he has n't always been entirely healthy . " I 've never had a major injury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can avoid a major injuy , the older you get , the better you get . You know the shortcuts and when to pick your spots . You see all the defenses . You 've got to be smarter . If you 're not , something 's wrong . " // Walton , for one , believes Parish will outlast both Bird and McHale . " His body 's younger , " he says . " I do n't see him slowing down at all  --  although I do n't see the fun being there for him after Larry and Kevin retire . Of the three of them , the Chief 's the healthiest and strongest . " // Regardless of when he retires , he figures to be around for a number of years yet . That means there 's still time to gild the nickname Maxwell gave him long ago , to give him one of those Dances with Wolves names  --  something like Rebounds With Colts , or Shoots Like The Sky When The Sun Comes Out After The Rain . The Chief liked the movie very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soldier off by himself , " he says . // Kings have courts , and presidents have appointment secretaries , and dictators have their backsides , which they must constantly check in violation of Rule No. 6 . But chiefs  --  chiefs have it all . They have dignity and respect , longevity and purpose . When Robert Parish finally leaves that tribe on Causeway Street , the Celtics ought  --  double-ought  --  to raise his number into the Boston Garden rafters .
