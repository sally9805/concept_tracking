More than 1,500 professional astronomers gathered in Atlanta , Georgia , from January 12-16 , 1992 , for the 179th meeting of the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) . Among the wide range of topics they discussed were the existence of planets outside of our solar system , the validity of the Big Bang , the probability that black holes lying deep inside the nuclei of galaxies , and the nature of powerful and mystifying gamma-ray bursts in the universe . What follows is a brief description of some of the most newsworthy stories from the meeting . PULSAR PLANETS REAL AND UNREAL . Ironically , perhaps the most stunning news was the announcement of an object that did not exist . Last autumn Andrew Lyne and his colleagues at the University of Manchester startled the astronomical community when they announced the existence of a planet orbiting the pulsar PSR 189-10 ( see " The First Planet Beyond the Solar System , " December 1991 issue ) . Lyne and colleagues based their conclusion on the changing " tick " of the pulsar 's clock , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . The astronomers concluded that a planet with 10 times the mass of Earth must be orbiting the pulsar , causing the variations in what would otherwise be a precisely regular clock . When the updated fellow astronomers on the second six-month batch of observations from 1991 , however , Lyne took everyone at the Atlanta meeting by surprise . He announced that the fluctuations in the pulses were due to uncorrected errors in the Earth-based observations , and therefore there is no planet orbiting pulsar PSR 1829-10 . The problem arose from wrongly accounting or the location of the observing platform  --  Earth  --  during the observations . Computational mistakes had stopped one of astronomy 's most exciting stories in its tracks . Lyne told a group of journalists gathered at an impromptu press conference , " When you think you 've thought of everything there 's still something lurking in the procedures that you 're just not aware of . We 're human , and occasionally we make such mistakes . " However , that was simply one side of the pulsar-planet coin . Another group of astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two planetary companions , and this one appears to be passing all of the skeptics ' tests . " The degree of confidence of the existence of the planets is very high , " says Aleksander Wolszczan , the astronomer who conducted the research at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico . Wolszczan conducted the research with Dale Frail of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory . The object is a millisecond pulsar designated PSR 1257 + 12 , and the radio observations made by Wolszczan and Frail suggest that at least two planets and possibly three are in orbit about the star . The pulsar emits 160 pulses of radio energy each second , and this allows astronomers to use it as an ultra-precise clock . The star is the remnant from a supernova explosion that occurred hundreds or millions or years ago . It measures only about 20 kilometers across but weighs in at 1.4 solar masses . The planetary companions have nearly circular orbits at distances of 0.36 and 0.47 astronomical units ( AU ) . The respective masses are thought to be 3.4 and 2.8 times that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet , about 1.1 All from the star . How could planets exist around a star that once exploded ? The astronomers hypothesize that the pulsar originally had a companion star , and the two existed or some 10 million years as a normal binary star . When the more massive star exploded as a supernova , material from this event accreted into the planets . Unlike the planets in our solar system , the planets orbiting PSR 1257 + 12 are " second generation " objects in that they were not present in the original PSR 1257 + 12 system . Because PSR 1257 + 12 is a millisecond pulsar , the precision of the data gathered by Wolszczan and Frail is very high . " It is far more difficult to mimic planetary bodies with two or more planets involved , " says Frederic A. Rasio or Cornell University . Rasio and colleagues executed a series or computer simulations of the evolution of the system , and found that the observations matched their hypotheses very well . Stan E. Woosley or the University of California at Santa Cruz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch this subject over the next five years , we 'll have many more such objects . This one 's for real . " NEW FINDINGS FROM THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE . Astronomers in Atlanta announced results from a series of Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) observations . " We 're reeling from extraordinary things , " says John Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey . Cosmology was foremost among them . " HST imaging of gravitational lensing of quasars will set new constraints that cosmological models must satisfy , and will rule of other models , " says Bahcall . The so-called Snapshot Survey uses HST to look at the possible gravitational lensing of distant quasars . By studying lensed images closely , astronomers can infer something about the intervening material between the quasar and Earth , because this material acts as a lens to amplify light from distant objects . Such observations may reveal much about what the universe is composed of and where the missing mass of the universe could be found . Observations made with HST strongly support the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards and Technology used HST to measure the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen produced in the early universe . Linsky 's observations , by far the most precise ever made , support the idea that the universe is open , which is to say it will expand forever rather than all back on itself and regenerate . " If the universe is closed , " says Linsky , " then a huge amount of unknown material must be out there somewhere , and this material ca n't be ordinary matter . " The observations centered on the star Capella , which Linsky and colleagues observed with HST 's Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph . They found the ratio or deuterium to hydrogen to be 15 parts per million . This stands as a lower limit to the amount produced in the early universe because deuterium is destroyed over time by the nuclear processes in stars . The important characteristic of the ratio is that it determines the maximum amount of material that can exist in the universe . Linsky found that the amount of normal matter in the universe is about 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless large numbers or exotic , high-energy particles or unknown forms of matter exist , the universe will expand forever . Other HST research also focused on the chemistry of the early universe . Douglas Duncan of the Space Telescope Science Institute described how he investigated the oldest stars in the Milky Way , halo stars that contain fossil elements like those in existence in the earliest days of the universe . Duncan targeted the 15-billion-year-old star HD 140283 , a yellowish , 7th-magnitude star in Libra that is one of the oldest stars known . Duncan round the star contains boron and beryllium , rare primordial elements . The puzzling question centers on where these elements came from . Cosmic rays appeared to be the easiest answer , but Duncan found the abundances in the stars did not agree with those that should be observed if cosmic rays were the culprit . The resulting hypothesis is that boron and beryllium were synthesized during the first moments of an inhomogeneous universe . Two teams of astronomers used HST to probe the inner sanctums of powerful , distant galaxies . Tod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group that has studied the giant elliptical galaxy M87 in Virgo . Lauer found strong circumstantial evidence that the galaxy contains a supermassive black hole in its center that must contain at least 2.6 billion solar masses . Astronomers have long studied the jet of material shooting out or the galaxy 's nucleus , and have hypothesized that a central " engine " must be powering this jet . An image made by Lauer with the Wide Field/Planetary Camera ( WF/PC ) clearly shows that stars in M87 become densely concentrated toward the galaxy 's center , forming a bright cusp or light at the heart of MB7 . The density of stars near this cusp is 300 times greater than that expected in a normal elliptical galaxy . Comparison with theoretical models shows that a massive black hole must inhabit the center of the galaxy . Another powerful emitter of energy , the radio galaxy Perseus A ( NGC 1275 ) , is the focus of a study by ) on Holtzman of Lowell Observatory and a group of associates . Using the WF/PC , the team imaged the galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be young , massive , bluish globular clusters . " Such objects have never before been seen , " says Holtzman , referring to the act that all other known globulars are old objects found in the haloes of galaxies . Previous observations suggest that two galaxies collided , forming the unusual structure of Perseus A. Holtzman 's observations indicate the collision sparked the formation of globular clusters from young , hot stars . CEPHEIDS POINT TO THE HUBBLE CONSTANT . How large is the universe ? This is a question astronomers have asked from the beginning of astronomy . The most accurate technique for determining distances to nearby galaxies in recent times is measuring the apparent brightnesses of Cepheid variable stars . Their precise variability and absolute brightnesses make them valuable and dependable " standard candles . " The challenge is that very distant Cepheids are too faint to detect . A high-precision study by Wendy Freedman or the Carnegie Observatories and Barry F. Madore or Caltech has produced a new calibration of other distance indicators that leads to a determination of the Hubble Constant , the expansion factor that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madore studied five spiral galaxies  --  M31 , M33 , M81 , NGC 300 , and NGC 2403  --  and found accurate distances ranging between 2.5 and 11 million light-years . Although Cepheids are too faint to be detected in distant galaxies ( that would enable a direct measurement of the Hubble Constant ) , Freedman and Madore calibrated the relation between the galaxies ' luminosities and their rotational speeds . This leads to a Hubble Constant of 85 km/sec/Mpc , which lies toward the high end of the range astronomers generally believe to be true . Such a high figure for the Hubble Constant provides astronomers with an unsettling problem . The age of the universe would be no more than 12 billion years , but astronomers have observed stars older than this . This also potentially throws a monkey wrench into ideas about how galaxies form . If the Freedman-Madore data are correct , astronomers may have to rethink their conclusions about the age of the universe and theories of galactic evolution . COMPTON 'S DISTANT , POWERFUL GAMMA RAYS . The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gamma-ray emitting objects in the universe . The study of gamma-ray objects is in its infancy : astronomers using Compton 's Burst and Transient Source Experiment ( BATSE ) are only now finishing their basic survey work mapping gamma-ray sources . " Over 210 gamma-ray bursts have now been detected , " says Gerald Fishman of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center . " And we 're finding that the distribution of these sources is strongly isotropic . " The data show that gamma-ray sources are spread randomly over the sky , rather than concentrated in any specific area . It is highly unlikely that these energetic sources are very close , so the early indication is that these are very powerful , very distant objects . ( See " Bursting with Surprises " by Richard Talcott , March 1992 issue . ) In addition to reporting on mapping gamma-ray sources , Fishman announced the discovery of a new gamma-ray pulsar , the third such object known . The first such object WRS discovered in 1969 , the second in 1975 . Fishman 's object , known as PSR 1509-58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period is 151 milliseconds , so we see about 400 bursts per minute , " Fishman says . " While the other two gamma-ray pulsars emit two pulses for every rotation period , indicative of the two magnetic poles of a neutron star , the Circinus Pulsar has only a single pulse r each rotation . The reason for this , as yet unknown , may help to explain how the pulses are produced . " Compton astronomer Carl Fichtel announced the detection of extremely distant and powerful gamma-ray sources . Four powerful quasars , 3C 279 , 4C-38.41 , PKS 0208-512 , and PKS 0528 + 134 , are among the most distant and energetic objects known . " For example , 3C 279 undergoes 20-day-long surges of gamma-ray activity , " says Fichtel . " During this period the object emits 10 sup 48 ergs/sec in gamma rays alone , which is equal to 1,000 times the radiation emitted by the Milky Way Galaxy in one second in all wavelengths . " " LEADING ARM " GALAXY DISCOVERED . Astronomers from the University of Alabama announced their discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy . Designated NGC 4622 , the galaxy is an Sa-type spiral in Centaurus that lies at a distance of some 140 million light-years . The galaxy has arms that appear to wrap in different directions , the inner arms trailing one way and the outer arms the other . In actuality , a leading arm galaxy forms when the inner arm wraps outward from the galaxy and forms a ring . This creates the illusion that the inner arms are not trailing the rotating nucleus , but leading it . " This is the first observationally convincing case of a leading arm spiral , " says astronomer Ronald Buta . " It has been bandied about for decades whether these things actually exist , and now we know they do . " Galactic interaction is the suspected culprit . An encounter with another galaxy in the past may have caused the gravitational tug on the inner arms that resulted in the peculiar structure . The leading arm shape is made possible by and perpetuated by a huge halo of dark matter that surrounds the galaxy . PLEIADES WAKE IMAGED . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sky , but two astronomers in Atlanta were more concerned with the cluster 's path through the Galaxy than its pretty structure . Richard E. White of Smith College and John Bally or AT &T; Bell Laboratories are the first scientists to create an image or the wake of the cluster through the intersellar medium . The astronomers used images from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite , which shows bright infrared emission in the vicinity of the Pleiades . The energy emitted from the hot cluster stars and absorbed by nearby dust grains warms the grains so they glow in the infrared . The unique feature of the image is the dark " tunnel " that stretches away from the Pleiades cluster to the east . This hole measures some 10 light-years long and is flanked by bright ridges of infrared emission on the northern and southern edges of the tunnel . This tunnel is the area swept clean by the Pleiades cluster as it travels at supersonic speeds through the tenuous dust and gas of interstellar space . It is the first such image produced of the Pleiades cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to trace the motion of the dust cloud backward , which preliminarily suggests it formed about 15 million years ago , in an area toward the constellation Vulpecula . SUPERNOVAE ARE COMMON ! Supernovae , the explosive deaths of massive stars , are far more common than astronomers have previously believed . That is the conclusion put forth by Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , who conducted an automated supernova search experiment consisting of electronic cameras that recorded supernova explosions . In their survey group , Perlmutter 's team found 20 supernovae , most of them in the last three years . This suggests that supernovae occur in normal spiral galaxies like the Milky Way at least once every 30 years , and maybe more often . The greatest increase over previous estimates came with Type lc supernovae , which result from the collapse of the core of a dying star . More than half of the supernovae in the survey were Type lc objects . " These results are encouraging because they suggest we could have a supernova in the Milky Way in the near future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . A Milky Way supernova notwithstanding , increasing use of automatic imaging equipment is helping astronomers better analyze the statistics of supernovae and their overall effects on galaxies . LSB GALAXIES : KEYS TO THE PAST . Increasingly , astronomers are finding that gravitational interaction between galaxies triggers star formation . At what rates , then , do isolated galaxies form stars ? The question is central to research on giant low surface brightness ( LSB ) galaxies being conducted by Patricia M. Knezek of the University of Massachusetts . Knezek has found that these large , faint , massive galaxies rarely have neighbors , and so is studying their star-formation histories . She believes that these galaxies form stars very gradually . " If this is true , " proclaims Knezek , " this population could represent a valuable window into the early epochs of star formation in disk galaxies . " Another study of LSB galaxies shows they have very low metallicities , meaning they are made almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium . Stacy McGaugh of the University of Michigan and coworkers feel this is significant evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant past . " The low metallicities of ionized gas in the LSBs indicate that this gas is still in its original , pristine state , " says McGaugh . " It 's been sitting relatively untouched since the Big Bang 15 billion years ago . " Inconspicuous , not particularly attractive , and without normal galactic evolution , LSB galaxies may nonetheless prove to be a significant topic in the future years of astronomical research . <p>                     @x " LITTLE NOTO-SAN OF JAPAN ... " <p> Sound familiar ? For decades , most of the stories focused on Asians and Asian Americans that were available to children and young adults in the United States probably started like this . <p> In essence , the mention of Asians in literature conjured up images from stories set " long ago and far away , in a land of exotic people ... " , mainly because there was virtually nothing in print that addressed Asian Americans of contemporary times . ( Yokota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more recent years , the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in literature has grown substantially . Not only has the range of Asian peoples depicted and the range of genres widened , there has also been a significant move away from the " long ago and faraway " literature of folklore and historical fiction . Instead , there are books about people living in today 's world from the various Asian countries . ( Yokota &; Bates , 2005 ) . <p> L : WHAT DO THE STATISTICS SAY ? Since 1994 , when the Cooperative Children 's Book Center ( CCBC ) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison began keeping statistics , there has been an average of 65 books per year of the approximately 3000 children 's books they review per year representing Asians or Asian Americans , http : **47;12465;TOOLONG . This accounts for approximately 2% of books published , yet according to the 2006 United States Census ( http : **45;12514;TOOLONG ) , Asian/Pacific Islanders comprise 4.6% of the population . It is significant to note that not all the published books focused on Asian/Pacific Islanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 2007 , the CCBC documented that of the 68 books having significant Asian/Pacific American content , 56 had either an Asia author or illustrator . The CCBC also notes that , " ... well over half of the books ... are formulaic books offering profiles of various countries around the world . " Overall , such a pattern seems to indicate that only a handful of books published in a typical year are recommendable as fitting their criteria . <p> L : THE REPRESENTATION OF ASIANS AND ASIAN AMERICANS IN LITERATURE There are numerous issues related to the concept of representation , but in this article the focus will be on ( a ) the range of representation , ( b ) the authenticity of representation , and ( c ) the need for a " balanced perspective " through a collection of books . <p> L : RANGE One aspect of " representation " is knowledge of the range of countries that should be included when referring to " Asia " overall . References are often made to Asia as individual countries within a continent however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations , cultural experiences , and histories -- from Afghanistan to Yemen , from Hong Kong to Mongolia . In speaking of Asians and Asian Americans in children 's literature , the countries that are represented are typically China , Japan , Korea , and India , with a few others included from time to time . These countries are most prominent in literature or news and are referred to most often . A scan of the current books in print would let you know that countries that are less represented in English language literature for children and young adults are often seen only in series books that focus on the entire world . This dilemma is not easily resolved as the books we would seek are not readily available now . However , there are alternate ways of gaining access to stories and information not readily found in the traditional printed book . One such alternative is the International Children 's Digital Library , which will be discussed later . <p> L : AUTHENTICITY Authenticity in representation is also of particular importance because the there is more of a variety of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential for librarians to look for authentic representation . In fact , eliminating books that are not culturally authentic from library collections and classroom use is paramount , except in cases where those books are used as negative examples . In school and public libraries around the country , there are still books that present stereotypical images of Asians . For example , I know the characters in the Five Chinese Brothers ( 1996 ) have to look identical for the story to work , but why is everyone else in the country , as represented by the book , identical in physical appearance , attire , and even the angle at which they lean in a group scene ? It is not just older books that have problems of appropriate representation . Books are still being published that perpetuate misguided beliefs about cultural assimilation -- clearly representing the idea that we should be proud when we can " blend in " with others . Representation need not always be positive , but should be truthful in depiction and include respectful ways of developing attitudes about diversity . <p> L : BALANCED PERSPECTIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent a culture ; no one book can be " the best book " for representing Asian American literature . In fact , it takes many books to create a multidimensional look at a culture . In seeking a balanced perspective , even within one culture , it is important to include a variety of genres , a variety of perspectives , and a variety of voices . For example , a set of books depicting Japan might include the well-known Caldecott winning Grandfather 's Journey ( 1993,2008 ) by Allen Say . Although the book has an " every immigrant theme , " the story and illustrations are set in Japan and the United States , and explore what it means to call both places home . Ghost in the Tokaido Inn ( 2005 ) by Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler is a page-turning mystery that is set in a true historical time in Japan . The Friends ( 1996 ) by Kazumi Yumoto shows the intergenerational friendship that ensues when children in contemporary Japan become curious about the concept of death . A wide range of books about other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what books accurately represent Asian American literature . <p> L : EXPLORING THEMES AND VOICES IN ASIAN AMERICAN LITERATURE Over the years , some themes have been explored repeatedly in Asian American literature , while others remain under represented . Stories exploring generational conflicts , particularly those that address differences in language and in lifestyle between the older generation directly from the root country in Asia and an Asian American child , abound . Celebrations from Asian cultures such as New Year 's that are equivalent to celebrations in the mainstream culture are better known ; yet other celebrations deeply rooted in the Asian culture , often based on religious beliefs , that have no equivalence in mainstream culture are relatively unknown . There are numerous books about Chinese New Year , but what about Obon ( http : **40;12561;TOOLONG ) , in which the Japanese celebrate the spirits of their deceased ancestors ? <p> There are a number of books set in historically well-documented Asian American common history , such as the Yoshiko Uchida stories about the Japanese in internment camps . Also , Laurence Yep has written extensively about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other historical stories of Chinese immigration , most recently relating immigration through Angel Island . Although the fresh ways of conceptualizing those stories should continue to be recommended ( e.g. , Cynthia Kadohata 's Weedflower , 2006 ) , at the same time , we should be aware of the need for stories that have not yet been told . For example , consider the myriad adoption stories about bringing home Asian babies to America that are told from the perspective of the welcoming family . Such stories as The White Swan Express : A Story about Adoption ( Okimoto &; Aoki , 2002 ) or I Love You Like Crazy Cakes ( Lewis , 2000 ) , come to mind . What about the perspective of the adoptees , now adults , telling their stories ? Years ago , Marie Lee wrote If It Had n't Been for Yoon Jun ; while the story was sensitively written in the voice of a Korean American , it was not the voice of a trans-racial adoptee . In a recent study , Park ( 2009 ) found that only one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written from the perspective of the adoptee . The book Park found was a " self-published " book by a child . Likewise there are a few books that introduce the Hmongs and their concept of telling stories through stitched cloths . Where are the stories of their immigration to the United States and their cultural conflict in settling in a place with very different laws and lifestyles than they left behind at home ? The list of " untold stories " of Asians and Asian Americans could go on and on . <p> Lumping Asians together in one homogenous group , rather than giving them culturally specific voices can have negative consequences . So can generalizations across cultures or including some cultures and not others . Yet , there are some experiences that are shared by East Asian people , many of which are unknown to people outside Asian cultures . <p> One specific example comes to mind : the belief in the beauty of having double-eyelids . The Dalton School librarian , Roxanne Hsu Feldman , who is also Asian ( she is Chinese ; I am Japanese ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to attend a publisher dinner . When I was much younger and growing up in Japan , I was often told that I was lucky to have " futae-mabuta " , which means a " double-eyelid . " Roxanne then told me an experience she had as a young child . Her mother took her to have eyelid surgery to correct ingrown eyelashes , and in the process , a fortunate result was the creation of a crease in the upper eyelid . She recounted the bleeding and swelling she suffered as a 9-year-old . She explained that her older sister taped her eyes every day to create that fold , and years later her eyes permanently had creases so she no longer had to tape them . <p> We were seated at different tables for dinner in a large ballroom when the publisher began describing Korean author An Na 's newest book , The Fold , which is about the very thing we had just been discussing -- eyelid surgery . There was a gasp of surprise ( and perhaps horror ) by the attendees in the room at the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most common cosmetic surgery in the world , and one that is nearly unknown in the United States . As Asian females , my friend and I exchanged knowing looks as we connected to the story because of our familiarity with the situation . In this case , An Na 's book will likely be a " mirror " for those who share an Asian heritage but will be a complete surprise to many who are reading this book as a " window " into the experiences of an unknown world . <p> L : NEW TRENDS , NEXT STEPS It is fortunate there are books by Asian American authors such as Laurence Yep and Yoshiko Uchida as well as illustrators such as Ed Young and Allen Say . The past decade has brought us even more books by authors like Linda Sue Park , An Na , Marie Lee , and Janet Wang , as well as books illustrated by Chris Soentpiet , Yumi Heo , and others . More recently , Grace Lin , Lenore Look , and Lisa Yee have joined them in creating contemporary stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to reach the reading population , and Mitali Perkins not only writes fiction such as Rickshaw Girl , but on her blog , " Mitali 's Fire Escape , " she muses of her " safe place to think , chat , and read about life between cultures . " There are other new trends in published books depicting Asians , including graphic novels . Gene Yang 's graphic novel American Born Chinese explores the identity of an Asian American teen and won critical acclaim . In addition , hooks that originate in Asian countries have expanded the number of available books portraying Asians , such as Waiting for Mama , which was imported from Korea , and the 2008 publication Moribito by Nahoko Uehashi , which brings the rare translation of a fantasy book . <p> Perhaps this marks a renaissance in books being imported from Asian countries , as happened in the 1970s , when books from Japan by Mitsumasa Anna , Tejima , and Akiko Hayashi were among the ones made available in English . Having access to books created originally in the country depicted ensures culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most critical audience -- can recognize themselves in those stories . <p> Another new trend is manga . One can visit the bookstore these days and there are several shelves of books from that genre . This explosion in the availability and popularity of comic books from Japan has greatly encouraged interest in migrant teens curious about their country of origin . In what some may call obsessive , teens even dress up in " Cosplay " ( short for costume play ) and act out the roles in the books . From the classic series " Akira " to the widely popular " Sailor Moon , " manga readers tend to be addicted to reading them . <p> L : WHAT CAN WE DO , AS TEACHERS AND LIBRARIANS ? The teacher or teacher-librarian who is less familiar with Asian cultures and teaches predominantly non-Asian students has to be creative . In order to scaffold students ' learning , educators need to grow in their adult-level understanding of Asia and Asian Americans through reading adult books , watching films , visiting museums , and engaging in other available cultural experiences . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing Asian literature with children who are not familiar with the culture : <p> Read aloud : The power of hearing a story read aloud , complete with teacher-librarian scaffolding to better understand the story can not be underestimated . Children may or may not pick up a book that seems to come from an unfamiliar culture , but they will benefit from the adult " think aloud " that fills in the unknown gaps . Children who find their heritage reflected in the book may take pride in seeing a familiar story being featured in the read aloud . <p> Pair books across cultures : Pair a book from an unfamiliar culture with a book from a familiar culture , and have related themes that can connect the discussion of the books . See Textbox 1 . <p> Refer to a map and/or globe : In the ongoing quest to help students understand the geographic regions of our world , always note the location in which books are set . <p> Refer to resources on the Internet : Even though many Asian countries are not represented through published literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers : Hearing the explanations of people who have more first-hand experiences in Asian culture may enrich vicarious understanding . <p> There are choices for teacher-librarians who want to provide more inclusive collections in their libraries and classrooms , but do not know where to turn for help . One choice , which requires only a computer with an Internet connection , is the International Children 's Digital Library ( ICDL ) , http : **26;12603;TOOLONG . The ICDL has over 3000 books in 49 languages that have been scanned from cover to cover . Readers can find books in the original languages from Arabic to books from Mongolia . However , because the ICDL relies on the donation of book rights , the collection is uneven in representation ; but the availability of original books from countries around the world is certainly to be celebrated and enjoyed . <p> Teacher-librarians can also choose from the award-winning authors and illustrators in order to identify culturally authentic books . Although Asian heritage books are eligible for a wide array of existing awards , the Asian Pacific American Library Association ( APALA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticity of Asian Pacific experiences . The APALA web site http : **36;12631;TOOLONG has information on winners and honor books since the inception of its awards program in 2003 . <p> L : CONTINUING THOUGHTS ... Although there has been considerable progress in terms of the diversity of countries represented , the genres published , and the themes addressed , there is always room for more , because so much of the Asian world is still underrepresented . What worries many of us of Asian heritage is that as publishing companies merge to become larger corporations and decisions are made based mostly on the bottom line , what is likely to survive are the books that are guaranteed to sell ( e.g. , mass market titles and those From the major award winners ) , and the books that are more culturally specific by lesser-known authors will be ignored . <p> For all the children we teach in our schools and libraries , it is my sincere hope that high quality literature depicting Asians and Asian Americans will be readily available , accessible , and recommended . In order for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the books in such a way that authors and illustrators can afford to keep creating , publishers will continue to publish them , libraries will continue to order them , and book stores will continue to make them available ( buy , borrow , circulate ) . Most of all , it is my hope that this literature will inspire us all to understand Asian and Asian American heritage in our world -- to experience lives and worlds vicariously through literature -- while engaging in good reading . After all , books are powerful in helping us to begin to know our world . <p> L : TEXTBOX 1 Featured Pairings of Related Books : " Duck families in the Boston Public Gardens / Tokyo Imperial Moat " Make Way for Ducklings .

What we display and feature , what we read aloud to children , how we engage them in the discussion of books , and how or when we follow up learning experiences , will determine the effect books will have on children . As adults who influence children , we must continue to read widely , reflect on the issues presented , consider the cultural dimensions of the literature , and make meaningful connections to our own lives in order to help children also make connections . But most of all , we must make a commitment to seek good books , enjoy reading , and share that delight with the children and adults around us.  - -  Junko Yokota , from Sharing the Asian American Heritage Experience . <p> L : TEXTBOX 3 Kamishibai Kamishibai is a form of traditional Japanese storytelling .
