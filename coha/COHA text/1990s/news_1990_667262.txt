<p> Time again for my year-end look at the track record of my Friday and Monday USA TODAY columns over the past 12 months . I wish some of my experts could have shown more expertise ; there might have been fewer bum calls . Still , as I look back , I find many of my experts wowed ' em . Here , in order of appearance , are some highlights and lowlights and what the pros involved say now . Bingo : My first Friday column of the year , on Jan. 5 , was a bearish market outlook from the Montreal-based Bank Credit Analyst , a widely respected 41- year-old monthly that caters to the Who 's Who of the business world . Francis Scotland , one of BCA 's four top analyst-authors , labeled the market " a walking minefield . " He saw a possible 2250 Dow by summer , vs. 2780 at the time . The Dow got as low as 2365 in October . <p> Scotland is still a grizzly . " I still think we 're 2250 bound and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " The recession is getting worse . War with Iraq is imminent . That 'll be a major blow to consumer confidence and to the economy . " He also predicts several big banks will fail and merge . Ach ! : My first Monday column , Jan. 8 , was an interview with the usually publicity-shy George Soros , head of the Quantum Fund ( assets : $ 2 billion ) . He 's regarded by some savvy pros as the smartest money manager alive . Soros , 60 , only goes for touchdowns , never small yardage . His strength is his ability to grasp the big picture : the political and economic developments that affect markets both negatively and positively . <p> Soros told me in January that Germany was his top market for 1990 . And he was cautious on the USA because of pressures on corporate profits . He was right on the second - but blind on the first . For all the reunification euphoria , German stocks had a lousy year . Frankfurt 's DAX index is down nearly 19% . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm told , however , that he reduced his portfolios ' German exposure earlier in the year and now has them up an average 34.5% before management fees . If that gain remains intact , I understand his 1990 take-home pay from Quantum , including profits , management fees and his personal stake in the fund , will exceed $ 200 million . It should happen to me . <p> For now , Soros has reduced his investment exposure worldwide because of the war threat . Among his strategies , I 'm told , is short-selling the dollar and Japanese stocks ( betting they 'll keep falling ) . He 's a bull on government bonds worldwide in expectation of lower interest rates . He is fairly light and hedged in U.S. stocks . Travelers ' distress : Pam Weingarten , CEO of Los Angeles money-management firm Pilgrim Group ( assets : $ 1.8 billion ) , made a super call in my March 12 column - a negative appraisal of insurance giant Travelers Corp . The stock closed the previous day at $ 34 1/8 . She forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big worries : Prospects of huge real-estate write-downs and a dividend cut . She was so concerned , she dumped Pilgrim 's entire stake in Travelers , 160,000 shares , at $ 34 a share . It was a super sale . In a surprise move , Travelers later disclosed a $ 650 million write-down against potential real-estate and mortgage-loan losses and cut its dividend by a third . The stock nosedived to $ 11 1/2 before rallying to Thursday 's close of $ 17 1/8 . <p> Weingarten 's update : " I still would n't touch Travelers . The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is coming out with rules to force insurance companies to reserve against all real-estate assets . That 's where all ( Travelers ' ) problems are coming from . " Smalls fall : I 'm a sap for some periodic stories I do on the impending revival of beaten-up small stocks . On April 6 , I wrote of a pro who predicted big gains in a dozen such stocks over the ensuing six to 12 months . What a disaster . <p> The picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen an average 26% since the column ran , more than six times the 3.6% drop in the Dow . McCain was on vacation and could n't be reached . Maybe I should have taken a vacation instead of writing that one . One had to be wrong : My June 1 column matched a bull against a bear on tiny San Francisco-based AT &E; Corp . Its stock , around $ 21 at the time , had soared on investors ' dreams of a potential bonanza from its novel communications product : a pager wristwatch that flashes phone messages . <p> Veteran market analyst John Westergaard , the bull , put his reputation on the line in what has to easily rank as one of the worst calls of his life . " It 's the next Xerox , a $ 70 to $ 100 stock in 12 months , " said the publisher of Westergaard Research &; Publishing Co. , a New York electronic advisory service . The bear , Tom Barton , a partner in the Feshbach brothers ' California investment firm , which is devoted solely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strictly hype . It 'll be out of business in two years . " <p> The stock is now at $ 2 3/8 and Westergaard has distanced himself from the firm . " If they do n't come up with ( fresh capital ) in three to four weeks , you can kiss the company goodbye , " he says . Barton 's reaction , no doubt partly reflecting the fact Westergaard knocked him in some of his commentaries : " I feel sorry for the guy . But I ca n't wait for the next stock he recommends . It could be the short of the year . " AT &E; did n't return repeated calls . Backlash : One of this year 's most memorable columns , the results of which still disturb me , was my Aug. 3 interview with brainy stockbroker Mal Lowenthal , then one of the top-performing veterans at Shearson Lehman Bros . In response to my question about why all the complaints against brokers , he replied : " Because this is a dirty business . Our product is money . And money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come from Shearson analysts . <p> Shearson sacked him . <p> Lowenthal has since joined Wertheim Schroder . And I 'm pleased to say he and free speech are doing just fine . <p> Dan Dorfman also appears daily on CNBC . CUTLINE : DORFMAN : Reviews highs , lows of 1990 's columns . CUTLINE : SCOTLAND : Still thinks Dow is headed for 2250 . CUTLINE : SOROS : German market did n't meet his expectations . CUTLINE : WEINGARTEN : Sold Travelers ' stock before it nosedived.
