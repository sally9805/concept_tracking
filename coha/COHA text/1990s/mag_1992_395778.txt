IT WAS A HOT , TIRED PLACE . THE bleached skulls of little buck mule deer presided glumly from a weathered pine tack shed . Horses stamped and swished flies in the spiderweb shade of a scraggly elm . A pickup ground lethargically up the lane . " One more , folks ! " The auctioneer sounded genuinely pleased . Boone scoured the sweat from his neck as he prodded a thin yearling heifer through the corral gate . The calf sold quickly , mainly because the temperature was 95 degrees and it was nearly 5 o'clock . The fat , florid man with the mike moved wearily to the last table . " Guns ! " he rasped . " Guaranteed . If they do n't shoot , you save ammunition ! " A tired chuckle from the thinning crowd was lost in the auctioneer 's chatter as Boone held a Stevens shotgun aloft . Its worn receiver glinted dully through the dust . " Sold ! Seventy-five dollars and a fine bargain , folks , they do n't make ' em this way any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , it 's your chance to get  --  that 's right , sir , as is  --  collector 's items , Boone , these are pre- ' 64 guns , right ? " Boone could have said these were mostly cheap guns made by companies that had changed nothing in 1964 , but he grinned weakly and nodded because they were all at least that old . The auctioneer downed a lemonade . " And pre- ' 64s , your last opportunity , nothing left after this , men , investments they are , with bright bores  --  what 's that , Boone ? Mossberg , yes , never missed with my Mossberg , never shot it , how about two , two , two , gim me one fifty , okay you tell me , one hundred , ton o ' hay costs that much and all you get is this , "  --  he tossed a cow chip to the leather-faced ranchers in front  --  " start low then , fifty , fifty , fifty , wan na fifty .... " He got fifty-five . Boone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fat man would take 10 percent if they earned up to $20,000 , no matter that Boone had done the work of two ringmen . He held up the last gun , a .22 single-shot . It brought an even forty . That was all . He stared absently at the crowd . His neighbors looked strangely like predators , their faces empty of the old times . " Wait ! " Boone shouted . " Got one more ! " The auctioneer forced an acid smile as he dabbed at the sweat beading his pink temples . Over $20,000 his fee was 5 percent . " Hang on , fellows ! " Boone ran to the battered Dodge and pulled a gun case from behind the seat . He jogged back and scrambled up on a hay wagon , yanking the zipper open fast so he would n't change his mind . The old but spotless Lefever sold for $350 to Buckingham , a local dealer who 'd bought several guns . Boone did n't see the other bidder . He gave the double one last fling to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty black loft of the barn . Deer season came . Boone shot a buck right away in the sagebrush on land he 'd once owned . It was a big buck . That pleased him . He shot it twice on the run with his .300 Savage and was a little sad as he watched it stumble . Sometimes you just ca n't run fast enough . The home place had sold high when cows were cheap . The people who bought it did n't know about the price of cows and did n't care . It was a picturesque ranch with good views from the house and commercial flights to Los Angeles only an hour away . Boone had used the money to pay off his quarter section and finance a log truck . People would always need logs . He 'd still be independent . But people had decided they 'd rather have trees than logs here . The $92,000 Peterbilt brought no bid beyond the value of the note . The bank had offered an extension , but Boone did n't want more time . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber . He had failed to make good on his own . " You 're lucky the school took you back , Boone . Teachers come easy now . " As usual , Harry made sense . Boone had been assigned the fourth-grade class , an easy draw , and comfortable because he 'd been gone five years and did n't want to teach kids who knew more than he did . " Besides , " Harry said , " you can be independent in lots of ways . You do n't owe money . Why not rent out that section , or raise a few mustangs on it ? Then come bang some geese with me . My skiff 's been too long in dry dock . " Boone had shared his goose pit with Harry , because it was his pit and he figured it was a favor to the other man . He had not hunted with Harry on the river because he did n't want to owe Harry for the use of his boat . Mostly , Boone hunted on his own . " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry would say . Or : " Why do n't we collaborate on those long-legged pheasants my dog ca n't pin ? " Sometimes he 'd add , " If you 'd as soon not ante up against my Parker , I 'll shoot something else . " That used to get a smile from Boone , who 'd strike back with witty  --  and accurate  --  denouncements of Parker guns . For a country boy , Boone was exceptionally well read , and his technical knowledge of shotguns was astounding . But lately Boone had shrugged off more verbal barbs than he 'd thrown back . The geese drifted in on November 's first cold sigh . Without the Lefever , Boone tried not to think of them . It had been his first gun , the product of a man strangely like himself  --  Dan Lefever even shared Boone 's birthdate , August 27 . An entrepreneur whose independent ways scuttled one partnership after another , Lefever had struggled where less clever men succeeded . Boone liked to remind Harry that Lefever 's automatic ejector predated Parker 's by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single trigger . Harry took it all gracefully , and , Boone had to admit , shot his lovely C-grade Parker with great skill . One stormy Friday Harry collared Boone at lunch . " Tomorrow will be just right . The grain on the flats was black with northern birds two nights ago . I bought a new cover for my boat and some stake decoys for the flanks of our spread . " Boone started to say that he would not be on the river tomorrow , in Harry 's fine boat , under its new cover , behind Harry 's decoys , but Harry was already off to class . " You 'll shoot my autoloader , " Harry called back . " I put it in your car . Come at four . " You could not argue with Harry . You could n't even reject an obligation if Harry chose to saddle you with one . Boone had earned his release from obligations ; he would hunt as he pleased . In the dark Boone trudged to the marsh through the wet snow . Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half stock pond  --  not goose water , you 'd say . But it was goose water because the river lay 6 miles farther from the grain . Even in gentle weather geese came here , and today the river would certainly be rough . Bitter wind , steady from the north , dashed fat flakes against the decoys as Boone stuck each silhouette in the mud . With numbed fingers , he picked at tangled anchor lines on the floaters , then scooped up an armload and sloshed into the marsh . He tossed the plastic birds out in two groups , leaving a wide , ragged alley between them . DAWN WOULD COME LATE , AFTER an empty thermos . Crouched in his crude pit at water 's edge , Boone shivered . Snowflakes swarmed over him , piling thick on the surrounding sage . The machine-gun beat of mallard wings slid by once , followed , far off , by the galoink , galoink of geese . As the night sky faded , a black horizon appeared over the decoys . Half-dozing , Boone stared at the swirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared , a ghostly form hunching along through the blizzard . He plopped down in the pit with Boone and was careful to cover the Parker . He thanked Boone for setting the decoys  --  " They even look good ! "  --  and for the use of the pit and marsh . It would be short , this storm , but brisk enough to keep some geese off the river . In silence , then , the men shared dawn . But no geese came . Finally Harry said , " I 'm going to brush the snow off those floaters . They look like blobs of ice cream . " He gathered his slicker like a skirt and climbed out of the pit . He was still gone , hidden by cattails , when the geese arrived , low and quiet . Boone swung the autoloader fast and slapped the leader hard with coppered 2s . The great bird wobbled , then went limp . Boone jammed the bead on a straggler , firing even before he heard the thump of his first goose on the ground . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with no apparent effect . The goose could not climb with the flock , however , and through the snow Boone saw it volplane off into the sage . He tried to mark it . " I 've got ta fetch one ! " In the strong wind , he could hear no reply . He 'd thought it was perhaps 250 yards out , so he counted his steps . It was farther . Half an hour later he had not found the goose . Another small flock passed by , murmuring softly . Boone let it go , and waited for the shots , but heard nothing . By the time Boone had flushed and finished his bird , the snow had eased up , but a greasy couple of inches was already stacked on the sage . It basted his slicker and trousers as he strode back to the pit . Harry was not there . The sun suddenly pried a crack in the heavy clouds and spilled light on the marsh . Boone pushed through the cattails . " Harry ? Harry ! " A hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the low ceiling splintered to show bright blue sky , the sage began to drip . " Harry ! " The floating decoys , barebacked , bobbed gently . Boone grabbed his two geese from the pit and walked briskly toward the car , a mile away . " Harry ! " Boone had last seen Harry over an hour ago ; the snow had covered every track . The day was bright and Boone was sweating when he reached the old sedan . " Harry ! " He left his slicker , gun , and geese . He hurried through the sage . At the marsh he pulled up the silhouettes , stacked them , and knotted twine around them . Then he waded out to pick up the floaters . " Harry ! " Looping anchor lines around the keels and clinching the weights tight , he stuffed the decoys into their burlap bags . He stood , breathing hard , on the shore of the tiny marsh and looked for Harry in the tired snow that sagged from sagebrush hills as far as he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped there . Harry came to meet him . " You look wet , " he grinned . " Any luck ? " He peered in the back and saw the geese . " Good job ! On the marsh , I 'll bet . Too bad the wind let up ; that little hole is wall-to-wall birds when the river 's rockin ' . Cup of coffee ? Ellen just made some biscuits .... " Boone slowly turned back to the car . " No . But thank you . " " Wait ! " Harry caught his friend 's arm . " Come in . I got a new shotgun . " He jerked his thumb at the back door , and Boone obliged . " You 're still wet , but this wo n't take long . " Inside , Harry produced a familiar case , and from it , without a word , pulled the 12-gauge Nitro Lefever . " I figure a fellow can shoot autoloaders once in a while without harm , but he 's apt to lose his character on a steady diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has two barrels . " Boone stared . Harry put the gun back into the case without saying anything else . Then he herded Boone outside . " trade you straight across for that Remington in the front seat . " Boone said , " Where 'd you go this morning ? " Harry looked surprised . " Today ? I slept in . Figured one of these mornings you 'd come with me to the river , but if you did n't want to do it this morning , well , I ca n't handle the boat and toss decoys at the same time . " Boone said nothing for a minute . " I 'll have to buy that gun , Harry . " Harry cackled , " No , you wo n't ! I just about had this gun at an auction last summer  --  let it drop because I knew old man Buckingham would sell it for less that he 'd raise the bid , so long as he made his twenty percent . So I bought it the week after . Had to quarantine it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do what I want with this gun , and what I want is to loan it to you . " " It 's not for sale ? " No , it 's not . " " But I 'll owe you . " Harry reached through the car window and hauled out the Remington . " About time you owed somebody something , " he said . " Too much debt makes a man a slave ; but when you owe nothing you can forget how to give . Nobody 's got a right to shut out the world . You included . " Harry told Boone to go home and change into dry clothes and to take good care of the shotgun . He said he would like to try a new spot on the river next weekend , but he needed a little help . Boone agreed to go . He did go , too . But it was his last hunting trip . Boone died before the geese came back in the spring . When Harry gave me the gun for graduation that same year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he told me to take a friend hunting , always . " You need n't loan him a gun , and you 're best off not to borrow his . But do something to put yourselves in debt to one another . Killing birds , like living , is lonesome business if you 've nobody to share the traces . " As usual , my father made sense .
