<p> After more than 24 years of savvy marketing and media relations , the National Football League has built its annual championship game into sports ' biggest event . But it was n't until Whitney Houston began singing the national anthem before Sunday 's Super Bowl XXV in Tampa Stadium that it became clear there might be a way to reconcile celebration and concern . <p> " My heart was pounding , " said New York accountant John Lavitola as he sat at the stadium . " I was at the Super Bowl in 1986 . And this is so different . It was like the crowd was more pumped up for the national anthem than for the game . " <p> With the USA at war in the Persian Gulf , the meeting of the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills in Tampa seemed robbed of its chances for Super Bowl mania . With the marriage of sport and patriotism , however , at least part of the glow returned . <p> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the connection always was there . The Super Bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th of July . " His staff worked overtime to add a flag-waving , patriotic theme to the halftime show . And all week , flags very nearly outsold Super Bowl merchandise . <p> Frank Sinatra , at a weekend concert , tapped a more bellicose vein in sports fans : <p> " I just wish ( Saddam ) Hussein was the champion of the world , and I was the challenger . It would be about a 15-second round . " <p> All week , columnists and TV commentators made a theme of the gulf war 's intrusion on sports fantasy : This puts the Super Bowl in perspective , they said . It 's only a game . <p> Fat chance . <p> The Super Bowl can be disappointing and depressing , overhyped and overcovered . But it can never be " only a game . " Not at $ 150 a ticket for those lucky enough to buy them at face value , and not at $ 800,000 for a 30- second spot for ABC 's advertisers . With 120 million viewers in the USA and many millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more people than have seen any event short of a total eclipse of the sun . <p> That 's why cities such as Tampa are willing to contort themselves like pretzels to host Super Bowls and why fans are known to risk small fortunes and huge indignities to be part of it . <p> " Need Tickets , " read one sign outside Tampa Stadium Sunday . " Will pay $ $ $ $ $ . Or will do your tax return . " <p> Today , Tampa business leaders and government officials start adding up the numbers . Was it worth it ? <p> Every host city has a post-Super Bowl letdown . Expectations soar so high that not even an army of superconsumers can spend enough money to justify the optimism . But this year , the balloon burst early . <p> If the ' 84 Super Bowl , also in Tampa , was " the most party-hearty of bacchanals , " wrote the Tampa Tribune , the ' 91 silver anniversary version " may go down as one of the most hardly partied . " <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Bowl plans an annual Tampa parade and festival sponsored by a rigidly exclusive group of rich white men , Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla . After the NFL heard rumbles of protest from minority Tampans , the host committee got the message and disinvited the Krewe unless membership included women and minorities . The Krewe declined , and Tampa found itself organizing a new " tradition , " a Bamboleo parade and festival to replace Gasparilla on Super Bowl Eve . <p> Then , 10 days before the Ultimate Game came Ultimate Reality , war in the Persian Gulf . <p> For the fans in Buffalo , whose team had never been to a Super Bowl , the two-way pull was agonizing . " In our news , it 's been war , Tampa , war , Tampa , and nothing in between , " says Carol Jasen , anchor of a local TV newscast in Buffalo . " It lends a certain poignancy to this game . " <p> In Tampa , TVs in sports bars and media work areas were tuned to CNN instead of the usual satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate , " the NFL canceled its annual Friday-night bash . Cable 's MTV decided against a live tailgate party . And during a week usually distinguished by conspicuous consumption , the mood was decidely low-key . <p> Malls were quiet . A Friday night carnival in Ybor City , Tampa 's Latin quarter , attracted few revelers . And Saturday 's Bamboleo , under rainy skies , turned out a crowd estimated to be 150,000 , far short of the 700,000 Tampa officials hoped for . <p> Player agent Leigh Steinberg , who annually hosts a VIP group of 300 or so close friends , had rented a cruise ship with room for 400 for a two-hour cruise on Tampa Bay . He had more than 100 no-shows . <p> It probably did n't help that terrorism fears forced the biggest show of security forces in Super Bowl history . Concentric rings of chain-link fences were built around the Tampa Stadium periphery . About 1,700 law enforcement officers , plus another 1,000 private security guards , were on duty . Everyone - including players and small children - were searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzzed ominously over the stadium . And , for the first time the usual blimps and advertising planes were absent for security reasons . <p> No cameras , no radios , no TVs , no electronic gear of any kind was allowed into the game . If the news was hot enough , the NFL promised , it would be played on the scoreboard . <p> For many , the wait to clear stadium security was 40 minutes . But to complain would be to appear , well , unpatriotic . Jerry Anderson , a fan from Panama City , Fla. , said , " I wish there was more of it . " <p> In fact , about the only people who did n't seem to be waving flags or apologizing for the chance to indulge in the usual Super Bowl celebration were those most at risk in the war . Soldiers , Marines and airmen in Saudi Arabia told reporters how excited they were to be able to tune in the Super Bowl live at 2 : 18 a.m . Monday Saudi time via Armed Forces Radio and Television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told USA TODAY last week that the Super Bowl will give him and his buddies " a little touch of home " while they 're hunkered down in tents in the desert . <p> Some have been even more inspired . Buffaloan Mike Kaczmarek , for instance . He 's an activated reservist who now lives in Tampa . Called up Dec. 2 , he has been serving in Europe with his outfit , waiting for a possible call to Saudi Arabia . Last week , he wangled a six-day pass , bought a $ 780 round-trip ticket to Tampa , and was on hand Sunday to cheer his old home team in the Super Bowl . He 'll fly back today . <p> " All the moons and stars were aligned just right for the Bills , " he said . " How could I miss that ?
