Ballerina is a magic word . Any girl who hears it pictures in her mind a beautiful dancer in a sparkling costume , skimming along on the tips of her toes , seeming to fly like a bird . Of course , the dancer in the girl 's imagination usually turns out to be herself " <p>  --  Mae Blacker FreemanFun with Ballet I FIRST MET DONNA RAE EARPS while suspended upside down by my knees . She hung beside me , the new girl from Livermore , not caring if her white tulle petticoat rocked over her head like a motel lampshade or that the elastic waistband on her panties was shot six ways to Sunday , as my mother would surely have said . With her single braid like a flat gold belt snapping the dirt , her narrow , piquant face going redder by the second , nothing was more obvious to me than our destined friendship and nothing less clear than its surprising end . <p> There had been , during our sixth grade 's last two weeks of school , a spotty epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some small difficulty due to my weight , I spun off the steel bar and landed upright in the schoolyard , I showed the new girl what Kristine Leipzig had pointed out to me that morning : a Chinaman 's face staring straight up from my left kneecap . When she asked , I examined Donna Rae 's kneecaps  --  they were smooth and white , unblemished  --  but did n't see anybody . <p> " Who 'd you put there if you could ? " I was panting , another excuse my mother had for enrolling me in Miss Gita 's Academy of Ballet . Besides " acquiring a feminine carriage , " I was supposed to get " toned . " <p> " My baby brother . " Her face , still radishy , looked tragic and closed . " Or my mother . She 's dead , too .

Fred Borcher owned the local butcher shop , and my mother bought meat from him , my father liked to tease , just so they could chew the fat , sling dirt on people they had both known too long , since high school in fact . As for me , whatever demanded a qualmish and squinted view of the world , that 's what I seemed headed for . ( Though who I yearned to be , since Miss Lassiter had made us read her diary , was Anne Frank . A heroine suffering tedious roommates and vicious enemies  --  smarter and quicker than the adults around her . I learned enough , that summer of 1960 , to respect my worry and to understand there were legitimate reasons to fret . I read and reread The Diary of Anne Frank , lay awake plotting the circumstance that would empty me out . ) <p> So while Donna Rae was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be one of two things , a staring or a reading lump . Which is how we wound up at the barre together in Miss Gita 's Academy of Ballet , I to be toned , blah , blah , and Donna Rae to plie ( plee-AY ) , demi-plie d'mee plee-AY ) , pas de chat ( pas d'SHAH ) , and tuck in her spoon-sized derriere ( dare-ee-AIR ) with cool aplomb . <p> From her first lesson , Donna Rae took to the ballerina regime as impeccably as I managed to insult it . Her bedroom became her studio , and while she releved ( re-lev-AYED ) on pink satin toe shoes she was n't even supposed to have yet but that she 'd talked Mr. Earps , who did n't know a thing about ballet except what she told him , into buying , I 'd flop across her pink canopy bed , asking myself whether I would have had Anne 's courage , locked in a secret annex in Amsterdam . Moreover , how would I know unless I devised trials of character , secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could only be incrementally acquired . I fasted , stuck bits of colored fish gravel in my shoes , held my breath until my lungs burned , pierced the skin of each of my fingertips with sterilized needles . I kept a secret list of these things , for what I wanted , eventually , was to shine in moral crisis . I even chopped my hair , that hateful bramble of dust , to look more like Anne 's . One afternoon Donna Rae , who knew nothing of my list or my ambition , thumbtacked white bedsheets over her curtainless windows , switched off the overhead light , lit a circle of twelve white candles , and danced inside her arena of flames . She insisted I take the boy 's part , catching her as she jeted ( jeh-TAYED ) off a small yellow kitchen chair . Later , I helped her write ballet definitions and pronunciations on pieces of paper that she taped to her walls . Arabesque ( ar-a-BESK ) , barre ( bar ) , battement tendu ( baht-MAW tawn-DU ) , frappe ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sur les pointes ( soor lay pawns ) , on and on ; they would make dry , fluttering sounds as she leapt and pirouetted ( peer-oh-WETTED ) around her room . <p> Some part of her grace came from having to dance noiselessly so as not to wake her father , asleep in the next room . I had seen Ray Earps awake once , standing in front of an open refrigerator , and he had looked like an Everly Brother whom fame had not yet reached , or , worse , had bypassed . He worked the same place my father did , Stanford Research Institute ; Ray worked nights cleaning and maintaining the computers my dad designed . Fried-egg sandwich , he 'd grinned , saluting me with a blackened spatula , an egg hanging lifelessly over its sides . He 'd worn a blue shirt with a pack of cigarettes shoved into each rolled-up sleeve . His hair was a darker blond than Donna Rae 's , and it languished in a wide , sensuous curl down his forehead and feathered into a duck-tail at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor at Livermore High before she 'd died in the same car wreck as the baby brother . Donna Rae showed me the photograph she kept beneath her pillow . <p> " You do n't have a picture of him , too ? " I felt inexplicably jealous . <p> " That 's his fire truck . " She gestured airily to a toy engine high on an otherwise empty shelf . " I 'm never supposed to touch it . " <p> So , I decided , the tragic deaths of his wife and son accounted for the overstuffed pale-blue wing chair on the front porch , the granulated hill of silver beer cans , the sampler-sized whiskey bottles stubbed like wet fruit into the leafless hedge beneath the picture window . Ornaments of sorrow . I listened for Ray Earps sleeping on the other side of the wall . I made no noise as I lay on the canopy bed , listening to Donna Rae hum what sounded like Ferrante &; Teicher 's " Theme from Exodus " while she worked her way through demi-plies , grand plies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck me as foreign and nearly unbearable . <p> The one time I got to invite Donna Rae over for dinner , my mother said afterward that she did n't trust her . That was the word she used , trust . She said her clothes looked cheap and badly laundered , her table manners were poor . . . ( THE GOOPS THEY LICK THEIR FINGERS , THE GOOPS THEY LICK THEIR KNIVES , THEY SPILL THEIR BROTH ON THE TABLECLOTH , OH , THEY LEAD DISGUSTING LIVES ! ) . . . her father was obviously a blue-collar type , and even if he was working to put food on the table , it would n't do , leaving a twelve-year-old alone at night . Donna Rae seemed to know my mother did n't like her , seemed used to being distrusted , and never again asked to come to my house . So late Wednesday afternoons , we 'd meet at the corner of Cortez and Balboa  --  the streets in our neighborhood were all named for Spanish explorers  --  and swinging our round plastic ballet cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The academy was inside a Spanish-style bungalow , a house converted to office space , and was protected by a yellowish-green fortress of stately , peeling eucalyptus trees . Sometimes , when the piano music stopped , we would hear typing coming through one of the walls or a telephone shrilling in the real estate office next door . <p> Miss Florence Gita 's constant companion and authority was a slender black stick she struck against the floor or whacked dryly against her long , flat palm as we rallied to keep time . Each week she appeared in a royal-blue , long-sleeved leotard , her wandlike legs in snowy tights , her narrow feet encased in glossy black slippers that reminded me of giant eclairs . A short white chiffon skirt was bolted to her waist , and her strangely marbled blond-and-gray hair  --  shaped into the most extraordinary bun , large as a second head  --  hung like some awful , wilting flower from the nape of her rigidly fluted neck . Her derriere was flat as a shirt box , her hips winged out like a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can not say why . <p> Miss Gita detested me , and  --  stung by the unfairness  --  I detested her back . To her I must have been a living war on beauty , a sullen , wild-haired lummox in twisted , linty black tights , with a derriere like a brick , there by way of my mother 's dream of rehabilitation . I also had insanely high arches . At least once a class I would drop to the floor in the midst of an ensemble exercise , whinnying with pain , gripping whichever arch had collapsed this time , my pear shape mocked in three sets of wall mirrors . I was only partially absolved by being Donna Rae 's friend , and tried to hide behind her gamine shape and passionate clean attention . A dozen times during class , Miss Gita would single her out . Open your eyes , girls , the classic pas de chat , the perfect glissade , on and on . Donna Rae made us all look stilty and bad , an especially embittering experience for Hayley Schmadabeck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second-rate resin-collector like the rest of us . <p> I could n't exactly ask did they die right away , so I said , " What was his name ? Your brother 's ? " <p> We were playing Ping-Pong under the walnut tree in my backyard , a game I played with torpid motions of the wrist or slothful extensions of the arm , my strategy to make the ball come to me , the single , stolid force it could not avoid . Tapping the hollow white sphere , I repeated my question . Donna Rae , her hair stacked up in a " Grace Kelly coronet " ( exactly what she called it ) , answered as she clipped the ball back , and I missed it . <p> " Roland Arnold Earps . His initials turn into the same name as me and my dad . " <p> I was now prowling in the long grass beneath the table , hoping not to be bitten by earwigs . Her voice filtered dreamily down . <p> " Roland died on the morning of his fourth birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bakery my aunt owned  --  we always got our cakes for free . The design on top was supposed to be a fire engine , but when we opened the box it was a cowboy-shaped cake with the name Billy Swan and the number eight written like a lasso . " <p> I reemerged to spank the ball off the table 's left edge , my own trick . <p> " They got killed because somebody at Aunt Dora 's bakery got two boys ' cakes confused . My dad 'll never get over it . Oh , cripes . . . " Donna Rae had just lofted the ball , like some light , blown egg , over our new fence and into the Murphys ' yard . At my mother 's insistence , my father had recently erected the woven redwood fence to better seal the Murphys ' lives off from ours . <p> " Our entire dining room was decorated with little yellow ladders and red fire helmets . The ceiling was hung with red and yellow streamers with a fan blowing up to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . How do we get the ball back ? " <p> If her skipping from one thing to another like that seemed shallow , still , no one I knew besides Doc Hargreaves had died , so what , really , did I know ? Doc had been our neighbor since I was born  --  a bald , avuncular , onion-headed man who wore , year-round , a smelly tweed fedora and a poisonous-colored sport coat in the pockets of which were wrapped hard candies you had to work to pick the lint off of . He spoke in plain rhyme  --  What 's the story , morning glory , Where 's the shoe , cockledoo ?  --  and if it did n't rhyme , he did n't say it . When he died ( of family neglect , my mother said ) his small green stucco house was immediately sold to the Murphys . This distressed my mother , yet she did the neighborly thing and , the day they moved in , carried over a lemon cake and a chipped-beef casserole . She returned , minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like my mother at all . Living like pigs . Dumber than stumps . She forbade me to play with any of the five children , which thrust an unearned sense of superiority upon me , yet also forged curiosity . What was their offense ? What was wrong with Catholics ? In our house no one said grace or gave thanks . My father dropped me at a nearby Episcopal church on Sundays at nine and picked me up one hour later , no questions asked . Hard work , cleanliness , thrift  --  these formed our creed . No one raised the sorts of schmoozy , profligate questions that led to a need for theology in the first place . In fact , as the Ping-Pong ball zinged over the fence , I remembered it was Sunday , and the nearest we came to practicing religion in our house was the pork roast and apple pie we ate every Sunday night , a dinner to which Donna Rae would never be invited . " There 's a way in through the alley , " I said . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among dozens of volunteer maple saplings that had formed a dense miniature forest , and ended up , without our Ping-Pong ball , beside the mint-green stucco house . The Murphys ' dented brown sedan was gone from the driveway , leaving behind a long , oily splotch . It was unusually silent , so I figured the Murphys were at noon mass . We crept to a window and peered in , and what we saw drove us to the next window and the next . The wild disorder I saw in the hallway , in the kitchen , was repeated in every room  --  a squalor like I had never seen , a mess that enthralled me . Donna Rae saw Mrs. Murphy first . She was sitting up in bed , her hands steepled on her mountainous belly . I thought she looked sad and martyred . She was also doing nothing , a concept foreign at my house . <p> " Ish . She looks like a pill bug . " I followed Donna Rae , who had boldly unlatched the chain-link front gate and was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a port de bras , explaining what Mr. Murphy had done to Mrs. Murphy to make her have to sit without moving until the baby was born . " Six fucks six kids . " <p> " What ? " <p> " It 's called fucking , and it 's a bad word . Do n't say it . Swear . " <p> I swore , and later , as Donna Rae leapt , faunlike , inside her white grove of candles , I lay faceup on the bed , hostage to a vaguely thrilling scenario of Mr. Murphy whaling Mrs. Murphy , and beside them the five little whated-into-existence Murphys strung like natural rosary beads , backs turned , sucking on pruny , bitter thumbs . <p> I agreed to meet Donna Rae outside the Burlingame Public Library at noon . Having withstood the librarian 's flinty glance of disapproval , I now sat on a stone bench , feeling the moral weight of seven Holocaust books on my lap . Books were paths that led away from and back to myself ; they were self-selective , uncannily autobiographical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poltergeists , possessions , and hauntings ; the summer before had been horses , Misty of Chincoteague , etcetera . Now it was the Holocaust , and I had just been made to feel ashamed of my curiosity . <p> We had disagreed over what Miss Gita 's house would look like , and when Donna Rae finally showed up and we walked the block and a half to the address inked on her wrist , my prediction turned out to be the more accurate . Miss Gita lived inside a square , pencil-yellow house with blank white metal awnings . Neat but ugly . Clean but ominous . Nothing grew . There were even two plots of dark-green gravel instead of grass . <p> I pointed to the sharklike gray fins of an old Cadillac sticking out from behind the house . <p> " Go knock . " I was crabby because my arms were tired , because it was the hottest part of the day , because the house was so hideous . <p> Donna Rae made it up three of four cement steps before she turned and flitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think when you visit , you 're supposed to bring a little gift . " Little gift . That sounded like a mother talking , but I could n't say that . After all . <p> As Donna Rae , spurred by disappointment , hurtled through a round of pas de chat , pas de bourree , and a vertiginous series of pirouettes , I worried that either her long-flying hair or her leotard might catch fire . I also told her my mother had refused to let me walk down to Broadway until she realized the dog was out of food ; so if I stopped at Fred Borcher 's , I could go . George was a dark-red bratwurst , a " dash-hound , " a dachshund , Rhineland wiener dog . He was twelve , like me , though in dog years that translated into the news that he should be dead . Pink epilepsy pills spiked his specialty food , and his water intake had to be rationed because of incontinence . My mother spoiled George , talking to him in a pippy baby-voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sisal wastebasket in our backyard and watching it twirl frenziedly around the lawn and carom into the trunks of trees . <p> For what must have been the fortieth time , I studied the photograph of June Earps . With her pixie haircut and round , sad eyes , she made me think of a depressed elf . <p> " How come there 's no picture of your brother ? " <p> I was convinced Donna Rae did not possess the same flesh and bones I did . Dropping into a deep , willowy backbend , she turned slightly , staring dramatically through glossy streams of hair . Though I suppose I loved watching her , I resented being her constant audience . <p> " People said except for our age , we could have been twins . We looked exactly alike . Did you bring your money ? " <p> I nodded , having in fact filched five of the newer and less valuable coins from my silver dollar collection , a theft I would record on my secret list and later erase . <p> Broadway , Burlingame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It began with a sign at the intersection of El Camino Real and Broadway  --  a wide , licorice-black arch bridging the street , the letters BROADWAY whitely marching across . It ended five or so blocks later at the train station where commuters made the forty-five minute trip north to San Francisco . <p> My mother had gone to Our Lady of Angels High School with Lou Giotti , now in his corner grocery ; with Fred Borcher , now in his butcher shop ; with Mr. and Mrs. Swenson , now wearing their red-and-white-striped jackets to match their ice cream parlor . There was also a dry cleaner and a shoe store where I could stick my bare feet on the metal plate of an X-ray machine , look through the rubber eyepiece and see my green , twiglike , vaporous bones . There was Sprouse Reitz , where I was apprehended by the manager , Herman Lynch , when I tried eating an Abba Zabba behind the mossy , bubbling aquarium and the pyramid of slug bait . There was a clothing store where , without asking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the lid of the white freezer , and dig out a Neapolitan ice cream cup with a flat wooden spoon taped across it . Near the railroad station was a small , popular restaurant , Vic and Roger 's , where we went almost every Friday night so my dad could order what he proclaimed were the best deep-fried prawns in California . <p> " As usual we 're the only non-Catholics in the place , " my mother would dryly comment from behind her seafood menu . One time we saw Miss Gita there with a man . Our waiter , when my mother asked , said he thought the man was her brother . " Poor soul . " My mother trawled a fried shrimp through red cocktail sauce . " Do n't you wonder how he got that way . " <p> " Fire , " my father spoke through a mouthful , " or birth defect . " He wiped his lips with one of Vic and Roger 's beige monogrammed napkins . " Could be both . Evelyn , quit staring . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always breezed disdainfully by ) was a gift shop two doors down from Fred Borcher 's , run , my mother said , by a Chinese couple who no doubt lived there , like those kind of people do . The shop did n't have a name , so I could n't be sure it was n't their living-room window I was slowing down to stare into , a window displaying a dusty hodgepodge of European figurines  --  shepherdesses and lamplighters  --  embroidered red Chinese slippers , black lacquered chopsticks , imported Irish tea towels , and a row of white ceramic Buddhas like pale , unmollified frogs . A scrim of amber-colored gel paper gave the display a dull , hot , empty-aquarium look . Flies , upturned and skeletal , dotted the window 's edge . I stood counting them while Donna Rae , hands cupped to her eyes , surveyed the display case . <p> " No one goes in there , " I offered lamely , but she was already pushing open the door . The shop 's velvety dark interior smelled sweet with what Donna Rae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering that her mother always loved doing business with the Chinese in Livermore . As my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness , I saw a lady standing behind a long glass counter , her mouth smudged with the same fuchsia color as the rows of curlers in her hair . <p> Donna Rae spoke slowly , artificially . " We should like to see an item in your display case . " <p> Not smiling , the woman stepped out and with a strange stick , like a pool cue with a metal hook , fished up , by its red cording , the clear plastic box Donna Rae had pointed to . She wore blue terry-cloth slippers , making me think my mother was right . These people lived here , and we were standing , two strangers , in their living room . <p> Donna Rae took the box , showing me what looked like a bunch of red foil-wrapped bouillon cubes . <p> " Chocolate-covered bees , " she whispered . <p> " Bees ? " I leaned in to read the gold label . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How much ? " Donna Rae asked , sounding more herself . <p> " Seven dollars . " <p> " Sorry , we have five . " <p> The woman shook her head . Then , because he coughed , I noticed a man in the doorway leading into a back part of the store . They lived there , all right . For some reason , I remembered the joke Tiger Lindemann and Devlin Kuby had taken turns telling me , about a Chinaman , a barrel , and two straws . <p> " Look . " Donna Rae ran a finger across the box , lifting it to show the dust . The man 's voice boomed cheerfully : " Five is OK . " <p> Donna Rae turned to me , her hand out . <p> The silver dollars sagged , an anchor of resistance , in my shorts pocket . " Where 's yours ? " <p> " I have n't got it yet . Come on , Evers . I 'll pay you back . " <p> So there I was , setting my large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me cheerful , smiling , pleased about the whole thing . <p> I started walking home , crossing to the opposite side of the street ( that 's how mad I was ) before I remembered : dog food . Not looking at her , I recrossed and headed back to Fred Borcher 's , took a number and waited , as always , by the organ meats , staring at the stainless steel troughs of kidneys , brains , hearts , livers , the sallow waves of tripe . I had never eaten any of these things and wondered if I could . Fred , a tall man whose face reminded me of a tiny wooden mallet , winked as he handed over the dog food rolled in white butcher paper . <p> I got all the way to Balboa and Cortez before I saw Donna Rae . She was sitting beneath a maple tree , her perfect white legs stuck out , the gift box on her lap . <p> " Want to try one ? " Her boldness as much as anything stopped me . She was undeterred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded myself , these were a far cry from courage . <p> " We ca n't . They 're a gift . " <p> " See these layers ? We 'll just take two off the bottom . " <p> We sat unpeeling the red foil . We set the squares of Swiss chocolate into our opened mouths . Chinese bees , bees ' knees . I waited to feel a leg , fuzz , the eyes , a head , something . There was only the slightest , bland crunch . <p> I thawed out a clump of George 's dog food on my windowsill , wrote on my list that I had swallowed most of it , and by midnight was vomiting so violently my mother was convinced I had the summer flu she 'd heard about . She refused to let me out of bed , much less out of the house to go to Miss Gita 's . By noon she 'd relented enough to let me sunbathe in the driveway . I was on my back , a pair of green plastic goggles over my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , a purple one-piece , the built-in bust sticking up in the space between my chest and my collarbone , when I felt something longish and warmblooded , like George , brush against my thigh . Propping up on my elbows , I blinked off the goggles , then screamed . Charging like a four-legged bullet for the utility room my dad had just built onto our old garage , the rat vanished . Within minutes , my dad was stalking it with a snow shovel while my mother , two steps behind , threatened to alert the county health department to the filthy Murphy premises , where no doubt they would find a ship 's nest of rats . I picked up my beach towel and went inside to eat potato chips and wish I had stayed calm and courageous . Then the doorbell rang , and there was Donna Rae , in a frilly pink party dress , holding a large , adult-looking book on the Royal Ballet . <p> We sat in the wide stripe of shade on my front steps . I twiddled the purple straps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being allowed to meet her . I told her about the rat . Donna Rae did n't seem interested , so I said , " It 's a miracle I was n't bitten . I could have gotten rabies and died . " <p> " Miss Gita liked the bees . " <p> " She ate them ? " <p> " She 's saving them for a special occasion . " One step below me , Donna Rae glanced up with an expression I later identified as guilt . <p> " I 'm going back for lunch tomorrow . " <p> Here I spoke from a stupid assumption . " I do n't have to wear a dress , do I ? " <p> " Evers . I 'm trying to tell you . I 'm the only one invited . " <p> " The only one ? You did n't say the bees were from both of us ? You did n't say that I bought them ? " <p> Donna Rae had a finger deep in her mouth , prodding a loose tooth . <p> " You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw myself in Miss Gita 's academy , pudgy , ugly , dodging behind Donna Rae . I stared at the book on the step , at the ballerina on its cover , brilliantly plumaged to look like a bluebird . She wore a hat like a bathing cap , made of blue sequins , with three white feathers sticking up . Dumb . <p> " If you want , you could come over now and we can . <p> " No , thank you . I ca n't . " I have to go stalk a rat . After I locked the front door , I thought I heard the light , half-ringing thwang of a snow shovel . Then my mother was bullying pots and pans around the kitchen , her territory contaminated , and George , in there with her , had worked himself into a series of gruff , self-congratulatory barks . <p> Sunday had come and nearly gone . The church recessional , " Onward Christian Soldiers , " had boomed like a kettledrum through my blood all day .

I had eaten Sunday 's pork roast and scrubbed the pan afterward , thinking it was a strange upbringing where you were expected to behave at prescribed times like a high-class person , then clean up after that person with your secondary servant self . Much later , I came to see this as the signature dynamic of the middle class , perpetually equipped for poverty , in sly practice for wealth . <p> Now it was dark and I was in the yard , stretched out on the striped , mildewy cushions of our old lawn swing , an unopened package of Oreos on my lap . I was examining , with my flashlight , photographs of the Holocaust . How to react to this ? For a while I looked just at the faces , sometimes looking for Anne . But they were all Anne , and of course none of them was . How to react ? I knew I wanted to be heroic . And underneath that , I wanted to be admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna Rae 's , even grace , was n't as noble or necessary as courage . I was in a state of great confusion . I believe I wept .

I trained my flashlight on her . <p> " Evelyn Ann . " Her arms were crossed on her chest . " Your friend is here to see you  --  at an inappropriate time , I might add . " My flashlight picked out Donna Rae 's white hair . She looked as if she was hiding behind my mother . I flipped the orb of light back down to my book and heard my mother go inside . <p> " Evers ?

" <p> First I heard about Miss Gita 's hair , how , out of its bun , it fell straight to the floor and was a marbled white-and-gray color . Then she talked about Miss Gita 's brother offering to drive her home , offering to buy her an ice cream ( which she 'd refused ) , offering to show her something and then taking that thing out of his pants while telling her what he wanted her to do  --  a thing she could never repeat to someone as innocent as I was  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hid in a hedge of lilac bushes .

" <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " You have to , Donna Rae . " <p> " What if Miss Gita finds out ? " <p> Exactly . A small smug-but-obdurate voice spoke up in me . I became aware , for the first time , of saying the right thing for less than the right reason . <p> " Look . If Miss Gita finds out , I doubt it will kill her , but you can probably keep this from happening to anyone else . " <p> " Weird stuff always happens to me .

Finally , Sandra spoke . I had missed three meetings of the Katy Keene Fan Club . They had n't done much , Kristine added , besides collect twenty-five cents from our one other member , Mitch Nasslund , a too-clutchy , bimbly kid with chronic toe fungus who sought out the comparable refuge of girls .

She snapped together the corners of one of our just-for-company bedsheets and held them between her teeth . " Evelyn Ann . Pick up your end . As for ballet , you have three more lessons paid for , and if your father and I succeed in teaching you anything , it 's that money means commitment . " <p> At that moment George , who had been grinding away on his veal knuckle , sent up a nasal howl , ahwoo-wooing out of his silvered snout . My mother , carrying a folded stack of fingertip towels , followed him . Looking out the bathroom window , she said , " Hell 's bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tragedy in a nutshell . " <p> Two hours later I accompanied her , my hands in oven mitts , trying not to drop her salmon casserole , potato chips crushed like giant 's dandruff all over the top . The oldest Murphy girl , who told us her name was Bridget , opened the door , still in her Catholic summer-school uniform . She said her mother had lost the baby and been taken  --  Mr. Murphy with her  --  to the hospital . Then Bridget took the Pyrex casserole dish and said thank you . Before she shut the door on us , I heard kids shouting , somebody practicing the piano , news blaring on the TV . <p> After our dinner my mother relayed me back with a green jello ring clogged with bits of canned fruit cocktail . I heard her tell my father she felt guilty for having reported the Murphys to the county health department the day before . Maybe because it was just me , Bridget invited me in , though she simply took the jello and disappeared into the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat by myself on a plastic-covered brown couch , sweat gathering under my knees , until a little boy whose hair stood in strange orange peaks , like whipped squash , pulled me through the shambles of a kitchen , where I saw my mother 's casserole on the counter , untouched . In a dim corner of the screened back porch , the boy knelt beside a cardboard box , stuffed his fingers , all five of them , into his mouth , and started stroking the pale yellow down on the duckling nearest us . There were two . The other was tucked into a corner  --  asleep , I thought . Suddenly an older girl , about eight , clattered onto the porch in a pair of red high heels , nipped the sleeping duckling by its neck and swung it out of the box . " Duckyduckyducky , " she sang . The boy popped his fingers out of his mouth and started screaming . I noticed spots of blood in the box , that the duck 's open eyes had a dull blue film , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lump . <p> " Kathleen Elizabeth Murphy , I know what you 're doing . " Bridget 's voice roared out from the house . " Put that poor tormented creature back this minute or I 'll see you do n't live till your ninth birthday . " <p> The girl swung the duck by its neck once more before dropping it into the box and clomping back inside . In a fog of nausea and cowardice , I managed to say I had to go straight home . I ran through the backyard , unhooked the gate into the alley , and , disgusted with myself , escaped into the relative peace of my own yard . <p> The following afternoon , Wednesday , I accidentally ripped a hole in the knee of my ballet tights and tried sealing it with my mother 's red nail polish . I was late getting to our corner and , when I did n't see her , figured Donna Rae had gone ahead . I arrived at Miss Gita 's , panting hard , the thick red blob tugging at the hairs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class ; Miss Gita , she said , was unwell . Noting Donna Rae 's absence , I skidded to my place at the barre as Hayley Schmadabeck turned and glared at me . Betty Trower was wearing a purple leotard , and all her hair seemed to be jammed up inside a fat purple turban . She complimented us . She praised us as if she were blind . She even refrained from ridiculing me , as Miss Gita surely would have , as I wobbled like a damaged top , trying to pirouette across the room . On my turn back , as I strained to exceed myself , my left arch gave way , and I hit the floor like a rock . As Miss Trower knelt and fussed extravagantly over my foot  --  in the process admitting she was really a jazz and tap teacher  --  I was inspired to say that whenever this happened , Miss Gita let me leave the class early and walk home by myself . <p> Coming up the weed-choked walkway , I already saw him in the overstuffed blue chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a lattice losing its battle with an orange trumpet vine , Ray Earps had a can of beer propped on one knee and a cigarette , unlit , dangling from his lips . His head was tilted back ; his eyes were shut . The porch was so small I stood right beside him , an anxious girl in a faded leotard and linty , red-splotted tights . <p> " Mr. Earps ? " <p> He opened one eye . <p> " Is Donna Rae here ? " <p> Now both eyes were open . <p> I raised my little plastic suitcase . " She missed class . " <p> He picked the cigarette from his mouth , cleared his throat , set down his beer can , leaned and spat into the bushes . <p> " You 're who now ? " <p> " Her friend . Evelyn Stoddard . " <p> " Well , Evelyn Stoddard , my daughter is no longer here . " He looked at my face . " No longer at this residence . " <p> Ray Earps stood up . He had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he looked nothing , in his half-nakedness , like my father . <p> " I put her on the Greyhound to Livermore yesterday morning , back to her mother . " He looked sharply at me . " She did n't tell you ? She said she did . " His sigh was pained , yet unsurprised . " Hell , I 'm sorry . Donna Rae 's pretty ticked off at the truth . Meaning she rarely bothers to tell it anymore . Let me get you a soda . " <p> I followed Ray Earps , followed his broad , sweating back into the darkened house . I did n't really need a soda so much as I needed to see she was really gone . The news that June Earps was alive had n't quite reached me yet . Halfway to the kitchen he turned , saw me looking down the hall . <p> " You leave something ? Go ahead , go on in there . " <p> The room was empty , but it had always been mostly empty ; it just felt different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all the ballet words I 'd helped thumbtack to the walls , except for one still stuck to the back of the closet door , releve ( re-lev-AY ) . I was passing my hand back and forth under the pillow to see if June Earps 's picture was still there when I heard footsteps and sat down . <p> Ray Earps sat beside me and handed me a can of grape soda . " That stuff 's too sweet , I do n't know how you kids stand it . Now here 's the deal . Donna Rae 'd come to live with me for the summer ; then , on Sunday I believe it was , she woke me up with another of her cockamamie stories  --  this one about her ballet teacher 's brother . . . you know anything about that , she tell you about that , Evelyn ? " <p> " No , sir . " I lied so fast it startled me . " No , sir . " I dug in deep . " She never did . " My gaze traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your son 's ? " <p> " My son ? No , that old fire truck belonged to my younger brother , who died when he was four . For some reason Donna Rae 's always been partial to keeping it in her room . " <p> " Could she touch it ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Could she touch the truck ? " <p> " Sure she could . I just told her the special nature of it and to be careful when she did . " <p> " She told me it was her brother 's and she was n't supposed to ever touch it and that he had died . She told me your wife was dead , too . " By now I was doing two things , picking off the scab of polish on my knee and starting to cry . " She told me they 'd died in a car wreck . " <p> " She told you that ? " He rested his hand on the part of my back that was bare . Neither of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother and I got our divorce a year ago . She is remarried and lives there in Livermore . As for a brother , Donna Rae does n't have any brothers or sisters . She got herself into some trouble , telling lies about her stepfather , so I told June she was welcome to stay here with me , though I made it clear my place was n't anything like hers , no doughboy pool , no red T-Bird convertible , nothing like that . But like I said before , Donna Rae , especially since her mom and I split up , runs farther and farther from the truth . It 's like she makes things up to be the way she wants . Maybe it comes from having a drama teacher as a mother . An actress . I told her  --  one day it 's going to catch up to you , you 're going to find yourself or get somebody else in deep trouble . Now this business about a man in a car . She 's cried wolf on me one too many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her currency 's about used up in that department . So I figured the best thing was to put her on a bus back to Livermore . Get her out of Dodge . Then again , maybe it was n't the right thing . Maybe the guy really did do what she said . I find it hard to believe . I find Donna Rae hard to believe . Hell , you tell me . " <p> He walked across the floor and stood staring out the window . I had stopped crying and was frankly studying the way his blond hair tailed down the nape of his neck , the muscled , triangular slope of his back . It was male beauty I was looking at , sexual attraction , though I had no words or any real feeling for it then . <p> " It 's nearly dark . You live close , or do you need a ride ? " <p> " I live close . " <p> " Thing is . . . " Here he turned and looked right at me . " June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman in the world to me . The only woman . And you know what 's funny ? One day some joker , some other clown who I should start feeling sorry for but I wo n't , is going to feel that same way about Donna Rae . About my own daughter . What I 'm talking about here is time . " <p> I nodded as if I understood . Then he was lifting the can of soda from my hands , his face so close , the smell of beer so strong , I flinched . <p> " I would lay down my life for that woman . I 've already tried . And to do that for someone who does n't give a rat 's ass about you  --  it hurts . It plain hurts . I wo n't get over this , Evelyn Stoddard . " <p> Only then , as he started to cry , did it occur to me how drunk he really was . <p> I followed him back outside . The house had been so dark and sad that even the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chair , I put my hand out like I had seen my father do . <p> " Thank you very much , Mr. Earps . " <p> He took my hand , startled . Whatever else I 'd thought to say scattered as I looked into his eyes . Ray Earps was courtly and wounded , poor and self-pitying , sensitive and too handsome , the kind of man I would zero in on for years . But I did n't know that then . I only knew how my heart felt , losing its race , how ridiculous I looked in my leotard , how his hand felt with mine , how we were bound by one sweet , irresistible pain . <p> I started for home , half expecting to see my mother out driving around , looking for me . So when the car slowed behind me on the quiet street and I did n't hear her voice , I turned to see instead Miss Gita 's shark-finned old Cadillac , and hunched over the wheel , staring straight at me , her brother . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct to run or to scream . Instead , and to this day I do n't know why , I did the strangest thing , deliberately , as if obeying the shape of dreams . Backing away until I stood on someone 's green lawn , not taking my eyes off the accused , I raised both arms  --  fingertips touching , port de bras , pointing my left foot , tendu , striking it twice against the grass , frappe , and began to turn . My figure whirled , turning , darkness both supporting and concealing it , until the Cadillac was a blur , until it was gone , until with a sharp , exhilarating cramp in my ribs I ran for home . My mother , who had been taking a nap , had not even missed me . <p> On Friday I showed up in Sandra Dougherty 's backyard , quieter than usual , drank lemonade out of a Dixie cup , handed over twenty-five cents for the fan club . I took my turn touching Kristine Leipzig 's newest patch of psoriasis on her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two he knew . I tried to forget what I had been thinking about for days  --  that something lay dormant inside each of us , that only the right constellation of weaknesses could bring whatever it was into the light . And keeping those weaknesses separated from one another was probably all anyone ever meant by being good . <p> I returned the Holocaust books , but not before tearing up my childish list and stuffing the bits inside one of them . I began walking past Ray Earps 's house every single evening . I had fantasies of being his perfect daughter , or wife , depending . Miss Gita had recovered from the summer flu , and I refused to go to my last two classes . I was punished but did not care . I sat in my room and thought about the ballet suitcase I had left at Ray Earps 's house that day , how the time would come for me to go over there and get it back and that I would know when that time came . I stopped reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only what I was assigned . My father complained I watched too much TV , though my mother was pleased I was losing weight , walking for exercise , paying more attention to my femininity . The truth is , things had happened , and it helped to blame other people . <p> I was no longer comfortable with the way Fred Borcher looked at my mother or the way she laughed at his jokes . One day , when I asked , she explained she had been a Catholic until she eloped with my father , after which she was excommunicated . According to her former priest , I , as the fruit of their marriage , was banned for eternity from paradise . I noticed how often my father worked late and , even when he was home , seemed away . I continued to have fantasies about Ray Earps , wrote love poems and letters and stuffed them into a suitcase under my bed . Before long I would be reading again , books I was embarrassed to check out or to bring home . So I stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside more acceptable books . I was catching up to Donna Rae , I would pass her , for beauty was not to be my protector , nor did I aspire , as I once had through false tests , to courage . <p> The more I would learn to shape myself into the kind of woman I imagined Ray Earps might grieve over and want to die for ( though I was never to see him again  --  he would take his own life the following Christmas ) , the more he would become the shadow behind all the boys and men I would open my arms to , port de bras , on my back where I thought I belonged and wanted to be , for all those years , passionate and grasping and full of delusion , to come . <p> <p> By MELISSA PRITCHARD <p>
