<p> AN EARLY REPORT CARD ON HONG KONG <p> Editor  --  The question as to whether China is cracking down on Hong Kong after the " hand- back " and whether the people in Hong Kong have lost any freedom and civil rights with the Brits gone are answered by events during the first week under the new administration . <p> 1 . Street demonstration by 3,000 marchers of the opposition party allowed to take place . Earlier , this demonstration was branded subversive by China . <p> 2 . Local showing of the movie " The Gate of Heavenly Peace , " a documentary film about the 1989 Tiananmen Square event . <p> 3 . Open sale of the " replica Goddess of Democracy , " a symbol of the pro-democracy movement , as a tourist souvenir . Ironically , these little statues are marked " Made in China . " <p> It seems to me that Hong Kong is not showing any sign of slipping into a repressive state . <p> LESTER H. LEE <p> Sunnyvale <p> . <p> TAIWAN RESTRUCTURING <p> Editor  --  I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article , " Taiwan Trying to Shake Off China , President behind plan to scrap provincial government " ( Chronicle , July 5 ) . The purpose of restructuring the Republic of China 's provincial government is to raise administrative efficiency through streamlining the excess layers of government . These revisions should not be misconstrued as a step toward independence . <p> There are currently four levels of government in the Republic of China . Since the provincial layer of government also covers the same areas as the central government , its reduction is a logical solution . <p> Simplifying our provincial layer of government does not mean that the ROC has stopped pursuing the goal of reunification with mainland China . This goal remains intact . However , before it can happen , the well-being of the 21.5 million people on Taiwan must be safeguarded . <p> AMY S. LIU <p> Taipei Economic <p> and Cultural Office <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> COLONIALISM LIVES ON <p> Editor  --  I believe that former Berkeley Chancellor Chang-lin Tien is mistaken in his proclamation that " colonialism 's last day on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Open Forum , July 10 ) . <p> For what he curiously overlooks in his righteous tirade against the West is that China itself is now the world 's most notorious colonial power in its brutal invasion and continuing subjugation of the Tibetan people . Are Tien and his influential group of 100 willing to stand up for principle and call for an end to this humiliating occupation ? <p> LEONARD BAKKER <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> CLINTON 'S RECORD APPROVAL <p> Editor  --  Considering the story 's low rating on the scandal-meter , it is thrilling that the July 10 issue of The Chronicle actually reported that our president received " record-high approval ratings " in an ABC poll and that 74 percent of those polled said they did not care about Paula Jones ' sexual harassment case against Clinton . <p> This majority-approval story received approximately 1/10 the space and 1/50 the prominence of your Paula Jones coverage this month . The majority of us who believe the president is doing a good job are intensely grateful to see our majority viewpoint appear in the front section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it , that despite the most fervent efforts of the press to lampoon Bill Clinton , the bulk of the public is drawing its conclusions based on his successes ? <p> EILEEN LARSEN <p> Foster City <p> . <p> RESTORE RENTER 'S CREDIT <p> Editor  --  As a recent college graduate trying to achieve some kind of financial stability while paying off student loans , I can never seem to buffer the hard hit of monthly rent . Even though I share a home with several people , the incredibly high cost of rent in the Bay Area weighs on my shoulders while emptying my pockets . <p> Reinstating the $ 60 a year tax credit for California renters would help . This amount may seem minuscule , but it would definitely be useful to renters , three- fourths of whom earn less than $ 30,000 a year . After last year 's immense tax break to the rich , low- and middle-income tax payers are long due this credit reinstatement . <p> SARA BLACK <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> CANCER SCREENING <p> Editor  --  The medical authors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forum , July 9 ) described with commendable candor their view summarized in the title , as one that " might seem contrary to intuitive good sense . " Indeed it does , and it is . <p> The problem is not one of stupidity on their part , but of confusion . A confusion that is shared by much of the public discussion of similar medical issues . <p> It simply can not be disputed that for an individual man the PSA test for prostate cancer will provide information . Information is knowledge . More knowledge , more choices . Knowledge leads to truth and " the truth shall set you free , " or at least may save your life or prolong it . <p> Where the writers go wrong is in confusing an individual 's deci sion on testing , and medical advice to that individual about testing , with the public policy issue of whether society will benefit from widespread screenings . <p> Here the statistical questions of ill-advised decisions , of cost to the economy and other public issues can be properly debated . The authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as a result of the tests refers only to mass statistics where other death risks for the population play a role . It says absolutely nothing about the individual 's decision to get more information through PSA tests . <p> ROBERT H. POWSNER <p> Point Reyes Station <p> . <p> CIVIL CRITICAL MASS <p> Editor  --  Why is Willie Brown so outraged by the Critical Mass bike ride ( Chronicle , July 3 ) ? The June 27 ride was one of the most tame , organized , regulated and genuinely civil Critical Mass events I 've participated in  --  the police escorts kept riders off sidewalks , out of center medians , confined to one side of the roadway and held up the pack several times at heavy traffic intersections . <p> Hardly the radical , revolutionary , law-breaking mob scene that the mayor suggests . Now the stuffy San Francisco set and all those inconvenienced non-resident car commuters have followed suit and are up in arms about " those bicyclists . " Hey , bike riding is not a crime ! And Critical Mass is a chance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity . Trying to put the brakes on this growing movement will lead to more , not less , radical acts of defiance by miffed bike riders . Instead of complaining , the detractors should come out one Friday evening a month and join in the fun . <p> PETER COHEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> STALLED IN TRANSIT <p> Editor  --  Amid the escalating " discussion " about Critical Mass , there seems to be one element of the commuting public that has not been taken into account : those of us who use public transportation . <p> I recall sitting on a streetcar a few months back while the cyclists closed down Market Street for over 20 minutes . I watched as one public transportation vehicle after another backed up and realized that for the rest of the evening people along every bus line that originates on Market Street were going to be doing a lot of waiting . I wondered : What lesson was Critical Mass trying to teach us ? <p> RICHARD JOHNSON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> CHILDRENS ' PLIGHT <p> Editor  --  If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a society that treats dying pets more humanely than dying patients , she should consider the plight of children consigned to parents so incompetent that no pound would trust them with any of its animals . At least most dying patients are not as helpless as those kids , but in both situations the dogs get more consideration . A civilized society would treat people at least as well . <p> KAREN KRIETE <p> San Francisco
