My father is telling me about Victoria again . I smile , nod , remind him I am a journalist and that I can not just sit down and write a book about Victoria because he is sure it will make a best seller , full of romance , intrigue , and heartbreak . <p> " It 's rags to riches to rags again ! " my father says , not listening to me . " A story you wo n't be able to put down ! " <p> " You 've told me . " <p> " What happened to her would be no big deal today , but back then , who did such things ? She was a bohemian ! And beautiful , everyone says so . It 's a tragedy ! And do n't forget the love story here , Adam . The composer . At that time he was nobody . That anybody should know he would become Mr. Hollywood , least of all Victoria ! The two of them were bohemians ! In Atlantic City they 'd take a room together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows and the dances and the burlesque houses , and the liquor they drank .. , all without care what people thought ! They believed in free love . Okay , so maybe it 's not front-page news now  --  " <p> " Please , Dad , " I say . " Can we get on with this ? " I am helping my father move into an apartment outside Philadelphia a few miles from the house he has lived in for thirty-seven years . My mother died last year , and although he did n't want to move , the place has become much too big for him . " I forget things . I 'll come home from shopping and leave the groceries in the car and then I 'll look out the window later and see the trunk open and remember that 's where the groceries are and I have n't finished taking them in . " He told me this over the phone , long distance to Tucson where I work for The Arizona Daily Star . " Maybe if I had a smaller place I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening I 'd been waiting for . " I 'll help you move , " I said . After our mother died , my sister and I had begged him to find a place he could manage but he would n't consider it at the time . " Where will you find a view like this ? " he said , pointing to the park across the street . <p> But in thirty-seven years the house is as old as I am , my parents moving in two weeks before I was born the area has deteriorated . Next door , on what used to be the spacious front yard of an older home , three small bungalows have been squeezed together , only eight feet apart , the minimum allowed by code . And the park , neglected over the years , has litter clinging to the backstop of the baseball diamond where I once charged around the bases and dove headfirst into home , winding up in the hospital with a broken collarbone ( I was safe ) . The once stately oak trees at the park 's entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too many unpruned branches broken and dead from storms , swinging loose in the wind like discarded canes . On weekends and holidays , teenagers wash and wax their cars on the grass , letting the soapy water run into our driveway . My father sees none of this , just his preserved view of many years ago : my sister and I on skis about to descend the mild incline of the park 's snowy hill toward a frozen stream that now has soft drink cups and hubcaps floating in it . <p> " A beautiful woman once , even your mother admitted as much . Gorgeous red hair and a figure that made history . Like a goddess she walked around . Yet innocent . She knew nothing . A schoolteacher , she wanted to be when I met her . No wonder he fell for her . " <p> " Who ? " I say . My father has a habit of referring to everyone as " he " or " she , " a problem worsened by age . <p> " The composer , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody back then , a few minor songs he wrote . Victoria showed them to me . Believe me , my own were better . " <p> Today the composer is a famous man , an Oscar winner for his movie themes . This is the " love interest " my father wants me to include . My father sees it all , the innocent girl from Philadelphia , the New York composer ( unknown and struggling at the time ) falling in love on the boardwalk , Victoria 's subsequent initiation into decadent Manhattan society , their torrid ten-year affair , the terrible fights , his jilting her after she is hooked on drugs , her acting career ending in nude photos for girlie magazines , the simultaneous meteoric rise of the composer ( " True to life , " my father says , " the S.O.B . gets what he 's after ! " ) , the eventual end of Victoria in an institution where she leads a reclusive life for the next thirty years . <p> " I 'm telling you , " my father says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't take an hour a day to work on an idea that will bring you millions ? " <p> I wrap the wineglasses in newspaper and put them in the box . My father is holding up a decanter that I remember us using only once  --  the night my parents had an engagement dinner for my sister and her husband , who live in Seattle now . Before my mother died , my parents had bickered constantly . Whatever anger was buried during our childhood surfaced in those later years after my sister and I moved away from home . My father , insisting my mother not work ( she 'd been an office manager in a Manhattan bookkeeping firm ) , had taken her away from her five sisters in New York to Philadelphia , where he wanted to settle after the war . Her lifelong struggle with agoraphobia grew worse here and frustrated them both , and near the end of her life she was afraid to leave the house at all for fear of ... well , anything from crime to not having a bathroom nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her diabetes and the drugs she took for her high blood pressure . My father retired in order to take care of her ( he would n't put her in a nursing home ) , helping her to the bathroom , getting her meals , doing all the shopping , making the beds , keeping the house clean . My mother did n't want a maid . The house had been her whole life and the idea of turning it over to someone else was an unacceptable loss of power . One minute she would yell at my father that he was overworking himself , the next she would complain he did n't do things right : the way she 'd done them when she 'd been able to get around . Nearly blind and barely able to walk , she nevertheless followed after him , criticizing him for the way he loaded the dishwasher , wiped down a table , threw in the laundry without sorting it first , left the butter out , put away silverware .... " Whoever heard of keeping silverware in a second drawer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyson 's chicken again , " or " Why did n't you get that Tyson 's chicken we always eat ? " My sister and I pleaded with my father to just bring someone in , what was More going to do ? Stop the person from cleaning ? He was n't young himself , seventy-two years old . But he would n't hear of it . " She 'll pull out of this , " he 'd say , blind to my mother 's condition , desperate to deny anything was really wrong . " She 's just venting , " he 'd say . " It does n't bother me . She puts up with my craziness and I put up with hers . We 've been doing it for forty years . That 's what love is , " and he 'd go back to buying the wrong kind of mayonnaise or running the dryer on high or ironing a blouse that she hated to wear , a thousand little stubbornnesses they assaulted each other with every day . I think it would have gone on like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and silent to protest , paralyzed , unable to raise even a finger to scold him . He brought in a housekeeper then , a victory for neither of them . <p> Now , my first time home since the funeral , my father and I have n't spoken once about my mother 's death , how frightening and horrible it was to watch her decline . Instead , he talks only about Victoria . " I never touched her , Adam . She would call and say , ' Newman , I 'm lonely . Why do n't you ever come see me ? I 'm by myself here tonight . ' " <p> " So why did n't you go ? " <p> " Go ? To see her ? I was a married man by then ! " <p> " But before that , when she was the bohemian on the boardwalk or whatever did n't you even date her ? " I ca n't believe I 've gotten suckered into this discussion . <p> " Of course I dated her but I never touched her ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell me . ' I 've never met such a nice man , ' she 'd say . I gave her music lessons , every Thursday at four P.M. I taught her the piano , boogie-woogie . She wanted to be a jazz singer for a while . I brought her home to meet my mother and father and brothers ! Did they like her ? <p> " I shrug . " Did they ? " <p> " Of course they liked her ! Everyone did ! She was a beauty ! Hair down to there . " My father motions somewhere with his hand , the basement or hell . I do n't know . I 'm losing track of the day and the conversation . In a week I have to be back at work , and Marti , my wife , is seven months pregnant with our first child . It 's not a time I particularly want to leave her alone . " Dad , can we talk about Victoria tomorrow ? I think we should concentrate on packing . You just have to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm telling you , this is an idea you can count on a hundred percent . You make a little outline and send it off . I guarantee you 'll get fifty offers . " <p> " It does n't work like that . So let 's forget about the book- " " A blockbuster ! We 're talking wide audience appeal . The younger people will understand the bohemian side , the rebellion . Him  --  " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Her father . He was a stiffened Prussian who could spit cold water on you , icicles . You see what I 'm talking about here ? She rebelled against him . He was this main influence on her life and she ran away from her family to be with him  --  " <p> " Who ? " <p> " The composer ! That 's the part the kids can relate to . I 've got notes to show you . " <p> " No , please . I do n't need to see them . I can imagine it if I ever want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do it , then ? " <p> " Let me sleep on it , Dad , " I say , just to calm him down . <p> " She 'd have hold of my arm as we walked down the aisle of the Robin Hood Dell to our concert seats . I do n't exaggerate , thirty heads would turn . " <p> " Why did n't you marry her ? " <p> " Him , " he says . I throw up my hands . " Who , Dad ? Ca n't you use names ? " <p> " I 'm sorry . The composer . She fell in love with him while we were going out . One day I went over there to take her out to Fairmount Park and there was a note on the door : she had to see me that day-urgent . I called her all day , all evening , late into the night . I could n't close my eyes without being frightened what had happened to her . The next day I call and she tells me she thinks we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry this young songwriter . " <p> " The composer . " <p> " Right . But at the time , I 'm also writing songs , so I feel doubly bad , not only has she thrown me over for another guy , but he 's a songwriter , too . " <p> " So then you met Mom . " <p> " Many years later . I was a different man then . In my thirties . " <p> " You carried a torch for Victoria all that time ? " <p> " Sure , what 's ten years when you know someone like her ? " <p> I shrug . My father says , " Tomorrow we 'll go see her . I have n't spoken to her in twenty-five years but I think I 'm ready now . You 'll go with me and take pen and paper , right ? It 's all settled . " <p> " No , Dad , " I say . " Ab-so-lute-ly not . " <p> Victoria , Bohemian of the Boardwalk . <p> This is the title my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . We are driving down Route 95 , on our way to Wilmington , Delaware , where Victoria lives in a nursing home . <p> " Dad , you do n't just drop in on someone you have n't seen for twenty-five years . " <p> " Why not ? " he says . " Wo n't she be surprised . " <p> Victoria 's brother , who owns an appliance store in South Philadelphia , has given us the address . Early this morning my father called him and said we wanted to visit Victoria . I was writing a book about Victoria 's life . I heard all this as I was coming down the stairs , with sleep in my eyes , my mouth dry , aware that we hardly accomplished anything together yesterday . All night I 'd been up packing , while my father slept on the couch . " Just going to take a little five-minute snooze , " he said , and he was out for the rest of the evening . <p> We pull up in front of the nursing home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the lobby several people in wheelchairs and bathrobes watch television . There is a chalkboard with a list of such activities as YWCA aerobics , Health Awareness Check , and Creative Cake Decorating . <p> Someone calls to my father . " Mr. Holzman , how you doing ? " It is Moses Rudolf . I have n't seen him in over fifteen years . " Moses , " my father says , " I had no idea you were here . " Moses is in a wheelchair , one of his legs gone . He sees us staring down . <p> " Blood clots , " he says . " Been quite a while now . How you all doing ? " He extends his palm fiat out for us to shake hands . I look down at his black hand with the same amazement I did as a child . Moses worked for my father in the jewelry store in Philadelphia before my father retired . When my father would go out to lunch , I 'd stay behind with Moses and watch the store . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers could bend back at the knuckles , his elbow reversed too so that he could stroke the long skull of his head with his fingers as if it were another person 's hand . It was both exciting and repelling , especially since he 'd put opal rings from the showcase on his fingers to do it . <p> I take Moses ' hand in mine and shake it . His hand is warm and I can almost feel the opal rings pressing into my own palm . His hair , which used to be tight black curls , lending him a sinuous invincibility , now is thin and white and ! can see the pinkish brown skin underneath . It occurs to me that he is at least ten years younger than my father , who with his blue knit golf shirt and tan arms from working in the garden looks like a picture of youth next to Moses . <p> " So what you all doing here ? " Moses says . " I guess you all did n't come by just to see me or my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a while , " Moses says . " I 'm used to it by now . " I try to picture Moses  --  the double-jointed arms and elbows of his legless torso bent back and stroking his head preciously . It is a frightening yet enthralling image of roving , serpentine arms , like a Hindu god , and has the same power to make me stare dumbly at him as I did years ago . " You retired yourself , am I right ? " Moses says to my father . <p> " Ten years now , " my father says . " I was ready to leave . " He spreads his hands out , as if to contemplate a globe while he speaks . " Comes a stage when you have to consider making changes . Life 's too short to spend so much time in one place . " <p> " Here today , gone today , " Moses says . " How 's the wife doing ? " <p> " She 's dead , a year now . " <p> " Sorry to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " To be honest , it was a blessing for her . Very sick . Great pain <p> for her . " <p> Nobody says anything for a few moments , then Moses asks , " How about you , Adam ? What you doing now ? " <p> " He 's doing terrific , " my father says before I can answer . " A big reporter out in Arizona . " My father bends over and taps Moses on the shoulder with a stiff finger , speaking in a stage whisper . " He broke that Mafia story on the Galosi family in Tucson . You read about it , right ? " <p> Moses shakes his head . " I just keep up with the sports . " <p> " We 're going to have a baby , " I say , trying to add something I care about . The Galosi family turned out to be nothing in the end , dismissed at the grand jury level for lack of evidence . My father forgets to add this , as he does anything that might diminish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in law school he liked to tell everyone I had an internship lined up as a law clerk with the Supreme Court . " I only inquired about one , " I told him the summer after I dropped out . <p> " Well , congratulations to you , Adam . You gon na make a fine daddy . " <p> " Yes ? " I say , and wonder about this , why his casual compliment strikes me with such force , and then I realize it 's because my father has never said anything so simple and easy as this to me . " Thanks , " I say softly . <p> " He 's writing a terrific book about her . " <p> I wince . As would be expected , Moses looks completely puzzled . <p> " We 're here for someone named Victoria , " I say . <p> " Schmidt , " my father adds to my surprise . " You know her , Moses ? " <p> Moses shakes his head . " Ca n't say I do . " A bell rings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " We should find her , Dad , " I say . " Ask at the desk about her . " <p> " Moses , " my father says , " I know where you are now . " <p> " You know where I am , " Moses says . " Do n't be no stranger . " <p> " You can see the woman she used to be , right ? I mean for the book you could use your imagination now that you met her . " <p> I do n't say anything . I 'm driving back . It was obvious once we left the nursing home , with his shortness of breath and hands trembling as he searched himself for his keys , that he 'd been too shaken by the experience to drive . Near the Pennsylvania state line , we have traveled almost twenty miles from the Golden Meadows Care Center in uncomfortable silence . The farther we drive from the county nursing home , from the real Victoria , the more I can feel my father getting back his confidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . She was n't up to it today . Delightful . Like a little arpeggio . " My father raises an imaginary flute to his mouth and plays  --  fanciful , silly tones that sound as if he 's inhaled helium . " I used to live for that laugh . Once-a " <p> " Stop it , Dad . " <p> I pull off the interstate to a rest stop . <p> " You have to go ? Go ahead . Do your business . I 'll wait here . " <p> " Listen to me , " I say . I turn off the engine . He squirms in his seat . <p> " All right , maybe it was n't such a good idea . I warned you she might not be in such good shape . " <p> " Good shape ? She was pitiful . " <p> " Tragic , I told you , it 's a tragedy what happened  --  " <p> " It 's not a tragedy , it 's just pitiful . Did you look at her ? Did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria , sitting on a plastic chair in a corner of the recreation room , stating vacantly into space , her mouth and throat scarred by cancer , her hands clutched at her stomach as if to hold a warm stone there , her complete lack of response to my father 's pleading It 's Newman , Victoria , it 's Newman , his hand on her bony shoulder , the dull green fabric of her robe with its SAVE THE WHALES button that an attendant had pinned to a worn lapel . <p> " We 'll go visit her again while you ' re here . She may need time to feel comfortable with seeing me again . " <p> I shake my head . " Who exactly are we talking about ? Victoria ? " <p> " Sure , Victoria . " <p> " And you ca n't see how hopeless she is ? She did n't even know you were there ! " <p> My father gets out of the car at the rest stop . He goes over to a picnic table and sits down with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly planted spruce trees in back of him , staked down with guide wires . On a blanket in front of the trees a family sits eating lunch . A toddler industriously picks up paper cups and drops them in a cooler , takes out the cups and drops them in again . I feel a pang of loneliness for Marti , our unborn child , my own family ; it seems months since I 've been gone . <p> " I 've always been an optimist , " my father says . <p> " Listen to me . You ca n't just throw this fantasy into the pot and make everyone come out happy . <p> " My father does n't respond . <p> A truck pulls into the parking space in front of us , the whoosh of air brakes being released . <p> " Mother 's dead , " I say . " You never mention it . You never admit it . I ca n't get around that . I ca n't even help you move out until you acknowledge that in your heart grieve over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely stuck , and me too now . " <p> We are sitting beside each other like two old men on a park bench , all the time in the world , not a word from him . <p> " You do n't face things , " I say , driven now to force a reaction . " You wo n't even visit her grave with me . " <p> He remains mute . When I turn to him I see that his eyes are moist and my heart seizes . He pats my knee . " We wo n't talk about her anymore , " he says , leaving the pronoun eternally ambiguous . <p> That night my mother sits with me in a sewing room on the third floor , a floor that does n't exist in my parents ' house . A plaid blanket lies over her paralyzed legs , the same blanket my father covers himself with , summer or winter , when he sleeps on the couch . Why wo n't you come down ? I ask her . She has been up here a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no strain in her voice , none of the tenseness I remember as a child when she would tell my sister and me to go to our rooms and play because she was sick and needed to lie down . <p> I let her know the baby is fine , Marti too . Will you come down now ? Please ? <p> She pulls my father 's blanket tighter around her waist . <p> We need you . He needs you . <p> My mother lowers her head and parts her hair with her fingers , exposing the white roots . I look closely and discover a tiny gem , like the red dot Indian wives put on their foreheads , only this jewel is deep blue . I wonder how long it has been there , how it is embedded in the skin . <p> Does it hurt ? I ask . <p> My mother smiles at me . I will be disappointed when I wake up because she has not looked at me with such pleasure and curiosity in a long time . No , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> She laughs . All the fathers know , she says . <p> A week passes . I am still in Philadelphia trying to get my father moved . " He 's impossible , " I complain to Marti during one of our late-night phone calls . My father is asleep on the couch as usual . It is where he used to sleep when my mother was sick . He has never dropped the habit . <p> He has been to see Victoria every day since our first trip . His visits grow longer too , stretching out to three , four , and five hours . He tells me he is " making progress , " though I have no idea what this means because I refuse to go with him , staying behind instead to pack , angry at him for leaving me with this task knowing I have to be home myself . My editor has reluctantly given me another week 's extension , and Marti has become impatient , listening in cool silence while I try to explain how frustrated I am with his behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marti says . <p> " How do you mean ? " <p> " He can rely on you to take care of everything while he goes off and lives out this fantasy . " <p> " What am I going to do ? I have to get him out of here . The realtor is calling every day asking whether we 'll be ready by the closing to vacate the house . " <p> " Will you ? " <p> " I do n't know . We 'd better . It 's three hundred dollars a day penalty if we do n't . " <p> Silence . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I say . <p> " I just miss you , Adam . I feel as if you 've been sucked into this hole and you 're never going to get out . Your father will find a way to keep you there . " <p> " He knows I have to leave . If I could just get him away from Victoria . " <p> " It would n't matter . He 'll find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does n't want to be alone . " <p> " How are you doing ? " I say , wanting to change the subject . " Still being drop-kicked ? " <p> " Every night right at ten , just as I fall asleep  --  apparently baby does n't want to be alone either . " <p> " All tight , " I say , " I get the message . I 'll try to wrap things up here in a day or two and be home then . " <p> But the next day my father comes back from the nursing home and informs me he 's bringing Victoria to dinner tomorrow evening . He 'd like my help in preparing the meal . I 'm stunned . <p> " In the car , " he says , explaining how he 'll transport her here . Should n't it be obvious ? <p> " Dad , are you actually talking with her now ? " <p> " Of course I talk with her . " <p> " Does she talk back ? " <p> My father looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think-I go around talking to myself ? . " <p> " I ca n't believe it . I just ca n't believe this ! " I 've been stating at the dining-room table pads for the past half hour , wondering what to do with them , which of my three piles they belong in : the apartment pile , the storage pile , the trash pile . Unable to decide I put the pads in the " undecided " pile , which has grown exponentially as we near our deadline . We have three days left to pack before the new owners take possession of the house . I called my sister to ask for help , to fly out here from Seattle , but her vacation starts tomorrow and the whole family is leaving for Hawaii . " Why did n't you call earlier ? " she asked me . <p> I thought I could do it myself . I wanted to . She had spent so much time here when our mother had a stroke that I felt this was my contribution , helping Dad out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my sister said last night . " They 'll put everything in boxes and get it on the truck . " But it 's too late for that now and I would feel even more ashamed of my failure to accomplish this task than I already do if strangers traipsed in the door and began packing all our belongings . Also I 've gotten sidetracked by mulling over my own past , high-school yearbooks , honor roll certificates , desperate letters to adolescent girlfriends whose faces in memory blur into a composite not unlike the youthful , fiery Victoria laughing in the salted sea air of the boardwalk . <p> " You need to help me pack , Dad . I 'm sorry , but you 're going to have to postpone the dinner . " <p> " I ca n't , " he says . " It 's our anniversary . " <p> " Your anniversary ? Of what ? " <p> " When we first became engaged .

She said he was all wrong for her-no respect , no security , no future . Later I learned he 'd taken up with somebody else and that 's what she was so upset about , but at the time all I heard was she wanted to marry me . She begged me . I had all the stability the composer could n't give her , a pretty good business over on Samson Street . It was right after the war and I was selling diamonds like postage stamps . I could n't keep enough in stock  --  " <p> " Wait a second . After the war  --  you were already with Mom , were n't you ? " <p> My father stands at the refrigerator eating what 's left of the rice pudding . He keeps his back to me . " We were engaged too . " <p> " Too ! You were engaged to both Morn and Victoria at the same time ? " <p> " Yes . That same day Victoria called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this ? " <p> My father nods . He puts the lid back on the rice pudding and pushes it far back onto the shelf filled with the leftover take-out food we 've been eating every night . He refuses to look at me during this exchange , wo n't move from behind the refrigerator door . <p> " In other words you broke off the engagement with Mother ? " <p> " It was a bad thing . Very serious . " <p> " I 'll say . " <p> " She should n't have taken me back . " <p> " Mother ? " <p> " She should n't have taken me back . Or she should have forgiven me . To be married all those years and never forgiven . She 's also to blame . " He closes the refrigerator door . Rice pudding has stuck to his chin . I reflexively touch my own face , so much the image of his , reversed only in its shock , where his shows resignation .

" <p> " Dad  --  " <p> His eyes close on the couch . In seconds he 's asleep . <p> " More wine ? " my father says to Victoria . <p> We are sitting at the dining room table , surrounded by boxes stacked up to the ceiling . <p> Victoria raises one finger . My father smiles and fills her glass to the rim with the wine , a white Bordeaux . <p> She wears a blue dress with a silver satin collar , a small white bow fastened with a cloth button the size of a kitten 's nose to each short sleeve , the elastic of which fails to grip her upper arm . A hairdresser who visits the nursing home every Thursday has coifed Victoria 's white hair , swept back and folded behind her head with what seems a generous amount of hairspray . Around her neck rests a pearl choker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He pretended to be making all the food himself in the kitchen . As far as I know Victoria believed him . <p> " Adam , would you do the honors ? " <p> My father sets the Black Forest cake in front of me with a knife . <p> " Excuse me , " he says . Victoria leans over to say something to him . She can not raise her voice above a whisper , the throat cancer . " Victoria says none for her . " She whispers again . " She wants to know why you did n't eat your veal .

She has moved in and out of being with us during dinner , speaking only twice , with great pain , once to say the food was excellent , the other time to inform us that at eleven P.M. she would be picked up by her mother ( who died twenty years ago ) . The staff at the nursing home made a big production about her going out . " She had four attendants dressing her ! " my father announced over dinner , his arm pawlike , hung like a large gourd over her tiny shoulder , squeezing wide-eyed looks from her as she sat mute and diminutive in all her aged smallness .

Meanwhile my father and I had had a tug of war over the dinner plates , his insisting he would wash and repack them , my demanding he use paper ones . <p> Now my father sits with Victoria in the living room while I clean up . I hear him talking to her , although I can not make out what he is saying . It sounds as if they are having an actual conversation , punctuated by laughter and teasing . I dump all the Styrofoam containers and paper cups in the trash , then wash the silverware and repack it . The movers will be here tomorrow and I am finally ready for them , having marked every box with the appropriate apartment room . The sense of accomplishment I feel from all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , I see my father sitting at the feet of Victoria , who , behind the wings of a floral chair , has only her legs visible to me in their navy hose . I can not see Victoria 's face , but I imagine her pale yellow eyes staring vacantly at my father , a dimly lit warmth retrieved from near hopeless depths . <p> " Victoria will be staying for breakfast , " he says . Victoria leans forward . Her expression conveys shyness and mild flirtation . The bows on her sleeves dance with mischief , her pearl choker a high marble wall to be surmounted for the pleasure of her throat , her exhausted body all things to all men . I do not see the hollow flesh , the dead cells , the bones so fragile they break like tiny glass tubes , the laying her out sacrificially on my mother 's bed . <p> I run upstairs and lock myself in his bedroom . I call Marti . <p> " He wants to sleep with her , " I hiss into the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> I can not believe how my heart has begun palpitating over this . " I ca n't allow this . " <p> " Victoria and your father ? " <p> " Yes , " I say . " Yes . It 's crazy . He 's crazy . He wants me to witness all this , make me an accomplice , prove to the world he 's finally captured her . This ultimate expression of his megalomania ! Are you there ? " <p> " I 'm here . " <p> " He ca n't do this . It 's against the law ! " <p> " He 's forcing her ? " <p> " Against the law of nature ! " <p> " Where are you now ? " <p> " Upstairs . I 've locked the bedroom door . " From down below I hear my father calling to me . <p> " Adam , you ca n't stop them . " <p> " Marti , this is my father we 're talking about . He 's about to defile this poor woman . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home the last twenty years ! She does n't even know what 's happening to her ! She ca n't take care of herself . It 's cruelty . " <p> " Does he love her ? " <p> " What 's that have to do with it ? " <p> " Does he ? " <p> " Marti , the question is utterly inappropriate here . " <p> " Is it ? " <p> Neither of us speak for a while . I play with the switch at the base of the nightstand lamp , an antique , the one item I 've left unpacked because I want to take it back with me . I consider knocking the whole thing over , the delirious sound the brass shade will make . Marti says , " All right then , are you coming home tomorrow like you promised ? " <p> " Do you realize the situation that 's developed here tonight ? I ca n't just let him destroy her like this . He has no compunction , no awareness of what he 's doing . It will kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " <p> " I want you back . It 's starting to frighten me . " <p> I put the phone against my shoulder . Downstairs I hear music . The piano . A brassy tune marches up the stairs , twirls and descends again . <p> " I want to know something , " Marti says . A high C pings over and over like a knife tapping crystal . A music lesson ? " Are you going to be the same kind of father as him ? " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " Never around . Never here for your child . " <p> " Of course not , " I say , but I feel a shiver go through my body . <p> " Because if you are ... " Marti starts to cry . " Because if you are I want to know about it now . I have to know . " <p> I think about Marti 's parents , divorced after thirty years , her mother saying to us on a visit from California , " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell asleep for thirty years . I lived with a stranger all that time . " <p> " We 're going to be fine , " I say . <p> " Do n't tell me that . It 's not true . And you ca n't promise me , anyway . You 're not even here now . This was supposed to be our last vacation before the baby came . " <p> " I did n't have a choice , Marti . " <p> " Why did you wait until I was too pregnant to fly before you went ? Were you trying to get away from us ? Is it that you 're scared of being a father ? I do n't know what to think , Adam . Help me . " <p> " Marti , look , " I say , but do n't finish because I 'm not sure what it is I want her to see . That I 've pleased no one by coming here ? That my father married the wrong woman ? That my mother died trying to find love in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsession , is about to fuck the lights out of the dead , rotting past ? <p> " I 'll be home tomorrow . Promise . " <p> " But do you want to come home ? " <p> " Are you kidding ? " <p> " I want to hear you say it , Adam . " <p> " I want to come home . I want to see you . I love you . " <p> " You love our baby ? " <p> " I 'm crazy about our baby . " <p> " How do I know ? Ca n't you tell me something that will make me believe you ? " <p> I 'm lost . <p> " Adam ? " <p> " I 'm yours , " I say , simple enough . " That 's what love is . " I shake my head , unable to believe I 'm quoting my father . " I 'm yours . " <p> I sit for a moment after I get off the phone , my hands on my knees . When I go downstairs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song I know from childhood , the words about a young man who pulls the moon along on a string so the tide will rush out and he can dance at the bottom of the sea with his lover . On the couch , with her arms at her sides , is Victoria , and for a moment I think she is dead . My father gets up from the bench and goes over to her . His lips touch her ravaged cheek , caress the back of her neck , move up to the bony protrusion at the base of her skull . I see the brain stem quiver with life under their warmth . He strokes her hair , then looks up at me and tells me with his eyes to mourn us all . <p> <p> By Steven Schwartz <p>
