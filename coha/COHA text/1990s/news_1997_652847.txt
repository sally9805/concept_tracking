<p> The traditional family film , once a lucrative staple of Hollywood 's studio system , is quietly dying as the industry feeds an increasingly restless audience with bigger stars , more provocative themes and stories with an edge unheard of even a decade ago . <p> With the failure of numerous family and animated films over the last year  --  and with Disney 's animated movie " Hercules " a relative disappointment at the box office this summer  --  studio executives acknowledged that the film industry is , in many ways , lagging behind the tastes of children and their parents , whose appetite for more sophisticated and even violent movies has surprised even Hollywood . <p> Influences that are commonly cited include television sitcoms , which increasingly deal with sex and adult issues ; hip shows and animation for youngsters on Nickelodeon , other cable stations and Fox ( " The Simpsons " and " King of the Hill " ) ; the growth of the Internet and use of computers at home , and , perhaps most important , the breakup of many traditional families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends have led to a blurring of pop culture tastes among baby boomer parents and their children . <p> " The audience is nothing more than the culture , so when 5-year-olds are watching the Rover on Mars they 're not going to be equally interested in a little movie about a raccoon looking for a snail : it 's no longer an innocent period of time , " said David Vogel , president of Walt Disney Pictures , the family division of the studio . <p> Chris Pula , president for marketing at Warner Brothers , said the overlap between children 's tastes and adult tastes these days was startling . " Children are the only demographic that aspires older , " he said . " They were raised on the computer and they want the same explosions , special effects , originality and edginess as adults . They know when a movie panders to them . Kids , even small kids , attack each choice with a level of sophistication and cynicism I 've never seen before . " <p> In some ways the proliferation of big-budget action films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many traditional family films failed , perhaps partly because their plots and sensibilities seemed tired or just unappealing . These films included " A Simple Wish , " the animated feature " Cats Do n't Dance , " " Wild America , " " Turbo : A Power Rangers Movie , " " Buddy , " " Gone Fishin " ' and " McHale 's Navy . " The summer 's two biggest hits , " The Lost World : Jurassic Park " and " Men in Black , " as well as " Batman and Robin , " drew huge children 's audiences even though the movies , which had moments of violence , had ratings of PG-13 , or " Parents strongly cautioned , " a warning that the film may not be suitable for anyone under 13 . The sophisticated comedy hit " My Best Friend 's Wedding , " in which Julia Roberts plays a woman who wants to break up her male friend 's wedding , tapped into an unexpected audience . <p> " Among 10-year-old girls , even 8-year-old girls , this film keeps building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sony Pictures Entertainment . " The film seems more competitively appealing than some of the more overt family movies . " Besides Ms. Roberts , who is popular among girls , stars like Jim Carrey , Robin Williams and now Will Smith have big followings among boys . Action Movies Bridge a Gap <p> Even more surprising for many studio executives is the fact that even a highly violent film like John Woo 's " Face/Off , " with an R rating ( " Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian " ) , seems to be drawing audiences of young boys who have implored their fathers to see it . The decline in the traditional family G-rated film , for " general " audiences , probably began in 1981 with the release of the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas blockbuster , " Raiders of the Lost Ark . " Whether by accident or design , the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children . Before that , the makers of action movies had more or less aimed for an adult audience . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family films in America , " said Joe Roth , chairman of Walt Disney Studios . " Having an action film that appealed to children created an entirely different and new environment for parents to choose movies to take their kids . " <p> Nowadays every studio in town seeks to soften the language and , if possible , quell the violence in action films to make them PG-13 as opposed to R. One of last year 's unexpected hits , " Congo , " based on the Michael Crichton book , was poorly received by critics but grossed more than $80 million because of its appeal to boys and its PG-13 rating . <p> On another level the shifting family audience for movies seems to underscore more profound changes in the nation 's pop culture tastes and the way baby boomer parents of the 1990 's relate to their children . " We grew up in a youth culture : we 're youth-oriented and we still think we 're hip and young , " said Buffy Shutt , president for marketing at Universal Pictures . " Parents and kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same pop culture meeting grounds . My parents would n't think of watching Elvis or the Grateful Dead with me . That would n't happen now . " <p> Mr. Vogel , the Disney executive , said : " Today 's 8-year-olds are yesterday 's 12-year-olds . They watch some very edgy programs on television . There is n't this innocence of childhood among many children , what with broken homes and violence . We ca n't treat children as if they 're all living in tract homes of the 1950 's and everyone is happy . That is ridiculous . " <p> A result is to try to make movies that are more sophisticated and not simply palatable for adults but enjoyable . One of last year 's unexpected hits was " Babe , " a disarming fantasy about a pig who wants be a sheepdog . The film , which grossed over $64 million , was so inventive that adults turned out in large numbers even without children . <p> Brian Henson , president of the Jim Henson Company , which produces a steady stream of family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family film was an effort to make movies that adults want to see as well . " Actually parents say one thing and do something altogether different , " he said . " They say , ' We do n't like violence in a film for our kids , ' but then they wo n't see a film because they feel it 's too soft : there 's no action . " <p> " There 's really no such thing as a children 's movie , " Mr. Henson added . " Children go to movies with grown-ups , and if a grown-up is going to spend two hours in a theater he or she wants to enjoy the movie too . That 's the lesson we keep learning over and over again . Parents want to be entertained and kids want to see something for grown-ups too . " <p> Mr. Henson said the failure of his company 's recent film " Buddy , " in which Rene Russo plays a woman who brings up an ape , taught him some lessons . " It was a little too soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " And what we learned is that family films have got to work for boys and men . I do n't know why that 's true . But you need that boy audience . " Boys Rejecting Girls as Heroines <p> Other studio executives agreed , saying that the unspoken rule in Hollywood is that a film with a girl as a heroine will not lure boys into theaters . But a movie with a boy or young man as hero , like Macaulay Culkin in " Home Alone " or Brendan Fraser in " George of the Jungle , " which has grossed $23 million since it opened Wednesday , will draw girls as well as boys . Even such critically acclaimed recent movies as " A Little Princess " and " Fly Away Home " were box office disappointments because their heroines were young girls and boys failed to show up . <p> The effort to broaden the appeal of traditional family films has even extended into animation . The first animated musical by Dreamworks , " Prince of Egypt , " the story of Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not the traditional G rating previously carried on all such movies . Trailers for the movie will be shown with Mr. Spielberg 's " Amistad , " a drama about a slave uprising to be released in December . What Dreamworks is bluntly telling audiences is that the animated movie is for grown-ups too . <p> Similarly , 20th Century Fox , taking a leaf from Disney 's " Beauty and the Beast , " is releasing " Anastasia , " an animated film about the Russian princess , with an eye on adults . " From the very beginning of our development of this movie the mandate we gave ourselves was this : tell this story on an adult level as opposed to in any way talking down to kids , " said Chris Meledandri , president of Fox Family Films . <p> " It 's not as if we 're geniuses , " he added . " We asked ourselves , ' What movie would we want to see ? ' " <p> The increasing financial risks of making animated films is to many studio executives symptomatic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune with such animated movies as " Aladdin " in 1991 ( grossing $217 million in the United States ) and " The Lion King " in 1994 ( $313 million ) , other studios entered the fray . The results were more animated flops ( " Ferngully : The Last Rain Forest " " Thumbelina , " " Once Upon a Forest , " " The Pagemaster , " " Balto " ) than successes . Even Disney has seen an erosion of its audiences for such animated films as " Pocahontas , " " The Hunchback of Notre Dame " and now " Hercules . " Overseas , however , Disney 's animated films are lucrative , and so are the video sales . <p> What complicates problems for Disney , Dreamworks and the other studios engaged in the expensive process of making animated films is that these movies take at least four or five years to create , and in that time pop culture and tastes shift , especially among youngsters . <p> " Hipness is important , and so is being stylish and sophisticated from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Nickelodeon Movies , an offshoot of the highly successful cable channel for children . " There 's no formula . The world is more sophisticated today . Our lives were so much simpler . And kids are demanding shows that express who they are and what they want . " The company 's forthcoming films include " Good Burger , " opening on Friday , a buddy comedy about two offbeat high school students based on a popular sketch from the Nickelodeon variety show " All That . " <p> Jean MacCurdy , the Warner Brothers president for television animation , put it bluntly . " You have to keep pushing the envelope toward more sophisticated humor and storytelling , " she said . " The biggest mistake is talking down to the audience . You ca n't do that . Besides , we want adults to sit down and enjoy our programs too . "
