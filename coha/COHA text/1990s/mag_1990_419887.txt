<p> Working from detailed drawings and photographs , Frederick Brosen creates a personal and tranquil view of the city . <p> The setting sun creates a geometric pattern of light and shadow along the length of the broad street . Of traditional red brick and white stone , the stately structures line both sides of the boulevard and lead the eye directly into the dark green trees of the city park situated at the block 's end . It is the painting Teachers ' College , and with it Frederick Brosen has taken you to visit another place near his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . <p> Brosen was born and raised only a few blocks from where he lives now . Except for a brief residence in Brooklyn , while getting his M.F.A. degree at Pratt Institute , he has lived in New York City 's most famous borough all his life . The parks , the monuments , the branching streets , and the multitude of buildings at the center of this huge metropolitan area make up the exciting neighborhood he calls home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees it perhaps as only a native can . <p> " Art works when it affects the way the viewer sees the world , " Brosen says . " My world happens to be Manhattan . Growing up here , I spent much of my time walking through its neighborhoods and parks . In a way , these neighborhoods are symbolic of the people who live in them . When at this fascinating I what I see is the buildings , and through them , a history people who 've lived in them , their moment in time . " <p> After several shows York City Schmidt-Bingham Gallery , Brosen find his landscape watercolors are reaching an ever-growing audience . However , he did not begin as a landscape artist , or even as a realist or a watercolorist . " Until my last year at Pratt , " Brosen says , " my work was a mixture of styles and methods oafs , but consisted primarily of surrealistic oil paintings and etchings of imaginary interiors . I was working directly out of my head , without models . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , so I began to work from life . <p> " I carried a sketchbook with me everywhere and really dug into it , " he continues . " It was time to put myself on the line , so I decided to do a painting of my favorite subject  --  New York City . All of a sudden , I felt as if I had just found myself . All those questions I had been asking myself  --  what do I paint and why  --  were answered . I had found my direction . " <p> Brosen was still in his early teens when he realized that he wanted to spend his life working in the visual arts . He applied and was accepted into New York City 's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art . Beginning in the tenth grade , he took three classes a day and was able to experience most forms of painting , sculpture , and printmaking before beginning college . Even now , years later and after much additional training , Brosen believes the opportunities and encouragement he received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . <p> His university art education began at The City College of New York . Brosen found that few of his fellow students were intent on making art their profession . " I received a lot of personal attention because the instructors knew I was serious about pursuing painting , " Brosen recalls . He also remembers getting excellent instruction in the technical aspects of painting . " You ca n't teach someone ideas , but you can say , ' Try this brush , or experiment with this paper to get this effect . ' <p> " When I went to Pratt Institute , the students were primarily interested in abstract art , " he continues . " At critiques , some would say , ' I ca n't believe you paint what you paint . Has n't the twentieth century happened for you ? ' But I believe there is both great realist art and great abstract art . There are no good or bad styles in painting  --  only good and bad artists . What is important is what a painting is saying  --  whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strict representational painting of my subjects but to successfully communicate my feelings about a scene through the painting . " <p> Brosen 's paintings are rendered to look like reality , but that reality has been subtly changed  --  simplified , patterned , and balanced  --  to make it into art . Each architectural detail or clump of trees is seen in complete detail as if viewed through a perfectly clear atmosphere . The scenes are cleansed of most billboards , grafitti , grime , and trash , and they are painted in clean , rich colors . There is little movement ; in Brosen 's vision , the city is peaceful , still , and quiet , and few , if any , people are to be seen . The buildings and the monuments , the streets and the details are serene and beautiful . <p> It usually takes several months of careful drawing and painting for Brosen to create one of his large watercolors . Because of the significant time investment , he chooses his subjects with care . Brosen must feel both a compelling in the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love , " he says . " My paintings reflect only my deepest responses to what I see . I 'll often walk by a place dozens of times before I 'll even consider painting it . " <p> On an extended visit to Europe in 1987 , Brosen refined his process of selecting a subject when he spent several weeks exploring the cityscapes of Paris and Amsterdam . " I visited only two cities , but I came to know them in depth , " he says . " Pictorially , it is easy to get lazy , and being in Europe provided a new challenge . There I was , painting structures that had not only been painted hundreds of times before , but were familiar to much of the public through photographs and paintings . This meant that I had to discover  --  and then evolve  --  a personal viewpoint . I had to use imagination and willpower to make something of my own out of what was already so well-known . " <p> When a site became familiar , Brosen would complete an on-site watercolor study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The painting sites I chose were frequently in the vicinity of my hotel , " he recalls . " They were views I saw repeatedly , and so I had the opportunity to develop a profound response toward them . " <p> Once the subject for a full-size painting is selected , Brosen will work from photographs to obtain a vantage point and time of day ; he will utilize the on-site watercolor study for his selections of color and light . Sometimes several photographs will be combined to create a slightly different perspective , as was the case with the painting Gansevoort Street . Brosen then overlays a grid pattern on the photographs in order to aid in his transferring the image onto the watercolor sheet . " I could save time by projecting the image onto the paper , but I fear I would lose the quality of the hand-created line , " Brosen says . " Grids are simple and direct . They give me an instant approximation of relationships and I can place the major shapes quickly . " <p> Brosen works on oversized 40 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold-pressed paper , which is soaked in the bathtub for half an hour , then laid flat and blotted . Immediately thereafter , the paper is placed on Brosen 's large drawing table , stretched , and held in place with gummed tape and staples . Before beginning to paint , Brosen makes an accurate and detailed drawing of the subject directly on the stretched watercolor sheet . " The pencil drawing is the rational part of my work , " he says . " It is here that I develop the composition and the spatial relationships . I consciously decide what to include and what to leave out of the painting . Drawing is primarily a process of elimination and simplification . " <p> For example , in Gansevoort Street , Brosen not only changed and simplified the perspective of the intersecting streets , but he eliminated most of the vehicles and a particularly intrusive parking sign . The tree behind the center building bears lush green leaves , rather than the bare branches seen in the photograph . " As I work , I am conscious of the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pattern I am creasing with the composition , " Brosen comments . " In Gansevoort Street , I deliberately placed the street lamp so that it would rest between the silhouettes of the buildings . " Brosen always paints the sky first . " It is the one place where a mistake can not be corrected , " he notes . The colors he uses in the sky are premixed to ensure an adequate supply . Then , using a large Chinese watercolor brush , Brosen quickly lays in his sky . He counts on having about half an hour to work before the paint sets completely . <p> To fix the drawing and to provide an overall undertone , the entire painting gets a thin , light wash that matches the base color used in the sky . In Gansevoort Street , where the bottom color is rose madder , the undertone is also rose madder . Traces of the color can still be seen in the lighter buildings and on the sidewalk . <p> When the underpainting is done , Brosen reinforces the drawing on the darker edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gray paint . From here on , he begins to paint throughout the piece , working steadily from the foreground into the background . To help achieve a transition back into space , Brosen will interrelate the color throughout the painting . To create an unclouded depth of color in the deepest shadows , he will often use twenty to twenty-five washes of paint . <p> Brosen works slowly carefully , meticulously . " I 've never seen the point in hurrying something through , " he points out . " Every area of the painting should be considered equally ; otherwise I 'm shortchanging the work . In watercolor , you have to live with your mistakes and hope not to make the same one the next painting . I see the evolution an in my work from year to year  --  an evolution I hope to continue . " <p> When he was younger , Brosen 's long-term goal was to have a solo show in a New York City gallery before his fortieth birthday . He was fortunate , for in 1983 , just before he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first solo exhibition at the Staempfli Gallery in New York City . In September of last year , he had his third solo Show  --  at the Schmidt-Bingham Gallery i New York City  --  and his next show is scheduled there for November 1991 . He has exhibited in solo and group shows elsewhere , including the National Academy of Design , the Brooklyn Museum , and the National Arts Club , all in New York City . Watercolors by Borsen are also included in many public , corporate , and private collections , among them those of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Hood Museum of Art in Hanover , New Hampshire . <p> " Exhibition opportunities happened more quickly than I anticipated , " Brosen says . " I was fortunate because I already knew what I wanted to paint and how I wanted to paint it . Now I concentrate on solving new problems and expanding into new directions  --  with , I hope , a healthy dose of enthusiasm . It seems that there is too much cynicism in a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a popular stance . In many works today , one notices a lack of connection between the artist 's feeling and his subject . To me , this connection is all-important . In the end , if a painting of mine in some small way alters someone 's perception of things around them , then I believe the work has accomplished its goal .
