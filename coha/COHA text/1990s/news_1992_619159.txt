<p> They grew up in the best of times . They grew up in a time of disillusionment . They were the most educated generation in history . They were the worst savers in history . They had birth control pills . They dropped acid . Yeah , yeah , yeah . <p> Their heroes were John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King . Their heroes were John Travolta and Johnny Rotten . They said , " Hell , no , we wo n't go . " They said , " Yo . " <p> Hey , hey , they 're the boomers , and people say a lot about them . <p> The baby boomers , the people born from 1946 to 1964 , are the most studied generation in history , although hardly the most interesting . It 's simply that there are so darn many of them ( one in every three Americans ) that if someone could just figure out who they are and what they 'll buy , that someone would get rich . They are the demographic El Dorado . <p> WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lawyer , sees himself as a typical boomer . <p> " What typified my generation was a commitment away from business toward social good . We thought we could make things better for everyone . I shared that whole Kennedy-era Weltanschauung . . . . A lot of us have lost sight of that in today 's business-driven world . What were we thinking of when we got MBAs ? " <p> Steve Clark , 30 , a Muni bus driver , says he is typical because he shares his generation 's lack of a sense of direction  --  but he is different because he is lucky enough to have a job . " A lot of my friends get up and say , ' Think I 'll go to the park and get some wine . ' " <p> See , the problem is : Which baby boomers are we talking about ? The 5 percent who fit the yuppie stereotype or the rest of the mob who can be subdivided on almost every question including perhaps : Where were you were the first time you heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 million- person brat pack is mainly divided into the Leading Edge and the Trailing Edge . <p> LEBS AND TREBS <p> Leading-Edge Baby Boomers ( let 's call them LEBs ) are those people born from 1946 to 1954 , who are today 38 to 46 . Their main concerns are keeping their job , paying the mortgage and raising the kids . <p> Trailing-Edge Baby Boomers ( TREBs ) , born from 1955 to 1964 , are 28 to 37 . Their main concerns are getting a job , finding a house and trying to decide whether to have children . <p> There are 33.8 million LEBs , compared with 41.9 million TREBs . <p> The ' 54- ' 55 dividing line is a somewhat arbitrary break point , although enough happened in those years to create a chasm between the LEBs and the TREBs. 1954 was the first year the majority of American households had televisions , meaning that the LEBs , by and large , spent their first years without a TV in the house , while the TREBs were nursed on the the tube . 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Elvis Presley , a transition from the more authoritarian first half-century to the more permissive second half . <p> Are you now , or have you ever been , nothin ' but a hound dog ? <p> 1955 was the year a polio vaccine was introduced , ending the epidemic that terrorized the childhood of LEBs . It was the year that the American auto industry was at its zenith with record sales ( and record holiday automobile deaths ) . And , not coincidentally , it was the year of the first major prolonged smog alert in Los Angeles , beginning an era of environmental destruction that has marked the youth of the TREBs . <p> The nightmare of disease that haunted the LEBs ' childhood ended with a triumph from science and technology . The nightmare of the dying planet that the TREBs were raised with continues unabated . <p> These are the days of miracle and wonder as well as the eve of destruction . <p> TYPICAL DIFFERENCES <p> Elliott Hahn , 43 , says he is a typical baby boomer , " You know , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pets . " And Gina Shield , 29 , says she is a typical baby boomer , " someone trying to find themselves in their late 20s . " <p> The more commonly acknowledged difference between the two groups , as described in a Population Bulletin issued last month , " The Baby Boom  --  Entering Midlife , " is this : <p> " The leading edge of the baby boom was at the vanguard of change , while the more numerous trailing edge was crowded behind . As they matured , the older baby boomers enjoyed the advantage of arriving first . Vying for the best jobs , these leading-edge boomers left little room for later job entrants . . . often younger brothers , sisters and cousins ( who ) endured split school-day sessions and faced tougher competition for college admissions . " <p> Little sister , do n't you weep . You were born too late , baby blue . <p> Quite simply the LEBs will always be in line ahead of the the TREBs . They got more education . They had more job interviews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And they will get something out of Social Security and Medicare before these programs go bankrupt during the " golden years " of the trailing edge . Products are being invented for the LEBs as they enter midlife ; by the time the TREBs notice that their abdomens are melting into their love handles , there probably wo n't be any Mini-Oreos left . <p> There are so many off-the-wall studies of this g-g-g-generation 's values  --  " research " that resembles Trivial Pursuit but indicates how much popular culture and advertising have controlled the life of baby boomers . In fact , most baby boomers can tell you everything you need to know about them , so immersed are they in boomerobilia . <p> EVERY VINTAGE <p> The People section randomly stopped baby boomers on the street until we had one from each year of the boom . Surprisingly , this took only three hours , even in a city where most baby boomers have become experts in avoiding the solicitations of an approaching stranger . <p> We asked them to describe a typical boomer and comment on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most boomers saw themselves as different from other boomers . Remember , though , that these were all California boomers . <p> Ann Reder , 46 , a former teacher who now volunteers in schools , says she is different because " I 've maintained my liberal political philosophy . " <p> John Nocks , 45 , a thrice-divorced , unemployed social service worker , thinks a typical boomer is someone who is " married , with a family , career  --  the whole shot . Everything you dreamed about when you were growing up . It does n't always work out . " <p> Lidia Rodriguez , 28 , a Macy 's sales associate and student , our youngest baby boomer , does not feel typical because she thinks of boomers as " middle-class , about 40 to 45 years old and better-educated than we are . " <p> But many of the people we spoke to said they are typical boomers . Bernard Simisim , 33 , a brokerage firm auditor , says he used to think of a boomer as someone with a briefcase , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I stay home more , " he says . " I do n't go dancing , I do n't do fun things . " <p> Wendy Lesser , 39 , a writer and editor , says in a moment of candor that she is typical because she likes parties and " superficial contacts " more than her older husband . <p> Even serious researchers are not immune to glib pronouncements about the baby boom . <p> " Older baby boomers are better in bed , " says Stanford Research Institute futurist Tom Mandel , himself an older baby boomer . <p> More seriously , Mandel , in an influential study in the late ' 80s , once divided boomers by lifestyle and values into sustainers , emulators , achievers , experientals and societally conscious types . <p> BOOMER TYPES <p> Today , he looks at boomers as three groups : those who had their formative experience in the ' 60s and worried about the draft and the war in Vietnam ; those who were formed in the ' 70s and were influenced by the Bee Gees and " Saturday Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were teenagers during the first Reagan administration . <p> He says the major distinction is between the older group , which came of age in a Dionysian era of challenging authority and sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll , and the younger group , which came of age in the ' 70s , the era of Watergate , losing the war in Vietnam , discrediting the CIA and the first oil shocks . <p> But Mandel also cautions against too much stereotyping by age , which does n't take into account the differences between male and female boomers and the fact that the TREBs are more ethnically diverse . <p> " Lifestyle and interests are still a better way to lump them together than age . " <p> GENERATION GAP <p> Whatever their differences , Cheryl Russell , author of " 100 Predictions for the Baby Boom , " says the differences between the leading edge and the trailing edge will evaporate during the ' 90s as TREBs catch up with LEBs and come under " the great levelers of lifestyle  --  children and a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 2000 as the LEBs become empty nesters and think about retirement , she says . But now more than ever , " the baby boom is a generation of like- minded people . " <p> If we could just come up with the right product  --  say a cross between a Mickey Mouse watch , an electric guitar and the fountain of youth  --  we could be in Strawberry Fields forever .  --  <p> LIFE ON THE EDGES : COMPARING THE BABY BOOMER <p> The American obsession with identifying the minutiae of boomerdom occasionally borders on the absurd . Recent studies on baby boomers from sources as diverse as PF Flyers tennies and the Population Reference Bureau reveal these differences between leading-edge and trailing-edge <p> LEADING EDGE BOOMERS TRAILING EDGE BOOMERS ( Born 1946-1954 ) ( 1955-1964 ) 41% churchgoers 67% believe in the devil First kiss on front porch First kiss at the prom More liberal More apathetic Expanding behinds Shrinking job opportunities May get last Social Security funds Will be hit with 67 retirement 88% have at least one child 63% have at least one child Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your mouth , not Remembers " Oh , I wish I were an on your hands .
