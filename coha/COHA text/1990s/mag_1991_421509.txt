<p> In the most self-consuming of cities , an impressive and little-known architectural legacy remains to show us how New Yorkers have lived and prospered since the days when the population stood at around one thousand TABLE <p> Famous for tearing down the old and for being oblivious of its past , New York City would hardly seem to be the kind of place in which to find a distinguished collection of fine old houses . Yet a surprising number do exist  --  sentinels from another era , survivors that stand quietly and incongruously in the midst of the city 's endless cycle of growth and obliteration . Among the most remarkable are sixteen properties that have recently been awarded special attention by the city and that provide an unexampled look at architectural styles , craftsmen 's skills , and social customs in the New York area over two and a half centuries . They range all the way from the serene , elegant , and nobly situated Gracie Mansion , home of New York 's mayors , down to the humble little Wyckoff House in the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the city 's oldest dwelling . Many have been home to personages like Aaron Burr and Edgar Allan Poe ; one was the temporary residence of George Washington . Others have been the sites of great events . A 1776 meeting in Staten Island 's Conference House affected the course of the American Revolution . Together they serve as a reminder that New York , for all its apparent disregard for the past , is by far the oldest large city in the United States and has plenty to show for it . Not only most Americans but most New Yorkers , too , are scarcely aware that the houses are there and are surprised to learn that nearly all of them  --  even the extraordinary Richmondtown Restoration on Staten Island , a kind of Williamsburg in the making  --  are readily reachable by public transportation . All are open to the public . <p> Many survived to the present by some fluke  --  a single family 's continued ownership , or the chance near miss of the bulldozer . Even so , despite the recent vogue for historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept many of them going during hard times , most of the properties have been chronically strapped for funds for repairs or improved programs . Recently , however , a mechanism for providing money and expertise was set up with the creation by the city of the Historic House Trust of New York City , a body of public-spirited , influential citizens whose fund raising efforts are already showing results . The lovely buildings look better and are receiving more expert attention . Said the trust 's director , Mary Ellen W. Hern of New York 's Parks Department ( which administers the project ) , " Our goal is to have pristine , properly set gems . " As the work progresses , they should glow even more brightly . <p> The six of these exceptional properties shown here give a sense of the scope and charm of one of New York 's least-known resources .
