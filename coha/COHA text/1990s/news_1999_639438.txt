<p> As millenniums go , it 's been a fairly decent 1,000 years . <p> Sure , we 've had our ups and downs . Human beings remain capable of wretched acts of venality and violence . <p> Yet other traits of our species - the ability to sacrifice self for the common good , pursue justice and decency , uplift the downtrodden and teach journalists how to spell ' millennium ' without consulting the dictionary - seem to have actually flowered . <p> But when you view the historic sweep of the past 10 centuries , trying to sort out the big events from the small , the watershed moments from the so-so , the Battle of Hastings from Zsa Zsa Gabor 's cop-slapping , you 're struck by one thing : <p> Whatever else can be said about this millennium , it was the era that produced the phenomenon known as ' hype . ' <p> You 've seen hype in action , perhaps been swept up in it . Hype takes a perfectly respectable event and inflates it out of all proportion to its relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tale grows in the telling . <p> Which brings us to the most overhyped events of the past 1,000 years . Or , at least , the December 1999 version . Scan the list , and you 'll notice it is weighted toward events of the past 200 years . There 's a reason for that . Hype is largely the product of the information age . <p> Flogging a subject becomes much easier when you have a record of the event - preferably a visual , oral and written version of it - coupled with the ability to disseminate it widely and easily . The 15th century advent of the printing press , with its movable type , was a big step in that direction . Ditto for the rise of public education and libraries . <p> But when it comes to dialing the hype machine up to 11 , nothing humans have devised matches the holy trinity of radio , television and motion pictures . <p> Consider the Hindenburg airship disaster of 1937 . The fiery crash was spectacular , broadcast by radio ( ' Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph . As disasters go , it was rather small in scale , with 35 deaths . Yet it is seared into the public consciousness . <p> Just 30 years earlier , drought and famine killed 24 million people in China . If you did n't know that , do n't feel bad . It 's not generally taught in U.S. schools . <p> Think 1992 's Hurricane Andrew was bad ? It spawned a ton of news coverage and compelling photographs . Yet in 1900 , a hurricane sent a 20-foot storm surge over Texas ' Galveston Island , killing about 8,000 people , the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history . <p> With little or no photographic record of the Texas and China disasters , their magnitude is largely lost to time . <p> Good press helps . <p> Take the Trojan War , whose mythic stature is probably rooted in a trade conflict circa 1200 B.C. Granted , the victorious Greeks benefited from a pretty swell storyteller named Homer . <p> But can you imagine how far Achilles and his homies might have gone with a press agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have wound up with a lot more than just a few marble statues and a detergent sporting his name . <p> Here are a few of this millennium 's most over-hyped stories . Some , such as the legend surrounding Joan of Arc , are a result of the myth-making that goes with the rise of nations . Others are pure products of the information age . <p> Joan of Arc <p> That the Maid of Orleans was a resourceful young woman who heard voices , acted on these visions and inspired the French armies that were fighting the English in 1429 is beyond dispute . That she was some sort of 15th century cross between Wonder Woman and George Patton is , well , hooey . <p> Contrary to the legend , Joan of Arc was no military strategist . Rather , she was a well-meaning peasant girl who parlayed her visions into a two-year run as a sort of mascot and front-woman to the Dauphin , the man who became Charles VII , and was executed for her troubles after she was ratted out to the English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her efforts did make her a Catholic saint , the national heroine of France , and the subject of one of the worst movies of 1999 - accomplishments enough for any millennium . <p> Columbus discovers <p> America <p> This ' fact ' was hyped for centuries . It 's one thing to tout a story based on lack of information . After all , archaelogical proof that the Vikings visited North America 500 years before a certain sailor was not unearthed until this century . <p> But to laud Columbus as America 's discoverer in the face of the fact that he was greeted by the New World 's original inhabitants is one of the great head-scratchers of the Age of Discovery . <p> Columbus ' arrival was a huge event , because he effectively did discover the New World for the nations of Europe . That changed history - and Western thinking - as profoundly as any event . <p> What tends to get overlooked about Columbus ' first voyage is his extraordinary feat of seamanship and navigation . That was his real achievement . <p> The prophecies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , this 16th century French astrologer predicted everything from the rise of Hitler to the moon landing . But if you take a hard look at those prophecies , which tend to be nebulous and lacking in detail , it becomes clear that with enough vagueness , anyone can come off looking like a soothsayer for the ages . <p> Besides , if this guy was any shakes as a seer , would n't he have said something about the Broncos going in the tank this season ? <p> The Alamo <p> A bunch of toughs , ambitious politicians and bored dirt farmers hole up in a crumbling San Antonio mission and decide to slug it out with a Mexican Army that outnumbers them by about 50 to 1 . The whole thing is just too Texas for words . A tactical disaster - all 120 defenders died in the fight or were slaughtered in the aftermath - the event was instantly mythologized , neatly overlooking the fact that many of the dead were dubious adventurers with decidedly mixed motives . <p> Stanley and Livingston <p> Ah , now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Scottish explorer in Africa , who , after a series of triumphs ( the discovery of the Zambezi River and Victoria Falls ) , set out in 1866 to find the source of the Nile . Satellite communication in the 19th century was n't what it is today , and he effectively dropped out of sight . <p> In 1871 , the New York Herald-Examiner sent Sir Henry Morton Stanley in search of Livingston , not because it was such a heart-pounding mystery , but because they knew it would make terrific copy . <p> Indeed it did . Stanley 's greeting - ' Dr. Livingston , I presume ? ' - became immortal . So did the story of his trip , which was , by and large , a routine journey by a reporter with a great expense account . <p> Lucky Lindbergh <p> Aviator Charles A. Lindbergh pulled off an epic bit of flying when he made the first solo , nonstop trans-Atlantic flight in 1927 . But in hindsight the hoopla surrounding the trip in The Spirit of St. Louis seems hard to fathom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in a jet a mere 20 years later . Lindbergh 's flight was a major act of faith and will on his part , but you find yourself thinking : Someone had to do it , and it was inevitable that it was going to happen soon . Unlike , say , the voyages of seagoing discovery . <p> The Hindenburg disaster <p> Testimony to the power of the moving picture and the radio broadcast , this accident would not have seared itself in the popular imagination if not for the footage of the dirigible going down in flames - over and over and over again . <p> In a way , the Hindenburg disaster was the precursor to today 's TV newscasts , in which a one-car fatality becomes the lead story simply because the station has dramatic footage of the crushed vehicle . <p> Star Wars Episode 1 : <p> The Phantom Menace <p> Was anyone on Spaceship Earth spared the relentless promotion of the fourth Star Wars installment in the spring of 1999 ? We did n't think so . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquiescence of print and electronic media feeding at George Lucas 's trough , two facts remain : The movie was almost painful to watch and , by July , Jar-Jar Binks dolls were selling for half-price in toy store remainder bins . <p> The New Millennium <p> The weird thing is , no one can even agree when the thing actually arrives . <p> What you ca n't argue about is that for a couple of billion people on the planet , the Chinese among them , the year 2000 does n't really mean anything , as long as their computers do n't fail and they can still get good seats to Neil Diamond 's New Year 's Eve concert at the Pepsi Center . @p#
