WITH FOUR PRESCHOOLERS OF HER OWN , registered massage therapist Valerie Anderson has massaged a lot of babies ! Now she is sharing this know - how with the nine women who have come , with their babies , to her baby massage workshop . " Hello , sweetie , " she croons to the baby nearest her . " Can I massage your leg ? " I think it 's really important to show respect for babies ' bodies right from the beginning , " explains Anderson , " to let them know when you 're starting the massage , and to listen when they tell you they do n't want it . " Remember , massage is supposed to be enjoyable , so if it 's making your baby fretful , she 's likely had enough for now . Anderson is a strong believer in the benefits of massage for children . " Studies are coming in now that show wonderful therapeutic benefits for special - needs babies like preemies or drug - addicted babies . But for any baby , massage is soothing and nurturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communicate with each other . " As she talks , the mothers strip the babies down to their undershirts and diapers ( the room has been well - heated beforehand ) and Anderson passes out containers of oil . " The oil allows your hand to move smoothly over the skin , without chafing it , " she says . " I use olive or canola oil  --  I would n't want to disturb a baby 's sense of smell with heavy fragrances . And you should never use a petroleum - based baby oil  --  that clogs the skin . " Rubbing her oiled hands to warm them , Anderson holds her " demo " baby 's foot in one hand and strokes from ankle to thigh with the other , smoothly circling the thigh and returning down to the foot . " With well babies I like the strokes to go towards the heart  --  from ankle to thigh or wrist to shoulder . You do n't need to use pressure  --  just the weight of your hand is enough . " Anderson is eager to take some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every parent already applies massage , " she says . " Throughout the world , people naturally massage their babies . I 'm just showing you some easy techniques you can use to build on what you already do . " Although the " full " massage Anderson is demonstrating takes about a half - hour to complete , she stresses that massage is easily adapted to whatever time and opportunity you have . " Active babies can only take so much to start with , " she says . " You have to respect that . Gradually , they learn to enjoy it for longer periods . You can massage a baby 's back while rocking him , or stroke his legs during a diaper change . It 's easy to incorporate massage into everyday baby care . " The moms are now gently " wringing ' their babies " legs from thigh to ankle in the two - handed twisting motion kids call a " rope burn . " ( The oil , of course , gives it quite a different sensation ! ) Then their hands slide around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stroke back up the thigh . Keep eye contact with your babies , talk to them , " Anderson encourages . We move on to the tummy . " Now this one point is critical , " cautions Anderson . " The tummy must be massaged in the same direction as the digestive system moves  --  clockwise . You start at the baby 's lower right side  --  go up , across the top of the abdomen , and down to the lower left corner . Do n't apply pressure  --  it 's a smooth , circular motion using the whole hand . If babies are gassy or bloated , this can help them pass gas . " For baby 's chest , Anderson describes a big heart : both hands up the breast - bone , then dividing to make the lobes of the heart ( " around and into the armpits " ) and meeting again at the bottom of the breastbone . The arms are massaged like the legs , stroking from wrist to shoulder , " wringing " the arm gently , massaging the hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session , the babies have been remarkably quiet and content . Some are visibly luxuriating in the stroking ; some seem almost mesmerized . Anderson points out with approval how one mother of a more active tot has managed a chest and tummy rub with her baby sitting in her lap . Do you want to carry on and try the back ? " asks Anderson . " It 's a nice way to bring up burps . " Everyone seems eager to keep going . As one mom remarks , " This is relaxing for me , too ! " The babies are placed on their tummies . Their mothers start at the bum and stroke up either side of the spine . " Do n't put pressure directly on the spine , " says Anderson . " That needs to be protected . " Her hands slide up over the baby 's shoulders and down each side of her back . " Include the bum in this massage . The muscles in the buttocks work hard . " Towards the end of the back massage , the babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussing , and the relaxed atmosphere becomes more strained . It 's time to end the session . But it 's clearly been a great success . Anderson offers a few last words as the babies are dressed , nursed , or let loose to explore : You need to experiment a bit , see how massage affects your baby . Some will be put to sleep ; others will be stimulated . Either way , it 's a wonderful tool for showing your love . " <p>
