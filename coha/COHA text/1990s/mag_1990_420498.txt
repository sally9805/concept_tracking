Section : BUSINESS If all the recession talk and layoff headlines have you scared , here 's a guide to calculating the odds <p> Lynne Waller Scanlon was living that anointed 1980s lifestyle : great job , great digs , great toys . She ran two advertising-industry publications and had just beefed up her ad-sales staff . Did she have problems ? Sure : it was hard to remember whether she had left her briefcase at her New Jersey home , her place in the Hamptons or her Manhattan pied-a-terra . Then she found out what trouble really is . Late one afternoon last March , her boss called her into his office , asked his secretary for a glass of water and then closed the door . " I have some very bad news , " he said . " This is it . This is the last day . " Facing a slowdown in the advertising and publishing industries , her company had decided to kill both publications . Scanlon was told to fire her entire staff by the end of the day  --  just 59 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her head was spinning . " ' How am I going to tell my staff ? ' I remember thinking , " and then , " At least he got me a glass of water . ' then he drank the water himself . Glug , glug . " <p> Out the door . Hit the road . Finis . As storm clouds darken the economic landscape for the first time in eight years , the pink slips are blowing . Military contractor McDonnell Douglas has announced it will eliminate as many as 17,000 jobs ; Chase Manhattan , 5,000 . Aetna Life and Casualty said last Friday it would eliminate 2,600 jobs . Even tony Saks Fifth Avenue will pare away 700 positions . In all , U.S. job cutbacks could nearly triple this year , from 111,285 in 1989 to about 300,000 by the end of 1990 , according to Workplace Trends newsletter . And so far in the fourth quarter of this year , announcements of corporate-staff cuts have come at a rate of more than one each business day . Whether we are already in a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as economist Alexander Paris , president of Illinois-based Barrington Research Associates , wrote recently , " If it walks and talks like a duck , it is a cluck , ' it really does n't matter what we call it , the economy has been hurting for some time . " <p> This slump is bringing down a lot of people who-did n't think it could happen to them : white-collar workers , whose ranks swelled in the service-oriented 1980s . Of the nearly 81,000 positions eliminated in 1,219 U.S. corporations between July 1989 and June 1990 , 44.6 percent were managerial or professional  --  up from roughly 34 percent a year before , according to a study released last week by the American Management Association . It could get much worse : Workplace Trends editor Dan Lacey estimates that as announced layoffs take effect , as many as 70 percent will strike white-collar workers . Suddenly , professionals like Scanlon are finding that good credentials and hard work are n't enough to keep them off the unemployment rolls . <p> Not everyone is convinced that the " white-collar recession " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan Stanley , calls such talk " fearmongering . " As he points out , " Manufacturing lost more jobs in the last two months than Wall Street did in a year . And yet , this gets billed as a white-collar recession . It makes you wonder . " Still , as they read the headlines about " down-sizing " and hear dinner-table stories about Yuppie layoffs , the perception is growing among whitecollar workers that something has gone badly awry ( page 48 ) . <p> If you 're starting to pick at your cuticles , you 're not the only one . Of those polled for NEWSWEEK , more than half know someone who has been laid off or fired recently  --  and l 20 percent believe that they could be next ( page 46 ) . But it 's possible to eliminate some of the uncertainty . The business cycle creates both losers and winners , and the more you know about how recessions work , I the easier it is to figure out whether your I company is in trouble or not  --  and whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating the odds : <p> One way to gauge your job security is I to look at the health of your industry . Of ' the fields in trouble , the biggest damage is being done to those that boomed in the 1980s . It is the job of recessions , after all , to wring excess from the economy  --  and I nowhere has excess been so wretched as on Wall Street , which has seen staffing I drop from a peak of about 265,000 before the October 1987 crash to an estimated 215,000 by the end of this year , according to analyst Michael Goldstein of Sanford C. Bernstein &; Co . Real estate , a high flier in the past decade , also fell hard . The industries that rode the Wall Street and real estate booms , like banking , insurance and law , are riding back down with the bust . So are retailers , who overextended themselves trying to fill the surplus shopping malls that developers flung up . Such consumer-dependent businesses as hotels and restaurants will also take a hit . <p> Yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created equal . " It is the company that is the employer , not the industry , " says Oscar Ornati , professor of management at New York University 's Stern School of Business . A badly run company will have problems in a recession whether it 's supposed to be recession-resistant or not ; the best-run companies will survive and enjoy the spoils from the fallen . Cathleen W. Mackey , a financial analyst for Gruntal &; Co. , says retailer Wal-Mart has the right stuff for the long haul : a healthy balance sheet and low prices . " Even in the Northeast , " says Mackey , " men still need to shave and women will still wear deodorant . " <p> How your company will fare might also depend on where it is : the nation is n't feeling the recession evenly . Rolling recessions began in the early 1980s when the high dollar stung heavy manufacturing , particularly steel and automobiles . Next came agriculture , then energy , then real estate and now financial services . Says Mark Drabenstott , an economist at the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see today in New York newspapers resemble the stories I read in Des Moines and Dallas papers a few years ago . " New York is in pain , but Boston is the real epicenter of the recession . The Northeast 's ' 80s prosperity , based on defense , minicomputers , financial services and real estate , has come back to earth with a sickening thud . Frederick Breimyer , a bank economist and president of New England Economic Project , foresees unemployment rising to 10 percent in Massachusetts in 1992  --  and even higher if the nation enters a serious slide . <p> The recession is not felt nearly so much where healthier industries like agriculture rule . Even rust-belt states stand to fare well . Until 10 years ago , Detroit was a basket case in any recession . Now the economy has diversified with service-industry jobs , from engineering to health care . That makes the region better able to handle the cycles , but the jobs do n't pay as well as the old manufacturing positions . " We might be less cyclically sensitive as kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Fulton , an economist at the University of Michigan Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations . <p> Debt could be the real company killer . These days roughly 26 percent of the cash flow in business goes to debt payments , up from 18 percent when the 1982 recession began . Many mergers , acquisitions and leveraged buyouts of the 1980s assumed a strong economy ; with less cash coming in , many companies will be crippled by their debt payments . Already , retailing mogul Robert Campeau has fallen , and developer Donald Trump has slipped off the Forbes list of 400 richest Americans . Southland , parent of 7-Eleven stores , filed for bankruptcy last week after nearly three years of struggling under the debt load of its LBO . <p> No matter how bad things get , big profits wo n't be limited to bankruptcy lawyers and outplacement firms . A number of other industries are bucking the textbook description of the business cycle . Manufacturing , which usually does poorly in tough times , was slimmed down in ' 80s restructuring and toughened by global competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trough of the recent past , aided by strong exports and a soft dollar that makes American goods look inexpensive . Thanks to more efficient inventory management , many companies wo n't be dragged down by huge buildups of goods that slowed recovery in past recessions . <p> On the other hand , industries that economists consider recession-resistant might have some problems . One executive of a Northeastern medical-supply firm says that his supposedly slump-resistant sector is hurting-in part because financially strapped patients are putting off elective surgeries . " There 's no such thing as a recession-proof industry , " he says . " When business is bad , some people may suffer less than other people , but everybody suffers . " <p> If layoffs come at your company , will your job be safe ? Your title might make a difference . The safest workers are those who contribute directly to the bottom line , like salespeople . The farther you get away from the customer , the more difficult to justify your salary in a crunch . DRI/McGraw-Hill economist David Wyss says cuts often come in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information-the role of most middle managers . The margin for error narrows , and mediocre managers who muddle through the good times could find themselves pushed out in the bad , says NYU 's Ornati . <p> Management often puts the squeeze on advertising and public relations , as well as personnel . And research and development is a common target , though Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Lisa Lynch says that R &D; might provide the company with a new product or direction that could help it get going again . " You ca n't afford the luxury of thinking long term , " she admits , " but you ca n't afford not to think long term . " And as if you were n't under enough pressure , some experts say that , like recession itself , worrying about getting fired can be a self-fulfilling prophecy . William Morin , CEO of Drake Beam Morin , a New York-based executive-outplacement firm , says , " If you 've been running around with a long face and saying , ' This is a doomsday place to work , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are more specific warning signs for your company  --  and for yourself . If the company has already tried nonlayoff alter natives like hiring freezes and early-retirement programs and is still in trouble , it should n't be too surprising that layoffs could be next . If your expense checks and/or commissions are n't being paid as quickly as usual , it 's a fair sign that cash is tight . Is the company not paying its bills , or advertising less ? More signs of shrinkage . Outplacement execs suggest several signs that should put you on red alert : you may notice that another department is doing much of the work that yours used to do , or that your superiors are getting the ax . And look out if you 're not being invited to meetings that you used to attend or getting all the memos you 'd expect  --  or , for that matter , if building services stops watering your plants . <p> And now , take a deep breath . Some economists say recession fears are overblown . " There 's more anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is softness in the economy , " says one top Bush administration economist . " I think some of the gloom is a product of the historic eight-year-long expansion  --  people have n't had a chance to be pessimistic for an historically long interval . Now they 've got the chance , they 're wallowing . " In the Midwest , where less of the chill has been felt , critics call this a " media recession , " overplayed by myopic New Yorkers  --  especially financial journalists , who are seeing their profession weaken and the value of their own assets drop . Yet , as much as it might rankle the rest of the nation , there 's little doubt that when New York gets a chill , the rest of the country shivers along with it . If a company 's headquarters is in Boston or New York , it scarcely matters that the Omaha branch is doing well-the whole company will feel the squeeze . <p> Like all cycles , the business cycle turns up as well as down , and the economy ought to head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from now if instability in the banking industry and other nations dries up the capital that would let business expand again . But another hidden cost could present itself once the economy heads upward . Just as thousands are losing their jobs , their businesses are losing them , and their expertise . " That loss of talent ca n't be good for the country , " says a former banker who speaks five languages and is now working as a temp . The next crisis  --  the expertise gap  --  awaits us . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : TRAVEL <p> Barbara Corbine , 47 , a former Air New Zealand employee , says she was fired from the only division in the company where sales were up . " It came as a total shock , " she says . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : WALL STREET <p> David Johnson , 30 , earned more than $100,000 as a Wall Street mutual-fund manager .
