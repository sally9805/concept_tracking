Tracking The Dangers of HMOs <p> Two months ago , CR presented a cover feature entitled " The Trouble With HMOs , " detailing the consumer problems involved with health maintenance organizations and " managed care " in general . <p> The point of that report was to explain the way that HMOs are structured and the way in which they typically function , and what this means to patients who are enrolled in such a program . This issue becomes increasingly acute as Medicare and Medicaid recipients , and workers with job-based health insurance , are recruited by HMOs in ever-growing numbers . <p> As our feature noted , the main difficulty with HMOs is the financial arrangement made with doctors  --  often a fixed amount of money per covered patient , together with " withholds " and bonuses for delivering care on a frugal basis . The net effect of these incentives is to reward physicians for deferring or withholding care that is seen as being too expensive  --  in essence , pitting the financial interest of the doctor against the medical interest of the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does for you , the more money he gets to keep . In particular , incentives are stacked against referring you to a specialist , authorizing a high-tech procedure , or approving a costly operation . In some HMOs , there may be a review board empowered to deny you such treatment even when your doctor says you need it . <p> The obvious danger in all this is that you may receive inadequate care , or be denied some procedure that could improve your health or even save your life . In our previous article , we referred to the mounting number of press accounts and official studies that tell us this is exactly what is occurring . The volume of these is so great that we could only summarize them in that discussion . <p> This month we offer a selection from these reports , culled from a great many others , appearing in newspapers around the nation and in studies by various agencies of government . Among the topics covered are : 1 ) The incentives of the HMO approach and resulting instances of care denial ; 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource constraints ; and 3 ) the questionable methods sometimes used to recruit senior citizens and others into such programs .  --  Ed . Denial of Care <p> A look at how Intergroup has structured the compensation schedule for its physicians suggests that it provides incentives for lesser care . In addition to paying its 30 group practices a fee for each person who selects one of its primary care physicians , Intergroup creates " shared-risk " pools to cover hospital stays and referrals to specialists . If a group 's hospitalization expenses come in below a predetermined amount , Intergroup and its physician groups divide and pocket the savings . If expenses go over the limit , the costs come out of doctors ' pockets . <p> In other words , while traditional fee-for-service physicians earn more by doing more , Intergroup doctors earn more by doing less . " Their bonuses are based on how little they do , " says one former Intergroup doctor , adding that " even the best ones " have difficulty making treatment decisions because they realize a referral could hurt them financially or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . "  --  The Washington Post , March 13 , 1994 <p> <p> Some doctors and health care executives say the system encourages primary care doctors to provide more preventive care . But others say it changes the way physicians think about patients for the worse and may encourage them to shun patients with high risks or expensive health problems . <p> " There are no economic incentives to take care of people , " Chevy Chase internist Daniel J. Esposito says . " The incentive is not to do anything . " <p> James N. Ramey , one of a group of Washington doctors trying to organize their own network , said that years ago , a patient in a capitated health plan called him complaining of severe chest pains , which signaled that the man 's care would likely be costly and time-consuming . <p> " To my horror , my first reaction was , ' You ca n't do that to me , ' " Ramey says .

Sometimes big numbers are involved . Duke , for example , plans to eliminate 1,500 of 6,500 hospital jobs and cut its $500 million budget by $65 million a year . . . . <p> On the West Coast there had been drastic reductions in the number of surgical procedures as insurers switched to a system of payment that rewarded saving money rather than spending it .  --  The New York Times , November 29 , 1994 <p> <p> Just after dawn on April 25 , two patients arrived for scheduled surgery at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park , Queens . Denise Verbeeck , a mildly retarded , 27-year-old former Special Olympic athlete , was about to undergo routine elective surgery on a damaged kneecap .

After successful surgery , both had suffered disastrous complications under the care of the hospital 's anethesiologists . Ms. Verbeeck died on May 7 ; Mr. Reback suffered severe brain damage and fell into a deep , permanent coma . In addition to those cases , two other patients at the hospital died from similar complications in recent months , and another suffered damage to a crucial artery  --  a cluster of complications that experts say is extraordinary for a single hospital in a 10-week span . . . . <p> Many doctors say that a reorganization of the hospital 's anesthesia department concluding in 1991 , which replaced private doctors with lower-paid and less-experienced salaried physicians , has turned the hospital 's operating and recovery rooms into fertile grounds for trouble . . . . <p> This cluster of deaths and injuries is drawing dose attention at a time when hospitals all across the country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare themselves for managed care .  --  The New York Times , August 1 , 1995 <p> <p> Last month Mary Oquendo had breast surgery at Johns Hopkins Medical Center at 7:30 in the morning . At noon , she was discharged from the hospital and went home . . . . <p> Mrs. Oquendo , 51 years old , says she was glad to avoid a night in the hospital after a lumpectomy and lymph-node dissection . She returned home , though , with incision wounds that needed to be drained and dressed twice a day . That duty fell to her grown daughter , Cathy Wagner , who had to move in to take care of her mother for several nights . Hospitals generally provide training for family members in such cases , teaching them briefly about basic procedures and the signs of infection . <p> Doing more outpatient surgery " makes you look more cost-effective , " says William Dooley , codirector of the Johns Hopkins Breast Center and Mrs. Oquendo 's surgeon . " But I 'm not sure , if you look at the costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're transferring a lot of care to people 's families . That may require a relative to take time off work for a couple of days . " <p> Still , in an environment of cost-cutting , doctors and hospital officials say they do n't have much choice .  --  The Wall Street Journal , August 11 , 1994 <p> <p> She was 78 years old , lived alone , and could hardly walk , let alone climb the stairs to her second-floor bathroom after surgery to replace both knees . <p> The health maintenance organization that provides her benefits under Medicare declined to authorize home treatment when the woman returned to her Braintree house in the spring , said Cathy Glenzel , a state worker who counsels South Shore elders on health insurance . <p> Glenzel said the HMO argued that the woman did not need home care because she was on crutches and could get around . To get by , the woman lines up rides to therapy sessions and uses a commode , with a relative coming in once a day to empty it . <p> Glenzel says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and other local advocates for the elderly say it is a problem seen with increasing frequency since HMOs began a push to enroll Medicare recipients last year .  --  The Patriot Ledger , Quincy , Mass. , July 31 , 1995 <p> <p> At California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco , organ transplant specialists have turned down patients who might have been given transplants in the past even though they had poor prospects for recovery , said Barry Levin , vice chairman of the hospital 's department of transplantation . Without transplants , these patients have no chance of survival , he said . <p> Because managed care plans cap payments for surgery and follow-up care , " the sicker that patient is , the less chance you 're going to have . . . of making a profit or breaking even on the case , " Levin said . " You unconsciously or even consciously begin to look at patients differently . "  --  The Washington Post , August 7 , 1995 <p> <p> Loren Johnson , M.D. , a Sacramento , Calif. , emergency physician , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed care plans in their effort to pass coverage requirements in the state legislature this year . <p> In one case , a plan denied authorization for a patient with a possible spine fracture and in another , a patient with an externalizing arterial hemorrhage was told to leave an emergency department and seek treatment at a plan physician 's office , he said . <p> " There has been a great deal of gatekeeper misbehavior and failure to understand emergency medical procedures , " Dr. Johnson said . " That puts patients in a position of choosing between their lives and their pocketbooks , even though they are insured and these should be covered services . "  --  American Medical News , November 14 , 1994 <p> <p> The Florida Sun-Sentinel conducted a year-long investigation of the state 's Medicaid HMOs , reviewing thousands of pages of state physician-performance data and other documents . The paper published its findings last December . The investigation reported a number of instances of patients denied care or given inappropriate care by their HMOs , often with catastrophic results . <p> Among them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer went undetected by her HMO until it was too advanced to treat . She died in May , 1993 , aged 29 , six months after her condition was misdiagnosed as an ulcer . <p> The case of a five year-old girl whose brain tumor was repeatedly misdiagnosed as the flu until her desperate mother took her to a facility outside the HMO prompted state officials to say : " It appears that the HMO has been hedging on authorizing medical treatment until after the fact . " The HMO not only failed to diagnose the girl 's condition , it refused to pay for the surgery that resulted from the correct diagnosis . <p> In the case of a six year-old boy who suffered emotional and developmental difficulties following a car crash in 1991 , a neurologist recommended a specialized imaging test of the boy 's brain functions . The family 's HMO refused to pay the $900 for the test , claiming " medical necessity was not demonstrated . " For six months , the neurologist fought for the test . Only when the boy 's mother threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They make it sound so sweet when you sign up for a Medicaid HMO , " she said . " They say they 'll pay for everything . Then something like this happens , and you find out how much trouble it is to get a simple test . " <p> " Physicians Who Care " charge that some HMOs or contracting medical groups purposely do not contract with specialists with expertise in certain conditions or procedures and then refuse to authorize out-of-plan care for patients who need this expertise . This was true in one well-publicized case in California . Following an HMO 's refusal to refer a young girl for appropriate treatment by her HMO for her Wilm 's tumor , the California Department of Corporations fined the HMO $500,000 for failure to provide appropriate care and failure to demonstrate that its refusal was not affected by fiscal considerations . The physician whom the HMO had originally assigned to perform the surgery had previously neither operated on children nor on a Wilm 's tumor.  --  Statement of Geraldine Dallek , M.P.H. , of the Center for Health Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , August 3 , 1995 <p> <p> Beginning in October 1991 , Lilia Reyes , a program manager for the U.S. Conference of Mayors and a mother of two , complained to her HMO of abdominal pains , bowel irregularities , and other problems . By early 1992 , when blood was detected in her stool , she told her . . . doctor that she feared she had colon cancer , according to court records of a malpractice suit . <p> At a trial last year , expert witnesses for Reyes testified that at the outset of Reyes 's treatment she should have been given a sigmoidoscopy , which almost certainly would have revealed her problem . A cancer specialist called to testify by the HMO said that test would have been " acceptable " but not " necessary . " <p> Physician Karen Bledsoe , an employee of the HMO at the time , diagnosed Reyes 's problem as irritable bowel syndrome . Bledsoe testified that , before she could refer a patient to a specialist for a sigmoidoscopy , she would have to submit a form for review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was denied such requests in some other cases . <p> Reyes 's cancer was diagnosed in August 1992 when she underwent emergency surgery while on vacation in Florida . A tumor had blocked her colon . One of Reyes 's experts testified last November that he " would be surprised if she is still alive in a year . " <p> Reyes , 44 , said in an interview that she gave up her traditional health insurance and enrolled in the HMO in 1991 because the premiums were lower . " Sometimes you try to cut corners thinking you 're going to be saving some money , and ultimately you end up paying just an incredible price for it , " she said .  --  The Washington Post , August 7 , 1995 <p> Straining the System <p> As enrollment in health maintenance organizations soars , hospitals across the country report that HMOs are increasingly denying claims for care provided in hospital emergency rooms . <p> Such denials create obstacles to emergency care for HMO patients and can leave them responsible for thousands of dollars in medical bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HMO practices discourage patients from seeking urgently needed care . But for their part , HMOs say their costs would run out of control if they allowed patients unlimited access to hospital emergency rooms .  --  The New York Times , July 9 , 1995 <p> <p> The health maintenance organization run by the city 's public hospitals has agreed to suspend enrollment of new members from Medicaid for 30 days because of complaints about long waits , often of up to several weeks , to see a doctor . <p> The suspension of Metro Plus , which is run by the Health and Hospitals Corporation , came amid a Department of Health investigation of whether HMOs in the city have enough doctors and office space to handle the exploding influx of Medicaid patients into managed care . <p> It was the second health maintenance organization in recent weeks to agree to stop enrollment because of concerns from regulators and advocates for poor people that the managed care system was growing too quickly and that the quality of health care was being endangered .  --  The New York Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HMOs expands , problems are surfacing . In January 1994 , the state of Tennessee ordered 900,000 Medicaid recipients into managed care almost overnight ; one HMO says its membership jumped tenfold to 300,000 . <p> One result was an avalanche of complaints . Some HMOs did n't have enough primary-care doctors . Half the eligible recipients did n't choose an HMO and were arbitrarily assigned to one , leaving them with no idea which doctor or hospital to go to . Revenue at some hospitals plummeted . Moreover , HMOs have refused to pay for tens of millions of dollars of care delivered to HMO members who sought care at hospital emergency rooms . The HMOs say the patients should n't have gone there .  --  The Wall Street Journal , April 12 , 1995 <p> <p> A survey by the Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) of more than 4,000 enrollees and disenrollees from 45 Medicare HMOs across the country found that 20%-25% of disenrollees said they failed to receive primary care , referrals to specialists , and HMO coverage of emergency care they believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16% of enrollees and 18% of disenrollees reported having to wait more than 12 days to see their primary care HMO doctor , while 24% of enrollees and 26% of disenrollees reported having to wait more than 12 days to see a specialist . In addition , the report found that " an alarmingly high level of dissatisfaction with the care provided by HMOs is experienced by chronically ill and disabled patients , " and " Confusing and harmful limitations exist on access to emergency medical care . "  --  Report of the DHHS Office of the Inspector General , March 1995 <p> <p> A Mathematica Policy Research report to the Health Care Financing Administration ( HCFA ) from as far back as February 1987 revealed that " what some HMOs say they have in place as quality assurance programs are n't actually operating effectively , and in some cases are n't operating at all . " In testimony before the Senate Special Committee on Aging on August 3 , 1995 , the General Accounting Office again cited HCFA for not doing enough to assure the quality of care received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more needs to be done and pointed out that the system is already strained to its limits by the exponential growth of HMOs in recent years , a growth that is continuing at a rate of 75,000 a month . Marketing Practices <p> To recruit members , HMOs typically offer retirees dance tickets or a free meal at a restaurant in return for listening to a 45-minute sales pitch . Recruiters earn $60 or more for each member they enroll , and top salespeople say they sign up about 40% of those who hear a presentation .  --  The Wall Street Journal , April 27 , 1995 <p> <p> Mrs. B. , an elderly Los Angeles widow with a fifth grade education , received an unsolicited visit from an HMO marketing agent . The agent tried to pressure her into joining by telling her that Medicare would not be in existence much longer . When she told the agent she was not interested , the representative persuaded her to sign an enrollment form by telling her that it would only be used to verify the agent 's visit .  --  Dallek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> For $201 a month , what does a city Medicaid patient get from the local health maintenance organizations that take the city 's poor as clients ? <p> A personal doctor , for one thing . Visits to the doctor 's office . Prescriptions , referrals , health education , nutrition counseling and hospital services . <p> Some can even get transportation to their appointments , free telephone service and weekly aerobic classes . In the case of Chartered Health Plan , they get an award-winning advertising campaign warning them against drugs and alcohol , crime and teen pregnancy .  --  The Washington Times , May 15 , 1995 <p> Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran , Jr . recently announced that charges had been filed against 24 state employees who took bribes to pass on confidential information to HMO marketing agents  --  under pressure to meet sales quotas and eager to earn commissions  --  who used the information to enroll Medicaid recipients in HMOs without their knowledge .

If that did n't work , their signatures were often forged anyway . Carolyn McElroy , deputy director of Maryland 's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit , told the Baltimore Sun that some of the forgeries are so crude that the names are misspelled . The Sun also documented instances in which marketers target children , offering them crayons and coloring books , or tickets to win a party at Chuck E. Cheese , or a chance to meet the " Easter Bunny " ( someone dressed up in a bunny costume ) in return for their parents ' signing up for the HMO . The Florida Sun-Sentinel discovered similar instances of marketing fraud during its year-long investigation of Medicaid HMOs , including cases where the signatures of severely retarded or disabled individuals were forged and others where language difficulties were exploited to enroll migrant farm workers and recent immigrants who did n't know what they were signing up for .

A 1991 study of California HMOs by the Medicare Advocacy Project concluded that " Medicare beneficiaries are extremely vulnerable to misleading marketing by HMOs , " and that those who enroll in HMOs " have few meaningful appeal rights " if they disagree with a physician about seeing a specialist .  --  House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health , July 27 , 1995 <p> <p> <p>
