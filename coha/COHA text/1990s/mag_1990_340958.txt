Mikhail Gorbachev is not the only leader with separation anxieties . Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is also finding it difficult keeping his vast nation together , and Canada has only two warring nationalities . <P> For decades , the French-speaking majority in Quebec has sought official recognition as a " distinct society " within the overwhelmingly English- speaking nation . Three years ago , at a meeting with the ten provincial premiers at Meech Lake in the Gatineau hills of Quebec , Mulroney devised a set of amendments that would finally satisfy the demands of the Quebecois and bring them to sign the national constitution " with honor and enthusiasm . " But by last week the Meech Lake accord had turned a symbol of renewed division and intolerance between English- and French-speaking Canadians . <P> Three provinces reject it , in part because they claim it would grant special status to Quebec . Unless something happens to resolve the disagreement by the June 23 deadline for the accord 's final approval , Canadians will have to face the possibility of a national rupture . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulroney 's most important ally from Quebec , Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard , resigned from the government over what he sees as English-Canadian intransigence , saying , " This country does n't work anymore . We have to remake it . " <P> Canada tried to do that when it rewrote its constitution in 1982 to add a bill of rights , but the then separatist government of Quebec refused to endorse the new document . The Meech Lake accord , based on proposals put forward by Quebec 's Premier Robert Bourassa , was designed to overcome the province 's opposition . Since then , however , newly elected governments in Manitoba , New Brunswick and Newfoundland have refused to ratify it . The holdouts argue that the accord grants Quebec special legislative powers over language and culture that other provinces do not have , and could endanger the civil rights of non-French minorities in Quebec . <P> An all-party committee in Ottawa 's House of Commons two weeks ago tried to break the stalemate by suggesting the House pass both the accord and a " companion resolution " that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That proposal brought on the resignations of Bouchard and two Quebec backbenchers from the ruling party , who insist that the accord should be passed untouched and undiluted by legislative interpretations . Bouchard now says he thinks the much discussed but still vague idea of a Quebec that is / politically sovereign but retains economic links with Canada " makes sense . " Quebec , he complains , " is dying of ambiguity . " Mulroney replaced Bouchard as his political lieutenant in Quebec with Industry Minister Benoit Bouchard ( no relation ) , who said on national television that Quebec is " tired of being misunderstood . " He warned , " What we have to understand is that this country is within four weeks of collapsing . "
