<p> REVEAL BOTH AN EXCEPTIONAL ARTISTIC ABILITY AS WELL AS A A MASTERFUL KNOWLEDGE OF PRINTMAKING . EACH COMPLETED IMAGE IS THE PRODUCT OF 10 TO 12 PHOTODEVELOPED PLATES , ALL OF WHICH CARRY A SEGMENT OR LAYER OF THE FINAL IMAGE THAT HAS BEEN HAND DRAWN , INDIVIDUALLY PROCESSED , AND CAREFULLY INKED TO ACHIEVE A WATERCOLORLIKE APPEARANCE . <p> Traditionally , in photo-offset lithography , an artist provides a finished artwork , and a printer then makes four-color separations from the image , which are exposed on four photosensitized plates for cyan , magenta , yellow , and black inks . These colors reproduce the artwork . In this process the artist 's marks never contact the plate . <p> In Dula 's method , however , the marks and passages that he paints transfer directly to the paper . Using pigments in a similar manner to the way he uses watercolor or acrylic paints , he draws and paints a new and separate image for each color , which is later exposed to separate photosensitized plates . He applies opaque materials such as pencils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is these marks on the Mylar that directly contact the plate during exposure . <p> First , Dula makes a key plate that contains the total information with which all plates will be registered . The Mylar positive for this plate is used to guide the work for all the additional plates . The key plate is usually printed last to tie the image together . <p> While the Mylar is painted opaquely , the developed plates are inked with transparent or opaque color . The inks are made with time-tested artists ' pigments . <p> Dula processes the plates in a photo darkroom . The Mylar is placed on a photosensitive aluminum plate . It is then exposed under light to burn in the image . The exposure time varies according to the effect Dula wants to achieve . At times , he exposes several transparencies to the plate . Some exposures include masks designed to keep certain colors and whites clean . The plates are then developed with a photochemical solution . <p> The printing is done on an offset press , one color at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and water do not mix . When Dula processes his plates , the image he has drawn or painted becomes a surface that accepts oil but repels water , while the negative or undrawn areas will accept water . Just before printing , Dula sponges water over the plate and then immediately rolls the oil-based ink across the surface . The ink that is accepted by the image will transfer to paper during the printing process . He does this with as many as 12 plates when printing one complete image . <p> Prints made on a traditional lithographic or etching press are mirror images of the plate work . Dula uses an offset transfer press . The inked plate first prints on the rubber blanket covering a cylinder and then prints on paper . Dula prefers the extra options the offset press allows . The pad is adjusted according to the desired pressure . It may also be stamped onto the paper more than one time . <p> In 1986 , Dula joined Magnolia Editions print studio in Oakland , California . Under the tutelage of Don Farnsworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also printed for numerous artists , including Robert Arneson , Joan Brown , and William Wiley . <p> Dula 's lithographs are consistently accepted in juried exhibitions . His work is included in collections at the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts in San Francisco and the California Museum of Art in Santa Rosa , California , as weld as the Rutgers Archives at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick , New Jersey , Southern Oregon State College in Ashland , Oregon , and the U.S. State Department in Washington , DC . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Above : One Way Santa Cruz , 1991 , 12-color lithograph ( edition of 75 ) , 6 1/2 x 9 3/4 .
