He 's 25 , collects stuffed animals and still lives at home , but he may be the toughest skater ever to enter the rink . He 's tougher than Todd Eldredge , tougher than the Russians , tougher than Tonya Harding . Consider : the big rumor in Canada says that last summer Elvis Stojko , figure skater , 5 ft. 7 in. , 158 lbs. , got into a bar brawl with Eric Lindros , goonish hockey star , 6 ft. 4 in. , 236 lbs .  --  and that Lindros got the short end of the stick . Never mind that everyone denies it happened . The point is , people believe it might have happened . It 's like Tiger taking out Tyson . <P> Stojko forces people to believe . He 's the unlikeliest skating star , a short , thickly muscled man with propulsive leaping ability but a B-movie aesthetic . Judges have always disapproved of his body type , his haircut and , above all , his kickboxer style . But he has worn them down , and today he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred in the bones .

From the first , Elvis was a jumping machine . <P> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Bruce Lee . Elvis earned an advanced black belt in karate at age 16 , and while other skaters were bringing elegant dance moves into their choreography , he started incorporating punches and kicks . " I tried ballet , " says Stojko unapologetically . " Did n't fit . " <P> In a sport without a long tradition of martial-arts stylists , Elvis ' very originality was a problem . The cabal of skating judges , clacking endlessly about athletes ' clothes , musical tastes , hairstyles and breast sizes , looked at this karate kid with the shag and the metal-studded costumes  --  famously designed and stitched by his mom  --  and they saw fresh meat . " I was ridiculed , " Stojko says . " The judges said they did n't like martial arts . I was told to get in touch with my feminine side . I said , ' Buddy , I do n't have a feminine side . I 'm not a female . ' " <P> At the Albertville Olympics in 1992 Elvis skated well and finished seventh . At Lillehammer two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story . He got silver behind Russia 's classically schooled Alexei Urmanov .
