<p> Dodging traffic is as much a part of bicycling in metro Atlanta as squirming into spandex britches or strapping on a helmet , but a plan unveiled this week by the Atlanta Regional Commission ( ARC ) will carve a new niche for bikers and pedestrians . <p> The plan calls for bike and walking trails winding throughout the 10- county metro Atlanta area . Just when , and if , it will come to fruition is up to local government officials who would have to dip into the same coffers to fund bike projects as to build roads . <p> But bikers , walkers and transportation planners looking for ways to pull cars off increasingly congested roadways say the plan is a major first step . ARC officials want to hear from the roughly 2.5 million residents in the planning area . <p> The plan is available for public comment through Aug. 2 , and a public hearing is scheduled for 6 p.m. on July 29 at ARC headquarters on Northside Drive in Atlanta . <p> Fulton , Douglas , Gwinnett and DeKalb counties account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 miles of sidewalks , and dozens of other segments in Cobb , Clayton , Henry and Fayette are included in the plan . Additions are expected as Cherokee and Rockdale counties make their submissions by the end of the month . <p> " Traditionally we have not provided these facilities , " said ARC principal transportation planner David Kirk . " But a number of surveys indicate the biggest impediment to people riding bikes as a means of transportation is the provision of adequate , safe facilities . " <p> Most of the funding for the years-long effort will come from the new federal transportation bill , which allows governments to diversify their approach to transportation . <p> DeKalb officials envision a Georgia Tech to Stone Mountain bike path to be funded as the backbone of a 195-mile network of bike lanes and multi-use trails spoking out into the county along major waterways and roads like Clairmont and Buford highways and a rail spur from Lithonia to Conyers . <p> Cobb officials , who earlier had shunned bike paths because of shortfalls in the county 's roadbuilding program , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another along an abandoned rail line from south Cobb into Paulding County . County officials also included 32 sidewalk projects in their long-range plan . <p> In Gwinnett , county and community leaders have put together a package that calls for 103 miles of sidewalks and nearly 232 miles of bike paths , including a 23-mile path through the county 's heavily developed western flank and an " eastern perimeter bikeway " coursing 53 miles from the DeKalb County line to Lake Lanier . <p> In unincorporated Fulton County , nearly 173 miles of bike and multi- use paths are in the ARC 's regional plan . Roswell , Alpharetta and the city of Atlanta also have submitted ambitious proposals . Atlanta officials call for 19 bike or multi-use paths , including a route along Nancy Creek , the Chattahoochee River and along the Trolley line in east Atlanta . In Roswell and Alpharatta , multi-use paths are sketched along major routes like Georgia 120 and Georgia 9 , and weaving in and out of developing residential communities in north Fulton . <p> Clayton officials are targeting 12 multi-use paths for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the abandoned Atlanta and Fort Valley rail lines . <p> How to get involved <p> Here 's how to comment on the ARC bike and pedestrian plan : <p> A public information and comment session is scheduled July 29 from 4:30-8 p.m. at ARC headquarters , 3715 Northside Parkway , Building 200 . The public hearing will begin at 6 p.m . <p> Written comments can be submitted through Aug. 2 at ARC headquarters , 200 Northcreek , Suite 300 , 3715 Northside Parkway , Atlanta , Ga . 30327 . <p> DeKalb bike and foot trails <p> Hoping to pry commuters out of their cars and give recreational bicyclists a better course to travel , planners this week unveiled plans for a network of bicycle lanes and sidewalks throughout the 10-county heart of metro Atlanta . Some paths would break away from the road , cutting a new course for wheeling or walking between destinations . Other lanes would be a part of the road itself , but specially marked for bicycle traffic . Here are the trails and paths proposed for your area .
