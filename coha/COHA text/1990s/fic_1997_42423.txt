MIRROR Image : My sister 's anorexic . No one understands how it happened . My entire family is fat . <p> My other sisters are at least one hundred pounds overweight , and I 'm larger and taller than both of them . Suddenly we have a waif in the family . Frankly , we 'd be more comfortable with a Martian . I 'm the only one to go visit her in the hospital . I take the bus . I see the way people look at me as I wander down the aisle in search of a seat . They pray I wo n't choose the empty one next to them . It 's hot and the air conditioning is weak ; they do n't want to be squashed against the window by the Fatty . They think I 'll sweat all over them . They think I 'll smell . From the horrified looks on their faces , you 'd think fat was catching . <p> Annette wraps herself in a blanket . She looks ghostly . She stares out the window over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she barely seems to hear a word I say . After a few minutes , she asks if I have brought the cigarettes she asked for . I nod and she leads me out onto a fenced-in porch that 's not even open to the sky . She sees me looking up at the chain link fence above us . <p> " It 's for the jumpers , " she says . <p> I 'm not sure I understand , but nod anyway . I offer her the pack of cigarettes ; she takes it and lights one with my matches . <p> " Can I keep these ? " she asks . " They told me I had to bring them back to the desk on my way out , " I say . <p> She nods and hands them back to me , and then settles into a metal chair , her blanket still wrapped around her like a monk 's robe . I 'm sweating . I wipe my forehead and sit down in the chair beside her . <p> I have nothing to say to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear if I reach out to her to touch her I 'll feel nothing but steamy summer air . If I did touch her , I would feel nothing but a collection of twig like bones and papery skin . <p> Annette is the sister closest to me in age , but we 've always 's in school , always looked pretty , always smiled sweetly for dinner guests , always said the right thing when someone else felt bad . She 's always been slimmer than the rest of us , and my other sisters and I have always hated her for it . Annette 's thinness , more than anything else , has kept the two of us apart and divided her from the entire family . <p> Annette is convinced that one day she 'll be prima ballerina at the American Ballet Theater . She 's never actually taken a dance class in her life , but she has endless books and videos on technique ; they 're filled with graceful , tulle-enveloped women and men in tights leaping around on lavishly decorated stages . Before being hospitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and practiced five to six hours a day . She would roll back the carpet and practice twirling and turning on her toes . She broke a toe once , mainly because she was n't using her shoes properly , having never been trained , but she refused to stop , not even to wait until her toe had healed . Her room is plastered with posters of ballerinas . She hangs ballet slippers from her ceiling by their ribboned ties . She is obsessed . <p> At night , the rest of the family pores over old family photo albums . When did this start , we ask ourselves . How did she get to be so different from us ? In my mother , I see horror and concern ; in my father , confusion . In myself and my younger sisters , I am slowly coming to recognize that old , familiar , not-so-faint tinge of jealous , rendered exceedingly ugly now that Annette is so ill . Not only is Annette even more the center of attention than before , she has achieved that spot by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and failing , to do for our entire lives : dieting . <p> As I sit now , watching her smoke and rattling her knees together , either from cold or nerves , I feel my envy and spite acutely , like deep , open wounds gaping in the sunlight . Surely I must be the most horrid person in the world . It 's sick to be sitting here envying her thighs thinner than pencils , her fingers like fish spines , the hip bones that jut out from her stomach so sharply that they are visible even through her jeans . It 's perverse to covet the twig like arms and protruding ribs and hollow throat . But there it is . In spite of all I see before me and all I know about Annette 's own private hell , a part of me wants her sickness , and wants it now . <p> When Annette first went into the hospital a few weeks ago , Mother sat us all down in the living room and explained to us that Annette could die from this . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blackouts , loss of concentration , tooth decay , hair loss , insomnia , exhaustion , headaches , and coldness . She told us that Annette could die of any one of a number of complications resulting from electrolyte imbalances , blood sugar instability , weakening of heart muscles and other organs , or even a simple fall during a fainting spell . <p> " She has something called ketosis , " Mother said , " which means that because she 's not eating enough her body has started to digest itself . She 's got no fat left , so now she 's living off her own muscles . It makes her smell bad ; I do n't know if any of you have noticed that " . <p> I had . You never wanted to be anywhere near Annette during or after her marathon exercise sessions , and you certainly did n't want to go into a room she 'd just been working out in . There are n't words to describe that smell-it 's something between acrid and salty-sweet-but it had turned my stomach since the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , I had to work hard to keep from retching whenever I thought about it . <p> " I 'm not going to see her , " my youngest sister , Delilah. said . " She can starve herself to death if she wants , but I think it 's disgusting , and I 'm not going " . <p> " Is she in the psychiatric ward , " Mother corrected her . " Ues , she is " . <p> " I do n't want to go there , " she said . " We do n't have to , do we ? " <p> " It would be nice if you 'd go , " Mother said . " It would show your sister that you love her . But I wo n't force you . " <p> " I 'll go , " I said . I was the oldest , and although I did n't exactly relish the idea , it seemed somehow like the mature , oldest-sister kind of thing to do . Besides , I knew it would make Mother happy . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her room . I feel like a monster beside here . I 'm sure all the other patients are watching us , amazed that the Thinny has such a Fatty for a sister , I feel self-conscious . I notice that I am slouching and hanging my head between my shoulder blades . I try to stand up straight as we walk down the hall , but still I feel awkward , grotesque , freakish . <p> She shuts the door behind us and drops her blanket on the bed . <p> " They told me we had to keep the doors open if I came in here , " I say . <p> She shrugs , her shoulder bones and neck bones collapsing in on themselves and each other like a hundred match sticks falling into a haphazard pile . She perches on the end of the bed and tucks her feet under her like a bird ; she rests her chin on one of her bent knees . <p> Her stare bores into me . I feed an intense pressure to say something else , something real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move us forward in time . I rack my brain for a moment , but then it occurs to me that perhaps I 'm wrong . Perhaps my sister has no intention of moving forward in time or establishing a connection with anyone at all , much less me . She is frozen and alone ; I suddenly realize that she may very well want to stay that way . And , frankly , that scares the shit out of me . <p> Mother is sitting in the kitchen when I get home from the hospital . She 's munching on a plate of cold french fries and reading the National Enquirer , I sit down next to her and reach for a fry ; it 's almost in my mouth before I realize how cold and rubbery it feels in my fingers . Mother flips the paper closed and folds it in half , headlines and masthead down . She looks at me for a moment without speaking . <p> " What do you think of all this ? " Mother asks finally . <p> I shrug . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I knew what to say to Annette . <p> " We were pretty short on words , " I say . " We spent a lot of time just looking at each other . " <p> Mother nods . <p> " You know , I 'm her nightmare , " I say . " I 'm the horrific vision she sees in the mirror every morning . I 'm what she 's willing to die to avoid becoming . " <p> " I think that says more about her than about you , " Mother says . <p> " Maybe " . <p> I used to fantasize about being anorexic . I thought it meant being waif like and romantic ; in my mind , frailty and fragility meant being desirable and adored . People would gather around you , offering to carry things for you or cushion the wooden chair on which you sat . I thought being too thin made you exquisitely beautiful , like a delicate spun-glass figurine . You would be the heroine in a fairy tale . You would be the princess who was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath twenty mattresses . You would be Sleeping Beauty , waiting for your prince to come along and rescue you from your ghostlike state . <p> I know better now . My sister looks like the living dead . Her eyes stick out of their sockets like golf balls , and her cheekbones and jaw frame deep hollows in her face . Her collar bones and knee joints and elbows and ankles jut out of her skin . Veins run across her body like long blue earthworms wriggling under her skin.She 's not a person anymore ; she 's a breathing corpse . <p> I wake at dawn the next morning , thinking about Annette . I wonder if I would die young just in order to be thin , even for a little while . I throw my covers off and stand before the full-length mirror on the back of my closet door . There are endless epithets to describe my body . I have been through them all , time and time again ; it 's getting pretty dull . I wriggle and jiggle and ripple whenever I move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the places I 'd like to go . I 've always thought I was too big for the world . I 'm wondering now if it 's not just that the world is too small for me.Last week I tried on a skirt in a department store , and it did n't fit . I hung it back up and said to my sister Melinds , " It 's not cut wide enough for me . " I was n't too big for it ; it was too small for me . I thought about that the whole ride home from the mall . I thought about how sometimes you can turn something completely upside down and suddenly understand what it 's about in a way you never could when it was right-side up . <p> After work , I take more cigarettes to Annette . She wraps her bony fingers around the packet and fishes one out . We stand on the fenced-in porch , my sister pressing her nose against the wire . <p> " I will be out of here soon , " she says . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to go back to school . " <p> " What do you want ? " <p> " I want to dance with Baryshnikov . " <p> " Do you really think that will happen ? " <p> She nods . <p> " Maybe you should stay here a little longer , " I say . " Maybe you 're not quite ready to come home . " <p> " I wo n't be coming home , regardless , " she says . " I will be going straight to New York ; Misha wants me there right away . We 'll be doing Giselle . He 's rechoreographed the whole thing just for me . Was n't that sweet of him ? " <p> I smile . There 's nothing to say . <p> " Of course , I 'll have a lose some weight for the part , " she says . <p> On my way out , I stop the nurses ' station.I 'm supposed to tell them whenever Annette talks about dieting or losing weight . I 'm also supposed to report any indications of delusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've done the right thing by reporting Annette 's conversation . I have no idea if it is the right thing- no idea if it is the right thing- no idea at all . It 's the only thing I can do , though , so I do it . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p> Article copyright Radiance . <p>
