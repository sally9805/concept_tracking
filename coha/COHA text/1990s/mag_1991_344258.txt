UNTESTING , TESTING . In 1986 , as a result of a lawsuit filed mostly by black parents , California banned the use of I.Q. tests to measure learning disabilities in black students on the grounds that they tended to be racially discriminatory . The upshot would have seemed quirky even in South Africa : the tests were permitted for all kids except blacks . One mother of a mixed-race son was told that he could not be tested because he was registered as a black ; she was advised to reregister him as Hispanic . Now a suit to restore the tests has been filed by another set of parents of black students , who argue that barring their children from the test is racially discriminatory . <P> STAGE FRIGHT . The immigration law set to go into effect in October contains a minor provision causing major artistic anxiety : it limits to 25,000 a year the number of actors , musicians , models and athletes who can enter the U.S. to perform under temporary visas . Other oddities : applicants must be " internationally recognized " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must have been with their group at least a year . The bill was pushed by organized labor to protect American jobs , but the tight limit ( applied first come , first served ) could instead assault American culture . <P> FRUIT LOOPY . Kids , Uncle Sam wants you to eat more fruit with your cereal ! But if you 're poor , you ca n't get them in the same box . The $2.4 billion federal ( program that feeds 5 million needy children will not pay for cereal with more than six grams of sugar per serving . Kellogg protests that this excludes its Raisin Bran , because the sugar naturally contained in its raisins pushes it over the limit . So the kids eat mainly Cheerios and have to get their fruit separately . <P> ZACHARY TAYLOR BEWARE . When Ronald and Nancy Reagan decided they wanted to be buried on the grounds of his presidential library near Ventura , Calif. , environmentalists objected that it would cause pollution . No , not of the toxic waste variety ; the fuming was not that personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution . Local officials disagreed and approved the Reagans ' request . The sites-in-waiting will be ready by the time the library is dedicated in November . <P> QUOTES OF THE WEEK : <P> " They 're never going to believe this one . "  --  James ( " Whitey " ) Bulger , a well-known reputed Boston mobster , upon winning part of a $14 million Massachusetts lottery jackpot . <P> " The only person that probably would have caused more trouble is if my mother had won . "  --  state treasurer Joseph Malone , upon hearing the results .
