<p> INDEPENDENCE , Mo .  --  Lynn Yazel 's eyes settle on the modest house just across Short Street as police carry out boxes of camp fuel , glass jars , coffee filters and red phosphorous . Individually , the items have little meaning . Together , they make up the components of a methamphetamine lab . <p> " This was a nice neighborhood a few years ago , " Yazel laments . " It 's a damn shame . " <p> Yazel 's sentiments are echoed in communities throughout the Midwest , which is fast becoming the nation 's new center for the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine  --  a substance so odious that National Drug Policy Director Barry McCaffrey calls it " the crack of the ' 90s . " <p> Just six years ago , police did n't even tally meth lab seizures in the nation 's heartland because there were so few . Last year , the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) and local police seized 450 labs  --  almost half the national total  --  in the 11 states between the Rockies and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprawling suburbs and rural communities of middle America has been accompanied by an alarming surge in drug-related crime , violence and fear . <p> " It 's totally overwhelming us , " says Shirley Armstead , a spokeswoman at the DEA field office in St. Louis . <p> In 1993 , authorities seized 12 meth labs in Missouri . Last year , the DEA and local police seized 235 labs . That 's 50% more than were seized in California , a state with nearly six times the population and where meth emerged more than a decade ago as the favored drug among motorcycle gangs . And Missouri 's numbers continue to rise sharply . The first eight months of this year , authorities raided 333 labs . Kansas , Oklahoma and Arkansas also rank among the top 10 states for the production of methamphetamine . The DEA lists Minnesota and Iowa among the top 15 . <p> " No question about it , " says Lt. Dennie Jensen , who heads the Independence Police Department 's narcotics unit . " Meth has become the drug of choice in the Midwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be snorted , smoked or injected , meth produces the same sort of effect as crack cocaine : an intense " rush " followed by a state of high agitation that can lead to volatile behavior . And meth 's effect can last six to eight hours , far longer than the 20-minute high of crack . <p> " What makes methamphetamine users dangerous in their communities is that prolonged use can result in paranoid delusions , " says Carol Falkowski , a drug abuse researcher with the Minnesota Department of Human Services . " The users behave in erratic ways , sometimes violently . " <p> Authorities ca n't say precisely what the meth explosion is doing to Midwest crime rates . The DEA still tracks meth use only among criminals in Western cities . But in Portland , Ore. , San Jose , Calif. , and Phoenix , Western cities with histories of methamphetamine use , one in five people arrested test positive for the drug . <p> John Bolger of the Minnesota state police says crack use is so common in his state that police officers are instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meth users : stay 10 feet back , speak in a low pitch and do n't shine bright lights . <p> Bolger points to a 1995 murder by an Arizona man as an example of how dangerous the drug is . In that case , Eric Smith  --  high on meth for 24 hours  --  stabbed his 14-year-old son 29 times and then cut off the child 's head . He told police he thought the boy was possessed . <p> Easy as baking a cake <p> Throughout the 1980s , meth was largely a West Coast phenomenon . Motorcycle gangs hired " cooks " with solid chemistry backgrounds to concoct batches of the crumbly white powder in sophisticated labs . <p> The key ingredient , phenyl-2-propanone , was outlawed by the federal government in 1988 . Meth cooks then turned to substances like ephedrine , which is available in over-the-counter asthma and cold tablets . Making meth from ephedrine requires removing one hydrogen and one oxygen molecule from the drug 's chemical makeup . The process is as easy as baking a cake . <p> " It 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanahan of the Jackson County ( Mo . ) Drug Task Force . <p> More than 50 meth " recipes " are in circulation , many of them available on the Internet . All involve adding household acids , camp stove fuel , black iodine , red phosphorous or even lye to crushed cold tablets and cooking the brew over low heat . The " juice " is then left to stew in glass jars where the meth separates from the other chemicals . A $ 200 investment in materials can produce about $ 2,000 worth of meth . <p> The ease and relative low cost of making the drug launched a cottage industry . And the Midwest has proved an ideal location to do business . Police forces in major cities have long targeted drug operations . But meth labs located in quiet suburbs , small towns and rural areas of the Midwest are less likely to attract scrutiny . The Midwest also offers an attractive customer base . Meth users are typically white , working-class men in their 20s or 30s . <p> " If you look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Scott Rowland , general counsel for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics , which prosecutes many meth cases . " There are a lot of remote areas that lend themselves to meth manufacturing . " <p> Now there is growing concern that meth 's appeal has begun to spread to college campuses and Midwest urban areas . <p> ' Like shooting fish ' <p> Nowhere in the Midwest is the meth problem more acute than here in Independence , Harry Truman 's hometown and now a city of 112,000 in the shadow of Kansas City . <p> The city 's drug enforcement unit has shut down 82 meth labs so far this year , a quarter of the state 's total . " Per capita , there 's more meth here than anywhere in the United States , " Jensen says . <p> There are so many labs in operation that police have turned to a tactic called " knock and talk " to gain access to suspicious sites without waiting for a search warrant . Detectives simply walk up to a suspected house , tell the occupants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they can look inside . Amazingly , four of five suspects let them in . <p> " It 's like shooting fish , " says detective Ron Franks , a burly officer with cropped hair . <p> Acting on a tip , Jensen and three detectives parked on Short Street near the wood-frame house with its sagging porch . As they got out of their cars , a woman pulled out of the driveway in a beat-up Chevy Blazer . The detectives followed her . <p> Three blocks from the house , they stopped her on a traffic violation . After a 10-minute conversation , police persuaded her to return to the house and let them in . In the home , which the woman first said was empty , police found three men in the basement surrounded by all the equipment needed to make meth . A fourth man was hiding in the attic . All five were arrested . Charges are pending the results of tests on three jars of liquid seized in the raid , which was legal because one of the occupants gave police permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even want to live in your own neighborhood any more , " says Yazel , who has raised four children during her 35 years on Short Street . <p> Meth carries with it the same sorts of crime problems that attend all addictive drugs , including higher burglary rates and violence . The large number of people arrested are crowding Midwest jails . And the mixing of volatile chemicals in the manufacturing process creates a fire and explosion hazard . <p> In a tragic case the day after Christmas in 1995 , three toddlers , ages 1 , 2 , and 3 were burned beyond recognition when a meth lab in their Riverside County , Calif. , trailer exploded . Studies by police in Western states have shown that as many as one of every four labs seized had signs of explosions and fires . <p> Noxious fumes also pose a health risk . Police wear respirators and protective clothing whenever they handle chemical evidence from a meth lab . A hazardous materials unit from the fire department must oversee lab clean-ups . <p> " It 's basically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI agent who runs the Jackson County Drug Task Force . <p> ' Dungeon of death ' <p> The spread of meth has become a huge community concern . When a local sales tax was about to expire two years ago , voters in the Kansas City metropolitan area agreed to extend it and use the money to help pay for the drug task force , community education programs and additional drug treatment facilities . In Oklahoma , the state has instituted a 40-hour training course for police that helps officers recognize the components of mom-and-pop meth labs that might otherwise be overlooked . The Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa has produced public service announcements showing an officer in toxic-waste gear searching a basement lab . A voice over describes the lab as a " filthy dungeon of death . " <p> Zilli Slaboda , who leads an epidemiology working group sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse , has studied drug use in 20 U.S. cities for three decades . The spread of meth into the Midwest is one of the clearest trends she has found . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its push eastward . <p> DEA statistics show no meth lab busts last year in the 14 states along the East Coast , but 12 labs were shut down in Pennsylvania . That 's the same number of labs seized in Missouri just three years ago .
