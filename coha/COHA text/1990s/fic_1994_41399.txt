Every summer she and her husband drive down to the country to spend time with her mother and grandmother . She looks forward to these visits , especially now that the children are grown and gone . No alarms , flailing limbs , and roller coaster emotions that require constant , patient tending . The time now has slow , rich , unclocked rhythms . She and her mother peel potatoes , shell peas , polish furniture . Or she sits through long , soft , blue summer evenings with her astringent old grandmother , half-listening to Grandma 's thin old-lady voice ( which sounds much like the fiddling of the crickets ) and half-listening to the silence beneath the country rustlings and creakings . Lately , Bill seems merely to tolerate these visits . He has acquired an aimlessness , sleeping in chairs and under trees , wandering around the yard ; and they always have to call his name three and four times before he answers . <p> " Nadine ! Nadine ! " Their mother 's voice pealed down from the second floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perched on the wooden porch banister , her eyes riveted down the block , did not answer . <p> " Nadine ! Nadine ! Come in here , I 'm calling you ! " <p> Eleanor pinched her sisters leg . " Answer her . Or she 's just gon na come get you ! " <p> Nadine snatched her leg away and heaved a huge , shoulder-rolling , neck-twisting sigh . She stumped to the door and yelled through the screen , " What ? " <p> " Do n't answer me ' what ' ! " <p> " Ma'am ? " <p> " I asked you to fold clothes earlier today and I come in here  --  " Their mother/s floating voice was coming closer and they could hear her heels thumping on the steps , so they knew she was coming down to them from the second floor . Nadine muttered , " Oh , damn ! " and Eleanor raised her brows . <p> " I come in here and find two baskets of clothes just like I took them off the line . Girl , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the screen door , hands on hips . <p> " Mom , can it wait ? Bill and Antoine and Shubby 're just now coming down the street with Sharon and Nika . I promised I 'd go to the store with them . I 'll fold clothes when I get back  --  " <p> " Who gave you permission to go ? " <p> " Mom , I 'm fourteen . It 's just around the corner  --  " <p> " I did n't say you could go . Who 'd you ask if it was all right for you to leave this house ? " <p> " Mom  --  " <p> " Get upstairs ! " <p> By this time Nadine 's friends had arrived , but they did n't greet her immediately . They stood uncertainly around the steps , familiar with Nadine 's quarrels with her mother and not wanting to draw her moths attention . Nadine 's mom had a way of looking at you that made you wish you were down the block and , possible , behind a big tree . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Deen fold clothes when she gets back . I was gon na ask her to buy me something . And Grandma said something earlier about a Co-cola . " <p> " Hey , Mrs. Andrews Nadine 's friends finally chorused . <p> " Hello . " Their mother gave Nadine 's friends her straight stare , then said to her older daughter , " Hold on , I want you to get me something . Let me get some money . " She left the doorway . <p> Nadine turned her monkey grin on her friends . " Hey , y'all . Let 's take the long way there . " <p> Bill looked at Eleanor . " You coming ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> Their mother came back with a list and a few dollar bills . Nadine grabbed the paper and the money and scampered down the steps . Eleanor watched her go . She really did n't want to go ; their father would be coming down the sidewalk soon , and she preferred to wait for him rather than trail along behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her along . But her father would rub his bristly cheek against hers and say , " Hey , sweets . " Eleanor liked what she was doing , sitting on the top step in the blue summer dusk , waiting ; and she saw no reason to go anywhere . Everything she wanted seemed to come to her . <p> Ellie is sitting on the steps when drive up to Mom 's and Grandma 's . I still ca n't believe Mom bought this old house in the country . Maybe she 's trying to relive her youth , because the house is two-storied like the house we grew up in , and has a large front porch and a flight of steps just like the ones Ellie end I used to sit on . The first things you see when you walk into Mom 's house are pictures of Dad and Granddad , eight-by-eleven studio portraits in gold-tone frames set on small tables on either side of the front door . The only men those two women ever knew , I guess . What they 've missed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's wearing a rose-colored sundress , the ruffled hem pulled around her ankles like she thinks she 's a little girl . No Bill in sight . I 'm glad . Bill is such a bore . <p> We arrive in late afternoon . The house faces west . Ellie with her dress , around her ankles sits in the low slanting light and it 's kind to her : She looks almost like we did when we were kids . Jerome steers the car off the dirt driveway , parks it under the big pecan tree , and we get out , saunter to the house . Ellie rises just as we reach the bottom of the steps . She looks down on us , puts out a hand . <p> " Hey , girl , " I say , " where 's old Bill ? This is Jerome . " I take her hand and it is warm . I come up the steps and bump her cheek with mine . " How 're things ? " <p> " Good to see you , Deen , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mourning dove 's calling from the woods in back of the house , deep and throaty . " Jerome . " She puts out her hand to Jerome and he takes it . Something passes between them . I do n't know what , but I know something does . However , Ellie has a way with young people . She 's a school teacher ( do n't know how she stands it ) , so maybe he 's responding to her schoolteacheriness . He does n't smile . He loosens his grip quickly . She steps aside . " Go on into the kitchen . Mama 's frying up enough chicken for a football team . " Her voice is full of amusement . <p> I take Jerome 's arm . " Come on . " <p> He seems to hesitate . Then he comes along . I pull him closer to me so we can go in the door together . <p> Bill watches from the shade of a moss-draped tree . A mockingbird is breaking out in short bursts of notes , running up the scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening song . Bill watches his wife in her sunset-colored dress , sees her bow her head , stroke the back of her neck , then turn and vanish into the house . <p> He 's not going in , oh no , not yet . Not until his mother-in-law has recovered from the shock of Nadine 's latest . From his clothes and walk , a young man . That 'd be like Nadine . He 'll wait out here in the peace , concentrate on the mockingbird and the mourning doves , on the scraping of grasshoppers in the dry field across the narrow dirt road . Red Georgia dirt . It is too quiet around here without the children . He misses their high-pitched shouts , their quarrels , screeching , and laughter . He knows that Eleanor does not miss the children these days when she is visiting her mother ; she likes being daughter in the house again relishes not being in the middle and pulled in a multitude of directions . However , he can not blame her . She is the best of mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respite . He stands staring at the spot were she had glowed in the sun , head bowed , slim brown hand touching the curve of her neck . Eleanor is beautiful . He is mystified that she married him , appears to love him , stays with him even though he is now getting old  --  cheeks sagging , belly sagging , hair receding . She still hugs him her sleep . <p> I love the look on Mom 's face . Jerome is just two year 's older than my oldest son . Her throat works : The struggle to be polite almost strangles her . Her eyes bulge . But I warned Jerome that my family might be difficult , so he holds out his hand and turns on that smile that makes women want to shimmy out of their pantyhose , and Mom shakes his hand , dazed . My baby is really something . <p> Ellie comes into the kitchen , starts taking dishes out of the cabinets . Jerome turns to look at her . Because he is company , we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chairs solid enough to seat elephants , pale blue wallpaper covered with these saucer-sized roses , and doilies everywhere . Ugh . The furniture is Grandma 's . <p> " Your rooms are ready , " says Ellie , tinkling silverware . " And the fresh towels 're the bathroom . Why do n't you-all freshen up ? Dinner 'll be on the table soon . " <p> I start to say that there wo n't be any need for " rooms , " just one room will do for me and Jerome , but , well ... why start a hassle ? There 's no law that says Jerome and I have to stay in our separate rooms after everybody else is snoring . I take Jerome 's arm . " Come on . " <p> She took her father 's arm , and they mounted the steps . He paused , stroked a post . " Got ta paint all this soon , " he sighed . " get Deen 's friends to help , " she giggled . <p> " They 're around all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand on the top of her head as if he wished to press down and keep her from growing any more . She tilted her head back , relishing the feel of her father 's huge , rough hand sliding down her braids . Then she butted him playfully . <p> " Come on , " said Eleanor , in her element , happy . " Mama 's fixed country-fried steak and mashed potatoes tonight . " <p> " Our favorite . " <p> " Ummmmmmm-hhmmmm ! " <p> He nodded slightly . His wife usually cooked something he really liked after they had had a quarrel . The word sorry seemed always to stick in her throat , so she said it with food  --  and hard , sharp little hugs in the dark . She was far from the laughing , swaggering girl he had married , the girl who sneaked out of her dorm room after hours , who bopped and smoked and could throw a fur piece around her shoulders with the high-handed flair of a Broadway actress . Hard times had hardened her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting combination . <p> " Come on , " said Eleanor , leading him through the door with her . <p> " Call Bill in , " says her mother , and Eleanor goes back to the front door and raises her voice . She finally sees him standing in the shade of the tree , a dapple of light on his sloping shoulders . She turns abruptly , back into the gloom of the house . Her body still pulses from the electricity that had arced between her and Jerome . <p> I 've been to this place before , and I never liked it , I still do n't like it , and I 'm not going to stand for it . Eleanor , raise your eyes from that plate , you ai n't fooling anybody ; it 's all pretense , is always been pretense ; you know what 's going on and , just like always , you 're going to do what you want , take what you please , to hell with anybody else- <p> Stupid Bill . Stupid , stupid Bill . Sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirts with another man , coming on to him just by sitting still and not doing anything . They all fell for that , hung around waiting for her to move . Most times it was into the house she went anyway , but they stayed on the porch waiting for her come out again while me , smiling , and Sharon and Nika posed and talked and tilted our heads ... but they look for Eleanor . Sweet little , nice little , **32;0;TOOLONG little Eleanor . My little sister Eleanor . <p> " It 's because she does n't swarm or clutch , " my father once said to me when I complained to him that Eleanor was stealing everybody 's boyfriends . I wanted to hit him . Stupid man . <p> " You coming ? " said Bill . " No , I 'm waiting , " she answered . He left with the others but trailed behind , looking back until Nadine grabbed his arm and yanked him into the group . <p> " I 'm going to have white hair , " thinks Eleanor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rippling down my neck and arms . My hands will be stick-thin and knobby . My back will bow . I will look like Grandma . He will still be upright and pretty , and the grey in his hair will be distinguished . " She looks up , skates her gaze away from Jerome 's dark , intent eyes . She meets her grandmother 's eyes . Grandma is toothlessly munching her soft vegetables , but those and her wrinkles a the only sot things about her .. Nadine 's voice is getting very shrill and gay . Mama 's voice is sharp . Jerome asks her to please pass the cornbread , and she proffers the china plate . His hand shakes slightly when he takes it . <p> Grandma orders me to sit with her in the living room . Jerome offers to help with the dishes  --  Mom does n't have a dishwasher , I cant see why not , she 's got enough money . Well . Mom 's in the kitchen with them , and she could cool down dogs in heat . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold eye . Mom 's eye like a scalpel searching for the tumor in you , the fault in you , the imperfection in you . Gon na cut it out and lay it on the table in public for anybody to see . No secrets from Mom . <p> What 's she gon na say to Eleanor , coming on to a man right under her husband 's nose , her own sister 's man , young enough to be her son ? <p> Bill walks down the dirt road in front of the house , in the mellow light of a full , rising moon . Fireflies blink yellow-green in the undergrowth . He hears click beetles . And crickets . He is walking fast and not looking back , not looking back to see if Eleanor is waiting . <p> Her mother leaves the kitchen for some reason , and Eleanor opens her mouth to call her back , then thinks , " This is silly . I 'm forty-two years old and this boy 's the same age as my oldest son . Nothing can happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes a dish from her to wipe with his terrycloth towel . He clears his throat again . " Nadine did n't say anything about how beautiful you are . " <p> Eleanor murmurs , " Thank you . But Deen ca n't brag on me without bragging on herself . We 're a lot alike . " This is not true . Less true now that Nadine has dyed a red-blonde patch in the top of her head , a patch gelled to stand straight up and the rest of her hair divided into terraced layers . Just like the young kids . Poor Nadine . She was never on time : always ahead , always behind , never where she wanted to be when she wanted to be there . Forty-five-year-old woman with red patches in her head . <p> Eleanor suddenly lifts her head and laughs . Nadine , my sister , Nadine . She 's something else ! " <p> Silence . Jerome is forgetting to rub the plate . Heat is growing between them , a pulling like tides , directional signals like sunflowers turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his arms around her , kissed her mouth . It was something like this . <p> Jerome says , " Mrs. Nelson  --  Eleanor  --  " <p> Eleanor . Eleanor . I know Jerome is thinking about Eleanor . " Nadine , look , I just feel funny with your mother and your grandmother so close , bet they can hear everything through the walls  --  " <p> That 's just an excuse . I know it is . I grab him , latch my arms around his neck . Please , Jerome , do n't push me away- <p> " Nadine  --  " <p> I push him away . Sob . Wipe at tears . My eyes dry up . I hiss . I tell him- <p> Grandma thumps on the wall . I hear her creaky voice , faint but plain : " Stop being a fool and let me get some sleep ! " <p> I freeze . <p> Jerome pushes at me . <p> I jump out of the bed , run , run from the house . <p> Bill , awake , feels Eleanor slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor as she searches for her slippers . He keeps his breathing quiet . She 's going to him , the handsome young man who wants her , whose wanting was like an undertow at the dinner table , thunder in the water , threat in the air- <p> No . She would not do that in her mother/s house . Nor to sister . Where is she going ? She is leaving him , she will walk away and not look back , leaving him waiting . <p> Beautiful woman . Rich with beauty , like a summer field under a full moon , silver light and grey shadows , grasses bowing under breaths of air , fireflies wining , the chirring of crickets , movement and stillness in one- <p> Eleanor goes . <p> Nadine comes . Racing down across the yard without any shoes on apparently , from the way she 's stumbling and hobbling , silly woman never would wait even to get what she needed to ward off hurt . <p> She is sobbing . Pulling at her hair . Very dramatic . Her thin gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through to her . <p> Jerome , poised on the front steps , can . <p> Bill lying in bed , looks out into the dark . <p> Grandmother sleeps . Her withered lips flutter . <p> Mother grits her teeth and remembers a fox-fur cape flying over her shoulders , trailing her as she climbs out of a college dormitory window into the arms of a young man whose latter-day face peers out of a golden frame set on a table just as you come into this house , and she wants him , wants him , wants him , remembers the pulling between them like undertows , heat growing between them , and she grits her teeth for her older daughter , whom she can see right through . <p> " Deen , stop it . " <p> Nadine 's head snaps up . Her voice is hoarse . " Bitch . Horny little bitch . What were you hoping , that he 'd somehow know you were out here ? Did you set it up in the kitchen doing dishes , plan to slip off down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shut up , Deenie . I was waiting for you . " <p> " You 're lying  --  " <p> " Deen , you 're not thinking . I was with Bill ; then I came out to wait for you . I knew you 'd come . " <p> " How could you know ? Oh , you just guessed Jerome would push me out the bed  --  " <p> " Not so hard to guess . Almost everybody 's got better manners and a sense of timing than you , Deenie . " <p> Her slippers a dew-soaked , so her feet are getting cold . Nadine 's bare feet must already be chilled . The hems of their gowns are wet . <p> Nadine croaks , " What 'd you say ? " <p> " You ' a fool Nadine . So 's Bill . So am I. Jerome 's just a randy kid ; he does n't count . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Come into the house . We 'll make tea . We 'll get warm . We 'll go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Do n't you know yet that this kind of thing passes . " <p> Nadine sobs . Eleanor puts out her hands , rubs her sisters goose-fleshed arms . " Fool . " Her voice is affectionate , soft as a mourning dove 's . " Take that child on back home . Sit still awhile . And stop picking on me . " <p> " You always got them when we were girls , always  --  " hiccups Nadine . <p> " Not all , " contradicts Eleanor , " just Bill . And you never really wanted him . " <p> " Only because he wanted me . You 're an idiot , poor Deenie , dear Deenie  --  " Eleanor is holding her sister and rocking her in the moonlight , steadying her shudders . <p> Nadine snuffles , " Oh , God . How 'd you get to be so perfect <p> " It 's easy to look perfect around you . All I have to do is sit still . You 're so busy bounding around , grabbing and pushing and yanking and rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Eleanor 's arm around Nadine 's shoulders , they walk back to the house . Their mother stands on the front steps . She gives her daughters her straight stare . <p> " Teapot 's on . " She pulls open the screen door of her country house . " What 'll we have , pound cake or toast ? " <p> No Nadine . No Jerome . Peace descends . Bill is walking away from her , not looking back , walking in the track of Nadine 's car . Nadine driving that child back to his place . Maybe she 'll even dye that stupid-looking red patch of hair back to its natural color . <p> " Bill ! " Eleanor calls . She has to call again . " Bill ! " He stops . She runs down the step across the yard . She wants to scold him for not trusting her , for being hangdog and absent when presence counted . She says , " Bill ! " <p> There are times when he has looked at her as if he were a man starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure spring water at a sudden oasis . For that she has always waited for him . Eleanor knows enough to give what she has been given , to offer what she hopes to keep . <p> She rubs his belly familiarly , leans her face against his chest . " Mama , " she says , her voice low , " Mama wants you to go into town and get some denture tablets for Grandma 's teeth . " <p> He shouts with laughter . Birds spring out of the trees into the morning sunlight . <p> He goes into the house , picks up his car keys and a list from his mother-in-law , who , for once , is not frowning at him . When he comes out of the house , his wife is sitting on the steps , denim skirt drawn around her ankles . He stands behind her , and she leans her head back against his legs . He looks down at her . Silver hairs glint in the dark cloud of her hair . Ambrosia and pure spring water . <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
