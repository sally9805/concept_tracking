<p> Thanksgiving at the Cheatham house in Indianapolis means many things . Family and football . Turkey and TV . Cranberry and cable . <p> Denver and Detroit . <p> That 's the first of three football games on TV Thursday , all of which likely will be on at Owen and Ernestine Cheatham 's house . That is , on the TV in the kitchen , and the one in the living room , and the one in the family room , too . <p> " We leave the TVs on while we eat , " says son Eric Cheatham cheerfully . " Watching football is a Thanksgiving tradition . But for me , really , any time there is sports on TV , my tradition is to watch it . " <p> Cheatham is not alone . He is an account executive at a personnel agency in Indianapolis , a city where watching sports on the tube is a way of life . <p> More people per capita watch sports on TV in the counties around Indianapolis than anywhere else in the USA , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consumer marketers , which also lists Presque Isle , Maine , as the region in which the smallest percentage of residents watches TV sports . <p> Dean Condon , a plumber and welder in Presque Isle , wo n't be watching TV Thursday . He wo n't even be home . He and a friend will be midway through a deer-hunting trip they take each year during Thanksgiving week . Maine 's hunting season ends the Saturday after Thanksgiving . <p> " The women do n't like it , " says Condon , who has lived for four years with Beverly Trombley . " They 'd rather we be home for a Thanksgiving meal . But it 's a yearly thing and I guess you could say by now they 're getting used to it . " <p> The same can be said of Charlene Cheatham , Eric 's wife . " I like some sports on TV , too , " she says . " Just not as much as Eric does . You know how it is on Thanksgiving . The men watch football and the women watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup will prevail in many homes across the USA . And it hardly seems to matter that Thursday 's games could be true Thanksgiving turkeys - a pair of less-than-stellar National Football League games on network TV and one mediocre college game on cable . <p> It starts with Denver ( 3-7 ) at Detroit ( 3-7 ) on NBC at 12 : 30 p.m . EST . Then it 's Washington ( 6-4 ) at Dallas ( 4-7 ) on CBS at 4 p.m . EST . And as if that 's not enough , West Virginia ( 4-6 ) is at South Carolina ( 5-5 ) on ESPN at 8 p.m . EST . <p> " It 's not like I have a particular interest in any of those teams , " says Cheatham . " It 's just that those are the games that will be on . So I guess those are the games we 'll watch . " <p> Cheatham , his wife and three children will join other siblings and cousins at his parents ' home - a symphony of familial fellowship and fine food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays . <p> But not all families are as happy as this one , points out Bill Beausay , president of the Academy of Sports Psychology International . " When families get together , there is always the potential for disaster , " he says . " If you just know you 're going to get into a fight with somebody , one way to avoid the possibility is to turn on the TV and get lost in football instead . " <p> Maybe so , but that does n't explain the scores of people who watch sports all week every week , not just on holidays . <p> Some hearty viewers start their marathon NFL Sundays with the pregame shows , followed by an NFL doubleheader ( including channel-switching ) , an hour of postgame highlights before the Sunday night cable game , which is followed by still more highlights - " just in case , " as Beausay wryly puts it , " you might have missed something . " <p> For the true fanatic , that can add up to a dozen hours of football . Imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of them watching a bloated pigskin bounce across plastic grass . <p> " Different strokes for different folks , " shrugs Maine 's Condon . " Me , I do n't understand that . I ca n't sit still long enough to watch any kind of game . I watch a little basketball occasionally , but that 's it . " <p> What ? Not even the Super Bowl ? Is that legal ? <p> " Well , I might watch some of it . I might not . There is just too much else to do . " <p> Especially in Presque Isle , which is in Aroostook County - Maine 's northernmost , biggest and least-populous county . " Around here you 've got to do things outdoors , " says Scott Hoffses , president of the Presque Isle Snowmobile Club , " or else there 's nothing to do . " <p> And so the people of Presque Isle hunt , fish , ice fish , snow ski , water ski and hike , says Bobbie Dow , executive director of the Presque Isle Area Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 placed Presque Isle on the bottom rung of TV sports viewing . " They must not have talked to my husband , " she laughs . <p> The Analyst does n't say no one in and around Presque Isle watches TV sports . It does say only 29.6% of the 30,454 households in the region watch much of it - last of the 212 markets surveyed . The Analyst arrives at its conclusions using market research from consumers . <p> Indianapolis is No. 1 ; 44% of the 862,770 households in the region watch sports on TV . Wheeling , W. Va. - Steubenville , Ohio and Zanesville , Ohio , virtually tied Indianapolis for first place , but The Analyst ranked Indy No. 1 because of its larger population . <p> Zanesville , about 50 miles east of Columbus , is known as the birthplace of cowboy novelist Zane Grey ( who was named for the city , not the other way around ) . " People around here love pro football , " says physician Dominic B. Brune . " They can follow the ( Cincinnati ) Bengals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball , too , all the sports . Me , I like golf . I hate to say it , but if it 's the U.S. Open or The Masters , I 'll watch the whole thing . " <p> Watching the whole thing , no matter the sport , is becoming a national addiction . Beausay , the sports psychologist , thinks he knows why . <p> " In America , the big drive is success , " he says . " That means wealth , fame and glory . With sports , it is so easy to identify with the people who play . You get wealth , fame and glory and you get it all in three hours . What a deal ! <p> " It 's not possible to watch sports without choosing sides , and if you watch and your team wins , that 's a high . You get a feeling of real success without having to work or sweat for it . Now , that 's next to heaven , is n't it ? " <p> Indy 's Eric Cheatham thinks so . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Saturday and maybe three pro games on a Sunday - " nine hours , " he says , " like a whole work day . " <p> ESPN will air more than 200 college basketball games this season . Plenty of National Basketball Association games are on network and cable TV , including Indiana Pacers games on Cheatham 's local TV . " I can get a basketball game just about every night of the week , " he says . " Once college starts , it 's serious . Sometimes I watch two or three games at once - the power of remote control . " <p> Add the football on weekends and the basketball on weekdays and Cheatham figures he watches maybe 25 or 30 hours of sports on TV in a given week . <p> " That sounds like a lot when you add it all up , " he says . " But it does n't seem like so much when you take it a game at a time . " <p> See that ? Eric Cheatham watches so much sports he 's even beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game a time . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC Time to feast : TV and turkey <p> More people around Indianapolis watch sports on TV than anywhere else in the USA , according to The Lifestyle Market Analyst 1990 .
