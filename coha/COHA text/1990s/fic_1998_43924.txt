IT SEEMS MARGARET HAS BEEN in the kitchen since the beginning of time . Since sunlight she 's been cooking-kneading dough for bread , chopping , slicing , measuring out her day on the big oak counter next to the stove . Every few minutes she stops and scribbles ideas on a yellow pad with a grease pencil . The manuscript for Margaret 's second book , Voyages of the Dinner Table , is due in Birmingham in two days . The book is a kind of gastronomic history with some new creations thrown in , and she is trying to make sure the recipes are perfect before they reach Ann H. Hardy , her editor . <p> Margaret can prepare nine recipes at once , but it makes her feel more like a juggler than a cook : moving from notebook to cutting board , board to skillet , to oven and back to the cutting board again . By the end of the month the book will have traveled from the desk of Ann H. Hardy into the test kitchens of Southern Progress Publications , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed out any dishes they find overcomplicated , irreproducible , or " esoteric . " That was the word Ann H. Hardy used to describe five entrees that did n't make the final cut for The Ashevillian , Margaret 's first book . <p> But Margaret is n't worried about tests now ; she 's put the corporate kitchens out of her mind . She is summoning all her powers to prepare one of the most " esoteric " dishes in the new book . She is going to make Chocolate Duck . <p> She begins by pouring two cups of red wine and two cups of beef stock into a saucepan , then waits for the mix to simmer . While she waits , she pours herself a glass of wine . Wine is something of a hobby for her husband , Dan . He had the carpenter make a rack that stretches all the way around the kitchen , just shy of the ceiling , atop Margaret 's cabinets ; he got the idea from a magazine . The rack accommodates over two hundred bottles of wine , cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley mostly ; a couple of the Italians are worth something . Sometimes she wonders if keeping them here is a good idea : they 're too high , and exposed to heat . Dan likes the look of them , though . He says they look like soldiers , all lined up like that . The dark smell of warm beef and wine makes Margaret think of blood . It reminds her of the Victorian ladies in their corsets and petticoats who used to stroll to the slaughterhouse every afternoon for a fresh glass of it . In the nineteenth century , doctors told housewives that drinking blood staved off consumption . The glass of wine stays on the counter . Margaret would not have made a very good Victorian . There is something too equestrian about the way she moves through the kitchen . She does n't bake bread so much as command it to rise and brown . <p> Margaret comes from a long line of good cooks . She gets her talent from her mother , and her grandmother before her , who came to Asheville to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Margaret also got her curly black hair from her mother 's side of the family ; she has not cut it short like most women in their forties . Dan likes this . He likes the fact that his wife looks ten years younger than most of his friends ' wives , or at least he used to notice things like that . <p> Right now Dan is with his mistress-his new car-a used Jaguar with fifty thousand miles on the odometer . He spends most of his free time driving recklessly around the neighborhood , trying not to run over the ducks that wander off the nearby golf course into the road . Dan and Margaret 's house is just off Charlotte Street , across from the eighth hole . The country club is well-to-do , and known for its aquatic fowl : mallards , geese , even five or six stately swans with clipped wings that swim on the ponds amid all that immaculate green . Dan has given up golf for the car . Before the Jag , he drove an Accord to the office and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an early anniversary present and bought himself the Jag . He goes for a drive every day after work , most of the time without a word for her before he leaves . <p> Margaret pulls out a long , sharp knife and slices open a plastic bag of dried figs . She begins to halve the fruit . They look like mummified lips ; with each cut an ancient , lurid smile creeps out at her . She pauses , the knife poised an inch above the cutting board . Today is her twenty-third wedding anniversary , and just now she is caught in a moment of reflection . Reading with her fingers the cuneiform of the wooden board , an artifact passed down from mother to daughter , Margaret moves back in time . She sees the spice caravans of Mesopotamia , the cradle of the dinner table-serpentine lines curving between the Tigris and Euphrates . Camels heavy-laden with saffron and thyme are sailing through the desert toward her and the other anxious wives waiting on the edge of Ur . <p> Sometimes Margaret wanders the Attic fish markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not-logic breaks down on an empty stomach . Bearded men pry into the secrets of the heavens , but not one of them has invented a philosophy to teach us how to eat well . Prostitutes are moonlighting by the wharf , selling raw , bleeding tuna . The girls ' complexions remind Margaret of spoiled oysters . <p> When Margaret daydreams , she never becomes someone else ; rather , she recasts herself in similar roles in various settings . In Athens she is an aristocrat , her husband a powerful rhetorician . His funeral oration for their son has left the citizens numbed and dazed with grief . The entire city-state is in mourning . Not far from the market , merchant ships are slipping into the distance like old friends . The cold blue Aegean crashes on the coast . <p> Margaret and Dan 's son , John , died four summers ago , drowned in the undertow off Cape Hatteras , where they had built a cabin in Rodanthe . John was only a few feet away , waving at his mother , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring him back like a damaged letter , his body found by renters in the aftermath of a nor'easter . Waiting through the storm to look for John had been hard enough , but when he was found and Margaret was n't allowed to see him , she became hysterical . The seventy-mile-per-hour winds and the violent surf had made the body endure terrible things . Dan had to force Margaret into the car to get off the island . She tasted sand all the way home . <p> " Damn . " Margaret reprimands herself for not paying attention . She adjusts the gas under the wine , which has slipped from simmer into boil . The flames retract like cat 's claws . Margaret smiles ; she loves this stove . Gas allows for more precision than electric . The stove has a nineteenthcentury cast iron design , but the features are pure twenty-first : built-in griddle , two ovens , wok rings , six burners . Each burner is shaped like a star-eight radial fingers instead of the old , round eye . They provide even heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The liquid settles . She places the figs in the pan-they blossom . Margaret preheats the oven . <p> In a few moments she makes her way to the refrigerator and fetches the duck . It has already been decapitated , plucked , and placed in a mesh net . Margaret makes short work of the net with a knife . Then she takes two bowls from the cabinet . One she fills with flour . Next to the stove are glass jars filled with staples : bulk peppercorns , sugar , salt . She pours peppercorns into the Turkish coffee-grinder . It is old , nobody knows how old ; it 's one of the items that made the trip across the Atlantic with Margaret 's grandmother , all the way from Santorini , a Greek island in the Cyclades . The grinder is over a foot tall and made of solid brass ; it is heavy with family mythology . Like the cutting board , it was given to her when she married . It is strong enough to crush bones into flour . Margaret grinds out four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she reaches back into the cabinet . There is a little girl on the package , holding an umbrella in one hand and a cylinder of salt in the other . Margaret pours an equal amount of salt into the pepper bowl and then fills the glass container . Before she puts the salt away she examines the package again . Inside the little girl 's hands is another little girl , presumably holding salt . Margaret gets drunk trying to count all the little girls who live in her cabinet . <p> The duck 's flesh is smooth , ugly , discolored like a newborn baby . Its cavity is filled with rich fat . After dusting her right hand with flour , she spends about ten minutes ripping this out with her fingers . While she does this , she tries to imagine how the recipe will look in print . <p> Chocolate Duck <p> Dinner for two <p> sixteen-ounce package of dried figs , halved cups beef stock or canned beef broth <p> 2 cups dry red wine <p> 1 five- to seven-pound duck <p> 1 orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 tbsp. salt <p> 4 tbsp. pepper <p> 4 bay leaves <p> 6 tablespoons Armagnac or Hennessy cognac <p> 1 tablespoon butter <p> 2 squares Ghirardelli or other quality semisweet chocolate , halved <p> Ducks were the first domesticated fowl . The Chinese kept them in little huts , like henhouses , over four thousand years ago . Maybe because of the birds ' long history of domesticity , the Chinese say that eating duck keeps lovers faithful . There are recipes for roast duck in both the Ancient Greek cooking guide The Deipnosophist , <p> " The Banquette of the Wise , " and in many of the household records of the Egyptian pharaohs . But it is in the medieval Forme of Curey that we find the definitive method . Duck should be stuffed with sweets : apples , raisins , prunes , quince , figs , sugar , and/or honey are all excellent ingredients for accenting the meat 's rich flavor . <p> After the invention of the printing press , the Forme of Curey and other cooking guides were second only to the Bible in popularity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to be at table . If serving duck to the king , a host might want to shred orange rind over the bird 's skin , then pour a jigger or two of brandy on the platter and set it aflame . Of course , they did n't have chocolate in the Dark Ages , which is one of the reasons they were dark .... <p> " Well , there 've been projects like this before , " Ann H. Hardy had said on the phone a few months earlier . " Of course we 'll give it a shot , but The Ashevillian had regionalism on its side , and that 's really Southern Progress 's bread and butter . " <p> The Ashevillian was written in a matter of days soon after Margaret finished college . She entered UNC-Asheville after John died ; Shakespeare seemed cheaper than psychoanalysis . She took twenty-one hours every semester and went summers . After graduation , she wrote poems filled with handsome drowned boys . At night John appeared to her in dreams , with his fair hair and wet blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand civilizations under the ocean they could have seen together had she only caught his hand in time . She would write this all down in the morning , but when she was done her handwriting looked frail and pathetic . She never showed anyone . <p> Dan took to staying up drinking wine and brandy until long after his wife went to bed . He looked like Dan , acted like Dan , same big arms and shy smiles , but he ignored her . She persuaded him to come to bed early once , but when he complied it was as if John 's corpse were under the sheets with them . Now Dan wanders around the house at odd hours of the night like a ghost , bumping into furniture . <p> She saw the ad in Southern Living for a first cookbook contest , and decided to write down the old recipes and her mother 's stories about the wild life she 'd led in Asheville . Margaret wrote about the time George Patton stayed in the hotel and showed her mother his ivoryhandled .45s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he came to visit Zelda in the loony bin . At the time , the Asheville Asylum was one of the best in America ; it occupied a nineteenth-century cobblestone mansion only a mile from Charlotte Street . The hotel and restaurant business was nothing if not interesting , but Margaret had never liked it much . Her mother was rarely home ( her father died before she was born ) , and she was often alone . <p> The Ashevillian won the $1,000 first prize and sold 10,000 copies in the Southeast alone . It was going into paperback , and the publisher gave her a $12,000 advance and a two-book deal . The first book had been easy , just a matter of putting onto paper things she 'd known all her life ; but Voyages of the Dinner Table she had researched like a term paper . It was exhausting , and she had to write with the additional burden of knowing that her editor was n't overly enthusiastic about it . <p> Margaret cleans the duck fat from under her fingernails with a toothpick . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know list . Margaret never met a fact she did n't like . Fact #31 : Witches were said to smear cooked baby fat on their broomhandles to give them the power of flight . Fact #32 : In the sixteenth century , tobacco was often called the " dry drink " and was served after dinner in place of alcohol . Margaret finds herself fatigued and wanting a cigarette , a habit she refuses to give up-there no longer seems a reason . But she will have to hold out until she gets the duck in the oven . <p> She begins massaging the mixture of salt and pepper into the bird 's flesh , inside and out . She 's a bit disgusted by the slickness on her hands , and she stops to wash them with steaming water and dishwashing liquid , but they wo n't come clean . She scrubs until it feels as if the meat will fall away from the bones , but her fingers are still sticky . She gives up . She goes to the refrigerator again and takes out an onion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , perfectly round , a reliable fact like the speed of light . Margaret remembers a lot of tidbits from high school . The Earth is approximately twenty-five thousand miles in circumference ; to find the circumference of a circle , multiply the radius squared by pi . Margaret divides the orange at its equator . It falls apart . The problem with facts is that they are meaningless in and of themselves . A fact that stands alone is devoid of value ; you have to understand everything to make one fact worth something . You always have to keep yourself asking why . <p> Margaret massages the duck with half of the orange . Dan is out there , on the road . He 's wearing his aviator shades . The top is down . Maybe he 's fighting his way up Black Mountain , or trying to find a long straightaway so he can get the Jag up to eighty , ninety , one hundred . He might even be risking his life trying to hug the sheer curves between here and Knoxville . That 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car farther and farther , as if he were an explorer preparing for a long expedition , testing the ship , testing his own endurance . Margaret milks the orange for its last drop of juice . <p> She puts the other hemisphere of orange inside the cavity of the duck . The fruit 's puckered navel reminds her of maternity . She can recall every storybook she ever read to John . She finds it hard to remember what she did with herself before he was born . Dan had been a successful architect in Asheville for years before John 's birth . They moved to Knoxville while Dan studied at the University of Tennessee , and she 'd put him through school by waiting tables . She hated the work ; he worshiped her for it because he knew it was a sacrifice , all those loveless soups and entrees meant for strangers . It made her feel like her mother , alone and sucking up to the public for tips . <p> Anonymity-that was one of the real difficulties in writing a cookbook . How do you cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less kissed or made love to ? How do you put yourself into your food ? That is the question . The Knoxville ordeal was soon over , and Dan got a good job . He designed the two-story Tudor they live in now with the massive kitchen just for her , the big house Margaret always wanted . And for a time this was enough . <p> Then came motherhood , which was frightening-not just the physicality of it , the moods , the cravings , the nausea ( sometimes she still feels phantom pains of John 's skull pushing into her spine ) , but the awesome , holy responsibility of it all . Baby John warmed her heart when he nursed , but at the same time that blind , gnawing mouth made her fear for her life . And when he slept , he slept so quietly . Children always seem like little strangers when they 're sleeping , and this made Margaret feel like a pretender as a mother . She told Dan this once , and he laughed at her , but that was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John as dead . It seems more like he 's asleep in another room of the house . <p> Through all this , neither Dan nor Margaret has ever mentioned divorce , and this has given her a little hope , though she can tell there 's something sad and dangerous growing inside her husband , waiting to manifest itself . Something that stems from never having had the opportunity to say good-bye to their son , to weep over his body , to touch his little hand inside the coffin . Their lives are like the cabin in Rodanthe , which just sits there by the edge of the cold ocean , boarded up and haunted , waiting for the next hurricane . <p> Five months ago , the country club called . The greenskeeper ordered Margaret to come pick up her husband , who was drunk and causing a disturbance . Dan had clubbed a swan to death with a pitching wedge . By the time Margaret made it around the block , Dan had disappeared . Margaret did n't try to offer an explanation , and the greenskeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the world , and was a man not without pity . " Please , ma'am , " he said . " Please , ma'am . We ca n't have this . Keep him at home , whatever you have to do ; do n't let him come back . If he comes back , we 'll have to press charges . " <p> While Margaret minces the onion , she ponders the Middle Ages . Castles , cathedrals , flowing tapestries , knights fighting dragons . John used to tell her he thought a dragon lived inside Black Mountain . The dragon must be very old now , his ancient scales aching . He wishes a knight would come along and kill him ; it would be indecorous to die of old age . Only he is afraid there are no knights left . <p> Even as a girl Margaret appreciated fine things , maybe because her mother never had many . Crystal , china , elegant platters-Margaret has a gift for pageantry , has mastered the art of arrangement . Always after setting the table she is overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , Dan and Margaret are going to a play . They are benefactors of the UNC-A theater , and they receive season tickets . Tonight 's performance is A Midsummer Night 's Dream , one of her favorites-the fairies are so courtly ; the confusion is so well-framed . But it 's getting late , and Dan still is n't back . <p> Margaret wonders to what extent her life with Dan has been staged . Mother , father , wife , husband : the family cast just roles for halfhearted actors . After they built the golf course even the house did n't seem real ; the country club turned the neighborhood into an amusement park . But Dan was happy because it increased the property values . Margaret thinks about all her friends who got divorced and moved west . Strangers live in their houses . Zelda Fitzgerald 's grand asylum was turned into a realestate office . It seems to Margaret , at forty-three , that even real estate is n't very real anymore . In a way even John seems like an actor playing a corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the kitchen table , surrounded by silver , his hands crossed under the candles . <p> Margaret puts the onion inside the duck with the orange and adds four bay leaves . The onion 's vapor will make the duck succulent ; the orange 's sugar will caramelize and sweeten the onion . Margaret punctures the duck 's flesh with a skewer and puts it in the oven . Everything is almost ready . Richard II 's Compound Sallet , garnished with rose petals and marigolds , chills in the fridge , and Beauvilliers ' SeventeenthCentury Cheese Souffle is on the counter . Cream almond pastries , darloy , or maids in waiting are for dessert . In ten minutes Dan will either walk through the door with flowers or he wo n't come back at all . She sees his car smoldering on the side of the road , safety glass shattered like teeth around Dan 's dead body . She wonders what she would do with his clothes . <p> Margaret drinks a glass of wine and smokes . The smoke makes her feel sad . She feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she can only picture herself in sepia tones . <p> All that 's left are the figs , cognac , and chocolate . The sauce has reduced to only a cup or so . Margaret pushes the movie out of her head and goes back to work . Over the sink she strains out the figs , which will be served on the side ; she saves the rich liquid , returns it to the pan and pours in another glass of wine . With a wooden spoon she rubs the pan to deglaze the caramelized sugar on the bottom . She walks into the living room , where Dan keeps the Hennessy behind the bar . This is what he drinks when he 's up late . He thinks that just because it 's expensive he is a connoisseur and not a drunk . <p> She goes back into the kitchen and pours six teaspoons into the sauce . Then she adds butter and flour to make it thicken . Now the final touch : the chocolate , semisweet gourmet chocolate . She eats a square . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret picks up her knife to halve the wafers of chocolate before she adds them to the sauce . She is going to split the squares down the middle . On the cutting board she holds one between her forefinger and thumb . <p> Ahhh ! the sorrow of a sliced thumb . Blood spills onto the grooves of the board . In a strange way Margaret likes this , to have a little blood flow reminds her she 's still alive . The cut is deep . There is blood on her apron and on her dress . Blood glints on the foil . She sucks her thumb , and her mouth fills with copper . <p> She balls her fist and squeezes blood into the sauce . " For salt , " she says aloud , and then begins to stir in the chocolate . When it has melted , the pan takes on rare depth . She is trying to find her image in the liquid . Instead she sees the Jag . Dan is driving toward the ocean , accelerating toward Hatteras , the abandoned cabin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bathroom-for gauze , a towel , somethingbut she does n't . The whole universe swirls about the blue flames of the stove . <p> By the time she picks up the legal pad and the grease pencil , she has already composed the recipe in her head . She writes with purpose , knows as the pencil graces the page that the prose is succinct , clear , flawless . She will show them ; before she is done she will show the interns and strangers in the test kitchen a recipe fit for kings . She will give them the recipe for swan . <p> This has been simmering in her head for a while , ever since Dan brought home the great white swan he slaughtered . It was a long time before he came back to the house that day . Margaret sat in the kitchen for hours , waiting . She was horrified when he lurched in cradling the enormous bird . The greenskeeper had n't told her that Dan would n't let it go , that he 'd been holding it all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , there was blood on his shirt , and somehow there was even blood in his hair . He sat down on the floor like a little kid with the bird in his lap and wept . Margaret knelt beside him and cried too . The swan 's beak was crushed ; its broken neck dangled straight down . It had bright eyes . She had not known swans were so large . Then she made a mistake ; she tried to take it away from him . For a long time they struggled on the floor . But he held on , clutching the bird to his chest with his big arms , refusing to give it up . In the end there was just no way Margaret could take it away from him , and there was just no way he was letting go of the dead thing between them . <p>
