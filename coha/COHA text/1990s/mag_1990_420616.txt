Section : YOUR FINANCES In an exclusive MONEY study of congressional voting records , we identify the members who stand up for your financial interests  --  and those who do n't . <p> Between now and Nov. 6 , the legislators running for reelection to Congress will be making self-serving campaign speeches , shaking hands , making self-serving campaign speeches , kissing babies , making self-serving campaign speeches and , of course , asking you to vote for them . But before you cast your ballot , be sure to ask yourself this : When it comes to the economic issues that directly affect your wallet , have the people you sent to Washington , D.C. been voting for you ? <p> This exclusive 12-page report , prepared with the assistance of Legi-Slate Inc. , a Washington , D.C. firm that tracks congressional votes , will give you the answers . Starting on page 131 ) , you will find our complete state-by-state listing of all 533 members of the 101st Congress  --  the House seats of New Jersey 's James Florio and Hawaii 's Daniel Akaka were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their votes cast on 27 key personal-finance and economic issues between January 1989 and August 1990 . <p> We do n't merely record each member 's votes . We show you whether they reflected the views of a majority of MONEY subscribers polled on each issue by the Gallup Organization in late July . To round out our 1990 personal-finance voter 's guide , we also award each member of Congress an overall grade  --  A to F  --  to tell you at a glance how well your representatives are sticking up for you . ( A detailed description of all the votes on which the grades were based begins on page 126 . ) And , oh yes , President Bush gets rated as well , on page 127 . <p> So , how did the legislators stack up ? Obviously , it depends on your point of view and , naturally , votes on money matters alone should not be the only standard for evaluating a legislator this fall . Still , here are some facts : Only two legislators-Republican House members Constance Morella ( Md. ) and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 we graded aced our test by voting exactly as the majority of MONEY subscribers we polled would have done on every issue . Not a single senator got a perfect score , though two  --  Democrats Howard Metzenbaum ( Ohio ) and Dennis DeConcini ( Ariz. )  --  missed by just one vote . <p> In all , 15 members of the House and two senators got an A in our grading system , which approximates a standard bell curve and was reviewed by John A. Paulos , a Temple University mathematics professor and author of Innumeracy ( Random , $7.95 ) . There were 150 Bs , 250 Cs and 89 Ds . At the bottom of our rankings , 13 House members and two on the Senate side rated Fs . <p> The ratings showed some surprisingly clear distinctions by party too . Democrats handily outperformed Republicans , with 42% earning As or Bs vs. just 18% of G.O.P. members . And while 36% of Republicans scored a D or an F , only 9% of the Democrats got Ds and none flunked . Only one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an explanation of his votes . Said Representative Bob Stump ( R , Ariz . ) : " I can not help but believe that your readers and I are not as far apart as your survey may indicate . " ( For profiles of our top- and bottom-scoring legislators , see page 128 . ) <p> Before jumping ahead to see whether your representatives came out looking like heroes or zeros , you should understand how we arrived at our ratings . First , we scanned all recorded roll-call votes to identify the ones with the most significance for MONEY readers ' financial well-being . There was no shortage of votes to choose from . Since the 101st Congress convened a year ago last : January , the house and Senate have recorded votes on 1,252 trills , amendments and motions . That total includes votes on some so-called commemoratives  --  measures and resolutions of such vital national importance as declaring the week of Dec. 3 , 1989 as National Pay Telephone Week and Nov. 22 , 1990 as National Wild Turkey Day . <p> We specifically looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , the votes on a capital-gains tax cut could mean more cash for investors . Similarly , congressional decisions regarding the S &L; bailout will help determine how much each taxpayer will fork over for the thrift debacle . We also included votes with broader economic impact such as the Clean Air Act reauthorization and the Civil Rights Act of 1990 . To identify key votes on issues with competing motions and amendments , we relied on a consensus of consumer and business lobbies and on Congressional Quarterly , a weekly journal . <p> Occasionally , crafty legislative procedures prevented us from analyzing critical votes . For example , although the Senate took a roll-call vote on an earlier , less controversial version of the S &L; bailout bill , we could not rate the senators on the final version . Reason : they weaseled out of going on record by approving the bill through a standing vote  --  basically a show of hands in which the lawmakers ' positions are not recorded . Even more galling , only 21 senators showed up to vote . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make $98,400 now ) , had already deserted the Capitol and the capital to get an early start on their monthlong summer recess . <p> To find out what positions MONEY subscribers would have taken on the votes we selected , we asked the Gallup Organization to conduct a telephone poll of a randomly chosen , statistically representative sample of 300 readers . ( The poll has an error range of plus or minus six percentage points . ) We then labeled as the correct vote whichever side of an issue drew the support of 51% or more of our sample . Incidentally , we also asked subscribers whether they favored forcing Congress to use roll-call votes on important legislation like the S &L; bill . Their reply was an unequivocal yes : 94% of respondents supported requiring roll-call votes . <p> Here is a brief demographic profile of our poll 's respondents , 92% of whom say they plan to vote in November : 41% are Republicans , 18% are Democrats , 34% are independents or registered with another party , 7% are not registered . 68% are men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $50,000 a year . <p> Roughly a third are under age 40 , another third between 40 and 54 , and another 54 and up . <p> 85% own homes and 43% have children under 21 . <p> In the state-by-state tables , legislators get a star ( * ) when they voted with the MONEY majority ; when the positions differed , the members get a zero ( 0 ) . House members with 12 or more stars scored an A , 10 or 11 a B , eight or nine a C , six or seven a D , and those who got five or fewer correct votes got the old flunkeroo , a big F. The Senate had a slightly different scale because we used one fewer vote there : A , 11 stars ; B , nine or 10 ; C , seven or eight ; D , five or six ; and F , four or fewer . <p> Of course , MONEY subscribers are not a monolithic voting bloc , and your views may differ from those of the majority of readers . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and determine your own grades . <p> We had to exclude two important votes from our ratings because subscribers were evenly divided on them . On 1990 's controversial Family and Medical Leave Act ( passed by Congress but vetoed by President Bush ) , 49% of respondents supported and 49% opposed the bill , which sought to require that many employers grant employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for medical reasons . ( A closer breakdown shows some decidedly differing opinions among subscribers . While 58% of women supported the bill , only 45% of men did . Also , 65% of Republican respondents were against the legislation but 64% of Democrats were for it . ) Similarly , on a vote to phase out child-care tax credits and flexible spending dependent-care accounts for families with household incomes above $70,000 , 49% favored phasing out the credits and 48% opposed changing the law . We have listed each politician 's vote on these two issues , however , so you can see how your representatives sided . <p> Ultimately , informing you about Congress ' votes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or misdeeds  --  is more important than any grades we assign . Paul Beckner , who heads the Congressional Reform Project for the watchdog group Citizens for a Sound Economy , says bluntly : " Unless you have someone outside of Washington looking over their shoulder , history shows that Congress will run amok . " <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY WALTER L. UPDEGRAVE <p> Illustration by Milton Glaser <p> PRESIDENT BUSH PULLS DOWN A GENTLEMAN 'S " B " <p> Although his lips have slipped on taxes , President Bush still gets high marks for siding with MONEY subscribers on a recent set of important congressional votes . Of the 10 personal-finance and economic votes on which President Bush took a public stand , his views coincided with MONEY subscribers ' opinions eight times . Extrapolating from that 80% ratio , the President would have earned a B in our grading system  --  not good enough to make him First Consumer Advocate but a respectable showing nonetheless . In fact , the President 's grade was better than that of 354 Republicans and Democrats we graded . <p> We determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal that tracks the White House 's position on legislation . The President was n't rated on eight votes because he never made his position clear enough . As with our congressional ratings , we did n't score Bush on two family-issue votes because our readers ' opinions were evenly divided on them . For the record , however , the President vetoed the Family and Medical Leave Act because he says the government should not mandate private companies ' employee benefits . He also opposed a child-care bill that , among other things , would phase out tax credits and flexible spending accounts for families earning between $70,000 and $90,000 a year . <p> The President 's agreement with MONEY subscribers on the pocketbook issues may come as little surprise . As you would expect , he pushed to cut the capital-gains tax rate , a move consistent with his family 's Wall Street background : his father , former Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush , was a partner in the private investment banking firm Brown Bros . Harriman . Bush also lobbied intensely for the thrift bailout bill and supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed two other bills heavily favored by MONEY subscribers : the 1990 Clean Air Act reauthorization and legislation requiring balanced federal budgets . <p> Bush parted ways with MONEY readers on two votes . He vetoed an increase in the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 an hour , claiming it would take jobs away from the low-skilled workers the bill was intended to protect . ( He later signed an increase to $4.25 an hour , though . ) Also , the President has threatened to veto the recently passed Civil Rights Act of 1990 , claiming it could lead to hiring quotas . <p> A SPOTLIGHT ON CONGRESS ' WINNER AND SINNERS <p> Our review of the 533 current House and Senate members turned up only four unqualified winners . Well , almost . To be precise , two representatives scored a perfect 13 stars in our study of voting records . No senators were flawless , though two earn our highest designation by agreeing with MONEY subscribers 11 out of 12 times . The four winners  --  three men and one woman , two from each political party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all Republican men , all staunch conservatives  --  who voted counter to the views of our subscribers nearly every time . The names of the 24 other members of Congress who rated As and Fs are listed in the footnote below . THE WINNERS <p> Representative Constance Morella ( R , Md . ) . A former English professor from affluent Montgomery County , Morella , 59 , aced our test . Depending on your politics , this two-term incumbent is a party turncoat or fierce independent . Last year she voted against the Republican position 76% of the time , more than any other G.O.P. member . A liberal on social issues , Morella earned high ratings from left-of-center groups but also got a good grade from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 1989 . <p> Representative James Walsh ( R , N.Y. ) . The only first-termer on our winners list , Walsh , 43 , also got a perfect score . The representative from the Syracuse region generally takes a moderate line on social issues and a pro-business stance on economic ones such as the capital-gains tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal , a marketing executive for the regional telephone company Nynex and president of the Syracuse city council for two years . <p> Senator Howard Metzenbaum ( D , Ohio ) . The Senate 's resident firebrand , Metzenbaum , 73 , sided with MONEY subscribers in all but one instance : he voted against a capital-gains tax cut , contending the cut would mainly help the rich . Throughout his three terms , the senator from suburban Cleveland has consistently taken a pro-labor , anti-big-business stance . Within Washington , he is known  --  even feared  --  for his feisty , confrontational style in a body noted for courtly manners on the floor and back-scratching behind the scenes . His favorite tactic : zapping special-interest giveaways buried in large , complicated bills such as the 1986 tax-reform legislation . Though he cherishes his watchdog role , Metzenbaum has also had to defend his integrity . In 1983 , he took a $250,000 finder 's fee in the sale of a Washington , D.C. hotel . After some media attention , he returned the money , insisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D , Ariz . ) . A former Arizona district attorney and 14-year congressional veteran , DeConcini , 53 , earned our A grade by disagreeing with MONEY subscribers just once : he voted to raise the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) mortgage limit to 95% of an area 's median house price rather than cap the increase at $124,875 . But some of DeConcini 's activities off t he Senate floor have gotten him the most attention  --  and criticism-recently . He is currently being investigated by the Senate ethics committee as one of the " Keating Five "  --  the senators who intervened with federal S &L; regulators in 1987 on behalf of Charles Keating , then chairman of the Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. , parent of the now bankrupt Lincoln Savings &; Loan . The Arizona Democrat strongly denies any wrongdoing , saying he merely went to bat for a constituent and major employer in his state . THE SINNERS <p> Representative Bob Stump ( R , Ariz. ) leads our list of legislative losers . A 14-year House veteran from outlying Phoenix , Stump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a possible 13 votes . Originally a Democrat , Stump switched allegiances in 1982 . Last year , he voted the Republican line 96% of the time . Stump is considered to be one of the Pentagon 's most reliable supporters . Extremely popular among his constituents , he ran unopposed in 1986 and in 1988 won with a landslide 69% of the vote . <p> Representative Richard Baker ( R , La . ) . Just behind Stump , with only four stars , Baker , 42 , switched from the Democratic party in 1985 . He has represented most of Baton Rouge and its suburbs since 1986 . Baker 's local popularity is based less on ideology than on catering to constituents and making sure his district gets its share of federal funds . <p> Senator Jesse Helms ( R , N.C. ) flunked our test by taking the MONEY subscribers ' side on only four issues : the two FHA votes , the capital-gains tax cut and Medicare catastrophic-care repeal . Ultraconservative Helms , 68 , voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1990  --  a stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the black former mayor of Charlotte , tries to unseat the three-term incumbent . <p> Senator Steve Symms ( R , Idaho ) , 52 , who voted on our issues exactly as did Helms , was the only senator in 1988 to get a perfect rating from the American Conservative Union and goose eggs from the AFL-CIO and Americans for Democratic Action . In 1979 , he reportedly invested in silver futures while co-sponsoring legislation that could have helped him as an investor . A spokesman said Symms ' investments pose no conflict of interest . <p>
