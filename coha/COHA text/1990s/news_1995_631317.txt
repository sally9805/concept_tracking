<p> Imagine a sprawling city near the south end of Lake Michigan with marvelous museums , great shopping , terrific ethnic food , a world-class zoo , sports of all sorts , an excellent symphony orchestra and a daily rush hour that slows you down all of 10 minutes . <p> Sounds like Chicago until you get to the rush hour . <p> For urban delights without the urban crush , drive 85 miles north on Interstate 94 to Milwaukee , 18th largest city in the nation with 600,000 residents within the city limits and 1.4 million in the metropolitan area . Once the nation 's largest producer of beer , it still is known as a brewing capital , and is famous for its gemutlichkeit ( friendly hospitality ) . <p> Milwaukee 's character owes much to the " forty-eighters , " intellectuals who fled Germany after the 1848 revolutions there failed to put an end to monarchy . These intellectuals brought with them their passion for education and all things cultural . <p> Theaters , Freethinker groups , athletic clubs and musical groups flourished .

This building houses a bit of everything from the 15th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique collection of Haitian art and , of course , some nifty German beer steins . <p> Next door in the rebuilt Chicago &; North Western railway depot is the delightful Betty Brinn Children 's Museum , with exhibits aimed at children 1 to 10 . Almost 100,000 people have visited since it opened April 4 . All the exhibits are designed so that children of varying ages can find something appropriate to their understanding . There 's a view of Lake Michigan out the back windows , and next to it a toddler play area with a nautical theme . <p> " We do n't have a gift shop . That was a conscious decision . We thought parents would appreciate it , " spokeswoman Janet Hartzel said . But kids still can take home a souvenir  --  there 's a craft area where they can make their own . <p> A block away in the posh Cudahy Tower apartment building is the Boulevard Inn , with lake and museum views , and a 50-year history of good food .

If you love china , walk out its back door on Mason Street to the George Watts china store , a landmark and home of a popular tearoom . <p> Nearby is the dark-wood-paneled Karl Ratzsch 's , established 1904 , one of the Big Three of old-line German restaurants in Milwaukee . The others are John Ernst 's Restaurant , a youngster opened on Ogden Avenue in 1938 , and in the most German-looking building of them all , Mader 's German Restaurant on Old World Third Street . Across from Mader 's is the meat market , still in business , where Usinger 's sausages first were made . Next door to Mader 's is the Spice House , which the Denver Post called " the best spice store in America . " It 's a must stop for serious cooks . <p> This food-oriented block is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east bank , immediately to the south , are the Milwaukee Repertory Theater , the historic landmark Pabst Theater , and the modern Performing Arts Center , where you 'll find plays , ballet , opera and the permanent home of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra , itself worth an 85-mile drive . <p> The city has completed three-quarters of a riverwalk stretching from Marshall Field 's on the south side of Wisconsin Avenue north to Old World Third Street . It 's mostly on the west side of the river , with two pedestrian bridges linking it to buildings on the east bank . <p> Downtown Shopping <p> The riverwalk is the eastern terminus of the Grand Avenue Mall , a successful attempt to bring shoppers downtown from the suburbs . It stretches four blocks along the south side of Wisconsin Avenue , anchored at one end by Field 's ( in the old Gimbel 's building ) and at the other by the Boston Store . One of the middle blocks was torn down and rebuilt for the mall , and the other just needed a facelift  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first turned-inward shopping blocks . <p> One reason for Grand Avenue Mall 's success is there is plenty of parking in lots and ramps connected to it or just across the street . And it 's just off the downtown extension of Interstate 94 . <p> Several large hotels are clustered within two or three blocks of the mall , as are the convention center , the Milwaukee Auditorium and the Milwaukee Arena . <p> South of Wisconsin Avenue and east of the Milwaukee River is the old warehouse district , rapidly turning into posh shops , upscale housing and a major antiques area . <p> Continue west on Wisconsin past the Milwaukee Public Library ( with the totem pole out front ) and turn north one block on 8th Street to the Milwaukee Public Museum . See the new exhibit on Native Americans in Wisconsin  --  put together after consultation with the various tribes  --  and take a look at all the lifelike settings for all the display . <p> That sort of setting is known as the Milwaukee Style . It was the brainchild of Carl E. Akeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unrealistic look of animal skins that were just sewn together , stuffed and held rigid with leg rods , then displayed alone in glass cases . <p> He stretched skins over lifelike molds , then set them in re-creations of nature . His first total habitat group displayed a muskrat colony , with a cross-section of a muskrat lodge placed against the glass to show its interior . Akeley later did famous work at the Field Museum in Chicago . <p> Life as Milwaukee beer barons lived it can be seen at the Pabst Mansion on Wisconsin Avenue . With the original furniture having been stored in the attic , it now has been restored to its full glory of dark , heavily carved wood , vast chandeliers and embroidered window shades . The ladies ' parlor is exactly as Mrs. Pabst had it a century ago . <p> Do n't miss the handmade dollhouse upstairs , which took Caroline Radoszewski 15 years to build .

It also has a hall of fame and allows public skating twice a day September through mid-April . Call ( 414 ) 266-0100 . <p> Whether you go there or not  --  and you should  --  you ca n't miss the botanic gardens at the Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory . It 's that bunch of giant geodesic domes that loom on the Milwaukee skyline . Inside you can visit a rain forest and a desert , see changing displays of flowers , and if you 're sharp-eyed , spot the green monsters . <p> The monsters are scary-looking plastic creatures that move around as if by magic from one lurking spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adults . Blame them on the Milwaukee Public Museum , where staffers liked to insert tiny out-of-time items in displays to see who would spot them . Then Lisa Liljegren moved from the museum to the botanic gardens and mentioned this in joke . <p> Within days , there were moveable monsters in the gardens . <p> Specifically <p> Greyhound has 14 buses a day from Chicago to Milwaukee , with an adult round-trip fare of $ 22 .

Now , he says he 'll be working indefinitely . " With the economy the way it is now and people losing money in their 401(k) 's , that is another reason to keep working , " says Durham , who has a job at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . In fact , a whopping 70 percent of Americans ages 45 to 74 plan to postpone retirement -- both because they enjoy working and they need the income , according to a recent AARP survey . But jobs are n't easy to come by right now , especially for workers who are middle aged or older . In February alone , U.S. employers shed 651,000 jobs , and almost a third of employed adults age 45 and older think it 's likely that their job will be eliminated this year , according to a separate AARP survey . It will be challenging -- but not impossible -- for middle-aged and older workers to find a new job . " Just because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's hiring , " says Steven Greenberg , founder and chief executive of Jobs4Point0.com , a job-search website for those age 40 and older .

" Industries that were great a year and a half or two years ago are now struggling , " says Bob Skladany , vice president of research for RetirementJobs.com .

" U.S. News recently consulted RetirementJobs.com to determine the best cities for retirement-age job seekers . The analysis took into account employment growth , the unemployment rate , housing costs , the cost of living , and proximity to high-quality healthcare .

Cities with well-diversified economies are thriving despite the recession . More than 140 companies are headquartered in Bellevue , Wash. , including well-known names like Expedia , T-Mobile , and drugstore.com . The area , which includes nearby cities Seattle and Everett , added 6,200 jobs in the past year , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . If you move here for a job , the 1,894 acres of parks and abundant access to freshwater lakes and Puget Sound will keep you here . Oklahoma City earned bragging rights in December 2008 when it surpassed Washington , D.C. , to become the city with the lowest jobless rate in the country . And the cost of living is far lower in Oklahoma than in D.C. , making it a better spot for retirees looking to cut expenses . Although it was founded as an oil town , Oklahoma City today boasts an economy that also includes information technology and healthcare services . Many of the best places to find enjoyable work are college towns like Lubbock , Texas , and Charlottesville , Va. , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs . At Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y. , 43 percent of employees are age 50 or older .

Penn State University in State College , Pa. , even has a retirement community on campus . Residents can take free courses , pick up priority football and basketball tickets , and visit an on-site ice creamery . The healthcare industry has proved itself resilient in this economic environment . Almost half of the 30 fastest-growing occupations named by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are within health services , such as home health aides and pharmacy technicians .

" I have to go through a rigorous exam every year to make sure all my mental facilities are intact , but as long as I am capable , I will keep on working . " Public-sector jobs can provide a sense of security during turbulent times . Although they tend to pay on the low side , government jobs typically offer generous health and pension benefits , which many private companies have been slashing . Darlene Hieb , 76 , who officially retired in 2006 , now works two days a week as an office assistant for the city government of Bismarck , N.D.

Plum jobs at the North Dakota State Capitol Building Tower , constructed during the Great Depression , come with a view of a 132-acre park .
