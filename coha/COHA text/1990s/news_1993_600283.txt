<p> A national logjam over what to do with low-level radioactive waste is splitting communities , straining hospitals and utilities and forcing policymakers to reconsider their disposal plan . <p> " The whole thing 's a mess . It needs to go back to Congress , " says Nebraska farmer Craig Zeisler , who lives near a proposed disposal site . <p> Millions of pounds of radioactive wastes are accumulating across the nation , making the question of what to do with it more important than ever . <p> At the same time , the only two current disposal sites - in Richland , Wash. , and Barnwell , S.C . - are nearing capacity and will have to shut down . Wastes that are n't going to those permanent sites are piling up in makeshift storage facilities across the USA . <p> Fallout nationwide : <p> Medical researchers say they 'll halt important work on cancer-fighting and other drugs unless the crisis is resolved - soon . <p> " I am not going to allow anybody to generate large quantities of radioactive waste unless I know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of radiation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles . <p> Some drugs cost more . Because manufacturers pay more to dispose of radioactive isotopes used in testing , they 're charging 20% more this year for research drugs and 5% more for clinical drugs . <p> Some consumers are paying more for nuclear power because disposal costs are up and new waste sites are n't ready . <p> States are squabbling among themselves over who should dump and where . In Michigan , more than 50,000 cubic feet of radioactive waste is piled up at 53 temporary storage sites . <p> The waste disposal plan approved by Congress in 1980 is threatening to come unraveled . The idea was for states to take responsibility for low-level nuclear waste disposal , the federal government for more dangerous high-level waste . <p> States had a choice : build a site alone or form a compact with other states to share a common repository . Forty-two states formed nine compacts ; five states plan to build their own . Five others - including Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although initial work proceeded smoothly , states encountered massive opposition when each compact zeroed in on a possible location for its disposal site . <p> In New York , protesters used tractors to form blockades so engineers could n't conduct site assessments . Final studies on five candidate sites are expected by 1994 . <p> In Texas , the city of El Paso sued to relocate a proposed site in remote Hudspeth County . Construction on the 16,000-acre site is expected to begin in 1995 . <p> In California , authorities identified a site in federally owned Ward Valley , 25 miles from Needles . But the state is awaiting title transfer from the federal government . <p> In Nebraska , the state sued to keep a dump site out of Boyd County after residents voted it down on grounds of health and safety . They feared the 320-acre site would pollute a wetlands area where it was targeted to go . <p> " We have families that are broken up over this . And people here are getting to be not only anti-politician but anti-scientific , " says Loren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The consequence of these and other protests : States have missed key deadlines , including last Jan. 1 , when Washington and South Carolina were allowed to begin refusing wastes at their two permanent sites . They still accept wastes from most states , but charge more for disposal . <p> And , barring a miracle , states are going to miss the next key deadline : Jan. 1 , 1994 , when new waste sites are supposed to be open for business . <p> " Every state missed its milestone , " says Michael Mariotte of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service . <p> Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary , whose department provides technical assistance , says the federal government should n't force compliance . <p> " States do not well receive , ' I 'm the federal government come here to help out , ' " she says . " I 'm not going to try to divine for them the solution , but rather work with them in a partnership . " <p> Every state produces some of the more than 1 million cubic feet of low-level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-ray debris or pieces of nuclear power plants . <p> The nation 's 100 nuclear power plants generate the most - about 56% of the waste - followed by industry at 31% . The rest is about evenly split between government installations and research centers - hospitals , universities and labs . <p> Although Congress has yet to agree on an overhaul , pressure continues to mount . <p> " People want a solution , " says Ann Bisconti of the U.S. Council on Energy Awareness , a nuclear industry group . <p> " The American public has a sense of generational responsibility , that disposing of our waste instead of leaving it for future generations is the environmentally responsible thing to do . " <p> How states are dealing with disposal of waste When Congress crafted a nuclear waste plan in 1980 , it encouraged states to share new disposal sites . California , Illinois , New York , Nebraska and Texas decided to build low-level radioactive waste disposal sites . Others joined together in waste " compacts .

About 3,000 tons of high-level waste are produced a year - mostly used fuel rods from nuclear power plants . The rods are metal cylinders filled with uranium pellets . High-level waste has the highest potential risk to human health and the environment . These wastes can remain dangerous for thousands of years . <p> Low-level : These wastes are usually materials that come in contact with radioactive substances . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These wastes - gloves , filters , tools - come from nuclear power plants , hospitals and research centers . <p> How nuclear plant waste is stored <p> The 3,000 tons of nuclear fuel waste generated each year by U.S. nuclear power plants is stored in two ways . The most common method is to keep the material encased in water pools . The second method is to store the waste in dry casks . How nuclear waste is prepared for storage : <p> FUEL PELLETS Uranium oxide pellets power nuclear reactors until their energy has been released . These small , highly radioactive pellets are a dense ceramic-like material . <p> FUEL RODS Pellets stacked end to end are sealed inside zirconium alloy rods . Length of rod : 14 feet Diameter : 1/2 inch <p> FUEL ASSEMBLIES Fuel rods are bundled into 6- or 9-inch square assemblies , ready for storage . Each assembly holds 63 to 264 fuel rods <p> Water pool storage method Fuel assemblies are stored in cooled pools . Boron is added to slow down neutrons escaping from assemblies . In a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to about half of what they were in the reactor , and the levels continue to decline . Walls of pool are made of reinforced concrete 6 feet thick , lined with stainless steel Depth in all the pools is constant at 40 feet - with 25 feet of water covering the fuel assemblies <p> Dry cask storage method In an underwater procedure , protecting operators from radiation , 21-33 fuel assemblies are loaded into steel casks . Once loaded , the casks are removed from the water , drained , filled with helium and sealed with 48 1 1/2-inch bolts . <p> STORAGE PADS Casks are transported by rail , truck or barge to outdoor storage sites where they are placed on 3-foot reinforced concrete pads . Each concrete pad can holds up to 28 upright casks At some facilities , the casks are place horizontally in 30-foot tall concrete and steel bunkers . <p> LOADED WEIGHT A filled cask weights 120 tons - as much as two M1A1 battle tanks . <p> DURABILITY OF CASKS Casks are tested to withstand ... 300 mph tornado winds Lightning strikes 1,850 degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash by 140-ton locomotive <p> How much spent nuclear fuel there is About 22,000 tons of spent fuel is stored in the USA . This would cover an area the size of a football field about 9 feet deep . <p> How long nuclear waste must be stored Spent fuel must be stored at least 10,000 years . High-level nuclear waste is mixture of a variety of nuclear components with half-lives ranging from 24 seconds to nearly 15.9 million years . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : May 17 , 1993 <p> CORRECTION : A story Tuesday should have said North Carolina will choose a nuclear waste dump site by year 's end . Sites under consideration are in Richmond County and on the Wake County-Chatham County line .
