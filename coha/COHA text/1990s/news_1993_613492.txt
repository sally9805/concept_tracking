<p> Ocoee , Tenn. - From 1849 to 1853 , Cherokee laborers with picks , drills and black powder carved out a road for wagons to haul copper ore down the Ocoee River gorge to the railhead in nearby Cleveland . <p> It 's taking plenty of hauling , too , to bring the Olympic whitewater slalom events to the upper Ocoee , where the last surviving segment of the copper road still twists along the bank . <p> Congress , two federal bureaucracies , the state of Tennessee , commercial outfitters , the canoe and kayak community and , of course , the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games ( ACOG ) all have their oars in a water sport that could end up costing $ 30 million by the time the medals are handed out . <p> " A political science grad student would love to do a thesis on how you do this , it covers so many entities , " said Ed Cole , assistant commissioner for Tennessee 's department of environment and conservation . <p> No pristine wilderness <p> Two hours north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafting in the country . Tennessee 's Olympic dream is to create the most beautiful venue of the 1996 Games as well as a long-term facility that will channel millions of tourist dollars a year into one of the poorest areas in the southern Appalachians . <p> But pristine wilderness , it 's not . <p> The upper Ocoee riverbed , now a tumble of orange rocks and boulders , is the domain of the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) , which takes the water from three dams to generate electric power and expects to be compensated for any it puts back into the river . <p> Rising on either side is the lush Cherokee National Forest , reclaimed from a clear-cut wasteland by the U.S. Forest Service , which has charge of constructing , managing and , ultimately , licensing use of the Olympic site . <p> Tennessee a happy host <p> Upstream is the Copper Basin , the biggest environmental disaster in the nation 's history , where acid rain from 19th century copper smelting created a 30,000-acre moonscape that deposited tons of toxic heavy metals into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists down the lower Ocoee in rubber rafts and do n't want to get soaked for the cost of an Olympic venue . <p> And all around is the state of Tennessee , which is delighted to host the sole Olympic competition that will take place entirely outside of Georgia but is not yet clear how it 's going to pay for it . <p> The four whitewater events - men 's kayak , women 's kayak , men 's single and double canoe - are optional Olympic sports that have been on the program only in Munich in 1972 and Barcelona last year . In each case , the water ran through a concrete channel constructed for the occasion in an urban landscape . <p> Y'all build it <p> What made the Ocoee gleam in the eyes of whitewater enthusiasts was the prospect of showing off their sport amidst the natural beauty of a real river . Nor would the benefits be solely aesthetic . <p> " Artificial rivers pulsate in unpredictable ways , " said Bill Endicott , coach of the U.S. Olympic whitewater slalom team in Barcelona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's less luck and chance involved . " <p> Over some resistance from the International Olympic Committee , ACOG put the Ocoee site into its final bid for the Games , but its words to the whitewater community were : Only if y'all build it will we come . <p> ACOG plans to pay nothing to put on the whitewater events other than the estimated $ 2 million cost of televising them . And the committee expects to recoup that money by scooping up the gate receipts from spectators who will crowd the 15,000-seat temporary grandstands along the river . <p> Sides too steep <p> For the past 15 years , commercial rafters and private kayakers and canoers have flocked to the lower Ocoee ( between dams 1 and 2 ) , and the original idea was to hold the Olympic events there . But it soon became apparent that the sides of the lower Ocoee gorge were too steep to construct the grandstands , broadcasting center and other facilities demanded by ACOG . Enough flat riverbank could be found only upriver , between dams 2 and 3 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision was made to narrow the river with landfill to create the 1,000-yard course , a difficult engineering feat . <p> On a riverbank beside the lower Ocoee , the TVA is constructing a $ 250,000 , 100-yard , gravel-and-concrete scale model of the course-to-be . This will enable designers to experiment with constricting and arranging the channel before landfill is poured and cranes start moving boulders around . <p> To approximate reality , TVA engineers used a device called a laser vaccillometer to chart roughly 20,000 separate points on the riverbed . These points have been captured in 300 cross sections delineated with two miles of wire shelving . <p> " I have never had a model with this level of detail , " said Paul Loiseau , whose job it is to build models of TVA river sites . <p> A peek at ' 96 <p> Working overtime , Mr. Loiseau and his crew hope to have water rushing through the model by Aug. 30 , when this year 's World Cup - international whitewatering 's annual five-site competition - concludes with a meet on the lower Ocoee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first glimpse of what 1996 holds in store . <p> A preliminary cost estimate of $ 24 million ( excluding broadcasting ) has the federal government kicking in $ 12 million , with the balance divided equally between Tennessee and private contributions . <p> Tennessee , which estimates a permanent boon to the region 's economy of about $ 15 million a year , originally intended to sell bonds that would be paid off by a tax on commercial rafting . But the rafters , who already pay TVA $ 2 a head for use of water on the lower Ocoee and a 10 percent gross-revenue tax to county government , screamed bloody murder . <p> If a state funding mechanism has yet to be devised , most of the federal contribution still lies in the toils of the congressional budget process . Last month , for example , the House of Representatives cut in half the $ 6 million funding request for fiscal 1994 . <p> No commercialism <p> As for private contributions , Forest Service Olympic project director Paul Wright claims preliminary commitments of $ 2 million , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge to such fund-raising is ACOG 's determination to prevent a company from grabbing the Olympic rings on the cheap . <p> " The bottom line is , you ca n't use your involvement in a commercial way , " said Charlie Battle , ACOG 's executive vice president . " It 's not a problem if they put a sign up after the Games saying this was donated by so-and-so . " <p> Despite the funding uncertainties , the Forest Service is plunging ahead . It expects to name a contractor and to issue a preliminary environmental impact statement in about a month . Construction of the course , which needs to be completed for Olympic trials in mid-1995 , is likely to begin early next year . <p> And if the funds are lacking to put up all of ACOG 's amenities , the Forest Service can live with that . <p> " We do n't look to maintain it as an urban whitewater park , " Mr. Wright said
