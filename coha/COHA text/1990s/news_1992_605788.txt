<p> " We 've had a sleeping dragon , and now the dragon is waking up . " James Doherty , head of the Group Health Association of America , was talking about the growing cry for health care reform . <p> Confronted by costs increasing more than three times as fast as inflation and by growing numbers of Americans without coverage , people of almost every political stripe are calling for changes in the health care system . <p> The alarm went off on Nov. 5 when the voters of Pennsylvania elected Democrat Harris Wofford to the Senate after a campaign in which his main issues were jobs and health care for all . Democrats and Republicans , including the Republicans in the White House , got the message , and health care as an issue moved to a front burner . <p> In the words of Office of Management and Budget Director Richard G. Darman , the present system , with its ever greater costs to treat ever fewer people , is " not financially sustainable . " <p> The system is " broken , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Band-Aids will no longer do . . . I think we have to sink further into the crisis , maybe even toward chaos , before people begin to scream but when mad enough , they will demand the changes that need to be made . " <p> While there is agreement that the system is " broken , " there is little consensus on how to fix it . The battle lines are being drawn around two radically different approaches : incremental changes that build on the current system of private and public health care to gradually extend coverage to more of the uninsured ; or comprehensive change that guarantees coverage to every American either through a combination private-public program or a government health plan . <p> Deciding which way to go  --  and how soon  --  is the challenge facing President Bush and the Congress as it convenes today . <p> Small Steps and Sacrifice <p> The Bush administration opposes radical overhaul of health care . Bush has promised what he called a " comprehensive " health care proposal in his State of the Union message next week . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below a certain income buy insurance , reforms of private health insurance to help small employers buy coverage for their employees , increased payments by Medicare recipients above a certain income , a plan to tax part of employees ' health benefits . <p> More than 20 health care bills have been introduced , but members of Congress almost unanimously see no chance that a comprehensive health plan can be passed this session , despite the newly fevered rhetoric . The 1992 session will be short , with adjournments for summer conventions and fall campaigning , and the strained budgets of federal and state governments and a faltering economy leave little room for new initiatives . <p> " We need major overhaul of the health system , " Sen. Lloyd Bentsen ( D-Tex. ) said recently . " But it 's going to take time . " <p> As Ohio Republican Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr. , explained : " We 're moving toward it slowly . There is a general consensus that the present system is not satisfactory . " <p> There is one subject , however , that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the fact that everyone will have to make sacrifices to achieve any comprehensive program . <p> For one thing , most authorities agree , there would have to be some new taxes or hidden taxes . Requiring employers , especially small employers , to cover all their workers would in effect be a new tax on business in recessionary times . Taking away part of the tax deduction for health benefits would be a cut in workers ' take-home pay . <p> And fundamentally , most authorities believe , an inevitable price of giving everyone a basic level of care would be some rationing of care . Whether it is called " allocation of resources " or " managed " or " coordinated " care , it nonetheless means denying people some treatments they would like to have . <p> Politicians are acutely aware of polls showing that while most Americans think the health system needs change , most are satisfied with their own care  --  and in survey after survey only about one respondent in five is willing to pay more than $ 200 a year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough for a major program , most health analysts say . <p> Add any mention of a need for " rationing " care and support in surveys plummets , even though de facto rationing has long been part of the health system . It is in fact growing as emergency rooms and trauma centers close , public clinics cut hours and employers shrink coverage . <p> " If people think national health insurance requires them to make major sacrifices , they say no , " said Robert Blendon , head of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health and student of health polls . Rationing , he said , is " the Willie Horton of national health care . " <p> Driving the Crisis <p> Almost everyone agrees on the elements that drive the crisis . <p> Cost . Americans ' health care is expected to cost $ 817 billion this year , up at least 11 percent from last year , consuming a record 14 percent of the gross national product , about one dollar in every seven spent by Americans . If the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become one dollar in four in the early 21st century . <p> The uninsured . Currently 35.7 million Americans are uninsured and about the same number have inadequate insurance . Both figures are increasing . Medicare covers only 40 percent of elders ' health costs . Medicaid covers just 42 percent of the poor . One American in four lost health insurance for some period in the past two years . <p> Economic drain . Employees ' health benefits cost U.S. automakers more than steel , one of many cases where health expenses drive up the price of American products . Health benefits have been a prime cause of eight out of 10 recent strikes , from the Chicago Symphony to Nynex , the New York-New England phone company . <p> Experts estimate that 15 to 25 percent of hospital charges and health insurance premiums go to replace the money insurers and hospitals lose when some patients pay nothing or government agencies pay too little . <p> Erosion of care . In increasing numbers , patients are turned away or discouraged by doctors ' signs saying , " Pay now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jammed waiting rooms of under-financed public hospitals and clinics . The uninsured get a fourth less care than the insured . <p> Ron Anderson , physician-president of Dallas 's public Parkland Hospital , said : " If the middle-class , wealthy and poor suddenly were placed in the same boat regarding access to medical services , the availability of health care for the poor would immediately improve . The middle-class and wealthy would demand it . " <p> Options in the Debate <p> Until recently , the Bush administration has dragged its feet on the issue . In his January 1990 State of the Union address , the president ordered a study of ways to cover more people while controlling costs . An advisory panel headed by Washington attorney Deborah Steelman was given the job . It reported only last December and then did not recommend a comprehensive plan but rather several steps " to lay the foundation " for " more complete reform by the end of the decade . " <p> Wofford 's Pennsylvania upset altered the pace . In a now oft-quoted ad , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think working Americans should have a right to a doctor . " <p> Bush on Dec. 6 then promised a proposal in next week 's address , saying , " I do think the time has come for the administration to come forward with a comprehensive program . " He said it would " not call for increasing taxes . " <p> But Gradison  --  respected on both sides of the aisle for health expertise  --  said that , whatever savings might result from administrative reforms , " to fill in the extensive gaps . . . we would still need to raise substantial new sums . " <p> Democratic proposals range from national health insurance  --  the government collects taxes to pay everyone 's bills  --  to mandates making employers cover virtually all employees or else pay into a fund to cover everyone , to proposals to help small employers buy coverage . <p> Most Republicans want some kind of incremental reform , change a step at a time . Several favor tax credits and other tax changes or other measures to help , or prod , individuals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main ways to reform health care . <p> Pay or play . The private insurance system is preserved , but employers must either provide basic coverage or pay into a fund to help the government do so . Then public programs would be enlarged or combined to cover those otherwise uninsured . This would add some $ 30 billion in federal spending , Democratic sponsors say ; $ 64 billion , the administration says . <p> Tax credits and vouchers . Everyone gets either a full or partial tax credit  --  or , for the poor , a tax-supported voucher  --  to buy health coverage . Estimated cost by Republican sponsors : $ 150 billion over five years . <p> A managed market . Both employers and public payers  --  governments or new regional entities created for this purpose  --  would bargain with competing managed care plans  --  HMOs and related groups or networks of doctors and hospitals  --  to provide affordable care to all . Everyone , or as many people as possible , would be moved  --  or induced to move by financial rewards or penalties  --  into such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control costs by limiting the choice of doctors and hospitals and restraining the use of costly specialists , tests , treatments and hospitalization . In addition , new regulations would require that all plans and insurers offer a basic benefit package to all comers without cancellations , regardless of prior medical problems . <p> To achieve universal coverage , low-income or unemployed people would have to get subsidies from public funds to buy health coverage , again adding $ 30 to $ 64 billion to public costs , by differing estimates . <p> Universal health care . As practiced in Canada and several other industrialized countries , all residents are entitled to care that is mainly funded by the government from taxes . People can choose their doctors , who are totally or largely paid by the government . Costs are controlled by limiting the total pot out of which doctors , hospitals and other care givers are paid . Private insurance survives only to pay for services the universal plan omits or some patients prefer . <p> Controlling Costs <p> The government would then be paying something close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by Congress 's General Accounting Office , maintain that the United States now spends so many billions  --  some say nearly one health dollar in four  --  just running the present patchwork-quilt system that switching to a plan like Canada 's would soon save enough money to cover everyone without requiring new funding . <p> Many scholars disagree , and a Republican study says the cost would be an added $ 81 billion a year . In fact , no one truly knows how many Americans not now getting care would seek care if they carried a card entitling them to enter a doctor 's office or a hospital . <p> Whatever plan is adopted , the growing ranks of the aged , urban violence and AIDS will demand more spending on medical care . To control the escalating costs , say most scholars , Americans will have to accept more restrictions on care : limits on use of new technologies , even delays for some treatments . <p> As Henry Aaron , director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution , and William Schwartz , professor of medicine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rationing Medical Care , " any reforms that promise pain-free cost control  --  whether by ending wasteful administration or wasteful care or by competition among care givers  --  will be swamped by ever new and costly medical technologies , and sooner or later " a significant reduction in the growth of medical spending will require the sacrifice of beneficial services . " <p> Staff members on congressional committees like to say , " The devil is in the details . " In trying to reform health care by any plan , cost control is the devil . Most health economists believe that unless the government puts a firm lid on total annual health spending , any measure to get care to all Americans would increase the federal budget by at least $ 50 billion . Methods of trying to control costs range from managing care to limiting fees to setting spending targets or limits . <p> Yet Gail Wilensky , head of the Health Care Financing Administration , the Medicare-Medicaid agency , does not think setting a hard spending limit would work in this country . " We 're just not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're not going to lower health costs . We can only lower the rate of growth . " <p> Rhetoric vs . Action <p> While comprehensive reform is not expected this year , there is movement in Congress toward addressing the problems small businesses encounter in covering their employees . Ohio 's Rep. Gradison saw " an excellent chance of agreement on reform of the small group health insurance market "  --  by regulating insurers to assure small employers they wo n't lose coverage or face impossible annual increases because of a few expensively ill workers . <p> Congress is skittish about any bill , however , given the beating members took two years ago when they passed , then were forced by a rebellion of senior citizens , to repeal a catastrophic health insurance bill that charged them a share of the cost . " We thought we were doing what the seniors wanted , but it did n't turn out that way , " said Sen. John D. " Jay " Rockefeller ( D-W.Va . ) . <p> House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is compelling , but the appetite for public action is n't there yet . Attempting to legislate now would be a terrible mistake . " <p> There is still another roadblock to action : the political and economic clout of the huge health complex : doctors , hospitals , insurers , drug and equipment makers , imaging and a myriad of other commercial clinics . They add up to a highly profitable industry , with 8.5 million workers , more than 200 political action committees and a deep aversion to any change that threatens the status quo . <p> For the near future , the debate will be framed by whatever Bush announces next week . <p> To Brookings 's Aaron and to James Todd , executive vice president of the American Medical Association , the president has to commit himself to a plan to control costs and assure everyone care . Todd would like to see the plan " within a few months . " Both also want to see some initiatives in his address next week . <p> Karen Davis , Johns Hopkins head of health policy and management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . They believe the time is overdue for the president to propose , in Reinhardt 's words , " a system with no gaps , one that covers everyone no matter how you twist and turn . " <p> Davis advocates universal health insurance financed by both government and private programs . Reinhardt would back either tax credits so everyone can buy insurance or a public program to cover the uninsured . It would take at least $ 50 billion to do the job , he emphasized : " If the president proposes something that costs only $ 10 billion , I 'd say he 's not serious . " <p> For the present , the most likely scenario is talk , and overshadowing the debate is the economy 's health . As the recession continues , and as medical care consumes a greater share of the country 's resources , the pressure for reform is likely to build . <p> " I think we will just stumble into a health policy , " Reinhardt predicted . " Things are moving in the right direction . Ultimately , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment : Here is how much you can spend . " <p> In other words , the dragon is awake and the debate has begun .
