<p> It was approaching noon on a sweltering July day in 1988 when an incident occurred that I can not seem to forget . I was in the midst of a 100-acre boggy patch of land within the much-larger Cicero Swamp Wildlife Management Area near Syracuse . I was beginning what is now a five-year project investigating the ecology of the eastern massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus catenatus ) , a small rattlesnake with a predilection for wetlands . <p> I had just captured a 21-inch long male and was carefully maneuvering it into a " squeezebox , " a device designed to restrain venomous reptiles for the safety of both the handler and the animal . Suddenly , the noon siren from the Cicero Fire Station began to sound . just as suddenly , and seemingly from all around me , several coyotes began to howl . I was unnerved at first , especially since they seemed quite close . I nearly let my attention drift from the task at hand . Then it occurred to me what a unique experience this was . Here I was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban center in New York , and I was in the presence of two of the top predators that still remain in a fragmented and human-dominated landscape . While coyotes are considered recent arrivals to the Northeast , massasaugas have existed in this region for thousands of years . Seeing and hearing these creatures in such proximity to a human 's world is a powerful reminder of nature 's ability to overwhelm . <p> The eastern massasauga is commonly referred to as the pygmy rattler , owing to its relatively small size . The name is more correctly applied to two closely-related species that occur in the southern United States and Mexico . The massasauga probably acquired this moniker because it averages a bit smaller than the timber rattlesnake , New York 's other rattler . Massasaugas rarely exceed 30 inches in total length although individuals three feet long have been encountered . In contrast , timber rattlesnakes can attain lengths of up to six feet . <p> Massasaugas are also known as swamp rattlers , after their habitat preferences . Across their range they are generally associated with low-lying wetland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies . Some researchers have detected a shift in habitat from lowlands to uplands as the season progresses . Residents around the Cicero area have related to me how , 20 to 30 years ago , they would commonly find rattlesnakes in hay fields during the late summer harvest . <p> Massasaugas are classified with a group of snakes called pit vipers because they possess two small and unique openings on their head . These sense organs enable them to detect objects warmer than their immediate surroundings . This is a useful ability for locating their primary prey , warm-blooded rodents . Mice , voles and shrews probably account for most of their diet , although it has been reported they will take frogs , and juvenile massasaugas will feed on other species of snakes . In spite of their formidable weaponry , massasaugas have many potential predators and they are especially vulnerable when they are very young . Ground-dwelling species including weasels , mink and coyotes as well as avian predators such as hawks , owls and turkeys have all been implicated as enemies . <p> Like all rattlesnakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to 19 baby rattlers , with nine being the average . In Cicero Swamp birth occurs during late summer and , somewhat paradoxically , mating occurs at this time also . It is believed that females typically breed once every two years , and this may explain the observed breeding cycle ; females mate in one season , store sperm over winter , and give birth the following season . This translates to a low biological replacement rate , especially given the high mortality associated with the snake 's first year of life . <p> The massasauga is generally distributed across the north central United States and parts of the Province of Ontario . In nearly all of these places , it is listed as Endangered , Threatened or a Species of Special Concern . Here in New York , it has the dubious distinction of being one of our rarest reptiles , and in 1983 , based primarily on status surveys initiated by DEC 's endangered species unit , it was added to the state 's Enclangered Species List . Under the law , the massasauga may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed ) , imported , transported or sold without a permit issued by DEC . <p> Currently , this snake is known conclusively from only two sites in the state , Cicero Swamp and another large wetland complex in western New York . Within the past 100 years , it was known from at least four or five other locations within the state . It is believed that at the two remaining sites , the species is undergoing a substantial decline , and that a combination of factors is probably responsible . As reported in these pages before ( November-December 1984 ) , this relatively recent trend of either population reduction or loss of entire poplulations is related to human activities that alter swampland to the extent that it is no longer large enough or otherwise suitable for massasaugas . When habitat loss is coupled with a history of overcollecting by irresponsible snake enthusiasts for the live animal trade , and unrestricted slaughter whenever these snakes were encountered , the results are disastrous . <p> This latter phenomenon is based entirely on a misunderstanding of this animal 's true nature rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , massasaugas carry the burden of irrational fear and loathing by large segments of the general public . Although venomous , thus demanding caution when encountered , massasaugas are nonaggressive toward humans and are extremely secretive by nature . Rattlesnake venom is primarily an offensive weapon designed to subdue prey while minimizing injury to the snake . In snake terms , venom is expensive to produce and will only be used defensively as a last resort . I know of only one reported account of a human death that may be attributed to a bite by a massasauga in New York . In this case , the individual did not receive any medical treatment , and the evidence for snakebite was circumstantial . <p> In the case of Cicero Swamp , and probably in other places as well , massasaugas also must face the problems created by shifting patterns of natural succession that serve to render previously highquality , early successional habitat less and less suitable for the requirements of growth , maintenance and reproduction . It is believed that massasaugas occur in places like Cicero Swamp because it is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes are ectothermic ( i.e. , they derive their body heat from sources outside of their bodies ) and must endure northern winters by seeking places where temperatures do not drop below the freezing point . In Cicero Swamp , they hibernate under a thick blanket of sphagnum moss formed into raised hummocks that overlie spaces created by a branching network of shrub roots . These spaces are often partly filled with water . <p> Over time , these bog-like areas are invaded by trees and may eventually acquire characteristics of uplands . in past times , these animals probably could adjust by simply moving someplace else , an option that is no longer available due , in large part , to agricultural practices that claimed surrounding wetlands . Additionally , other dynamic natural processes , such as fire , could operate to maintain open patches in a matrix of surrounding forested wetlands . <p> Cicero Swamp consists of about 7,000 acres of a variety of wetland types , about 4,500 acres of which are state lands . Most of the swamp is composed of northern hardwoods including red maple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conifers . Within this wooded swamp is a small patch of land that resembles a bog and is technically called a weakly minerotrophic fen . This area is often referred to as the " old burn " because of a fire that occurred here 100 years ago . This fire was reportedly very intense and burned deep into the underlying peat layer . <p> Today this area is dominated by a dense stand of shrubs , primarily mountain holly and highbush blueberry , which cover a mat of sphagnum moss . Studies conducted by Cheryl LeBlanc and Dr. Donald Leopold at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry found that the shrubs and trees that occur in this area are between 30 and 40 years old . it is probable that this area remained in a somewhat open condition for the first 60 years following the initial burn . Given the rapid growth rate of the woody plant species , it is likely that this area will succeed to a dense , tree-dominated landscape with a complete canopy cover . These conditions probably will not favor the continued existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require early stages of succession . Therefore , Alvin Breisch of DEC 's endangered species unit and I decided to test some experimental treatments to areas in Cicero Swamp that are designed to favor the massasauga , in short snake habitat management . It is expected that other species of plants and animals also will benefit from these treatments . <p> Prior to attempting manipulation of an animal habitat , it is prudent to learn as much as one can about its use of space and time . This information is best gained by repeated observations of individuals in their natural surroundings over the course of their active season . From experience , I know exactly how difficult it is to locate animals as cryptic and secretive as the massasauga . In most cases , once an animal is captured and marked for identification , it is unlikely that individual will be located again that season . Therefore , we decided to implant tiny radio transmitters into the body cavities of some individuals , a technique pioneered by Pennsylvania rattlesnake researcher , Dr. Howard Reinert . The implantation procedure was performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery clinic by the capable hands of Dr. Carolee Wallace , the zoo 's veterinarian . <p> Over a period of three years , 10 individuals were fitted with transmitters and tracked in the field for varying lengths of time . With a hand-held antennae and radio receiver , the signal produced by the transmitter can then be picked up . The strength and direction of the signal allowed my assistants and me to home in and locate the snakes , each of which is assigned an individual frequency . With this technology , I have been able to determine daily activity patterns of snakes , the size of their seasonal home ranges , and their habitat selection on a very fine scale . We learned that snakes do not prefer areas of extensive shrub growth with total canopy cover , but will use small , naturally-occuring openings . <p> Armed with this knowledge of habitat utilization we decided to test some methods of creating gaps in the thick shrub cover . With the help of student volunteers , DEC personnel and inmates from a nearby correctional facility , we undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrub canopy that totaled about two and a half acres . in each opening , the cut material was then burned . This was conducted in the late winter months when snakes were deep underground . Since then we have been monitoring plant regrowth patterns and small mammal abundance in the cleared areas , as well as use of these areas by massasaugas , especially those with radio transmitters . After one growing season , we have accumulated evidence that shows these cut and burned areas are being used by massasaugas . In the absence of naturally-occurring phenomena like fires , we believe it is possible to maintain these endangered animals within the confines of their historic range . <p> Another , equally important aspect of this study concerns the potential negative consequences of genetic isolation from other massasauga populations . I am beginning a study , in collaboration with researchers in Ontario , to survey the genetic structure of massasauga populations across their range . The level of relatedness between and among these populations needs to be understood before certain future management techniques , such as translocation of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wild places , there has been little to compare with the thrill of hearing the buzz of a rattlesnake 's tail , a fair and just warning to watch one 's step . The efforts described here represent the initial steps toward the recovery of this unique species . Massasauga rattlesnakes are truly a singular part of New York 's wild heritage and deserve a place in our grand conservation schemes . <p> Photo : A newborn massasauga up in a low shrub ( D.

His doctoral dissertation project concerns the ecology , management and ecological genetics of massasauga . <p> UNTITLED <p> People tend to place values , monetary or otherwise , on natural resources to gauge the contribution of those resources to the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing so difficult as placing a value on creatures like snakes that are so steeped in folklore and groundless myths . Indeed , the mass media and the entertainment industry continue to foster these negative images in an effort to capitalize on our fears ( witness the film Raiders of the Lost Ark ) . Unlike other animals that possess the ability to kill people , such as the tiger , rattlesnakes are rarely granted the human characteristic of nobility . <p> Three factors interact to make each massasauga population vulnerable to extinction . They possess a low biological replacement rate , they are subject to intense human persecution and exploitation and they suffer from loss and degradation of their wetland habitat . In the face of these threats and given their potential danger to human safety , why should we be concerned about them ? <p> One reason concerns the massasauga 's role in the wetland ecosystems as a top predator , especially of small mammals . These snakes exhibit a sitand-wait foraging strategy and complement the more active hunting of birds of prey and carnivorous mammals in regulating prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component of food webs and contribute to energy flow in biotic communities . Animals at or near the top of a food chain are useful as barometers of the health and well-being of a natural community or ecosystem . Scientific investigation of organisms like the massasauga can clearly lead to a greater understanding of ecological mysteries . Only with intact natural populations can the subtleties of these processes be illuminated . <p> In another scientific arena , the massasauga played an integral role in the development of antivenin , the antitoxin to snake venom . In 1887 , Henry Sewall used venom from the massasauga in a series of experiments that demonstrated how an animal could be immunized against snake venom . This led others to develop antitoxins for germ diseases such as tetanus and diphtheria . <p> Perhaps due to their tubular , limbless bodies with eyes that lack lids and therefore never close , snakes never fail to elicit an immediate reaction from people , either fear , fascination , or a mixture of both . The responses are doubly intense when the snake has a rattle on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are useful in creating the interest and the motivation to participate in larger environmental concerns by members of the general public . I have witnessed this phenomenon in action ; environmental educators should capitalize on this aspect of snakes , and wildlife in general , as a means of fostering positive conservation attitudes . <p> Finally , besides ecological or educational values , rattlesnakes possess a grace in form and function that can be appreciated from purely aesthetic points of view . <p>
