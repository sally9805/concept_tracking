<p> The day after he called for a new era of bipartisanship and cooperation in his second inaugural address , President Clinton put money where his mouth was . His new budget , he announced with flourish , would meet Republicans halfway on the thorny issue of how much to restrain the growth of Medicare . <p> After he was done , Clinton headed to a nearby hotel and preached a notably different sermon to the Democratic National Committee . In a sharp-edged , partisan speech , the president derided the Republicans as the party that " quadrupled our national debt " and exploited race and religion to divide Americans . <p> Bipartisanship , it seems , is easier promised than practiced . <p> In the context of red-meat rhetoric typically thrown out at party gatherings , nothing about Clinton 's DNC speech was out of the ordinary . Bashing the other side is a time-honored sport at such avowedly partisan meetings . Yet the timing and tone of his broadsides rankled Republican leaders who considered it at odds with his message of reconciliation , and that single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's very , very hard , " said George Edwards , director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A &M; University . " We do n't have a great history of bipartisanship , not just in the Clinton administration but in general , and in recent terms it 's been much worse . " <p> As Edwards sees it , the DNC address " just reflects the basic lack of discipline of Bill Clinton . His rhetoric has never been that disciplined , and he likes to play the crowd . " <p> For both the president and Congress , the next few months will be a learning process . Everyone seems to be committed to more harmony in the abstract , but no one can provide a concrete definition of how that will work . <p> Does bipartisanship mean that neither side can ever say anything negative about the other ? Or does it mean that legitimate policy debate is acceptable as long as personal attacks are avoided ? Is partisanship to be allowed in political settings and eschewed in legislative venues ? At what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstructive gridlock ? And who determines what is out of bounds , anyway ? <p> " There are no set rules , " said Charles Black , a longtime Republican strategist . " I consider it fair game for the president or the Republican congressional leadership to stake out their own positions and criticize the other side as long as they 're willing to sit down and negotiate and compromise . " <p> Indeed , Sen. Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) offered a vigorous defense of partisanship as a necessary ingredient in the great debate of important ideas . " Do I think it 's getting a bad rap ? " he said of partisanship . " Absolutely . In America , the only time when we stopped arguing , it was the Civil War . " <p> The process of governing is all about disagreement , healthy disagreement , he said , and seen against the backdrop of history , the current atmosphere that has so many hands wringing can hardly be considered as poisonous as it has been in the past . <p> " Democracy gives us permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Now , does sometimes it become petty and uncivil ? Yes . . . . But do we cane each other anymore ? No . Do we call each other out for duels anymore ? No . " <p> To the extent that there are any models , the last two years , in some eyes , provide some lessons . Republicans largely have concluded that the all-out budget showdown that led to two partial shutdowns of the federal government was a mistake . But the final weeks of last year 's legislative session are almost universally remembered as a breakthrough period where quarrels were set aside and consensus was reached on major health care , welfare and minimum wage legislation . <p> At the time , of course , each side was entering the fall election season yearning for victories to haul out on the campaign trail . Ultimately , Clinton and Republican leaders both saw vindication in the election results that returned them to power , providing incentives to continue in the same fashion . <p> Nevertheless , both sides represent different constituencies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second term offered some intriguing harbingers for the coming months . <p> Although Clinton 's Medicare proposal was initially greeted warmly by Republicans who appreciated his political concession , that was no guarantee of a free ride . By the time some of the inaugural glow had passed later in the week , it quickly came under fire from congressional Republicans who found fault with the merits of the actual plan . <p> On the other hand , the Senate unanimously confirmed Clinton 's choices for secretary of state and defense and set the stage for rapid confirmation of other new Cabinet members . <p> Clinton likewise looked for other ways to reach out . He met with members of Congress from both parties to plot strategy for legislation imposing tougher campaign contribution rules . He brought former president George Bush and retired Gen. Colin L. Powell to the White House Friday to announce an initiative aimed at increasing volunteerism . And he invited a bipartisan selection of senators and representatives to the mansion this weekend to watch the Super Bowl . <p> Yet Clinton 's speech at the DNC continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end . <p> The president declared , as he has several times in recent days , that his party won the argument over the role of government , but he put it in more stark terms than he did in his inaugural address . Instead of simply claiming victory , he chastised Republicans as fiscally irresponsible and racially divisive . <p> " Beginning nearly 30 years ago , they began to subtly use and then sometimes not so subtly use rhetoric to divide our people one from another  --  first on race and then later there were divisions based on religion and politics , which made it much more difficult for us to come together , " Clinton said . <p> The Republicans were also responsible for " trickle-down " economics , as Clinton called it . " The argument was that there really was a Santa Claus , that the deficits do n't matter and that they 'll go away anyway with supply-side economics if we just cut taxes , particularly for people in upper incomes , " he said . <p> The Democrats , he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quadrupled our national debt and tripled our annual deficit , but early enough to stop it from causing permanent disaster . " <p> That left Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , among others , fuming . McCain , who was among those who met with Clinton last week to talk about tightening up election finance laws , said he told a White House official that the speech was counterproductive and was told that the president " was tired . " <p> " Obviously , it made me very angry , especially to accuse Republicans of exploiting racial divisions in America , " McCain said in a later interview . " My response is : If you want to get the debate down in that level , I 'll argue about effective quotas and a failed welfare system designed by Democrats . " <p> For the moment , that sort of escalation was averted . Yet with heavyweight issues at stake , and congressional investigations of the Clinton White House still on the table , there is plenty of room for partisan upheaval at any time . <p> One senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look sharply divisive at times this year , but it wo n't matter as long as major legislation eventually is enacted . The end , rather than the means , will be the true measure of bipartisanship , he said . <p> " A lot of this year is going to appear unproductive and partisan , " he said . " You may end up with this bifurcated scenario  --  on the one hand , it 's bipartisan . . . and on the other hand , it may seem nastier than ever before . In the end of the day , politics is about survival . They understand what it takes to survive . And so do we . "
