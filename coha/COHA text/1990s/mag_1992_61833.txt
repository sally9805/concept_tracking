When Steve Palermo was 12 years old , growing up in Oxford , Mass. , he promised his father , Vincent , that one day he would make it to the big leagues . " Does n't every kid say that ? " Palermo asks . When he was 20 he was spotted by a major league scout while working as an umpire in a Little League game . Six years later Palermo brought his father along so they could walk down the runway together at Fenway Park in Boston the day he umpired his first big league game . // He was working third base at Fenway in 1978 when the Red Sox and the New York Yankees met in a playoff to decide the American League East champion . It was Palermo who signaled " fair ball " when the Yankees ' Bucky Dent hit a fly ball down the leftfield line and into the screen of the Green Monster for a home run . His emphatic call had , for all intents and purposes , ended the Red Sox 's season , and after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that thing fair , Stevie ? " After all the summer afternoons they had spent together at Fenway , pulling for the Sox  --  the father , the son and the holy ghost  --  how could he call it fair ? // " Dad , " Stevie replied , " it was 20 feet to the right of the pole . " // Baseball is just as often a game of 20 feet as it is of inches , and the beauty of it is you never know from one play to the next which it will be . Last summer , on the night of July 6 there were no close calls , not at third base , where Palermo was stationed for the game between the Texas Rangers and the California Angels at Arlington Stadium . Instead , Palermo , known as one of the best ball-and-strike umpires of the modern era , had eased through a quiet night at his corner of the diamond , then headed off to Campisi 's Egyptian Restaurant , a popular hangout in Dallas for sports figures that is owned by Palermo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a corner booth with Campisi and former SMU lineman Terence Mann shortly before 1 a.m. when bartender Jimmy Upton suddenly shouted that two of the restaurant 's waitresses  --  Melinda Henson and Dixie Bristow  --  were being robbed and beaten in the parking lot . When Palermo and the five other men still in the restaurant burst out the door , the three muggers quickly scattered , two of them in a car and one on foot . Mann and Palermo began to chase the runner . // It was while he was running down the darkened street after someone half his age that Palermo , who is 42 , thought , This might not be the smartest thing I 've ever done . // The chase ended when Campisi came roaring by in his Jeep , jumped out and brought the mugger down with a clothesline tackle . Mann , who is 6 ' 4 " and weighs 280 pounds , held him down while someone went to call the police . Palermo was still catching his breath when a car pulled up , the same car that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kevin Bivins stuck a pistol out the window and started firing . Bivins , who was on furlough from the Army after serving in Desert Storm , fired five times in rapid succession . Palermo thinks it was the last shot that hit him in the back . ( In November , Bivins was convicted of aggravated battery and is now serving a 75-year sentence in a Texas prison. ) // " It felt like somebody was pouring hot water on my legs , " Palermo says . " There was a warm numbness , as if I was a chocolate bar melting into the hot pavement . Then I felt for my legs and they were like two hollow logs . It was like nothing . " The bullet had entered his right side , nicking one of Palermo 's kidneys and his spinal column . " I thought I had landed on a rock , and I asked Jimmy Upton to get the rock out from under my back and let me roll over , " Palermo recalls . " I said , ' Jimmy , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell Debbie Palermo 's bride of five months I love her . And tell my parents I love them too . And my brothers and sisters . ' I was telling him who should get my golf clubs when Jimmy said , ' There 's going to be no dying here . ' " // Mann had been shot three times , in the chin , arm and thigh , but eventually made a near-complete recovery . Palermo was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital ; two days after the shooting , the neurosurgeon who operated on him told his wife and his brother Jimmy that Steve would probably never walk again . Neither one of them wanted to pass along so despairing a prognosis . " You tell him that , " Debbie angrily said to the doctor . // " When he talked to me , he tempered everything , " Steve says , " but he made it very plain there was little hope , if any . The percentages were minimal . " // It has been a year since Palermo was told he would not walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 feet to the left of the pole . It is difficult indeed to win an argument with an umpire , and Palermo is trying to make sure he gets the ump 's traditional last word . " I think that 's half the reason I 'm doing this now , " he says , gritting his teeth through another rehab workout . " Just to prove that doctor wrong . " // It has been a year taken not by days spent but by inches gained . " There are no numbers on this calendar , " Palermo says . " The clock is faceless , with no big hand , no little hand . On July 7th I 'll punch the clock , but the clock will keep on running . " // Palermo was moved to the Dallas Rehabilitation Institute ( DRI ) on July 15 , eight days after the shooting , and during the three months and 10 days he was there  --  6 hours a day , six days a week of the purest torture  --  he kept a calendar on which he marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days in black . If he was able to get out of bed and into a wheelchair , spend the 3 hours it took him to bathe , shave and dress himself , then make it down to therapy , it was a good day . " When I wanted to pull the sheet over my head and bury myself , that was a bad day , " Palermo says . // No matter what kind of day it was , Debbie was by his side . " Inch by inch , life 's a cinch , " she would tell him . " Yard by yard , life is hard . " The bullet had frayed the bundle of nerves near the base of his spine , and now they sent jolts of bright pain pulsing through his body . " You just fidget and it 's like you 're hooked up to an AC-Delco battery , " he says . " You feel like you 've got jumper cables attached to your knees . " // The doctors who know everything that is known about spinal cord injuries believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Sometimes the nerves do n't regenerate at all . Millimeter by millimeter , there is no rhyme or reason to life , there is only waiting . // Debbie had a severe case of scoliosis ( curvature of the spine ) when she was 13 , and for a year she had to wear a metal brace that ran from neck to hips . " They said I could n't be a cheerleader because I could n't do the splits , " she recalls . " Well , I was a cheerleader for four years , and that brace never kept me from doing the splits . " It was her grandmother who taught her the rhyme that has sustained her through two crises . " I 've always liked sayings , " Debbie says , " because they help explain things that ca n't be explained . " // " The body does things there 's no explanation for , " says Steve . " I was on a treadmill one day in Dallas , and I asked the therapist why my foot kept coming down the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Why does your foot come down like that ? I do n't even know why you 're walking with the level of injury you have and the muscle damage you 've had . ' Neurologically , I should n't be able to walk as well as I can . They do n't know much about this stuff . All these specialists , and they just do n't know . " // No one is certain even now of the extent of Palermo 's nerve damage . Had the .32-caliber bullet that tore through his spine been a single millimeter larger , he is told , it would have severed an artery and he would have bled to death . Had he not been bent over precisely as he was , doctors say , the bullet would have shattered his spine and he would have been in a wheelchair for life . But the truth is , they just do n't know . " They do n't know whether the bullet cut those three nerves , " Palermo says , " or whether the heat of the blast caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " I hate going out now , " he says . " People ask the same question over and over : ' How 's it coming ? ' And I tell them it 's coming . But I do n't know if it is coming . I do n't get discouraged as much as frustrated . You do n't have any control . You do the work and then wait and see if it pays off , but you never know if it will . // " Your body fights with your mind , like you 're constantly dueling with a ghost . The mind tells it what to do , but the body wo n't listen . I do n't know if my foot will hold steady . I do n't know if my leg will stay stiff and support my body . And when those things do come , they 're never good enough because they never come fast enough . " // Palermo returned to his room at the Dallas Rehabilitation Institute at 4:30 every afternoon slumped over in his wheelchair from exhaustion . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But every day when I got back to my room , the letters would be there waiting . " So many letters and telegrams from well-wishers poured into DRI that Palermo was able to completely paper his walls with them . During the first few months after the shooting , the pain in his legs was so intense that it woke him up repeatedly during the night . Often he would turn on the light in his room and see the handwriting on the wall . " If I ca n't make it back for myself , " he would tell himself as he drifted off to sleep , " I 'm going to make it back for all these people . " // Who among us can ever really know how much we are liked or admired while we are alive to enjoy it ? And how many umpires can , for goodness sake ? Like Tom Sawyer attending his own funeral , Palermo was startled to learn that so many people cared . " They say you 're lucky if you can count your friends on more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of hands . " // For a while it seemed he would get a hand whenever he left the institute . One night during his final month of rehabilitation in Dallas , he and Debbie went out for dinner ; after they entered the restaurant , people suddenly started to applaud , then rose to their feet and continued to cheer . Palermo wanted to turn and run , then remembered he had braces on both legs and was walking with crutches . " I 've been running away from recognition all of my professional life , " he says . " I never wanted to be recognized for what I did . " // This was not entirely a matter of modesty , for it is a maxim of umpiring that when an ump goes unnoticed , it means he has done his job well . " The cheering and the clapping for me stopped 21 years ago when I became an umpire , " he says . " This adulation goes against everything that 's been ingrained in me . I 'm used to people threatening me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , Palermo was asked to appear at a press conference to publicly answer questions about the shooting for the first time . It came as no surprise to him when many of the questions that day centered on how Palermo felt about being a hero . It did surprise him , however , when reporters stood and applauded him after the session . // Palermo has seen himself transformed in the public eye from a man whose only disability was presumed to be occasional occupational blindness to a man who is some kind of hero riding out of Texas on a gleaming white wheelchair . It is an image that makes him cringe . " All that hero talk , that 's bull , " he says . " Hero is a word I do n't wear well . There were six guys who did what I did that night , and none of us went out that door trying to make our mark as heroes . What about the four guys who did n't get shot ? I guess they 're smart heroes . " // Palermo had heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rehab center . His sudden separation from the game had made it too painful for him to watch baseball on TV  --  until , that is , he started to get regular visits from two of his fellow rehab patients , eight-year-old Cody Edmonson and 11-year-old Mitchell Wentling , who sneaked out of the pediatrics ward to see the umpire who got shot . " They 'd climb in bed with me , and then the nurses would bring them ice cream and cookies , " Palermo says . " What could I do ? They 'd flip on a game and start asking me about the players . Then after the game they 'd take off , and I 'd be sleeping in ice cream and crumbs . " // The boys had suffered head injuries so severe that neither had been expected to survive . They survived . Doctors said Cody , whose foot had gotten caught in a stirrup while he was calf-roping , would n't live through the first night . He remained in a coma for several days . " Cody talked in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , " Palermo says , " but on him it sounded good . He would say , ' Wheeerrre youuuu gooooin ' , Steeeeve ? ' when I was taking my baby steps on the treadmill . Cody always wanted to race me . " It was during his races with an eight-year-old that Palermo 's competitive juices began to stir again . // " As good as Stevie was for those kids , " Debbie says , " they were better for him . " Mitchell , who had been hit by a car while riding his bike , would cruise around the hospital in his wheelchair , always wearing an Oakland A 's cap that manager Tony La Russa had sent to Palermo . He loved the cap so much that he insisted on wearing it during an outing to a Rangers game at Arlington Stadium . " I told him , " Palermo says , " ' Mitch , bad move . This is Rangers country . You 're going to get another head injury . ' " He wore the hat . // During his stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year-old boy named Jonathan every day . " And then one day he was n't there anymore , " Palermo says . " I asked what happened to him , and they said his insurance had run out . I said , ' A five-year-old boy with a head injury ca n't stay here because he has no insurance ? That 's crazy . ' " // The Palermos decided to try do something for future Jonathans . They organized a benefit auction of baseball memorabilia and autographs ; on the afternoon of Oct. 5 , virtually all the players from the Rangers and the A 's pitched in and helped raise $125,000 , which was used as seed money to start the Steve Palermo Foundation for Spinal Cord Injuries . // That night Palermo walked , with crutches , onto the field at Arlington Stadium with his former regular umpiring crew ; as he went to home plate to collect the lineup cards , he was given a lengthy standing ovation. // Palermo threw out the first pitch at the World Series last fall  --  a reminder to himself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home to Overland Park , Kans. , and resumed his workouts at the Mid-America Rehabilitation Hospital . Last month his recovery had progressed to the point where his doctor suggested that he reduce his rehab schedule from five days a week to three , that it was time for him to get on with his life . " But how are you supposed get back to the real world ? " Palermo asks . " What is the real world ? My world was umpiring baseball games , but that 's gone now , and so the world changes . Something like this just devastates your life . " // Still , the signs of progress are real , even tangible . He has kept the hip-to-toe metal brace that he wore on his left leg in Dallas when he made his first tottering steps . " We have n't figured out what we 're going to do with it yet , " he says . " We might put it in the front yard and make a planter out of it . " // Now his rehab days begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there he works with therapists he describes as " terrorists , " who help him stretch and strengthen the muscles in his legs . By 10:30 a.m. he is in the gym , walking between parallel bars , his fingertips gliding over the wooden railings as he places his right foot in front of the left , heel to toe , seven steps . He stops to think , then turns and walks the seven paces back again . This time only the backs of his hands make contact with the railings . " You used to white-knuckle those bars , " therapist Bobbi Arp tells him . After a few minutes of this , Palermo emerges from the parallel bars aided only by a cane . // This is a place where real miracles happen , not ballpark-variety miracles and not by the laying on of hands . Eight months ago Palermo could n't raise his legs an inch while lying on his back . Now , with his fists doubled at his side and his face contorted with effort , the right foot rises six inches . The left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees and ankles feel as if they are in a constant viselike grip because the nerves are firing all the time . He is acutely aware now of where all the nerves and muscles in his legs are . // In the afternoon , he does exercises to strengthen his back , which was strained long before the shooting by years of leaning over catchers ' shoulders . It is the back injury , he says , that may have slowed his progress , delaying him , perhaps , from turning his crutches into some new form of lawn sculpture . // When Lou Piniella was playing for the New York Yankees , he once challenged Palermo on a called strike . " Where was that pitch at ? " Piniella asked defiantly . Palermo replied that a man playing in Yankee Stadium , who was ennobled by the same pinstripes worn by Ruth and DiMaggio , should know better than to end a sentence with a preposition . " O.K. , " Piniella countered . " Where was that pitch at , asshole ? " // Palermo always understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing Socratic exchanges that gave him his moral weight . " Baseball is a game of questions and answers , " former umpire Nestor Chylak once told Palermo . " They 're going to have the questions , and you 'd better have the answers . " // There are more questions than ever now , but Palermo still believes he has the answers . He will be back , if not this year , then next . " It 's not denial if you 're right , " he says . " If not next year , then the one after that . " There are no numbers on his calendar now , only inches marked off in the colors of a rainbow , its arc rising and the end still not in sight .
