Now you listen , Missy ! " Joan Rivers playfully commands her 25-year-old daughter after a long day at the studio . " I 'm giving you a sex video that somebody was plugging on my show today . You 've got to see this tape ! A woman should be good in every aspect of her life ! " " Mother ! " cries the dismayed Melissa , in town on a visit from Los Angeles . " You start on sex and I am running from the room ! " The room in question happens to be the dining room of Rivers 's $1.6 million Manhattan triplex , but it could just as easily have been the master bath . " We 've always had these long talks while one of us is in the tub , " explains Rivers , who was 60 on June 8 . " It 's very private , and nobody can interrupt us . " It 's hard to imagine a closer mother-daughter bond than one in which nothing comes between the two but soap bubbles . And theirs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to a genetic affinity for talking , Joan and Melissa share a love of theater ( " I would take her with me before she could sit on the seat , " says Joan ) , books ( " I 've read every Princess Diana book , " says Melissa ) and exercise ( " all due to Melissa , " admits Joan , who follows her daughter 's healthy lead and does a combination of treadmill , floor exercises and weights six times a week ) . These days the two even share a career path . Melissa , who last year had her own two-minute gossip segments on Hangin ' with MTV and covered 1993 spring break for the cable channel , is now reporting youth-oriented stories for both MTV and CBS This Morning . She is also negotiating a late-night talk show of her own with Maverick , Madonna 's company ( " I am beyond excited about it , " she says ) . Joan has her four-year-old daily syndicated talk show , The Joan Rivers Show , on 140 stations nationwide , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA Network with the in-your-face title Gossip ! Gossip ! Gossip ! Moreover , Joan has kissed and made up with Barry Diller , who was president of Fox Network in 1987 when she was very publicly fired from her own late-night talk show a mere six months after its debut . Now , as the CEO of the QVC Network , Diller provides her with a berth to sell her Joan Rivers Classics jewelry ( estimated 1992 sales : $25 million ) . Joan also is developing a one-woman off-Broadway show based on the life of comic Sally Marr  --  comedian Lenny Bruce 's mother  --  that she hopes will be on the boards this winter . Not all is toil , though : Later this month , mother and daughter are planning a trip together to St. Petersburg , Russia , to attend a Faberge exhibit . After that they will go ballooning in Normandy with the family of Malcolm Forbes . But the warm feelings and good times are relatively recent  --  and hard-earned . For a year after Joan 's husband and Melissa 's father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the desolate mother and furious daughter did n't get along at all . " The way I see it , " explains Joan , " Melissa blamed me . " After all , Joan and Edgar had only recently separated when he killed himself . " But , " says Joan , " she was n't going to turn to me by the casket and say , " You killed Daddy ! ' ' " Instead , Joan says , anger simmered under the surface as the two " tried to go on with our own lives and were both so broken that we could n't help each other . " Joan , who divided her time between her home in Bel Air and a hotel in Manhattan while Melissa was still in Philadelphia attending the University of Pennsylvania , remembers it as a time when " I was totally alone , with no career , no husband , no child . I did n't know what I was going to do . I really thought about suicide myself . " For her part , Melissa avoided Joan , blaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what my mother was feeling , " she says . " It was her problem . I was going through my own thing . " Meanwhile , a tailspinning Joan became bulimic for the first time ever , and the disorder remained with her for six months . After months of depression and isolation , though , she pulled herself together by returning to work on Broadway in Broadway Bound and moving into a brand-new luxury apartment that was mercifully free of doleful memories . As therapy after Rosenberg 's suicide , she decorated with gilt and antiques in the manner of a mini Versailles , envisioning " what Marie Antoinette would have done if she had taste . " The grand triplex even boasts a cheerfully decorated one-bedroom apartment on the first floor that is reserved for her daughter 's use during visits . " Even at the worst time , we would always speak , " says Rivers . " I decided that for Melissa 's sake I had to keep going . Otherwise , I would give her the same message as Edgar  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had to see me climb out of the well . " Immediately after Edgar 's suicide , mother and daughter began  --  at Joan 's insistence  --  an eight-month stint of psychotherapy , both separately and together , in L.A. and Philadelphia . Only after this process was well under way could they put aside their hostility and begin to renew their relationship . " One day , after a session , " recalls Joan , " Melissa said , " Let 's have coffee . " But I could n't . I was too wiped . That was the lowest point for me . " Melissa remembers a different low . She was heading to their L.A. home from school for the weekend , and Joan could n't pick her up at the airport because she had guests . Melissa went wild with anger . " Mind you , " she now says with a wry smile , " my parents had never picked me up , and it was no big deal . But this time I thought , " If my mother 's not there , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but I made everyone miserable . " The relationship continued along its rocky course until " something terrible and traumatic happened to me , " says Melissa . At a particularly vulnerable point  --  three months after her father 's suicide  --  she began to date a fellow student at Penn and suddenly found herself " in an abusive relationship . " At the time , she says , " I was so far gone emotionally that I do n't know if I was allowing myself to physically feel the pain . " She stayed with him through two ugly incidents  --  Melissa refuses to discuss the specifics  --  but the third time , she says , was the last straw . " I realized that I had a lot more to offer than to have someone hit me , " she explains , " and I just said , " This is it . " It made me realize what I had  --  and the thing I had and will always have is my mother . She was right there for me . " Joan remembers Melissa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mother , do n't worry , he pushed my face into glass , but I did n't cut my eye . ' I wanted to take that son of a bitch and kill him , but I could n't say that to her . " Nor could she tell Melissa not to go back to him . " But I asked her to remember that if she did , she was opening a door to that kind of abuse for the rest of her life . This was her battle . I allowed her to make the choice . " And Melissa was grateful . " She did n't condemn me . She never asked me , " How could you have gone back to him ? ' ' " she says . " She just said , " Okay , this is the situation . Let 's deal with it . ' ' " " We had to go through the bad times , but we came out of them , " says Joan . The pair reconciled , and at her daughter 's urging , Joan gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Pennsylvania in 1989 ( Melissa graduated with a degree in European history ) . In the middle of the speech , Joan broke into tears as she told the crowd , " I 'm so proud of my daughter . " Today , her eyes moist with emotion , Joan says simply , " Melissa and I are truly good friends now . " Adds Melissa : " We 're each other 's sounding boards . We really talk things out . " On this sun-strewn morning , mother and daughter sit in Joan 's peach-colored dining room , picking at crumb cake and sipping decaf coffee ( Joan , who has a heart arrhythmia , does n't keep a caffeinated bean in the house ) served from a silver tea service by a formally attired butler . Gazing at her decor , Joan laughs . " There are certain celebrities you say thank God for ! Yoko Ono . Leona Helmsley . Tammy Faye Bakker . I got my mileage on Tammy Faye . Melissa , she bought us this dining room . " " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in the Top 40 , " says Melissa , who rents a three-bedroom , Mediterranean-style house outside L.A. Claiming she changed her last name to Rivers in December 1989 not because it would give her a career boost but because it was easier to spell than Rosenberg , Melissa also insists that connections did n't get her her first break as MTV 's resident gossip . She says , rather , that she owes it all to propitious seating . " At an L.A. charity dinner for the homeless , " she explains , " I sat next to a woman who was a producer for MTV . " One thing led to another , and several months later Melissa wound up with her gig . It seems only appropriate that mother should provide inspiration for daughter . From the time Melissa was 2 , she watched Joan perfect her harshly innovative comedy routine . The tot would sit in the wings of nightclubs like the one at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and wave to her mother , who stood center stage performing her routine . " By age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbatim . She 'd say , " I hate to cook . I hate to clean . Housework is stupid . No woman was ever made love to because she scrubbed the linoleum . ' ' " That only endeared Melissa more to her mother . Even while Edgar was alive , Joan has said , " Melissa is the one to whom I could give total affection and feel it being absorbed and returned . " Indeed , despite Joan 's career drive , she says she has always valued family above all else . " I wish I had had 10 children , " she says . " After Missy , I had two miscarriages and a tubular pregnancy . Not having more is my only regret in life . We were going to adopt , and then Edgar changed his mind . I worry now because there 's nobody for Missy . When the chips are down , the only one who will take you in is a relative . " When Melissa was growing up , both Joan and Edgar , who was also Joan 's manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the road doing nightclub gigs . " Mom and Dad would fly in from wherever for even minor school events , " recalls Melissa , who attended a trio of private schools in Southern California . Confirms Joan : " I was even a Brownie troop mother . Now that was a picture . " Despite all the privileges of Joan 's stardom , raising a daughter in Beverly Hills was n't easy . For Melissa , unfortunately , childhood meant struggling to live up to images of youthful perfection . " I always wanted to be tall and blond , " she says , " and I 'm still having trouble with that . " Explains Joan : " Melissa grew up in a society where everyone who walked in the door was beautiful . Nicollette Sheridan went to her school . Missy always felt short and squat , but we constantly told her , " You 're the best ! Go for it ! " In third-grade swim meets she was 3 ' ' 2 " while other kids were 6 ' ' 2 " . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' " But Joan purposely chose schools that were not filled with the scions of show business . " I wanted her to see that other kids ' fathers are doctors and businessmen , " says Joan . And there were family rules : When Joan and Edgar were in town , the family had dinner at 6 p.m . During the meal , all phones would be shut off . Then they would talk about everything  --  school and work , life and art , business problems and solutions . " We wanted Melissa to know about the good times and the bad , " Joan says . Rivers was also hip to her daughter 's most sensitive needs . When Melissa acquired her first serious beau and asked for contraceptives at age 17 , Joan took her to the gynecologist . " And then I slipped her $250 for a hotel room so that it would n't happen in the backseat of a car , " she admits . " It 's tricky because you know you 're opening up a can of worms . Melissa was starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is this boy nice for her ? " But at least she was going to have safe sex . " Yet even the open-minded Joan could be pushed too far . Says Melissa : " I rebelled late . I was 16 . " The catalyst was not sex or drugs . It was college . While Joan , who had graduated from Barnard College , and the British-reared Rosenberg , who had graduated from Cambridge , wanted their daughter to go to school in the East , Melissa lobbied for UCLA  --  and lost . One night the discussion got so heated that she blew her cool and stormed out of the house . " Think carefully before you leave , " her mother called after her . " You can not come back until you 're invited ! " That night , Melissa , who had ended up at the house of Joan 's personal assistant , phoned home . Joan had to steel herself as she reiterated , " You 're not invited back . " But the tough-love tactic worked . " When she said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized what I had done . " After spending two nights away , the chastened daughter called again  --  as Joan had suspected she would . This time her mother did invite her back . Melissa promptly sent in her application to Penn . " It was just an application , " she explains , defending her actions . " It did n't mean I had to go . " But of the schools that accepted her , Penn was the most highly ranked . The only sparks that fly these days , mother and daughter say , are those kindled by their gentle ribbing . Melissa provokes her mother by describing Joan 's beloved Yorkshire terrier , Spike , as " a tall rat . " Joan , on the other hand , gets Melissa 's dander up with public conversation about her daughter 's personal life . Once , Rivers had TV viewers call a 900 number and vote on whether or not Melissa should buy a convertible . ( The verdict : Go for it . But Melissa did n't , after Joan 's security consultant phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to set you up with one of those 21 Jump Street guys , " Joan says as Melissa rolls her eyes . " And what about the boy whose father owns North Carolina ? " Melissa , however , is n't much taken with dating . " It 's tough , and I do n't really like it , " she says . She describes her current beau , from San Diego , as " someone fun to hang out with . " Though she refuses to identify him , she acknowledges that " he has nothing to do with television  --  that 's one of the reasons I like him . " Still , she adds cautiously , " It 's all very casual . " Has Joan met the new man in her daughter 's life ? Yes , says Missy  --  and she likes him too . Yet whether or not mother and daughter agree on candidates for Melissa 's future , they certainly disagree about the courtship itself . Looking her daughter in the eye across her dining-room table , the concerned mother advises , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're married first . " Melissa has heard this before and is unmoved . " I believe that before you marry , you should live together , " she replies firmly . " Never ! " cries the doting mom . " I 'm sorry , you can have a romance with somebody , but you do n't move in and do his laundry until after you 're married . " Melissa would advise Joan differently . " She thinks I should live with a man , but not get married , " says her mother . " I think Missy 's happy when she knows I 'm going out and not sitting home . But I do n't date much . One guy was so old he picked me up in a hearse . " In fact , Joan had a serious suitor , but she broke up with him last December . " He was n't right for me , " she says . " Now I 'm fancy-free , and it 's horrible . " During the breakup , Melissa flew to New York City to comfort her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked to . " At this point Joan reserves her romantic fantasies for her daughter . " She will have a dream wedding , " she says . " It will be very elegant and very formal . Black tie . " " Oh , no , " counters Melissa . " I 'd rather run off to Vegas  --  that chapel near the Riviera Hotel . " The two laugh . They 've played this song before . " She does n't have a choice , " Joan insists . " It 'll be something like the Metropolitan Club . Lester Lanin will play " You 're the Top , " and we 'll two-step around the room . " Melissa sighs and shrugs . " There are some things in life I 'm resigned to , " she says lightly . " You know , " says Joan , as she cuts a last sliver of crumb cake , " I always wanted us to be as close as I was to my mother . But now I think I have it better because we 're much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I still ca n't talk to her about sex . And I never will . " <p>
