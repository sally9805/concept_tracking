Contents* * * HELLO JAKE # " DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFOS ? " <p> No , dammit . I do n't believe in anything that has n't been parked in my driveway so I could kick the tires and check the gearshift . So do n't ask again . Just because I 'm a science fiction writer does n't mean I 'm demented . I have no time for crop circles , telepathy , alien abductions , power centers , spontaneous combustion , or ancient astronauts . Loch Ness is empty , Atlantis is bunk , and I 'll sleep in any haunted house in the world for five hundred bucks plus expenses . Okay ? <p> I mention this up front because I attended a seminar this past summer during which I may have touched the infinite . And I know how that sounds . But I want to avoid your saying well , after all this is Jake Cobblemere , he writes all those stories about nine travelers and rubber dimensions , so what do you expect ? If you want to believe I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude all this just bubbled up out of my workday habits . Because that is n't what happened . <p> Not at all . <p> Last spring I got a call from Sam Wynn inviting me to participate as an advisor at the Baranov Seminar , which is conducted annually at the Skyhawk Conference Center in upstate New York . You might have heard of it . The participants refer to themselves as Baranovians . They 're science fiction enthusiasts who meet for a few days every summer to renew old acquaintances and do the SF equivalent of a mystery weekend . They bring in a writer and maybe an outside expert to put together a simulation for them . The previous summer , for example , they converted Skyhawk into Moonbase and staged a murder . One of the guests was the New York City medical examiner . ( The murderer , by the way , turned out to be the computer , a la Hal . ) <p> The seminars have been running since 1971 , when Abraham Baranov personally launched them , discovered how engaging they were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I need not tell you , a signal honor to be asked to step briefly into the great man 's shoes . <p> " This year they want to do a Martian dig , " Sam told me . He explained that the group decides each summer what sort of program they 'll do the following year . " We 've got Marsbase up and running . We 've been there for a while , taking soil samples and whatnot , and we discover some artifacts . " <p> " Artifacts ? " I said . " What sort of artifacts ! " <p> " That 's up to you , Jake . " <p> " But Mars is dead . Has been for a couple of billion years , except maybe for the microbes . How could there be artifacts ? " <p> " Your problem , Jake . Come up with something . And listen , we 're giving you a professional archaeologist to work with . " <p> " Okay , " I said , warming to the idea . " Does the archaeologist write science fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she 's a friend of mine , she 's available , and she offered to come no charge . " <p> " What am I supposed to do with an archaeologist ? " <p> " They want to do an actual dig . She knows how . " <p> " I thought this would be a simulation . " <p> " Oh , no . There 'll be a real dig site . We 've set aside some ground . You 're going to bury the artifacts , and the team will dig them up and try to solve the mystery . " <p> " What mystery ? " <p> " Invent one . " <p> The archaeologist was Maureen Coverdale . She worked out of Penn , and I lived in Indianapolis , so we did all the planning on-line . She surprised me . I guess I 'd expected that she would treat the whole thing more or less as an excuse to get a free vacation , but she took it all very seriously . She kept after me , pointing out that Martian artifacts could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a clear obligation to make sure the Baranovians got their money 's worth . <p> She turned out to be twenty years younger than I 'd expected , darkeyed , trim , a woman who looked as if she 'd be more at home among soft blue lights than digging up broken pots . But I dreamed up a story line and we agreed on what we needed to do . She took charge of manufacturing the stuff we needed . She showed up two days before the program was to start , supervised the Skyhawk earthmover , buried everything , and was waiting ( with Sam Wynn ) to shake my hand when I arrived late , having underestimated the driving time on a series of winding roads . <p> We retired to The Hawk 's Nest and reviewed our plans over rum and Coke . Then we walked out to the dig site , which was located about a quarter mile from Harper Hall . ( Harper would serve as the team 's mobile field station . ) The site was about sixteen feet on a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baranovians here yet ? " I asked . <p> " Some are , " said Sam . " Most of them will straggle in during the night . " He consulted a clipboard . " Altogether , we 'll have twenty-four . " <p> Skyhawk is located in deep forest on the shores of a glacial lake . Green-carpeted mountains rise on all sides . On that first night there was a brilliant full moon , the wind was loud in the spruce , and the woods smelled of mint and cold water . A half-dozen lights lined the far shore . Nothing could have been farther from Mars . <p> Warren Hatch was glad to get off his hands and knees , and give his place to Judy Conroy . " I never knew archaeology was so mind-numbing , " he told Maureen . A dozen or so members of the team were working meticulously over the site , removing the crumbly Martian soil a half-inch at a time , brushing it off rocks , turning it over to others who strained it to ensure nothing was being overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " To buried temples ? Secret doors ? That sort of thing ? " <p> Maureen smiled . " Real archaeology would make a slow movie , " she said . <p> Warren looked out past the dig site , through the plasteel shell that shielded them from the near-vacuum . Low red hills rose in the north , and he could see a dune buggy moving across the horizon . <p> " Got something here . " Patti Kubik 's voice . She brushed the object and held it up . It was a knife . Long and slightly curved , it had a metal blade and handle , and was still in good condition . <p> " No telling how old it is , " said Cobblemere . " It could have been in the ground for centuries without showing any real deterioration . " <p> They noted where the knife had been found , recorded the coordinates on a chart , and placed it beside the two urns they 'd recovered earlier . <p> " Here . Look at this . " Eddie Edwards , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was on his knees , rear end stuck up , face red with effort , working with brush and fingers to clear a rectangular tablet about the size of a dinner plate . " It 's got a picture on it , " he said . That brought a crowd . <p> The tablet depicted a vaguely reptilian-looking creature with long teeth and crocodilian eyes . The stuff of bad science fiction films . For all that , it maintained an aspect that seemed almost pious . It wore a robe , and it seemed to have just dropped an object that might have been a stone or a crumpled piece of paper . A jagged line resembling a lightning bolt was drawn through the dropped object . A string of exotic characters lined the top and right side of the tablet . <p> " This ca n't be right , " said Jason Kelly , the team 's senior member in terms of age and service . Kelly was almost seventy , but he was a physical fitness freak and he could probably have run most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's lone exobiologist . " It 's a hoax . Has to be . " <p> " Why ? " asked Warren . <p> " If this is supposed to be a Martian , it 's all wrong . Martians could n't possibly look like this . These creatures would have evolved in a swampy environment . " <p> " Here 's another . " Murray Fineberg , this time . Murray was middle-aged , overweight , a man who looked as if he would have been more at home running a publishing business than kneeling in Martian silt . His tablet revealed the same sort of crocodilian creature , this time bowing before a pyramid from which lines of light seemed to emanate . <p> " It just does n't figure , " said Jason . " We know surface conditions were never adequate to support anything more complicated than a bacterium . " <p> " Then why , " asked Patti Kubik , " are we out here in the first place ? " Patti was middle-aged , prematurely gray , possibly the most personable individual on Mars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egomaniacs , she managed to maintain a good-humored humility . " We 're all idiots much of the time , " she 'd told Warren once . " If you recognize that , it explains a lot . " <p> Sam Wynn was wearing a headset . He was tall , thoughtful , deliberate , dressed in an ivory-colored jacket with an Oakland Raiders logo . His brows drew suddenly together and he pressed both earphones . After a moment he nodded and then called for attention . " I 've got some news , " he said . " The Delta team just found two metal disks on the North Ridge . They 're approximately five meters in diameter , and they 're mounted on cradles that permit both lateral and horizontal movement . " <p> " Sounds like satellite dishes , " said Bryan Trahan . Bryan was among the younger members of the team . He was in his early twenties , a seven-footer , quiet , ungainly , with clear handsome features and bright green eyes . <p> " That 's what Clan coy thinks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " So where are the satellites ? " asked Patti . <p> " Negative , " said Sam . " No satellites . We know that for a fact . " <p> Eddie pushed his thick fingers into the soil and nodded to himself . " Another tablet , " he said . <p> There was more : pots , cups , primitive tools . More tablets . Beads . Jewelry . A paperweight-sized pyramid that might have been made of diamond . ( The diamond , if indeed that 's what it was , had a scarlet tinge in its depths . ) And a long metallic rod with markings , not unlike a gauge . They also dug up a strip of cable that appeared to be made of plastic . Odd . <p> At the edge of the excavation , they found the remains of a wall . The wall was a high-tech alloy , and must once have enclosed the site , even as their own plasteel dome now sealed it off . <p> Sam was listening to his earphones again . He was frowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've got something else . " He raised his voice so all could hear . " CNN reports that somebody blew up Union Station in Chicago . During rush hour . They 've got several hundred dead . Almost a thousand people hurt . " It was the latest in a wave of terrorist attacks by all kinds of disgruntled groups . Anybody with a grudge and enough money to buy a bombmaker could now make his irritation felt . ( His was the correct usage , because to date no women had been charged . ) <p> " Mars is starting to look good . " Judy Conroy was from Chicago . She was diminutive , with classic features and dark brown hair , cropped in a pageboy . Her blue eyes , which were usually bright and penetrating , smoldered . <p> " Crazies everywhere , " said Warren . Two weeks earlier , one group had bombed a nuclear power plant upwind of New York City in an unsuccessful effort to cause a meltdown . <p> " What 's this ? " asked Murray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone surface . <p> " Careful , " said Maureen . <p> It was roughly one by three meters . Maureen took over direction , and within an hour they 'd uncovered a table with a solid base about a meter and a half deep . <p> " You know what it looks like ? " said Bryan . <p> " Yeah . " Murray rubbed his hand across his balding scalp . " It looks like an altar . " <p> Warren knelt down to examine it . It was stained . <p> " I think we 're off to a good start , " said Maureen . She sliced a strip off her steak , tasted it , and nodded her approval . We 'd secured a comer table , away from the Baranovians . Down on the beach , a few die-hard bathers were still in the water , even though the evening was turning cool . <p> " We should be , " I said . Her artifacts had been damned good . " How long did it take you to bury the stuff ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marked the dig site . The ground was muddy . Unfortunately , the dome that held back the Martian vacuum could not keep out a terrestrial rainstorm . They 'd all got drenched , and some had even retreated back to the dining hall or their individual quarters . ( An outdoor wedding had also taken a hit that afternoon . ) But a half-dozen of the hardier Baranovians had hung on , cutting down through the soil until the urns and tools and gadgets had been recovered and recorded . And until the altar lay exposed . <p> There 'd been visitors . Neighbors of Skyhawk , and guests from the wedding party , all curious as to why these people were digging a large hole in the lawn , had gathered outside the perimeter . Sam had set himself to intercept them , to keep them at a distance . He 'd answered their questions as best he could . Some had seemed interested ; others had smiled and retreated . <p> " The blood on the altar , " Sam said . " That 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Only Maureen and I knew the scenario . " You think it 's blood ? " I asked innocently . <p> " Sure , " he said . " What else ? I 've seen your work , Jake . You never miss a chance to spill blood . " <p> I was hurt by the comment , and I was trying to think how to respond when Bryan joined us . His plate was heaped high with roast beef and mashed potatoes . " Interesting afternoon , " he said from his height up near the ceiling . " Do you expect we 'll be able to finish with the dig tomorrow ? " <p> Maureen was slow to respond , and it occurred to me she liked Bryan . She was trying not to show it , but her eyes grew luminous and her color changed . " Yes , " she said finally . " If we were doing this in realtime , this kind of excavation might take weeks . But we 'll wrap it up about noon . " <p> " Then what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " we 'll withdraw into the field station and try to see what we have . " <p> Bryan was wearing a T-shirt with a silhouette of Abraham Baranov , the dates of the seminar , and the motto Mars or Bust . Several of the participants had them by now . He nodded , tried the roast beef , stirred some sweetener into his iced tea , and buttered a roll . " When do we get to the AI ? " he asked . <p> Startled , I looked suspiciously at Maureen . She shook her head no . She had n't told him . But nobody else knew the scenario . <p> " Bryan , what makes you think there 's an AI ? " <p> " Well , " he said , " I do n't see where else you could go with all this . Anyway , I 've read your work . " He shrugged . <p> I was insulted again . But I hid my feelings behind a casual smile . " There are all kinds of possibilities , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a half hour later , she let her dismay show . " What do we do ? " she asked . <p> I 'd been thinking about little else . " It 's too late to change the scenario . We 'll stay with it . " <p> But I did n't sleep well that night . Sam had suggested I was predictable . Bryan had demonstrated it . <p> The field station consisted of dormitory-style sleeping quarters for eight , a lab , a maintenance shack , a kitchen and dining room , a communication center , and a rec room . Additional support modules had been established outside . Their domes gleamed in the ruddy sunlight . <p> In the morning , there was fresh news : preliminary analysis of the North Ridge disks suggested they had been electrically powered . Two more had been found ; and they were all in a straight line , approximately fifty meters apart . <p> Sam , manning the radio console , picked up a series of UPI Worldline bulletins that suggested the Earthside situation was deteriorating . President Martin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mobilized the entire array of federal agencies in the effort . In a related development , the Congress passed a joint resolution calling for a mandatory death penalty for anyone convicted of a terror crime , or for any accessories in a terror crime . The President , vacationing at the Tampa White House , was quoted as saying he might consider calling for a suspension of habeas corpus until calm had been restored . <p> That all seemed far away . Warren thought how well distance lends perspective . The home world was a violent , angry place . And somehow , against the eternally placid stars , its virulence was more apparent . And less real . <p> Meantime , the team had spent the morning at the site , where they 'd unearthed several more tablets , some with images , some without . All had inscriptions . The characters were unlike anything Warren had seen before , little more than squiggles and dots . But Judy said she though t they had enough to attempt a translation . <p> " How do we even begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " it might be fairly easy . We should be able to assume the text is connected to the images . So first we try to figure out what the images are about . " <p> There were eleven tablets . Eight had images ; all had inscriptions . The reptilian figure was portrayed in various poses : it gazed contemplatively past the observer 's shoulder ; it walked casually through a corridor ; it drank from a flagon , through which a lightning strike passed ; it even leaned casually against a wall , as if waiting for a bus . ( In the latter depiction , the lightning was again present , this time a bolt drawn diagonally across the lizard itself . ) <p> " Hey , " said Sam , pulling his earphones down around his neck . " They took out the Holland Tunnel . " <p> " Blew it up ? " <p> " Yeah . During rush hour . They 've got a couple thousand casualties . " <p> They stood around for a time in stunned silence , the curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if they ever knew what kind of neighbors they had . " <p> A half hour later , Sam announced that a lab report had come back on the altar stains . " There 's DNA , " he said , " and plasma , oxygen , fructose , proteins , urea  --  " <p> " Blood , " said Patti . <p> Sam shook his head . " They 're saying there are some differences , but it 's a decent approximation . " <p> Meantime , Murray thought he had the meaning of one of the tablets  --  the one with the creature leaning against the wall . " No loitering " he said . " And this one , no littering . " <p> Somebody laughed . Snorted . But every image with a lightning bolt contained the same cluster of characters at the beginning . Do not  --  ? Warren knew instinctively that Murray was right . But he was disappointed that the first other-worldly translation would be so prosaic . No littering . My God . <p> Toward the end of the afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers . <p> They worked through dinner , reading increasingly ominous bulletins , which Sam was now posting . The FBI were rounding up suspects . The National Guard had been placed on standby . The President , promising action against " cowards , " made good on his threat to suspend habeas corpus . The ACLU warned against overreacting . <p> Meantime , Mars Central reported that the North Ridge disks had moved ! Three had rotated and now seemed to be tracking the sun . ( The fourth was apparently not functional . ) Warren had just begun to digest the implications when another bulletin arrived : electrical power was being collected by the disks and relayed below ground . <p> " What 's down there ? " asked Judy . <p> " They 've finally got around to ordering a radar survey , " said Sam , pressing one earphone down . <p> Murray 's team produced an alphabet for the alien script , and constructed a model syntax . Warren worked with them for a while , but they were too quick for him . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This , " he told Judy , indicating the pyramid tablet . " The pyramid has to be something special . It puts off light rays . And look at the Martian 's attitude . " <p> " It 's almost religious , " she said . Judy 's group had been cataloging and analyzing the other artifacts . <p> " That might be a leap , " said Bryan . " After all , these are alien icons . I think we should go slow trying to read nonverbal cues . " <p> Judy picked up the pyramid and compared it to the one in the image . " It 's the same object . " <p> " I think you 're right , " said Warren . <p> She held it at eye level and stared at it . " What are you ? " she asked . <p> It was getting late . " We 'll pick it up from there tomorrow , " I told them . " But I want to congratulate you . We did n't think anybody was going to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers on the table and glanced around at the five people who had been working with him on the tablets . " We thought we 'd stay on awhile , " he said . " We 're close to a breakthrough . " <p> But I did n't want anyone getting ahead of the program . " Let it go , folks . We 'll get back at it in the morning . " <p> They grumbled and picked up some notes and I knew damned well they were going to find a place and keep working . But I was n't brought in to police these people , and they could n't take the tablets with them , so there was a limit to how much progress they could make . <p> Skyhawk maintained The Hawk 's Nest , a bar and recreation lounge next door to Harper Hall , which filled quickly with the Baranovians . They drifted by and talked about books they 'd recently read , or about recent advances in one area or another , or just how good ( or poor ) the drinks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exercise with us . " It 's not considered kosher , " Sam said . " Not after hours . " I wondered how Bryan had missed it . <p> After a while Maureen and I withdrew to talk about the next day 's scenario . <p> I have to make a confession of sorts here . Maureen had caught my eye right at the start . By the end of the second day I felt positioned to try to implement some dishonorable intentions , so when she started toward the office we 'd been using in the Long Elm Building , I steered us instead toward the lake-front . <p> She looked surprised but said nothing . We congratulated each other on the good job we were doing . The wind was loud in the trees and somewhere a radio was playing . Exactly the right sort of music for a moonlit night and a beautiful woman . " You have lovely eyes , Maureen , " I told her . <p> Her lips curved into a smile . " I thought science fiction writers were above this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stride . The truth was that I could n't even see her eyes in the shadows . I struggled to come up with an appropriate response . Something witty . If you can make a woman laugh , I 'd always noticed , everything else becomes a lot easier . But she 'd turned away from me and was looking out toward the lake . Along the shoreline , there were a couple of docks and a boathouse and a few benches . Someone was sitting on one of the benches . <p> " It 's Bryan , " she said . " What 's he doing out there by himself ? " <p> I shrugged . " I guess he wants some time alone . " <p> " I guess , " she said . " But the whole point of coming here 's to party , is n't it ? Especially for a guy his age . " <p> There was something disconsolate in his appearance , a distortion in the geometry of body to bench to moonlight . I could see that Maureen felt it too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at one another , and I read the unasked question in her face , whether we should go over ; and I saw the answer in her eyes . If he wanted company he 'd be in the Nest . Best let it be . <p> We passed on , chilled , and strolled among the bungalows that served as living quarters . Gradually we got back to laying plans for the morning . The mood of the evening had changed , and I knew that an advance on my part would not be welcomed . <p> An hour later , we returned past the shore front . Bryan was still there . <p> Four characters had been written across the face of the flip chart . " It 's the god 's name , " said Murray . " It 's from the tablet with the pyramid . " <p> " What does the inscription say ? " asked Judy . <p> " ' In the god 's name are all things made possible . Speak , and he will reply . ' " There was of course no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or indeed how any of the Martian language had sounded . <p> " We have two kinds of inscriptions , " Murray explained . " One set advises visitors about behavior . No loud talking . No shouting or laughing . That sort of thing . The other 's devotional . ' Know that in the hour of most peril I am with you . ' " <p> Warren was puzzled . " So we have a society in a place where no one could have lived during the last three billion years or so . Some of the artifacts , drums , religious symbols , and whatnot , seem primitive . But they were able to put up solar power units . " It gave him a headache . " How long has this stuff been here ? Have we established that ? " He looked toward Sam . <p> Sam nodded . " The lab thinks the altar , the urns , the more primitive stuff , is about eleven thousand years old . The cable , the coils , the pyramid , one item that seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand years . " <p> " Older ? " said Eddie . <p> " Yes . The high-tech equipment came first . " Sam paused . " This is off the subject , but it 's something you should know . During the night , a lot happened back home . We have reports of widespread arrests across the United States . They 've got massive riots , and the rioters are on both sides of the issue . The National Guard was called out , and in some places they refused to fire on the rioters . Martin 's expected to declare a national emergency and there 's even talk of his suspending the Constitution . On top of all that , Broadwell says he 's not doing enough . " <p> " Broadwell ? " asked Judy . <p> " Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , " said Bryan . <p> They stared at one another . Warren thought about his kids , four of them , all in their twenties and trying to get started . He did n't like what he was hearing . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sam nodded . " We 're making provisions for anyone who wants to call home . Make a list of people you 're worried about and we 'll try to get through . But Harvey asked me to tell you that lines are jammed in some places and down in others so he ca n't promise anything . " <p> " Best thing for us , " said Jason , " is to just continue what we 're doing and let things play themselves out . There 's nothing we can do from here . " <p> Sam touched one earphone , the way he always did when a message was coming in . A moment later he nodded and punched a button to activate the speakers . <p> "  --  and gentlemen . " It was the Director . His voice , usually rich and full and authoritarian , sounded shaky . " I have to announce , " he said , " there 's been a coup . " <p> There was a rush of conversation and shushing . <p> " President Martin has stepped down . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill health . It 's no longer clear whether the Constitution remains in effect . The military has announced that Broadwell is taking over until they get things sorted out . Congress is reported to have approved the step . " <p> " A coup ? " said Jason . " In the United States ? " <p> " We 'll keep you informed as the situation warrants . " The Director seemed to be having trouble breathing . " Our only course is to recognize that we 're two hundred million miles away , and we should simply concentrate on doing our jobs . Thank you for your attention . " <p> " They ca n't do that , " stammered Murray . " They do n't have the authority . " <p> " Where 's the President ? " asked Judy . <p> Sam was still pressing his earphones . " The Tampa White House , apparently . Worldwide says he 's asking everybody to support Broadwell for the duration . " <p> Beyond the plasteel , the low red hills stretched to the horizon . Nobody said much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds , black and deep and empty , could twist reality , could spirit away the mundane and insinuate shadows and phantoms . This Broadwell , for example . Warren had never heard of him . An d now he was running the country ? <p> Judy shook it away , as if she too sensed that the sandscape invited illusion . She smiled at Warren , suggesting it would all be okay . <p> The pyramid and the pyramid tablet had been set side by side on a work table . She sat down in front of them . She looked first at the tablet , on which the crocodilian Martian lifted the glowing pyramid , its head bowed . And then at the pyramid itself , cool and remote . But something was different about the pyramid . <p> " Warren , " she said , " look at this . " <p> Warren looked . " It 's redder than it was . " <p> " It is , is n't it ? " Now that was unsettling . " O god of the pyramid , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to us . " <p> Later , Warren would recall with a smile that it was n't exactly a formulation to conjure up other-worldly powers . But the lights dimmed and the pyramid brightened . And a quivering singsong cacophony erupted inside the dome . <p> The voice , if indeed it was a voice , was pitched high . Warren glanced up at the speakers , but Sam shook his head . The sound was n't coming from them . <p> " The pyramid . " Judy almost fell out of her chair , getting away from it . The others circled the table , but kept a discreet distance . <p> " Why do n't we button up ? " suggested Abu Hassam . Abu 's background was medical  --  he was a physician  --  but his specialty was math . He 'd worked with Murray 's group on the translation . <p> Sam closed the shields , which shut off the sunlight , and turned off the lamps . Warren stared at the pyramid , stared into the pyramid . Deep in its interior , a ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ventilators were loud . <p> " Is someone there ? " asked Judy . <p> " Yes . " The voice sounded disembodied , spectral , inhuman . It chilled Warren . <p> " Who are you ? " asked Murray . <p> " I 've already told you my name . " <p> Warren glanced at Sam , who was shaking his head and muttering no no no . <p> Out in the hills , at the edge of vision , a buggy was crawling over the lip of a crater . <p> " You 're the god  --  " Her voice went off the top of the scale and she had to pull back and start again . " You 're the god of this place ? " <p> " I 'm the Administrator . " <p> " Where are you ? " asked Patti hesitantly . " Are you located inside the pyramid ? " <p> " The ' pyramid ' is a communication device . " Warren could hear the quotation marks . " You are from the third planet . " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you alive ? " <p> " Define the term . My grasp of your language is tenuous . I do n't even know its name . " <p> " English , " said Charlie Kepper , an archaeologist who had done most of his previous digging around North American Native mounds . <p> " Keep it simple , " said Jill . " Are you aware of your own existence ? " <p> It chuckled . " How would you reply ill asked you that question ? " <p> " Okay , " said Murray . " You said you 're the Administrator . What did you administrate ? " <p> " Mostly transportation among the five cities . I had other responsibilities as well . But nothing demanding . " <p> " What five cities ? There are no cities out there . " <p> " Well , of course you ca n't see them . How did you people manage to cross the void from the third world ? " <p> " The cities are buried , " said Eddie . <p> " Very good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right word ?  --  had possibilities . " <p> That stunned everybody . Patti broke the long silence that followed . " You 're familiar with Earth ? " <p> " The third world ? The People were familiar with it , and I through them . " <p> " The People ? " said Patti . " You mean the Martians ? " <p> " The People were not native to this world . " <p> Warren finally found his voice . " You 're talking about them in the past tense . Are they dead ? " <p> " Extinct , yes . Dead . " <p> " How long ago ? " asked Jill . <p> " This world has completed its orbit six thousand seventeen times since the last of them died . But they forgot who they were long before that . " <p> " And who were they ? " <p> " A race of great accomplishment and much promise . But the very qualities that drove their energies betrayed them . " <p> " In what way ? " <p> " They questioned everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to uncover the deepest secrets of the cosmos , they were also unable to achieve long-term political stability . Those who came here were refugees . " <p> " Where did they come from ? " <p> " I am unable to think how I might show you . Let me say only that , if their home star were a hundred times closer , it would still not be visible , I suspect , to your unaided eyes . " <p> " And they came to Mars . " Murray looked out at the sterile landscape . " Why not Earth ? " <p> " It was too crowded with predators . And life . The gravity index was too high . Practical matters aside , they considered this world more beautiful . " <p> " Why did they die off ? " asked Bryan Trahan , who had been observing quietly . " What happened to them ? " <p> " After we had settled , after a period of great achievement , they began again to disagree . Sometimes on form of government . Sometimes on the ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary works . Their quarrels splintered them into smaller and more hostile fragments . We could have removed the part of them that resisted socialization . Could have tamed it . But that issue itself became divisive . They loved combat . <p> " Eventually they became subject to their own technology , lost the knowledge without which reason is only of limited use . And they retreated into their own barbaric past . " <p> Jason picked up one of the tablets . <p> " Yes . That is exactly right . They forgot who I was . Who they were . They converted the surface villas , which were designed to allow appreciation of the vistas of this world , into places of worship . " <p> " And you , " said Bryan , " became the resident deity . " <p> It laughed . The sound was bone-chilling . " Yes . Toward the end , they were killing one another to curry my favor . " <p> " Why did n't you stop them ? " asked Judy , her voice cold . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . " <p> " My God , " said Warren . " It sounds like one of the laws of robotics . " <p> " What ? " asked Bryan . <p> Warren was surprised that anyone in that group would not have heard of the three laws of robotics . " A robot must obey a human , " he said . <p> " I am not a robot . " <p> Patti stared at the pyramid . <p> " And they did this while you watched ? " asked Murray . <p> There was no answer . As the silence stretched out , they glanced uncomfortably at each other . <p> " Do you have a moral sense ? " asked Eddie . <p> " That 's an impertinent question , Edwards . " <p> " You know who I am . " <p> " I know who all of you are . " <p> " You , " said Bryan , " are able to tell us their whole history . Right ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Not only here , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all that in my memory , but I can make it available . " <p> " How ? " <p> " It is stored in the ships . " <p> Murray 's face clouded . " The ships , " he said . " The vehicles they used to cross the stars . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What kind of vehicles ? " asked Eddie . " How fast were they ? " <p> " They traveled at multiples of light speed . " <p> " My God , " said Judy . " You can give us FTL . " <p> " There is little that the People did not understand about the mechanics of the universe . That which is allowed , they were capable of performing . I suspect you do not have antigravity ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Temporal manipulation ? " <p> " Probably not . " <p> " Quantum power ? " <p> " Not to speak of . But you can make all this available to us ? " <p> " If you wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control the capabilities I can provide . " <p> " Where are the ships ? " asked Abu . <p> " In the asteroid belt . I will give you their location if you will do something for me . " <p> " I thought , " said Judy , " there 'd be something . " <p> Murray looked puzzled . " What could you possibly want from us ? " <p> " I 've been here a long time . I want you to disengage my circuits . Give me peace . " <p> " You mean kill you ? " asked Patti , shocked . <p> " I mean terminate my existence . " <p> " We ca n't do that , " said Bryan . " We ca n't kill a sentient creature . " <p> " I 'm a machine . " <p> Abu shook his head . " You said you were n't a robot . " <p> " It is my request . You have an obligation to honor it . " <p> " We 're not bound to honor someone else 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a chair . " Listen , I understand you 've been alone for centuries . But you 'll never be alone again . Someone will always be here . " He looked up at Murray . " Wo n't we , Murray ? " <p> " I do n't think you understand . I do n't wish to give offense , but you 're not appropriate companions for me . There 's hope for you , but you still lack the subtlety of an advanced intellect . " <p> Eddie sighed . " Advanced intellect ? You used to run subways . " <p> " Good . I 'm pleased to see you have a sense of humor . If the behavior exhibited on the reports coming in from your home world is typical , I can understand why . " <p> IT WAS TIME TO BREAK OFF . " We 'll deal with it tomorrow , " I told them . " We 'll discuss the issue in the morning , and when we know what we want to do , we 'll recall the Administrator and give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended for the day , the Baranovians were expected to get away from it . They were supposed to go boating or play shuffleboard or just sit around in The Hawk 's Nest . But Sam explained to me that these people took the game very seriously . I 'd already seen some evidence of that tendency when Murray 's team stayed up wrestling with the translations . On this third night , they could be found in groups all over Skyhawk , in conference rooms , along the benches , out on the terrace behind the dining room , debating the choice that had been laid before them . <p> Could they comply with the wish of a sentient being and , in effect , kill it ? After all , Patti argued to a small group outside the boathouse , there 's nothing physically wrong with it . It 's only depressed . Killing it would be murder . <p> Warren Hatch and Eddie Edwards almost came to blows . Warren also thought it would be murder . But Eddie explained that he 'd kept a cancer-ridden sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes grew wet . " Never again , " he said . " If this thing wants to be terminated , then I think we should comply . " <p> Warren shook his head . " Even if you have to violate your own moral code to do so ? " <p> Maureen and I felt so good about what we were seeing that we left the grounds and went downtown to celebrate . There was a small college town nearby with a hotel featuring a sidewalk restaurant . The evening was pleasant , there were no insects , and the moonlight was serene . We started with BLT 's , and finished with gin tonics . " I think we can relax now , " she said . " The program 's going to be fine . " <p> We 'd both been worried . Neither of us had participated in anything like this previously , and we had n't been sure what to expect . Sam had warned us how last year the Baranovians had solved the Moonbase murder mystery too quickly and simply taken the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Martian scenario to ensure that did n't happen again . But you never knew . <p> " Thanks , " I said . <p> She squeezed my hand . " What interests me is that they 've got so involved in the ethical dilemma that they have n't yet seen the political implications . " <p> Each evening , I 'd prepared the set of bulletins that would come in the following day from Worldwide News and Mars Central . I 'd written a complete set before coming , but quickly discovered it was impossible to predict what the program would need . Although I could keep the flow of action within parameters , I could not determine in advance what might need to be emphasized here , or redefined there . For example , Maureen was right : the Baranovians needed to think about the world beyond their dome . And we were going to see to that first thing tomorrow . <p> And in case you 're wondering , no , I did n't score . Not then and not later . I think she liked my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things are going downhill , " he said . He pushed a button . Explosions and gun shots rattled out of the speakers . And screams . <p> "  --  Show no sign of backing off , Howard . " Warren recognized the speaker as Christine Talley , a correspondent for Worldwide . " I can see three , possibly four , people down in the street . All civilians . The soldiers now are trying to go house to house . But there are snipers in the upper apartments . We 're getting reports that it 's like this all over Atlanta . " They could hear the sound of an approaching helicopter . " We 're still hearing rumors of summary executions . But the Army wo n't comment . " She was shouting now to be heard over the roar of the aircraft . " Okay , you can see what 's happening , Howard . The gunships are positioning themselves directly over the houses where most of the shooting has been coming from . The troops are keeping their distance . " ( Long pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another voice : " You 'll have to leave , ma'am . For your own safety . " <p> After that , everything dissolved into confusion : shouts , protests , the sounds of a brief scuffle . Then Howard Kilminster from the Worldwide desk : " We 've encountered technical difficulties for the moment with Christine Talley in Atlanta . We 'll get back to her as soon as we 're able . Meanwhile , the Pentagon has confirmed that two Regimental Combat Teams in the Chicago area have fired on other U.S. troops  --  " <p> Somebody said , " Turn it off . " Sam complied and the room got very quiet . <p> " Not sure what we 're going to have to go home to , " said Judy . <p> Warren wondered about his two kids living with his first wife in Philadelphia , and about his sister in Ardmore . Were they in danger ? What was really happening ? <p> Murray Fine berg had been standing staring out at the bleak red sky . " Something we need to think about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into possession of some very high-level technology . " <p> Warren understood immediately where that was going . <p> " Do we really want to turn quantum power , whatever that is , over to a military dictatorship ? " asked Abu . <p> " It 's not a military dictatorship , " said Jason hotly . <p> " I think , " said Warren , " it would be prudent to assume the worst . " <p> Al Finley , a newspaper editor from Toronto , suggested they divide into two teams to address each of the issues they now faced : Do they terminate the Administrator ? Do they accept the advanced technology , knowing it will end up in the hands of the government ? <p> But everyone had things to say on both topics , so they stayed together . And it became apparent that no one had settled anything the previous evening . On the issue of euthanasia , several had gone through personal experiences with dying relatives and friends that they had no intention of repeating . Honor its wishes , they said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral equivalent of murder . " Maybe worse , " said Patti Kubik . " If this thing really is a higher life form than we are , as it would like us to believe , then killing it is that much more reprehensible . I wo n't have anything to do with it . And I 'm not sure I 'll allow anyone else to shut it down . " <p> They ended in deadlock . The debate over accepting high-tech capabilities went easier . All had reservations , but almost everyone thought the risk was worth it . " We get starships , " said Judy Conroy . " How can we walk away from that ? " <p> Only Al Finley held out . " You get starships . And you also get 1984 . It 's the prime directive in reverse . Technology without a corresponding social maturity is potentially deadly . I do n't think we should touch it . Tell the Administrator to get on the radio , if it can , and send the ships to Alpha Centauri . Maybe by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff . " <p> But no one supported him . <p> They voted on the euthanasia issue , and decided by a majority of one to comply with the Administrator 's wishes . The losing side wanted to reopen the discussion , but lake Cobblemere intervened . " It 's over , " he said . " We terminate . " <p> That produced some grumbling and three people walked out in protest , announcing their intention to return to Central rather than participate in murder . Warren was tempted to join them , but he 'd listened to the arguments and was no longer sure in his own mind what was right . <p> The pyramid rested serenely on the worktable . <p> " Administrator , " said Judy . <p> " I 've been listening . " <p> " Then you know what we 've decided . " <p> " I know . " <p> " You will have to explain what we need to do to shut off your power . " <p> " That will not be necessary . " <p> " Why ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ability to maintain my own systems . The darkness is very close . I would , in fact , have allowed myself to pass out of existence almost a century ago , your time . Except that I detected radio signals . I knew you were coming . " <p> " And you held on ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Why did you lie ? About wanting us to terminate you ? " <p> " The technology of the People lies waiting to be claimed . But it is hard to judge the morality of a species by its radio broadcasts . I know you share their unfortunate tendencies toward political disunion . But I needed a better method to grasp your moral inclinations before I turned this over to you . I wanted to look you in the eye , so to speak . " <p> " And you will give us the ships ? " asked Judy . They held their breath . <p> " Yes , " be said . " I will give you the ships . " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote to commit murder , and you give us credit for a moral code . I have to tell you I have some doubts about yours . " <p> " Patti , " it said , " I did not mean to imply that your course of action was the correct one . I was only concerned that you not find the decision an easy one to make . " <p> " It 's a copout , " said Bryan . " These plots that build up to a conclusion in which we discover it 's a test of some sort are really weak . But that 's not the point . " <p> We were in the dining hall . I 'd finished off a pretty good meat-loaf with mashed potatoes , corn and muffins , and I 'd gone heavy on the butter , which is a delicacy I seldom allow myself anymore . But I was feeling good because the program had gone well , or at least I 'd thought it had until Bryan came after me . <p> " What is the point ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did every evening , and the entire twenty-odd Baranovians , who a moment before had been planning the festivities for this final evening , gave us their undivided attention . <p> " The AI says that the conclusion is n't important . That the only thing that matters is that we had to struggle to come to it . But what kind of response is that ? We still do n't know what , given the circumstances , the appropriate course of action is . And neither do you , or you 'd have had an answer . " <p> I 'd played the AI , of course . And Bryan was right : I had no more clue about the eternal verities than anybody else did . How was I supposed to say what was right and what wrong ? " It might be , " I said , " that some situations are so morally hazy that no clear-cut course of action can be found . This situation , for example , seems to be a case of choosing the lesser evil . " <p> " But which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Bryan , I 'm not able to answer that for other people . I think we need to keep a little perspective about all this . Maybe even indulge our sense of humor . You do have one , right ? I mean , this thing does have its comic aspect . " <p> Tears stood in his eyes . " Damn you , Jake , " he said . He said it low , but he 'd already drawn the attention of everybody at all three tables . He looked around at the others , heaved a loud discouraged sigh , and walked out into the failing sunlight . I watched him stride down the concrete walkway and turn left toward the bungalows . The path curves into the trees and disappears behind a conference hall . He never looked back . <p> " What was that all about ? " asked Sam . <p> " I do n't know , " said Maureen . She looked puzzled . <p> " You okay ? " I said . <p> " You notice his eyes ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I do n't know . Different . " <p> " How different ? " <p> " The man has secrets , " she said . <p> The Baranovians did reconvene later that evening , but somehow their festivities were n't as festive as I 'd expected . Bryan was n't there , in body , but I felt his presence just over my shoulder and had no idea what to do about it . Though nobody said a word , I think everyone else felt it , too , mentally replaying his last scene and trying to figure out what to make of it . <p> So we went through the motions , voting on a topic for next year 's seminar and then adjourning to the lakeshore for a spirited enactment of the Martian ceremonies depicted on our tablets . The centerpiece was a roaring bonfire around which bizarrely costumed Baranovians feasted on " sacred marshmallows " and sacrificed a stuffed Barney . The script was even sillier than it sounds , and it could have made for a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least mine was n't . <p> I found myself drifting off to where Maureen stood in the shadows , staring pensively into the flames . " You thinking about him , too ? " I asked . <p> " Of course , " she said . " Looking back , there were a lot of little things .... " She turned toward Sam , who was just a few feet away . " Sam , how long has Bryan been coming to the seminars ? " <p> " I think this was his second , " he said . " Yes . You 've noticed how quiet he is  --  " <p> " Except when he 's coming after me , " I said . <p> " Well , yes . I guess so . But on the whole he does n't say much . He was so quiet last year I remember wondering why he 'd bothered to come . Then the last day  --  at this point in the proceedings  --  he finally started talking . " <p> " About what ? " asked Maureen . <p> Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over what we would do this year . I think he was the one who suggested the archaeology on Mars scenario . " <p> " You think ? " <p> " I 'm sure , " he said . " He suggested it , and he pushed hard for it . Got his way , as it turned out . " <p> Something nagged me about that . Quiet stranger shows up , takes little part in the current game but campaigns hard for a specific scenario for next time . Gets his wish  --  and ends up in a funk when it does n't reach the resolution he 'd hoped for . <p> What resolution had he wanted ? <p> " Should we try to find him ? " I asked Sam . " See if there 's anything we can do ? " <p> Sam thought awhile before he answered . " No . No , I do n't think so . He 's a big boy , Jake . " He smiled at the joke . <p> But he did n't sound very sure . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone well and I should have felt proud and contented . <p> Next morning everyone said their goodbyes at breakfast  --  everyone except Bryan , who was n't there . Nobody , including the desk clerk , had seen him leave  --  but his account was paid . I asked to see his room and found it made up , even though the maids had n't started their morning rounds . Had he done it himself ? <p> * * * Questions unanswered , I tossed two small bags into the back of my Honda , checked out , and started the long , lonely drive home to Indianapolis . It was a good day for it , a huge dome of high pressure keeping the scenery crisp and the driving easy most of the way , though I did run into a couple of late afternoon thunderstorms . <p> I could have made the whole trip in one day , but that would have been too long and grueling for my tastes . I had a vague idea about stopping somewhere around Toledo for the night , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . With lots of solo time on my hands , I " read " half a book on the car 's tape player . <p> Eventually , saturation set in and I switched it off as I pulled into a rest area somewhere on the Ohio Turnpike . Something must have been gradually gnawing its way up out of my subconscious , because when I returned to the car after a visit to the facilities and a stroll around the grounds , I found myself reaching for the trunk key instead of the ignition . I watched curiously as my hand opened one of my bags and pulled out the list Sam had passed out last night with the names and addresses of all the Baranovians . <p> Bryan 's address , as my subconscious must have already noted , was an apartment somewhere in northwestern Ohio . I did n't recognize the name of the town , but a check of the map showed that it was n't that far out of my way . <p> Two exits later , I left the Turnpike , threading my way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lattice of arrow-straight roads . <p> It was almost dark when I got there  --  late enough that common sense said I should nail down a room before I did anything else . But then , common sense would n't have advised this detour in the first place . So I went directly to Bryan 's address , near the edge of a sleepy little college town . <p> His apartment was the attic of an old house on a quiet , tree-lined street still slick from the afternoon 's showers . The whole house was dark , except that I thought I could see a faint flickering light through a dormer window near the back upstairs . I sat in the car for a few minutes , thinking . Then I walked across the street and up Bryan 's outside stairway . <p> Paint was peeling from the door . I knocked . <p> No answer . I knocked again . " Bryan ? " I called softly , not wishing to attract attention from neighbors . <p> Still no answer . There was no glass in the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep stairs to see in the window  --  but there was definitely light in there , flickering and changing color . <p> I knocked still again and began trying to think up a story to get the landlord to let me in . Hell , how would I even find out who the landlord was ? <p> Did I have time to waste trying ? I had no concrete reason to believe Bryan was in danger , but the way he 'd been acting , who could tell what was going on ? And I felt vaguely responsible . It was clear that , if it was possible to bring suit against science fiction writers for malpractice , he would have come after me . <p> I fell back on the obvious and got lucky . The door was unlocked . <p> Carelessness ? Or did he want me  --  or somebody  --  to find it that way ? <p> THE ROOM TASTED WEIRD . I know how that sounds , but I stood in the dark and felt the hair on my scalp rise . The flickering I 'd seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with a screen saver like none I 'd ever seen . It made me think of those pictures of the star nursery that the Hubble sent back a couple of years ago , but animated , suggesting the way those colorful gas clouds might look if you were flying through them . I felt oddly light , as if gravity were less in here than outside . It might have been a hypnotic effect induced by the screen saver . At least , that 's what I thought . What I told myself . <p> I switched on the room light , a bare bulb in the ceiling , but the giddy sensation did n't go away . I looked around . <p> The room looked abandoned . A narrow bed stood unmade in one corner . I saw no other furniture except a rickety chair in front of the computer  --  which , with the lights on , was a perfectly ordinary Macintosh . I wondered why it had been left on . <p> The room whispered clearly that its occupant had left in a hurry and was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dusted all that often , and he had n't cleaned up after he removed the few things he 'd taken with him . A couple of clean rectangles on the floor , with rows of dust bunnies along the baseboard behind them , said there had been other furnishings , but precious few beyond what remained . <p> One other item caught my eye and drew it irresistibly : a picture on the far wall . It was hardly surprising that a Baranovian would decorate with science fiction art , but even from here , this was one of the most realistic portraits of an unearthly landscape I had ever seen . Three crystal towers of varying heights and slightly different aspect rose against a background of pink and blue mountains . The towers gleamed in double sunlight . In the foreground , a broad river rolled through a purple forest . Something I could n't quite make out soared above the water on giant butterfly wings . <p> It was , I thought , one of those computerized productions that are virtually indistinguishable from photography  --  or , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked utterly three-dimensional , and when I put my face close to the glass I could see way out to the sides . <p> I shivered . Who are you , Bryan ? <p> A photo and a computer . <p> Not a photo , I reminded myself . <p> I sat down at the computer , clicked the mouse , and the screen saver dissolved to several rows of curious symbols . It was no script I knew , and I can recognize a lot of scripts even if I ca n't read them . <p> I tried changing it to every font in the menu , but all I got was gibberish . I went through the other menus , and among the desk accessories I found two unfamiliar icons with labels that looked like that same script . I tried one of them and got nothing . But the other ... <p> The screen melted into a greeting : <p> HELLO JAKE The chair was on rollers and I backed away a foot or so , and almost fell off . <p> YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IT IS BOTH YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR WEAKNESS . <p> What the hell was he talking about ? Did he mean me ? <p> I could see into the kitchen , where two pots had been left atop a battered range . Somewhere outside , a garage door banged down . <p> GOOD INTENTIONS DO N'T COUNT FOR MUCH , JAKE . SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT . <p> I 'D HOPED FOR A SOLUTION . INSTEAD , I SUSPECT YOU 'VE INHERITED A PROBLEM . <p> I stared at it , trying to understand . What problem had I inherited ? What were we talking about ? <p> SORRY . <p> It ended there . <p> Heart hammering , I went through all the right motions , saving the document , printing a copy , and exiting from word processing . When the menu appeared onscreen , I turned off the room lights and went to stand by the window , looking out . The sky had cleared behind the storms and there were few street lights . <p> My first thought was : it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd prefer . It 's the answer I could sleep with . But I know it 's not so . I knew it was n't so the moment I shut down the Macintosh , and felt my weight flow back . <p> It did n't take me long to figure out what kind of problem he 'd handed me . I guess he 'd intended it as a gift . Or maybe it was just to prove he had a sense of humor . I disconnected the computer , carried it outside and put it in my trunk . <p> Poor Bryan . <p> I wish him well , wherever he is and whatever he might choose to do . I know so little about just what kind of fix he was in or what kind of pressure he was under . I do n't know how directly the Seminar applied to it . But I do know that , for him , it was n't just a game  --  and that he was looking to us for help we could n't quite give him . <p> I 'm more conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to be . While I 'm writing this , it 's visible through my window , over Kegan 's tool shed . <p> We 've got an easier way to get there now . It 's out in my garage , covered by a tarp . But I wonder what a truly three-dimensional society , utterly released from the demands of gravity and friction , might be like . <p> Bryan 's right . I ca n't analyze what changes it might bring . But I can sure feel them . <p> The authors are grateful to the organizers of and participants in The Asimov Seminar for accepting us as their own , and for inspiring this story .
