Calling 911 wo n't quite cut it when you 're out fishing . If you or your tackle need first aid , be prepared . I had done it hundreds of times , but this time everything went wrong . My grip over the pike 's gills slipped , and the fish and I were instantly attached . Two points of the plug 's treble hook protruded from the fish 's jaw . The third point was buried far past the barb into muscle below the joint attaching the index finger to my left hand . I was alone , a strong wind and rough water were heading my boat toward a reef , and the fish had no intention of keeping still . The Auto Pilot feature on my Minn Kota , electric was a saving factor . Using the foot control , I set a course away from the rocks , letting the motor take me into safe water . Keeping the pike under control with my right hand , I managed to manipulate the good wire cutters on my pliers with the left hand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free the two points that were through the pike 's jaw . Things were looking better . Now I needed to work the old loop trick to get the barb from my hand . I needed a piece of heavy monofilament , cord or wire . Unfortunately , none was handy  --  it was time to improvise . Looking around , I noticed that the shower-curtain ring that held my hand towel to the console was in fact a loop . I slipped the hook bend around that , lined things up , yanked and listened to an audible pop as the barb came free . I sat there a bit , remembering a long time back when I 'd worked this same trick on the multiple hooks of an old Helin Fish Cake surface plug that had attached a 10-pound brown trout to the thumb of my friend Spence Logue . He still calls me Doc . Just in case you do n't know the technique , it 's easy . Once free of the lure , the eye of the offending hook is pushed against the flesh and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong line , a shoelace or other material , is looped across the inside hook bend . It 's this material that will be yanked to pop free the hook . The barb will come out without tearing tissue , but you must yank quickly . Do n't try this where eyes are involved . See your doctor within 72 hours for a tetanus booster . No one can field every oddball first aid and tackle emergency that may occur on a fishing trip , but you can equip yourself to handle most of them . You 're more important than your tackle , so lets look at bodily safety first . Guarding against a hook in your hide is better than trying to pluck one out . Hats and glasses are obvious protection . In dim light I swap my sunglasses for clear shooting glasses , which have saved my eyes several times . If you 're faced with someone making wild sidearm casts across the boat , crowd right up behind the person . That 's the safest place to be , and the caster will quickly get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazards from fish species for which you 're angling . Teeth , fin spines and gill plates are obvious . On trips for new species , learn about the fish from local experts . Not so obvious are strange hazards such as this : If bass fishing is really hot and you lip enough fish over the day , your thumb can end up looking like it has been sanded down a few layers of skin . A nasty infection can follow unless the abrasion is well-cleaned with antiseptic and rested . Avoid the problem with a thumb guard . Baitcasting reels that have levelwind mechanisms that move from side to side when line is going out can grab a pinch of your palm or thumb and hold it there most painfully . The free-spool buttons of the offending reel models can not be activated as long as there 's outgoing pressure on the line . Check to see how the levelwind mechanisms on your baitcasters react so that you know to extricate yourself . With big , strong fish such as salmon , steelhead and especially saltwater species , jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur when line loops get under watches and , even worse , rings . I like to remove all jewelry when fishing for these species . In very hot weather dehydration can get ahead of you before you know it . It can make you dizzy and impair your judgment . Never get behind in liquid intake ; it can cause an imbalance of minerals ( potassium and sodium ) in your blood . Drink water , juices or sport drinks , even if you do n't feel thirsty , and snack on high potassium foods such as bananas . I like to wet a hat occasionally or place a small piece of wet towel in its crown . The evaporation cools my head . I bring a first aid kit wherever I travel . It contains cling-type gauze , Band-Aids , butterfly bandages , tape , alcohol prep pads , headache remedy , insect-sting-ease sticks , antibacterial ointment , anti-diarrhea medicine and antibiotics . Your doctor will need to prescribe some of these for you . Just tell him that medical care is not reliable or at hand where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large wounds only if necessary , and I have taken training in their use . I also recommend taking a CPR/emergency first aid course . Tackle breakdowns can ruin a day locally and break your heart on long-distance trips . Few anglers today go anywhere without one ( maybe many ) spare rod/reel outfit(s) , but it makes sense to be able to make field repairs . I carry spare internal parts kits that come with specific reels . In general , the weak spot of older spinning reels is the bail spring , though line snubbers often cause problems with spincasting reels . Levelwind pawls wear out when least expected . These are all easy to fix , if you have the parts and tools . The Achilles ' heel of a rod is its fragile tip . I often carry a variety of tiptop sizes and rod wrap thread . If a rod tip breaks an inch or so from the top , you can trim the break evenly and slip on a new tiptop . If a spare tiptop is a little too big , build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cement and slip on the tiptop . The rod action will be changed , but you 'll get by . Even easier , Mildrum Manufacturing Company makes an Emergency Rod Top kit . The emergency tiptop is held in place with a stabilizer spring and a piece of heat-shrink tubing . The unit is reusable . In a bind , tiptops can serve as rod guides , but I like to carry a few extra guides . These can be temporarily wrapped on with monofilament line . Learn how to do a simple rod guide wrap and bring a widget or single-edge razor blade for cutting off old wraps . My emergency field repair kit has saved more than one trip , and one can save yours . I carry wire cutters , pliers ( the two can be combined ) , flashlight , reel parts ( specific to your models ) , reel grease and oil and neat's-foot oil , reel wrenches , small jeweler 's screwdrivers , multi-tool knife , a short length of strong line or parachute cord , razor blade , tiptop repair kit , drag washers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose glasses frames , spare sunglasses frame screws , flat rubber grippers ( like those used to take off jar lids  --  for separating jammed ferrules ) , Chap Stick to lubricate ferrules , rod wrap thread , epoxy glue , strong quick-bond adhesive , a tube of Goop and a roll each of duct and black plastic tape . All but the duct tape fits in an 8 X 5-inch waterproof box . Most of these materials are readily available in tackle shops or from mail-order firms . The tape will come in handy more often than you know . I once saved a day of expensive offshore fishing by taping a leaking fuel hose . As for Goop , you can use it to repair rod grips  --  both cork and foam  --  hold on tiptops and guides and 101 other things on a boat . It 'll hold on a transducer . Instead of drilling holes for sonar or other electronics brackets , Goop them on . There 's a more flexible version called Shoe Goo that 'll repair your fishing shoes , and the UV6800 version holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two products that will keep your reels  --  as well as electricmotor parts and electronics  --  working and quiet in the most extreme marine environment . They are Boeshield T9 and Corrosion Block . You 'll use the stuff at home , too , wherever metal is exposed to weather . With you and your equipment so well cared for , all you now need is to catch the fish . <p>
