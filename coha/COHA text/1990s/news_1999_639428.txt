<p> Joe Sakic remembers his first NHL point like it was well 11 years ago . ' I passed it to Anton Stastny , he went down the left side and scored 5-hole ( between the goalie 's legs ) . It was at Hartford in the ' Mall ' and I think it was on Mike Liut , ' Sakic said of his Oct 6. , 1988 , assist , his first career point when he was a Quebec Nordique . ' You might want to check your record book but I think it was against him . ' <p> Judges ? If this were Jeopardy and Alex Trebek announced a categort for ' The Life and Times of Joe Sakic , ' Sakic would n't even get questions about his career right . <p> The goalie against whom Sakic recorded his first NHL point was actually Sean Burke . Sakic also scored his first goal later in that game , also on Burke , so you 'd think the Colorado Avalanche captain would remember who was really in net that night for the Whalers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who returned to action for the Avs on Monday night in a quest for his 1,000th career point , which he earned assisting on a Chris Dingman goal in the second period . <p> As the Burnaby , British Columbia , native closed in on P1K , on the doorstep of Y2K , his failure to recall some of the details to his individual achievements best illustrates how be has never much cared about them , or the spotlight they 've brought him . <p> Sakic does n't like the bright glare of attention focused on just him . He prefers anonymity for the most part . Sure , being a big NHL star is what he always wanted growing up . But being a big NHL star off the ice is a necessary evil . Not that he 's mad about having to sign autographs or do lots of press - Sakic is always gracious with fans and reporters - but that has always been the part of his job that has seemed just that . <p> ' I enjoy my low profile in Denver , ' Sakic said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll go out once in awhile after a game , but not too much . ' <p> Sakic maintains his affectionate nickname of ' Quoteless Joe ' with the press , but he usually is the player reporters go to first when they want the cold , hard facts of how his team played that night . If the Avs were awful , Sakic says so . If they were great , he says that , too . The thing is , whether the Avs were terrible or wonderful , Sakic always says the words in the same plain , low-key way . That seems to be Sakic 's unspoken motto , a by-product of having played on some of the best , and worst , teams of the last decade in the NHL . <p> ' Those first couple years with Quebec , we were slugs , ' said Sakic , whose team went 12-61-7 his second season in the league . ' We were terrible . ' <p> It was during that second season with Quebec , however , that Sakic established himself as a future star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of their careers - Michel Goulet , Guy Lafleur , Peter Stastny - Sakic led the team with 29 goals and 102 points in 80 games in 1989-90 . That 's the year he thought he would have a long future in the NHL , although 1,000 points seemed unthinkable . <p> ' I did n't look back then at getting 1,000 or anything , ' he said . ' Any milestone that you get closer to , though , you start thinking about it a little . But when you start out , you 're not looking at what numbers you 're going to get in your career . Back in Quebec in the early years , you 'd talk to the coaches and they 'd say , ' Just go . Just play offense , and go get goals . ' I was like , ' Oh . OK . ' ' <p> The points kept adding up for Sakic in the next two seasons ( 109 and 94 , respectively ) , but the victories did n't for the Nordiques . In his first four years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ' Losing night after night was awful , ' he said . ' But then we started getting some good young players in the draft , and then the ( Eric ) Lindros trade got us a lot in return . ' <p> Just when the Nordiques looked like they might give Quebec a Stanley Cup , financial problems forced the team to move to Denver in the summer of 1995 . Sakic did n't know the city of Denver from John Denver back then . One word came to mind when visualizing what his new city might be like : snow . <p> ' We definitely did n't think the weather would be as good as it is , ' he said . ' We thought it would be like Quebec . But the weather in Denver is a secret , how good it is . ' <p> As Avs fans know , Sakic 's first season in Denver was magical for him and the team . He acheived career highs in goals ( 51 ) and assists ( 69 ) , and then came the playoffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NHL playoff record ) and won the Conn Smythe Trophy in leading the Avs to the Cup . His six game-winning goals in the playoffs still are tied for the NHL record . <p> The following year saw a landmark , three-year , $ 21 million contract for Sakic , which was then the highest in the NHL . Some wondered whether big money would change Sakic . It did n't , close friends say . <p> ' I do n't think so . He does what he does best , which is work hard and try to maintain what he 's done . I think hockey is his life , ' said teammate Adam Foote , who has played with Sakic since 1991-92 . ' He 's dedicated to the game , and he 's got a good work ethic . Out of anyone on this team , hockey is what be likes to do and he works real hard at it . ' <p> Said former longtime teammate Craig Wolanin , ' He 's always been the same guy . Hard-working , team oriented . He likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best teammates I ever had . ' <p> Now that he 's healthy , Sakic can finally pursue his passion again . Injuries have started to take a bit of a toll on him the last few years , but Sakic says he is not starting to feel old . <p> ' I do n't think I 'm feeling old . but I 'm getting there , ' he said . ' It 's 12 years , so I 've been around awhile . I 'm not a young up-and-comer anymore . ' <p> How many more years does Sakic expect to be in the league then ? The answer , after this season , is four . <p> ' That would be , what , 16 ? That would be good , I think , ' Sakic said . ' Once I really start going downhill , I wo n't want to play anymore . But to keep playing , keep playing well and contribute - I think I can still do that . But yeah , I 'm looking at another four after this year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avalanche before this season is over , however . That 's because , under the NHL 's collective bargaining agreement , he wo n't have the right to get a no-trade clause until the season is up . Sakic ca n't become an unrestricted free agent until after next season , so he 'd rather sign one more long-term contract instead of a one-year deal next summer . Sakic told The Post last season he wants to finish his career with the Avalanche , but with the team 's shaky ownership situation , nothing is guaranteed . <p> ' I 'm going to wait until after the year anyway , so as long as we have an owner by then , it does n't worry me , ' Sakic said . ' But I 'm at the age now where I just want to be in one place and not have to worry about anything .
