<p> FORT COLLINS - It 's enough to make anyone itch . <p> Inside a small room in a big brick building in a well-landscaped office park , buckets of stagnant water teem with mosquitos . In another room , employees of Paravax raise 12 million fleas a year inside warm plexiglass boxes dubbed " artificial dogs . " <p> It 's all in the name of research to make real dogs , cats and their owners safer , healthier and a little more comfortable . <p> Paravax , the nation 's only independent veterinary biotech company , uses the mosquitos and fleas in developing vaccines to fight flea infestations , flea allergies , heartworm and a variety of other parasite-induced irritations and ailments that plague companion pets and their owners . <p> Company officials estimate the market for the flea vaccine alone at around $ 200 million annually , just in the United States . Adding some credence to that estimate is the huge demand for a monthly flea pill recently marketed by Swiss pharmaceutical giant Ciba-Geigy Ltd . <p> " It 's a new frontier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive of Paravax . " There have been viral and bacterial vaccines around for a while , but developing parasite vaccines is much more difficult . They 're a more evolved organism . " <p> Much of what Paravax 's 60 or so employees do now involves taking those organisms apart . They dissect the bugs to remove miniscule flea ovaries or salivary glands or mosquito intestines in the hopes of identifying the proteins that govern digestion or reproduction . From those proteins , Paravax scientists figure they can clone the compounds that can halt reproduction or digestion to create a genetically engineered vaccine that will kill the parasite . <p> The company is developing a wide range of products from vaccines to diagnostic tools , including : <p> The world 's first vaccine for Toxoplasma gondii , a flu-like disease transmitted by cat feces that can produce birth defects when pregnant women become infected . <p> A product to reduce the transmission of Bartonella henselae , or Cat Scratch Fever , a generally nonfatal infection from cat scratches . It can be life threatening to people with weakened immune systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies in pets . <p> An annual vaccine to prevent heartworm . <p> The company is farthest along in the Tocolasma gondii vaccine and already developing a second-generation product . Paravax has licensed the vaccine to industrial and pharmaceutical giant Bayer A.G. , which plans to market the product next year . <p> The vaccine is for the cat , not the woman , and prevents the animal from shedding the organism , so that even if a cat is infected , the disease can not be transmitted to humans . <p> In the Cat Scratch Fever research , two Paravax employees are working full time with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to develop a vaccine . The disease is transmitted through the scratches of young cats , usually those that have been outdoors . Symptoms of the virus include swollen lymph nodes , high fever , loss of appetite and weakness that may appear weeks after the scratch and , in healthy people , disappear on their own . According to the CDC , more people are diagnosed or hospitalized each year with cases of Cat Scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Much of Paravax 's work right now focuses on developing vaccines for fleas , flea allergies and heartworm in dogs and cats . <p> What Paravax officials envision is annual injections , like those for rabies and other pet diseases , that would eliminate fleas and the threat of heartworm . <p> Heartworm has become a growing problem in Colorado and is at near-epidemic proportions in wetter areas of the country . It is transmitted from one infected animal to another by mosquitos . It 's primarily a dog disease , but can infect cats as well . <p> For the flea vaccine , the company 's scientists have identified a number of molecules that could hold the secret to controlling the biting , blood-sucking bug . <p> The concept is to shut down the flea 's body functions . If scientists can identify and reproduce key antibodies , they can inject it into a cat or dog as a vaccine . Then , when the flea bites into the animal , the flea ingests those antibodies in the blood . The antibodies in turn latch onto proteins in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability . <p> Hand-in-hand with the simple flea problem is flea allergy dermatitis , a debilitating reaction to the fleas that leaves animals scratching themselves raw . The common ailment now is treated only with steroids . <p> Paravax scientists think the allergy problem is in a protein in the flea 's saliva . They 've identified the protein and developed a vaccine that 's currently being tested . <p> For its heartworm program , Paravax is in the second stage of clinical tests of its vaccines . The worms are almost always fatal in cats and frequently fatal in dogs . There are no current treatments for cats . For dogs , the preventative treatment available today consists of chewable tablets that must be given to the pet monthly . <p> Paravax has sold the rights to market the canine heartworm vaccine to Bayer , just as it did with the Toxoplasma gondii vaccine , because the firm needed money to continue its research . Paravax plans to keep the rights to the cat vaccine and to future products in order to market them itself . The company recently hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling its products . He will hire a full sales staff once the drugs get closer to final approval . <p> The only thing Paravax wo n't do is manufacture its drugs . <p> " We 'd rather put the money into our lab and into research . We do n't see much value in manufacturing , " Schwarzer said . " The real value is in research and development , and in marketing , which we plan to do in an innovative and aggressive manner . " <p> The company was formed in 1988 in order to do research on parasite vaccines , thus its name . <p> It was started by a venture capital firm , Barr Dolan Charter Ventures , but recently got additional financing in a $ 10 million equity agreement from Volendam Investeringen N.V. , an off-shore investment fund . <p> In searching for people to lead the company , Charter Ventures found Robert B. Grieve , a former professor of parasitology in the department of pathology at Colorado State University 's veterinary school . <p> Grieve , who 's now the chief scientific officer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CSU at the time . The initial research at Paravax focused on developing a vaccine to prevent heartworm infections in dogs and cats . <p> Unlike biotech companies trying to develop genetic drugs to treat humans , Paravax is not tied to a single product to make or break it . The costs of testing human drugs is so high that most companies can financially handle only one drug at a time . If that drug fails , the companies generally ends up out of business or bought out . <p> A tribute to the difference between a single-product human biotech company and Paravax 's diverse veterinary biotech research is found in its own office cubicles and furnishings . Paravax recently bought the equipment from Synergen Inc. for 20 cents on the dollar . Synergen was a Boulder biotech company developing a treatment for inflammation and infections , but its main drug failed in extensive testing . The company that once saw its stock trade as high as $ 72 per share , was sold last year to Amgen Inc. for $ 9.25 per share . <p> Paravax also is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena , including a periodontal treatment for dogs and cats and diagnostic products such as a test to identify flea allergy dermatitis . <p> " There 's great diversity of risk . Even if half of our products fail , and we do n't think they will , we 'll still do very well , " CEO Schwarzer said . " That makes this a very viable stand-alone company and a pretty unusual biotech investment . " <p> No animal testing is conducted at the Paravax plant . All of those tests are performed under contract by CSU , in accordance with the university 's animal welfare guidelines . <p> Paravax has been the subject of merger or takeover interest from larger companies , but has no intent to sell , Schwarzer said . <p> " A more likely scenario is far-reaching partnerships where we retain the independence to make decisions and develop products quickly .
