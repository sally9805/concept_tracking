JOB INSECURITY GOT YOU DOWN ? WORried about all those new dead-end , low-pay McJobs that masquerade as gainful employment ? Maybe the U.S. should look to Europe , where unions are still muscular , minimum wages high , and most workers insulated from the brutal hire-and-fire culture that characterizes mid-1990s America . <P> Then again , maybe not . The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries . Call it Eurosclerosis  --  the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship . Symptoms : Europe 's unemployment rate of 11% is twice as high as the U.S. 's , and its job-creation chart is a flat line . Over the past three years , the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs , Europe none . Significantly , many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages , and as many as 60% are managerial or professional . <P> European workers will take to the streets against any attempt to reweave their safety net . Who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers are entitled to 45 days ' pay for each year of service . Two weeks is typical for the U.S. But the price of such protection is stagnation . Firing workers , even for cause , is so pricey that employers are reluctant to hire them in the first place . So Spain pays for its kindness with a jobless rate of more than 20% , Europe 's highest . Italy , although more entrepreneurial than Spain , has similar laws and an unemployment rate of 12% . Textile-factory boss Marina Salaman of Treviso needs new staff but admits , " A lot of times I hold off hiring because once you 've hired someone , it 's very hard to get rid of them . " Or to keep them . Germany , with some of the top manufacturing pay in the world ( $32 an hour , including fringe benefits ) , is in a panic over rising joblessness , at 11.1% the highest since World War II , because investment is moving to lower-cost places . <P> Europeans point to underemployment  --  those low-paying McJobs again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes America 's $4.25 look cheesy . ( President Clinton is proposing a 21% increase , to $5.15 , over two years ; expect a fight . ) No Frenchman works for less , but that means many are n't working at all . Joblessness among young people , hit hardest by minimum-wage laws , is roughly twice France 's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12% . <P> Even those who disdain the American system admit now their own is badly broken . President Jacques Chirac of France , who hosted a jobs summit last week of the seven rich industrial countries , called for a " third path " between the too cozy welfare state and the " precarious " U.S. labor market . Taking the American approach immediately is simply not an option . " Any political party that tried would run into a cultural wall upholding public service , entitlements , paid vacations and so forth , " says Jean-Marie Chevalier , a University of Paris economics professor . " They 'd be kicked out in one day . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
