In my time I have promulgated only two inviolable laws of American presidential politics . One of them is that our respect for a presidential candidate is at its highest just after he has announced his decision to withdraw from the race . The other is that sooner or later every Administration makes us nostalgic for the Administration that preceded it . You can imagine how gratified I am to have seen both my laws demonstrated in recent days . I 'm beginning to understand the little buzz that Einstein must have felt when year after year the universe seemed to be steaming along just the way he said it would . <P> Admit that you found yourself admiring John Kasich last week when he withdrew from the Republican presidential race . It 's said that Kasich , who never got past the single digits in the polls and had mustered the sort of funds that would be considered tip money by the campaign of George Quincy Bush , was simply being realistic . He ca n't win . My point , exactly . Given the fever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes as a welcome surprise . When Orrin Hatch gets realistic enough to withdraw , he 'll be praised with comments like " He was n't really all that bad " or " I 've seen sillier . " Believe me . It 's a law . <P> My other law kicks in when , partly because of the intensity of White House media coverage , the incumbent begins to grate on your nerves . By the time George Bush the Elder left the White House , you were tired of him and tired of Kennebunkport and tired of all those numbingly respectable Cabinet officers who looked as if they 'd all gone to Andover together . And you were sick to death of that wretched dog . You were starting to miss the buccaneering days of the Reagan Administration , during which TIME once devoted several pages to mug shots of all the Reagan officials who 'd had ethical or legal charges leveled against them  --  a layout that looked like the life insurance-company ads congratulating the leading salesmen of the tristate area . Now , after 6 1/2 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Bush era who never came near getting indicted . The vision of Brent Scowcroft dozing in the Oval Office brings a warm glow . <P> This , of course , works to the advantage of Bush the Younger , whose last name carries a warmth it did n't have in 1991 , and to the disadvantage of Hillary Clinton , whose family is at that stage of an Administration at which a lot of Americans are thinking , " We 'll be glad to see the back of you . " It 's not just what the press is now calling " Clinton fatigue . " It 's an inviolable law of presidential politics . <P> If the 2000 race goes as predicted , of course , it will be only a few years before Americans start finding themselves a little irritated with Bush the Younger , who by then may have demonstrated that he not only ca n't tell Slovenia from Slovakia but also has a little trouble distinguishing Iran from Iraq . You could find yourself thinking , " One thing about Clinton  --  that boy knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time before you were admitting to yourself , " I miss ol ' Webb Hubbell . The man was a hoot ! " That would be the time for Bill Clinton to run for the Senate from Arkansas .
