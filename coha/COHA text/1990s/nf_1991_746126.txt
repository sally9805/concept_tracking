I <p> Heraclitus DK107 reads as follows : It is readily translated : " Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for those with barbarian psychai . " However , this fragment is not readily interpreted . The problem is that we do not know what the phrase " barbarian psychai " means ; and as long as this phrase remains uninterpreted , the import of DK107 is unclear . I shall argue that no previous interpretation of the phrase " barbarian psychai " is satisfactory ; and I shall offer a more adequate interpretation of that key phrase . First , however , a few preliminary comments : <p> DKI07 asserts that persons with barbarian psychai have eyes and ears which are " bad witnesses " . This assertion suggests that persons with nonbarbarian psychai have eyes and ears which are " good witnesses . " For Heraclitus , as no doubt for the Greeks generally , a good witness is one who attests to what is the case and who does not attest to what is not the case . 2 Therefore , for " eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide information leading to a false apprehension of the world . There are two ways they might provide such information : ( 1 ) Eyes and ears might convey inaccurate information , and ( 2 ) eyes and ears might convey accurate information which is misinterpreted by psyche . Only ( 2 ) allows for the dependence of " bad witnessing " upon " having barbarian psychai " that is evident from the syntax of m13. 3 Hence , the function of psyche which a barbarian psyche fails to carry out is to properly interpret information , conveyed by the senses , that is basically reliable . 4 <p> It is not hard to determine how a non-barbarian psyche would interpret the information that is conveyed by the senses . Heraclitus ' chief concern is to emphasize that the cosmos , and the conflicting opposites of which it is composed , are somehow " unified . " For example , in DK57 he asserts that Hesiod " did not recognize that day and night are one " ; and it is no exaggeration to say that the fragments contain dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the " unity of opposites . " 5 In general there is , in Heraclitus , a pervasive and relentless emphasis on the urgent necessity to recognize that reality is not atomistic and pluralistic , but is actually systematically interconnected . There is also a corresponding theme of censure and denigration of the failure of most persons to recognize this unity . Therefore , it is reasonable to take barbarian psychai to belong to persons who fail to recognize the unity that Heraclitus sees everywhere . <p> For present purposes it is not essential to explore the notion of unity in Heraclitus further . However , it is essential to remark the connection between understanding unity and understanding Heraclitus ' logos . Understanding the logos is essential to understanding the systematic and interconnected nature of the cosmos . In DK50 Heraclitus states " having heard not me , but the logos , it is wise to agree that all things are one . " Once one hears the logos  --  and , presumably , understands it  --  one agrees that " all things are one . " One may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the necessity to recognize that reality is systematically interconnected ; for the latter does not take place without the former . II <p> I turn now to the problem of interpreting the phrase " barbarian psychai . " Virtually all commentators have taken " barbarian psychai " to refer to a lack or failure of linguistic ability . They have done so because the word " barbaros " was originally used to denote a person who does not speak ( or understand ) Greek . The resulting interpretation of DKI07 is inevitably something like this example : " Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for those whose psychai do not understand the language . " Now we know that a barbarian psyche is one that " does not understand the language . " However , we still do not know which language a barbarian psyche fails to understand . Thus , a complete interpretation of DK107 must specify which language a barbarian psyche fails to understand . <p> Concerning this issue there are two main views . According to the most common view , the " language " in question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who fail to understand the " language of the senses " 6 or the " language of nature . " 7 In the following discussion this view will be referred to as the " metaphorical interpretation . " A few commentators argue that " the language " should not be interpreted as metaphorical , but should be taken literally , so that those with barbarian psychai are those who fail to understand their own language. 8 In the following discussion this view will be referred to as the " literal interpretation . " 9 <p> Neither the literal interpretation nor the metaphorical interpretation of " barbarian psychai " is satisfactory . Against the metaphorical interpretation , it may be urged that neither does nature create the regularly constructed , meaningful strings of words and sounds which constitute language , nor do the senses perceive such phenomena in nature . Therefore , to speak of a " language of the senses , " or of a " language of nature " is , in effect , to refer to a non-linguistic language . Metaphor seems to depend to a considerable extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them must have a property that ( so to speak ) can be mentally transferred to the other one ; and this property will be something that it makes more or less sense to impute to both things . <p> We can not meaningfully relate the discursive , verbal language of our experience to an imagistic language of sensation , or of nature . Hence , we can not explicate the metaphor " language of nature " ( or " language of the senses " ) other than , perhaps , to say that it attributes meaning to things . Therefore , the metaphorical interpretation is unsatisfactory , because it does not contribute to our understanding of DKI07 . It leaves us with an explication of " barbarian psychai " that itself stands in need of further interpretation . <p> Another , and more serious , criticism of the metaphorical interpretation is that the language that persons with barbarian psychai fail to understand must be the logos , and so there is little point in speaking of a distinct " language of sensation " at all . The importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ; surely the barbarian psyche is one that does not understand that " opposites are unified , " that " all things are one , " and so forth . If not , then DK107 refers to a kind of epistemic failure that is mentioned nowhere else in the fragments ; and it does not refer to a kind of knowledge  --  viz. , of the unity of opposites  --  that is mentioned throughout the fragments . In order to recognize or understand unity , a person must understand , or come to know , the logos. 10 Therefore , it would appear that DKI07 simply asserts that persons who fail to understand the logos fail to recognize the unity of opposites , or of the cosmos . <p> It remains to consider the literal interpretation , according to which persons with barbarian psychai are those who fail to understand their own language . This view was offered by Martha Nussbaum in a well-known study of psyche in Heraclitus. 11 Nussbaum states the view in this way : " Heraclitus is not making the rather bland and vague statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the far more interesting statement that your senses will deceive you if you do not have an accurate understanding of your own language . " <p> Nussbaum 's view seems to be that " to have an accurate understanding of one 's language " is to recognize that discourse is a whole composed of a connected plurality of discrete units , viz. , words : Language is a unitary phenomenon which subsumes and organizes a vast plurality of subordinate phenomena . The cosmos is also a unitary phenomenon which subsumes and organizes a vast plurality of subordinate phenomena . The organized , unitary character of language mirrors the organized , unitary character of the cosmos . Thus , to understand one 's language is to understand the cosmos . <p> The literal interpretation is supported by a number of considerations . To the early Greeks , there was a very close tie between language and reality ; words were thought to be essentially linked to their referents , so that the meaning of a word was ( somehow ) not distinct from the nature of the object to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek thought , and seems to have been seriously examined no earlier than the Cratylus of Plato . Language is obviously very important to Heraclitus ; he refers to " names " several times , and several times he speaks of " hearing " the logos . Furthermore , it appears that Heraclitus derived his all-important doctrine of the unity of opposites  --  at least in part  --  from reflecting on language . 13 Finally , the etymology of " logos " itself is consistent with the literal interpretation . Etymologically , " logos " connotes both an " account " and a " gathering . " 14 An account is a gathering of a subordinate plurality of words , and it is reasonable to believe that Heraclitus viewed this one-many relationship as somehow paralleling or mirroring the large-scale organization of the cosmos . <p> The literal interpretation is well-supported , and it seems to yield basically the same common-sense interpretation of DK107 as was mentioned above . To review , this was " eyes and ears are bad witnesses for persons who fail to understand the logos . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that it imputes an anachronistic conception of understanding to Heraclitus . According to Nussbaum , the logos is merely Heraclitus ' " account " ; that is , his exhortation that persons must understand the synthetic nature of their own language . I will attempt to show that the way in which Heraclitus refers to " understanding " the logos suggests that he has a much different conception of understanding than that which we associate with understanding a language . This conception is so different from our own that it both warrants and necessitates a novel interpretation of DK107 . III <p> It is now necessary to discuss the ontological status of the logos . Of course , this topic is a matter of controversy . Some writers maintain that the logos is simply an account , whereas others maintain that it is not wholly a verbal and linguistic phenomenon , but a real ingredient of Heraclitus ' cosmos . I agree with those who maintain that the logos exists independently of language , although it may be represented in and by language . My reasons are as follows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . Fragment DK1 begins " although this logos holds forever , people always fail to understand it , both before hearing it and after they once have heard . " Since people fail to understand the logos before they have heard it , the logos can not be simply an account . To be sure , Heraclitus does speak of hearing the logos , and this reference guarantees that it is , to some extent , coextensive with Heraclitus ' utterances . However , it would be impossible to misunderstand the logos before hearing it , unless it were possible to misunderstand it by means of another sense than hearing ; for example , by sight . And if so , then the logos can not be simply Heraclitus ' account . <p> Second , Heraclitus explicitly disavows the logos as his logos : DK50 states that " having heard not me but the logos , it is wise to agree that all things are one . " This fragment begins with the words " ouk emou , " " not to me , " which are therefore emphasized ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , but should be , heard without listening to Heraclitus . It says , in effect , " don ' ! listen to me , listen to the logos ; if you do , then you will agree that all things are one . " If the logos were solely an account , it would be absurd for Heraclitus to advise his audience not to listen to him . To be sure , in this fragment Heraclitus addresses an audience that is conceived as listening to him in some sense , viz. , as hearing his words . The distinction between " listening to Heraclitus " and " listening to the logos " seems to consist in a difference between Heraclitus ' words and something that can be heard , so to speak , " over and above " or " through " his actual words . It is as though Heraclitus thinks of the logos as a suprapersonal agent or entity that speaks " through " him . <p> Third , the logos seems to be an eternal " law of becoming . " In DK1 the logos is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that " all things come to pass in accordance with the logos . " Elsewhere ( DK41 ) Heraclitus states that " wisdom is one thing : to understand the plan by which all things are steered through all . " In this fragment the word translated as " plan " is " gnome. " and it is reasonable to suppose that " gnome " stands for the logos : there is a strong similarity between a logos to which everything conforms , and a plan by which " all things are steered . " Also , gnome is cognate to ginoskein , a word that Heraclitus often uses to denote " recognition " or " grasp " of the logos. 15 <p> On the basis of the evidence just reviewed , it is possible to view the logos as something like a law of nature , and so not necessarily a real ingredient of the cosmos ; just as , for example , the laws of mechanics do not physically commingle with the things whose behavior they regulate . However , it seems anachronistic to consider the logos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . For it is far from clear whether Heraclitus had , or could have had , a developed sense of the distinction between " true description " and " the way things are . " The Presocratic worldview is fatuously corporeal and in many ways " pre-dualistic " ; for example , Heraclitus did not recognize distinctions as basic as those between substance and attribute , and form and matter . 16 As noted earlier , the distinction between words and things was not even sharply drawn until long after Heraclitus lived . Therefore , it seems that the linguistic interpretation of the logos may be maintained only by attributing a suspiciously advanced level of conceptual sophistication to Heraclitus . <p> Fourth , Heraclitus refers , in DK114 , to a " divine law " : " Those who speak with sense must rely on what is common to all , just as a city must rely on its law , and much more strongly : for all human laws are nourished by one law , the divine law ; for it prevails insofar as it wishes and suffices for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment the word for " nourish " suggests that there is a concrete , biological , relationship between the divine law and human laws . The word for " prevail " invokes the dominant relation of a sovereign to his subjects , of a conqueror to the conquered , or of a divinity to mortals ; the word for " suffice " recalls the " absolute power " of a god , and the word for " be left over " invokes immortality . In short , the divine law of DKI14 counts as a divinity in Heraclitus ' highly original pantheon. 18 <p> Of course , the linguistic interpretation of the logos may still be maintained by insisting that Heraclitus ' logos simply describes the workings of the divine law . However , the linguistic interpretation claims that the logosis not an actual ingredient of the cosmos ; and DK 114 shows that Heraclitus is capable of thinking of a law as an actual ingredient of the cosmos. 19 <p> Fifth , a play on words in DK114 shows that the logos is the same as the divine law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on what is common to all . " Here " with sense " is and " what is common " ( leaving out the article ) is . That is , the phrase " with sense , is phonetically and visually almost identical to the word for " what is common . " Given the deep significance that Heraclitus saw in such verbal parallels , this near-identity reveals that to be " with sense " is the same , somehow , as " what is common . " 20 We know from other fragments that the logos is that which is " common . " Therefore , there is excellent reason to identify the logos and the divine law of DK114 and little , if any , reason not to . <p> Sixth , the logos is " limitless . " Fragment DK45 states : " Travelling , you would not find the limits of psyche , even going everywhere ; so deep a logos does it have . " This fragment says that no matter where you go , the limits of psyche can not be found . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last clause of DK45 states why psyche is limitless ; viz. , because it has a very " deep " logos . Therefore , psyche is limitless because its logos is limitless . Now , the logos of psyche must be the same as the logos per se  --  otherwise Heraclitus would have two distinct but all-pervasive logoi on his hands . Therefore , it would appear that all psychai contain an admixture of the logos ( in a way that perhaps adumbrates the Platonic concept of " participation " ) . The property of being without limits places the logos in the tradition of Milesian archai. 21 Anaximander , of course , had posited " to apeiron , " and Anaximenes had posited " unlimited " air as the primary entities in their respective cosmologies . Therefore , the logos appears not merely to exist , but  --  as is otherwise apparent  --  to be a primary component of the Heraclitean cosmos . IV <p> This concludes my review of reasons for taking the logos to be a real ingredient of the cosmos , rather than an account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the logos . <p> The fragments show that Heraclitus formulated his conception of knowledge with regard for the principle of " like-to-like . " This principle pervades Greek thought , and was considered to govern the behavior of a very wide variety of phenomena. 22 According to the principle of like-tolike , only things that are relevantly similar can interact in any way . The principle has mainly been recognized in later Presocratic thought , for example in Empedocles ' theory of sense-perception . He says " For with earth do we see earth , with water we see water , " and so forth. 23 However , one version of like-to-like was already proverbial in Homer : Odyssey 17 , lines 217 and 218 read ( in Lattimore 's translation ) " see now how the rascal comes on leading a rascal , as ever god leads like to like . " In general , " the principle governs early Greek philosophy to a very considerable extent . " 24 <p> The principle of like-to-like seems to play a role in Presocratics prior to Heraclitus . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " the various basic materials with which it interacts , in the sense that is not " opposed " to any basic material ( I assume here that the Presocratic standard for " unlikeness " would have been " opposition " ) . The same may be said of the " limitless air " of Anaximenes . However , the evidence for liketo-like in earlier Presocratics is comparatively indirect . In Heraclitus , by contrast , the principle plays an unmistakable role , viz. , with regard to the relation of psyche to logos . <p> As is well known , Heraclitus conceived of his cosmos as essentially fiery : one fragment ( DK30 ) states that the cosmos is an " everliving fire " ; another ( DK67 ) refers to a fiery god that seems to be coextensive with the cosmos ; and a third ( DK31 a ) alludes to a process of physical transformation that begins with the " turning " of fire into sea . The logos that informs and regulates the fiery cosmos is also fiery , as fragment DK64 implies : " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery instrument of Zeus , and here it is said to have the same universal , regulative function as is elsewhere ascribed to the logos . That the logos is fiery may also be inferred from the fact that it is immanent in the fiery cosmos . <p> Heraclitus makes knowledge or wisdom  --  either of which can only mean " knowledge/understanding of the logos "  --  a function of the fieriness of one 's psyche . In DK36 he states that " for psychai it is death to become water , for water it is death to become earth ; out of earth water arises , and out of water psyche arises . " As Kirk has pointed out , in this fragment psyche takes the place of fire. 25 Hence , psyche is essentially fiery . However , psyche may become moist , without becoming so moist as to perish : according to DKlI7 , " whenever he is drunk , a man is led , stumbling , by a beardless boy , not knowing where he goes , with his psyche moist . " Here ignorance is correlated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DK118 , states that " a dry psyche is wisest and best . " Therefore , knowledge of the logos waxes and wanes as psyche increases or decreases in similarity  --  i.e. , fieriness  --  relative to the logos. 26 Evidently Heraclitus conceived of the epistemic relation between logos and psyche in terms of a material likeness or similarity that ( at least ) approaches identity . V <p> It has been seen that psyche is wise  --  that is , knows or understands the logos  --  only when it exemplifies the fieriness of the logos . Therefore , it appears that Heraclitus did not conceive of knowledge of the logos in the same way that we conceive of knowledge of language . We tend to conceive of knowledge of language in a Cartesian way , in that language is regarded as a body of propositions and rules for forming propositions , and not as a physical ingredient of the universe . Heraclitus , in contrast , conceived of knowledge of the logos in ontological and cosmological terms : it appears that psyche only knows the logos by more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That Heraclitus actually conceived of knowledge in terms of material " likeness " is shown further by a highly suggestive complex of associations between the logos  --  characterized as xynos ( that is , " common , " or " universal " )  --  and " synienai , " a word that Heraclitus uses to connote " understanding . " We have seen from DK114 that Heraclitus associated intelligence or wisdom with knowledge of the logos , that which is " common to all . " To review , in DK114 the phrase for " with sense " is , and the phrase for what is common is . This pun shows that robe with sense is somehow to be the same as " what is common , " viz. , the logos . <p> If to understand the logos is to be " in common " with it , then to be ignorant of the logos must be to he " a-xynos , " i.e. , " not in common " with the xynos logos . " Axynos " is not a word in Greek , but Heraclitus uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logos holds forever , persons always fail to understand it . " Here the word for " those who fail to understand " is " axynetoi , " which is the privative form of the adjective " xynetos , " which is derived from " synienai , " " to understand . " The presence of " axynetos " further suggests that Heraclitus considered ignorance of the logos to be due to a lack of commonality of ignorati with the logos . <p> The word " axynetos " occurs in one other fragment . According to DK34 " those who have heard the logos and still fail to understand are like the deaf .... " Here " those who fail to understand " are " axynetoi . " The verb " synienai " itself occurs in DK51 : " They do not understand ( ou xyniasin ) how a thing being at variance agrees with itself ; there is a backstretched harmony , like the bow or the lyre . " Here " ou xyniasin " conveys the same message as the two instances of " axynetoi " ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privative alpha . Here again the verbal resonance of " xyniasin " with " xynos ; *suggests that ignorance is due to a lack of commonality of psyche with the logos , i.e. , with that which is responsible for the unity of opposites . <p> Thus Heraclitus ' use of " synienai " provides strong support for the view that he conceived of knowledge in terms of material likeness. 28 The root meaning of this verb is also suggestive : " Like many Greek syn-verbs , ' synienai ' has a basically physical or spatial meaning . " In Homer , the cognate noun " xynesis " denotes the confluence of two rivers. 29 Also , forms of " synienai " " generally convey a sense of coming or bringing together , whether in conflict or in agreement . " Therefore , the root meaning of " synienai " : ( a ) is consistent with the idea that there is a physical and spatial relationship between the logos and psychai that know the logos ; ( b ) suggests that the subject and object of knowledge literally commingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal conflict of opposites ; and ( d ) contains overtones of " agreement. 30 It would appear that Heraclitus could not have used a more appropriate word to suggest commonality , or lack of commonality  --  i.e. , material likeness or unlikeness  --  of psyche and logos . <p> All in all , there is a great deal of evidence that Heraclitus did not conceive of " understanding the logos " as distinct from " becoming fiery . " This evidence has been reviewed in an attempt to show that the literal **28;1149;TOOLONG an anachronistic conception of understanding to Heraclitus , viz. , our own conception of understanding our language , or understanding something about the nature of our language . Given Heraclitus ' conception of understanding , it therefore appears that DK107 is to be interpreted as follows : " Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for those whose psychai are foreign to the logos . " <p> That is , a barbarian psyche is one that is foreign to the logos , as a barbaros is foreign to Ionia or Ephesus . It is true that the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a barbaros was , in a more basic sense , simply one who was alien , or different. 31 If one focuses exclusively on the fact that a barbaros was a person who did not speak or understand Greek , one may arrive at the literal interpretation of DK107 . However , as has been shown , this interpretation depends upon a questionable estimate of the ontological status of the logos , and it also fails to take into account a good deal of evidence that Heraclitus conceived of understanding in terms of material likeness between psyche and the logos . Given Heraclitus ' conception of understanding , and given the originality with which he used the Greek language , it is reasonable to view barbarian psychai as those which are " outsiders " relative to the single item that both unifies the cosmos and  --  through literal , physical presence " in " psychai 32  --  makes knowledge of this unity possible . <p>
