Ready to move up into the cruiser realm ? Chaparral 's Signature 240 is a seductive new bundle of pleasures that will steal your heart away . By Roy Attaway Photograph // Ahead on the lake , bright orange floats for a water-ski course look like a temporary landing strip laid down by space aliens . It seems fitting , because I feel a bit like Han Solo at the controls of the Millennium Falcon . But , there is no Wookiee guttering in my ear , just Mike Munsch 's calm voicesomewhat expansive with pride : " Our claim to fame is the hull design , " he is saying . I ease the throttles forward and the Chaparral Signature 240 climbs quickly out of the hole and cypress , pine and tupelo streak past like vanishing galaxies . We make a wide circle of one part of Twin Lakes , Ga. , then shoot through the gap into the other . Room to maneuver on these small , spring-fed lakes is limited , but it is enough to get a good feel for the performance characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cruiser market . " This is your first cruiser , " Mike continues . " It 'll give you a chance to see how you like it . " We stop the boat in the lee of a point aflame with flowering dogwood and azalea . I am developing a crush on this svelte little honey already . Reminds me of this girl in high school , who was also curvy and kind of fast .... But , that 's another story . Let 's just say , she would have loved this boat . Photograph TEA FOR TWO : Or dinner for four . V-berth makes up into cozy dinette with stowaway table . Photograph DUCK SOUP : The galley Is contained in one unit , with sink , stove , fridge and microwave . // To Chaparral , this is a " boat of destiny " because it replaces their Signature 24 , one of their best-sellers . But , it is not a rejiggered 24 or anything else , Mike goes on , " We redesign every cruiser from the keel up . " What the 240 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Chaparral 's Extended V-Plane hull . The concept is similar to that used by Cobalt . It translates simply into a transom that goes straight down . " This gives extra flotation at the stern , " Mike says . " It 's like having built-in trim tabs . " The result is a hull that tracks well , planes nicely , and-as witnessedpops up with less dig . Ever mindful that they are replacing a classic , Chaparral agonized over the details of the 240 . The result is predictable : a well-found cruising boat with a multiplicity of thoughtful particulars . On the bow , for instance , Chaparral did away with the expected pulpit and put the anchor system under the deck . We 've seen this on other boats recently , and applaud . It makes for a cleaner ( ergo safer ) foredeck . Fewer things to trip over . Access to this foredeck is through a gate in the one-piece stainless windshield . There is a step on the left side of the console to help you up and in . Photograph HELMSMANSHIP : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout // Cockpit space is dealt with deftly , too . The helm seat is double-wide ( unless you 're Paul Prudhomme ) and backed up with a mirror-image seat . The helm seat is adjustable , and the two fold down to form a sunpad . ( There is stowage underneath . ) And , about that helm station : modular , done in ecru rather than white to reduce glare , and with a nice clustering of instruments and switches . Wood-grain finish on the dash panel and wheel spokes adds a touch of Continental class . The wheel , by the way , is a padded , automotive style . To port of this is a fore-and-aft padded bench seat that also will accommodate two . At the foot of this is an insulated cooler with a padded top . Another bench seat fronts the transom-minus space for an access door , to port . Just abaft this is the swim platform with a telescoping ladder ( very easy to use with only one hand ) and an insulated space that may be used for personal gear stowage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top folds back into a kind of faux radar arch , which-when you think about it-is a nice solution . I find it not at all obtrusive ; it actually adds panache to the design . But , it is in the cabin that you may lose your heart entirely and begin life as a cruising yachtsman . Well , boatsman , anyway . For openers , there is almost full headroom ( for some , maybe even completely full headroom ; I 'm 6 ' 1 " ) . Forward is the ubiquitous V-berth with a filler cushion that makes up into a roomy double . There is , of course , a removable table that converts the space into a dinette for four . In the middle of the cabin is a galley that reminds me of an apartment I used to live in on 64th Street in Manhattan . It is all of a piece , small , but efficient , with the fridge under a counter holding a sink with pressurized water and a oneburner electric stove . Over this is a microwave oven ( an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entertainment center . ( There is a 11 OV outlet on the after side of the unit . ) I used to cook Pheasant au Chambertin for six on a unit this size . O.K. , I had two burners . But my then-girlfriend ( now wife ) Robyn had to wash salad greens in the bathroom . The head also is small ( hey , this is a 24-foot boat ! ) , but well designed . It includes a Porta Potti and a sink . There is a telephone-style shower that operates off of a nipple on the faucet . Even in a boat so small , Chaparral managed to incorporate a double quarter berth , which is situated aft , under the deck . " We went to a lot of trouble to get this right , " Mike Munsch says , " so you 'd wake up and have the light in your face . Much less claustrophobic . " What they did was incorporate an opening portlight into the underside of the port bench seat . The main cabin , in general , is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed portlights and a large hatch-large enough to be of service in an emergency . Thank you . Power on this model was the peppy Merc 5.7L EFI Bravo Three at 220 hp . Engine access is through hatches in the deck . This particular boat , which was headed out to a dealer , had a number of factory-installed options , including the Overnight Package ( AC/DC fridge ; alcohol-electric stove ; battery charger/converter ; electric outlets-120V ; hot-water heater with heat exchanger ; Merc cathode corrosion protection system ; shore power with cord ; starboard windshield wiper ; pump-out Porta Potti ; shower curtain ) , cockpit carpeting , cockpit table , compass , a transom shower , tilt steering wheel , digital depthsounder , and trim tabs , which add $5,266 to the base price of $37,767 . Obviously , the Signature 240 is the end result of years of experience . Thirty-two years , to be exact . It all goes back to 1965 when young Buck Pegg decided he could build a better boat himself . A few years later , he was joined by Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map-a very large map , indeed , with 125 dealers in 46 states and 60 dealers in 35 foreign countries . So , just who did they have in mind when they designed this one ? Just about anybody . The most eligible bachelor on the lake or the family man . All you need is a dollop of adventure in your soul . // <p>
