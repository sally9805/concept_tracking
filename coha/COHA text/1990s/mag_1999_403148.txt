// OFF THE CHARTS Since going public in May 1997 , Internet retailer Amazon.com has seen its stock rocket up more than 2,000% . Compang founder Jeff Bezos now has a net worth of more than S4 billion . // CAN WE TALK ? This Internet thing has gotten crazy Unknown little companies go public and bam ! , their share prices shoot up like starbursts . VG*'hoever heard of eBay or Ticketmaster OnlineCitysearch a few months ago ? Now they have market caps as big as K Mart 's and B.E Goodrich 's , respectively . And they 've made some people-some very lucky people-very , very rich . It 's enough to make betterknown Internet companies like America Online , Yahoo ! and Amazon.com seem like solid blue chips . But they 're not . Even these stocks have been rising and falling more in a single day than most stocks do in a year . And like their newer IPO brethren , they 've produced gains that are simply astonishing . Had you been wise or daring enough to purchase 100 shares each of AOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost , then , of roughly $21,500-by the end of November the stake would have mushroomed to $111,800 . That 's a gain of 419% , or some 400% more than Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index . What exactly is going on ? The irrational exuberance that Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan questioned back at Dow 6400 is nothing compared with the Internet exuberance we 're seeing now . Net start-ups with no history of earnings go public and their twentysomething founders watch investors bid their stocks up more than 600% ( see " Inside an Internet IPO " on page 101 ) . Companies that announce ventures having anything at all to do with the Internet or that simply have a . com in their names are almost guaranteed a big pop in price . Trading is so frenzied that many online brokerages are restricting trading of certain Net stocks . Some are also requiring investors who buy Internet stocks with borrowed funds to keep more collateral on hand to cover their loans . For months , even before its merger with Netscape , America Online has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Stock Exchange . The action has been so fast and furious that even devout disciples of the Internet are stunned . In the chat room of one financial Website-the cyberspace equivalent of an office watercooler discussion-a group of investors who follow Amazon ( ticker symbol : AMZN ) exchanged these reactions to the stock 's remarkable trajectory : " AMZNing , " wrote one . " Amazombies , " scoffed another . " Kick back and smell the tulips , " posted a third , referring to the notorious speculative frenzy of 1634 , when the price of tulip bulbs went sky-high among Dutch speculators-and then crashed . // NET GAINS THAT ARE HARD TO IGNORE // The story driving up Net stocks is simple and compelling : The Internet is changing the way we shop , communicate and do business , and those companies that lead the transformation may well dominate the Web marketplace of the future . But there is also little doubt that , on the investment front , we are deep into a stock mania of historic proportions . " The frenetic buying in the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says analyst Rick Berry of J.P . Turner &; Co . " It 's probably the most absurd thing I 've seen in my life . " WHAT HISTORY TEACHES MARKETS HAVE BEEN rOlled by many a mania , but there has never been anything like this . Perhaps the closest parallel in modern times is the biotechnology boom of the late 1980s and early ' 90s , when stocks such as Genentech tore up and down the charts . In less than 18 months , Genentech 's stock jumped 375% on the promise of a clotbusting heart-attack drug . The frenzy was so wild that , like today , brokerages raised their requirements for investors buying on margin . And sure enough , Genentech 's bubble burst , falling about 75% from its peak . But history also teaches a different lesson : Sometimes , when a technological revolution comes along , if you wait to buy until the outcome is secure and stock prices seem reasonable , you miss the big payday . Consider the legacy of software behemoth Microsoft . On its first day of public trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28 for a 33% gain . At the time , this was referred to in the press as " manic enthusiasm , " and from that day to this the stock has always looked expensive compared with others , at least on a current earnings basis . " There was never a right time ' to buy Microsoft , " says Credit Suisse First Boston senior analyst Bill Burnham . But if you waited , you lost . On the other hand , as Burnham notes , Microsoft may have seemed expensive through the years , but it never got near the valuation levels of Internet stocks today That 33% first-day rise pales in comparison with the Internet companies stampeding to market now . Microsoft 's price/earnings multiple back then , while considered pricey because it was above the market average , was still only 16 . No one even dreamed of the outlandish multiples we see today-and that 's for the few Net players that actually have earnings . Microsoft is also an example of how , if past technology cycles are any guide , the hot pioneers are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , the PC industry was well established . And several years earlier , the sector had been through a binge and bust of its own . Anybody remember Commodore ? Atari ? Tandy ? After turning red hot , those stocks began to fall in mid-1983 and fell for the next year or so . In February 1984 , a group of 24 PC stocks were , on average , 50% below their 52-week highs . " When you have a new industry or sector , " says Robert Farrell , senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch , " they get their wildest sponsorship and speculation at the very beginning when nobody knows what the earnings will be and you ca n't place a valuation on them . " Invariably , he says , that first stage goes to an excess that winds up with a correction . The lessons , then , of manias gone by : Investors can pay too much for even the best stock in a hot industry . Consider biotech darling Amgen . Even as the company posted 27% annual earnings growth from 1991 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-1993 and did n't really surpass its mid-1991 level until 1995 . Industry pioneers do n't always survive . Witness Commodore , Atari . Be suspicious of copycat IPos . In the words of Edward M. Kerschner , chairman of PaineWebber 's investment policy committee , " Beware of mediocre companies that come to market simply because there is a demand for them . " No sure thing is as sure as it seems . " High-tech booms , " says Kerschner , " occur when cyclical trends in the stock market and economy favor an industry , but these trends can change rapidly . " That 's what happened to PC stocks in the ' 80s when capital spending weakened . But you ca n't win if you do n't play . Speculating on Atari proved costly . Speculating on Microsoft , however ... THE NEXT WAL-MART ? IF THERE IS one stock that captures the thrill , insanity and potential of Internet mania , it is Amazon.com , the online bookseller that is expanding into music and video . Since going public in May 1997 , Amazon has racked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cent . Amazon is the brainchild of Jeff Bezos , who at age 30 , while working for a New York hedge fund , was struck by a report on the phenomenal growth expected of the Internet . A few months later Bezos , his wife and their dog headed west in a Chevy Blazer , and while his wife drove , Bezos wrote a business plan on his laptop . Ultimately , the company would feature no actual stores , impressive inventory efficiency and this remarkable concept : Customers would pay Amazon well before Amazon paid its wholesalers . Four years later , Amazon is the fastest-growing Internet brand , and Bezos ' stake in the company is worth about $4 billion ( at least on paper ) . The company has been heralded by some as a potential " Wal-Mart of the Internet . " And that 's undoubtedly part of what investors find appealing about the company . On Oct. 28 , Amazon reported an operating loss of $21 million , or 490 per share . Yet investors sent the stock up 8. lolo the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stock was at $218-up 86% since the earnings report-and the company had announced a three-for-one split . Why such optimism ? The earnings report ( or , we should say , nonearnings report ) contained some dramatic figures : Revenue was up 306% from the previous year . Cumulative customer accounts grew to 4.5 million , up a record 1.2 million from the previous quarter and up 377% from the previous year . And in its first full quarter selling music , Amazon outsold all the established online music sellers-strong evidence that the Amazon brand has meaning . Building that brand has required huge marketing expenditures , which helps explain why Amazon remains unprofitable . An e-business consulting firm , IceGroup , of Wakefield , Mass. , caused a stir in August when it applied what it calls an " everyman 's point of view " analysis to Amazon 's financials . IceGroup calculated that it costs the company $55.91 to process its average order , but Amazon receives just $48.76 for that order " essentially creating a loss of $7.15 for each order processed , " says Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by analyst Henry Blodget of CIBC Oppenheimer , pegs the operating loss at $4.50 per order . ( An Amazon spokewoman responds : " We do n't disclose those figures .... That 's pure guesswork . " ) Photograph Nick Birbas , day trader specializing in Internet stocks // So you 've got a brand-name business growing like gangbusters on the hottest economic frontier-yet the more it grows , the more money it loses . What 's an investor to do ? " As of today , I 'd be more of a seller than a buyer of these stocks , ' says Keith Benjamin , BancBoston Robertson Stephens ' Internet analyst . " They 've been very volatile and are at alltime highs . I 'd wait for a correction . " But what 's a correction ? A $20-a-share fall ? A $40 fall ? In industries with a history , coming up with a buy price is easier , because valuations are more predictable . With Net stocks , nothing is easy . THE VALUATION DANCE TO GET A CHUCKLE ( or a groan ) out of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . Because so few of these companies make money , the traditional method of weighing the stock 's share price against the company 's earnings-the good old price to earnings ratio-does n't work In a recent report , Shaun Andrikopoulos of BT Alex . Brown notes that the methodologies he 's seen are " mind boggling " and " creative in their artistry . ' He 's found analysts attempting to put a value on Internet stocks by comparing a company 's market cap with its number of sales reps , its total employees , even the amount of electricity it consumes . One factor that makes analyzing Net stocks so difficult is that an analysis that makes sense for one may not work for another . That 's because some Net companies are retailers ( Amazon ) , some are essentially media companies ( Yahoo ! ) and some are software makers ( Netscape ) that started giving away software for free and tried to become media companies but are now merging with a very big Internet service provider ( AOL ) that is really a media company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness . Among the tools : Average cost to acquire a customer : For companies like AOL that have regular paying customers , this figure can help measure progress against competitors . But for Internet companies that rely solely on advertising or that are transaction-based retail businesses , this makes less sense . It also does n't help compare an Internet stock with a non-Internet stock . Price-to-revenue ratio : If a company does n't yet have earnings , analysts often focus on revenue growth , which at least is a hard number . CIBC 's Blodget pegs Amazon at a price-to-revenue multiple of about 17 . ( Wal-Mart 's , by comparison , is 1.4 ) . Boldget warns , however , that price to revenue is meaningful only if you figure in what profits those revenues are likely to produce . The razor-thin margins in Amazon 's current businesses , selling books and music CDs , mean that at best , " that revenue will give you a 10% operating profit , " he says . Discounted future stock price : This method uses projections about how the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues . In October , Blodget concluded that Amazon could have $10 billion in annual revenue within five years , with a 12% operating margin . The company would then generate earnings per share of $10 . After discounting those earnings back to the present year at a 15% discount rate and using a projected P/E multiple of 40 , Blodget can justify a price of more than $300 for Amazon . A more conservative forecast of just $2.75 in earnings per share in 2003 produces a target valuation of just $75 . " What this shows you is that valuations are very arbitrary , " says Blodget . " You 're really just buying a vision of the future . " HOW " tO PLAY THE MET IN MANY WAYS , of course , these valuation methods are merely rationalizations , attempts to explain why today 's Net prices are n't out of line . But they are out of line . The key for most investors is deciding whether they want to invest or speculate . If you 're okay with the risks , go ahead and enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see " What 's Left in the IPO Pipeline ? " on page 97 ) . Or play it more cautiously by buying stock in a profit-making market leader such as Yahoo ! or AOL . Or you can try to hedge your bets by buying a sector fund ( see " Internet Funds : Looking for a Safety Net , " on page 98 ) . But with all those choices , understand the risk you 're taking-and do n't venture anything you ca n't lose . As with other manias this bubble may well burst , and if it does , things will get ugly . So does that mean a prudent investor should sit back and watch so many others getting rich on this promising new industry ? Not necessarily . One other option is to go in through the side door-to latch on to the already profitable and established franchises making money from the Net . One top choice is MCIWorldCom , which we recommend in " 12 Best Investments for 1999 , " beginning on page 86 . You can also look at Cisco Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 38 ) , all of which should benefit from the Internet revolution . These stocks are n't cheap in an absolute sense , but relative to the pure-play Net stocks , they 're a bargain . ( Dell , for instance , still sells at only a modest premium to its unbelievable-and realprofit growth , as does Cisco . ) With these investments , you simply bet that use of the Web will continue to grow . You do n't have to figure out which company is going to win the battle for eyeballs . Says PaineWebber 's Kerschner : " You probably wo n't have as much of a thrill , but you probably wo n't feel as much of a kill . " Hey , it 's your nickel . . com Check out these companies .
