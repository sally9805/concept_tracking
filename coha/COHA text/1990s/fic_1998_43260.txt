In my essay for this issue of the Review of Contemporary Fiction , I have chosen to write about the Death Cunt in part because it is at the heart of the " gnostic vision " as I see it , and a recurrent theme in my own work . For this reason also , I have chosen brief instants from each of the five novels in which the " Death Cunt " appears or , as in the excerpt from Phosphor in Dreamland in which-a mere figment of the mind-she has been admirably ( ! ) overcome . From The Stain ( Earth ) Look carefully at the freshly disturbed soil and you will see shining in the sun a derelict rib . The scattered remains of persons deceased are revealed after thaws and heavy rains . Here little Charlotte will accumulate a singular set of ivory pawns : vertebrae , lunates , phalanges and molars . <p> Charlotte is seven years old . As is usual , her birthday is celebrated by a trip to the cemetery . Charlotte , in black wool coat and stockings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedged between her aunt and uncle for a morning of prayer . The late October sun is hot and the air heavy with the brute stench of boxwood . <p> As Edma prays and Emile dozes , Charlotte explores the cemetery with her immense grey-green eyes ( changeling eyes , Edma calls them , neither here nor there ) . She observes that the ornate mausoleum squatting ponderously to the left of her mother 's grave has a broken step that has slipped to reveal an inky crevice . And this crevice crawls with flies . The mausoleum 's stained and pitted frontage is also alive with flies , swarming multitudes clinging to the defunct family 's name like grapes . With a thrill , Charlotte recognizes the letters and reads the stones . And it is here , in the cemetery , that she will have her first lesson in geometry : God 's love is a circle Our Hearts sleep within Safe from Sin . and : <p> The triangle is perfect purityGod , His Son , the Holy GhostThe Blessed Trinity . Charlotte sees that the triangle itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wonders about the grinning cavity . What is inside ? She knows that a body was placed in the grave before her . Has a perfect soul escaped from that crack , she ponders , leaving in its wake perfect bones ? But clean bones do not explain the flies ' nagging presence . Flies are dirt-eaters , Aunt has told her often . They eat rotten things , they revel in de-compo-sition and where they settle to feed , they lay eggs-eggs that transform themselves into worms . Charlotte supposed that if the eggs of chickens were a gift of Light , the eggs of flies must be the gift of Darkness . <p> She thinks of all the flies she has ever seen collecting upon the indecipherable lumps of neglected chicken offal that Edma wrenches from the gaping corpses of chickens and throws into the kitchen yard-for the chickens . If chickens eat one another just as evil persons do ( Edma had pointed out such people in an illustrated newspaper article she had saved-sullen creatures with extravagantly knobby knees protruding grotesquely from beneath scanty grass skirts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can their eggs possibly be clean ? That morning , Charlotte comes to the irrevocable conclusion that eggs are not fit for human consumption . <p> " Aunt ! " she suddenly cries , forgetting that she must never interrupt Edma in prayer . " Aunt ! Where does the meat go ? " <p> Her question is answered by a nasty pinch on the cheek that leaves a mark , red and white , for many throbbing minutes . Charlotte wonders if cannibals eat family members and through silent tears gazes intently upon her mother 's grave . For the first time she sees that the wreath of glass beads moored there is shaped like an open mouth-a vertical mouth-quite large enough for Charlotte to pass through . Is the mouth a door ? Did her mother 's soul pass through that door on its way to Heaven ? After reflection , she decides that the mouth , having eaten and digested her mother 's meat , having sucked her bones clean , allowed her soul to escape as a sigh from its lips , leaving a perfect skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this confirms her discovery ( No wreath is visible on the far*ade of the mausoleum and this very neatly explains the presence of those spectacularly numerous flies . ) <p> Many years later , Charlotte will enter the mausoleum alone . She will find a wreath inside , but broken , its twisted wire frame having rusted and crumbled , the glass pearls , silver , blue and white , strewn across the tilted floor . <p> It is time to go home . Charlotte walks towards the gate sandwiched between her aunt and uncle . She sees a small bird perched naughtily on a cross ; a moon-shaped stone broken in two like a wafer ; smells the lush scent of chrysanthemums-those gallic flowers of death-and boxwood . And then she perceives a faint but persistent odor that , sickly sweet , frightens her and has to do with the unusually warm day , the heat , the meat , it dies , it flies . . . and they are passing the poorer graves , all marked off by squares of pink gravel , scalloped on the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Day , <p> Morning , Noon , Evening and Night , <p> The Square proclaims God 's might . <p> Unexpectedly , Edma stoops and carefully pulls up a small greygreen plant by the roots-a perennial she intends to add to the kitchen yard 's flower borders . Charlotte , choking on suppressed curiosity , takes advantage of the unexpected gesture and asks : <p> " Aunt , what does e.t.e.r.n.a.l . mean ? " <p> " E-E-E-ternal ! " Emile stutters . <p> " Eternal , " says Edma , pleased to answer a question she considers worthwhile , " is Forever . Like God . " <p> " F-F-F- " Emile adds . <p> " Is He Death , Aunt ? " <p> " He is Death and He is Life . He takes and He gives . For example , when you were born , your mother died . " <p> " Why did He make her die ? " <p> " She sinned against Him ! " <p> L-L-L-Lust ! " explains Emile . <p> Charlotte did not know what lust was , but she imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart that God would die . She would steal his wreath so that His soul and His bones and His meat would rot together . Forever . So that flies would feed upon His corpse . Forever . And that night Charlotte dreamed her own triangle . <p> It was immense , rising from the sands of a vast desert . When she approached , she discovered that it was actually a pyramid and so large that once she had walked around it she was terribly tired , hot and thirsty . She wondered if it had a door , so that she could enter and lie down in the shade . But looking closely , she saw that it was made of pieces of red meat , sewn together with thick black thread , and that the whole thing stank of rotten chicken offal . Suddenly the thread bloomed with blue flies , and the sound of their buzzing was deafening . <p> " Aunt ! Aunt ! " she cried , frightened . " What is it ? " But a voice that was not her aunt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Entering Fire ( Fire ) Lamprias de Bergerac Doubtless you are wondering what had precipitated my marriage with Virginie , when it is evident that I was made to wander alone , to follow intuition 's thin , glimmering thread where it would lead me . <p> We were introduced at a garden party . The women all fiddled with fans , and the men , their moustaches carefully waxed , stood about as stiffly as their own starched collars . In evanescent brocade , Virginie , a " bibi " of tulle and whalebone perched smartly on her head , was a wonderfully long-waisted girl with large , astonished eyes and thick , black eyebrows , close set , like centipedes about to copulate . Her lips , as they folded over a creamcake , were the colour of apricots and for one wet instant divulged her tongue . She sipped her tea and silently accepted another cake . Enchanted , I watched as it too disappeared into her mouth and down a throat noosed with pearls . <p> " Virginie ! " bellowed my mother , in taffeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only just returned from the turbulence of the Guianan jungle ! " And she backed off ostentatiously , leaving us alone . Virginie , her great blue irises ringed with darker indigo fixing a mysterious distance on the horizon just beyond my left ear , whispered dreamily , " The voyager . . . The voyager pursues his road , free and contented . He possesses nothing yet the entire world is at his feet . His eyes are ceaselessly struck by new objects which give him food for thought . Our life , do n't you think . . " and for the first time she looked into my eyes , " our life is a voyage . " <p> Head over heels in love I proposed to her within the week . My mother , delighted by the prospect of my domestication , gave the de Bergerac ancestral house over to wall-paperers , and retired to one of the family 's many country estates where she lived piously and in the company of harassed housemaids , and where she produced twenty-four night-bonnets and a linen altar cloth before passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon that I was forced to admit that my bride , for all her fetching ways with pastry , and despite the heavenly bliss of her eyes , had no soul . O ! The memory of that week in Hell ! Unable to bed her-for the sight of my naked body had shocked her into a froth of loathing-I attempted to talk to her . But my Virginie had no mind ; her conversation was only what she had managed to memorize from her exercise books . I remember the morning of my awakening . . . We were walking down a freshly raked path fragrant with jasmine . I commented upon the smell . <p> " Perfume , " said Virginie , " is agreeable to the nose . The shade , " she added , " is agreeable to those who walk . " I mentioned Darwin . <p> " Books , " said my wife interrupting me , " are agreeable to the wise . " Our path led to a tearoom . I suggested refreshment . When our cakes and coffee were served , Virginie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , said : " The most agreeable coffee comes from Arabia . " " Virginie , dearest . . . " I took her small , gloved hand in mine , " talk to me , dearheart . " <p> " I am talking ! Yes . . and that reminds me : The conversation of the ignorant is insipid , do n't you think ? " <p> I then asked her why she had consented to be my wife . Virginie tore a brioche in two and buttered it tenderly . " My mother bade me marry , " she explained , taking a bite , " and I did . " She brushed crumbs from her blouse . " Youth takes council from the aged . " <p> By the end of the week the marriage was still not consummated . At dinner I suggested an annulment . And there in the hotel dining room , surrounded by elderly couples in retirement , a baked custard quivering in its dish beneath her eager spoon , Virginie threw herself into a fit of shrieking , the first fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . <p> " If only , " said Virginie , once we returned home and her mother had convinced her that she was , like all mortal women , sexual , " if only people could reproduce photographically . " Even this bon mot was not her own , but belonged to Dr Roux , the eccentric inventor of the two-hundred-metre high battery , and then at the apex of fashion . <p> The week following our honeymoon , I left for China to study the Aerides odoratum and the Arundina , two particularly luscious specimens of orchids . I wanted to give my new bride time to accustom herself to the physical realities of marriage . Always an optimist , I imagined the slow awakening of desire , and passion 's blossom . I hoped Virginie would come to miss me . I flattered myself that once having entered her mind I would enter her body . I never even considered what was to be Kindergarten 's technique : to rub her neck , to rub her back , to massage her ribs and her buttocks , her thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again-for an hour , for two hours-until her body , as elastic and as yeasty as teacake batter , would be ready for what she called : The Sacrifice . Once and only once would this madwoman be mine and once was all she needed to conceive a Calamity And Dust ? Dust I had pulled from the fire , only to drop her into Virginie 's infernal frying pan . When I had found her sitting in the streets of Peking holding onto her little bleeding feet , banished by her mother-in-law for having stolen a peach , I chose to believe that Virginie , an obedient ( if unbedded ) wife and a devout Christian , would be pleased to adopt so needy , so self-effaced , so exotic a companion . <p> Dust was a dear , gentle thing and lovely when she smiled . I recognize that it was a blunder to get her pregnant . But so grateful was she for the kindness shown her , so anxious to please , that during our travels together she was forever posing herself in the most provocative postures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive manner imaginable . <p> It was impossible for me to concentrate on my work . My head was swimming with visions of this doll-like creature , her legs like sharpened pencils in the air , her jewelled mouth a ripe fig seeded with teeth . As I fell into her bed I imagined for a fleeting , foolish instant my ancestor 's dark , sprawling house transformed by two women living as sisters together , surrounded by an affectionate brood of children . And so , from foggy thinking fired by lust , I created a madhouse . I reflected upon all this beneath a canopy of blossoming cattleyas ; clusters of Brassavola fragrans , not visible to the eye , filled the air with savage sweetness . And I remembered that before setting himself down to his business of miracles , Savinien had needed to dispel the shadows that tempted his spirit and troubled his heart . He described his mood as one of Profound Melancholy . Reviewing my amorous history , myself heavy of heart , I felt closer to him than to any man I had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feared I was deluded , I feared I was , at best , a fool . From The Fountains of Neptune ( Water ) Christmas holidays had begun and I did not miss the schoolroom , nor my master whose name was Shelled ; rather , Shelled is what we called him . He had been shell-shocked during the Franco-Prussian War and he had never entirely recovered . A man of sixty , he appeared to us as someone archaic , even biblical ; there was something terrible about this moody man 's yellow face ravaged by tics . In his worst moments he threatened to hurl us through the window ; on better days he read us stories from Baudelaire 's translation of Edgar Allan Poe . I cherish a vivid recollection of Shelled sputtering The Gold Bug , one arm bent at a painfully acute angle across his loosely aproned back and the other holding the book within a hair 's breadth of his myopia . Further down the aisle one of the wilder boys had shat directly in his path . Shelled stepped neatly over it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one friend I had made in school . I admired Maximinole who was older than the other boys and who , unlike me , had " no time for stories . " Max was interested only in what he called " real things , " liberty and , of course , tormenting Shelled . Fossils in pavement , shadows in fog , the beached frames of unfinished boats prodding the air like the skeletons of whales , the moon hanging in the sky like an evil face were without interest . Planets , meteors , old stones , old shells , old sailors gibberish-what did they matter ? What did they prove ? Those starfish I went on about were dead things . Once in my zeal to win Max over I had bragged about a piece of rock I had found in the attic . Its one polished face offered a seascape perfect in every detail : grottoes , rising mist , cresting waves , reeling birds . Maximinole hotly insisted the thing was impossible , and in an excess of anger had punched me in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for him ; Max ran from the schoolyard and never returned . Later I learned that he-in that city of sailors-had apprenticed himself to a baker . Someone had seen the fiery Maximinole at dawn bent in two beneath a fifty-kilo sack of flour . Although he hurt me , I 've always felt that I pushed him too far , wanting him to see the world in a way he was unable to . I hate to think that this boy who had so brazenly lowered his drawers in the aisle was doing mule 's work for a baker . <p> Companionless , therefore , on that cold December morning on the edge of Christmas , I set off in the slush-for there was a drizzle to the day and the heavy snows of Saturday night and Sunday morning were sliding off the rooftops and into the gutters with a hiss . I sloshed down the street on the lookout for marbles ; I had found two favourites this way : an unusually heavy one made , I think , of hematite and a large one of transparent glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit I walked along with my eyes glued to the ground , my old wool beret pulled down over my ears making me look , I hoped , a little like a pirate . I also wore a pair of wool gloves cut off at the fingers . I did not find any marbles that day , but the sloppy water , oily in places and black , and the lumps of unmelted snow calving like icebergs in the miniature oceans of the street , had me continually dreaming . Such was the enchantment of those floating worlds that I lost all notion of place and time and wandered down to the port where the hulls of the season 's deserted sardiniers rocked in the icy water with a sorrowful , sucking sound . Their names were marvellous : The Free Thought , Hook 's Slave , La Communarde . Soon the wind sent me scurrying back to the protection of the streets where a thin mist followed me everywhere . The sun was already waning when , with a shiver of foreboding and delight , I recognized the side-street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant I saw the Ghost 's familiar fogged panes , its ancient stone doorsteps all puddled in the middle . <p> To the small boy I was , the Ghost inspired awe . I pushed the door open and entered on tiptoe . At first I could see nothing but the bottles twinkling like precious stones behind the bar : the hot ice of eau-de-vie , kirsch , and kummel , absinthe s green and bitter worm , a horrid toad-black beetroot alcohol , whisky , rum , and anisette , prunelle , a blushing peach brandy ; and syrups : mint and lemon , angelica .... It was still early for customers and the Cod 's wife was not standing in her usual place . The room smelled of roasting fishsurely the Cod 's dinner . I walked over to the chimp 's cage . Charlie Dee was fast asleep . His snoring made me think of walking on gravel at the bottom of a pool . Then my heart leapt , for I saw in the far corner of the room , smoke wheeling about his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearly opaque glass and bathed his features in alarming shadows . Now I wonder what demon compelled me to navigate the dusk and to sit down at his table . <p> The old sailor was pouring out two fingers of Terminus brand absinthe . With as much ceremony as a trembling hand would allow , he cradled a lump of sugar in a pierced spoon , balanced this over his glass , and poured in water . When the absinthe swelled to the colour of sea water , Toujours-La acknowledged me and greased his whistle . <p> The liquor in the Ghost was served in thick , hand-blown tumblers the like of which I 've not seen since . They were very old and the Cod had inherited a seemingly endless quantity of them when , no longer fit for seafaring , he had bought the place , handed his wife the brass key , and gone upstairs to give himself over to toothache , piles , and melancholia . The Ghost 's glass tumblers were so heavy , and the lip so sound and smooth , that they commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles in anger in that place , but no man had ever smashed a glass . <p> Toujours-La licked his lips , cleared his throat , and said : " I 've travelled the world over and I 've seen the Devil everywhere . But nowhere , Nini , nowhere , mind you , nowhere have I seen God . " He sucked his teeth , took a drink , and twitched . " Rose says- " I began . <p> " Do n't believe the crap you hear ! " he barked . " The universe and all its filthy planets were not created by God but by the Devil . Every morning the sun rises with an empty belly and at night she sinks bloated with blood . You 've seen how the moon circles the world like a clean bone ? " I nodded . " Like a skull licked clean of meat , " he insisted . <p> " Like the face of the Ogress ! " I whispered , fascinated by the gloomy colour of his words . Although I sensed that the mad steersman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining , already my own darkest waters were rushing out to meet his . <p> " War is brewing again , Nini ; I feel it biting at my bones . They said Bismarck was a hound-all men are hounds ! The Devil 's hounds ! And women are hornets . When was the last time you saw your mother ? " <p> I was stunned . Toujours-La , having momentarily emptied his gullet of bile , took up his pipe and for a time kept quiet . But I , at least within , was anything but quiet ; my blood was in a turmoil . I tried to remember when I had seen her and could not . It was like trying to see a midnight path in a starless , moonless air . But then , unknown to me , the quicksand of my thoughts shifted , and I changed the subject . <p> " Tell me a story ! " I breathed , curiously exalted as when once I 'd leaned too close to a cage of vipers a tattered man was showing for a centime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Toujours-La , " I rambled on as stiff in my chair as Pinnochio before he was made flesh , " tell me another one , about her-about the Ogress- " Just then the Cod 's wife came downstairs with a dish of baked tuna and pan-fried potatoes . <p> " So you 're here , Nini ! " She pecked at my cheek and striking a match lit a lamp . " Where 's Totor ? " " I do n't know-I 'm out alone ! Out exploring ! " " I 'll bring you a lemonade , " she said , " a hot lemonade with bitters . But no rum , Nini . Rose was in , mad as a cat-you 're not supposed to be here , son . " <p> " I 'm big enough to know where I should be ! " I said dramatically , and to prove it pulled off my wool cap and threw it down on the table-just one of the heroic gestures I 'd stolen from Maximinole . When she had gone Toujours-La said : <p> " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell her : This is my meat ! ' " He held his glass to the light . " You want some supper ? " The food looked good and I had been wandering since breakfast . He pulled the biggest folding knife I 'd ever seen from his pocket . The tuna 's flesh was so hot it hissed against the cold steel . " I once loved baked tuna . But they say a man 's a moulded river , little more than water . There 's something to be said for an entirely liquid ballast . " He knocked off another glass and with the ragged vocal cords of a rusty pall sang : <p> " My woman 's a bar lily <p> with a heart of flaming whisky <p> and the greenest eyes <p> and the meanest ways , yes <p> and the sweetest lies ... " <p> When the Cod 's wife was back with my lemonade and saw the empty dish pushed aside , she gave Toujours-La a kiss . " Good boy , " she said . <p> " Good boy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your grandpa-you silly cunt ! " <p> " You watch your language in front of the child ! " she bridled , hurt . <p> " I can hear anything ! " I cried bravely . " My brain 's solid copper ! " <p> " If the old sonofabitch was n't ready to croak , " she explained , " I 'd throw him out . Owes me plenty , too ! " She slammed back upstairs . <p> I felt something pulling at my leg ; it was Charlie Dee . He looked at me from under the table and grinned . I helped him up onto my lap where he immediately stuck his finger into my lemonade . Meanwhile Toujours-La knocked his pipe out against the heel of his shoe . The ash tumbled to the floor . He took a curious beaded pouch from his pocket and scrounged around for a few fragrant shivers of tobacco . Then he refilled his pipe lovingly . I thought : One day , like Totor and Toujours-La , I will carry a pipe . Hung before his face the mermaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked . She made the Ghost feel homey ; she was , after all , a toy hearth . Toujours-La poured himself another . This time he made a panache ; he mixed his absinthe with mint syrup and a spot of anisette . <p> " I was never a man , " he began , secreting the bottles on the floor beside his chair , " to carry dung in a pocket to exorcize misfortune .... One morning I woke up nowhere at all . <p> " I was young , still wet behind the ears , in fact , Nini , barely twice your age ; an apprentice ship 's carpenter on his first time out , shipping with the Greenland Company and eager for adventure . We was after whales in Baffin Bay and we 'd anchored off what 's now known as Thule-the furthest point off the North coast of Greenland a big ship can sail . The night before , I 'd sat myself down in the most peculiar bar you 'd ever hope to see-it squatted like a bitch taking a leak . The beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sod walls was carpeted with seal fur and the one window was the stretched bladder of a walrus . <p> " Outside they was those boreal constellations hanging so glassy they set my teeth on edge ; why , just looking at them was like chewing sand . There was something hideously timeless about the place , and the morning looked like evening and the other way ' round so you never knew what time it was or where you was , fore or aft , sleeping or waking . Hell , you had to think twice before sitting down else sit on your own face . <p> " The blue-eyed Eskimo who ran things had , by the smell of it , distilled the bile of seals ; too many hours before I 'd taken a swig and one-the orbs of my eyes had bled , two-my ear drums had burst , three-I could n't feel my legs from the knees down , four-I began to feel warmer than I 'd ever felt since relinquishing the womb ( maybe warmer ) , five-I 'd apparently begun to sing Offenbach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while my head orbited the room , and seven-I was out like a candle and under the table in the dimmest corner of a dark room , a room wherein everything was barely perceptible , lit by a couple of sputtering walrus-oil lamps . <p> " Despite the considerable rumpus I 'd made in the infancy of the evening , my mates and the polar proprietor had forgotten all about me . When I woke up I found that my granddaddy 's pocket-watch was gone , but I still had my pipe . " He sucked on it thoughtfully , curing the cleft between the mermaid 's breasts with a filthy nail . aI ran outta there like rats from a hull on fire , but the sea was as empty as an overturned coffin . <p> " I stood by the water , cursing-Devil take me ! ' I hollered , I 'm marooned I repeat , I was nowhere , Nini ; there was nothing in Thule , nothing but Eskimos and one crazy Dane trapper ( and he 's the one stole my watch for sure ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned cabaret tucked inside the ribcage of a leviathan , and the frozen heads of slaughtered reindeer marking the end of the street , their ears gnawed off by polar foxes which gave them an especial dismal appearance , and above all ice-ice , ice , ice-thousands of square feet of the stuff underfoot . I was standing on ice , Thule was anchored on ice-just thinking about it , even now , gives me vertigo . Water 's one thing ; ice another . I 'd rather wed a witch than be marooned on ice ! <p> " Devil take me ! ' I cried , ' I need a ship ! Any ship ! ' In that beggarly light I looked with despair on a horizon larded with ice ! " And then , Nini , I see her . I see : Bel . She materialized like an uncorked genie in the middle of downtown Thule , halfway between a pyramid of frozen walrus guts and the public shit-house . <p> " Hello , sailor , ' she mewed , you 're wanting a ship and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she purred , and she gave me a wink . <p> " You a ship 's captain ? ' I asked , flabbergasted . I 'd never dreamed a woman ship 's master , and the wench was beautiful-if peculiarly dressed in an obsolete velvet with sleeves like bellows . She was wearing lots of jewellery ; I particularly admired the wide choker of pearls . I took one sniff of her skin and the scattered pieces of my fractured skull came together . <p> " If you is a captain , ' I said , where 's your ship ? ' After all , I 'd peeled the horizon for the Soren Kierkegaard and seen nothing but the bung-hole of a whale . She laughed and her black eyes gazed towards the ocean <p> " I 'll be damned !

There was queens kicking the posteriors of valets and kings with the vish . . . the visages of maniacs copulating with mitred bears ; and preaching foxes and farting preachers-in short , a thousand devils and devilish devices , an encyclopaedic chaos wreathed with the names of rebellious spirits : Lucifer , Beelzebuth , and Astaroth ; and magical words such as ZAITUX and TROMADOR in a muddle of griffins-but all rendered with such foh ! felicity that though she could have looked ridiculous , in fact , the monstrous vessel commandedin her wild and gloomy way-respect .

The throat was thrown back in silent laughter , the teeth as big as casks of rum , the feral nostrils flaring , the orbits of the eyes like planets , the tangled mane of hair blazing with the phosphorescent algae that gave the ship the semblance of burning . The cleft of her bosom was so deep it could have held the bodies of three men ; her nipples were broad enough to straddle . " I laughed . <p> " Laugh , will you ! Little sprat ! Only listen !

On her forehead was inscribed a mysterious name : Great Babylon .... And I saw that she was drunk on blood . " " And was there blood in the cup ? " <p> " No , boy , sweet wine . One taste and a whirlpool is spinning in my mind and before nodding I am sleeping . I awaken in the belly of the Babylon in a hammock next to twelve others , all empty .

And now , ' she breathes , our toddy before tucking in ! ' Bel smiles at me and winks . To tell the truth , I think this winking 's vulgar for a captain ; then again I suppose a captain can never be a lady . <p> " Bel , it is clear by her attributes and attitudes , has been around . She is no white lily , but more your scarlet poppy , and her petals , lovely as they is , is mussed . Sounding my thoughts she gives me a slow , sideways glance which causes my stomach to sink . But then she 's handing me a fragrant cup . Inside I see a ring of imps cracking whips and leaping hoops of fire . " " Oh ! Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so pungent and delicious , I quaff it down and I 'm sent flying into the familiar whirlpool to the sound of trumpets and more prosaic the baaa baaa baaaing of a thoush-thousand sheep . I awake the next morning feeling unstrung and queer . But the smell of frying beefsteaks and fresh coffee has me and my mates leaping to our feet . <p> " Each day at breakfast Bel gives us our orders : retracing her chalk tetragrams ( and the Devil knows their purpose ) , and scraping the rust off these iron coffins she cherishes , their insides fitted out with sharp nails , and swabbing down the timbers of the ship , those huge , hot decks . But scrub with bucketfuls of elbow grease and good , brown soap , still a dreadful phosphorated mould is always growing back , coating everything in a luciferous sheen . Yet there is never much else to do as the Great Babylon sails herself , her canvas groaning day and night in an unceasing wind . We is going somewhere very fast , but in a haze so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hit ice , but Bel says she knows no finer helmsman than the Infinite and His wind . I figure that the Infinite of whom she speaks is no other than His Highness of Infinite Hell . In the mist I sometimes think I see His furies knotting the latitudes and longitudes that net the globe , tugging , and twisting , and dredging for our souls . <p> " Since I am a carpenter , Bel has me repair the Babylon 's ancient witcheries-those lewd emblems worried by the salt of time . Some of these-the griffins and the bears-is badly worn about the rumps and muzzles as if in their static race around the bulwarks they has been tearing one another to pieces . Some is lost their noses , some their teeth , others is featureless . Sculpture were never my line and the stuff the Babylon is made of is dreadful dense . I wonder how , despite the outlandish humidity , the wood is so hard and dry . An unworldly fire consumes the ship from within . <p> " Nights I dream the Babylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiger 's breath and tar , " Toujours-La continued , pouring out another panache , " but Bel likes me and shows it by cuffing my ear in this kittenish way she has . Once , young fool that I am , I grabs her and gives her a kiss . For this I get a scratch from my temple to my chin what do n't heal for weeks . She is a demon , no doubt ; keeps her pronged tail tucked beneath her petticoats . <p> " We all feel poorly . Some complains it is for lack of exsh . . . exsh . . . Oh ! Hang it !

" he shouted then for no apparent reason . " THAT MONKEY STINKS TO HELL ! " Startled , Charlie Dee tucked his head down under the table . " Speaking of in-fah ! - infested- I can see his lice from here ! SET HIM DOWN ! " <p> " He 's clean , " I said . " The Cod 's wife gives him a bubble bath each Saturday and rubs him down with lavender water . Totor told me . What happened then ? " <p> " Time . . . " he said , shivering , " time is speeding by unstoppable . Time 's a broom bewitched , straddled by a hag . Have we been given the Devil 's red shoes to dance our lives away ? Are we eating the Devil 's pudding ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We is ! " " SHUT YOUR TRAP ! " the sailor barked .

" he shouted savagely . " Set it back down on the floor or stick it in its cage . You want to hear the tale or fuss with animals ? " " But I am listening , Toujours-La , I am ! Charlie Dee 's not doing anything . Please . And then ? What happened then ? It 's the Ogress ! I know it is she ! Bel and the Ogress-one and the same ! " <p> " Yeah , " he said . Then , in a low snarl I did not like at all : " Yeah , Slyboots ! I could tell you another story ....

Listen if you want to know what hides beneath the tides , the shhh . . . swiftly ebbing tides of air you breathe . Prick your ears , my suckling ; I want to hear your ear-bones crack ! Listen sharply ! ARE YOU ALL EARS ? " This tirade ended when Toujours-La was seized by a painful spasm . When he took up the story again , his voice , thick and rumbling , was hardly recognizable . <p> " We is all growing weaker . Despite all that sleep and fancy fare we look like starvelings . All my mates is ulcerated at the throatthe punctures are deep and ugly . Did I say we was thirteen at table ? Thirteen counting Bel ? " " I do n't recall , Toujours-La . " <p> " You recall ! Little bugger ! Heed me ! I am dreaming . ... " He waited . I was angry and did not ask about his dream . He looked at me intently and , only after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black widow spiders what eat their mates , you know . Mantises do it , too . In the act . Eat the male 's head clean off in the act . You ever seen that , little bugger ? Ever seen the Act ? " " Toujours-La , " I whispered , my head swarming , I think I should go home . Rose- " <p> " THE STORY AI N'T OVER ! " He reached down and plucked a bottle from the shadows . " I consider throwing myself into the sea , but Bel , always so good at leeching onto my thoughts says : These waters are swarming with sharks . ' Now , if the thought of drowning is beginning to appeal to me , I have no desire to be eaten alive . It takes all the courage I have left to ask : What waters , ma'am ? Where are we ? ' <p> " Where is not your concern , ' she says . ' I hired you as ship 's carpenter , not as ship 's philosopher . How dare you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be . ' Throwing back her gorgeous head and exposing her long , white throat bound in its pearl bandage , she roars with laughter . Outside the wind swells and echoes her hilarity . <p> " One morning I awake slick with sweat , a shrill shriek , possibly my own , tearing through my ears . I 've been wrenched from a vivid nightmare of a winged and whiskered creature crouching heavy on my chest , its barbed proboscis boring into an artery , its thread-like tongue worming into my brain . The pain at my neck is esh . . . excruciating . Near mad , I see the others in a haze , sleeping still as Death , each one bleeding a thin , yellow blood at the neck . Despite my horror and my weakness , I know I must solve the riddle of Bel 's floating Babylon . " <p> " Did you ? Did you , Toujours-La ? " <p> " No ! Her griffins have kept their secrets , and if it was they what steered her , or Satan 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled his tumbler 's rim with his thumb . " I penetrate to the heart of her ; I explore the hull 's baleful maze . So tortured by fear and pain , I have to stop each step to hold my aching head in both my hands and weep . I find nothing ! Nothing in the main hold . Nothing in steerage . Nothing in the afterhold , or the captain 's store . She carries no cargo but these empty iron coffins and I am sorely baffled that with no ballast in a gale , which by the second doubles in velocity , the Babylon does n't rise into the air . <p> " I come at last to the galley-there is nothing there-not an onion , nor an apple pip ; nothing but a sinking feeling and , Heaven help me , a mangy cur , scaled and patchy , outlandishly filthy and seemingly exuding a noxious green sss . . smoke . He 's sleeping in the centre of a chalk circle I 've retraced myself . He opens one rheumy eye and , curling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I have no use for . When I see his shadow rising on the wall , I leap for a ladder and , pushing through the scuttle , find myself looking up into my captain 's cabin . " <p> I must have squeezed the chimp too tightly in my arms then , for he squirmed and , pulling away from my embrace , sprawled across the table and knocked over the sailor 's glass . Toujours-La gave Charlie Dee a slap which sent him sliding to the floor . He stood whimpering and stealing angry looks from behind his fists . Stunned , I mopped up the absinthe with my handkerchief . " I see , " he continued , pouring out another , " I see-hanging from the rafters in the dim glow of that evil ch. . chamber , hanging heavy and sodden from its feet , its wet muzzle glistening in the darkling air , an abomination-the creature of my dream . She is the offspring of a mantis and a bat , her teeth like prongs , her furry belly pendulous and swollen . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hi . . . hi . . . hideous , I would not have been so afraid ; it is the wedding of insect and mammal in the middle of the ocean what strikes me as particularly hidsh . . . hidsh . . . horrible .

And the blood she is drooling , child , is my own . " For emphasis , ToujoursLa jabbed at the air before my face with his pipe . Charlie Dee reached out and struck his thumb down its incandescent bowl . Grunting surprise and pain , he knocked the pipe to the floor where it shattered . <p> Toujours-La leapt from his chair and swept the chimp up by the ankles . He raised him high and sent him fracturing , head first , against the wall . With a sickening thud , Charlie Dee collapsed in a heap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fought for breath . Upstairs , the Cod lifted himself out of his tub . <p> " WHAT 'S GOING ON ? " he shouted . " WHAT 'S GOING ON DOWN THERE ? " The Cod 's wife pushed him back into the suds and pounded downstairs . Charlie Dee lay knotted in spasms . With a trembling hand , Toujours-La polished off his glass . <p> When the Cod 's wife screamed , I ran . I ran as fast as I could away from Toujours-La and the Ghost Port Bar . But the Ghost Port Bar and Toujours-La have always followed me . <p> After the murder of Charlie Dee , Toujours-La disappeared . " Good rubbish , " said Rose . " May he never be seen again ! " Two slow days passed before I returned to the Ghost with Totor for the monkey 's funeral . <p> From The Jade Cabinet ( Air ) <p> When I think of the Hungerk*nstler , I can not help but think of Angus Sphery 's study , that magical place where , little girls , Etheria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but recall with bitterness how , in order to appease the Hungerk*nstler 's appetites ( and so her temper ) our father sold all those precious artefacts that had so deeply informed our hearts and our imaginations . First the beetles went , then the penguin eggs , next the albino mole , then Dr. Johnson ( Father sold him to a French collector who also bought the Nigerian crocodile ) ; he sold the butterflies to buy the Hungerkunstler one dozen pairs of shoes , the Small Blues and Painted Ladies , the Great Peacock Moths and the Small Angel shades .... He sold his stuffed tanagers , his lyrebird , his Quetzal ; sold his six hawkbill tortoise shells , the pearl in the shape of a pig , the skull of a wistiti .... He sold everything , even the bottle of honey that had been procured from a hive built upon Thomas More 's tomb , and the beautiful egg of a dodo . ( " What , " Dodgson had mused with wistfulness upon making its acquaintance , " is emptier than the egg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , and what shows above all else the piteous colouration our father 's mind had taken : he sold the jade : the cane pommel once the pride of his youth ; the cicada from Tubbs 's cabinet and the chimera too ; sold the earrings he had given to our mother , Margaret Sphery , to celebrate Etheria 's birth ! <p> I tell all this so that you will appreciate the power the Hungerkunstler wielded over men ; her nefarious influence . When she left our father 's house for the New Age , its redundant footmen , bellpulls , and puddings , nothing remained in our father 's study but a few fossilized clams and a coconut . Even the books were gone . Had his own devastation been less terrible , I know I should have hated Angus Sphery ; as it was I could not . He was a ruined man , abandoned by the world . Having stung him to the quick and strung him up , the Hungerkunstler had sucked him dry . That winter he died a husk . <p> Alone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at taches on floor and ceiling . She seemed to have grasped that her husband had perished for she carried articles of his clothing about , knotted to the hems of her petticoats , or stuffed down the front of her dress . And if by nature forgiving , as I write this-I freely admit it-I am consumed with hatred for Tubbs and the Hungerkunstler for the manner in which they annihilated my family and squandered its treasures . <p> In Egypt the Hungerkunstler grew fat . She sat in the centre of her camel hair tent surrounded by dishes of honey and whey , devising methods to torment Tubbs-including the attempted seduction of Baconfield whose whole being , as we have seen , was taken up elsewhere . Both Radulph and the Hungerkunstler became weightier : she in body and he in mind . Tubbs darkened also : it was as if his centre had somehow imploded ; he absorbed light . In fact , he was as plagued by my sister 's absence as by the souvenir of the sound Feather 's body had made when it struck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very air that scorched his lungs , the terrible gravity that kept him earthbound . In his memoir Tubbs writes that in Egypt his sorrow contained him as a cage-as did his flesh . His flesh seemed an alien substance and yet it ruled him . He loathed the Hungerknstler , yet perpetually desired her . She led him by the horns , those same horns which in his dreams had been transformed into the double crown of Egypt and which burdened him like a dunce 's cap of solid lead . In a recurrent dream that plagued him throughout the month of March , Tubbs wore that dreadful crown and nothing else and the Hungerkunstler , a bloated , red spider , straddled his neck so tightly with her eight legs that he was barely able to breathe . Whipping him mercilessly with her cane , she precipitated him into a foaming maw of quicksand . <p> Tubbs always awoke screaming from this dream which he blamed on Baconfield , who had filled his mind with visions of tombs like gutted encyclopaedias submerged in sand . And more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been horned by the greed of thieves and the stealth of time . How unsafe the pharaoh 's sarcophagal house ! How treacherous a man 's vanity . Egypt was nothing more than one vast , pillaged jade cabinet ! " The Land of the Nile is a pudding , " Tubbs writes in his memoir , " truffled with the grisly artefacts of human pride , heaving with mummies tarred and bound , and yawning with funerary chambers . BOUNDLESS PAGANISM ! The mythical imagination is inescapable in Egypt , all pervasive : everywhere one turns one sees kings with the heads of lions , queens with the faces of crocodiles , hippopotamuses wearing dresses . Every article-obelisk , throne , and sphynx-is but a garish furniture which clutters death 's antechamber .... And everywhere pyramids pustulating like the blebs on a plague-ridden beggar ! " <p> It is a pity Tubbs was not an Egyptologist enamoured of the kings or even an enlightened collector , for he had an uncanny gift and could not walk two feet without kicking up an outsized alabaster thumb , a tauricornous amulet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the matted viscera of a princess , the paw of a sacred cat ) , or the wee clay figure of a king defaced by sorcery or neglect . The entire country , as far as Tubbs could see , was one heaving cemetery hideously jumbled by the dance of time . He often felt the whole world listing , tilting , and on sleepless nights imagined that not only was the world as flat as Baconfield argued , it was a dustbin filled to the brim with trash . Which explains his firm resolve to grind to a fine powder whatever he could , mummies and tumble-down temples alike , an attitude mirrored by the Hungerknstler . I explain : <p> The Hungerkunstler alarmed Baconfield ( who was skittish among women to start with ) ; more than once he had witnessed the fits of servants whom she had crazed with her incessant screeching and slaps . Inconvenienced by her hot advances , having oft , he hoped , with tact rejected her , and in an attempt to mollify her , Baconfield gave her a green peridot scarab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chest cavity of a priestess for three thousand years and which he had bought from a fell &h; in rags . The Hungerkunstler , who feared death and believed in magic , gave it to a servant who , before her eyes , reduced the precious thing to dust and fed it to her dissolved in wine sweetened with honey . So convinced was the Hungerkunstler of the amulet 's uncanny powers that she pressed Baconfield for others . As it turned out the fellah lived in a hovel which straddled a tomb ; it sufficed that he lift a stone from a hole in the floor to enter into the mastaba of a corpse which swarmed with priceless scarabs of opal , peridot , fayruz , onyx , and coraline . Some had the faces of rams , others of bulls , others had human faces . All of these were swallowed and digested by the Hungerkunstler . When a colossal scarabaeus sacer was uncovered by Baconfield himself as he rooted under his pyramid , he had it carried by four men to the Hungerkunstler 's tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tubbs who had ordered a second machine from Baconfield 's nephew , very much larger and more powerful than the first , its purpose to crush the limestone temples which littered the environ landscape . Tubbs , who hated disorder ( and so created it where'er he went ) , had all the temples he could seize-their columns in the lovely shapes of exotic plants , their carved friezes of undulating maidens-dismantled and transformed into chalk which was sent by barge downriver to the port of Boulak and sold to the masons of Cairo . Thus as a plague of locusts did Tubbs and his party descend upon Egypt . Had Tubbs a pudding-pan large enough , he should have steamed the whole country with currants and eaten it up with a runcible spoon . <p> From Phosphor in Dreamland ( Light ) <p> Dearest Ved-Having now read all of the poet 's vast opus , I can with certitude say this : When Phosphor made love to Extravaganza , the vortex of his cowardice , the gaping maw of his alarm vanished , and it was as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Extravaganza 's arms , his torment was melted down and reduced to a sweet honey that she extracted fearlessly . Her tender body gave itself utterly and unabashedly ; being simple and having no notion of evil , she was Edenic animal seized by heat . Her eyes and cunt wept with happiness ; her breasts filled the poet 's mouth like those magical fruits that are renewed as they are eaten . The feast was an eternal feast , or so it seemed , and the nights they spent together , all too swiftly done , somehow sprawled into infinity , abolishing not only terror but self and time . <p> Because it seemed to Extravaganza that , in her poet 's embrace , her body dissolved and reorganized into infinite series of animate and inanimate things-sea urchins and clamshell rattles , ivory clappers , ferns and fishskin drums-once she had surfaced from the oceans , lakes , burrows , nests , marshes , mud , sand pits , oyster-beds , and whirlpools of love , she battled bewilderment , unsure of where she was and , for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivering before her mirror , and slapping her sweet ass with her open palms , she would cry , as if surprised : " I am a human female ! " <p> The poet entered into a loving and living dream ; it claimed him , even when awake . All day long Phosphor was haunted by the nights , which , as the seasons progressed , hung strung together like amber beads on a golden wire . These he gnawed and worried in his mind . Dazzled by love , Phosphor 's cock and his heart had become one and the same animal . <p> These were blissful days and weeks-the most delightful of their lives . Phosphor , himself transformed , abandoned his epic-a pretentious and patriotic work-to devote himself to an inspired poetic revery on the nature of sensual love . Convinced that he had entered the secret chamber of an occulted mystery , he took it upon himself to reveal the prodigy to the vast world . His verse was a steaming milk , a wizard 's ink-and it rained upon the page , page after page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beside the open window combed her hair-which , free of ribbons , tumbled to her toesPhosphor described in amorous detail love 's multiplicitous vocabularies of salutations and smiling receptions , overturning the natural realm in order to ambush the metaphorical creatures that would do desire justice ; for example , the Gazelle ( or When the Beloved Attempts to Flee the Arrow ) , the Lion ( or Embracing , the Lovers are Encircled by an Invisible Yet Palpable Mane of Fire ) . And because he had not forgotten how a fish had unlocked his once solitary heart , Phosphor called his favorite embrace ( although hard-pressed to name a favorite , as in bed with Extravaganza each act of love precipitated and included all the others ) - that embrace during which the female , mounted from behind and knowing that the molten ring of her delight has moored her lover utterly , brings her thighs together as best she can , and the male , pushing his way in even deeper-as if that were possible-clutches his mistress ' breasts to further anchor himself-this position the poet called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chief librarian , Phosphor was given permission to contemplate-in the company of a Consultant to the Holy Office of the Inquisition-an ancient manuscript from India proposing entire zodiacs of love in the shapes of copulating animals and mythic beings : blue gods and mortal women , black and white ; red goddesses and mortal men , white and black . As the poet contemplated the book in a fever , the Consultant groaned and agitated his censer . In the fragrant mornings , the garden ablaze with butterflies , parrots rioting in the trees , Phosphor would return to work : <p> My beloved 's body is a delirious moon <p> A garden where foxes* paw and suck the grapes . <p> Her body is a vine plundered by foxes , <p> A tempest in a forest , a rain of black honey . <p> Her body is my darkness , total , luminous . <p> Her body is a rose of beaten gold ; <p> It burns against my heart . <p> Extravaganza was dreaming and nothing could stop her ; enchantment bubbled forth to inundate her soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lovers lay together until late , their tongues touching-and she would whisper the tumult of visions that , flooding the night , had submerged her . The poet listened to her eagerly , his cock throbbing between the buttocks of his beloved , his fingers lovingly investigating her wet fur . <p> Often , as she would describe some astonishing dream of thunderstorms and weirdly horned and pelted animals , or floating cities constructed of mother-of-pearl and brass , or harems wherein all the houris had the faces of ibises or tigresses , yet were in all their other parts human and sweetly formed , the poet would grasp his bride by the thighs and pull her to him . Compliant , already yielding , she would yield further , and for a time the telling of the dream would cease . Then , save for the sound of their breathing and the acute hammering of their blood , and the creaking and thudding of their windswept vessel , their chamber would fall silent . <p> Once , Extravaganza awoke wildly laughing . As she explained to Phosphor , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recognized the nose at once-it was her lover 's cock ; the apples of His cheeks , Phosphor 's balls . The Lord 's beard , hairs upon hairs , curls upon curls , and the place from which He spoke and breathed the breath of life was her own splendid cunt . <p> Footnote
