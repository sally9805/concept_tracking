Section : Business A scandal over racial slurs forces the oil giant to rethink  --  and remake  --  its corporate identity <p> LIKE SO MANY OTHER LAWSUITS , Roberts v. Texaco had sat quietly in the files of a federal courthouse , distinguished for neither the slowness of its progress nor the heat of its charges . According to the papers , the 20,000 men and women at Texaco Inc. were plodding along in a culture still strongly rooted in the commonplace bigotry of turn-of-the-century Texas oilfields . It was a place where a black employee could be called porch monkey ' or asked to caddy a golf game and where most women could only gaze up at a distant glass ceiling . Such claims of systematic bias were flatly denied by the company . And there the matter stood until late October , when a downsized Texaco executive , in an act of revenge or repentance , turned over tapes that caught company officials  --  including him  --  making racist remarks . By last week , Texaco had settled the case and was careering off on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as chairman Peter Bijur said , its very soul . ' <p> Michael Hausfeld , an attorney for the 1,400 plaintiffs in the class-action suit , called last week 's deal historic , ' and for once the label was accurate . Pending court approval , Texaco agreed to pay more than $115 million in racial reparations . The company will give about 1,000 black employees an 11 percent pay hike , spend millions more on programs designed to wipe out ' discrimination and let outsiders come inside to keep watch . Top executives toured Texaco plants and drilling platforms , apologizing for past insensitivity . And chairman Bijur , after long hours listening to the tapes and negotiating with the Rev. Jesse Jackson , told a colleague , I am a different man . ' <p> Changing a culture , whether in a nation or a company , is notoriously slow work . But if any corporation has reason to run a revolution , it 's this one . On the Monday before Election Day , The New York Times printed transcripts of a 1994 meeting of some top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing at black employees  --  and plotting to purge the s  --  t out of ' documents in the discrimination case . Within hours , the tapes were rolling on television and radio , and the country was getting an earful : one executive appeared to call blacks niggers . ' Another joked that black jelly beans were stuck to the bottom of the bag . ' A week later , Texaco 's independent investigator , having enhanced ' the tapes , reported that the word nigger ' never appeared , and that jelly bean ' was a reference , albeit twisted , to a metaphor used by a prominent diversity consultant . But the new transcript was hardly comforting . I 'm still struggling with Hanukkah , ' it quotes one of the executives , and now we have Kwanzaa ... Poor Saint Nicholas , they s  --  tted all over his beard . ' They go on to mock the symbols of Kwanzaa and the African-American anthem Lift Every Voice . ' <p> Texaco 's swift settlement capped two weeks during which chairman Bijur expressed his obvious outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taped meeting and withdrew benefits from the two retired men . It was a perfect case of crisis management '  --  nothing extraordinary , but the kind of fast ' fessing-up that would have been smart for Exxon in the Valdez case , or Mitsubishi with recent charges of sexual harassment . <p> Boycott : But this was actually the easy part . Jackson said Saturday that while he had called off picketing , a boycott was still possible . A federal grand jury is considering criminal charges of obstruction of justice . Meanwhile , Texaco faces 29 other discrimination suits , including nine about race and at least one charging anti-Semitism . The U.S. Labor Department is conducting three separate discrimination probes triggered by its own audits showing that Texaco may be failing to meet federal contractor standards . And last week two shareholder groups sued the company , angry that management let this problem fester . <p> Then there 's the work at hand : transforming a culture that is deeply entrenched  --  and now on the defensive  --  under what Bijur has called the agonizing glare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American version of a public stoning : one night last week , TV comedian Jay Leno labeled Texaco 's gasoline products regular , unleaded and supremacist . ' <p> By many accounts , Texaco was a disaster waiting to happen . Roberts v. Texaco , the class action filed in June 1994 , charged the company with persistent failure to hire , promote or even treat with decency its African-American staffers . It cited numbers : in 1994 only four of Texaco 's top 498 executives were black . And it included stunning affidavits of abuse and insult . A pregnant employee whose birthday cake was decorated with a rude caricature and watermelon seeds . Jimmy Porter , whose boss in Wilmington , Calif. , called him an orangutan , ' and was later named an exemplary employee , despite Porter 's complaint to headquarters . <p> Retaliation : Allegations that employees who joined the suit soon faced retaliation echoed a judge 's scathing 1992 decision in an age-discrimination case that had lasted 10 years . Ironically , a federal court jury had found that Texaco had not discriminated against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded her about $500,000 in damages and court costs because of Texaco 's willfulness ' and retaliation against Malarkey . The U.S. district court judge , Michael B. Mukasey , a former corporate counsel and a Reagan appointee , charged Texaco with dilatory , scorched earth ' tactics ' designed to scare off any employee who might seek redress . Upheld by higher courts , the case is still under appeal by Texaco . <p> Why all this at Texaco ? The oil industry , and Texaco in particular , has long had a reputation for arrogance . Refining and drilling for oil do n't require much consumer research . Unlike a Procter &; Gamble or an Avon , which began to tackles such issues years ago , Texaco is in an insulated industry , ' says its diversity chief , Edward Gadsden . Gadsden , hired in 1994 , is running Texaco 's first diversity programs , just as other companies are discovering just how inadequate most of those programs are . Meanwhile , Texaco has had its hands full of the kind of things that prompt many companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1987 , after losing a vicious court battle with Pennzoil over its purchase of Getty Oil , Texaco declared bankruptcy and was able to cut a record-breaking $10 billion judgment down to a $3 billion settlement . It then spent years fighting raider Carl Icahn , paying off debt and shedding operations and employees . Chairman Bijur , who became CEO in July , seemed to be inheriting a company that was cleaned up and ready to roll . Analysts praised his deft moves , including a pending alliance with Shell Oil . <p> His problems now are different , and it is little comfort that no one believes Texaco is the only offender in the land . But if Texaco reflects a society torn over race , Bijur is typical of many individuals who struggle with it . He is clearly disgusted , embarrassed  --  and determined . But he was also defensive . In an interview , he pointed to his colorblind ' record and argued that he 'd just been running businesses ' where such things as discrimination did n't cross his radar screen . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even the Malarkey case , in which he had been called to testify that he or his staff had been involved in any corporate retaliation . <p> Bijur has lots of room to make his mark . Despite a pledge to double contracts with minority businesses this year , Texaco is having trouble keeping up with its 1995 results . Last week Bijur named a new committee , headed by board member and NYU president emeritus John Brademas , to examine the diversity issue . But Brademas already heads a public responsibility ' committee on the board , charged with just such oversight . With a new mandate , maybe this time he 'll have the management clout to make changes . But it 's Bijur who 's got the big job , and he knows it . I 'm not naive , ' he says . I live in this country .
