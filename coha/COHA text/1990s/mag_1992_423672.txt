<p> Imagine , three years from now , your " smart " TV is hooked to a high-capacity fiber-optic network . If you wish , you can dial up a month 's worth of movies-selected and catalogued according to your tastes by your TV set from the 50,000 movies made since the creation of Western cinema-and " download " them in a five-minute transmission burst . A meter in your set will bill you only for items you decide to descramble . And charges will be much less than current video-store fees . <p> Or , you might choose to review the day 's news : flick on Peter Jennings and , if an item he mentions interests you , ask your set for more information . It , then , will show you film footage and reporting that today 's news networks leave on the cutting room floor . As George Gilder describes in the following article , these features and more are part of the promise to consumers from the emerging information revolution , which is riding developments in fiber optics , microchips , and digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube era . <p> Although these developments appear to be inevitable , what 's slowing their inception is a network of government regulations that keep the industries best positioned to develop the technologies from entering a vast consumer market . Even in the guise of consumer protection , regulations of this nature , this article makes clear , serve to inhibit the promise of technology , not promote it .  --  Ed . <p> By all measures , TV was a superb technology for its time . Indeed , its presence and properties defined the time . But now its time is over . The television age is giving way to the much richer , interactive technologies of the computer age . <p> The overthrow of television was already assured at the moment of its initial triumph . Television is a broadcast medium shaped by the characteristics of the vacuum tube and the radio-frequency spectrum . As these technologies were beset by more powerful rivals , the future of television fell into jeopardy . <p> The nature of both the vacuum tube and the radio-frequency spectrum shaped the powers and limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These technologies dictated that television would be a top-down system-in electronic terms , a " master-slave " architecture . A few broadcast centers would originate programs for millions of passive receivers , or " dumb terminals . " <p> The expense and complexity of the tubes used in television systems meant that most of the processing of signals would have to be done at the station . The TV had to be relatively simple , because designers had to keep costs down by using the lowest possible number of vacuum tubes in the sets . Storage of signals was out of the question , since a memory might require millions of vacuum tubes in a single set . <p> Economic and technical constraints pushed the critical electronics out of the TV set and back into the broadcasting station . Nearly all of the system 's intelligence-shaping , sequencing , and storing picture signals-would have to be located at the broadcasting center . <p> The television set was the bottleneck . Its processing power would limit the form of the signals used , the resolution of the picture , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandwidth-was minute compared with the processing power at the station . <p> Yet television easily triumphed over its technical flaws , and the world came to see it as a fact of life . TV was " the air . " Several inventions , however , ultimately dislodged the key props of the television age . The invention of the transistor in 1948 , the microchip in 1958 , and the fiber-optic cable in the late 1970s made the top-down broadcast structure , with most of the intelligence at the station , obsolete . <p> Microchips served initially as cheap substitutes for the vacuum tube . As the years passed , however , the microchip industry spawned an unending series of innovations that would doom all top-down broadcasting systems . With millions-yes , millions-of vacuum-tube equivalents printed on single slivers of silicon costing less than one dollar to make , cheap video receivers in the 1990s would no longer have to be dumb or dependent on distant stations for processing power . <p> Far from a stripped-down box with nothing in it but a few vacuum tubes and copper wires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processor with millions or even billions of tube equivalents that could perform functions well beyond mere display . It could create , perfect , process , store , and even transmit signals on its own . Although microchips first were used to extend the life of ordinary receivers and videocassette recorders , eventually they would radically change the very nature of the medium . <p> Intelligence could move from the broadcast station into inexpensive home-based personal computers ( PCs ) . The PC would eventually be able to manipulate video signals at the user 's will , zooming in and out , performing replays , storing and even editing pictures . This video-processing power at the set would greatly reduce the need for complex and costly equipment at the event to be broadcast or at the broadcast station . A concert or sports event could be taped , for example , with just four video cameras , and then transmitted to give the viewer a 360-degree image that he could shape at the PC . The choices now made by broadcasters at the event could be made at home by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microchip technology was well timed , because even the air began to give out . With the rapid spread of mobile technologies led by the nearly ubiquitous cellular phones , the air became a valuable and limited resource . Hewlett-Packard 's $600 hand-held computer with full IBM DOS capabilities and connections to satellite paging systems foreshadowed the day when cellular phones would become portable computers . As mobile as a watch and personal as a wallet and coming from firms as diverse as General Magic and General Motors , mobile communications would fill the air with mail and messages . The Motorola-Timex wristwatch pager , which displays the number and identity of the caller , portends an ultimate vision of the wristwatch telephone , with everyone using spectrum for personal communication . <p> TV broadcasters have been the world 's biggest air hogs . With no alternative technology in sight and few competing uses for the air , however , television has not until now had to justify its immense demands for spectrum . But in the 1980s , just as the microchip had transformed the dimensions of electronics , fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air , and even of the coaxial copper wires that carry cable television , gave way to the unlimited bandwidth of lasers and glass . Fiber-optic glass wires the width of a human hair could potentially bear billions or even trillions of characters of information per second . <p> Like all technologies superseded by more powerful inventions , television would not readily disappear . The corpse would linger in American living rooms for many more years . But the fate of technologies is defined not by their prevalence but by their competitiveness and promise . By that measure , the mostly analog " idiot box " and videocassette tape player would be as passe as last century 's icebox and ice wagon . More Versatile Systems <p> The new system will be the telecomputer , a personal computer adapted for video processing and connected by fiber-optic threads to other telecomputers all around the world . Using a two-way system of signals as telephones do , rather than broadcasting one-way like TV , the telecomputer will surpass the television in video communication just as the telephone surpassed the telegraph in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and speed of advance , this new system promises far more than television did in 1950 . Computer technology , dominated by the microchip , approximately doubles in power every year . As its power rises , its price declines and its market increases . Within a span of about seven years , any computer function will drop to one-tenth of the current cost or grow 10 times in power . Largely because of price reductions , the number of personal computers in offices rose more than tenfold in just the six years from 1981 to 1987 . Use in homes rose more than twenty-fold . Some 40 million personal computers  --  half the world 's total number of PCs  --  now reside in U.S. worksites and homes . <p> In presenting one-way news and entertainment , telecomputers can already do anything that present-day televisions can do . But they will soon offer a plethora of new computer functions . Telecomputers have interactive powers , from voice-controlled video to image creation and retrieval , that are inherently impossible in an analog broadcast medium . <p> The telecomputer 's impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as potent as the impact of television has been . But the telecomputer 's influence will be radically different . The telecomputer may even reverse the effects of the television age . <p> Rather than exalting mass culture , the telecomputer will enhance individualism . Rather than cultivating passivity , the telecomputer will promote creativity . Instead of master-slave architecture , the telecomputer will have an interactive architecture in which every receiver can function as a processor and transmitter of video images and other information . <p> No information company will be exempt from this sweep of industrial transformation . Except for a few special applications , sending voice signals alone through wires or pictures through the air simply will not pay . The air will provide sufficient bandwidth for voice communication over wireless phones or the radio . The air is a hopeless bottleneck , however , for the huge bandwidth needed to transmit images in a world with as many transmitters as receivers . <p> As time passes , this bottleneck will become more and more obvious . The spread of mobile-phone technologies will create powerful new competition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of computer video will create an ever-growing demand for ways to distribute video programming . The current limitations of the spectrum , combined with new technology , will dictate a reversal in the proportionate use of wire and air for audio and video . This is the essence of the " telefuture . " As Nicholas Negroponte of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's ( MIT ) Media Lab has long prophesied , voice communication , now conducted through wires , will be carried over the air . Entertainment data , now broadcast over the air , will be transmitted through fiber-optic wires . <p> Because government regulations deter the Baby Bells from investing in telecommunications , they long diverted their capital into real estate and financial services . As regulatory controls are amended in the future , however , the Bells will have to put every available dollar into preparing their networks for the telefuture . Similarly , the cable industry , beset on one side by the power of fiber and on the other by the growing efficiency of direct-broadcast satellite , can prosper only by exploiting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the home and by linking it to two-way fiber networks . <p> Many American executives throw up their hands in despair over the price of a fiber system . Experts estimate that installing an entirely glass phone network would cost between $100 billion and $300 billion . Additional billions would be needed to build high-definition telecomputer screens and new video memories . Where will the money come from ? Most electronics-industry lobbyists agree on a solution . The way to finance the wiring of the United States , they say , is through massive government subsidies and guarantees . But as White House budget officials plaintively point out , there are hundreds of other worthy seekers of such funds , from AIDS researchers and bioengineers to high-energy physicists and space scientists . <p> Fiber must be financed not through the government but through the U.S. computer , cable , and telephone industries , which will reap the rewards from this vast commercial undertaking . One obvious source for the funds in the Baby Bells . In 1990 , the Bells boasted revenues of almost $80 billion and earned profits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace of about 5% a year for the last six years , mostly from phone service alone . Any accelerated program for fiber to the home , though , would have to include entertainment video to make it pay . The U.S cable operators could participate ; they command a cash flow of some $17 billion a year . Under deregulation , other possible contributors to the network would include the long-distance carriers , from AT &T; to GTE ; the electric utilities that string glass wires within their electric cables ; and other companies that want to share in the technology . <p> American industry , released from its regulatory shackles , could finance a program of fiber to the home without any government aid . <p> Most U.S. business and political leaders , however , are ignoring this possibility . They see the struggle for the telefuture as a contest between the United States and Japan in the consumer-electronics market . They focus on television even though the U.S. commands the computer industry , which uses the most rapidly-advancing technology in the history of mankind . Japanese TV manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim for step-by-step conversion of their outmoded box into a powerful computer . They know that the country that can first converge the worlds of information and entertainment will become the global computer and telecommunications leader . The Promise of Digital <p> While executives in major American electronics firms concentrate on all the reasons a telecomputer strategy will fail , however , entrepreneurs in literally thousands of other U.S. companies are showing how it will succeed . <p> In preparing for the telefuture , the computer industry is moving to become a central player not only in the huge domain of " television " video but also in telephone , mail , films , and publishing . Driving the change is the steady shift from analog to digital signals in all media , from phones to newspapers . <p> Hostile to editing and manipulation , every analog signal is different from every other . Using them , the Japanese have created an array of ingenious devices , including the advanced TV , the VCR , the laser disk , the Walkman , the camcorder , and the Nintendo gamebox that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , communicates with the TV only by simulating a television station and can not communicate with the laser disk , the game machine , the satellite dish , or the telephone without complex converters . <p> Digital signals , on the other hand , are all homogeneous bits and bytes , on-off codes that can be easily , stored , compressed , error-corrected , edited , and manipulated . Rather than incompatible , single-purpose functions , digital signals foster the rich interactive and relatively open world of the personal computer . In digital TV , for example , the station sends not a picture but information about the picture ; the image is formed , controlled , and stored not at the station but in the telecomputer itself . The distributed intelligence of digital systems is appropriate for a world with as many transmitters as receivers . Each computer becomes a potential video station . <p> Most of the world 's bureaucrats in charge of the future of television-from Japan 's MITI to Europe 's Eureka project-still believe that the most important coming advance in TV is higher resolution images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this changeover to all digital telecomputers . <p> Digital video will allow viewers to escape the constraints of time ( through storing programs in memory ) , to transcend the bounds of space ( by allowing viewers anywhere to tap into any station or newspaper ) , to overcome the limits of bandwidth ( by compressing the images and sending them in " burst mode " ) , to surmount the regimen of rigid standards ( by converting the content to homogeneous digital code ) , and to eschew pre-formed structures and vantage points ( by making images modifiable at the receiver ) . Rather than predetermining the resolution and order of broadcast , digital allows scalable resolution and manipulable content , all extensible into the future as new technologies emerge . This advance is incomparably more important than a fivefold increase in picture definition . <p> If the picture is to be projected onto a flatpanel wall display , it should command wider bandwidth and resolution than if it is a portable TV being used on a bed . If it is displaying a sports event , it will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is showing a travelogue . If it is an interactive medical diagnosis , it will require two-way communication and high-resolution stills of symptoms . If it is a newspaper , combining text with moving or still images , it will need more controllability ( for browsing , branching , and archival search ) than if it is a film . The crux of a successful digital video standard is not some specifically defined " best possible picture " but a data structure that permits the intelligent receiver  --  the telecomputer  --  to identify and signal and process it in the appropriate way . <p> All these dreams of digital video processing computers now depend on image compression , transforming the gigantic " bitmaps " of digital images and reducing them to a size that can fit on . a disk or flow down a wire . Although fiber optic lines can carry nearly unlimited amounts of uncompressed video , most computers ( and TVs ) are bandwidth and storage limited . Just a few minutes ' worth of raw digital video would swamp a large hard disk or even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1990s , therefore , compression will be the key to digital video . Even if images can be transmitted by fiber , without compression they can not be stored in a computer at a reasonable cost . But in the early 1990s , just in time for the digital dawn , there has erupted a laboratory riot of compression technology . Choices Ahead <p> The United States is increasingly well prepared for the computer age . The Census Bureau reports that by October 1989 , among children between 3 and 17 , 46% used a computer either at home or at school . Some 28% of the adult population or over 50 million Americans use computers at home or at work ; some 76 million Americans are occasional computer users . Computers are not an alien , high-end product ; they are now the most common technologies in America . And they are particularly American . Per capita , the United States has three times the computer power of Japan or Europe . Today the United States faces a supreme opportunity to exploit its lead in computers by establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast to the couch-potato TV , the computer builds on the most significant achievement of the new generations of American youth : the creation of a computer culture that has given the United States world leadership in this paramount industry of the information era . Throughout the decade of the 1980s the number of computer scientists in America grew at a pace of 43% per year . This upsurge is a major U.S. resource that should not be abandoned . <p> The real choice today is between personal computing and consumer electronics : between on the one hand , open interactive systems that summon the creativity of scores of thousands of software engineers and makers of peripheral devices , and on the other hand , proprietary systems in which all the intelligence is supplied at the factory . The alternative to a computer-compatible standard is a continuation of lowest common denominator TV broadcasting , with a relatively small number of channels , and a TV industry that threatens the future of home computing rather than fulfilling it . <p> Working in conjunction with cable companies , satellite systems may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized audiences across the country into lucrative targets for narrowcast programming and advertising , including programs of adult education , specialized business news , hobbies , sports , and technologies . <p> In the long term , however , the full flowering of the telecomputer still depends on fiber-optic networks , ultimately reaching into the home . Fiber optics technology has been sweeping down a learning curve even faster than the curve for microelectronics . Among several companies aggressively pursuing the technology , Broadband Technologies of Raleigh , North Carolina , has introduced an array of cheap silicon technologies for delivering digital HDTV to homes on fiber at the cost of current cable and is testing them with several Baby Bells . <p> A digitally switched fiber optic network , now practical for the first time , could break the world of video wide open . Satellite and compression technology will come on first with hundreds of channels . Switched fiber optics and computers offer the potential of as many channels as there are terminals on the network . With video connections as convenient as the telephone today , teleconferencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for corporations into the consumer domain . <p> Andrew Lippman of the Media Lab offered a prophecy in pithy terms . In " An Action Memo to Representative Edward Markey , " he wrote : " Forget television sets . In three years there wo n't be any . Instead , there will be computers with high-quality display screens . Inside these computers , there will be digital instructions allowing them to receive ABC , NBC , HBO , BBC , and anything we can dream up . " Lippman jibes that the Europeans and Japanese are launching " TV for the blind , " since both regions are doggedly moving to transmit analog HDTV at a time when there will be no affordable displays to show it on and no suitable programming . <p> No matter how well digital electronics goes in the United States , however , it is always a mistake to sell Japan short . The United States will waste all the heroics of the digital pioneers if the U.S. computer industry does not focus on the issue of television . <p> In the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in television to help gain the time and technology that would eventually allow them to take the lead in the computer industry . By extending the life of analog television into the next century with HDTV , the Japanese hope to thwart the age of the telecomputer until they can rule it . The American establishment should not allow itself to be sidetracked by this Japanese strategy . All the fiefdoms of the television age must give way to the new imperative of the computer age : the creation of a national , integrated-services , digital network of fiber optics . Launching an era of true telecomputing , this technology would not only make the United States a major force in consumer electronics but would also help the nation address its critical problems of culture and education . Key to the Future <p> The key to advancing this technology is the creation of a sound industrial policy , one that focuses not on regulations that promote U.S. television production but on the removal of government obstacles to the rapid deployment of fiber optics . <p> Four measures will be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video  --  a crucial step toward paying for fiber to the home : The Federal Communications Commission must follow up aggressively on its measure to remove the 1970 restrictions on cross-ownership of cable and telephone lines so that the phone companies can transmit video entertainment throughout their own regions . Judge Harold Green must continue to relax the restrictions in his Modified Final Judgment so that the phone companies can enter information-based businesses , including transmission of TV programs without fear of litigation . Congress must revise the 1984 Cable Communications Policy Act to end the entertainment-video cable monopolies and move to allow cable companies to supply phone and data communications services . Congress must also restrict the powers of state public-utilities commissions to regulate Bell investments and depreciation rules . All of these measures must add up to a resolute decision to deregulate American telecommunications . Unlike the drive for HDTV , a campaign to promote fiber optics would be simple and practical . It would be a sure winner . It would use U.S. technology , U.S. workers , and U.S. corporations . By creating a new network of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American information economy and regain their central role in telecommunications . Cable companies could break out of their role as a government-protected monopoly and become a pioneering participant in the cornucopian businesses of the information age . <p> By George Gilder <p> <p> Mr. Gilder , a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute in Seattle , Washington , is the author of a number of books on entrepreneurship and on computers , including the forthcoming Telecosm . <p> <p> Excerpted from Life After Television by George Gilder . <p>
