// Michelle hung up the phone and frowned When was her mom going to start treating her like a grown-up ? Sure the weather was bad ; you could look out the window and see that . But was that any reason to make a special call just because they were having trouble on the way home ? Michelle 's mom had gone to pick up her father at the airport . Michelle had told her that everything would be fine . Her brother Scott was over at Randy 's , and Michelle could make her own supper . Still her mom had worried . The weather report was calling for more storms . " Well , " Michelle said , " there 's no point in wasting this rare opportunity for privacy . " She yanked out enough food to make a triple-decker sandwich . It was a treat to be able to eat the kind of meal she wanted for a change . A few minutes later Michelle was perched in front of the television with her supper . She shuddered as the title flashed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set was interrupted by the ringing telephone . " Hi , Michelle . You watching the movie ? " It was Michelle 's friend Angela . " Yeah , " Michelle said . She told Angela she was home alone . " Wow , " said Angela . " That 's not the kind of movie I 'd want to watch alone . " " Well , I 'm going to , " said Michelle . " Bet you turn it off before it 's half over , " Angela teased . " Nope . I 'm going to watch the whole thing , " she said and hung up . Michelle wrapped the striped afghan around her , mummy-style , and snuggled at one end of the sofa . After a while the movie began to get scary . She wanted to switch channels , but Angela would never let her forget it if she did . The telephone rang again . Probably Angela checking to see if I 'm still watching , Michelle thought . " Hello ... Hello . " There was no answer . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . Outside the wind howled . Michelle tugged the afghan tight around her . The movie just got scarier . When the phone rang again , Michelle jumped and scattered potato chips all over the carpet . " Hello ? " she answered , this time hoping it would be her mother calling to check on her . But the breathing started again . Michelle slammed down the receiver . Somebody was trying to frighten her-and they were doing a good job ! When the wind clattered a trash can across the driveway , Michelle suddenly thought about the doors . It was a house rule that the doors had to be locked when her parents were n't home . Were they locked ? She crept carefully around and checked . On the television , something terrible was about to happen . A woman , wide-eyed with terror , clutched the collar of her bathrobe as she listened to the thud of heavy footsteps on the stairs . The phone rang again and Michelle jumped . She snatched up the phone , sure this time it must be her mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Movie getting to you ? " Angela giggled . " You OK ? You sound kind of weird ! " " I 'm fine . " Michelle breathed a sigh of relief . " Is the storm bothering you ? " Angela asked . " No . What about you ? " Michelle asked , wanting to keep Angela on the phone as long as possible . " Nah , " Angela said . " Got to go . The movie 's back on . " Michelle stood still , the dial tone buzzing in her ear . Suddenly the buzzing stopped . The phone was silent . Michelle pressed the button several times . Nothing ! A fierce blast of wind shook the house . The lights flickered . Michelle dashed toward the stairs . There was a flashlight in the hall closet . Halfway up the stairs , the lights dimmed and went out . Darkness closed around her like a thick , suffocating blanket . Michelle groped her way up the steps and , after stubbing her toe , found the flashlight . The shrieking wind splattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool of the flashlight beam to her room . Her hands shook as she closed the ruffled curtains . A sudden flash of lightning illuminated a figure in the driveway below . Michelle 's clenched fist flew to her mouth to stifle the scream she felt rising in her throat . As she watched , it seemed that her feet grew roots . Someone was opening her dad 's tool shed . His long , black coat flapped in the wind like a flag . Michelle shivered . It seemed her heart had stopped beating . Terrified , she sank onto the bed , fighting panic . Something thudded heavily against the back door . Michelle stiffened . He was trying to get into the house . She had to call the police . But the phone did n't work . She was trapped ! Suddenly car headlights flashed on the wall above her head . Mom and Dad were home just in time ! Michelle listened for the rattle of keys in the lock before she dared move . Her mother 's voice rang through the house . " Michelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " Before Michelle could answer , the lights came back on , flooding the house with cheery brightness . Photograph // " I 'm fine , Mom , " Michelle called , faking confidence . " I just had to find the flashlight . " Then she remembered the figure in the driveway and hurried downstairs to warn her parents . She was almost to the kitchen before she heard conversation between her dad and someone else . " ... Anyway , I came to borrow your ladder . Hope you do n't mind . The wind put a limb through a window . " As Michelle entered the kitchen she recognized Mr. Marshall , Randy 's father , standing there in a long , black raincoat . " There 's Michelle , " her mother said , smiling at her . " I 'm surprised you were n't afraid in such a terrible storm . " Michelle frowned . " I told you . I 'm grown up now . I can handle things like storms and .... " She wanted to tell them about the phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , Sis . Were you scared in the storm with all the lights off ? " asked Scott as he burst into the kitchen . " Of course not ! " Michelle glared at her little brother . " Did you get any funny phone calls ? " he asked with an impish grin . He looked at Michelle and panted noisily . " Scott Preston ! You creep ! " Michelle shouted . " It was you ? " " What phone calls ? " her dad asked . " It was all Randy 's idea , " Scott said . " Michelle always acts so big , we thought we 'd give her a scare . " Scott looked from one solemn face to another . " Aw , ca n't anybody take a joke ? " " Trying to frighten your sister is no joke , Scott . In fact , it was a childish thing to do , " Mom said sternly . " Perhaps the idea of doing Michelle 's chores for a week will give you a little scare . " Scott scowled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what he deserved . When you act like a child-you get treated like one ! Photograph // <p>
