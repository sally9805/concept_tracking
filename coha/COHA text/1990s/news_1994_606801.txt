<p> Perpetual motion is standard operating procedure for Major F. Riddick Jr. , the budgetary whiz who is emerging as the most powerful bureaucrat in the embryonic administration of Gov. - elect Parris N. Glendening . <p> Last week on Monday , he was in Upper Marlboro , presiding over the first Cabinet meeting for his old friend Wayne K. Curry , the new Prince George 's county executive . On Tuesday , he zipped to Annapolis to brief the president of the Maryland Senate on Glendening 's transition plans . On Wednesday , he helped Glendening prepare for an anti-crime initiative in Baltimore . The next day , he met with aides to outgoing Gov . William Donald Schaefer before dashing to Norfolk on Friday for his mother 's retirement ceremony . <p> " There are an awful lot of things on my plate , " acknowledged the fast-talking , fast-moving Riddick , 44 , who somehow does n't sound immodest when he adds : " I can handle a lot . " <p> Glendening apparently agrees , because he has asked Riddick to manage the daily affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 18 , according to associates of both men . <p> The official announcement of Riddick 's new job was planned for today . Sources in the Glendening camp said Riddick 's role is likely to be similar to that of a corporate chief operating officer : He will directly oversee individual state agencies and departments , leaving Glendening free to set broad policy and sell his programs to the public and the General Assembly . <p> The arrangement would be a reprise of the roles the two played for the last four years in Prince George 's , where Glendening served as county executive and Riddick as his chief administrative officer . But it would be a sharp departure from the Schaefer model , in which the governor interacted more directly with his Cabinet secretaries , with no subordinate playing such a powerful managerial role . <p> Glendening 's advisers hope the new structure will result in a more efficient , disciplined government better positioned to deliver on the new governor 's goals of improving public education , making streets safer and generating jobs . <p> The danger , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and responsibility in one individual . Some of Glendening 's aides are nervous that he is relying too heavily on Riddick and foreclosing other avenues of advice . One occasional adviser said the energetic number two man has " spread himself too thin . " <p> But Glendening has enormous confidence in Riddick , stemming in part from his sense that Riddick kept the Prince George 's ship of state floating smoothly while he campaigned for governor for the last two years . In a recent interview , Glendening lauded not only Riddick 's administrative skills and knowledge of government but also his ability to spot " red flags " that might do political damage to Glendening . <p> Glendening said Riddick temporarily delayed the planned rebidding of the multimillion-dollar computer service contract for the county government until after this year 's election . The contract is held by Maxima Corp. , which is headed by a major Glendening campaign supporter , and Riddick thought that whatever the outcome of the competition , Glendening would leave himself open to charges of political favoritism . <p> " I consider him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be a person who keeps my well-being and my family 's well-being in the highest regard . " <p> Glendening and Riddick met more than 16 years ago when Glendening was on the Prince George 's County Council . Riddick , a native of Chesapeake , Va. , with undergraduate and graduate degrees from Virginia Polytechnic Institute , had just taken a job as a budget analyst with the Prince George 's government . <p> Riddick was part of a small cadre of activist blacks who were beginning to rise in what was then a predominantly white county government and political establishment . One of Riddick 's first friends in the county was Curry , then a young government bureaucrat . Riddick said he remembers giving informal dinner parties that included Curry and future Democratic representative Albert R. Wynn , who at the time was the executive director of the county 's consumer protection agency . <p> Howard P. Stone , another member of that circle and now Curry 's chief of staff , said Riddick was the technocrat of the group . <p> " Major was much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget , while the rest of us dabbled in politics , " Stone said . <p> As Glendening rose up the political ladder , Riddick went with him . After Glendening was elected county executive in 1982 , he tapped the 32-year-old manager to head the county 's housing department and four years later named him budget director . In 1990 , Riddick reached what was then the highest level ever reached by an African American in county government : chief administrative officer . <p> Although Glendening says race played no role in the selection , there 's little doubt that he has benefited politically from the symbolism of appointing such a high-profile black man in a county that 's become majority black in the last decade . Riddick also has helped insulate Glendening from some of the racial conflicts that could have roiled his administration . It was Riddick , for instance , who took the lead in defusing tensions after a highly publicized incident involving the death of a black man in police custody in 1989 . <p> Riddick 's tenure in Prince George 's has not unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been as willing to challenge Glendening as previous chief administrative officers had and that he should have pushed his boss to deal more forcefully with the budget squeeze that continues to plague the county . <p> On occasions , Riddick has misstepped publicly : He drew criticism from civic activists when he convened a meeting of Prince George 's employees on county time to organize opposition to a ballot initiative that would have imposed a new ceiling on property tax revenue . Maryland State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli ruled that the meeting technically violated state law but declined to pursue a criminal investigation . <p> Even Riddick 's critics , however , marvel at his relentless drive . A lanky man who rises every morning at 5 to exercise for an hour in his home gymnasium , Riddick is a computer enthusiast who spends hours going over new software programs with his 14-year-old daughter , Myrica . <p> He spends his free time reading management theory , although lately there 's been little down time for the doggedly upbeat man who characterizes his philosophy as " work harder than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful as I can . " <p> His wife , Manervia , an executive with Washington Gas Light Co. , said Riddick brings an almost childlike intensity to his assorted responsibilities . <p> " He just has an incredible energy level , " she said . " He 's almost like a little kid in this regard . He just runs and runs and runs  --  and then he stops . " <p> In keeping with his career in the bowels of government , Riddick lards his speech with jargon familiar to bureaucrats that occasionally needs translating for the uninitiated , a tendency Glendening himself has joked about in Cabinet meetings . <p> Here is a classic Riddickism from a recent interview : " I look for decisions that are not Major Riddick 's decisions . I look for decisions that I believe are components of Parris 's needs . " <p> Translation : Riddick tries to enact Glendening 's programs without imposing his own agenda . <p> But Riddick 's public role has grown beyond that of a typical bureaucrat . Longtime residents of Fort Washington , a mecca for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riddicks have an extensive array of contacts in the state 's business and professional communities and have deployed them on behalf of Curry and other favored politicians . <p> Riddick 's overlapping political loyalties  --  particularly to Glendening and Curry  --  can create potential conflicts of interest . At the moment , Riddick is on the hot seat because of Curry 's not-so-subtle efforts to suggest that Glendening left him a budget mess in Prince George 's . <p> By extension , the suggestion implicates Glendening 's chief administrative officer , who helped craft a fiscal strategy several years ago that included what some critics say was risky short-term borrowing to avoid steeper spending cuts . <p> Some political observers said they wonder whether Curry really could have been left in the dark , given his close ties to Riddick . Yet , in an interview last week , Riddick said he did not know how serious Prince George 's financial woes were until recent projections showed county tax revenue leveling off next year . Had he known , Riddick said , he would have privately warned Curry off of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he sees his role as a " facilitator " between the two strong-willed political leaders and that he believes he can be of benefit to both . <p> " I do n't care who they are  --  the governor and this county executive need each other , " Riddick said . <p> " Even if I 'm Parris 's person , but I 'm in the room when decisions are being made , it 's probably a good thing from Wayne 's perspective .
