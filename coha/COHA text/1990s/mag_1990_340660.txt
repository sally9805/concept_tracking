To several generations of moviegoers , Greta Garbo was only the world 's most famous recluse . Was n't she the star who , in the 1932 film Grand Hotel , had murmured , " I want to be alone " and then played out that role for the rest of her life ? What else could excite the old awe when she died last week , at 84 , ) from complications of kidney disease ? After all , Garbo stopped making movies when she was 36 , nearly a half-century ago . She never won an Oscar . She worked with few good directors , made fewer great films than any star of comparable magnitude . She appeared in 14 silent features , then 14 talkies beginning in 1930  --  but even in that era her fervid , hypnotic style of acting was an odd anachronism . Except in drag clubs , she inspired no real imitators . But Garbo was more than a camp goddess . She was just the most haunting beauty , and the finest actress , in movie history . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kenneth Tynan wrote , " one sees in Garbo sober . " But it was n't the beauty alone that intoxicated . Garbo used her severe gorgeousness to suggest that the characters she played were creatures from a nobler , alien world , doomed to exile among the puny men and cramped conventions of earth . She was typecast as the siren who lures men to hell , only to get there first ; but her pained dignity gave the lie to cliche . This Garbo lived by a standard too high for men to reach , so they grabbed what they could touch  --  her body . " How little you know of love , " she sighs in A Woman of Affairs , " my kind of love . " Her films , from Flesh and the Devil to The Mysterious Lady , from Anna Christie to Anna Karenina , were a master course in the varieties of that kind of love : desperate , consuming , exalted . They were also lessons in her kind of star acting . Cinema would never again see its like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its genesis as in its impact . She was born Greta Gustafsson to a poor Stockholm family , and at first she gave little hint of her unique hold on the camera . In early publicity films she giggles and models dresses or gorges on a cream puff . There is no beauty here , no acting ability . What could Mauritz Stiller , the pioneer Swedish director , have seen in this plump teenager ? Maybe the future of movies . He changed her name to Garbo , cast her as the young female lead in his The Story of Gosta Berling ( 1924 ) , then brought her along to Hollywood . The rest of their story is too trite and tragic for even a Garbo vehicle . Stiller was fired from The Temptress , their only American film together . He went home and died two years later . <P> From then on , and despite headline-grabbing flirtations with John Gilbert and Leopold Stokowski , Garbo became in effect the indentured mistress of her movie studio , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . This most galvanizing of actresses was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Garbo slimmed down , had her teeth capped , adjusted her hairline . Her most enduring studio ally was her doting cinematographer , William Daniels . Garbo must have felt comfortable , surrounded by MGM 's middlebrow high gloss . She may not have cared that its gentility suffocated her films , so long as she could breathe her artistry into them .
