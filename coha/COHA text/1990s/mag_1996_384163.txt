When the going got tough in World War II , the U.S. Army called on its first soldiers on skis . // Camp Hale , Colo. , looked more like a ski resort than a U.S. Army training post But for us soldiers in the 10th Mountain Division , it was no vacation . The 10th was the United States ' first Alpine division-we were soldiers on skis . And in 1942 , as World War II gripped Europe , we were ready for action . We all were volunteers . Many were Scouts , with strong outdoor skills . We were an unusual assortment of mountain guides , rock climbers , farm boys with mule-packing experience and a lot of guys from college ski teams . Tough Training-and a Little Fun But before we were shipped off to Europe , the Army had to make sure we were in fighting condition . And the training we underwent was almost tougher than the real thing . Camp Hale , 10,000 feet up in the Colorado Rocky Mountains , was surrounded by peaks up to 14,000 feet . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the added burden of skis and Arctic clothing in winter and climbing gear in summer . The training of the10th also included mountain survival , rock climbing and-best of all-skiing . We hardly looked like a disciplined military installation as the enthusiastic troops hot-dogged down the slopes . Even in wartime , you have to have some fun ! 12,000 Feet High and Hungry The final maneuver at Camp Hale in 1944-called " D Series " - was one of the most rugged exercises ever engaged in by U.S. troops . The men left camp with skis , sleeping bags good to 30 degrees below zero , reversible tents and rucksacks with a few days of food for a six-week practice battle . No one knew a fierce winter storm was on the way . It was so cold that rifles froze , and the radio operators had to sleep with their batteries to keep them warm . No supplies could get in . At one point , one of the radio operators was tuned in to an Air Force channel when he heard two fighter pilots talking . One said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other answered , " I 'm at 9,000 feet and climbing . " The trooper could not resist the temptation and cut in , " I 'm at 12,000 feet and hungry . " The D Series ended with some cases of frostbite , but no one starved . Off to War In 1944 , the war had been raging in Europe for five years . We were shipped off to the mountains of Italy , and we spent Christmas Eve in Naples , preparing for battle . Our first big battle against Adolf Hitler 's German army came a few weeks later-the capture of Riva Ridge and Mount Belvedere in the Apennine Mountains . The U.S. Fifth Army had tried three times to take out these strong points . Each time it had been driven back . Riva Ridge was several miles long but offered only four entry routes . Highly trained rock-climbing teams explored these rocky , snowy routes at night , weeks before the attack . // Facts About the 10th // A day or two before the battle , we all hiked to the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the at tack our climbing teams went up first and attached fixed ropes . Later our troops climbed these ropes to capture the ridge . The next day Mount Belvedere also fell to the Mountaineers . Later battles found the 10th Mountain Division crossing the Po River and fighting into the rugged area around Lake Garda in northern Italy . It was never routine duty . One night a sergeant was leading a patrol in the mountains to discover the enemy 's position . The patrol was moving carefully through a snow-covered valley when a voice called out in German , " What are you doing down there ? " The quick-thinking sergeant answered in perfect German , " Just another back-breaking wood-gathering detail . " The enemy answered back , " Well , be on the alert We think there is an American patrol in the area , and they are wearing white outfits just like you . " The Mountain Troops Ride Again We saw plenty of action with the ski troops . But our most lasting task was after the war , when many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dog sledding . We like to think the popularity of these winter sports and activities today is largely because of the efforts of the men of the 10th . When the Mountain Division was deactivated after WWII , it was said there would never be another division like it . But today there is a new 10th Mountain Division based at Fort Drum , N.Y . In addition to mountain skills , they are trained in desert and jungle fighting . The kings of the mountains are alive and well .
