Last week Erbakan became the head of the first Islamist-majority coalition government in Turkey since Kemal Ataturk declared it a secular state in 1923 . In two years ' time , Erbakan is due to hand over power to Ciller and her True Path Party . The deal was ratified during a parliamentary vote of confidence that provoked the wildest scenes the National Assembly has seen in many years . <P> The ascension of an Islamist party to power , according to the Turkish Daily News , was viewed in some circles as " the end of the world . " But Erbakan and Ciller quickly set about trying to reassure everyone that there is nothing to fear from an Islamist-led government . Turkey is a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangerous part of the world , so Western diplomats were the particular targets of soothing words . Erbakan is a pragmatist , and while he has often denounced NATO and the West , he has now backed away from his Islamic hyperbole . <P> This spirit of accommodation has extended to his new partner . In recent months , Erbakan initiated corruption investigations against Ciller . Now he may backpedal on those probes , and presumably Ciller will no longer describe an alliance with Erbakan 's Welfare Party ( Refah ) as " plunging the country into darkness . " There is nothing quite like the opportunity to take high office to make people see past their differences . <P>  --  By Rod Usher .
