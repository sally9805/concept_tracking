From the merely eccentric to the downright bizarre seems to be only half a step for Ross Perot . The populist billionaire last week came up with a new explanation for why he had abandoned his initial presidential campaign on July 16 : he wanted to save his daughter Carolyn from a smear . Seems he got wind from three sources  --  two unnamed , one a frequent promoter of conspiracy theories  --  of a Republican plot to portray his daughter as a lesbian by circulating a doctored photograph , then to " disrupt " her Aug. 23 wedding by means unspecified . By Oct. 1 , with Carolyn married , Perot presumably figured it was safe to get back into the race . <P> It all seemed most unlikely . Noting the army of guards Perot employs , a skeptical former business associate remarked , " The guy 's got more security around his family than the Kremlin . And he ca n't protect a wedding ? " Perot in fact admitted he had no proof , and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quickly compared him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perot does have a history of scenting conspiracies everywhere , and one of his suspicions seems to have inspired a questionable FBI sting . After Perot complained to Dallas police about an alleged Republican plot to wiretap him , Jim Oberwetter , head of President Bush 's Texas campaign , was approached by an FBI agent posing as a cowboy . The agent offered to sell a tape of Perot phone conversations . Oberwetter spurned him . <P> Perot 's vagaries stopped but did not reverse his meteoric rise in the polls . Several tracking surveys showed his support at 16% , down a bit from around 20% but still more than enough to make Perot 's wild-card effect on the campaign both important and unpredictable . The Texan is putting on a last-gasp TV advertising blitz like none ever seen before . His campaign has spent just under $60 million so far , and that figure will grow sharply in the final week . <P> For the two main candidates , the campaign end game seemed likely to underline one of the oldest  --  and most overlooked  --  truisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national vote but a combination of 50 separate state elections . In one Gallup/CNN/USA Today tracking poll , Bush surged to a statistical tie , pulling 40% to Clinton 's 41% . Other polls showed the Democrat 's lead around seven points , but all indicated it was narrowing . Bush reacted by slamming harder than ever on " character " issues . Clinton hit back personally as he had not before , saying Bush was the one not worthy of trust . Bush 's great problem , though , is that state-by-state surveys show Clinton with so big a lead in electoral votes that the President would have to win just about every doubtful state to remain in the White House . While that could still happen , it seems more likely that Clinton would parlay a narrow victory in the popular vote into a comfortable margin in the electoral college .
