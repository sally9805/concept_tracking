If we are talking creativity and ideas , Bill Gates is an American unoriginal . He is Microsoft 's chief and co-founder , he is the world 's richest man , and his career delivers this message : It can be wiser to follow than to lead . Let the innovators hit the beaches and take the losses ; if you hold back and follow , you can clean up in peace and quiet . <P> Gates is the Bing Crosby of American technology , borrowing a tune here and a tune there and turning them all into great boffo hits  --  by dint of heroic feats of repackaging and sheer Herculean blandness . Granted he is ( to put it delicately ) an unusually hard-driving and successful businessman , but the Bill Gates of our imagination is absurdly overblown . <P> Yet we have also been unfair to him . Few living Americans have been so resented , envied and vilified , but in certain ways his career is distinguished by decency  --  and he has n't got much credit for it . Technology confuses us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have barked up a lot of wrong trees . <P> A 1968 photo shows Bill as a rapt young teenager , watching his friend Paul Allen type at a computer terminal . Allen became a co-founder of Microsoft . The child Gates has neat hair and an eager , pleasant smile ; every last detail says " pat me on the head . " He entered Harvard but dropped out to found Microsoft in 1975 . Microsoft 's first product was a version of the programming language BASIC for the Altair 8800 , arguably the world 's first personal computer . BASIC , invented by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz in 1964 , was someone else 's idea . So was the Altair . Gates merely plugged one into the other , cream-cheesed the waiting bagel and came up with a giant hit . <P> By 1980 , IBM had decided to build personal computers and needed a PC operating system . ( Computers are born naked ; they need operating systems to be presentable . ) Mammoth , blue-chip IBM employed thousands of capable software builders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired Microsoft to build its operating system . Microsoft bought Q-DOS from a company called Seattle Computer Products and retailored it for the PC . <P> The PC was released in August 1981 and was followed into the market by huge flocks of honking , beeping clones . Microsoft 's DOS was one of three official PC operating systems but quickly beat out the other two . DOS was clunky and primitive at a time when the well-dressed computer was wearing UNIX from Bell Labs or ( if its tastes ran upscale ) some variant of the revolutionary window-menu-mouse system that Xerox had pioneered in the 1970s . But despite ( or maybe because of ) its stodginess , DOS established itself as the school uniform of computing . It was homely , but everyone needed it . Once again , Gates had brokered a marriage between other people 's ideas and come up with a hit . DOS was even bigger than BASIC . Gates had it made . <P> Apple released the Macintosh in January 1984 : a tony , sophisticated computer was now available to the masses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it continued to rake in money , so what if the critics hated it ? In May 1990 , Microsoft finally perfected its own version of Apple windows and called it Microsoft Windows 3.0  --  another huge hit . Now Gates really ( I mean really ) had it made .
