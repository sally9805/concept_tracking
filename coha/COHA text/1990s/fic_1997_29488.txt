Chapter One At first , there 's only darkness . Then a slight stirring breeze and a dot of light from somewhere deep in the tunnel . The dot turns into a beam and the beam widens as the train approaches the station . The man in the Yankees cap and the MTA jacket stands near the edge of the platform , watching , considering . The growing metallic roar almost matches the scream in his head . The light washes over the tiled walls and focuses into a pair of headlights aimed up the tracks . The train will arrive in fifteen seconds . In five seconds , it will be too late for the driver to throw the emergency brake . The man in the Yankees cap moves closer to the edge , waiting for the sound to catch up to the light . Trying to decide if the right moment is coming . In the Dispatch Office of the 241st Street station in the Bronx , the red light has stopped moving across the black model board . Somewhere between East Tremont Avenue and 174th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Mel Green puts a soft thick finger up to the red light and shakes his head . " I bet it 's another flat-liner , " he says . " A flat-liner ? " A bald-headed conductor from Trinidad named Ernest Bayard looks up from his poppy-seed bagel and his Shoppe-at-Home catalogue . " You know , a twelve-nine , man under , one of them guys jumps in front of a moving train , " says Mel , who has a squared-off haircut and wears a purple T-shirt that says IMPROVE YOUR IMAGE-BE SEEN WITH ME . " We been having a lot of those lately . " " Why 's that ? " " I do n't know . Do n't they say April is the cruel month ? " Ernest shrugs and goes back to looking at the hibachi ads in the catalogue . A number 3 train passes like an apartment house sliding by sideways . New York faces in a blur . The dingy beige room rumbles . Two conductors play chess under a clock that says it 's five after eight in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , " says Mel , adjusting the brown Everlast weight belt around his middle . " Big fat guy was sitting on the tracks at the Union Square station . Four train passes over him . Transit cop comes down and says , ' How you doing ? ' Guy looks up , says , ' Tell you the truth , I 'm kinda nervous . It 's only the third or fourth time I 've done this . ' " " Man , that 's a lotta bullshit , that 's what that is . " Ernest laughs and flips to the patio furniture ads as John Gates walks in , wearing his Yankees cap and MTA jacket . The dust particles in the air suddenly seem to move a little faster and the scrambled eggs in the office microwave glow a little brighter . Another departing train shakes the room . " Hey , John G. ! " says Ernest . " No way nohow you sit in front of a four train and live , right ? " John G. stares at him blankly and says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was lying down , " Mel Green mutters . " All I know is if I had one of those , I 'd just pull the brake and close my eyes . " Ernest turns halfway around in his seat and puts his hands in front of his face . " I do n't need to see that shit in my dreams . " " Yo , Johnny , you all right ? " Mel watches him . John G. has raccoon circles around his eyes and a chin dusky with three days ' beard . He 's a pale skinny Irish guy in his mid-thirties with a gauntly handsome face and discreet tattoos on both arms . In another era , he might have been said to have the look of a merchant seaman . Now he just seems like someone who 's spent too many nights hanging out on street corners . " Yeah , I 'm all right , " he says . Everyone 's noticed him acting a little buggy lately . Staring into space , mumbling to himself in the motorman 's cabin . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal : showing up for duty with a Tec-9 machine gun . But no one wants to say anything to headquarters on Jay Street just yet . John G. 's always been a solid dude ; he 's made employee of the month three times in the last five years . Besides , the man 's been broken . Give him some space . " You sure you all do n't want Ray Burnham to take the shift for you ? " Mel asks . " You worked Kwanza for him , right ? " " Nah , it 's okay ... " John G. stares at the general orders on the bulletin board like a man in a trance . " Hey , John , you had two , did n't you ? " Ernest the conductor looks over his shoulder . " Two what ? " John G. 's mouth goes slack . He still has n't taken off his hat or his jacket . " Two twelve-nines . You know . Track pizzas . " Mel 's throwing him a lifeline , trying to drag him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock on the wall makes a loud clicking sound . The two conductors stop playing chess and look over . " Yeah , I think I had two . " John G. swats absently at a stream of dust passing under a desk lamp . " I do n't really remember ... " Another train goes by . " One was , like , three years ago , " says Mel , trying to be helpful , " and the other was ... " His hand hangs in the air , waiting for his mouth to complete the thought . An awkward silence fills the room as it dawns on everyone that this may not be a fit topic for discussion . " And the other was just before the thing with your little girl , " Mel says quickly , trying to finish the thought and move on to something else . John G. stares at him for a long time without speaking . His eyes are like lightbulbs with the filaments burned out . " I did n't go looking for them , Mel , " he says quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey . " Mel throws up his hands . " No one said it was your fault , John G. " John G. carries his radio along the outdoor platform , heading for his train . The sky opens up above him like God 's eyelid . Everything is strange now . The world is different , but all the people keep going on as if nothing has changed . The maintenance workers in orange-and-yellow vests clean out the garbage bins . A man with his body cut in half pulls himself along on a dolly with wheels . A young black guy in a business suit gets on board with a briefcase and a copy of the Haiti Observateur . Two pale white guys wearing Sikh turbans follow him . John G. is having trouble putting it all together in his mind . Less than a half hour ago , he was ready to jump in front of a train himself . But something inside him wo n't let him cross that threshold just yet . By eight-fifteen , he 's in the motorman 's cabin , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He takes out the picture of his wife and daughter that he carries in his wallet and sets it on the ledge in front of him . Ernest , the conductor , gives the all-clear signal ; he 's about to close the doors . John G. pushes down on the metal handle , letting air into the brakes , and the train lurches forward , beginning the long trip through the heart of the city . There 's relief in the ritual and routine . Seeing the same faces , making the same stops . He 's getting through life minute by minute these days-scrounging for reasons to keep going . Most of the ride through the Bronx is aboveground , taking him over the rough topography of his childhood . Tar roofs . Wide streets . Spanish churches , gas stations , and lots filled with garbage and old tires . Some days it 's like a roller-coaster ride . The rise up to Gun Hill Road , the steep drop before Pelham Parkway , the wild curve into Bronx Park East . But just before the Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness swallows it like a mouth . He 's in the long tunnel . Cheap fun-house lights flash by on the left . A baby cries in the car behind him . Though he 's been making this trip every weekday for two years , that fast descent always fills him with dread . As he snakes past Grand Concourse and then 135th Street , his worst impulses begin to crowd him . Go ahead , the voice in his head says . Hop off at 125th Street . Go smoke some crack on Lenox Avenue . Let the passengers fend for themselves . This train is out of service . But it 's not so easy to quit . As he pulls up to the next platform , he sees a tall , exhausted-looking Hispanic woman , done up in a red-and-white striped dress and lacquered hair , cradling a sickly child in her arms . A working mother bringing her daughter to the doctor or day care . Maybe a secretary on Wall Street or a receptionist . He pictures her in a cramped Morningside Heights apartment , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next room . Botanica candles on the windowsill , slipcovers on the couch , framed baby pictures on the bedroom dresser . The bathroom so clean and white you could go blind turning on the light in the middle of the night . If she 's got a husband , he 's probably off doing the early shift at the garage or the loading dock , with the pork sandwich she made for him in his lunch box . Not rich people , but not poor either . Just clinging to one another and dragging themselves into the future . And a life he should have had . Grinding the train to a halt , John G. feels obliged to get her wherever she wants to go . Pressure , pressure . Stay on schedule . His eyes are tired and his head is starting to ache . Just outside the Times Square station , he gets a red signal and a call from the master control tower . " You got a twelve-seven . You 're being held because of a sick passenger in the train up ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When we hear , you 'll hear . " It 's as useless talking to supervisors as trying to probe the mind of God . God . For some reason , he finds himself thinking a lot about God this morning . Why does God do things ? Why does God make trains stop ? Why does God take the life of a child ? There 's an angry pounding on the door of his cabin . " Come on , boy ! Give us some speed ! " He tries to radio back to the control tower , but all he gets is a blizzard of voices and static . No answers . There 's too little air in the cabin . He throws open the door , just so he can breathe . A car full of riders stares back at him . Men in dark suits . Women in running shoes and silk blouses . Young people on their way in the world , determining the value of the dollar , the price of doing business , the cost of living . " Why is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , a weak-chinned white guy in tortoise-shell rimmed glasses and a khaki poplin suit . He stands under the ad for Dr. Tusch , hemorrhoid M.D. What does it say in the procedure book ? John G. tries to remember . BE CAREFUL NOT TO IGNORE YOUR PASSENGERS . WHEN YOU IGNORE THEM , EVEN FOR A LITTLE WHILE , THEY THINK THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM . AND IF THEY THINK THAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM , THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO CAUSE YOU AND THE SYSTEM A PROBLEM . " I 'm sorry , sir , " says John G. " It 's beyond my control . " The weak-chinned guy turns to a friend of his , a young man with a face as pink and round as a baby 's bottom . " See ? They only get idiots to do these jobs . " John G. stands there with his eyelids throbbing . Should he take a swing at the guy ? After all , he 's got nothing left to lose . On the other hand , this job is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked his place in the world is gone . He struggles to decide for a few seconds and then goes back to the motorman 's cabin . Beyond my control . He looks at the picture of his family on the cabin ledge . By the time he gets the train rolling again , it 's seven minutes behind schedule . More pressure . His head feels as if it 's filling up with helium . Pillars flash by like tiger stripes before his eyes . He forgets where he is for a few seconds and when he comes to again , the tracks are curving and Ernest , the conductor , is announcing the next stop is Fourteenth Street . John does n't remember Thirty-fourth . He looks down and sees the speedometer reading fifty-three , fifty-four , fifty-five . Brake shoes scream on rusty corroded tracks . The car rocks dangerously from side to side . Ghost stations , local stops , graffiti swirls , work crews . They all go rocketing by . His eyes barely have time to register them . There 's too much going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees the yellow signal . Then the green over yellow indicating the tracks are about to switch the train over to the local side . But something 's wrong . There 's someone on the tracks beyond the switch . He blows his horn but the figure does n't move . A man waving his arms . Beckoning . Come on . Do it . Run me over . One part of John G. 's brain is denying it , telling him this is n't happening . He blinks and the man is gone . But when he blinks again , the man is back , waving him on with both arms . Blood rushes out of John G. 's heart and runs straight into his head . Stop . You 're about to do it again . The train comes hammering around the bend at sixty miles an hour , spraying the air with steel dust . There 's no time to decide which of the visions is real : the beckoning man on the local tracks or the empty space . He just has to act . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait for the switch , he keeps going at maximum power onto the express side . But then the darkness breaks and he sees he 's made a terrible mistake . Another train is sitting directly in front of him at the station . The white-on-red number 3 on the last car grows like a bloodshot eye . He reaches for the emergency brake but it 's too late . He 's going to crash . A screech like a buzz saw cuts through his ears . Lights go out in the car behind him . Bodies whiplash against the sides . Voices cry out . In the nearing distance , he sees people backing away from the edge of the platform . They 're thinking subway crash . They 're thinking bits of twisted metal , torn concrete , and body parts found among the debris . They 're thinking last moments before life slips away amid terror and confusion . But at the last possible second , he throws the brake and the mechanical track arm hits the trip cock on the undercarriage . Instead of stopping short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the number 3 . There 's a jolt and the whole train shudders . John G. looks up and sees a shrunken old Asian woman staring at him from the back window of the 3 train . She looks less scared than sad , as if she somehow understands what 's driven him to this point . The radio bleats . " What the fuck happened there ? ! " asks the voice from the master control tower . " There was someone down on the tracks , " he says . There 's a pause and then static . In the car behind him , he hears people straightening themselves up and weeping in relief , trying to adjust to life at an angle . The voice on the radio comes back again . " Eight-one-five , there 's no report of anyone on the tracks , " it says . " You been seeing things ? " John G. says nothing . He tries to picture the figure he saw on the local side , but there 's no afterimage in his mind . Only black space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eight-one-five , you just missed killing about two thousand people , " says the voice on the radio . " I hope you 're happy . " He stumbles numb out of the cabin and looks around . The scene in the car is a low-budget disaster movie . No one looks seriously hurt , but some people are still on the floor crying .
