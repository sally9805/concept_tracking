As you no doubt have heard , China is the world 's biggest emerging market : 1.2 billion potential consumers for cars , TV sets , patio furniture , all the stuff we 've already got . This is the era of global investing , it is said , and the sophisticated investor ca n't afford to ignore China , an exciting economy with a great future , because the most ardent capitalists you 'll ever meet are the Chinese communists . <P> Taking the sophisticated route myself , I bought shares in a China mutual fund in my typical fashion : invest before you investigate . A recent trip to Hong Kong gave me the chance to do the latter , so the first thing I did when I got back home was to sell my China holdings , such as they were . Everybody in Hong Kong thinks China has a great future . It 's the Chinese companies you have to worry about . <P> These beauties were created by U.S. investment bankers , who roam the countryside looking for prospects . They take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring them out as public companies . The ones that trade on the Chinese stock exchange are the diciest , while a slightly better class of company is sold in Hong Kong , and six of the blue chips ( they call them red chips ) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange . <P> The first problem is that the new companies have no experience in acting like companies . The idea that they are profit-making operations that owe their allegiance to people known as shareholders has n't completely sunk in . When they get their hands on the proceeds of a stock sale , they do n't necessarily spend it for the intended purpose . Maybe they were in the textile business , but the next thing you know , the management is making a movie or opening dim- sum joints . <P> A case in point is a chemical company known as Tianjin Bohai , which trades in Hong Kong . I heard about this one from Bill Kaye , who runs the Hong Kong- based Asian Hedge Fund for private clients . According to Kaye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash , a valuable commodity in China . As soon as the firm got cash , it started lending it to other companies . From what I could gather , Chinese companies maintain a close relationship with the state enterprises from which they came and sometimes can be pressured into making loans and even donations to their old cronies . I 'm also told that the Chinese consider it very impolite to turn down a request for financial assistance . <P> This brings us to problem No. 2 : How can the Chinese companies make a profit ? In many instances , their biggest customer is the state , which does n't necessarily pay its bills on time . This leads to the disappointments noted by Fidelity 's man in Hong Kong , Bill Ebsworth . " They have a habit of disappearing , " he says , referring to the earnings . <P> Disappearing earnings have already become the bugaboo of China Tire , which was born on the New York Stock Exchange in July 1993  --  a $100 million offering orchestrated by Morgan Stanley . China , tires  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't . " All Morgan Stanley did was pull a couple of outmoded bias-ply tire plants off the shelf and repackage them . It 's going to take a lot of money to convert those plants to radials . Meanwhile , China Tire is n't being paid for the tires it sells already . "
