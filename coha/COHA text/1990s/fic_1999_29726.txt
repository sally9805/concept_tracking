I Eavesdrop , and Hear Ill of Myself Let every woman , then , bear in mind , that , just so long as her dress and position oppose any resistance to the motion of her chest , in just such proportion her blood is unpurified , and her vital organs are debilitated.  - -  Miss Catherine E. Beecher , A Treatise on Domestic Economy , for the Use of Young Ladies at Home , p. 117 I have made up my mind to begin my account upon the first occasion when I truly knew where things stood with me , that is , that afternoon of the day my father , Arthur Harkness , was taken to the Quincy graveyard and buried between my mother , Cora Mary Harkness , and his first wife , Ella Harkness . My father 's death was not unexpected , and perhaps not even unwelcome , for he was eighty-two years old and had for some years been lost in a second childhood . I could easily sit beside the floor grate in my small former room above the front parlor of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . The little bed I had slept in as a child was pushed back against the wall to make room for discarded sticks of furniture and some old cases . I sat on a rolled-up piece of carpet . Ella Harkness 's daughters numbered six . Of those , two had gone back to New York State with their husbands . Our three , Harriet , Alice , and Beatrice , were all considerably older than I , the only living child of the seven my mother had borne . Miriam , my favorite of the sisters , a schoolmistress in Ohio , had died , too , of a sudden fever just before Christmas . Sometwenty years separated me from Harriet , and all the others were even older than she was . I had many nephews and nieces who were my own age or older and , it must be said ( was often said ) , better tempered and better behaved . Some of my nephews and nieces had children of their own . I was what you might call an odd lot , not very salable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be the first to say . . . " I could see Harriet from above . She squirmed in her seat and smoothed her black mourning dress for the hundredth time . She wore the same dress to every funeral , and the only way we 'd gotten her into it this time was to lace her as tight as a sausage . The others let her be the first to say it . I leaned back , so my shadow would n't fall through the grating . " It do n't repay what you feed her , since she do n't do a lick of work . " " She a n't been properly taught 's the truth , " said Beatrice , " but that 's her misfortune . " No doubt here she threw a look at Alice . " I 've had my own to worry about , " complained Alice . Since Cora Mary 's death , I 'd been seven years with Alice . The easiest thing in the world for Alice was to lose things -- her thimble , her flour dredger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it was up to you . She was a churchgoing woman , too , but whenever she forgot her prayers , she would say , " If the Lord wants me , he knows where to find me . " That was Alice all over . Needless to say , I generally found myself elsewhere , and I would wager that was fine with her . Her own brood numbered six , mostly boys , so they were more often than not busy losing themselves , too . It was my niece Annie who kept the engine running at Alice 's . Right then , in fact , Annie was out in the kitchen , getting our tea . It would n't have occurred to Harriet , Beatrice , or Alice to lift a finger to help her . It occurred to me , of course , but that hole of kitchen work was one I did n't care to fall into , because it was easy to see how those women would pull up the ladder , and there you 'd be , hauling wood and water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " We could have sent her on the cars to Miriam . Young people her age seem to go on the cars without a speck of fear . Or Miriam could have come got her . " This was Harriet . They pondered my sister Miriam , a spinster who 'd taught reading to little Negro children in Yellow Springs . Harriet 's tone revealed some sense of injury that Miriam was no longer capable of being of use in this way . But Miriam had been a strict woman , the sweetest but the strictest of them all . Her fondness for me had been mostly the result of the distance between us and our lively correspondence . I knew that even if Miriam were still living and I had gone to her on the cars and tried to stay with her , the sweetness would bit by bit have gone out and the strictness bit by bit come in . But I missed her . " Miriam was genuinely fond of her . " Beatrice expressed this as a great marvel . " Where is Lydia ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have leaned forward and looked around for me . " Outdoors , " said Alice , and I would have been , too , but my heavy mourning dress , wool serge and buttoned to the throat , gave the sunny summer hillside that was my usual resort all the attractions of the Great Sahara Desert . I had crept upstairs and undressed down to my shift . The black armor I would soon need to don again seemed to hold my shape where it lay over the back of a chair . I lifted the hem of my shift and fanned myself with it . " Out in the barn , most likely . " Alice amplified her speculation with all the assurance of someone who never knew what she was talking about . " Oh , the poor orphaned child , " exclaimed Beatrice , and for a moment I did n't realize she was speaking of me . " Alone in the world ! " " She 's twenty years old , sister . " Harriet 's tone was decidedly cool . " I was safely married at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitors , who 's to blame for that ? " " And she has us , " said Alice . Oh , the poor orphaned child , I thought . It was true as they said that I was useless , that I had perversely cultivated uselessness over the years and had reached , as I then thought , a pitch of uselessness that was truly rare , or even unique , among the women of Quincy , Illinois . I could neither ply a needle nor play an instrument . I knew nothing of baking or cookery , could not be relied upon to wash the clothes on washing day nor lay a fire in the kitchen stove . My predilections ran in other directions , but they were useless , too . I could ride a horse astride , saddle or no saddle . I could walk for miles without tiring . I could swim and had swum the width of the river . I could bait a hook and catch a fish . I could write a good letter in a clear hand . I had been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 'd been especially fond of a lively dispute . Worse , I was plain . Worse than that , I had refused the three elderly widowers who had made me offers and expected that I would be happy to raise their packs of motherless children . Worst of all , I had refused them without any show of gratitude or regret . So , I freely concede , there was noth-ing to be done with me . My sisters were entirely correct and thoroughly justified in their concern for me . It was likely that I would end up on their hands forever , useless and ungrateful . I stood up and moved away from the vent , suddenly weary of the certain outcome of their speculations . Back to Alice , back to the strange languor of that life . It vexed me , too , that though their afternoon of complaint and self-justification would result in nothing new , they would make their way through it , anyway , like cows following the same old meandering track through their all too familiar pasture and coming upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected . I looked out my window upon the slope in front of my father 's house . There had been no funeral supper , none but the quietest and most subdued gathering of the few around town who 'd known my father . Each of my sisters ' husbands had returned to his business or farm directly from the graveyard . All of us , I knew , would find a way to put off our mourning clothes as soon as possible . Even before my father lost himself , he was a silent and vain man . Just the sort of man who would approach a plain woman like my mother without the least pretense or compunction and invite her to leave her own parents and come over to him , to care for his six daughters and bear him a son . He had been fine to look at , with glossy curling hair and full whiskers . Perhaps she was gratified at being chosen at last for the very usefulness she had cultivated so long . My hair , as usual , was falling about my face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row beside my small looking glass , and picked up my brush . My hair was long and thick . As I lifted it off my neck and pulled the brush up underneath it , I could n't help feeling that in spite of every iota of evidence to the contrary , something was about to happen . My sister Beatrice 's husband , Mr. Horace Silk , sold dry goods on Maine , at Lorton and Silk . Mr. Jonas Silk , the old man and Horace 's father , held the reins of the business in a tight grip . Lorton was long dead . As a result , Horace was as little consumed by his interest in calico and muslin as he was much consumed by his interest in western land . Iowa , Nebraska , Kansas -- the walls of L and S Co. were papered with bills that offered , for a fair and reasonable sum , city lots in lovely , tree-shaded towns , country farms watered by sweet flowing streams , gristmills , sawmills , ironworks , every sort of business . Brother Horace and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues of every region , every town , every named river and stream . They were forever putting together their investments , forever outlining schemes , forever scouring their relatives for funds , but in truth Mr. Jonas Silk was as niggardly as he was jealous , and my sister Beatrice had as much interest in Kansas as she did in the czar of all the Russias , and so my brother Mr. Horace Silk worked out his plans in a white heat of frustrated eagerness . Of all the women , it was only I who listened to the men , though I made no show of doing so . The towns I favored numbered three : One was Salley Fork , Nebraska , where the grid of streets ran down a gentle southern slope to the sandy , oak-shaded banks of the cool , meandering Salley River and where the ladies ' aid society had already received numerous subscriptions for the town library , which was to be built that very summer . Town the second was Morrison 's Landing , Iowa , on the Missouri , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow that the farmers were already reaping untold wealth from their very first plantings . The third was Walnut Grove , Kansas , where the sawmill , the gristmill , and the largest dry goods emporium west of Independence , Missouri , were already in full operation . Horace himself had a fancy for a farm on the Marais des Cygnes River in Kansas , which was the finest farming land in the world and , according to the bill , located in the best , most healthful climate -- just warm enough in the summer to ripen crops , always refreshed by a cool breeze , and never colder in the winter than a salubrious forty degrees . Fruit and nut trees of all varieties , bramble fruits , and even peaches were guaranteed to grow there . For many months , one of my main pleasures in life had been to linger in L and S , prolonging my errands there for Alice and gazing upon the delightful bills , with their neat street maps and architectural drawings . Quincy , which had been a mere handful of buildings when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , my chances of getting to any of these places seemed at least as remote as Horace Silk 's , and as often as I gazed upon my favorite bills , I also vowed to put away the thoughts that agitated me . My sisters were as fixed in their various homes as stones , and as difficult to lift . I had no money of my own and no companion . Even my father 's old horse had died some three years before , never to be replaced , since my father had no use for a horse . That horse was the last familiar creature that he remembered the name of . As recently as six months before his death , sister Beatrice found him in the barn , looking at the horse 's empty stall and muttering , " Wellington . " That was the horse 's name , after the duke himself . I turned from the glare of the window and crept back to the carpet roll . There I squatted and peered down . Harriet was fanning herself . Her face was bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice chicken business . " " And where , " said Alice , " would we set her up with this nice chicken business ? And . . . " She paused and caught her breath indignantly . " If Horace is going to set anyone up in a nice chicken business , then in my opinion Annie is far more deserving and would certainly do well at it . Annie gets very little consideration , I must say . You have more room on your farm , Harriet , for any sort of nice chicken business than we have on our town lot , a double one though it may be and as big as any . " " I know the end of that , " complained Harriet . " More work for me when she lets her chickens run wild . I have my own chickens , as many as I can handle . " I wanted to shout down through the grating that every woman in Quincy had a nice chicken business , that the chicken trade was over-subscribed , but I held my tongue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beatrice . . . " There was a portentous pause while Harriet made sure to stake her claim to Beatrice 's full attention . " Bonnets ! She can trim bonnets for Horace and Jonas . She 's all thumbs with a needle , but --  " " Lydia is all thumbs ! " " Annie , on the other hand , has a tremendous gift for trimming bonnets ! She --  " I let out a single stifled bark of merriment . Harriet looked around , startled , but did n't guess where the noise was coming from . I have to say , though , that my sisters ' ventures into the question of what was to become of me had taken an unexpectedly creative and comic turn . It was clear that I would have to make an effort , or I would soon find myself gainfully employed . Below me I saw the top of Annie 's head glide into view , neatly juxtaposed to a large round tray covered with tea things . The severe white parting that ran from the front of that crown to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knife point . " Shh , " said Harriet . " Thank , you my dear . Lovely . " It was a principle of the family that no business was discussed in front of Annie , who was generally considered too innocent to withstand the shock of most topics , though of course not too fragile to be worked to death . They did not invite her to take tea with them , so she set down the things and once again removed herself . " This whole question , " said Alice , " is too much for such a day as this . We 've just buried our dear pa , after all . " " He was a fine-looking man , " said Harriet . " The very picture of a patriarch . " " Mrs. Rowan said he was the fairest creature of either sex she ever saw . She told me that yesterday when she was in buying sugar , " said Beatrice . " ' He cut a wonderful figure . ' Those were her very words . " They all sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
