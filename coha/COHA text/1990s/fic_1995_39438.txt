Ellie found her son in the school nurse 's office , laid out on a leatherette fainting couch like some child gothic , his shoes off , his arms crossed over his chest , his face turned to the wall . " What 's the deal , Kid Cody ? " <p> When he heard her voice , he turned only his head toward her , slowly , as if he were beyond surprise . " I have a stomachache , " he said . <p> " Yeah ? " Ellie sat down beside him and stroked his bare arm . " That 's the message I got . " <p> " It 's a nervous stomachache , Mom . It 's right in the middle . " He pointed to his belt buckle , a nicked metal casting of a race car . " It 's right where Mrs. Schumacher said my nerves are . " <p> Cody was in kindergarten , and he did not like school . He told anyone who would listen that he did not like school . Yesterday , from just inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor Mrs. Schumacher that school gave him a bad feeling behind his stomach , " the kind of feeling , " he said , " that you get before something happens . " Ellie stood still in the doorway and watched as Mrs. Schumacher looked up from grooming one of her half-dozen cats . Mrs. Schumacher was a stringy , wild-haired widow  --  dirt poor , bone thin , and half-crazy with loneliness and neglect . Sometimes when Cody and Ellie would haul trash back to the cans in the alley , she 'd wave and call out her kitchen window to Ellie , " You pull those shoulders back , girl . Divorce is no sin . " Yesterday she picked cat hair out of a long metal comb and told Cody , " There are two kinds of stomachaches , you know . Now a sick one just swirls through your gut like a bad wind , but a nervous one sits real still . " She pressed one gnarled hand to Cody 's belly . " Almost like you 've swallowed a baseball , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one I get at school , " Cody told her . " That 's the one . " <p> After he said it , Ellie pressed her head against the cool storm door and felt sorry for herself , sorry she lived in the only rundown pocket of this suburb on probably the only street for miles where a woman could put her hands on her child and tell him such things . <p> The school nurse , a young , red-haired woman strangely overdressed in a carnation-pink suit , came from behind her desk to the couch . Ellie leaned back as the nurse ran her hand over Cody 's forehead . " He does n't have a fever , as far as I can tell . But he wo n't take the thermometer in his mouth . He says he wants it under the arm . " <p> " Axillary , " Ellie said . " That 's how we do it at home . " <p> Cody lay still under the nurse 's hand . " I told her that , " he said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the nurse said . " You need to try doing it that way at home so it wo n't be new at school . " <p> Cody and Ellie both looked at the nurse , then Cody looked back at the ceiling . " It 's a nervous stomachache , Mom , " he said softly . " I can tell . " <p> " Let 's sit up , Cody , " <p> Ellie said . " You look sicker than you are like that , and lying down is not what you need . A break is what you need . Put your shoes on now . " Ellie stood up and took the nurse 's elbow , led her to a window that looked out over an empty play yard . " He gets nervous , " she said quietly . " It seems to happen most often when too many people treat him like a child The nurse looked at her . " I mean when too many people try to tell him what to do , " Ellie said . " See , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dad in their house and half his time with me in ours . So he 's accustomed to partnership , you know , to being <p> partner in his own management . I mean , you live alone with a child , and there 's none of that usual ' us versus him ' kind of thing . <p> You live alone with a child , and he 's part of the us . " <p> " Oh , " the nurse said . She took a step back . People often did that when they learned how Cody lived . A social worker , new to their city from California , had concocted the scheme during the divorce . To Ellie and her ex-husband , it had sounded humane , but Ellie and her ex-husband did not live in California . They lived in an old and mostly refined Midwestern suburb , a place where tall trees and wide driveways led back behind big houses to double and triple garages . " I 'm wondering , " the nurse said , " if I have the correct home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I called . " She looked Ellie in he eye , insinuating now . " I think I woke him up . " <p> " That 's my brother . He 's been staying with us to help out . " Disappointed in herself for revealing more of their life than was necessary to this woman , Ellie added , " I 'm sure you did wake him up . He 's ill today . " <p> Cody looked up from struggling with his shoelaces . " Uncle Frank is a night person , " he said . " When I 'm asleep , he 's awake . He does life the opposite . " <p> Ellie smiled at him and looked back at the nurse " Frank works nights , is what he means . " The nurse 's face said that even this fact made her suspicious . " Look , I think Cody just needs extra time is all , " Ellie said . " This is his first year of school . He did n't go the play group and preschool route . His father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us still being there for him , even though it was in different houses . He 's fine about that , but he 's no wise guy when it comes to school . Are you , Cody ? " <p> Cody stood up and smiled . " I get stomachaches , " he said . Both his shoes tied , he was ready to go now . Ellie saw that he believed the hard part of this day was behind him . Next to her , the nurse narrowed her eyes at his sudden good humor , and Ellie felt her hesitate , weighing for a moment whether Cody was a liar or only a new and distinct form of damaged child . Then she looked at Ellie , and Ellie saw that what the nurse had decided was that Cody was an odd child , that he was an ill-equipped child  --  a child with a strange and probably damaged life  --  and probably , Ellie understood the nurse was thinking , probably it was Ellie 's fault . They stared at each other a moment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll just take him now . We 'll just be on our way . We 'll try school again tomorrow , right , Cody ? " <p> " Okay , " he said . <p> " You have to sign him out . " The nurse pointed to a binder on her desk . " For our records . " <p> " Right , " Ellie said . " No problem . " <p> They drove away slowly from the school . Cody rolled the window down and rested his head on the doorframe so that the wind lifted his hair off his forehead . Ellie did n't know if he was pensive or only relieved . Maybe he had sensed what the nurse thought of her . Or of him . She turned the radio on low . <p> " Do you want to drive by the lake ? " she said . " It 's warm today . We could climb down the rocks to the beach . " The beach was where Cody told Ellie things , where he confided in her . The wide expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , digging a hole one day last spring with a new miniature folding spade , that he had looked up and said , " Do you want to hear something secret ? " <p> " Sure , " Ellie told him , and then he recited , nearly word for word , an ugly desperate argument she and her ex-husband had had just before they gave it all up . He recited it so precisely that the night came back to Ellie . She 'd made a formal dinner in the middle of the week  --  cornish hens stuffed with herbs and rice . A friendly Greek man at the liquor store had helped her choose a nice wine which she served in their wedding crystal . She 'd left the bottle on the table , tucked in a hammered silver ice bucket , while she and her ex-husband said horrible , hurtful things they 'd never said before or since . On the beach that day , Cody recited it all . He paused in his digging and looked up at her . " I was under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see me there . " <p> For a moment , Ellie believed him . Then she remembered another moment , carrying their salad plates to the kitchen , when she 'd been so ashamed she 'd gone back to Cody 's room to check on him . He lay sideways in his youthbed , one foot wedged between the bars . From the doorway she listened to his breathing before she went to his bed and straightened him , sliding his foot from the bars , folding his quilt up over his shoulders . On the beach , she felt the same relief she 'd felt at his door . He 'd been asleep . He 'd slept through it . She watched him dig the hole , throwing sand over his shoulder , hunkering down to his work , and suddenly she was shaken again . <p> " Daddy did n't tell you those things , did he ? Did Daddy tell you those things ? " <p> " No . " He looked up from his digging , a little wary of her . <p> " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> They were both quiet then . He finished his hole and sat back on his heels to admire it . It was deep , the deepest he 'd dug , and he fingered his new shovel lightly . Then he crawled into the hole , tucking his legs up to his chest and folding his arms around them . " Cover me up , Mom , " he said , smiling then . <p> She slid the warm sand over him as he watched her . When the sand covered the tops of his knees , she smoothed it around his chest . He looked up at her . " I did see it , " he said . <p> She took her hands away from him and sat back . " I know , " she said . " I know you did . " <p> Now , in the car , she looked at him . " How about it ? " she asked . <p> " No thanks . I do n't feel like the beach . " <p> " We could try the library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks . " <p> " Well , I need a milkshake . I 'm going to pull into that hot dog stand under the train tracks and have a chocolate shake . " <p> He did n't answer , but Ellie pulled in anyway , and settled him outside under a striped umbrella , where she brought his milkshake out to him . He drank it quickly , tipping his head back , while Ellie looked up at the train platform , where a few late commuters stood next to their briefcases . She was glad now she and Cody were not going anywhere , glad she had taken the rest of the day off when she got the call at the office , glad they could sit here half the morning and then stop at the park if they felt like it . The gift of her child was that , in his presence , life lengthened and uncoiled . Though it was nearly eleven o'clock , this day spread out before them as sweetly as at dawn . <p> " I like ice cream in the morning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had ice cream this early . " <p> " It 's a quiet pleasure Ellie said . " That and the weather . This is the warmest January we 've ever had , I think . " <p> " I remembered this was your day Cody said . " So I told her to call you and not Dad . " <p> Ellie touched his wrist . " You were right . Exactly right . You 're getting very good at this . You 're becoming a big boy . " <p> Cody looked out over the parking lot . The umbrellas rippled in the breeze like sails , and above them late commuters swayed lightly like distant buoys . " I would kick a bad guy in the stomach if he came near our table . " <p> " That would do it , " Ellie said . <p> " I 'd karate-kick him in the stomach and then in the knee . " <p> " He 'd go limping off to the other side of the world , " Ellie said . <p> This was something new for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her child 's sense of himself as a warrior and her quiet affirmation . School had forced Ellie to see how divorce had changed her  --  that she had become a cautious person , a person who lived as if she were allowed only one mistake in life and had already made it  --  and school had forced her to see that she was sending her son off into the world with the rigid moral sense of a saint . He 'd see a child steal another child 's hat in the play yard , and he 'd suffer it all day . When he came home , he 'd tell her the story of the theft and then lie on the rug , exhausted , looking up at her to say , " That was a terrible thing , do n't you think , Mom ? Do n't you think that was an awful thing to do ? "  --  as if he 'd witnessed a murder . So now she let Cody talk this way , imagining his own power , and lately she had begun to surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavemen as <p> way of making up for all the early years she 'd encouraged a pristine sensibility . <p> " Cody , did anything happen today ? I mean , before you went to the nurse with a stomachache ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Nothing ? " <p> " Well , the playground lady made me take a time-out . " <p> " Why was that ? " <p> " I was swinging on my belly . " <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> " And that 's all . He rolled the edge of his cup around one finger . " There 's a rule against swinging on your belly . " <p> " I did n't know that . " <p> " I did n't know that , either , but the lady said that now I would know and now I would remember . " <p> " Oh . Well , I guess she 's the boss . " <p> " She is . " <p> Ellie ran her hand along the rough close-cropped hair at the nape of his neck . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So then what happened ? " <p> " I had to sit on the ground by her feet for a while and then I had to say I was sorry . " <p> " Did you ? <p> " Yes . " <p> " And then what ? " <p> " Then she called me Cory and told me I could go . " <p> " She called you by the wrong name . " <p> " Uh-huh . Yes . " <p> " Did you tell her ? " <p> " No . " He leaned against her then and tilted his head back to look into her face . " I did n't want her to know me by my right name , Mom . " <p> She put one arm lightly around his shoulders and rested her chin on the top of his head . " What should we do now ? " she said softly . <p> " Go home . " <p> At home , Frank was on the couch , an afghan pulled over his legs , watching the noon news . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up . " You 're home early . " <p> Cody quieted when he said it . He dropped his knapsack under the hat rack , pulled out his box of dinosaurs and cavemen , and began to arrange them delicately , as though he were being watched . Frank raised his eyebrows at Ellie . She shook her head . <p> " I guess I 'll make soup or something , " she said . <p> A few minutes later , Frank joined her in the kitchen . He moved stiffly to the sink , leaned there a moment , then drew a glass of water from the tap and sat down at the table . <p> " It 's vegetable soup . Ellie turned from the pot on the stove . " Can you tolerate it ? " <p> " Not today . " He raised his glass . " Today I 'm drinking water . " <p> Frank suffered from colitis  --  at least that 's what he said it was . He 'd been a medic in the Army and learned just enough about medicine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd been so sick that Ellie had convinced him to let her drive him to the VA hospital for some tests . Nudged into a pocket of darkness between two high-rise office buildings , the hospital was a spooky place  --  cavernous and forbidding and full of old and middle-aged men shuffling the hallways in paper slippers . " This is awful , " Ellie whispered to Frank as they stood in some line . " Why do n't you get real health insurance ? " <p> " Forger it , " Frank said . " I spent three years of my life defending the Golden Gate Bridge to earn this . " She noticed as he walked away from her that day , and again this morning as he came into the kitchen , that he had begun to look like those men at the VA . He 'd begun to look like a damaged man . Though he was tall and thick with muscle , he carried himself lightly , his arms held away from his body , as though he were hollow . Today his rumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a white translucent spot of pain . " You look pale , Frank . " <p> " I feel pale . " <p> " Did you call on your test results ? " <p> " They said they 'd call me . " <p> " You should check . " <p> " They said they would call , Ellie . " <p> She turned back to the stove and then shouted , " Soup in twenty minutes , Cody . " <p> " And biscuits , please , " he shouted back . <p> " Okay , and biscuits . " She peered into the refrigerator , looking for the plastic container of dough . <p> " That is not a sick child , " Frank said . <p> " He was nervous . Something happened on the playground . " <p> Ellie went about her work quietly , spreading flour on the countertop , rolling out the dough , but she felt like Cody had looked in the other room a moment ago . She felt like she was being watched . Frank sat at the table , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an odd man . There was such power to him , in his hands and legs and the set of his jaw , but around other people  --  even Ellie and Cody  --  he was always quiet and watchful , slightly ill at ease . Ellie believed that life  --  real life , life in society , whatever it was she was living  --  was a confusion to Frank . She was n't sure why . Sometimes she blamed the Army . Frank had been one of the last men drafted into Vietnam . Though the war ended not long after he finished basic , the Army had changed him  --  perhaps in ways worse than a year fighting in the jungle might have changed him . She did n't know . She was n't even sure exactly what he had done during those years or what had been done to him . Occasionally , he 'd written to Ellie of demotions , restrictions , extra duty , a few short stays in the brig . She had tried to imagine what circumstances could have landed her brother in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been cock-sure and strong-willed , and sometimes he 'd had a smart mouth , but all boys had seemed like that to Ellie back then . <p> When the war ended , Frank wrote again to say that he was ad , but for an odd reason . If he 'd gone to war , he 'd written , his resistance might have become inflated even in his own mind into some kind of grand refusal . He might have gone the rest of his life thinking that what he had learned was that he could not kill anyone or that a big country should keep its nose out of a little country 's affairs . Then he would have missed what he said was the only real lesson of the Army , which was that people who tell you what to do  --  no matter what reasons they claim  --  are performing an act of aggression . You 're in their way , is what Frank had written to her ; they 'd just as soon you die . <p> When he was discharged , he roamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  crewing sailboats to New Zealand , working illegal shrimp boats out of Key West , leading tourists across the Yucatan Peninsula . For fifteen years he lived like that , never settling long enough for anyone or anything to impose itself upon him . That he came when she needed him had surprised her  --  though both their parents had died and there was no one else to help her . Frank spotted her first at the airport , and when she recognized him , it was by the easy certain smile she remembered . When she came close , though , he stepped lightly away from her . He shook her hand first and then he shook Cody 's . <p> The nature of his support was also a surprise . He said very little , never entered into the acrimony of her divorce , never said more to her son than a benevolent stranger might say . He simply sat nearby while she found a job , a place to live , a car , while she went about the business of solving her life , and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , he left two one-hundred dollar bills folded under an old candy dish of their mother 's . <p> Only once , just after he arrived , while they sat next to each other on a commuter train bringing them back from the courtroom where she had been ordered to sell her home , had he spoken up . " You 're getting screwed , " he told her . <p> " I know . " <p> " You 're just standing there letting it happen . " <p> " It 's worse if you make a fuss . I tried that once and even my own attorney yelled at me . You 're just supposed to stand there and take it . It 's all a glorified trip to the principal 's office . " She looked out the window when she said it . <p> " You 're nuts . You 're only seeing what 's in front of you . " When she did n't turn around , he leaned closer to her and lowered his voice . " For what you 'll end up paying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once stayed at in Bali . It 's real popular with the Australians , but far enough away that you 'd never be found . Cody could grow up knowing how to catch his own dinner . <p> Still looking out the window , she considered it . She could take a few books , a bag of mementos , and her son , and disappear into a tropical life of light , loose clothing , modest shelter , balmy breezes . She turned to Frank . Perhaps this was how he had solved his life  --  not so much by running away from danger as by following closely the slender path of peace . " It 's against the law , " she said . <p> He shook his head . " If you 're not careful , that 's the law you 're going to leave your kid . You have a choice , you know . " <p> Ellie looked out the window again . Maybe she had never known she had a choice . She was a woman , a divorced mother of a young child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity and ultimatum , not choice . But Frank was different , and she realized that his time in the Army most likely marked the beginning of a deal he 'd struck with himself , because since those years ended , she could not name one thing he had done that he had not chosen to do . She turned to face him again . " I ca n't do it , Frank . " <p> He looked at her then with the same expression she had seen flash over him in the courtroom earlier that day . His face became blank and quizzical as an aborigine 's . As he settled back into his seat and looked past her at the city dimming into twilight , she saw something else , too . She saw his resignation . Never would they live together in a tropical guest camp . She had slipped , somehow , away from him . She felt that loss carve out a hole next to the loss of her marriage , her home , the life she had believed would be hers and her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for her , and of her for him , change from hope to regret . <p> Moved suddenly at this memory , she sat down with him at the kitchen table . She felt tears behind her eyes and pressed the palms of her hands against them . " What ? " Frank said . <p> " Nothing . I do n't know . Maybe I should talk with his dad . We could put him in a different school , I guess . " <p> " All schools are the same . " Frank placed his thick hands flat on the table and looked at them . " They 're the same man in a different hat . " <p> " Maybe he 'll get used to it . Maybe it just takes time . " <p> Frank took a small sip of water and then looked to the pot of soup which was boiling too fast on the stove . " Look , " he said . " Why do n't you go back to work ? I 'll watch him . You can work late and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chicken place for dinner and then I 'll get him to bed . " <p> She looked at him , suddenly tired , but acquiescent , too . " Go on , " he said . <p> She worked until past nine that night , leaving for home when lightning from a sudden thunderstorm flickered the lamp at her desk . On the drive home , the rain turned to a fraudulent snow  --  huge wet flakes out of a sentimental movie . She could still hear thunder out over the lake , though , rumbling distantly like doom , and she leaned over the steering wheel , anxious to be home . More and more lately , the thought came to her that in all the world , she had only two blood relatives . In the company of that fact , she felt skittish and threatened , as if two blood relatives were too slender a tie to bind her to the world . <p> The front of the house was dark except for the flicker of the TV in the living room . Frank was asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped to turn off the TV and then saw the slant of light from Cody 's doorway down the hall . <p> " Hey , " she said . He was sitting up in bed with a big book open in his lap . <p> " Uncle Frank felt sick so I 'm reading my own night story . " <p> She came to sit beside him . " That was good of you . But it 's late . Lights out . " <p> " We went to Chicken in a Basket and I got a Coke . A large . That 's why I 'm so awake . " <p> " Still . " She closed his book and slid him down so that his head settled on his pillow . <p> " I saw the snow . Is that why you 're late ? " <p> " I worked extra so I could take you to story hour at the library tomorrow . " <p> " Oh , " he said , already drifting off . Then he opened his eyes . " After dinner , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant ants that hide in the sewer . Have you seen that one ? " <p> " I think so . It 's a scary one . Do n't tell about it now . You 'll have bad dreams . Tell about it in the morning . " <p> He closed his eyes again and rolled on his side to sleep . She stroked his hair off his forehead , and he took her hand and tucked it under his chin . Without opening his eyes , he said , " I 'm going to tell Daddy , too , when I see him , and I 'm going to find out if they have that giant ant movie at the movie store so he can watch it , too <p> " You 're full of plans , " she said , leaning down to kiss him . Before she had sat up again , he was asleep , and he had let go of her hand . <p> In the kitchen she gathered their paper cups and the boxes of chicken bones . At the trash can she stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at four empty beer cans . Drinking was something Frank had chosen not to do in her home . He never used the word alcoholism , but he had asked her when he moved in not to keep liquor in the house . " It distracts me , " he told her . For the first month or so of his time with them , he drank a lot of everything else  --  water , soft drinks , iced tea  --  and he slept a lot . Occasionally , too , he took long hushed phone calls from men Ellie believed must belong to AA or some support group  --  extremely polite , low-voiced men , men she thought of as veterans of another kind . She closed the lid of the trash can and moved to stand by the sink , still holding the chicken boxes and paper cups . <p> Frank came in then from the living room . " What 's up ? " he said when he saw her face . " Is Cody okay ? " <p> She set the trash back on the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Well , why ? I mean , what am I supposed to do now , Frank ? Am I supposed to kick you out ? " <p> " You 're not supposed to kick me out . Jesus , Ellie . You 're supposed to drive me downtown to detox or something . " <p> She sat down at the table , the vision of those men in paper slippers at the VA clanging around in her head . Frank filled a tall glass with water from the tap and sat down across from her . When she looked at him , he straightened his spine and set his shoulders , but his eyes drifted unsteadily . He lowered his head . " What 's going on ? " she asked . <p> " The VA called . " <p> " What is it ? Is it colitis ? " <p> " A long time ago it was probably colitis . " He looked at her . " Now it 's cancer , Ellie . " <p> She put her hand on his . He leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his strict isolation . His hand was still on the table beneath hers . It did not seem fair that he be forced to suffer more isolation . " I 'm sorry , " she said and took her hand away . <p> He shook his head . " It gets worse , " he said , smiling lightly . " They went ahead and scheduled me for more tests and then this clerk called back and told me I do n't qualify for treatment . ' This is not a service-related ailment , ' he told me . ' The VA treats only the indigent and service-related ailments . ' " <p> " You did n't know that ? " she said softly . <p> He rubbed his temples with both hands and pushed his hair roughly away from his face . " No . " <p> " So what this means ... " she began slowly . <p> " What this means is I have cancer and no health insurance . " <p> She sat back in her chair , stunned by the precision of this cruelty . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago tanned and strong , his only weakness that he would not keep track of rules . He had balked even when she suggested he get a driver 's license . She closed her eyes at the memory . She was the reason he 'd come back to this place where his weakness could turn on him so cruelly . " We 'll figure it out , Frank . We 'll figure something out . " <p> " No . No . I 've already done that . I just hate to leave you in a bind . I 've got a little money I was saving to go back to Negril this spring . I 'll leave you some of it and still make out pretty well there myself . " <p> " What are you saying ? " <p> " I 'm saying I 'm going to Negril . " He looked sad for her when he said it , as if he believed she were the one with the greater loss . " I 'll leave in a couple days . " <p> " Frank , my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't just walk away from it . " <p> " I 'm not walking away , Ellie . There are doctors in Negril . I 'm not saying I wo n't take care of it . I 'm just saying I ca n't take care of it here . " <p> He was lying , she thought . He had decided somehow that to die whole on ground he understood would be better than struggling here . She sat rigidly across from him , her mind wildly in search of hope , of a kindly Jamaican doctor down there who would take Frank in and cure him for no more reward than the satisfaction of having preserved such a man . But she had never met a doctor like that . She was n't sure the world was a large and varied enough place to hold even one doctor like that . " How can I stop you , " she said , " from doing this ? " <p> " You ca n't . " He pushed back his chair and stood up . " I 'm tired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He did n't go to bed . For hours she heard his silence as he moved through the house . She wondered if perhaps he was saying goodbye to the house , to its small comforts , but then she understood that he no longer saw her home as a safe place . She was frightened for herself , knowing that . He stood in the kitchen a long time , the house so quiet around him she felt she could hear his resolve building . Then he went into Cody 's room . She sat up in bed and put one foot on the floor , listening until he came out again . <p> When she opened her eyes next , Cody stood at her bedside . " Is it morning ? " he asked . <p> She looked to the window . Outside the snow was gone and the sun shone brightly . " Yes . " <p> " I had a bad dream . I had a dream someone got into our house . " <p> " Uncle Frank was up late last night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed it was someone else . " <p> " It was n't , " she said . " It was Uncle Frank . " <p> They washed and dressed hurriedly , though it was still early . Ellie let Cody watch cartoons as he ate , grateful for the noise and distraction . As they were leaving , she lingered in the quiet front room , looking down the hallway to Frank 's closed door . Cody stood in his coat and hat , watching her . " Let 's go now . " She took his hand . " Time to go . " <p> They were early to Cody 's school , and his teacher looked up surprised from a table in the back of the room , but she came to greet them in the hallway . " A new day and a new start , " she said merrily . Cody reached up to hold on to a corner of Ellie 's jacket . " Today the Green Star group is going to spend the morning at the sand table , " his teacher said to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get started ? " She looked to Ellie . " Cody is in the Green Star group . " <p> Ellie nodded . <p> " I have to tell my mom something , " Cody said . <p> " Well , hurry along . We do n't want to make Mom late for work or whatever . " <p> " Okay , " Cody said , and then stood mute next to Ellie , still clutching her jacket . His teacher watched him for a moment and then went back into the classroom . " Hurry along , " she called . " I 'll take the top off the sand table . " <p> Cody stiffened and began to cry as Ellie slipped his coat off his shoulders . She took his hands , warm with the moist heat of emotion and fear . " What is it you want to tell me , Cody ? " <p> He shook his head , his eyes a little desperate and lost . <p> " You do n't know what it is ? " <p> He shook his head again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you , child , " she said into his ear . Then she drew him away from her . " I think you can do this . I think it 's important that you do this . " He would n't look at her when she said it . <p> Pulling up to the school that afternoon , she saw his face at the door , a bobbing pale moon in the glass that drew an ache up from her own stomach , but he ran down the slope to her car like the other children , trailing his knapsack behind him . " Did it go okay ? " <p> " Yeah . " He closed his door , locked it , and drew the seat belt around him . " At the bad parts , I just pretended I was somewhere else . I pretended it was n't really happening . " <p> They were early to story hour , and Cody hovered near the librarian at her desk , telling her the story of the giant ant movie he had seen . She was a kind older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listened raptly to Cody 's story , then led him off to a far corner of the children 's room . Ellie sat with their coats in a small low chair and watched the other mothers and children arrive . A few minutes later , Cody came running back carrying some books the librarian had found for him . They were junior novelizations of old monster movies : The Mummy , Frankenstein , and King Kong . " Oh , these are too scary for you , Cody . These things even give me the willies . " <p> " Mom , " he said . " She gave them to me . I was going to show them to Uncle Frank . " <p> " Oh . Well , let me see . " She flipped the pages while he leaned against her shoulder . Mainly they were just a collection of black and white stills from the old movies . <p> " Maybe they give you the willies because the monsters are always after a lady Cody pointed to a picture of the Mummy carrying a woman into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , closing the book . " I do n't know . " <p> " Could I show them to Uncle Frank ? They wo n't scare him , I bet . " <p> " Sure , " she said . " I guess . " <p> He crawled into her lap then , and Ellie watched the preparations for story hour while Cody paged through his books . " I read the sign , " Ellie said . " Today is a special puppet show for Martin Luther King 's birthday . " <p> " Our teacher told us about him in school . " <p> " I 'm glad . He was a good brave man . " <p> " Once nothing was fair for brown-skinned people . " <p> " Martin Luther King changed some of that , though . " <p> Cody turned around and looked at her . " He got killed , " he said . <p> " I know . I was a girl . It was very sad . " <p> Cody leaned back against her then and fingered his monster books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be tired , but then she felt heat move out of him , the same heat she had felt in his hands that morning . She turned him around in her lap . " What 's wrong , Cody ? " He shook his head , and she remembered this morning , how he had wanted to tell her something he did n't know . " What is it ? " <p> " Do n't tell Daddy , " he said . <p> He had never spoken those words to her before . Perhaps because of the way he lived or perhaps because of his own good nature , Cody had always been unstintingly fair in his attachments to each of his parents . " I do n't know , " Ellie said . " Why not Daddy ? " <p> " It 's not a man 's secret . " <p> " It 's a woman 's secret ? " <p> " Uh-huh . I think so . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " I 'm afraid about dying . Do you just fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After he said it , she pulled him close . Children did this , she had read somewhere , picked up the unspoken cues and terror in their homes . " It does n't hurt , " she told him . " It stops all the hurt . " She drew her hand across his forehead . " It feels like this , " she said . <p> She knew when she said it that something was terribly wrong with her . To portray death to her own child as more dignified and easeful than life was some sort of abomination larger than she could fathom . But she did not take it back . She rocked Cody gently as the librarian rang a small bell and called for the children to gather around the puppet theater . She sat blankly , Cody curled against her , as the show began with a cardboard cutout of a strictly segregated bus  --  a cluster of white circles at the front , a cluster of black circles at the back . Before Rosa Parks , the caption under the bus read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired and believed she had as much right to sit down and rest as anyone else . <p> It 's a woman 's secret , Ellie thought . This was what her son believed . How he must have wondered to find a woman 's secret in his own mind , to understand that to the teeming power and circumstance of the world he would lose many things  --  one day even his life . Cody 's head lolled against her shoulder . She realized he was asleep in her arms . The monster books slid out of his hands , and she held them a moment , looking into the shy , quizzical pain on King Kong 's face . She shook Cody lightly . " We have to go , " she said . " We have to hurry . " <p> At home , Frank was on the couch in front of the news . He smiled briefly when they came in , then looked back at the television . Cody ran to him with the monster books . He wanted Frank to read them to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the news is over , I 'll read all three . " <p> While Ellie hung up their coats , Cody eased himself onto the couch next to Frank and sat stiffly next to him , thumping his feet against the cushion . Frank lay one hand on his knee to quiet him . An old newsreel of Martin Luther King 's last speech was playing on the TV . " I saw him at the library , " Cody said . " A picture of him . It 's his birthday . " <p> " Monday , " Frank said . <p> " My friend Bennie 's dad is off work Monday , and Bennie does n't have school , but I do . " <p> " How come you have school ? I thought everyone was off , " Frank said . " It 's a holiday . " <p> Cody was quiet then , and Ellie saw that he was a little teary , blinking and looking away from Frank to the TV . " I do n't know , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee gently . " Well , that stinks , " he said , smiling . " That 's not fair . " He shook his knee more roughly until Cody began to smile , too , and then he leaned close to him . " Just do n't go , " Frank said . " Stay home . " <p> Cody looked at him . Ellie could see that Cody had not considered that an option before , that he had never completely understood he had an option before , and next she knew he was going to look to her . She turned away quickly to the front window , afraid to watch the idea of freedom dawn in her son 's face , but outside in the evening sky growing up at the end of her block , she saw it anyway  --  the sudden knowledge loose in his mind , spreading like the shadows that spilled from under stoops , crawled across lawns , and bloomed up from the dark center of even her own scraggly hedgerow . Her son was free . Behind her , music signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew she should turn around , start on dinner , but she stood a moment longer , staring out at the dark , and felt rising in her own mind the strangest and most fearsome comfort . <p>
