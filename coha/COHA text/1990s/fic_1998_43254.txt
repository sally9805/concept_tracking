The organist pumped out the blurred tones of " Just as I Am , " the song sinking like a rusted hook in Jack 's chest . Jack locked his ankles , clenched his knees to the underside of the slick oak pew as his grandfather , Emmett , snored quietly beside him . Stop it . Please stop it , Jack said to the whirling in his body . He stiffened , as if he might somehow bolt himself in place . His grandmother , Ruby ; his aunt Agnes , Miss Abigail , the whole choir launched into the second verse <p> Just as I am , and waiting not <p> To rid my soul of one dark blot , <p> To Thee whose blood can cleanse-each spot <p> O Lamb of God , I come ! I come ! <p> And you were supposed to come then , to rise and walk straight down the aisle and let the blot be washed away by the blood of Jesus . Nine years old was old enough . Jack had seen **25;930;TOOLONG already born again . Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the girls had been from up in Illinois , and tall for their ages . The washing of blood and the rinsing of baptism . And there you were-clean as a dish in a cupboard . <p> Jack held on to his pew . He looked up at the choir , and though they were dressed in robes like apostles or angels , their garments as slick and bright as Christmas ornaments , he tried to keep them who they really were : his overpowdered aunt Agnes , who shook his hand like a politician and wore an asfidity bag to ward off illness ; his own grandmother , who would stand at his bedroom door that very evening . Night-night , Ruby would say , just as his mother had said before she died . Off to the Land of Nod , his mother 's words coming from his grandmother 's shadow at the door , and then the door closing and him falling asleep to the muffled sounds of TV gunfire . <p> As the choir repeated the verses , Brother Dannon descended from the pulpit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the invitational hymn . Since it was Easter , there were pots of white lilies lined up around the altar rail-tall , slick , polished-looking flowers . A smaller bouquet sat atop the organ where June Dannon , the preacher 's second wife , fretted and pumped at the keyboards and pedals as if sewing a huge invisible dress . Above the altar and pulpit and tiered choir , the milky portrait of Jesus hung , his face lean and kind with disappointment , his left hand raised in front of his chest like a shy man bidding at an auction . The robes of Jesus were the same purple , like a vein or the inside of a wet rose , as the stage curtains at Jack 's school , Morgan Elementary , the same heavy waves and folds . It was like a wave , the motion inside Jack now , the part right before it crests and falls . In fact , as Brother Dannon stood there between the pots of donated lilies , his arms spread wide as the planks of the cross itself , Jack felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow come apart , the segments of his spine unlocking like soggy puzzle pieces . Behind the preacher , the choir members stood in their robes , a slightly glossier purple than the robes of Jesus . The choir robes were loose , and swept against each other so that at times they appeared as a single rippling garment , or a series of continuous purple waves threatening to drown their inhabitants . It was no use trying to think of the choir members as they existed in their ordinary lives then-beautician , insurance agent , grandmother , mailman . The hymn and the waves of the robes had driven them upward , and in their places now were these holy shapes , shining white hairdos and moving mouths , as if angelic ventriloquists were perched among the rafters . <p> Jack felt a blaze of inner heat that reminded him of the onset of chicken pox . He had stood on his bed , his mother had told him , had cried and whooped like a flamingo . " No more idea who you were than the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a welling pride , like a second fever , at the extravagance of his illness . <p> But the thing inside him was racing now , almost certainly alive . Jack tried to concentrate on something else . He looked at the woman sitting directly in front of him . Where your treasure lies , there will your heart . . . But that was n't the thought he needed . If thine eye be single , the whole body shall be full of light . That seemed closer . It was hard to know which verse of the Bible to aim at a particular part of life . Judge not , consider the lilies , behold the fowls of the air , ye are the light , the salt , knock and it shall be opened-so many of them already stored in Jack 's memory , little holy snippets , oracular phrases and commandments . If thine eye be single seemed fairly pertinent , almost scientific , in fact . If he could just concentrate on one ordinary thing , the steadying light would stream in , the agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches away . From the back she seemed vaguely familiar , like any adult . Her hair was stiff and perfect , done up for Easter tight as a snow cone . He examined the clasp of her necklace and the dark freckle , possibly a mole , between the silver clasp and the neckline of her dress . There was an abrupt snuffle , almost a snort from his sleeping grandfather , but even that did n't help . The thing inside , blot or cleansing spirit , was truly racing now . Whether it was heading into the hymn or away from it , Jack could n't be sure . Could it possibly race both ways ? But that made no more sense than the words of the invitational hymn-O Lamb of God , I come ! I come ! <p> Jack knew it was only poetry , but still , Lamb of God ? Jesus hung in his portrait above the choir , no lamb at all , but more like some kindly bearded lady . <p> In the stained-glass windows , several apostles were moping ; paired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherubim swarmed like bees about the wimpled head of Mary . The colored light from the windows was cast everywhere , not only soldered in the glass , but beamed and scattered in bits and pieces across the floor , altar , and across the blocked shoulders and tilted Easter hats of the congregation . In the middle of all the scattered light , Jack thought for an instant he picked out his grandmother 's quivering alto . It was odd that her voice would be there , in the wrong realm , among colors instead of sounds . Or maybe it was a little of both . He listened , tried to push the drone of basses to one side , the papery sopranos to the other . It was like weeding a garden , he thought , hunting for the rickety flower that would be his grandmother 's voice , that would calm him , help anchor him to the wooden pew . He studied her lips , but it was hard to tell . Ruby 's lips opened and closed from so far away , Jack found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . It did n't help that the hairdo Ruby had come home with the day before shone on her head , gleamed in the church window light like the rose quartz in his empty aquarium . <p> Jack bit down hard on his lower lip to stop the shaking and jittering inside him . He had felt it before , of course , the quivering lure and pull of salvation , even before his mother 's death six months earlier . <p> His mother had been returning from a visit with his father down in Oak Ridge , where he had been transferred to work at the uranium plant . Just four miles from home ( at the funeral , people had seemed fascinated by the number-just four miles ) , from the trailer where she and Jack lived , the jet-black 1961 Impala he had helped his mother pick out slipped or skidded , veered or did n't veer , but somehow managed to miss a downhill curve . The car tumbled down a ragged embankment , and by the time the first farm truck passed , the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-acre of corn stubble . <p> But even before that , Jack had felt the preacher 's eyes upon him in church , felt the blot of his own soul swelling up in his chest like a bull's-eye . Every person was a sinner , and the wages of sin was death . It could n't help but be your fault . And today was even worse . It was Easter now-the stone rolled away , Jesus loose and free as a bird . The woman in front of Jack was no anchor at all , no place to put his heart , to make his eye be single and still . He stared at the mole or freckle on her neck . It was a mole . Would there be others ? On her shoulders ? Her belly ? But even that was no distraction . The woman may as well have been a pane of glass , no more substantial than the translucent Mary in the window . <p> Was n't this the feeling of being saved , then ? The terrible flutter and motion of the Holy Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demons like the ones Jesus cast out of the swine ? Or was it into the swine ? <p> Jack drove a fingernail deep into his palm and held it there as he had at his mother 's funeral . If he could just do that , if he could just hurt himself enough to stay put , to stay Jack . " You have the name of a president now . How about that , Jack ? " his mother had said just after President Kennedy 's election . When he was younger , she had read to him all the stories and poems full of Jacks-Jack Sprat , Jack Horner , Jack and the beanstalk , in-thebox ; Jack be nimble , be quick . Jack , he spoke his name very softly now , like a stifled sneeze . He wanted to say it much louder , to repeat his own name over and over with a sound as sharp and plunging as an arrow . <p> Suddenly , from somewhere in the choir , a soprano launched a wild string of notes . The notes fled north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that seemed to lose its balance and blow crookedly among the rafters of the choir loft . Oddly enough , it was a relief to Jack , even more help than the lip biting . The mistake was embarrassing , yet comical , and Jack felt a small hitch in his fever , a tiny breath of calm , though he was careful to keep a corner of his lower lip tight between his teeth . <p> As Jack searched the faces of the choir for the wayward soprano , a man he had never seen before rushed down the center aisle . Jack turned in time to see him pass . The little man wore a plaid jacket that resembled wrapping paper , a tie as wide as a circus clown 's . He was already weeping ( weeping , not crying , was the word for it ; Jesus wept ) , and when the man reached the altar , Brother Dannon quickly laid a hand on his shoulder , then both hands , as if to keep him from floating away like the false notes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs , and Jack thought suddenly of rusty mechanisms , sorrowful old engines cranked up after long storage . As the weeping continued , Jack wondered if , in spite of the preacher 's hands , the sport coat might actually leap from the man 's shoulders . The mole lady in front of Jack went for her handkerchief , and Jack could hear the unsnapping of purses all around him . <p> Was it the same hook ? The same rusty hook Jack had felt in his own breast now snagged into the little man ? Had the man sensed it hovering , baited with the Easter sermon , had he felt it happening before it happened ? All sermon long , during the part about Jesus thirsty on the cross ( " And who did He thirst for , friends ? " Brother Dannon had asked ) , and the part about the empty sepulcher and the linen garments unoccupied , and during the part about the terrible angel whose countenance was like lightningduring all of it , had the plaid man been sitting , trying desperately to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was exactly what terrified Jack , this tugging and tugging and then the clean outright jerk , and Jack would find himself trembling at the altar , crying like a baby , or weeping like Jesus , the slick smell of lilies and the odor of Brother Dannon 's aftershave and breath mints washing over the straw-like smell of his own panic . It had happened to the plaid man , and it could happen to him . Jack thought of the twins , saved in their identical dresses . He thought of Saul , struck blind and knocked from his horse in the Bible . God 's eye was on the sparrow . His hooks were sweeping down . One minute a boy could be safe , locked in his pew , his grandfather snoring peacefully , unconscious as a clock , and the next minute he would be swept down the worn trail in the aisle carpet like somebody 's bride . Poor Jack who has no mother , the congregation would think in unison , although the absurd thought sprang to mind that they might actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tune of the hymn . <p> That was what the song already wanted , was n't it ? That was what the donated lilies wanted and the pale raised hand in Jesus ' portrait wanted . To reel Jack in , to fish out the blot . To make him lose his grip on himself until a spectacle for Jesus was what he would become , blatant as an Easter egg , repeating whatever vows or promises the plaid man in the jumping coat was now repeating . But at least it would stop then , would n't it ? - the trouble inside , the frantic vacant thing , that , while no longer racing , still rocked and wobbled as if Jack 's heart had been replaced by a spinning jar lid . <p> Jack pressed his fingernail into his palm deep enough to bleed . He did n't care . He hoped it would . Even if he had no mother , he was n't budging , not for any Lamb of God or bearded lady Jesus . He knew it was wrong ; it was stubbornness . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very first one , the one the devil had fallen from . The women 's handkerchiefs daubed and fluttered before their faces now as if they were trying to catch the bits of colored window light . The more they fluttered , the deeper the nail , and the more Jack was n't budging . The choir slogged through the verses of " Just as I Am " as the first rows of the congregation began to file up to the altar to shake hands with the saved man . <p> " Wake up , Grandpa . " Jack nudged his grandfather , then gave him a second jolt , this time with his elbow . " Wake up , church is over , " Jack said , just above a whisper . <p> " Now , then , " his grandfather muttered from his sleep , and raised his hands so that Jack feared he might actually applaud . Instead , he came awake , noticed his hands poised in the air in front of him , studied them briefly , then seemed satisfied , as if they were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The Lord bless you and keep you . . . " Brother Dannon was reciting the benediction . " The Lord make His face to shine upon you . . . " The preacher 's right hand was raised , fingers spread wide . " The Lord lift up His countenance upon you . . . " <p> But the words seemed distant to Jack ; they seemed oddly adrift , almost confectionery , like icing on someone else 's cake . Jack saw his grandfather draw back his cuff and begin winding his wristwatch , an activity that somehow allowed Jack to release his lower lip and even ease the fingernail from his palm . The watch winding made a small crickety sound , a ratcheting of gears so faint it was possibly imaginary among the words of the benediction , the hymn , the creaking and stirring along the pews . <p> Nevertheless , time was back , it seemed , and Jack was in it . In a matter of minutes , his grandfather would offer Brother Dannon a single stiff handshake at the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rambler while Ruby changed from her choir robe . They would pass through the quiet neighborhood of city houses near the church , the Easter sun too bright on everything , almost painful , so that the houses themselves seemed to squint and want to be shadows . There would be the two traffic lights , and then , through a break in the distant tree line , the glimpse of the Ohio River bridge . They would pass the peach orchards already in full bloom , the blossoms a very pale violet , like the sheen inside a mussel shell . And then Mount Moriah , the actual cemetery where Jack 's mother was buried-the older sections , weedy and chaotic , with mossy , tilted angels and rained-away names ; the newer graves with their tidy stones standing at the heads of loaf-like mounds where bluegrass was still trying to grow . There would be the seven slow miles home then , and maybe , probably , no one would utter a word . It did n't matter . <p> Jack sat in his pew and listened to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might even walk up and shake the saved man 's hand , but decided not to press his luck . Maybe there would be a Godly hook or two that could still snag him so close to the altar . He looked over at the stained-glass windows , all the broken colors there . He said his own name very quietly , the way his mother at bedtime would have . He thought of the highway and the rows of peach trees , and suddenly wished he could find , among the colors in the glass , the exact shade of their blossoms . <p>
