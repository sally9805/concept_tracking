<p> A thin veil of sleet rattled against the ranch house windows . <p> Outside , an early March storm howled gleefully , daring the hardy to step up and feel its punch . My husband and his father had taken that dare all day , riding fence and putting down strychnine in the breaks to poison coyotes preying on the sheep and cattle . Now they were seated comfortably with their boots dropped on the wood stove to dry while they waited for supper . I sat nearby , trying not to inhale the steam from the cow manure drying on their boot heels . <p> Being six months pregnant and new to the family , I was n't allowed to cook yet , so I 'd spent my day plugging up cracks in our bedroom and stuffing rags in the broken window just beside our bed . <p> The glass would stay broken until spring , when someone would carry the pane to town and have it matched . The fireplace in our room was blocked , and a weak-sister oil stove was all we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder I braved the manure fumes to sit by the glowing wood stove in the main room . <p> Daddy Jim sat in the light of the good lamp with the Aladdin mantle , mending tack , and Buster continued work on a riding quirt he meant for my birthday . Like most other evenings , it was a quiet , peaceful scene , with muffled rattles and good smells emanating from the kitchen promising plentiful hot food shortly , until old Gregorio ran into the yard shouting that the ewes in the south pasture were lambing and abandoning their newborns . Some rusty old ram had invaded the pasture and bred a whole flock of ewes early , causing them to lamb before they should . <p> Two pairs of boots hit the floor in unison as the menfolk raced for their fleece-lined jackets and heavy gloves . Stetsons securely anchored against the wind , they ran to the barn for their horses without a word to anyone . <p> I 'd been on the ranch less than a year and did n't know the first thing about lambing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew was that a bunch of sweet little lambs and their mamas were out in that cold . True to my nature , I wanted to help . I had n't the least idea how a woman six months pregnant could be of help , but there must be something I could do . Every time I had asked to join the men , I was told , " " Stay by the fire . " Western men had a way of protecting their women without bothering to explain . My help would have been refused again tonight , only I had n't had a chance to ask , and they had n't had a chance to say no <p> Buster 's mother  --  Mama Kate , we called her  --  calmly dished supper back into the pots for whenever the men came back , accepting their abrupt departure without complaint . I suspected that was why so many ranch women cooked pinto beans , baked yams and beaten biscuits : The food might have to keep for a good long spell . In fact , nobody I knew in Borden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were ranching for the war effort . Everyone knew that every calf or lamb that died could have fed an American soldier . <p> I hung around , watching Mama Kate and Grandma York , until it hit me how I could see my first lambing . " " Why do n't I take the pickup and haul coffee to the men so they wo n't have to make shifts back to the house to warm up ? " I asked , bracing for Mama Kate 's refusal . But it never came . Apparently , pioneer women saw nothing wrong in taking comfort to their men , so long as they kept out of the way . My pregnancy was no consideration to this rugged woman . <p> Grandma went to bed , shaking her head , but Mama Kate helped set up some empty milk cans we filled with gallons of coffee . She was as little and scrawny as I was , but between us we wrestled the cans into the bed of the rusty old Dodge pickup , and I set off alone . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drove between the frozen ruts that guided me to the pasture . When I pulled through the gate , I was n't prepared for the sight cast up by the truck 's headlights . The ground was littered with dead lambs and ewes . Those still standing were tail-to-wind , bleating like the lost souls they were . My husband was on the ground , nudging and lifting ewes to stand so they could be driven to shelter , and Daddy Jim , still riding old Vinagaroon , was herding a clutch of ewes that had n't lambed yet to a makeshift cote . <p> Though the lambs were slick and dirty , in my eyes they were Mary 's little lambs , with fleece as white as snow . I was ignorant then of the rancher 's calm acceptance of nature 's cruelties . <p> Acceptable loss was a concept I could n't handle at 18 . I wanted to save those baby lambs . My anger and indignation built as I watched the men piling small corpses beside dead ewes against the barbed wire fence . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock . I would put them in the back of the pickup and ferry them to the house where it was warm . <p> I lowered the window as Daddy Jim rode up to the lee side of the truck . All I could see of his round , ruddy face through the slit between his Stetson brim and his high-collared sheepskin coat was a pair of direct blue eyes , staring down at me from 16 hands up . When I told him what I planned , he sat there for a moment , then waved my husband over . When I repeated my offer to Buster , he looked at me kind of pityingly and lifted one scrawny lamb into the floorboard of the truck . " " She 'll have to do , " he said . Satisfied with my husband 's handling of the matter , Daddy Jim rode off , and Buster turned back to punching up ewes . <p> Considerably cheered , I drove away with the pitifully bleating lamb in the floorboard . Saving one lamb was better than none . <p> As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby blanket from a stack I was saving for my own baby , due in June , and raced back to wrap Rebecca snugly in its folds . ( Yes , I 'd already named the lamb . ) Then I scared up a cardboard box and made a bed in the power house , where we kept the Delco battery when the windmill was out of whack or out of wind . It was n't warm in there , but it provided makeshift shelter , since Mama Kate staunchly refused to allow the lamb into her kitchen . She 'd never let " " critters " into her kitchen before , and she would n't start now . She did , however , let me dip some blue milk that had already had its cream skimmed off to feed Becky from a baby bottle in my layette . ( She and I were very close by now . ) Even though I had only one lamb to care for , I 'd saved it , and I felt good ! <p> Next morning I hurried to the power house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , I found Daddy Jim , grim-faced , staring at the box . At first I thought he was mad at me for taking over the power house ; then , looking past him , one glance told me the lamb was stone-cold dead . She 'd struggled free of her blanket , and one tiny leg stood straight up in the air , as though she 'd tried to escape the confines of the box . Daddy Jim must have seen my shocked expression , but his eyes never flickered . All he said was , " " Four-legged animals have to stay on their feet to live . " Then he left me to deal with the frozen lamb . Without a word , Buster came along and picked up the box and took it away . <p> Angry tears streamed down my face . Why had n't he told me to let the lamb stand up ? He must have known that the lamb would n't make it . How could anyone be so cruel ? Later , I learned it was his way of telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , I 'd have to learn the age-old adage of the plains : When nature takes , you give , and when nature gives , you thank God . But right then , I felt both stupid and betrayed . <p> Next day I saw where my husband had buried the lamb in a draw not far from the house . He 'd even stuck a small stick in the ground above the grave so I could find it . He could have burned it with the rest , but he had n't . It was the only indication he gave that he understood how I felt and was sorry that my first lesson in ranch life had been so hard . <p> After that , I stayed away from calving and lambing and , though it took awhile , I acquired some of my husband 's objectivity toward ranch animals . Besides , I could wrap my own baby snugly and tuck him in a warm crib . He would have only two legs . <p> NOTES : Adelaide W. Ferguson is a free-lance writer in Pearland.
