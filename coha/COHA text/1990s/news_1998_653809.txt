<p> The possible takeover of the American Stock Exchange by the parent of the Nasdaq stock market reflects both the tide of changing technologies and the growing power of big Wall Street brokerage houses to force changes that will save them money . And it follows stock market reforms that have diminished the power of insiders at both markets . <p> If the combination goes through , and it is not certain that it will , it could create a stronger competitor for the New York Stock Exchange , which will remain the leading American market for stocks . The Big Board has proposed relaxing a rule that has made it almost impossible for companies to move from the exchange to other markets , and this move could make the National Association of Securities Dealers , Nasdaq 's parent , better able to compete for such listings . <p> But the immediate impact would be far more important for brokerage firms than for their customers . The firms that sell stocks to investors , both to large institutions and to individual customers , are likely to save money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave two strong , highly competent markets vying for company listings and competing to hold down costs and get better execution of trades for investors . <p> For Wall Street firms , which have been irritated by the costs of running the American Stock Exchange and worried about the costs of updating its systems , there is hope for savings as some computerization projects have shared costs . <p> For the N.A.S.D. , a takeover of the Amex would give it a presence in the growing market for exchange-traded derivative securities , like stock options . Nasdaq has previously tried and failed to get into that market . The Amex would get a source of capital to improve its systems , as well as savings from joint projects with Nasdaq . <p> But while the deal is important to Wall Street , it is less important to most investors , at least in the near future . The Amex and the Nasdaq market would continue to operate much as they have , with technological improvements appearing only slowly . And the two markets would continue to compete for company listings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . <p> Talks between the Amex and the N.A.S.D. began almost a year ago , shortly after Frank G. Zarb became the chairman and chief executive of the N.A.S.D. But it was only in the last four months that they heated up , and it was this week that Amex board members began to be told of the talks in advance of yesterday 's meeting of the Amex board . <p> Mr. Zarb , a veteran Wall Street executive who was brought in after a price-fixing scandal at Nasdaq , is said by people who have talked to him to believe that some kind of an amalgam of the historically different ways of trading  --  Nasdaq 's dealer market on one hand , and the auction markets of exchanges  --  might prove to be the best form of trading as technology evolves in the next century . And the hope is that acquiring the Amex will leave the N.A.S.D. well positioned to compete . <p> John Tognino , president of the Securities Traders Association , which represents about 8,000 individuals in the securities business , said the N.A.S.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of newer smaller companies , and an auction market , which is attractive to larger , more mature companies and which is more familiar to foreign companies . " The U.S. marketplace needs both and has to strengthen both to compete globally , " he said . <p> On the Amex side , the lead role was played by Richard F. Syron , the chairman and the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston . The Amex has long been a laggard in the trading of stocks , but has done well in stock options and has been a leader in developing new derivative securities that can trade on exchanges . <p> Some Amex members said yesterday that they expected a merger to generate more equity listings and to increase trading volume . Whether or not more listings materialize , that attitude is just what Amex officials need to sell the merger to its more than 800 members . " I see my business expanding , " said Howard Lasher , president of the Lasher Group , a group of floor brokers who execute trades . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While options trading has proved very profitable for Amex members  --  leading to record prices for the price of a seat , or the right to trade , on the Amex  --  it has not done as much for the exchange itself . Most of its revenues have come from fees paid by vendors of stock quotations like Reuters and Bloomberg for access to real-time stock prices , and the exchange has felt a need for capital to modernize its computers . <p> The plan , according to people briefed on the discussions , is for the N.A.S.D. to control the Amex , but to continue to operate it and Nasdaq as two separate markets , with different lists of stocks available for trading and , to some extent , competing with each other , as well as with the Big Board , to list companies . <p> Nasdaq would remain largely a dealer market , in which many dealers make markets in stocks and there is no central trading area . The Amex would remain an auction market , in which trading in each listed stock is concentrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sell stocks if needed to facilitate transactions . But there would be cross-fertilization between the two systems , whether or not they eventually combine . In the meantime , it is expected that Nasdaq and the Amex would retain their separate listing standards for companies . <p> By having two markets , the N.A.S.D. would be in a position to argue that it could offer either an auction market or a dealer market to any company . That could be important after Rule 500 is changed at the New York Stock Exchange . That rule allows companies to leave the Big Board only if a large majority of shares outstanding approve the action in a shareholder vote . The exchange has proposed making leaving easier , but the N.A.S.D. has complained it will still be too stringent , and the issue is before the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> The possibility of such talks would have been unlikely even a few years ago , in large part because stock markets  --  whether exchanges or Nasdaq  --  were dominated by insiders even though most of the members were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the Amex tried to keep Nasdaq stocks from being automatically eligible for trading in some states , as exchange stocks are . The same firms were effectively paying for lawyers for both sides of the battle , which Nasdaq eventually won . <p> But the S.E.C. , under Arthur Levitt Jr. , has forced all markets to tilt power toward directors outside the securities industry . The Nasdaq market makers have seen their power wither as regulators forced new trading rules that threaten to cut their profits by improving the prices that investors can obtain . Those reforms have in some ways made Nasdaq more like an auction market , although differences remain . <p> To get the deal approved , the Amex will need the backing of its members , who own seats and would be strongly opposed to seeing their value wither . Most of the seats on the Amex are owned by investors who lease them out to the actual traders and brokerage firms that do the work . By contrast , any brokerage firm with sufficient capital and regulatory approval can be a market-maker on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system would endure . But there would be steps taken to protect the value of the seats , which might include the N.A.S.D. 's buying some seats and retiring them , or perhaps payments could be made to all seat owners , according to a participant in the negotiations , who spoke on condition of anonymity . With 661 regular membership seats recently selling for $480,000 apiece and 203 options principal memberships selling for about $450,000 , it would take $400 million to buy them all at current prices . Details on how to compensate seat owners are far from complete , the participant cautioned . <p> Only three years ago the Nasdaq market thought it was riding a winner . It had evolved from the old , and somewhat disreputable , over-the-counter market , where stocks not good enough to be listed on exchanges were traded . But in the quarter-century after it began in 1971 it grew rapidly and was able to promote itself as " the stock market for the next 100 years , " in which its technology presumably supplants the old-fashioned person-to-person trading on exchange floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the country 's most dynamic high-technology companies , including Microsoft and Intel , which once would have moved to the Big Board almost automatically after they became established . <p> But at the heart of the Nasdaq system was not high technology but traders doing business with each other . And it turned out the traders  --  market makers  --  were effectively fixing the prices paid by investors . This was done by keeping the difference between the bid price , at which the market makers would buy a stock , and the asked price , at which they would sell it , artificially large . <p> That scandal , when it broke , led to reforms that are ending the most crucial part of the market-maker system  --  the need for investors to trade with a market maker , rather than directly with other investors . <p> In addition , the Nasdaq market has not been a leader in new financial instruments . The innovation there has come largely on the Chicago futures and options markets , as well as at the Amex . It is not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be . The Big Board was late in invading such markets , and has not been successful . The Amex , by contrast , does a large business selling baskets of stocks  --  such as all the companies in the Standard &; Poor 's index of 500 stocks , or in the Dow Jones industrial average , to individual investors . <p> The Amex has also had its share of embarrassments . A 1950 's scandal , involving specialists who tried to manipulate prices and sell securities that could not legally be sold , almost destroyed the market . And more recently , under the leadership of Jim Jones , a former Congressman who knew far more about Washington than he did about Wall Street , it set up a market to trade small-company stocks that turned out to be a haven for promoters of dubious securities . It was in part to clean up that mess that Mr. Syron was brought in . <p> And in stocks , its small position had led some Wall Street firms to wonder if they really need to maintain a full presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm when they transact business at that exchange . Mr. Syron , said one person who has talked to him , has been assuring firms that he was working on things and asking them to defer taking any precipitate action . Now they know what he had in mind . <p> Chart : " Leading Issues on the Exchanges " Chart shows the leading issues on the exchanges based on market capitalization ( at yesterday 's close ) , and trading volume ( total shares traded in 1997 ) .
