Electronic games like Pac-Man , Tetris , Doom and Myst are the totems of a generation and have etched an indelible imprint on the American psyche . Or so J.C . Herz , the 25-year-old author of Joystick Nation ( Little , Brown ; 230 pages ; $23.95 ) , would have her readers believe . For as Herz sees it , video games are n't just kid stuff ; they are " theme parks of the mind " that reflect the fears , fantasies and desires lurking in every human soul . <P> In her witty manifesto , Herz correlates each major genre of electronic game with an age-old impulse : shoot-'em-ups like Doom tap the primal instinct for survival , while puzzle games like Tetris satisfy the need for order , control and reason . The games ' larger-than-life superheroes are interpreted as contemporary reincarnations of mythological figures like Zeus and Prometheus . <P> But in her zeal to convey the importance of the games , Herz occasionally loses her edge and blindly defends them against all criticism . Her responses to the bimboesque portrayal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to children , for example , feel as shallow as an Aqua-Fresh smile ( a Herzian saying ) . The games ' shameless pandering to adolescent fantasies is explained with little more than a breezy " what teenage boys want , teenage boys get , " while growing parental concern is briskly dismissed as " adults freaking out about their precious darlings being driven to new heights of deviancy by popular media . " <P> Still , Joystick Nation offers more than enough wisdom , humor and insight to make it an engaging treatise on how video games have moved beyond the kiddie arcades and into the cultural fabric of modern society . <P>  --  By Anita Hamilton
