<p> Beneath the masks of merriment , segregation has been part of Mardi Gras from the beginning . White men of the city 's French and English aristocracy started the tradition in 1857 , when the first formal carnival club , the Mystick Krewe of Comus , paraded through the streets . <p> More white-male krewes followed , and eventually blacks , women and homosexuals organized krewes , some of which are open to all . Together yet separately , some 30 krewes and their supporters flood the city 's streets and ballrooms for the unique brand of pre-Lenten debauchery that New Orleanians of all kinds hold dear . <p> But this year , there is trouble . Comus wo n't parade . Nor will the Knights of Momus , another exclusive , all-white-male krewe . The two clubs are protesting the majority black City Council 's passage of an ordinance intended to penalize krewes that discriminate . <p> Carnival will go on , but the withdrawal of the two prestigious krewes and the debate about the ordinance has stirred racial animosity . Residents have been forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decipher the line between free association and unacceptable discrimination . <p> And people who thought the broad-based voters ' coalition that kept a former Ku Klux Klansman from the governorship represented a new level of racial harmony now see that racial divisions abound . <p> Some ordinance opponents call City Council President Dorothy Mae Taylor , who introduced the measure , the villain . She is black . A T-shirt on sale throughout the city depicts Taylor in a tiara and calls her " The wench who stole Mardi Gras . " <p> Although the ordinance , approved Dec. 19 , targets discrimination based on race , sex , national origin and religion , it is the part about race that has riled . And the white krewes are at the center of the controversy . <p> " That 's not to say that we necessarily want to join , but certainly in a country that promotes democratic society we would like to feel free to do so , " said Harry Cantrell , who is black and the president of the Louis A. Martinet Legal Society , which supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as it is about social inclusion , said Ben Edwards , a small businessman and member of the city 's sewage and water board . Access to the elite clubs means access to the city 's movers and shakers . " It 's about money because deals are being cut in those clubs , " said Edwards , who is black . <p> Opponents of the ordinance discount that argument . In the hedonistic theater that is carnival , often accompanied by considerable alcohol consumption , " It 's not an environment for business , " said Errol Laborde , editor of New Orleans magazine and a carnival historian . <p> The krewes are the backbone of carnival , which this year begins on Friday and culminates on Fat Tuesday , March 3 . About 30 krewes will parade here . Scores more will parade in nearby parishes . <p> Their membership , said George Denegre , who was Rex , King of Carnival in 1986 , represents people 's right of free association . Asked if that means the right to discriminate , Denegre , a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wanting what you do n't want . " <p> Denegre  --  who is a member of the krewe of Rex but would not say what other clubs he belongs to  --  said the all-white clubs will not admit blacks because " they do n't want to . You do n't have to have a reason . Why do you eat ice cream ? ' Cause you like it . <p> " The whole theory of the right of association is just that  --  that you have the right to associate with people of your own chosing , which obviously has to imply that you do n't have to have a reason . So , the simple answer is that they 're happy with the way it is . . . It may be that some of them will change . Obviously , times change . The city 's over 60 percent black now . " <p> Black krewes , which also maintain a measure of secrecy about their members and leaders , are far fewer in number , but with traditions that date back to 1870 . The largest black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others , however , are not integrated . <p> Kenneth M. Carter , a member of the small , all-black Young Men of Illinois club and a supporter of the ordinance , said there are no whites in the club because " no whites would be interested , and it 's just like the white clubs in that it 's family and friends . " If whites were invited to join , he said , " They would n't be rejected . " <p> If black clubs discriminate , they too should stop , said the Rev. Zebadee Bridges , leader of the city 's Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance . " Black discrimination is the same as white , " said Bridges , who is black . <p> Membership in many of the clubs is based on family and social ties . In some of the clubs , applications from prospective members are welcome . In the most exclusive clubs , however , membership is by invitation only . The average krewe membership is 200 , but there are " super krewes , " such as Bacchus and Endymion , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient Greek or Egyptian mythology , or from the boastfulness of krewe members  --  Nomtoc , for instance , stands for " New Orleans Most Talked Of Club . " <p> The krewes host costume balls where kings , queens and their courts preside . They usher debutantes into society . They parade and ride on thematic floats , their masked , feathered and sequined revelers tossing doubloons and other trinkets into the crowds . <p> The city supports the private clubs ' activities through regulations dating back to the 1950s and by closing streets and providing the additional police , fire , emergency and cleanup workers needed for the two-week affair . Last year , according to a University of New Orleans study , 1.5 million tourists and locals participated in carnival , bringing the city $ 500 million . <p> Tension over the ordinance has ebbed and flowed since its passage by the seven-member council . The unsolved slashing of two Mardi Gras oil paintings on display at the Hotel Inter-Continental last month fueled concerns for a time that trouble would flare during the carnival parades . Throughout January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ krewes would drop out of the parade schedule . <p> Although many blacks are angered by the krewes ' segregation , that feeling is far from universal . A poll published by the New Orleans Times-Picayune this month found that 51 percent of black residents and 86 percent of white want the ordinance rescinded . And 56 percent of blacks said they also oppose the section of the ordinance that prohibits discrimination at private clubs where business is discussed ; 75 percent of whites opposed that prohibition . <p> The ordinance was intended to bring the city in line with a 1988 Supreme Court ruling that upheld a New York City prohibition of discrimination in private clubs . The trend toward integrating private clubs has included country clubs on the Professional Golfers ' Association tour and private social clubs such as the Cosmos Club in Washington . <p> Protests against an elite all-white-male group in Tampa , Fla. , called Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla , led the way last year for the group to refashion itself as a symbol of diversity and admit black men for the first time ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear how New Orleans ' exclusive white krewes will respond to the challenge . Along with the business community , Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and believers in the merriment of this annual street theater , the krewes successfully pressed the City Council earlier this month to soften the anti-discrimination ordinance . The council removed a provision that would have made jail a penalty for discrimination . They also shifted the burden of proof of discrimination onto the alleged victim rather than the clubs . Council President Taylor 's was the sole vote against softening the measure . <p> Those changes were endorsed by many members of a blue ribbon committee appointed by the council to study the law . That committee is to complete its report by November , when the ordinance may be rewritten or further amended . Some want the ordinance repealed , or at least revised to exempt the krewes from its provisions . <p> In the meantime , the debate continues and Herbert Jahncke Jr . is concerned for his livelihood . <p> " What do my people do while they sit here and debate over this issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Proteus , Hermes and Toth . He employs at various times as many as six artisans . The floats they built for Momus this year will likely be used next year , so a quarter of Jahncke 's 1993 business appears to be gone , he said . <p> Jahncke , who is white , opposes the ordinance . He does n't think government should be involved in krewe membership . Change , he said , is inevitable and ought to be voluntary . He is a member of an all-white-male krewe that he would not name . " I do not consider it as a discriminatory thing , " he said . <p> Although the streets will be clear during the times originally scheduled for parades by Comus and Momus , carnival is about to begin . Hotels are booked as always , said Maureen Detweiler , the city 's special events coordinator . Masked balls already have begun . <p> Many in the business community feared that the racially charged debate about the ordinance would dampen local and tourist enthusiasm for carnival , but Carter said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At least for now .
