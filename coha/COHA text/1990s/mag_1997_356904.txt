The most cautious of the red-tape revolutions has been in the pharmaceutical industry  --  and with good reason . To be sure , speeding up the approval process at the Food and Drug Administration  --  where getting a new drug to market has often felt like swimming through Jell-O  --  is both a worthy and a popular cause . The appetite for free-market trial and error is limited , however , in a business where error has sometimes meant disfigurement or death . " There 's a great push to try to cut down the FDA , " says Fred Dorey of the Bay Area Bioscience Center in Oakland , Calif. , a trade organization for biotechnology firms . " But that 's from people who do n't realize there is a role for government regulation , and it 's not going to go away . " <P> Still , a little de-reg can go a long way , as it has for Peter Johnson , president and CEO of Agouron Pharmaceuticals in La Jolla , Calif . Earlier this year the FDA , using a streamlined process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green light to Viracept , the firm 's new anti-HIV drug . <P> Essentially , the new FDA-process fast track offers conditional approval for appropriate drugs based on clinical trials that are smaller and faster than normal . The agency also allows " rolling submissions , " meaning it will accept and release initial reviews of drug components that are prepared earlier than the rest . For Agouron the difference was startling : the FDA 's review of the Viracept application took a total of only 83 days ; in 1992 the average length of time for FDA drug approval was 19 months . <P> " It took 38 months from the time we first decided to commence development to the time Viracept was approved , and that 's strikingly short , " says Johnson . Drug development took " basically three years , as opposed to an average in the industry that 's closer to eight years or more . " <P> The newly greased skids can improve not only the health of waiting patients but also the firm 's bottom line . Agouron spent the past 12 years pumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research on the technology and procedures later used to bring Viracept to market . Agouron 's net loss last year was $19.5 million , and under normal FDA review , Viracept would still not have been able to earn money for several more years . Under the new rules , however , Agouron can profit immediately from sales of Viracept , which , as one of only four protease inhibitors currently revolutionizing AIDS treatments , is sure to sell well . Viracept could earn $500 million in its first year in the marketplace alone . " We 've essentially been losing money for a dozen years at high rates every year , " Johnson says , " and Viracept is the product that will be responsible for the turnaround . " <P> Though he may make a fortune earlier than originally expected , thanks to the FDA 's fast action , Johnson maintains that new drugs emerging from the biotech industry should be regulated . " I think the only legitimate discussion with regard to regulatory process is whether there is a correct and socially acceptable balance between the urgency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vs. protecting public safety , " he says . " Striking that balance is a matter of public policy , and it 's not a simple debate . "
