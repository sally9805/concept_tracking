Who would expect to find diamonds on the souls of evangelical American missionaries in Zaire ? Situated in the bull's-eye of Africa , Zaire has 43 million citizens scratching out a living on roughly $500 a year apiece . Zaire 's cruel , old-style dictator , Mobutu Sese Seko , however , does not subsist on $500 a year  --  he has many millions stashed away , and right now he makes a decent income off his country 's roughly $300 million-a-year diamond trade . Now , with Mobutu 's permission , Zaire 's diamond business has a new entrant  --  Pat Robertson , the American televangelist and ex-presidential candidate . <P> Backed by the CIA , army general Joseph-Desire Mobutu took over the Republic of the Congo in 1965 and later called himself Mobutu Sese Seko . In 1971 he renamed the country Zaire . Throughout his rule , Mobutu has dealt brutally with opponents , civilian and military . His country 's mineral wealth and location kept Mobutu valuable to Western interests for years , but when the threat of communist expansion disappeared , his worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to yield the throne had led to an economic squeeze of Zaire by three major trading partners  --  the U.S. , France and Belgium . Largesse from lenient banks dried up . Desperately casting a net for new friends , Mobutu found Robertson . Makau Mutua , projects director of the Human Rights Program at the Harvard Law School , says that currently Robertson is Mobutu 's biggest American catch . ' ' <P> The association of dictator and preacher began with a Robertson relief group , Operation Blessing , a branch of which has botched a corn-cultivation project on a 50,000-acre farm outside the capital , Kinshasa . Last year during the Rwandan refugee crisis , Operation Blessing expanded its humanitarian efforts to Goma but was criticized for spending too much money on transportation , pulling its workers out too soon and proselytizing . They were laying on hands , ' ' an American aid worker recalls , speaking in tongues and holding services while people were dying all around . ' ' Many relief agencies are notorious for mismanagement and backbiting , but even considering that , Operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samaritans . <P> Another Robertson organization working in Zaire is the African Development Co . Around the world , Robertson has substantial business interests ( in the U.S. he controls TV 's Family Channel , the Ice Capades and KaloVita , a venture selling vitamins and skin creams from the Holy Land ) , and ADC is a private enterprise formed to look into investments in mining , lumber , agriculture , transportation and power generation , with an eye to plowing the profits back into humanitarian efforts . A nascent diamond-mining operation in Zaire is a project of the ADC . Located on a river southeast of the boomtown of Tshikapa in the heart of Zaire 's diamond country , the project uses state-of-the-art dredges and diving equipment . Robertson is also exploring gold interests on the upper Zaire , or Congo , River , and assessing the hardwood logging potential of four great swaths of rain forest .
