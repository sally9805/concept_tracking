Fresh from the awesome display that won him the 1991 P.G.A . Championship , John Daly got ready to hit a few practice balls last week in preparation for the International tourney at Colorado 's Castle Pines Golf Club . As word spread that he was on the practice tee , a crowd gathered , whistling appreciatively as he casually knocked iron shots into the far reaches of the range . <P> Then he took out his titanium-shafted Cobra driver , and the whistles turned to disbelieving laughter as he started launching balls over the road beyond the driving range . On neighboring tees , pros like Jose Maria Olazabal and Ian Baker-Finch broke off their own practice regimens to watch the ballistic display . A few minutes later Daly headed for the course . His first drive was a monster 364-yd. shot , followed by a 280-yd. 3-iron blast . In short order , Daly turned the 644-yd. , par-5 first hole , the longest on the P.G.A . tour , into an ordinary par 4 . <P> If all Daly had to offer was power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the burly , unassuming 25-year-old with the swing-for- the-fences style is something more : a genuine athletic phenomenon . The man who stunned the best golfers in the world during the P.G.A . Championship at Crooked Stick combined impossibly long tee shots with soft irons , and dead-on putts that left no openings for his rivals . During the final four holes , a stretch when even veteran players get the willies and lose major tournaments , Daly dealt with his mounting nervousness by playing harder . On the final hole of the tournament , he says , he took his biggest swing of the entire competition . It landed in the rough ; Daly salvaged a par 4 . " I came to the P.G.A . tournament with nothing to lose , " he says , " and I think that had everything to do with winning it . " Later , he improved on his spectacular triumph by promising $30,000 of the $230,000 prize to the children of a spectator killed by lightning at the tournament . <P> Daly realized he had talent when he won a junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the former All-America from the University of Arkansas was so disillusioned with his playing that he considered quitting . His fiancee , Betty Fulford , counseled him to stay with it . He joined the P.G.A . tour in March and earned $166,000 before hitting the jackpot last week . <P> In an era when many touring pros act more like accountants than athletes , Daly makes fans remember that golf is a thrilling sport . Rarely pausing for more than a quick glance , Daly plays as though he were being pursued by revenuers . " Sooner or later you 're going to have to hit it anyway , " he says , noting that fast play helps reduce the pressure . His simple philosophy  --  " I just hit it hard as I can , and if I find the ball I hit it again "  --  strikes a responsive chord in galleries . Moreover , Daly is a rarity : a self-made player . He says he learned to hit the ball by watching Jack Nicklaus on TV , by looking at instructional diagrams in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he played on a rural nine-hole course in Dardanelle , Ark.
