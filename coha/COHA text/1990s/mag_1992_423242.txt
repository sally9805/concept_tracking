Tiny Mollusk Invades New York 's Waters . Zebra Mussels : The New Threat . <p> For the past three years , New Yorkers have been bombarded by articles with titles such as these . But now that several years have gone by , what exactly do we know about the zebra mussel ? How is this mollusk affecting New York 's aquatic ecosystems and our lives ? And how is New York dealing with this latest addition to its waters ? Life History <p> The zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha ) is a small , inedible shellfish native to freshwater rivers in the region of the Caspian and Black seas . Adult zebra mussels average one to two inches in length and live up to five years . They get their name from the dark brown stripes on their light tannish shells . <p> Zebra mussels reproduce quickly with mature females producing 30,000 to 40,000 eggs per year . Fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larvae called veligers - a unique feature for a freshwater mussel . Veligers remain free-swimming for eight to 10 days , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lake or stream . <p> At the end of the free-swimming stage , veligers reach the " settling stage " where they attach themselves to virtually any available solid surface . During this first year , the mussels are capable of limited movement such as crawling along the bottom or releasing back into the current . After the first year , adult mussels remain in place for the remainder of their lifespan . Zebra mussels can attach to each other and have been known to form colonies with densities Lip to 100,000 mussels per square meter . How did they get here ? <p> Zebra mussels are believed to have been carried in the ballast water of European vessels which emptied this water into the Great Lakes system . They were first discovered in North America in June 1988 in Lake St Clair  --  the connecting water between Lake Huron and Lake Erie . By late 1989 zebra mussels had spread west into Lake Michigan and east into Lake Erie , Lake Ontario and the St Lawrence River in western New York . <p> Zebra mussels are just one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters via this route . Several other European organisms including the river ruffe ( a small perch-like fish ) , two species of goby ( small fish ) and the spiny water flea have also recently taken up residence in the Great Lakes system . New York Distribution <p> Zebra mussels live in numerous waters across New York State and are being discovered in new locations all the time . At this writing , they are found along all the New York shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie ; the Niagara River ; the western end of the St Lawrence River and the St Lawrence River near Massena ; the Erie Canal from Buffalo to Little Falls ( near Utica ) ; the Genesee River from the Erie Canal north to Lake Ontario ; Oneida Lake ; the Seneca River ; Cayuga and Seneca lakes ; the Oswego River ; the Mohawk River in the areas of Amsterdam and Albany ; and the Hudson River at Albany and from Catskill south to Red Hook . Veligers have been detected in the upper Susquehanna River in Johnson City , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tracking the movement of zebra mussels into and throughout New York 's waters is difficult . Too small to be readily noticed until their second year , the mussels are probably in many more waters across tile state . In addition , by the time individual adults , mussel beds or numbers of veligers are large enough to be detected , a significant population has already been established . For example , zebra mussels found in the Hudson River in spring 1991 had probably already been there for two years  --  based on their size . Beds of smaller , immature mussels probably exist at many other locations throughout the Hudson , but have not been found yet . <p> During the next five years , zebra mussel density will increase and expand throughout the Hudson River and waters connected to the Barge Canal . Other Finger Lakes , the Mohawk River and Lake Champlain are likely sites for zebra mussel infestations because they are interconnected waterways . Waters where zebra mussels are not likely to occur are either deficient in calcium , of low pH or considered too salty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not likely to be impacted . However , even within these areas , some individual waters may have suitable zebra mussel habitat and populations of this mollusk may occur . How are they spread ? <p> Zebra mussels are spread in a number of different ways . During the larval stage , the free-swimming veligers are able to disperse themselves . Larvae can also be inadvertently transported by recreationists in bait buckets , bilge water , live wells on boats , outboard motor cooling passages and on trailer frames . In addition , water droplets carried by ducks , geese , gulls and other waterfowl may also contain the microscopic zebra mussel larvae . Adult zebra mussels can attach themselves to the hulls of vessels . If these vessels move between inland waterbodies within a short enough time frame , adult mussels can survive and reproduce . Adult zebra mussels have also been known to hitch a ride on the backs of mobile animals such as crayfish and turtles . Ecological Impacts <p> When zebra mussels were first discovered in the state 's waterbodies , many New Yorkers panicked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating effects on the present aquatic ecosystems . However , as we have learned more about the zebra mussel , some of these initial concerns have proved to be unfounded . While the introduction of zebra mussels has certainly produced changes ( and will continue to do so until a balance is reached ) in the state 's aquatic ecology , some of these changes may even eventually turn out to be good . <p> Zebra mussels consume microscopic plants ( called phytoplankton ) and organic material particles ( called detritus ) by filtering them from the water . On the average , one adult zebra mussel siphons one liter of water per day . Since phytoplankton and detritus are also consumed by tiny animals called zooplankton which in turn are eaten by small fish and these small fish by larger fish , biologists are concerned that zebra mussels could damage established food chains by removing needed energy from its bottom level . Species higher on the food chain - such as important gamefish - could experience reduced growth and survival . <p> Walleye populations in Lake Erie may suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not shown any such effects to be present . While this is a good sign , it could take several years before any effects on the existing food chain appear . <p> Other types of ecological impacts resulting from the introduction of zebra mussels are also expected . Biologists have already noticed increased concentrations of diving ducks ( which prey on zebra mussels ) in areas of heavy mussel infestation . Certain native freshwater mussel populations are being seriously threatened because zebra mussels are colonizing exposed portions of their shells , which impairs their feeding capability . Some important Great Lakes gamefish populations  --  such as walleye and lake trout  --  could be hurt because of mussel colonization of important spawning shoals . However , no evidence of harmful impacts have been noted . Some other fish species that can prey effectively on zebra mussels  --  such as the freshwater drum and sturgeon  --  may actually benefit and expand in numbers or distribution . <p> Certain ecological changes may be seen by humans as desirable . Filter feeding by zebra mussels may increase water clarity ( as seen on Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , increased water clarity may also result in greater light penetration which could stimulate the growth of rooted aquatic plants . This may be valuable to some fish and wildlife species , but a nuisance to swimmers and boaters . <p> Another positive aspect to zebra mussels is - like all bi-valve mussels - they filter and actually remove harmful metals from the water column . But this poses another problem : fish and wildlife species that eat these mussels accumulate even higher concentrations of the contaminants in their bodies . People who consume any of these game species could then have the contaminants passed on to them . <p> Zebra mussels will affect different lakes in different ways . Most lakes that zebra mussels enter will probably only experience some localized problems - leaving the majority of the lake unaffected . Lakes with muddy or silty bottoms or deep cool lakes like the Finger Lakes have only a small amount of suitable habitat for zebra mussels and will probably only see small areas of intensive colonization . However , even though these mussels take up only a small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonize very visible areas . To the casual observer it may appear as if the whole lake is affected . <p> Whatever the results , aquatic ecosystems colonized by zebra mussels will change . The nature and extent of these changes and how they affect human uses of those ecosystems remain to be seen . Economic Impacts <p> Zebra mussels attach themselves to just about any solid surface including many constructed structures such as buoys , boats , docks and water intake pipes . They can build huge colonies several layers thick in a relatively short period of time , causing problems with these structures . <p> Since zebra mussels prefer moving water , water intake pipes associated with power plants , and industrial and municipal facilities arc especially affected . These pipes present ideal habitat for zebra mussels . They have hard surfaces and tolerable water current speeds that supply ample amounts of food . Zebra mussels settle in water intake structures in great numbers . As their numbers increase , they can block the flow of water in the structures and interfere with the production of electricity , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removing mussels from these structures can be quite high . <p> Aside from water flow reduction , zebra mussels also cause other damage to industrial facilities . Mussel veligers can be drawn into a facility where they settle out within sensitive service and cooling water systems such as those found in drinking water and power utilities . Again , the cost of removing the mussels and preventing their occurrence can be high . <p> Boat owners need to be aware when operating boats on waters containing zebra mussels . The mussels may foul bilge pumps , intakes and motors . In addition , while they will not damage boat hulls , heavy concentrations of zebra mussels can slow speed , affect handling and reduce fuel economy . Boat docks and marinas will also be affected and have to undergo periodic removal of mussel accumulations . <p> Navigation buoys seem to be another favored target for zebra mussel colonization . Some buoys have , in fact , sank from the weight of the zebra mussel accumulations . Frequent inspection and cleaning of these navigation aids is an additional cost for state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> While many individuals would like to see the zebra mussel permanently removed from New York 's waters , the reality is that zebra mussels are here to stay . As such , rather than look for short-term ways to eliminate these small mollusks , we should direct our energies into making wise management decisions regarding their presence . Any solutions we come up with must be aimed at safeguarding both the long-term aquatic environment and the long-term economy . <p> The most serious immediate problem New Yorkers face is in controlling zebra mussel infestation in municipal water supply facilities , power generating stations and industrial facilities . The mussels have been known to reproduce so densely that a facility must shut down and clean them out . New York has already gained experience in controlling zebra mussels in these types of installations by using a variety of methods . While no one method has been proven to be the best , each of the following has been used or tested in New York with mixed results : Filtration eliminates the need for chemicals , but there are installation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infestation ; however , large amounts of chlorine are required to do the job in areas already infested Bromine and Chlorine . Similar to chlorine . May need large dosage Molluscides work well but must be used in precise amounts and detoxified because they also - kill fish and other life . Hot water . Thermal releases of 95 degrees F water for six hours kills most mussels in pipes , but can also kill other life Non-stick coatings and toxic paints help prevent buildup within intake pipes Zebra zappers use large amounts of power to shock mussels <p> There are other control methods for use in installations not yet applied in New York and more and more methods are being discovered all the time . For example , the use of injecting ozone or potassium permanganate in areas of mussel infestation has recently been proven to work . <p> In addition to industries and utilities , boaters and other water recreationists affected by zebra mussels can follow these guidelines to help slow their spread : Do not collect , buy , sell of transport zebra mussels . It is illegal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from an infested lake , canal or river to another body of water . Scrape any mussels off boat hulls and engines . Zebra mussels can be quite small , so inspect closely . Remove all trapped water ( even minute amounts ) in livewells , bilges and engines and allow equipment to dry completely . Use hot water ( at least 140 F ) to flush bilges to remove larvae . Flush engine cooling system with tap water to remove larvae . If shells grow inside , the motor will have to be taken apart . Do not transport live baitfish that are carried in water taken from infested waters . <p> One fact is clear : zebra mussels are a new part of New York State 's ecology . They will have impacts on aquatic ecosystems , public water supplies and water users . But only time will tell the full effects  --  both good and bad  --  that these tiny new inhabitants will have on our lives . <p> Photo : The zebra mussel probably found its way into the Great Lakes System in the ballast water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Resurrected from the bottom of Lake Erie , this automobile is evrusted with zebra mussels .
