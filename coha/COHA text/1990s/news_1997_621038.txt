<p> KAISER NURSES DESERVE A FAIR CONTRACT <p> Editor  --  As a longtime Kaiser member , I am dismayed at the stalling tactics employed by this HMO in negotiating a decent contract with their nurses . <p> For sometime now , Kaiser has been quietly cutting almost 15 percent of Registered Nurses from their staff . A substantial number of nurses have been replaced with medical assistants who are not qualified to do anything more than make a routine appointment , leaving their members hanging on the phone for up to an hour trying to reach an RN . Many RNs who have been with Kaiser for years are now being told that their professional services are worth less with each year of experience . <p> Kaiser recently conducted a mass advertising campaign touting their commitment to providing health care to uninsured children in California . This ad campaign cost a ton of money that would have been better spent in paying their nursing staff a fair and decent wage . <p> Kaiser 's continued stalling in bringing a fair contact to the table is costing us members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unconscionable actions . <p> The place to pare costs is at the administrative level of Kaiser 's corporate structure . I find it impossible to believe that my nurse with 20 years of experience is worth less per hour than my plumber and my auto mechanic . <p> If quality patient care is really the primary focus , it 's time for Kaiser to walk the walk , and stop the talk . Give the nurses a fair and equitable contract and get on with it . <p> ROBIN BRYANT <p> Oakland <p> . <p> ' WHO RUNS THIS TOWN ? ' <p> Editor  --  In the July 15 Chronicle there appeared an item in which Christian Lackner , the leader of the " leaderless " Critical Mass bike mess , informed us that his group needs no permit for a parade , despite the fact that they shut down many streets around them , blocking commuters and innocent Muni passengers . Bikes are alleged to be eco-friendly , but here they are creating pollution from idling cars and buses that wait for the bike parade to pass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and riding the Muni . <p> Who runs this town ? The mayor , or a horde of arrogant , anarchic bike riders with no manners , no identification to finger them , and no insurance , no permit ? Who pays for police overtime , pollution and late commuters ? <p> Solution : the police can lay down strips of wood with carpet tacks in them , at each red light , lifting them for green . Bikes that pass over illegally will have flat tires , and they can take the Muni home , with the angry riders . <p> I live in Berkeley , but work and pay taxes in S.F. <p> ERIK BECKJORD <p> Citizens Against Bike Abuse <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> CYCLISTS ' ARROGANCE <p> Editor  --  Richard Johnson ( Letters , July 15 ) hits it on Critical Mass 's arrogant heads when he brings up the thousands of us taking public transit who were left standing on the curb . Any support the bikers might have received from me was quickly lost as I stood waiting for one of the many Muni vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . Twenty minutes later , the buses were freed and the rest of us were allowed to continue our commutes . Critical Mass 's jeering and shouting as they rode by at those of us not in our cars just shows up their shortsightedness and lack of regard for all others . It does n't seem to really be about car commuters at all . <p> B.J. MALINOWSKI <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> KNOW-NOTHINGS <p> Editor  --  I am writing as a gay teacher in the San Francisco school district . <p> Once again , Christian Fundamentalism rears its ugly head . Clearly , the Trelow 's charges are intended not to protect their child , but prevent any discussion of the mere existence of gay people from occurring in the schools . I remind your readers that absolutely no sexually inappropriate speech occurred ; only the mention of a television show , ( initiated by a student ) , that millions of TV viewers saw . The charges are clearly intended to attack academic freedom and the First Amendment of the Constitution . In attempting to destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprehensible and fascistic . <p> These folks are well connected with right-wingers who wish to push us all back into the closet . Every liberal thinker should speak out against these raging " Know-Nothings , " who are attempting to chill our constitutionally protected rights . <p> VINCE QUACKENBUSH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION <p> Editor  --  The issue of arts funding is not one of finance as there has been precious little money spent on the arts in this country especially in comparison with other civilized nations . <p> The issue is purely one of free speech . Do n't believe for one minute those that want to disassemble the NEA because the country can not afford it and should n't be in the " business " of " supporting entertainment " or that it is being run by " the culturally elite . " <p> The essence of any art form is freedom of expression . This is supposedly the country where that is an inalienable right grant ed us by our forefathers . What more appropriate use of government funding than to support artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constraints of the commercial marketplace where the lowest common denominator becomes the standard and is often mislabeled art . <p> Government money is used for all kinds of things , many of which are extremely dubious in terms of raising the consciousness and spirit of the country . The NEA should not be destroyed but celebrated . The money needs to go directly to the people that make the art , not just the biggest most politically connected bureaucracies . <p> " The life of the arts , far from being an interruption , a distraction in the life of a nation , is close to the center of a nation 's purpose  --  and is a test of the quality of a nation 's civilization . " <p> * John F. Kennedy <p> MEL MARTIN <p> Novato <p> . <p> ARTS AND THE NEW DEAL <p> Editor  --  In his plea to kill the NEA , Mr. Jon Bromfield ( Letters , July 16 ) notes that " the arts flourished in this country before the NEA . " <p> I assume he means the New Deal , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , actors , filmmakers , musicians , and composers to creative work . <p> A current exhibition at the National Archives demonstrates how federal funding sparked a brief American renaissance before Republicans killed it . <p> GRAY BRECHIN <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> MISDIRECTED OUTRAGE <p> Editor  --  Eric Mills ( Chronicle , July 16 ) is getting a little tiresome in his relentless efforts to shut down those Chinatown merchants who sell live animals for food . <p> As a food professional , I am familiar with food processing in this country , and I think he is either terribly naive or disingenuous . The animals that are processed for plastic-wrapped display and sale in our supermarkets are kept in crowded conditions and dispatched violently . <p> If he opposes the consumptions of animal products , he should be consistent in directing his outrage . His exclusive focus on Chinese merchants strikes me as bordering on racism . <p> WILLIAM O. HUGHES <p> Pleasant Hill <p> . <p> LEFTY O'DOUL 'S <p> Editor  --  How can the " Black Sox " sell us out ? A trip to San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our annual Christmas shopping visit to see the store windows and visit Santa was always topped with lunch at Lefty 's . And those few times a year when I accompany my wife to the city for a shopping trip , Lefty O'Doul 's had a place at the bar for me to hide out while she went on her merry shopping way . <p> If Ess Eff no longer wants you , why not move to Danville .
