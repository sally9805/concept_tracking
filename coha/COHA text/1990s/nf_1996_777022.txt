Hello , Young Mothers // Paint Tint Caper  --  September 4 , 1965 // Once . . . just once . . . I 'd like to be dressed for an emergency . // I do n't mean like my grandmother used to warn : " That is not underwear to be hit by a car in . " I mean just to be glued together , so you 're not standing in a hospital hallway in a sweatshirt ( PROPERTY OF NOTRE DAME ATHLETIC DEPT. ) and a pair of bedroom slippers. // In a way , it 's almost as if fate were waging a cruel war and you 're in the middle of it . Not only are you ( a ) bleeding to death , ( b ) grimacing in pain , and ( c ) worried half out of your skull , you are also plagued with the fear that the nurses in East Wing C are passing the hat to adopt you and your family for Thanksgiving . // Take our Paint Tint Caper , for example . Our small son climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm intuitive . I 'm a mother . I sensed something was wrong . His teeth were blue . He had bitten into a tube of paint tint . Now if you 're visualizing some sweet , tousled-hair boy in his fire-engine pajamas , forget it . This kid looked like he was being raised by werewolves ! // In addition to his blue teeth , he was wearing a pair of training pants and his father 's old T-shirt , which caught him loosely around the ankles . This was obviously no time to be proud or to explain that I was a few years behind in the laundry . We rode like the wind to the emergency ward of the hospital , where the doctor checked over his blue teeth so calmly I thought there was something wrong with mine because they were white . // " What kind of paint tint ? " he asked clinically. // " Sky blue , " we said shakily , pointing to the color on his T-shirt . // " I can see that , " he said irritably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // My husband and I stared at each other . Normally , you understand , we do n't let a can of paint into the house until we 've committed the chemical contents and their percentages to memory . This one had escaped us somehow . // While they were pumping his stomach , we took a good look at ourselves . My husband was in a pair of thrown-over-the-chair denims and his pajama top . I was wearing yesterday 's house dress with no belt , no hose , and a scarf around my uncombed hair . I was clutching a dish towel , my only accessory . We looked like a family of Okies who had just stepped into the corridor long enough to get a tin can of water for our boiling radiator . // There are other stories , other dilemmas , but the characters never change . We 're always standing around , unwashed , uncurled , harried , penniless , memory gone , no lipstick , no hose , unmatched shoes , and using the dirtiest cloth in the house to bind our wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't it ? // Birds , Bees and Guppies-January 6 , 1966 // The sex education of a child is pretty important . None of us wants to blow it . // I have a horror of ending up like the woman in the old joke who was asked by her child where he came from and , after she explained all the technical processes in a well-chosen vocabulary , he looked at her intently and said , " I just wondered . Mike came from Hartford , Connecticut . " // I figured I had the problem whipped the day my son took an interest in fish . What better way to explain the beautiful reproduction cycle of life than through the animal kingdom ? We bought two pairs of guppies and a small aquarium . That was our first mistake . We should either have bought four males and a small aquarium , four females and a small aquarium or two pairs and a reservoir . I had heard of population explosions before , but this was ridiculous ! The breakfast conversation ran something like this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea ? " inquired my husband . // " Mrs. Guppy is e-n-c-e-i-n-t-e again , " I 'd spell . // " Put a little salt in the water . That 'll cure anything , " he mumbled . // " Daddy , " said my son , " that means she 's pregnant . " // " Again ! " choked Daddy . " Ca n't we organize an intramural volleyball game in there or something ? " // The first aquarium begat a second aquarium with no relief in sight . " Are you getting anything out of your experiences with guppies ? " I asked delicately one afternoon . // " Oh , yeah , they 're neat , " my son exclaimed enthusiastically . // " I mean , now that you 've watched the male and the female , do you understand the processes that go into the offspring ? Have you noticed the role of the mother in all this ? " // " Yeah , " he said , bright-eyed . " You ought a see her eat her babies . " // We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saltwater and three pairs of seahorses. // " Now , I want you to pay special attention to the female , " I instructed . " The chances are it wo n't take her long to be with child , and perhaps you can even see the birth . " // " The female does n't give birth , Mom , " he explained . " The male seahorse gives birth . " // I felt myself smiling , perhaps anticipating a trend . " Ridiculous , " I said , " females always give birth . " // The male began to take on weight . I thought I saw his ankles swell . He became a mother on the twenty-third of the month . // " That 's pretty interesting , " said my son . " I hope I 'm not a mother when I grow up , but if I am , I hope my kids are born on land . " // I had blown it . I knew I would . // Good Neighbor Policy  --  May 16 , 1966 // Occasionally , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't neighbor . I 'm much too busy to be running in and out , drinking coffee and making small talk with a bunch of women ! " // Well , who would n't prefer making small talk with a bunch of men ! But if I have to compromise , I 'll take neighbors . If it had n't been for neighbors , I 'd have flunked my ink blot tests years ago ! // When the children were quite small we moved into a new house that was rather isolated . ( Rather isolated ! These people had never seen a wheel until we unpacked the kids ' tricycles . ) After three days of explaining to a five-year-old why birds do n't get electrocuted when they sit on telephone wires , watching a three-year-old eat egg yolks with his fingers and listening to a three-month-old cry around the clock , I was ready to chuck the whole mess and trade them all for a ride in a shiny new car with a vanilla salesman . // Enter my first neighbor  --  a woman who spoke in complete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who only cried at weddings . I could n't help myself . In a dramatic gesture , I bolted the door and threw my body across it to prevent her exit . She understood . // Since then , I 've had some winners and some losers . ( I had one who would have borrowed my eyeballs if they had fit into a cup and survived the trip across the lawn . ) If I were to make a composite of the perfect neighbor , I 'd have to list a good neighbor as one who : // 1 . Does n't call you up and ask you why your son wants to borrow 30 pounds of cement . Just says " No ! " and calls the police . // 2 . Does n't whip in and out of your utility room like Doris Day just to tell you your bleach is weak and your laundry second-rate. // 3 . Does n't snicker when you unpack eight bags of groceries , then borrow coffee , butter and potatoes for your dinner . // 4 . Does n't sulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables and silverware for a party to which she has n't been invited . // 5 . Does n't feel she has the right to comment on your relatives just because she hears about them from you four hours out of every day . // 6 . Does n't deny she knows you well enough to write a bestselling novel about you but not well enough to walk into your house without knocking . // Yes , sir , you show me a woman who does n't neighbor  --  and I 'll show you a woman who gets talked about by the ones who do ! // Waking Up Momma  --  July 4 , 1966 // How I am awakened in the morning usually determines how I feel the rest of the day . // When allowed to wake up in the natural way , I find myself quite civil and reasonable to cope with the routine . When the children do the job for me , I awake surly , uncommunicative and tire easily . ( I once fell asleep while I was having my tooth filled. ) // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children line up at my bedside and stare at me as if I 'm a white whale that has been washed onto the beach . // " I think she hears us . Her eyelids fluttered . " // " Wait till she turns over , then everybody cough . " // " Get him out of here . " // " She 's pulling the covers over her ears . Start coughing . " // I do n't know how long it will be before one of them discovers that by taking my pulse they will be able to figure out by its rapid beat if I am faking or not . But it will come . // When they were smaller , they were even less subtle . They would stick their wet fingers in the openings of my face and whisper , " You awake yet ? " Or good old Daddy would simply heave a flannel-wrapped bundle at me and say , " Here 's Mommy 's little boy . " ( Any mother with half a skull knows that when Daddy 's little boy becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wet he 's treading water ! ) // The imagination of children never fails to stagger me . Once they put a hamster on my chest , and when I bolted upright ( my throat muscles paralyzed with fright ) they asked , " Do you have any alcohol for the chemistry set ? " // Probably the most unnerving eye-opener was a couple of weeks ago , when my eyes popped open without the slightest provocation . " Those rotten kids have done it again , " I grumbled . " How can I sleep with that infernal quiet ? The last time it was this quiet they were eating cereal on the front lawn in raggy pajamas . " I hurried to find them . // I found them in the kitchen intent on their cereal . No noise . No nonsense . " Go back to bed , " they yelled . " We wo n't want any lunch until nine-thirty or so . " // It was going to be another one of those days . // When Last Child Goes to School  --  September 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern-day terrorism is the woman who asks , " What are you going to do with yourself when all your children are in school ? " // They go on to paint a dismal picture of the lonely mother who plucks a pair of sticky socks off the ceiling and sobs uncontrollably into them , " My baby ! My baby ! " A woman who wanders through the house , unfulfilled and fighting bravely against the realization that she 's being replaced by a 35-cent plate lunch and a woman she 'd like to sue for alienation of affection . A disillusioned woman without purpose who must fill her time somehow until the big yellow bus deposits her brood at the curb so she can once again run and fetch ! // For many a woman , this will be a rather accurate prediction . She 's the woman who did n't have many interests going for her in the first place . When the children came along , it was the answer to her problem . Here was her crutch , her ace in the hole , her reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversions , meet new friends , put up her hair , read a book or function as a woman . She wore her children like a hair shirt and told everyone how they depended upon her  --  when it was the other way around . // To most women , however , the school bell will sound as glorious as VE Day . It 's over . She 's done it . She is back to some semblance of a schedule , some precious time to herself . She wanted children too , but for another reason . They fulfilled a strong desire to love , raise and leave as a legacy another human being . But they did n't fulfill her ambitions , her struggle for individuality or her need to make a contribution to this life , no matter how small . // I have seen women emerge like great beautiful butterflies from a cocoon existence that was limited to naps and peanut butter . I have seen them assume leadership , develop and grow into active citizens , unearth artful talents that surprised everyone  --  even themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set about restoring their own personal appearance . // I have also seen them sink into despondency , scrub the kitchen twice a week to pass the time and mechanically mouth the same old routine , " I ca n't . . . ( name anything ) . I 've got the children . " // From a woman who has lived through the " last one into school " bit , may I give you a piece of advice . Allow yourself the luxury of that one last look as he waves goodbye from the bus . Pour yourself a cup of coffee and have a good cry for at least five minutes . Then , if you have n't suffered enough , walk slowly through the house and let the quiet pound at your eardrums . If you like , enjoy a round of guilt complex . ( " Why was I so rotten to him all summer ? " ) // Now , straighten your shoulders , take a deep breath and look out of your window . There 's a big world out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surviving Motherhood  --  September 1966 // I have discovered that one of the rich rewards of motherhood is casting maledictions on your children in the event they become parents . It 's a unique way of saying , " Just wait , kid . . . you 're gon na get yours . " // One of my earliest recollections of this tribal custom dates back to my childhood when one day I was nailed in the act of throwing mud balls at Mother 's corset flapping on the clothesline. // Enraged , my mother shook her fists at me and yelled , " May all your children have ingrown toenails ! " Observing that did n't shake me , she added a bonus . " And may your tears be so salty you spit brine for a week ! " // I 'm not saying I fully comprehended all this , but from her tone I sensed she was n't wishing me a happy birthday . I noticed Grandma talked this way too . Sometimes when Mother had had a bad day Grandma would smile , rather pleased with herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you made your bed of thorns , you 'd have to walk through it in your bare feet . " // Or when she really wanted to sink Mother , she 'd say , " Did n't I predict that lip of yours would grow so long you 'd have to take a tuck in it ? " // Throughout childhood , the words of wisdom continued to flow until I felt like I was living with a couple of hollow-eyed gypsies . Words of encouragement , like " May you have a wart on your nose on your wedding day and heartburn on your honeymoon . " Or , " Take care , missy , little girls who sass their mothers live to see their best friends chalk dirty words on their tombstones . " // None of this made much sense until I had children of my own . Now , casting curses on my children is a way of life . It 's the most comforting way I know to get rid of all my anxieties , hostilities and frustrations . // And the beauty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . // I have one that 's a real teaser . I just drop my shoulders , let my arms fall limp to my sides and nod my head tiredly . I do n't say anything at first until I am sure I have their attention . Then I say , " Wait . . . just wait . . . until you 're a mother . " ( Occasionally , my son , who is very bright for 11 , will remind me he 's a boy and only the female species bear their young , but he gets the message . I know he does. ) // Casting curses is n't the easiest thing in the world . To work up to a pitch you need incentive , like the other day when I found a pile of dirty socks stuffed in the Erector set box . // I yelled at the top of my voice , " I hope you have identical twins . . . two weeks apart ! May your patio face southwest . May your father belch loudly at the father-son banquet . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they get home from school , I 'll think of some more . // Costume for the School Play  --  May 29 , 1968 // There is nothing that does more for my mornings than to have a child announce hysterically , " Mom ! I 'm in a play today . I need a costume ! " // Some mothers are lucky . They have children who get all the good parts . Their little girls are fairy princesses with magic wands and Sunday dresses . Or their little boys are assigned roles as toy soldiers who can be outfitted from the toy box . // Not my kids . They are always cast as a bad tooth , the Sixteenth Amendment or Mr. Courtesy . // With the bad tooth , we faked it . I wrapped the kid in a white sheet and stuck a raisin in his navel to depict a cavity . // The Sixteenth Amendment was a bit more complicated . It deals , of course , with the power of Congress to lay and collect taxes on incomes . We outfitted her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank check across her mouth stamped INSUFFICIENT FUNDS . // Mr. Courtesy was a real challenge . We finally put him in a Superman suit , changed the big red S to a big red C and told him to smile until his face broke . // Last week , one of the kids did it again . " Hey , Mom . I forgot to tell you , but I 'm in a play today . " // " Do n't sweat it , " I said calmly . " I 'll get a costume . What are you ? " // " I 'm a participle , " he said . // I steadied myself against the stove . " Split or dangling ? " // " You 're confused , " he said . " I only dangle . Dan Freeby is the one who splits . He 's an infinitive . " // " Wonderful , " I said . " Now , what did you have in mind ? " // " I do n't care . The teachers just want me to modify Mike Ferrett. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . Whatever nouns wear . " // " You 're right , " I said . " You see one noun , you 've seen them all . Look , why do n't you just wear a clean shirt and your slipover with your Sunday pants ? " // " That 's dumb , " he said . " Who 'd know I was a participle ? " // " Who 'd know you were n't ? " I snapped . // " If this will help you , " he said , " I look exactly like a gerund. " // I promised myself a good stiff belt of vanilla if I lived through this morning . // Outgrowing Naps  --  August 14 , 1968 // A group of young mothers huddled around the kiddie pool the other day discussing children 's naps. // " I think Lisa has outgrown naps , " said one pretty blonde . " She 's twenty-two months now and told me she did n't want to rest in the afternoons anymore . " // I nearly fell out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a child under two sets her own schedule ? // In my book the question was never to nap or not to nap but rather how old should a mother be before her naps are discontinued ? It seems like only yesterday my son confronted me with the decision . // " Do I have to nap again today ? " // " Yes . " // " Why ? " // " Because I fell asleep while having my teeth filled this morning . " // " Were you tired ? " // " I was n't bored . " // " Can I mess around while you nap ? " // " No ! " // " Why ? " // " Because you get into things . " // " Name me one . " // " Putting bubble gum on the nozzle of the garden hose , turning on the water and having it break and flood the living room . " // " Name me two . " // " Go to sleep . " // " Can I have a drink ? " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My toenail is turning black . " // " Try washing it . " // " What happens if I do n't take a nap now ? " // " You go to bed at five-thirty. " // " Why do I have to sleep when you 're tired ? " // " For the same reason I put a sweater on you when I am cold . " // " I 'm the only fifth-grader I know who comes to ball practice with chenille creases on his face . " // " That 's the thanks a mother gets for sacrificing herself two hours every afternoon to see that her child gets the proper rest . " // He sighed and said , " If you snore , should I roll you over on your side ? " // Smart-mouth kid . // A Mother 's Eye  --  August 18 , 1968 // Of all the means of communication known to man , none is quite as effective as the Mother 's Eye . Or , as we say , one glance is worth a thousand punches in the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these are a few of the old standards . // THE LOOK OF DEATH : This is used on a child with a busy finger up his nose . ( It is similar to the Frozen Stare usually employed to catch a waiter 's eye , but is somewhat different . ) It 's a steady gaze , unflinching and unyielding . The brow is furrowed , the lips are firm with no trace of a smile . The face remains in a hypnotic state until the finger is removed from the nose . // THE DEADPAN GLARE : This is the one most often used at the dinner table for children who fill their glasses to overflowing , eat gravy with their fingers and bulge their cheeks with food . On some occasions , the Deadpan Glare is accompanied by a good swift kick in the thigh under the table . // THE MARTYR 'S COUNTENANCE : This is unmistakably the look of pain and is conjured up when a child parades down the church aisle carrying his training pants or demands the $2 you borrowed from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuse the Martyr 's Countenance with the Deadpan Glare . When in doubt , remember that the Martyr 's Countenance is accompanied by tears , biting of the lower lip until it bleeds and fainting . // THE DESPERATE SQUINT is a real study in pantomime . The jaw is set firm , the lips curl and the eyes are narrow and menacing . They dart back and forth . It is used when a child is loose at the mouth and asks in a loud voice if it is true Aunt Helen would n't know what to do with a man if she found one . If Aunt Helen happens to be in the room at the time these words are uttered , a mother often goes into her Divine Guidance Stare . // THE DIVINE GUIDANCE STARE is a desperate look where her head is tilted upward , her eyes roll back until the whites show and the lips utter what seems to be a Buddhist prayer . // Perhaps the most feared of all looks is a mother 's No Look look . This appears to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa with his muddy feet or running around at an adult party at 2 A.M. , but beware . The most literal translation of the No Look look comes from a youngster who interpreted it as " When the company goes , head for the bed and look small and helpless until it blows over . " // Confirmed Shouter  --  March 5 , 1969 // Ever since President Nixon 's inaugural plea to " speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices , " I 've had misgivings about my big mouth . // I 've always admired parents who discipline their children in hushed whispers : " Arthur , you are a naughty boy for turning on all the gas jets . Now I want you to drag your little sister out into the fresh air , give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and apologize . Do n't make Mama have to raise her voice . " // I 'm a shouter . Once on a vacation when one of the kids turned on the car heater while going through Georgia , my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Huron , Michigan . // No one is born a shrew . I used to watch women getting flushed and angry while they chewed out their children and I 'd say to myself , " My goodness , that woman is going to have a heart attack . No one should discipline a child in anger . " ( I was five at the time and being flogged with a yardstick by my mother. ) // Having children of my own knocked a hole in that theory . To begin with , there were only 32 hours out of every week when I was n't angry , and then I was sleeping . // Also , I discovered children never took a " no " seriously unless the dishes rattled when you said it . // And the real clincher came when I discovered I had runners . " Runners " are kids who , when they commit some sin , take off for the fields , trees , basements , neighbors , attics or sewers. // Did you ever try to whisper to someone you could n't see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor who was born out of her time . She belonged in a hoopskirt eating a basket lunch at Tara . // I lived next to her for four years , and not once did that disgusting old dame raise her voice . Of course you can imagine what that made me sound like . ( The Shore Patrol breaking up a floating crap game. ) // Anyway , one day the boys were throwing a ball against her house and she appeared like an apparition at the door , gestured to them and said softly , " Boys , would you-all come here for a moment ? " // I watched her gesturing , talking and smiling . When she finished the boys disbanded . // I pounced on my son . " What did that mealy-mouthed little frail have to say to you boys ? " // " She said if we broke her windows , she 'd break our faces ! " // From that day forward I forgave her for her quietness . What she lacked in volume she made up for in content . What class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice , but when you 've got varicose neck veins from years of shouting , it is n't going to be easy . Will you put down that coffee cup and pay attention ? I said it is n't going to be easy ! // Youngest Child Tries to Tell a Joke  --  May 23 , 1969 // Our youngest child has been trying to tell a joke at the dinner table for the last three years . The same one . // I feel sorry for the kid . To be on the tail end of a family means anything you come up with has either been told or is n't worth telling . We can always tell when his favorite magazine comes in the mail . He will rush into the kitchen and say , " Why did it take three Boy Scouts to help a little old lady across the street ? " and one of the older ones will shout , " Because she did n't want to go , you cluck ! " // Personally I wish he 'd take the magazine , crumple it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never does . He always looks amazed that someone knew the answer and says , " That 's right . " // Next month , it 's the same old deal . " How do you stop an elephant from charging ? " His sister , looking bored , will snap , " Let me guess . You take away his credit cards . " // " That 's right , " he says , perplexed . // About three years ago he said , " Have you heard the story about a man who bought a mousetrap and went to the refrigerator for cheese and  --  " // " Which reminds me , " interrupted his father . " Who ate the beer cheese ? " // " I did n't eat it , " one of the kids said . " I used it for bass bait . " // In the months to follow , we were to hear the preamble to the joke dozens of times ... always with interruptions , never completed . // Finally , one day last week I said , " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese for bait . " // " Well , " he said , perching himself on the stool , " he found out he did n't have any cheese for bait , so he cut a picture from a magazine of a piece of cheese . When he woke up the next morning , know what he found in his trap ? A picture of a mouse . " // " Tell it at dinner , " I urged . // Under protest , the family sat rigid and listened to the story without interruption . By the time he got to his punch line he was hysterical . His eyes were shining with excitement , and I thought he was going to explode as he built for his big finish . " And do you know what he found in his trap ? " he asked . " A mouse ! " // No one said a word . I wonder whether Henny Youngman got started this way . // No More Oatmeal Kisses  --  January 29 , 1969 // A young mother writes : " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period after the children are grown and gone . Right now I 'm up to my eyeballs in laundry and muddy boots . The baby is teething ; the boys are fighting . My husband just called and said to eat without him , and I fell off my diet .

Or , " You guys get outside and find yourselves something to do . . . and do n't slam the door ! " And they won't. // You 'll straighten up the boys ' bedroom neat and tidy : bumper stickers discarded , bedspread tucked and smooth , toys displayed on the shelves . Hangers in the closet . Animals caged . And you 'll say out loud , " Now I want it to stay this way . " And it will . // You 'll prepare a perfect dinner with a salad that has n't been picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the icing , and you 'll say , " Now , there 's a meal for company .

" And you 'll have it . // No more plastic tablecloths stained with spaghetti . No more bedspreads to protect the sofa from damp bottoms . No more gates to stumble over at the top of the basement steps . No more clothespins under the sofa . No more playpens to arrange a room around . // No more anxious nights under a vaporizer tent . No more sand on the sheets or Popeye movies in the bathroom . No more iron-on patches , rubber bands for ponytails , tight boots or wet knotted shoestrings. // Imagine .

No more Christmas presents out of toothpicks and library paste . No more sloppy oatmeal kisses . No more tooth fairy . No giggles in the dark . No knees to heal , no responsibility . // Only a voice crying , " Why do n't you grow up ? " and the silence echoing , " I did . "
