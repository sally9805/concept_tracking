<p> JUDGE Richard Goldstone has the quiet confidence of a man who knows he is making a difference . <p> As head of the government-appointed commission probing political violence in this country , Justice Goldstone has emerged as arguably the most indispensable arbitrator in South Africa 's turbulent transition to democracy . <p> African National Congress ( ANC ) head Nelson Mandela has sometimes questioned Goldstone 's judgment , but never his integrity . President Frederik de Klerk has moved swiftly when chided by Goldstone over slow implementation of proposals . <p> " Anyone in public life has a duty to speak out on public issues , " he said in a Monitor interview . " If there is doubt as to where a moral issue ends and a political issue begins , then judges should err on the side of speaking out . " <p> Since the commission was formed in October 1991 , Goldstone has become a household name here and was recently voted by a South African radio station as the top newsmaker of 1992 - well ahead of both Mr. Mandela and President De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his term : Between 200 and 300 people are killed every month , mainly in the simmering conflict in Natal province and the townships around Johannesburg . But diplomats and political scientists say that violence levels would be much higher without him . <p> " Perhaps even more significant than the specific achievements of the commission , " says a Western diplomat who has closely monitored it , " is the fact that an institution with such credibility and authority ... could emerge from a society as polarized as South Africa . " Rolling back apartheid <p> Goldstone left his stamp on the law books during a decade on the bench of the Transvaal Supreme Court ( 1980-90 ) with several judgments that played pivotal roles in rolling back the frontiers of legislative apartheid . The most notable of these was the 1981 ruling in the case of Gladys Govender v. the State that effectively halted the enforcement of the Group Areas Act , which segregated residential areas by race . <p> Goldstone says the credibility that his commission now enjoys has a lot to do with the credibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " At all times through the centuries , " Goldstone says , " South Africa has had a truly independent judiciary . Throughout the years of apartheid , black people used the courts to establish civil rights . <p> Non-governmental organizations like the Legal Resources Centre were able to push back the frontiers of apartheid by using the courts . " <p> Unlike some of his colleagues , Goldstone says he faced no moral dilemma over whether or not to accept an appointment as a judge during the apartheid era . He says judges have a duty to speak out . <p> By taking on the job of investigating political violence , Goldstone has had to negotiate his way through a quagmire of mistrust . He insists that it has not been as daunting as people make out . <p> But it has not always been smooth sailing . <p> He has been accused by the ANC of allowing his reports to be distorted by the government ; he has been accused by government spokesmen of making " wild statements " ; he has been cold-shouldered by the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom Party . The left-of-center newspaper Weekly Mail accused him of " matching criticism with praise and doling out each , in equal quantities , to everyone . " <p> Some Western diplomats are concerned that the judge did not insist on a more hands-on approach to the investigation triggered by his dramatic raid last November on a company that served as a front for South African military intelligence . <p> There , the judge found evidence of involvement of the former head of military intelligence in recent " dirty tricks " to discredit the ANC . <p> Goldstone 's public disclosure of the raid and his findings rocked the security establishment and forced De Klerk to act . <p> The president 's decision to order Defense Force Chief-of-Staff Gen. Pierre Steyn to probe all intelligence activities - in cooperation with Goldstone - has presented a public challenge to the judge 's authority . <p> After a much-publicized meeting with De Klerk , five days after Goldstone 's disclosures of the raid , the judge opted to remain silent . He assured Western diplomats that he had both the resources and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the past , he has acted swiftly to defuse threatening situations and he has consistently censured political leaders who make inflammatory political speeches . People 's conduct changes <p> Goldstone has proposed practical measures to end violence on commuter trains , in taxis , in the mines , in men-only township hostels , and in the war-ravaged hills of Natal Province . <p> " The commission has been a vitally important safety valve , " Goldstone told the Monitor in an interview in his Cape Town office overlooking Table Mountain . <p> The most important aspect of the commission , he says , is that it provides a " credible public instrument " to deal with disasters such as last summer 's massacres at Boipatong and Bisho , Ciskei , and thus prevent a total breakdown in the negotiations between the ANC and the government over majority rule . <p> In addition to 18 reports on specific instances of violence , diplomats credit Goldstone 's most important achievements as : <p> * His catalytic role in reversing the government 's stand on an international role in the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then taking on - subversive elements in the military . <p> * Providing a vehicle for restructuring the security forces . <p> The judge says that the involvement of the international community , which followed the breakdown in negotiations after the mas- sacre of 42 people at Boipatong , has been of paramount importance in reducing the levels of violence and changing patterns of behavior . <p> " People 's conduct has changed as a result of the presence of international observers , " he says . <p> In April last year - and in the face of strenuous government resistance - Goldstone insisted on the presence of five key inter- national experts on a panel to advise on rules for public protest . <p> Goldstone regards the guidelines laid down in the report , issued last month , as the commission 's greatest success . The principles have been adhered to by both the police and the ANC . <p> The panel was led by Prof. Philip Heymann , director of the Center for Criminal Justice at Harvard Law School , and it included New York Police Commissioner Lee Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head the investigation into the police response to the Boipatong massacre . <p> Some lawyers say Goldstone 's character is the key to his success . <p> " I do n't think anyone else could have done it , " says a human rights lawyer who has worked with the judge . <p> " He has the rare ability to straddle both the legal and political worlds , " he observes . " He is a great strategist and combines a deep humanity with a political sensitivity . " <p> Democratic Party leader Zach de Beer sees Goldstone as an ideal candidate for taking charge of the security forces during the transition in South Africa . <p> His appointment on the political violence commission is for three years and he hopes it will not be longer . <p> " The shorter the life of this commission , the better for South Africa , " he says
