" More matter , with less art , " Queen Gertrude advises Polonius ; she sounds like a modern magazine editor . The appetite in the print trade is presently for real stuff  --  the dirt , the poop , the nitty-gritty  --  and not for the obliquities and tenuosities of fiction . A writer is almost never asked to write a story , let alone a poem ; instead he or she is invited to pen introductions , reviews , and personal essays , preferably indiscreet . ( Pen them , then fax them . Instant modemed communication and rapidly overlapping semes are ? la mode . ) Human curiosity , the abettor and stimulant of the fiction surge between Robinson Crusoe 's adventures and Constance Chatterley 's , has become ever more literal-minded and impatient with the proxies of the imagination . Present taste runs to the down-home divulgences of the talk show  --  psychotherapeutic confession turned into public circus  --  and to investigative journalism that , like so many heat-seeking missiles , seeks out the intimate truths , the very genitalia , of Presidents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a millennium , time is too precious to waste on anything but such central , perennially urgent data . And so it has come to pass that , in the 1990s , as I turned sixty and then reached sixty-two ( senior discount at the movies ! ) and then passed retirement age , instead of devoting myself wholly to the elaboration of a few final theorems and dreams couched in the gauzy genres of make-believe , I have cranked out , in response to many a plausible request , the mass of more or less factual matter , of assorted prose , which Knopf has herewith heroically , indulgently printed and bound , my fifth such collection and  --  dare we hope ?  --  my last . // In this terminal decade the editor of my favorite magazine , The New Yorker , became Tina Brown . It has been my bewildering professional experience to see the editors of that revered journal go from being much older , wiser heads , gray and authoritative , with a shamanistic mystique , to being all  --  with the friendly exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough in most cases to be my sons and daughters , with an adult child 's willful and mysterious fondness for loud music , late nights , unheard-of celebrities , and electronic innovation . However , Ms. Brown 's demeanor toward me , during her tenure , was engagingly benign , and I tried , albeit somewhat arthritically , to dance to her tune  --  contributing , for instance , to the back-page " Shouts and Murmurs " which she revived from the days of Alexander Woollcott , and answering her call to write about Lana Turner and Gene Kelly , whose videos I was nostalgically happy to view . The magazine 's books department passed , through a flurry of interim managers , from the relaxed custody of the late , gravel-voiced Edith Oliver to the more scholastic , tremulously sensitive care of Henry Finder . The kind of books , mostly fiction from Europe and other exotic realms , that I used to be assigned for review yielded to meatier fare , like biographies of such imposing figures as Isaac Newton , Abraham Lincoln , Queen Elizabeth II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure for even greener pastures ) Helen Keller . These august subjects subtended areas of knowledge shadowy to me , but the late William Shawn  --  whose blessed memory has itself recently undergone some biographical elaboration  --  made it a principle not to assign books to specialists in the field , so I was already habituated , as a reviewer , to being at sea and steering by starlight . Also , on their own intellectual initiative , the new editors composed , in the hope that I might become a Critic at Large , a few bouquets of related titles for me to admire and address ; in this volume 's section " Medleys , " the first two conjunctions were my idea , and the next two theirs . Presciently , they had me tackle the Titanic a year before the movie swept all before it . Another ambitious assignment , on Edith Wharton and her cinematic spinoffs , took me uneasily into territory already thoroughly patrolled by Anthony Lane . He and I bumped heads in the dark of a midtown screening room and I beat a quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulously , tirelessly edited , requests to write to a certain specified length and on a certain timely topic much less obtruded upon a writer 's consciousness in the days when William Shawn sustained the editorial illusion of a full and ghostly freedom . Reviews were allowed to run until the reviewer felt depleted ; now one aims at a shorter length of nine hundred words or a much longer of around three thousand . Snappy or expansive , take your pick . My reviewing habit , hard to break , was to quote extensively ; just as the impossibly ideal map would be the same size as the territory mapped , the ideal review would quote the book in its entirety , without comment . In a strange way , the passing of the Cold War has made it harder to frame a literary opinion ; the polarities of right versus left and red versus free lent a tension to aesthetic questions miles removed from the Manichaean global struggle . Fiction from the Communist world was inevitably considered from a political angle , but that of Europe and the Americas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate , carried on country by country , between Marx and Adam Smith on how one should live . Economic realities , in the form of declining ad revenues , had at last overtaken The New Yorker , which for so long seemed exempt from the crasser considerations . Her model for renovation , Tina Brown let it be known , was the magazine edited by Harold Ross  --  a peppier , saucier , and succincter publication that proclaimed itself not for the old lady from Dubuque . The old lady from Dubuque had become , over the years , one of the faithful subscribers , and then she got doddery . That a doddery contributor like myself might still have a part to play in the redesigned , more sharply angled pages was a comforting thought . I fell in love with the magazine as a child , from what seemed an immense distance . Appearing under the same Rea Irvin-designed title-type and department logos as White and Thurber and Cheever and those magical cartoons was for me a dream come true . It still is. // Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a magazine writer , a wordsmith as the profession was understood in the industrial first half of the century , and I like seeing my name in what they used to call " hard type . " The magazine rack at the corner drugstore beguiled me with its tough gloss . The academization and etherealization and latterly the devaluing deconstruction of the writer 's trade in the second half of the century have taken me by surprise , though my Harvard education should have prepared me . Journalism has not only its social stimulations but its aesthetic virtues . An invitation into print , from however suspect a source , is an opportunity to make something beautiful , to discover within oneself a treasure that would otherwise have remained buried . When the call comes from beyond one 's own language  --  from a German , French , Brazilian , or Japanese publication  --  the opportunity is to go back to basics , to write of one 's own cultural context more bluntly than would be seemly at home , and to phrase an English that , in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two contributions to the Lufthansa Bordbuch ( an elegant publication recently trimmed down ) appeared in English and German both ; otherwise , I explained the cold to Brazilians , my short stories to the Japanese , and my poems to the French with an agreeable sensation of hiding behind a foreign language , as when in my escapades as a cultural ambassador I spoke through a bilingual intermediary . Introducing works by other authors , especially those secure in the lists of immortality , offers the pleasure of another , pedagogic impersonation ; the introductions to certain works of Melville , Wharton , and Henry Green gave me the quiet joys of a scholar as he adds his careful modicum to an extensive bibliography . The lecture on New York writing exploited the anthologies of others and marks another occasion when the rustle of mock-professorial robes cosseted my ears . " Religion and Literature " was actually a chapter in a textbook , The Religion Factor , published by a Presbyterian press ; I took it upon myself , perhaps wickedly , to remind the presumed students of divinity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died , as it were , in literature 's embrace . The itch to inform is perhaps as pernicious a goad to utterance as the itch to charm . // The invitations to inform or charm that come my way are limited by the meagre number of my areas of supposed expertise . Of golf I have had my say in Golf Dreams , though a foreword late to tee off offered itself for inclusion in More Matter . Suburban interrelations creep into discussions of dancing , suntanning , and the Fifties . Among living American authors , I take , it may be , an anomalously positive or at least hopeful view of our Republic 's progress ; hence I am occasionally trusted by the powers that be to expound on matters of state , as the reader can see in the first section . On the strength of my early cartooning ambitions , my single year at an English art school , and my willingness to feel happy in museums , Art and Antiques , The New Republic , and The New York Review of Books have over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , Just Looking , has already been made of such articles ; this present volume holds , in addition to commentary on movies and photographs , those art reviews which did not , it seemed to me , require color illustration , or illustration at all . // As in my other eight-years ' gatherings , Picked-Up Pieces , Hugging the Shore , and Odd Jobs , the last section rounds up snippets , some a mere paragraph , pertaining to me and my works . My excuses for this methodical narcissism are that all authorial activity is egoistic anyway and that close students of my work  --  there are a few  --  will be interested . In truth , so impenetrably loom the paper mountains of a diligent oeuvre , that interviewers rarely seem aware of my faithful deposits of opinion and autobiography . Again and again I am asked questions already patiently answered in print . Never mind ; predator satiation being one of nature 's survival techniques , I answer them again , and thus add a bit more superfluous self-description to what we might laughingly call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of the satiation . The inventory of my rather paltry childhood reading keeps coming round , and I fear the same Henry James quotation is invoked three times ; in each case it seemed indispensable , and too choice to paraphrase. // A child begins to play at art in the faith that there is a treasure house where the most accomplished work is stored , to last forever , forever consulted . Intimations of the definitive tinged my creative excitement at its outset , around and under our family dining-room table , with its Tiffany lampshade of many glowing colors . There is a bliss in making sets of things , and in bringing something imperfect closer to perfection  --  firmly inking in a sketchy drawing , adding a few more verbal enhancements to a final proof . Or , in a review , listing , say , the exotic words in Norman Rush 's Mating and the savored meals in Ardashir Vakil 's Beach Boy . The assembly and arrangement of a book like More Matter offers such satisfactions  --  the tactile thrill of the fixed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " struggles against the realizations , come upon me late in life , that paper decays , that readership dwindles , that a book is a kind of newspaper , that the most polished composition loses edge to the flow of language and cultural context , that no masterpiece will outlast the human race , that the race is but an incident in the fauna of our planet , that our planet is doomed to die in a hiccup of the sun , that the sun will eventually implode and explode , and that the universe itself is a transitory scribble on the surface , so oddly breached fifteen billion years ago , of nothingness . Wow ! Zap ! Nevertheless , the living must live , a writer must write . Enough said . So bulky a book warrants a brief preface .
