Sooner or later , we always seem to wind up back in the candy factory . You remember the scene : Lucy and Ethel go to work on a candy-wrapping assembly line . A conveyor belt feeds them chocolates at a ridiculously fast clip . They try desperately to keep up , frantically stuffing the candy into their blouses , hats and mouths before the supervisor returns . A comedy classic . <P> And now a comedy cliche . Nearly 40 years after the scene was first aired  --  on Sept. 15 , 1952 , as the opening episode of I Love Lucy 's second season  --  it may be the most frequently repeated bit of film in television history . One recent sighting came in October , on the NBC special Funny Women of Television . It got a vigorous workout during all those TV tributes to Lucille Ball following her death in April 1989 . It is one of two episodes reprised in full on a laser disc released by the Criterion Collection to commemorate the show 's 40th anniversary . And , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some local station somewhere , part of the endlessly renewable cycle of I Love Lucy reruns . <P> Has a popular art form ever been so infatuated with its past ? Increasingly , it seems that we are not viewing television so much as perpetually re-viewing it . A network show that becomes a hit is only starting its TV life cycle . The next step is a big syndication deal , then years and years of reruns on local stations and cable . Virtually every TV anniversary , star 's death or Emmy Awards show provides an excuse to trot out another edition of Scenes We Like to See Over and Over Again : Ralph Kramden bickering with Alice , Elvis gyrating on Ed Sullivan , Lou Grant meeting Mary Richards for the first time ( " I hate spunk ! " ) . <P> Even network prime time is falling under the spell of the past . Last February , CBS drew stellar ratings for a two-hour special celebrating The Ed Sullivan Show , and did nearly as well with tributes to All in the Family and The Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic- TV binge , with homages to M*A*S*H and The Bob Newhart Show , along with a second compilation of Sullivan clips . In June , to much fanfare , the network introduced a new sitcom from Norman Lear . The show , Sunday Dinner , was soundly beaten in the ratings by the program that followed it  --  20-year-old reruns of Lear 's All in the Family . <P> TV 's recycling process has been pushed to peak capacity by a profusion of cable channels searching for low-cost programming to fill their schedules . Nick at Nite woos baby boomers each evening with campy sitcoms like The Donna Reed Show and Get Smart . The Family Channel has cornered the market in old westerns ( Wagon Train , The Virginian ) , while the Arts &; Entertainment Network , originally conceived as a haven for fine-arts programming , now runs oldies , like The Avengers and Mrs. Columbo . Ted Turner 's cable operation may attract a lot of attention with MGM movie blockbusters and environmental specials , but its most dependable ratings grabber is that unglamorous , uncolorized war- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
