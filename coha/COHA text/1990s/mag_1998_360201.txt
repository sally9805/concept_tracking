If there is such a thing as a secret American Dream , it has many more rooms than inhabitants and gold-plated fixtures to boot . We all crave stately pleasure domes , such Xanadus as William Randolph Hearst 's San Simeon and Bill Gates ' new ode to monstrosity in Seattle . But only the occasional hyper-mogul ever attains one . These opulent shrines to capitalism we regard with a mixture of envy , awe and abhorrence : " Is n't that ridiculous  --  nobody needs a house that big . " Or , " Just think how hard it would be to keep that thing clean . " The fact that he or she has a Xanadu  --  and you do n't  --  proves that the owner is a greedy hustler or a planet-polluting slumlord with close Mob ties who should be flogged into bankruptcy like Donald Trump ( and , unlike him , left there ) . <P> This Puritan disdain for ostentation is a cherished tradition . After all , Thomas Paine penned Common Sense hoping to liberate Americans from the grip of ostentatious English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. history teaches that today 's Horatio Alger ( see Andrew Carnegie ) is tomorrow 's robber baron ( see Andrew Carnegie )  --  unless , of course , the baron performs a useful public service , such as owning a pro sports team or three , like 60-year-old Ted Turner , who also recently gave a billion dollars to the United Nations for humanitarian causes . Turner was following the tradition of the Astors , Mellons and yes , Carnegie , who put much of their fortune into such good works as libraries , hospitals and museums . Microsoft 's Gates , by contrast , has yet to follow robber-baron etiquette  --  other than pouring money into his own dream castle . <P> In the early 1990s everybody was pulling for Gates , who proved that even an uber-nerd whom the rest of us beat up in the playground could make it big in the land of opportunity . But the world 's richest man made the classic hubristic mistake : building what one newspaper called the " new Xanadu " and bragging about it . Gates ' high-tech haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most grandiose castle in America . But as Hearst once quipped of his estate  --  which housed , among other things , a large zoo  --  " Pleasure is what you can afford to pay for it . " And Gates is richer than Hearst ever dreamed of being , as his " tastes " reveal : an indoor pool ; a 1 1/2-story trampoline room ; a salmon stream ; a movie theater ; a miniature-golf course . Perhaps the most telling gilded lily in Gates ' mansion is a system of electronic " art panels " in every room , which at a mouse click allows the lord of the manor to display whatever , say , Rembrandt painting or Ansel Adams photograph he fancies . The rooms even interact with visitors , each of whom gets a microchip ID on arrival .
