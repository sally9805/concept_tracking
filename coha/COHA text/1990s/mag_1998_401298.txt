Intent on stalking a legendary elk nicknamed " Solomon , " this blackpowder hunter did n't realize another bull was on guard duty Photograph Photograph // Sometime earlier that afternoon I had given up . My aching muscles and discouraged spirit signaled the end to the hunt . Oh , I 'd keep my eyes open on my way back to camp , but that would be about it . As I approached the ridgetop , I found myself at the exact location from which I had first bugled that morning . An omen ? No , I do n't believe in them . However , my legs needed a break , so why not bugle while I rested ? I slid the grunt tube around to the front of my body and positioned my favorite diaphragm call in my mouth . The clear , clean , four-pitched melody echoed back down into the valley . This particular area was known as " The Gorge , " appropriately named for its steep narrow canyons and deep-cut ravines . The mature lodgepole pine forest contained " dog-hair " thickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winds continuously filtered downhill from all sides carrying any scent to the valley 's inhabitants . The very conditions which made this area difficult to hunt were the primary reasons why the elk were there in the first place . It was some of the finest elk habitat I had ever encountered , a veritable " bull hole . " Although I thoroughly enjoy all aspects of being an elk guide , I was particularly enjoying this hunt without a client . Seldom can I get out by myself and hunt the way my father taught me-tracking along at my pace , as fast as possible ; knowing just when to slow down or stop ; constantly studying the forest around me for ears , legs , horns , anything that might materialize into an elk ; trying bugling and calling strategies , a game of balancing aggression with caution , silence against the bellows of challenge ; sneaking into a bedding or feeding area . There is something about doing this all by myself that fulfills and satisfies a very special need . After 15 minutes of complete silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared to offer another challenge . Fog had moved in , transforming The Gorge into a sea of haunting emptiness . My piercing call seemed absorbed by the heavy moisture , trapping even the echo I 'd been accustomed to hearing . I resumed my position , then stretched out flat to relieve the various back and shoulder pains that had accumulated during the long hunt . Snowflakes settled on my face . Snowstorms in Colorado 's Rawah Wilderness can be expected almost year-round , but it had been a bit unusual in that it had snowed 7 of the 14 days this muzzleloader season . I could n't complain , though ; the storms seemed to encourage the elk to use their full vocal repertoire . Another 15 minutes passed , and with it a third unsuccessful attempt to bring forth a response . My fingers kept busy tracing the design of new scars in the stock of my .54-caliber Hawken . A fall had flawed the finish I had worked so long to achieve . I should have known better than to jump onto that wet rock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and my carelessness only served to remind me just how quickly and easily things can turn unexpected out here in the woods . I tried to think of other places to hunt , but just could n't get excited about moving anywhere else . The Gorge was the only place I 'd found Solomon that year , and I had spent the entire muzzleloader season hunting specifically for him . The other guides and I had given this bull the nickname after years of being humbled by his wisdom . Living with elk daily , three months a year , develops an intimate relationship between hunter and quarry . One of the results of such extended time in each other 's presence is the privilege of coming to know the individual animals-their habits , patterns , sizes and even their offspring ( if you 'll allow for a little speculation ) . Yet , equipped with all these advantages , I was still unable to get close enough to Solomon for a shot . Solomon usually separated himself from any herd in the area . This may be typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon held to this routine during the rut , throughout the winter and ( as far as we guides could figure ) even through the summer months . Periodically , he could be found keeping company with one other bull . Before you start thinking too hard about sexual orientation , let me suggest a reasonable possibility for such a bull pairing , which is unusual but not unique : As a team , two bulls can watch each other 's back when feeding , bedding or moving from area to area , while minimizing their chances of being seen or heard . During the six years that we had identified these two together , they would invariably bed approximately 100 yards apart , positioned to watch opposite directions . We also found signs of where one seemed to " stand guard " while the other would nuzzle in the snow for little stems of " kinik-kinik " ( a local delicacy of elk ) , which I 've discovered to be a little bitter and not very filling . Solomon 's partner was named " Broken Toe . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crooked toe on his right hind hoof . Although Solomon was larger , I assumed Broken Toe to be the elder , because he always led the escape whenever we had a close encounter . Speculation led a number of guides , including me , to believe that Broken Toe might also be Solomon 's father , or perhaps just another bull who had raised him after his mother was killed . If this were true , Solomon would learn all of this elder 's secret hideouts and survival tricks , resulting in a formidable pair for any hunter to take on . A clap of thunder rolled past me and I instinctively bugled at the sound . I had heard elk do this and thought it might add credibility to my solitary calls . A barely audible response rose from the depths of The Gorge . It was difficult to refrain from answering immediately , but generally it is best to start off slow . A few minutes later I inquired again , this time stimulating a quick , unmistakable rebuttal . With each successive exchange , the replying chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous melody of bugles , grunts , cow/calf calls , whistles and chuckles . This unusual display was the result of two separate herds mingling , greatly confusing the already bewildered " raghorns " that were so numerous that year . Trying to identify all the participants was impossible . I listened intently for Solomon , but to little avail . Satisfied that his distinctive voice was not among the chorus , I was perfectly content just to listen for the last hour of the season . I remember thinking how great a hunt this had been , and how appropriate this rousing ending . As I relived the events of the past two weeks in my mind , an unmistakable scream brought me to my feet . After replaying my recordings of Solomon so many times , I thought I 'd be able to pick him out anywhere , but now there were so many bugles that maybe I 'd twisted the sounds into what I so desperately wanted to hear . I removed my hat to better distinguish the various calls , but with each passing moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been Solomon 's voice echoing in my mind . Then , with his second bugle , there could be no mistake . I found myself running and sliding down the steep hillside . Did I remember my gun ? Yes , it was in my hand . My grunt tube ? Still around my neck . Somehow I 'd managed to keep everything I needed with me . Except perhaps common sense . The thickest area of downfall was directly below . Knowing I would n't have enough time to work around it , I bulled straight ahead on course for the source of that distinctive bugle . Any attempt to be quiet would be futile . As I emerged from the dark timber , the bugling ceased . I estimated the elk 's location and now proceeded cautiously . If even one cow spotted me , hope of finding Solomon would be lost for another year . My pace slowed as my senses focused on the aspens around me . There were freshly rubbed saplings , and the sickening-sweet aroma of elk filled the air . Dropping to one knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As ghostly shadows of elk appeared through the trees , I managed to conceal myself behind a nearby rock . It was getting dark and time was running out . I chanced another bugle , knowing full well that it might simply scare everything away . Deafening screams vindicated my decision to bugle again and all resumed as before , save that the chorus was even more intense . Being in the middle of it this time , I could actually feel the calls-their sound penetrating my clothing and flesh . An uncontrollable trembling began deep inside me , a feeling I had not experienced for many years . Several bulls were now within range , disappearing then reappearing in the fog . I could n't possibly compromise my quest now with a lesser animal , not with Solomon somewhere in range . I continued to answer each of Solomon 's challenges with an exact imitation , hoping to irritate him enough to make a mistake . I was trying to keep track of all the elk , but too many things were taking place . One bull chased another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep to himself . The horns of two others clacked in the distance-it did n't sound too serious , probably just a couple of young bulls sparring . Most of the elk were just standing around listening , much the same as me . Suddenly , there he was . Solomon 's heavy horns swayed back and forth as he approached . I squeezed the trigger and slowly cocked back the hammer , avoiding the usual " click " of a muzzleloader . My left leg was doubled under , so I moved it slightly , preparing to rise and shoot . A crash behind me commanded my attention . Broken Toe had flanked me and was charging . His thick , massive rack was distorted and broken , probably a combination of excessive age and his determined fighting nature . He was already within 15 feet , leaving me no time to bring my gun around . I pushed backward and fell to the ground , just managing to avoid those long tines by inches . The enraged bull spooked as he thundered past . He was bolting away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my shoulder . Regaining my senses , I turned and checked for Solomon . He was walking away , but probably still within range . However , the trees were too thick for a shot . I surveyed in front of Solomon , searching for openings . As his light-colored body entered the narrow gap I 'd selected , tree limbs I had n't noticed came into focus . And now his body was angling away , leaving few vital areas exposed . " Do n't always count on a wide-open broadside shot ... sometimes you have to take what 's available . " Over the years I must have said that to a hundred clients . Well , sometimes you also have to pass on a bad shot . I pulled up and placed my thumb under the hammer . The only thing more disheartening than letting him go was the thought of a wounded Solomon running off to die , only to be eaten by coyotes , his beautiful antlers gnawed away by porcupines , squirrels and mice . This is probably what will eventually happen to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards will allow . In stately , unhurried grandeur , Solomon moved off . I can only think to meet up with , and to thank , his bodyguard . Epilogue A few years after my encounter with Solomon and Broken Toe , we did finally catch up with the latter . Judging from his teeth , Broken Toe was approximately 15 years old at the time . One of my archery hunters claimed him as a trophy after yet another two-hour bugle session . What I had mistaken to be a deformed and broken rack turned out to be one of the most unique heads I 've ever seen . The right side was a normal , heavy , typical 5-points , but his left side sported a total of three separate bases and antlers . Broken Toe 's front two were full-length beams with four and three points , respectively ; however , the third antler was nothing more than a hook that curled back into the hair near the ear . Solomon was never seen or heard again . Since it 's very unlikely such a bull could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he continued to outsmart everyone for the remainder of his natural life . In either case , Solomon and Broken Toe live on as big as ever ( maybe even a little bigger ) as we recount our experiences with them around the campfire each hunting season .
