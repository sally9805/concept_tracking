If you want to do business in booming Brazil , it helps to know Jorge Paulo Lemann . <p> FIVE YEARS AGO Philip Morris was in a tight corner in Brazil . It owned 40% of Brazil 's biggest chocolate maker , Industrias de Chocolate Lacta , and wanted to acquire the rest . But the Brazilian family that ran the company and owned a chunk of the stock had issued more shares , diluting Philip Morris ' stake . <p> So Philip Morris turned to a S&lt;o Paulo-based investment bank called Banco de Investimentos Garantia . Lawyers handpicked by Garantia stormed into court with evidence that the share issuance was illegal . The court agreed , and last June Philip Morris acquired the rest of Chocolate Lacta . " We tried friendly dialogue and it never worked . It was only when Garantia turned aggressive that we really turned the tables , " says Hans Grether , chief financial officer of Philip Morris ' Brazilian unit . <p> Garantia has become one of Brazil 's most profitable investment banks and most prestigious places to work-a Brazilian version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million last year on capital of $412 million , but denies what some competitors insist is true : that Garantia 's real profits exceeded $1 billion over the course of 1994 and 1995 and that it tucked away the unreported profits at Garantia Banking Ltd. , its offshore trading vehicle in the Bahamas . <p> In the last two years Garantia has handled six merger-and-acquisition deals for U.S. clients , worth a total of $2 billion . The toughest of these was the Philip Morris/Chocolate Lacta deal , but the biggest was Colgate-Palmolive 's $1 billion acquisition of Kolynos Oral Care , a leading Brazilian toothpaste maker , in January 1995 . <p> Garantia is the creation of a wiry former tennis champion named Jorge Paulo Lemann . Lemann 's father emigrated from Switzerland to Brazilin the early 1920s and started a dairy business outside of Rio de Janeiro . He sent Jorge Paulo north to Harvard , where he played tennis and finished his economics degree in three years , graduating with the class of 1961 . After working as a trainee for Credit Suisse in Switzerland , he quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , winning the Swiss nationals and playing at Wimbledon . <p> Returning to Brazil in 1963 Lemann worked at various financial houses until 1971 , when he and three partners launched Garantia as a brokerage amid the so-called Brazilian miracle . The stock market was booming and the partners paid $800,000-then the highest price ever-for the equivalent of a seat on the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange . Six weeks later the stock market fell 60% , wiping out most of Garantia 's capital . <p> Setbacks like this toughen some people , and it toughened Lemann . The young firm survived the crash by developing an expertise in trading newly created Brazilian Treasury bills . This required quick wits and skill rather than family connections . Breaking with local tradition , Lemann later ruled that Garantia 's partners could not bring their relatives to work at the bank . Unimpressed by the efforts his cofounders were making , by 1976 Lemann had bought them all out . <p> Lemann watched carefully the innovations taking place on Wall Street and lost little time bringing them to Brazil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " is that you can go outside and look at how people are doing things and copy the things you think are good . " <p> In the mid-1970s , for example , Lemann started trading and syndicating loans-soon after Wall Street started doing it and long before other Brazilian firms had caught on . <p> In 1983 Lemann and his new partners bought control of discount retail chain Lojas Americanas . Since then , Lojas Americanas ' sales have grown from $280 million to $1.9 billion , making it one of Brazil 's largest non-food retailers . In 1994 Lojas partnered with Wal-Mart and a year later opened five stores around S&lt;o Paulo . Five Garantia partners own 40% of Lojas , worth around $280 million . <p> In 1989 Garantia partners bought control of Cervejaria Brahma , Brazil 's largest brewery . A former head trader at Garantia took the helm at the brewery , raising profits from around $15 million a year to $260 million in 1995 . Various Garantia partners and entities own 20% of Brahma . <p> Lemann went to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then implemented at home what he had learned abroad . <p> Lately , however , some of Lemann 's New York friends have begun to invade the Brazilian market . Earlier this year Goldman , Sachs and Morgan Stanley opened offices in S&lt;o Paulo-the first for both in South America . No mystery what brought them . Brazilian new equity issuance , fueled in large part by privatizations , jumped to $7.9 billion last year from $3.1 billion in 1993 . For next year alone $10 billion in privatizations are slated . <p> Lemann , now 57 , admits the added competition will make it tougher to make money as spreads narrow and commissions shrink , but he 's confident he can hold his own . " It 's like a tennis match , " he says . " Sure , you 're out to kill the other guy , but if you live by the rules , it will be good for both of you . " <p> With kidnapping rampant and populism still powerful in Brazilian politics , it pays to keep a low profile if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S&lt;o Paulo in an inconspicuous Volkswagen even though Veja , a Brazilian weekly , estimates Lemann 's personal fortune at over $800 million . " We do n't want to call attention to ourselves . In Brazil people still think if you have money you did something wrong to get it , " explains Garantia 's chief executive , Claudio Haddad . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Garantia Chief Executive Claudio Haddad ( seated left ) and founder Jorge Paulo Lemann ( seated right ) , surrounded by some colleagues . Suddenly some of Lemann 's New York friends  --  Goldman , Sachs and Morgan Stanley  --  are invadiing his turf . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The state-of-the-art trading floor at Garantia 's Sao Paulo headquarters .
