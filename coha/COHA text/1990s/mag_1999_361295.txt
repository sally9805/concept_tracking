What 's up in the mail room ? The mail , for one thing : our letter writers are setting a torrid pace so far this year . The first-quarter total was an eye-glazing 18,806 letters , e-mails and faxes ( and yes , we read every blessed one of them , and some of them twice ) . For you real numbers junkies , that 's 8% more than what we bagged this time last year . <P>  --  SCANDALS HAVE THEIR GOOD POINTS : At least from a letters-count perspective . The more President Clinton got into hot water and the more Kenneth Starr investigated , the more readers wanted to sound off . Monicagate was a major factor in the volume of mail we got this year and last . Here 's a comparison of each year 's Top Four letter-getting cover stories through March . <P> FIRST QUARTER ' 99 <P> MEN OF THE YEAR , CLINTON &; STARR Dec. 28/Jan. 4 , 1,510 REVIEW OF CLINTON SCANDAL Feb. 22 , 927 MONICA LEWINSKY March 15 , 827 MILLENIUM MADNESS Jan. 18 , 731 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 2,327 TIME AT 75 March 9 , 851 KENNETH STARR Feb. 9 , 770 PAULA JONES March 23 , 620 <P>  --  ODD REQUEST : " Who were the last 50 of TIME 's Men of the Year ? More specifically , who among them was bald ? " Perhaps this reader 's question means we should be prepared for a very specialized achievers list : the Top Chrome Domes of the Century . Although we would not be very comfortable flatly asserting that the following Men of the Year were bald , it would be safe to say they were balding or , better yet , follicularly challenged : Gandhi , Churchill , Eisenhower , Truman , Mossadegh , Khrushchev , Pope John XXIII , Sadat , Gorbachev , De Klerk and Pope John Paul II . <P> Best Opening Lines of Recent Letters <P> " I have retired and now have e-mail , and so I am let loose upon the world .
