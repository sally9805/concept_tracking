When the boss talks you 're supposed to listen , or at least pretend to , right ? Well , the boss has plenty to say about the stock market these days  --  mostly that it 's too high  --  so pay attention . After all , the top dog must have known something to earn that office with a view . <P> What do corporate chiefs know about the market ? Individually , very little . Star honchos like Jack Welch at General Electric and Bill Gates at Microsoft ca n't time the Dow any better than the Beardstown Ladies . But they clearly know more about their own companies than anyone on Wall Street . So their actions as a group say something about the market as a whole . That 's why analysts monitor things like insider stock transactions , new stock offerings and corporate stock buybacks . Even for wealthy CEOs , the object is to buy low and sell high , whether in managing the company 's coffers or their own . <P> Lately , corporate managers have been selling at a fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable . For months , insiders ( corporate officers required by law to report when they buy or sell their company 's shares ) have been selling more than three shares for every one that they buy  --  the highest level in a decade , says Bob Gabele , who tracks such activity for CDA/InvestNet . " The selling has been broad and active for several quarters , " Gabele says . " It really does look like a trend . " Even at such blue-chip companies as GE and Procter &; Gamble , where insiders rarely sell , they 've been dumping stock . There are many reasons for an executive to sell : new house , college tuition , balancing his or her portfolio . Still , most have some flexibility , and hard-core selling is never a good sign . <P> Meanwhile , the pace of corporate stock buybacks is slowing . In the first quarter , companies announced plans to repurchase $39 billion of their own stock , down from $52 billion during the same period last year . At the same time , companies are flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter , vs. $28 billion last year , according to Charles Biderman , president of Liquidity Trim Tabs , an investment newsletter . Buying less , selling more . <P> Another big ( though counterintuitive ) signal that executives believe stock prices have gone too high is the recent wave of bank megamergers . Little or no cash will change hands , only some high-priced stocks . Had any of the parties involved been required to lay out real money , they would have walked . Biderman also notes that the value of stock swaps relative to cash mergers is off the charts this year . " They do n't want to buy shares with cash , " he says of acquisitive CEOs . " They 'd rather sell their own stock to make the deal . " In similar fashion , companies now include hefty sums of stock options in the pay of an array of employees . Sure , it 's what the people want . But technically , the company is selling . Biderman estimates there are $1 trillion worth of unexercised stock options out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execs cash out . <P> Could stock prices chug higher despite these signs ? Sure . It would n't be the first time the boss was wrong . But caution in the corner office should at least serve as an antidote to the infectious exuberance at the barbershop . <P> Daniel Kadlec is TIME 's Wall Street columnist .
