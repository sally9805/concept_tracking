Avoid the Traps That Can Cause a Marriage To Fail <p> As Shelli Ivie felt compelled to write about her marriage , " Marriage to Quad Ends in Divorce , " ( Su. ' 92 , p.36 ) so I find myself compelled to attempt to answer the two questions posed by the article : 1 ) Could this marriage be saved ? and 2 ) What would you have done in this situation ? <p> Shelli 's problem is much more prevalent than commonly thought . One reason may be that few persons have the honesty and courage to vent their emotions and open themselves to criticism as Shelli did . My counseling practice of nearly 40 years ( specializing in problems in which disability is a factor ) currently sees better than 70% of referrals being involved in some way with marital discord resulting from a spouse being disabled . <p> Who knows if this marriage could have been saved ? Perhaps it may have been if there had been sound , sensible premarital counsel and/or early intervention and close follow-up to escape the common pitfalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disability . But to whom could you or this couple turn ? <p> Look to the page after page of counselors in your Yellow Pages or perhaps your priest , rabbi , or minister ? Unfortunately , very few of these professionals are experienced or knowledgeable regarding the unique problems provoked by a disability . It is unfortunate that there is not a nationwide network of Al-anon type support groups for caregivers ! However , for even the wisest of counsel to be effective the persons involved must 1 ) recognize they have a problem , 2 ) desire to solve it , and 3 ) seek competent advice . <p> So with pen in hand my eyes searched this ACCENT article to see if there were any obvious red flags . There were more than I had expected . Of course there were those common-to-all ones such as unrealistic dreams and love-conquers-all , but then there were those unique to care giving such as lost identity , the " trap " of care giving , guilt , despair , resentfulness , endless demands , and misplaced anger . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unfortunate that those same professionals who advised her of bum-out did n't follow up with advice how to avoid it . Perhaps they did but it was ignored . The most simple medicine for burnout is respite  --  getting away from the day-to-day responsibility of whatever it is that is burning you out such as finding employment and paying for your respite . No matter how much devotion and love there is , it is humanly impossible to be tied constantly to anyone twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week without suffering burn-out . This also includes the parents of children with disabilities . <p> In care giving it is too easy to fall into a rut . A rut is a grave with both ends knocked out . It is caused by continuously doing the same thing over and over . So often these demands come from persons with a disability who somehow have developed the idea that the world , society , and especially their spouses owe them something for the losses caused by disability . Therefore , the demands are deserved as a pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endless demands often stem from a thoughtless or thankless heart . Disability in itself breeds selfishness ; the treatment or cure is for family and friends to not cave in to it . Behavior that is rewarded will continue ! <p> My disability does not stem from a SCI , and rather than being a quad , I am a post-polio paraplegic . However , if I get a little too demanding my wife has learned to tell me sweetly to do it myself or wait until she has time . She is not my slave ; she is my wife and partner , and I had better do my share of the work , mental or physical . Marriage is a two-way street , and unless there is an agreement on the division of labor , there will be trouble . <p> There are many givers of total care who will agree with me as to the necessary attitude of both the caregiver and the receiver of care . As long as the person receiving the care is thoughtful and thankful , this effort can be rewarding . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for discussion and change . There certainly is a trap in care giving , but it can and should be avoided . Do n't allow yourself to be motivated by guilt or duty . <p> Actually , Shelli discovered the solution to her own problem , but it was hindsight  --  too late to save the marriage . She gave us good advice in her final paragraphs . Perhaps it could be marriage-saving advice to some of you m the same situation . Do n't abdicate your role as spouse for that of caregiver . Beware of the " Florence Nightingale " syndrome . Please seek help . <p> What would you or I do under similar circumstances ? It would be my hope that we would seek competent advice from someone who has personally been there , preferably one who has been successful in making the necessary adjustments . <p> In this business of disability , academic credentials do n't shine too brightly . Rather , as the Phillips Petroleum slogan says , " It 's Performance That Counts .

Advice From Others Who Have Been There <p> In the last issue ( Su , ' 92 , p. 36 ) SheIli Ivie told about how her marriage failed because she fell into a care-giving trap . We asked readers to share what they thought could have saved this marriage . Following are excerpts from a few of the answers we received . ACCEPT THE FINEST COUNSEL <p> I was divorced by my first wife a year after the car accident that left me a C8/T1 quad . Neither one of us could handle my disability . I am now happily married to an unusually kind and good-looking able-bodied woman . I have become an ordained minister and perform marriage ceremonies . It is my privilege to unite able-bodied couples , inter-racial couples , and couples where one or both are disabled . My sole criteria is a couple 's willingness to apply Bible principles in their shared lives . I strongly believe that SheIli Ivie 's marriage could have been saved if she and her husband had accepted the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , the inspired Word of God . To give but one example , regarding SheIli Ivie 's burn-out : 1 Peter 1:13 urges Christians to " Keep ( their ) senses completely , " or , as the footnote rendering of this verse puts it , " keep balanced . " To take on an inordinate share of work could wear you out and , in the long run , nurture resentment . Christian balance will also help you cope with your limitations as well as those of your family members . J. Glasser , New York <p> YOU EACH NEED YOUR OWN LIFE <p> In 1988 , I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . Within a year I was a total paraplegic . I needed an aide . My lover got fed up with my mood swings . But our biggest problem ? Taking our anger out on each other , not the disease . I also found that each of you need your own life . It is double work and both of you have to put things on hold . M. Luger , New York <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article that the husband 's disability was the result of a drinking and driving auto crash where he was a passenger . Was the husband also drinking at the time of the crash ? Did alcohol or other drug use occur during the years post injury by either the wife or husband ? If alcohol or other drugs were being used by either to deaden psychic or physical pain there is a chance that neither one of them could successfully cope with the emotional changes caused by a traumatic injury . This is a problem that is typically ignored by the directly affected individuals , friends , and professionals . The Institute on Alcohol , Drugs , and Disability is working to educate the disabled community and advocate for changes in national policy to alleviate the alcohol and other drug problems in the disability community . Anyone interested in specific information can contact the Resource Center on Substance Abuse Provention and Disability , 1331 F St. NW Suite 800 , Washington DC 20077- 1514 . A. Tusler , President <p> DO N'T LOSE YOUR IDENTITY <p> I am a wheelchair user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each person must have his/her " own space . " While I 'm sure there are lasting marriages with one person largely being a caregiver , that individual of necessity loses much of his/her own identity . Although most clergymen and psychologists , etc. have little understanding of the problems of the disabled , it is unfortunate this couple did not at least make the attempt at marriage counseling or the like . Even if unsuccessful , the feelings of guilt would have been reduced . If the couple tried talking with others in a similar situation , sharing experiences , outreached to disabled groups in their area , they might have found a solution or compromise which would have saved the marriage . Their story is especially unfortunate since the couple seems genuinely to have cared for each other . R. Kasper , New Jersey <p> A VIEW FROM BOTH SIDES <p> I have been on both sides of the fence . In 1951 I was diagnosed as having polio . The first six months I became a clinging vine and did n't want my husband out of my sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reverse.I was becoming the care-giver and my husband the victim . Through the years , alcohol was becoming more of a problem and so was his fast-developing character disorder . He had a heart attack and developed osteomyelitis and had amputations . His character disorder became bad enough that I was fearful of him and instituted separation proceedings . I was let out of a dreadful prison . My stepfather came to live with me after I separated from my husband . He became terminally ill and I am once again in the role of caregiver . As Ivie wrote in her article , the caregiver 's personality becomes absorbed by the person cared for . There were times I wanted to destroy myself . Becoming a born-again Christian is the way to Life . We are reprogrammed when we give our life to the Lord . Despite being a caregiver for my stepfather , I am fighting to remain independent and am doing it with the help of prayer and faith . D. Schultz , North Carolina <p> IT TAKES LOVE <p> My wife of 23 1/2 years had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quad . She is my nurse , doctor , caregiver and aids me in getting in and out of bed . It takes a lot for a woman to stand by her man when he is in my condition but that goes back to " love . " R. Goodwin , Louisiana <p> <p> <p>
