Clinton , Bush and Perot are slugging it out for the presidency . The nation seems largely unmoved by the quincentenary of Columbus 's encounter with the Americas . Films such as The Crying Game are packing them in coast-to-coast . And in Bloomington , Illinois , joel Philip Myers is brooding . What does he have to brood about ? He is a distinguished professor at Illinois State University , the head of a glass program he built from the ground up beginning in 1970 . He is 58 years old , a successful artist whose Contiguous Fragmentseries , begun in 1978 , is highly prized and avidly collected . His work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer home in Denmark , where he and his wife spend four months a year . He is an assured master of modern studio glass with an honored place within its history and every prospect of continuing as such . Few things in art can be more difficult to analyze than why an artist makes a pronounced shift in his work . Sometimes there 's a sense that a visual idea has been exhausted , or there 's boredom , or a need to challenge oneself , or just plain cantankerousness . For Myers it was all of that , but he also locates some of his thinking in 1992 as coming out of his teaching . " I was always telling students to take risks , to go out on a limb , to try out new ideas , to challenge themselves , and yet all the while I was in the studio continuing with the Contiguous Fragments . I needed to get away from the seduction of color , to get away from my facility with glass . " And so Myers stopped making glass , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his retirement in 1997 and has recently relocated to Pennsylvania . ) Between 1992 and 1995 he canceled all exhibitions and turned his furnace off . He immersed himself in what had been a long-standing interest in the history of World War I , visiting battle sites and cemeteries in Europe , ceasing to make art in orderto cleanse his aesthetic , to unlearn his facileness . It would be three full years before the fires to create would draw him back to the studio-with fascinatingly different results . Banished would be the syrupy sensuality of the Contiguous Fragment series . Gone would be their smooth , streamlined curves , their glistening sweeps in a refined collage of rich and variegated color , their consummate formal beauty , their lissome shapes that rendered the vessel motif with great elegance and poise . In work begun in 1995 , Myers turned away from creating individual pieces and moved toward arranging installations of vertical mold-blown glass objects he called cylindrical forms orvessels ( he objects to their being called truncated bottles ) , which he grouped seven to a pedestal . These groupings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as eight , have dispensed with color ; they are all black or white . In the installation titled " Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer 's horse / Scratches its innocent behind on a tree " ( from W. H. Auden 's " Musee des Beaux Arts " ) , the forms are lined up in sober array , the smoothness of the glass repeatedly pierced with an assault of small metal pins that are embedded in the glass like spiky hairs , and occasionally rent as well with simulated bullet holes . Regimented and somewhat militaristic ( though not as violent to the touch as the description might indicate ) , this work-which has only been exhibited abroad , in 1997 and 1998-was the first foray into the quasi-figural for Myers . While certainly not individual personages , the vertical elements in the cylindrical forms suggest the fetishized body , and their absorption of a kind of pain and damage indicates a degree of human pathos and empathy , perhaps an extension of the artist 's concerns about war and carnage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 Myers has developed three distinct bodies of work from aspects of the cylindrical forms . Of these , the Dialogue series is the most effusive and surprising : multipieced assemblages ( sometimes comprising as few as two elements , or as many as nine ) that enact remarkable dramas and intimations of the human comedy . Myers blows the glass in cylindrical molds made of ceramic insulating material that he has cut and joined to create the forms he desires-the angle where the sections of the mold have been joined suggest hips , necks and heads . These vessels have a simple but wonderful contrapposto ; hinge-like shifts in articulation give them an anthropomorphic body language that invites narrative interpretations . Myers makes each assemblage monochromatic , concentrating on a narrow range of frosted white , pale red , yellow or blue . The bottle/human shapes accrete as if they are family units and , as their title indicates , engaged in conversation . In Dialogue #iz two reddish cylindrical elements seem to turn their backs to each other , hinting at a quarrel , a gulf that can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frosted white elements suggests a teeming urban crowd , an audience , a random gathering of individuals . ( Myers has no objection to rearranging the forms within each work , so the display silhouette is not fixed but can be adjusted to provide an infinity of scenarios . ) With pictorial economy and keen insight into how sensitized we are to reading groupings of bodies , Myers has created a remarkably evocative series . In his Enticementseries , Myers has sexed it up a bit . A straight and unhinged bottle shape , usually of frosted clear glass , is punctuated about halfway up its shaft by a colorful circle or gem of glass that partially enters the form through an aperture-a kind of eye candy . The bright ruby red or sapphire blue of this lozenge , this small but intense pastille , changes the bottle into something more related to a still life tradition , something more controlled and compositional than the Dialogue works .

The colors-usually blue , red and brown-meander about , staining the glass in lovely pools of chroma that bring to mind evocative landscapes . Can Joel Philip Myers 's recent investigations be linked with the earlier efforts that brought him acclaim ? Yes . But it would be difficult to do so merely by referring to the trappings of style . What Myers attempted to do in the early 1990s was to break the chain of habit in order to allow new aspects of himself to come to the surface , to interrupt one procedure to enable another to exist . The hiatus and subsequent resurgence was risky and radical . In the end he found a new beginning , one that complements his earlier achievement . Both past and present are united by the earnestness of his commitment . Myers is compelled to drive his concerns to their ultimate solutions , whether or not doing so involves beauty or meaning or a precious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E Photograph Works from Joel Philip Myers 's Dialogue , Enticement and Color Study series were in a solo exhibition at Marx-Saunders Gallery , Ltd. , Chicago , Illinois , March 26-April 26 .
