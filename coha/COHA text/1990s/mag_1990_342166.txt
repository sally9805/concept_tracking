Network programmers like to think of themselves as wacky guys . Just look at the shows they put on the air . In NBC 's The Fanelli Boys , four grownup brothers move back to Brooklyn to live with . . . their mother ! In CBS 's Evening Shade , a man is nonplussed when his wife tells him she 's pregnant ; he 's already had a vasectomy ! ( Rim shot . ) In Fox 's Good Grief , Howie Mandel plays a nutty guy who does TV commercials for ( hold on to your hats ) a mortuary ! <P> Had enough ? Now try switching instead to Maniac Mansion , a family sitcom that is not so much off the wall as out of this world . Dad is a mishap-prone inventor whose botched experiments have turned his brother-in-law into a housefly and his four-year-old son into a 250-lb. clone of Benjy in The Sound and the Fury . We learn these things in the show 's 10th-anniversary special  --  a nostalgia trip that takes place , oddly , on the program 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , virtually unnoticed , on cable 's Family Channel , a new incarnation of the old Christian Broadcasting Network . <P> Comedy is the gasoline that keeps the networks ' engines humming , but the octane level seems especially low this fall . Of the 17 new sitcoms introduced by CBS , NBC , ABC and Fox , not a single one ranks in the Nielsen Top 30 . Is there a comedy glut ? Or , more likely , are viewers simply recoiling against network packaging that has grown so boringly rote and predictable that all signs of life have drained out ? If so , relief is at hand : increasingly offbeat shows are cropping up in out-of-the-way places on the dial . Some deserve their obscurity . Others might shrivel in the glare of too much mass-audience attention . But what they all share is an eccentric , homemade , try-anything quality . <P> My Talk Show , a syndicated late-night half-hour , is homemade in a literal sense . The premise is a throwback to that old Mary Hartman spinoff , Fernwood 2-Night : a housewife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wis. , has turned her living room into the set for a nightly talk show . It 's a homey affair : her brother-in-law is the announcer ; gray-haired Mrs. Battle , her old school nurse , is musical director ; neighbors drop by to chat . So do real-life celebrities such as William Shatner and Florence Henderson . <P> This reductio ad absurdum of TV 's talk-show mania has had funny sequences , like Jim Belushi joining in an inept neighborhood game of charades : while the women whiz through titles like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , the men are stumped by Jaws . But the **29;10326;TOOLONG satire falls a little flat . My Talk Show is too straitlaced and good-natured ; it needs a bit of the rudeness of Late Night with David Letterman . Or at least some quirkier performers . Where have you gone , Louise Lasser ? <P> Mystery Science Theater 3000 has origins in the heartland as well : the show began life on a Minneapolis UHF station before being picked up last November by cable 's Comedy Channel . Crummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unspooled in their entirety , while three characters  --  one human being and two gabby robots  --  offer wisecracking commentary at the bottom of the screen .
