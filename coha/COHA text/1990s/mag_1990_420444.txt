Section : U.S. News The White House plots an aggressive , partisan challenge to save his foundering Presidency <p> It took only two breathtaking weeks for George Bush to sink into a quagmire of indecision and ineptitude . It could take him the rest of his Presidency to dig out . Bush not only is limping toward a budget deal that probably will have little or no impact on the faltering economy ; he also remains on the defensive against Democratic charges that he is a lap dog for the rich . His approval ratings have dropped 20 points , and the public and Congress are beginning to question his hitherto sacrosanct policies in the Persian Gulf . In short , his Presidency is in danger . <p> These woes are forcing White House strategists to switch directions . There is a growing realization that the President 's domestic agenda is basically nonexistent . His " governing " strategy , which is based vaguely on getting things accomplished rather than articulating a forceful program , is fatally flawed and he desperately needs what some aides call " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of things to come is clear . " The age of the offered hand , " which the President proclaimed at his inauguration , is about to end . A more confrontational stance will take its place . Bush advisers predict that , even though head knocking is not the President 's style , he will reluctantly adopt a more hard-line approach toward his adversaries , as he did in his 1988 campaign . " We 'll look back on 1990 as the final experiment in compromise , ' says a Bush adviser . " The President has been too trusting and the Democrats have kicked him in the butt every chance they got . ' <p> The first phase of the new strategy was conceived by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu . It involves drawing increasing contrasts with the Democrats on issues such as federal " re-regulation , " which Bush opposes , and getting tough on crime . Sununu 's opening volley came on television last week , when he lashed out at the Democrats for being " addicted to tax increases . " Bush himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition party at campaign stops in Texas and the Midwest , arguing that Americans should be " fed up " with Washington ( read " Democrats ' ' ) . Beyond the usual campaign sniping , however , Sununu is beginning to consider a substantive long-range plan . <p> Some Bush advisers have such a blueprint ready . They want him to adopt a comprehensive give-'em-hell approach that would mean taking on Washington as an outsider and attacking a wide range of " special interests . " Such a mantle seems inappropriate for Bush , a quintessential Washington insider and inveterate accommodator . But some conservative hard-liners , including Vice President Dan Quayle , argue that nothing less than an anti-Establishment " reform agenda " is needed to reinvigorate the administration and the Republican Party . <p> Paradigm found . Members of the administration 's " new paradigm " cadre , as they call themselves , meet for breakfast every Friday . They include William Kristol , Quayle 's chief of staff ; deputy White House domestic adviser Charles Kolb , and domestic-policy planner James Pinkerton . Bush 's recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their natural allies include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp , drug czar Bill Bennett , Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater and perhaps presidential pollster Robert Teeter . The more optimistic " new paradigmers " expect that Sununu and Bush eventually will adopt their ideas , especially if they conclude the administration needs a complete makeover for Bush 's 1992 re-election bid . <p> The " reform agenda " - or " new paradigm " - would take aim at various establishments : The congressional establishment through a term-limitation amendment and campaign reform ; the education establishment by increasing parents ' choices of where they school their children through use of education vouchers ; the liberal establishment by requiring tougher penalties for more crimes , and the legal establishment through product-liability reform . The ideas are not new , but the packaging is . The central premise is not to find totally new directions but to make Bush stand for something . <p> There are , of course , serious problems with these strategies . With the notable exception of foreign affairs , Bush has shown little creativity or willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep recession , no reform agenda short of an economic recovery will help him . Just as important , given the White House 's flawed performance this month , there are serious doubts whether the administration is even capable of reinventing its raison d'etre . Last week , the President was caught in another embarrassing flip-flop , first promising to shut down the government if Congress failed to pass an acceptable budget deal , then reversing himself and signing a stopgap spending bill . <p> GOP losses . Bush clearly must try something new . There is scattered evidence from the field that some of the President 's campaign appearances are actually backfiring , as support for his candidates drops after he has visited . Some GOP strategists now fear the party might lose a dozen seats in the House and possibly a few Senate seats on Election Day , weakening Bush 's hand on Capitol Hill and perhaps depriving him of his most potent weapon - the sustainable veto . Only 57 percent of Americans approve of Bush 's handling of Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , a troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Times/CBS News poll . And , most ominously for Bush , GOP poll taker Richard Wirthlin says the economy has become the nation 's No.1 issue for the first time since the 1983 recession , with 35 percent listing it as their top concern . The annual rate of inflation jumped to 9.5 percent in September , twice the rate for 1989 , prompted by rising oil prices . " Bush is in deep trouble , " says a Republican strategist . <p> For their part , the Democrats say they have been reborn . Buried under the defeated budget package was a unifying theme - fairness . And party leaders are confident that they have an opening to attack the tax-code changes sought by Bush because they disproportionately help the rich . " The American people want to tax the rich , ' says House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski . By the end of the week , Democrats and the White House were each looking for ways to claim the issue . It 's possible the final budget deal could give Bush a victory by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while allowing Democrats to claim credit for slapping a tax surcharge on the rich . Gasoline taxes could rise modestly . That leaves the fairness issue up for grabs . <p> The politics of race . But it 's not a sure winner for Democrats . In fact , a considerable number of middle-class voters are more angry about paying taxes for programs for the poor than they are about how light the tax burden is on the rich . Such sentiment does not show up in the polls because it has much to do with race . But it appears to be real , as illustrated by the remarkable political appeal of former Ku Klux Klan leader and self-styled Republican David Duke , who drew 60 percent of the white vote in the recent Louisiana Senate race . The White House dismisses Duke as a racist and a kook . But there is no doubt that Bush and his aides are paying strict attention to the politics of white resentment , and it drives some of his thinking about how to handle the 1990 Civil Rights Act . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill but finding an overall governing strategy for the rest of his term . He performs best when driving toward clear-cut objectives , whether bombing a Japanese installation at Chichi Jima during World War II or organizing a worldwide coalition to stop Saddam Hussein in Saudi Arabia . Bush told the 1988 Republican national convention that he is " a man who sees life in terms of missions - missions defined and missions completed . ' Yet as President , he is a man without a mission heading an administration without a purpose . His more savvy advisers realize he must construct a rationale for his Presidency - very soon . <p> Picture : Soak the rich . Democrat Rostenkowski 's battle cry , LINDA L.

Bush campaigns for Texas Republican Clayton Williams as he tries to find his new voice to take on Democrats next year , JEROME DELAY - AFP <p> By Kenneth T. Walsh and Gloria Borger <p> Quayle watch LOOK WHO MADE SENSE <p> Dan Quayle is one of the few Bush administration officials to emerge from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's initial skepticism about whether the budget summit could succeed looks prescient today . So does his argument that the White House needed to stake out a clearly defined position in the talks rather than pursue a vague set of objectives - a strategy that led to Bush 's disastrous flip-flops on taxes . <p> Quayle 's outspokenness in private White House meetings is a sharp departure from the way Bush behaved as Vice President . The most notable showdown came when Quayle cross-examined White House Chief of Staff John Sununu , his ally on most issues , at a recent cabinet meeting over budget strategy . Quayle 's point was that the White House was unable to explain " what we stand for , " and Republican candidates were suffering as a result . Sununu argued that the best course was continued support for the original budget package . Most observers think Quayle won the exchange . <p> Aides say Bush is more impressed than ever with Quayle 's political judgment and his public performances . The President is said to be increasingly willing to listen to the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1992 campaign . Some Washington insiders even think Quayle may have ensured his place on the 1992 ticket . <p> Voter doubts ? While Quayle 's status is growing on the budget , there was no evidence that he had much influence over Bush 's decisions in the crisis in the Gulf , even though Quayle is a self-styled foreign-policy expert . More important , his poll ratings remain embarrassingly low , with fewer than half of Americans approving his job performance . And the electorate is likely to be a tougher crowd than the Washington establishment . <p> Picture : New job security .
