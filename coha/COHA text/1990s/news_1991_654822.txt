<p> AS Shiites and Kurds battle the regime of Saddam Hussein and Iraqi opposition parties try to patch together a democratic future , the United States finds itself in the awkward position of , in effect , supporting continuing one-party rule in Iraq . <p> US government statements , including those of President Bush , have stressed the desire to see Saddam Hussein overthrown , but not to see Iraq broken apart by civil strife . At the same time , Bush administration officials have insisted that democracy is not currently a viable alternative for Iraq . <p> " The US has an absolute preference for a parliamentary democracy , but it 's not going to happen , " says one administration official , defending the policy . " So I suppose that if there 's going to be another strongman , we 'd prefer a military man over a wild-eyed Islamic type . " <p> " The Americans would prefer to have another Assad , or better yet , another Mubarak in Baghdad , " says a European diplomat , referring to the military-backed regimes of Hafez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American position is that democracy is not a possibility now . " <p> This may account for the fact that thus far , the administration has refused to meet with Iraqi opposition leaders in exile , even though the governments of Turkey , Saudi Arabia , France , and Britain have done so . <p> Critics of US policy say Washington is mishandling the situation and that support for dictatorship could jeopardize long-term US interests in the region if opposition elements win out . <p> Behind US words and actions lies a fear that anti-Saddam revolts in the Shiite south and the Kurdish north could herald either a takeover by Shiites close to Iran or the possible dismemberment of the Iraqi state by Iran , Turkey , and Syria . <p> For the last 23 years , secular military-backed regimes have held together Iraq 's disparate communities - including the Kurds and the Shiites , who number 55 percent of the population . <p> " We 've always favored the territorial integrity of Iraq , " says the administration official , pointing out that Kurdish parties have historically advocated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our goals . " <p> Another administration official says Washington could win the Gulf war but lose the political battle in the region if Iraq is not preserved as a " modern polity . " <p> Since the beginning of the crisis , the US has been concerned that Saddam 's defeat on the battlefield could trigger dismemberment , further destabilizing the region . The US also opposes the formation of an Islamic republic that could fan anew the flames of fundamentalism , a threat the Arab states thought they had licked when Iraq fought Iran to a standstill in their eight-year war . Arab and US agendas After the coalition victory , US concerns seemed to be borne out as rebels in the south and north sparked local uprisings against the regime . US officials say the situation is too fluid to forecast . But , as some see it , continued one-party or military rule would preclude the possibility of dismemberment or Islamic rule . <p> " The Arabs and the US have the same agenda , " says a coalition diplomat . " We want Iraq in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept Saddam in Baghdad in order to have Iraq as one state . " <p> But critics charge that the US is misreading the situation or letting its policy be determined by those of its Arab allies . <p> " I 'm making an argument that you ca n't look to another military dictator , " says Laurie Mylroie , a specialist on Iraq and author of a recent bestseller on Saddam Hussein . " What the US has done is to leave it to the Saudis , and the Saudis prefer a military government . If the revolt in Iraq succeeds , the US will have supported the Saudis , " not the Iraqi people , she says . This position " is not consistent with our values . " <p> Iraqi Shiite aims In addition , Ms. Mylroie says , the Shiites in southern Iraq are not pro-Iran : " The revolt is anti-Saddam and not pro-anything . The Iraqi Shiites are different from the Iranians . It has to do with being Arab and secular . " <p> Mylroie says the US should state that any new regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US policy maintain that Washington is being pragmatic . They say the US is unable to influence Iraqi politics because the US Army did not go all the way to Baghdad . Some argue that a weakened Saddam in the presidency will be no threat to neighboring countries , or that a new military or Baath party leader could be " leaned upon " to be more humane . <p> " Another military man is not going to be a Saddam , " says Richard Murphy , a former assistant secretary of state for the Middle East and now at the Council on Foreign Relations . " The Baath Party and the military are the only in-country institutions today . They have been deformed by Saddam into personal tools . But they might prevent Iraq from blowing apart . " <p> In addition , some Middle East experts doubt that the Iraqi opposition parties - more than 20 recently met in Beirut - will be able to achieve a consensus . <p> " The leaders of the respective factions go back 20 years outside Iraq . They are very diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems they are going to have in constituting a valid opposition are great . If they need so much outside support , what does that tell you about their ability to govern ? " <p> Nicholas Veliotes , another former assistant secretary , adds : " You 've got the problem of the Saudis , " who would be furious if the US supported democracy . Mylroie and others say the US should not defer to the Saudis . <p> Consequences of war Rashid Khalidi , associate professor of Middle East studies at the University of Chicago , says the US should have considered the repercussions before going to war . " We ignored the consequences of war , " he says . " The people ( in the State Department ) who know about the Arab Middle East , who know the history , the religion , the peoples , and the culture , they have been frozen out . " He was referring to the control of policymaking by a few close aides to Secretary of State James Baker III . <p> " We should n't have destabilized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once you 've created the desert , it 's pretty hard to pretty it up . " <p> Of the current situation in Iraq , Mylroie warns , " There 's a goof looming . If the revolt in the south succeeds , then all the US can do is moan and groan . That 's not policy . "
