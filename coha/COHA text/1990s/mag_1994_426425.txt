<p> Head Start began in 1965 , against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and the fight for civil rights . While 18-year-olds were dying in a war many felt was unjust and schools were struggling to desegregate , some academics and politicians were ( ironically ) focusing on four-year-olds at a time when 32 states did n't even have kindergartens. 1 Had the creators of Head Start waited just a year longer to launch what has become the favorite program of Johnson 's War on Poverty , perhaps there would not have been the political backing ( or financial resources ) to start it . As Edward Zigler has explained , Head Start began before people realized that the Vietnam War would eat up far more than the " extra " revenue that was thought available. 2 Fortunately , for the more than 12.5 million children who have been served by Head Start since 1965 , 3 the program was introduced and has survived despite many setbacks . <p> Head Start , however , has never only served children ; it has always involved parents and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children shows how clearly Head Start understands the importance of the context in which a child grows  --  a subject which has been the focus of many a scholar . Bronfenbrenner , for example , has examined this issue at length , while Bellah , et al . have written on the need for Americans to find a language that reflects their need for community. 5 As Pilisuk and Parks write , whether we " . . . admit it or not , we are part of a larger ecology that sustains us. " 6 Community is an intrinsic human need , and Head Start helps enhance communities by focusing on the needs of two generations . <p> Few programs are better examples of the importance and benefits of such a community focus than are Murray Head Start in Murray , Kentucky , and Inn-Circle in Cedar Rapids , Iowa . Both programs integrate families into wider communities , and bring more community resources into their programs in order to better serve parents and children . Murray seeks to broaden its community outreach and enrich its service offerings through formal collaborations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support services with non-institutional , informal community involvement . <p> Both Inn-Circle and Murray Head Start demonstrate that to foster change in families and to strengthen communities , services to parents  --  such as adult education , family counseling , and job training  --  must go hand in hand with early childhood care and education . They also both maintain that Head Start must integrate low-income families into informal networks and voluntary organizations , and that Head Start must mobilize the wider community to take greater responsibility for meeting the needs of all children and families . Although neither program is able to serve all the income-eligible children in its area , both work toward meeting multiple needs of families and reaching more children  --  indeed , the twin goals of Head Start expansion . Murray Head Start7 <p> When the state of Kentucky passed the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990 ( KERA ) , mandating widespread educational reform and establishing state-sponsored early childhood programs , Murray Head Start chose to expand its program by forming a partnership with public schools . Today Murray Head Start serves nearly 1000 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Start dollars alone . Murray contracts with the school districts to use state funds , while it receives federal Head Start dollars directly to disburse to the sites . <p> Before the passage of KERA , only families with incomes at or below the federal poverty line could receive Murray Head Start services . Yet , parents with slightly higher incomes could still not afford preschool or daycare . Since KERA guidelines allow Murray to serve children who qualify for a free lunch , Murray is able to serve families who in the past could provide few early education services for their children . <p> The collaboration with school districts allows each Murray Head Start site to maximize community resources to serve more children . Indeed , although Head Start children each receive $3,130 per year , while KERA children receive only $2,285 per year , all of the children served through Murray Head Start receive exactly the same services . This is possible due to the arrangement between Head Start and the public schools : Since classes are housed in the public schools , Head Start saves money by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use those funds to provide social and health services to children funded through KERA . This collaboration has also increased Murray Head Start teachers ' pay , lowered staff turnover , and attracted high quality teachers to the program . Children in the eight counties served by Murray Head Start benefit from this collaboration , and the public school community has become much more involved in , and aware of , Head Start . <p> Through its collaborations with community service agencies and the schools , Murray Head Start provides children with Head Start , transportation and health services , help with transition to public school , immunization tracking , and some wraparound daycare . Parents at Murray Head Start can receive adult education , literacy and GED classes , counseling , and job training . One collaboration in particular , with the Kentucky Integrated Delivery System ( KIDS ) , has helped Murray achieve smoother service delivery , fewer caseloads , and more service offerings . An established partnership of social service agencies in three of the counties served by Murray Head Start , KIDS agencies include county and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments for Social Services and Social Insurance , the Health Department , Vocational Rehabilitation , the courts ' juvenile services division , and Western Kentucky Regional Mental Health-Mental Retardation Board , Inc. 8 <p> The Murray Head Start Policy Council , like the KIDS collaboration , also ensures that the program remains grounded in the community . The Council , composed of one parent and one community representative from each of the 11 school districts served by Murray , provides a forum for keeping service providers and parents aware of each other 's concerns . Many parents who participate in the Policy Council feel empowered by the experience , and say their role has a positive effect on their community . As one parent said , " being Policy Council President has given me a chance to be a leader in the community . . . " <p> Murray Head Start director Judy Whitten believes that by willingly embracing change both in how it delivers services and to whom it provides them , Murray has improved access to preschool education for children in Kentucky , and has opened up new education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , she says , is underscored by the conviction that all children deserve " the best , not second-rate . " Inn Circle <p> Part of the Hawkeye Area Community Action Program ( HACAP ) , Inn-Circle is a transitional housing facility for 44 homeless single parents and their children . HACAP provides 452 children with Head Start , 32 of whom live at Inn-Circle and receive year-round Head Start and daycare while their parents work or pursue education or job training . This arrangement of services to homeless parents and children has been successful largely due to active community involvement in the program , and to a vision of community integration for all Inn-Circle residents . <p> Indeed , the Inn-Circle program began as , and continues to be , a community project. 9 After a local citizens ' advisory group formed in 1990 to address the problem of homeless families in Cedar Rapids , HACAP applied for and won a homeless demonstration grant sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) . The group then located an empty 122-unit motel in Cedar Rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units into one-and two-bedroom apartments . A construction company , Berry Development Corporation , formed a new non-profit agency  --  BDC Charity Corporation  --  and set up a lease/purchase program that will eventually allow HACAP to own the property . Community businesses , churches , and voluntary associations then donated furnishings and equipment for a playground ; local college students raised funds for the renovation ; and high school students babysat while others worked on the units . <p> Inn-Circle is funded by HUD , the United Way , the Community Service Block Grant , Head Start , the Iowa Department of Education At-Risk Program , the Emergency Housing Grant Program , the McKinney Fund , the Iowa State Emergency Shelter Fund , and local businesses , individuals , and residents. 10 Inn-Circle also receives in-kind contributions from WIC , Kirkwood Community College , the Visiting Nurses Association , and businesses and churches . <p> By collaborating with 12 community social service agencies , Inn-Circle provides parents with GED classes , literacy and other adult education opportunities , job training , substance abuse and mental health counseling , and advice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprise a case management team , and their partnership with Inn-Circle allows both HACAP and Inn-Circle , as institutions , to be better connected to the wider community . Through these formal connections , Inn-Circle remains informed of services and opportunities that its residents can use . Equally important , these links to outside agencies help Inn-Circle exemplify a two-fold understanding of " community " : to those inside , and outside , its own walls . <p> Inn-Circle 's Community Interdependence Model- Inn-Circle is devoted to strengthening the interpersonal networks and associational life of its residents . Its innovative Community Interdependence Model ( see box ) encourages Inn-Circle service providers and recipients to see each other as reciprocal contributing members of their community , rather than simply as people who give , or people who receive , services . Caring for each other as neighbors is an important part of all Inn-Circle 's programs . Parents will , for example , often watch each other 's children , clean and paint a new resident 's apartment , or volunteer in the Inn-Circle daycare center  --  indeed , such tasks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents are also encouraged to create their own associations  --  one woman formed a support group for survivors of domestic violence . <p> Chris Carman , Director of HACAP-Head Start , explains that the Community Interdependence Model came about because HACAP recognizes that all families need support from and involvement with , their community. 13 Carman notes that , " . . . none of us is truly self-sufficient . . . In order for a family to appear to be self-sufficient , it needs to have those interdependent connections - with the PTA , the Scouts , the neighborhood association . . . If we 're going to move families from dependency , we need to look at what things are in the community that would make them ongoing members of that community and not just human service recipients . " 14 <p> Inn-Circle guides residents to become connected to the wider community by ensuring that they have supportive networks in place before they leave the formal , institutional help of Inn-Circle . Upon leaving Inn-Circle , residents have established support systems that they helped to create . <p> Focusing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is also key to strengthening parents ' skills and their ability to work in different settings . For example , Inn-Circle often encourages parents to form groups around particular tasks , such as raising funds to improve a playground or to maintain the facility . By tying parent activities to the maintenance of the Inn-Circle community , 15 residents learn to manage projects on their own rather than rely on staff for directions . <p> As Wayne Woods , Director of Inn-Circle , says about the Community Interdependence Model , " We spend lots of time helping people rely on each other . We do nothing that is n't organized around their strengths . " 16 Woods and his staff have found that often the improved self-esteem that results from a successful project conceived and carried out by parents themselves helps parents deal more effectively with personal and family issues . <p> Inn-Circle staff have learned that participating in neighborhood associations and voluntary groups , in addition to being able to obtain formal services , help reduce families ' stress and help create a home-community context conducive to healthy family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , has decreased participants ' reliance on social services , minimized caseload stress and the need for more service referrals , and helped residents implement security measures for their own community safety . Conclusion <p> Both Murray Head Start and Inn-Circle show that despite the integral role of Head Start in improving the lives of children , building a village to raise a child requires more than just Head Start . Joblessness , low wages , poor housing , crime , school quality , lack of transportation , substance abuse , and poor health care are just some of the pervasive problems facing millions of families . Ensuring the benefits of Head Start is difficult without stronger collaborative partnerships . <p> However , both programs illustrate how Head Start can become a hub of collaborations intended to create a village hospitable to all families . Inn-Circle and Murray show that it is possible to shift from a program to a system perspective of serving communities. 17 That is , family support and community enhancement are best accomplished through strengthening the programmatic connections between Head Start , schools , community agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other will continue to have fractured success , and will usually fail to make significant improvements to the wider community as a whole . <p> Yet , since improving parents ' welfare helps children maintain the benefits of early education , 18 Head Start 's continued success in empowering communities may well be contingent on how well it meets parents ' needs . The most successful Head Start programs will likely be those that maintain a community vision , and whose services to parents are as strong as their services to children .
