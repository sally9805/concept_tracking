THE NETHERLANDS IS MADE FOR TOURING ON TWO WHEELS // I was lucky I 'd lost my way , taking the wrong ferry across the River Lek . With a few extra kilometers to cycle the river road , I let my anticipation build as I approached the famous 19 windmills of Kinderdijk . Above me to the right rose a grassy dike where , almost within arm 's reach , sheep ruminated on my passing . On the reclaimed land below sea-level at my left , tidy brick houses with their gardens stood window-level to the road . Sun , welcome after a rain shower , warmed my back . Soon , across lush , flat pastureland and beyond trees kept in scale by pollarding , the windmills appeared in proud silhouette . Most of them flanked a single canal , punctuating almost the entire horizon . As I pedaled , I had time to marvel at the windmills ' survival since1710 and the work they 'd done to drain the land before me . I stopped to take photographs several times and explored a path leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightened up from his planting and approached the path . In English he pointed out which mill was open for visiting , and explained how the cap of the mill was turned to put the sails to the wind . As we chatted , a woman and her daughter cycled past toward a windmill , evidently their home , the woman riding onehanded , nonchalantly , balancing a white-boxed bakery cake in the other . The old man and I observed a swan nesting in the marsh just beyond . In one week , he said , she would have her babies . At this leisurely , stop-and-start pace I explored the paths that led to each windmill on my side of the canal . Across it I could see tourists and more windmills . But here , undisturbed , I could listen to the wind rustle the marsh grasses and imagine living in a mill , with crocheted curtains at the windows and galoshes waiting upsidedown between the slats of a bench outside the door . Eventually I rode on to the touristed side to view the windmills from new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working interior water wheel and old living quarters with built-in closet beds . Now having to share this special place with tour buses and cars and crowds of people , I felt glad I had discovered it my own way , by bicycle . It was one more personal experience confirming my hunch that cycling is the way to tour the Netherlands . Two summers ago my husband and I had traveled through this lowland country via rental car and almost wore ourselves Photograph A shopkeeper and his grandson on an errand in Edam , known for its cheese and 17th-century architecture .

Our most relaxing day was when we rented bicycles at a city train station , obtained a bike map from the local tourist office and pedaled into the countryside , sampling for the first time the inviting Dutch infastructure of some 10,800 miles of bicycle paths as well as bridges , tunnels , ferry boats and traffic signals dedicated to bicycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable cycling on lightly traveled roads , but we enjoyed getting away from them and turning our full attention to the landscape-pasture silverribboned with drainage ditches like miniature canals , grazing cows everywhere and the graceful patterns of gabled houses , well-kept yards and gardens , iron drawbridges , four-jposted hay sheds , windmills and church spires . With English widely spoken , asking directions or striking up a conversation proved easy . In town and country many Dutch use their bicycles for commuting and errands , so we never felt too isolated and automobile drivers proved considerate when we used the roads . So this spring I gladly returned at tulip time on a press trip to further sample cyclists ' options for seeing the Netherlands . Bicycling through the bulb fields . In April and early May the Netherlands adds another dimension to its landscape , bursting into what you might call an orderly riot of bloom . Particularly in the provinces of North and South Holland , field after field vibrates with intense color . A vast stripe of red tulips , then lemon yellow , then flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a stretch of pink hyacinths . Daffodils in white or yellow . At field 's edge , decadent piles of lopped-off blooms , flowers sacrificed to let the bulbs grow-I watched modem harvest machines sheer them off , and bent-over field workers ( " tulpen koppers " ) do it by hand . Had not a watery ditch separated me from the bloom piles , I would have salvaged a fistful of tulip blossoms and stuck them in my water bottle as a rolling tribute to spring ! An ideal way for American cyclists to breathe in the ambience of the blooming Dutch landscape is to join an organized bicycle tour , leaving the planning to the tour operator . While there are more luxurious options from some American bike tour companies , a more informal and less costly alternative is to go Dutch . The biggest of the Dutch bike tour operators , Cycletours Holland , with whom I pedaled for two days , offers " bike &; boat " tours of four , five and eight days . Sympatico with my own preferences , Cycletours ' typical daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisurely no-hills pedaling , photo- and coffee-breaks , and sightseeing stops along a scenic route on bike paths and low-traffic roads . Even fairly new cyclists can manage these distances well . To cover more miles , riders can strike out on their own for the day with a map and route suggestions . Groups range in size from 20 to 30 persons , with one or two tour leaders . Along with Dutch adults and families , American guests may find themselves pedaling with folks from England , France , Germany , Switzerland or Spain , for example-a real international experience . The boat comes in as accommodations . After a day of cycling , everyone returns to the barge to shower and dress informally for aperatifs and a three-course family-style meal on board-with plenty for hungry appetites . In contrast to many restaurant meals in the Netherlands , our chef told me , the food he serves is more like Dutch home cooking . I enjoyed the appetizers , the hearty salads , the good variety of side dishes , and consoled myself that some people really do prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the chef 's Indonesian meal ( an ethnic specialty in the Netherlands because Indonesia was once a Dutch colony ) . As on many boats , space below deck on the bike barge is precious and cabins are small-big enough for a moderate-sized suitcase and intended to be adequate for sleeping and dressing . Relaxing and socializing are done on deck or in the spacious dining room/lounge . I 'll admit that when I went down to my cabin to sleep the first night , I wondered if I might fall prey to sea-sickness with the boat at anchor , as I am susceptible-but no problem . The slight rocking and the water lapping against the boat did keep me awake for awhile ; the second night , after a day of cycling I did n't even notice . Typical cycling day . A sensible cyclist 's breakfast started us off-granola and other cereals , yogurt , fresh fruit and juice , hard boiled eggs , cold cuts and cheese with rolls and a variety of breads-with ample on the table for those who wished to pack a lunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of everything typically Dutch-including changeable weather . Under cloudy skies we set off on 21-speed hybrids from our port town , Vollendam , on a portion of Cycletours ' Northern route . The rain held off long enough for some of us to explore the old town of Edam ( from which the cheese takes its name ) , while others indulged in coffee and cinnamony Dutch apple pie-one of the country 's national treasures . I was keen on my discovery of a cheese warehouse where cheese wheels the circumference of frisbees were being loaded onto a truck for Brussels . Departing Edam , we cycled along a canal and soon onto a dike through the countryside , past thatched barns and grazing sheep , tulip fields and irrigation ditches afloat with herons , egrets and swans . Our pace was moderate enough to periodically catch our tour leaders wo women involved in bike racing in their free timeand talk ; getting a Dutch perspective enriched the experience for me . Eventually we found ourselves cycling into a rainy headwind just long enough to let us do some paceline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 300-year-old cafe/restaurant in De Rijp . We pedaled into this 17th century village past picturesque wooden-gabled houses and were surprised to learn that the town , once on the Zuiderzee , had been a center for whaling and fishing ; now it 's surrounded by land reclaimed from the sea . After lunch we had sunshine and rural landscape , tulip fields and windmills ( including a windmill museum tour ) , more headwinds and conversation-all part of glorying in the fresh air and pedaling up an appetite for dinner back on board in the handsome cheese market town of Alkmaar . Other options . Like many organized bike tours , the price of this one does not include airfare . Thus participants are free to arrange additional time to see more of the country . One might , for example , spend a few days in a small old city that 's not on the bike tour itinerary ; Delft is one of the most beautiful and historic , with many canals . Haarlem has a similar feel and is well situated in the bulbgrowing district . Both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bike to get out in the country.side . Typically , bikes can be rented inexpensively at or near the train station . Expect Dutch-style one- or three-speed bikes with an upright seating position . If you know your plans a day or so ahead , reserve your bike in advance . Carry I.D . and be prepared to pay a refundable deposit plus the rental fee .

Below : On a grassy dike sheep ruminated on my passing . // Bike maps are available at the local tourist office , called the VVV . The ANWB ( a sister organization to the American Automobile Agency ) provincial maps are excellent . The VVV can also give information about bike rental facilities . As for my Kinderdijk excursion , I was situated in a hotel with its own fleet of three-speeds . And so what if I misinterpreted the hotel 's directions to Kinderdijk ? In this case getting lost was half the fun . If You Go Cycletours Holland says that it 's rare for rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wet , unseasonably cool weather because I took the right gear . One day I actually wore : bike shorts , long tights , short sleeved jersey , long sleeved wool jersey , windbreaker , rain jacket and pants , and two pairs of full-fingered gloves , plus helmet-in early May ! Take your own helmet and consider putting your favorite saddle in the suitcase . During low season ( including tulip time ) an eight-day " bike &; boat " tour with Cycletours was fl070 ( U.S.$570 ) at the time of my trip .
