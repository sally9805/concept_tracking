<p> The fishermen of Cordova , Alaska , risk their lives for some of the world 's last wild salmon , richly oiled Copper River king and sockeye . Arguably the best-tasting salmon in the world , the fish were harvested in record numbers on May 15 , the opening day of the 1997 season . The Food section went along for the ride . <p> CORDOVA , ALASKA <p> At Rhonda 's Hairflair , where a cap frost goes for $ 55 and up , bleary-eyed men in faded oil-stained jeans line up for a double butterscotch latte at 8:30 a.m . This time of year , Cordova 's commercial fishermen still have $ 3.25 for a flavored caffeine blast . But for a $ 16 haircut ? Maybe not . " Everybody is really broke until the salmon season starts , " says owner Rhonda McKenzie . " The charge cards are racked up . " <p> Besides , these rugged guys are busy . Down the hill at the harbor there are nets to be mended , boat engines to be repaired . Opening day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days away . And gillnetters ( the men , and a handful of women , who use nets to trap salmon in the pounding and dangerous surf of the Copper River flats ) go for a shaggy " I just woke up " look anyway . <p> Up and down the floating docks at the municipal harbor , everyone is talking about Net Income , the fishing boat that exploded on C float yesterday afternoon ( the owner escaped with minor injuries ) . The explosion eclipsed talk about the small-plane crash four hours earlier ( no injuries there either ) . The day before , the news was the glacier that shifted , closing down the bridge . But mostly they 're talking about what they always talk about : what price Cordova wholesalers will offer fishermen this year for king and sockeye salmon . This town 's 543 gillnetters have seen prices sink from a high in 1988 of $ 3.20 per pound for sockeye ( or reds , as they call them ) to a measly $ 1.30 last summer . <p> " We 're getting screwed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rhonda Renee . " We 'll strike and sit on the beach like we did last year if we have to . " <p> But McKenzie and the other gillnetters know only too well the complexity of the problem . The world market is flooded at this time of year with wild salmon and with farm-raised salmon , which is available year-round . Total salmon harvests have risen 40 percent in the last five years . The Japanese , who have snapped up the majority of the Copper River harvest over the last decade , now buy only half as much , making up the balance with farm-raised . That 's why McKenzie , like everyone else in town , is holding his breath until this year 's price is announced . And that 's why Cordova looks a tad scruffy . <p> Peeling and faded wood-frame buildings line three-block-long First Street , the main drag . Cordova is no tourist hub . Potholes are everywhere , just like back home . It rains a lot . Moss grows on anything that does n't move . There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , 150 miles southeast of Anchorage on Prince William Sound , can be reached only by boat or air . The jagged snow-capped Chugach Mountains that loom over Cordova are spectacular . Wildlife abounds . But an economy fueled chiefly by a four-month-long salmon-fishing season  --  from kings and sockeyes in May all the way to cohos in August  --  has its highs and lows . <p> And lows Cordova knows . Copper mining came and went . The 1964 Good Friday 9.2 earthquake , the strongest quake ever recorded in North America , destroyed the beds of this former Clam Capital of the World . Twenty-five years to the day later , the nation 's worst technological disaster , the Exxon Valdez oil spill , took place 50 miles away . <p> Cordovans blame the spill for everything from their high divorce rate to the demise of the herring-fishing season . No doubt , the spill was a massive mess , but Cheri Shaw , spokeswoman for the Cordova United Fishermen was " a waking point for the community , " says McKenzie . While helping to clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other trash they used to routinely dump overboard . They do n't do that anymore , says McKenzie . ) In fact , the prized salmon that battle the raging , silt-ridden Copper River in order to spawn in mountain streams are returning in record numbers . <p> The problem is what to do with them . <p> Up until the early 1980s , most of the Copper River catch ended up in cans . ( Much of the total salmon harvest still leaves Cordova frozen . ) But in 1983 , Seattle seafood consultant Jon Rowley began luring Seattle chefs to Cordova to receive the first catch of the season and hustle it home fresh . At the same time , he helped develop the network of the boats and planes it takes to get this " fine-blooded thoroughbred of a fish " off the boats and onto dinner plates as quickly as possible . <p> Rowley says that with " whoops and hollers " he created excitement at Seattle seafood markets . Now supermarkets there hang banners that count down the days . All the hubbub is much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with one difference  --  Copper River salmon is well worth the attention . " Now it 's almost comical , " says Rowley . " Everybody is trying to get that first fish . But there are only so many ways to get out of Cordova . " <p> A gillnetters ' cooperative tried promoting the fresh fish to markets beyond Seattle . But with little capital behind it , that idea went bust . Then , five years ago , a group of fishermen banded together to market Copper River salmon across the country as a quality-controlled fresh fish . ( With 543 boats bringing in the total Copper River catch , proper handling and on-board chilling of every fish can sometimes be neglected . ) They formed Prime Select Seafood , vowing to ship only the best fish available  --  salmon plucked carefully from the net by hand to avoid bruising , held by the mouth not the tail so as not to break the spine , stunned and bled , then chilled quickly . ( Clyde 's Restaurant Group , Sutton Place Gourmet and Arlington Seafood Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> But moving mountains of Copper East is n't easy . <p> " Selling high-end specialty fish is too much work for East Coast wholesalers , " says Prime Select president Jeff Bailey . " Farmed salmon is so abundant and cheap that the margins are n't there . There 's no big money in it . " <p> THURSDAY , 7 P.M. <p> With a mixture of glee ( oh boy ! a boat ride ! ) and deep dread ( I get seasick ) , I join Mike McKenzie for the opening 24-hour fishing period . We 'll be working around the clock with the help of the midnight sun . I 've heard tales of boats being dashed against the sandbars at the mouth of the Copper . It 's Alaska 's most dangerous fishery . But today 's weather forecast calls for sunny skies and a smooth sea . <p> The Rhonda Renee , a 35-foot aluminum craft , has a comfortable cabin . As we speed out to the fishing grounds in a flotilla of assorted one-man boats , I check it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped kitchen ( there 's even an oven ) . McKenzie calls it " my tin can . " But the proper name is " bowpicker "  --  the 900-foot-long , 28-foot-wide gillnet is lowered and rewound off the bow of the boat . Each time the net is positioned , that 's called a " set . " <p> There are as many ways to lay out the nets as there are fishermen . Some " play the bar game , " as McKenzie calls it  --  working the shallow sloughs . Others choose the safer open sea . Either way , the fishermen rely on their knowledge of when the tides rise and fall and of how the salmon move in the currents . And of course they rely on a certain degree of luck . They may return with 1,000 6-pound sockeyes ( not a bad day 's work when the catch brings $ 1.50 per pound  --  do the math ) . They may snag only 100 . From a distance , gillnetting may seem an exciting adventure . But up close , it 's repetitious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " water haul . " McKenzie stands on the bow while the hydraulic winch pulls up the net . Only 14 sockeyes come flying over the bow at first , and McKenzie stops the winch to remove each fish , then ices them down in storage holds below deck . He moves quickly , to get the salmon while they 're still alive  --  and before a sea lion can get them . But the second set , which reaps 230 sockeyes , hints at how the rest of the day will go . <p> McKenzie keeps going , hour after hour . All day and night long the radio crackles , fishermen passing news back and forth , or just passing the time . " Hey , I 'm lonely out here ! Talk to me ! " a voice calls out at one point . Finally the opening price for the fish is announced and passed by radio : $ 1.55 per pound for sockeye , $ 1.75 for king . ( The sockeye price has now dropped to $ 1 per pound . ) <p> McKenzie pulls up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the initial 24-hour harvesting period . The Rhonda Renee has enough space to hold all the fish caught , so he has n't had to offload fish onto one of the wholesalers ' " tender " boats , which prowl the fishing waters buying up the early catch . ( They bag the fish , weigh them and cut a check or hand over cash on the spot . ) <p> Back at Cordova harbor , there is a backup of boats waiting to offload at the wholesale warehouses on the docks , where the fish will be headed and gutted . It will take hours more before people can call it a day . <p> The next day we hear the news : It was the biggest salmon harvest ever . The total count for all the fishing boats during the first 24 hours was 6,400 king and 190,000 sockeye salmon , six times the projected estimate for sockeye . <p> And Cordova 's luck has held out : There 's been only one fishing accident  --  to a first-time gillnetter . Maybe he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept pulling in his net , adding more and more salmon to his boat . It was a great catch  --  until the boat sank under the weight of all those fish . <p> Who Keeps an Eye On the Take ? <p> Alaska 's wild salmon harvest is strictly controlled by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game . Fisheries are managed for the benefit of the fish , not the fishermen . And stocks are thriving . Wild salmon are not endangered in Alaska the way they are in some areas of the Pacific Northwest where logging and the damming of rivers has devastated the fishing industry . The number of permits issued is limited , and they are not cheap . Prices fluctuate from year to year . Presently they are in the $ 75,000 range . <p> Copper River fishing periods are usually 24 to 48 hours long on Monday and Thursday of each week . A sonar detector located 31 miles upriver , which counts fish as they travel upriver to their home spawning streams , gives Fish and Game a daily " escapement " rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvesting hours are lengthened . The fewer the fish making it past the nets out beyond the mouth of the river , the shorter the fishing period . <p> " In order to have a natural spawn , we have to space the fishing periods , " says Slim Morstad , Fish and Game 's area management biologist . " With faster boats , sonar , radar  --  I got to reduce the time they 're catching . " <p> An Adult Salmon 's Life Has One Heck of a Final Chapter <p> After spending several years as beautiful bright-silver adults in the open ocean , feeding on shrimp and small fish , Copper River king and sockeye salmon instinctively know when to head back to the exact place of their birth to lay and fertilize eggs in any one of more than 100 high-mountain streams . Many of the fish that enter the 300-mile-long , milky brown , silty Copper River in May wo n't reach their stream until August . <p> After entering the fresh water in the 60-mile-wide Copper River Delta , the fish stop eating . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy layer of body fat to sustain them on the rigorous journey up the thundering Copper . The longer the genetically encoded trip , the more fat they need . And it 's these natural oils , high in Omega-3 fatty acids , that give these salmon their distinct rich flavor and texture . And that 's why the commercial fishermen catch them before they enter the river and start to use up their fat in their upstream struggle . <p> Weird changes occur in the fish in just a matter of days upon entering the river itself  --  a dramatic Jekyll/Hyde metamorphosis ( I could n't believe it until I saw it myself ) . The salmon become bigger and more aggressive . Their flesh begins to soften . Their silver body color flushes to flame red . Their heads turn a dark green . They absorb their scales to feed from the protein . They grow an ugly hooked nose and a hump on their back . Their teeth lengthen half an inch . It 's not a pretty sight . <p> The strongest and biggest males ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stake out and protect the prime locations , perfect for egg protection , in the gravel-bottomed streams until the females arrive . Salmon do n't pair off . More than one male may fertilize a female 's eggs . Soon after the deed is done , the adult salmon die , decompose and become food for the fry . Yes . That 's right . Baby eats Mommy and Daddy . <p> I took a drive 50 miles outside of Cordova across the Copper River Delta , where dunes of glacial silt and ice form a forbidding moonscape , to get an idea of the kind of terrain these fish face on their trip upstream . <p> After fighting their way through thundering muddy water and rocks , sometimes leaping 10 feet in the air over cascades  --  WHAM !  --  at a bend in the river , up comes Childs Glacier , an eye-popping 300-foot-tall wall of baby-blue ice . Locals ( and bears ) love to hang out at this spot to watch for glacier calvings . That 's when massive slabs of ice break from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cause giant waves that can splash migrating salmon onto the shore . You can guess who usually gets there first .
