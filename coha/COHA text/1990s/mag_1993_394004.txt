It is hard to be a brave , clear witness to the faith today , let alone a missionary or saint . For one thing , what we used to see as charitable outreach may today be seen as  --  and may even be  --  cultural invasion . But more intimately , I think , we are uncertain about our own identity . Let me give you a personal example . When something goes wrong  --  a small disaster  --  I instinctively start to say the Hail Mary . But after the first few peaceful words a voice in my head says : " You 're being childish , asking God  --  and indirectly at that  --  to take care of something you ought to be dealing with . " " But I ca n't control the situation , " my praying voice responds , " and even Eastern holy men recommend the rosary as a mantra to steady the mind . " " Ha ! " says my Western pragmatic voice , " so why do n't you use it instead ? We live in reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in myths ; even Andrew Greeley says so ! " And so it goes . A typical slice of Catholic consciousness . So who are we as believers and what should we be doing ? I do not mean official representatives of the church . I mean ourselves  --  men and women for whom all such roles are temporary garments and who desire , wherever we are , to carry out in our work and lives the ideals of justice and love central to our long tradition . If we are perfectly clear who we are and what we should be doing , I suspect we are either wrong or fooling ourselves . Old roles and slogans wo n't do , nor will many new ones . We have only to look at the language of do-good social and political programs to see why they do not work . Those advocating a " war on poverty " or a " shot in the arm " for a drug program show a lack of understanding of the complex human , social and economic problems they are dealing with . Their programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate language do not connect their imagination or themselves with those they are trying to help . We must go deeper than thought to find a more fundamental identity that relates us to our bodies and our actual experiences . We have to work  --  and pray  --  to become people who can respond both freely and lovingly to our world , trying so painfully to emerge from old gender , class , national and racial identifications into a planetary human community . We know now that we understand things from the position where we stand . So Einstein and others have told us , and it is as true of human , social reality as it is of light waves and planets . For the last 23 years I have been standing in a community college , ostensibly helping students of all ages write about who they are . I have learned much about the search for identity from that experience , and reflection on it has suggested a new description of human beings to me : vulnerable sharers . Since no words carry meaning by themselves , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew . It began in a literature course on mothering . I heard plenty about physical processes and vulnerability there , of course ; it comes with birth and nurture . It made me think of how in Christian history such reality has often been denigrated , considered of lesser value than clean , intellectual knowing . Yet today we realize , as biologist Lewis Thomas says , that thought is only a small part of the life systems that support it . Some readers may have heard of the term " wounded healer " as a description of Jesus and a model for us . My term is different , originating as it does from the experience of mothers rather than from New Testament study . Mothers are physically vulnerable , but wounding does not make them healers . How difficult it will be for the Bosnian women who have been raped to accept themselves , let alone to bring up their children . On the contrary , when mothers can self-confidently reintegrate their thinking and care into their own messy reality  --  and especially when they are equal sharers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others to grow in discipline and love . For many it involves a difficult reeducation in sloughing off old roles and even ideals in order to learn to trust their own vision . It does not work if they feel they are victims . Since I can not reveal the contents of the many personal student papers I have received that demonstrate the point , one might think of the mother in Tillie Olsen 's " I Stand Here Ironing " ( see her collection of stories , Tell Me a Riddle ) or the heroine of Margaret Atwood 's Surfacing , who undergoes such a strenuous spiritual journey in escaping victimization by the conventions of our culture  --  in order to be able to face and give life . Vulnerable sharers are like that . Let me tell you briefly the stories of three of my students to illustrate this new identity I propose . Jim had a heart attack in his late 40 's and had to stay home with his youngest child while his wife worked as a nurse . Disoriented at first , he later wrote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year-old daughter playing on the floor and one day I suddenly noticed how creative she was . She was designing and solving problems , working through difficulties , and then she cleaned up ! I wish I 'd known this when my older children were growing . All I could think of then was  --  O my God ! I hope they 'll keep quiet and clean up the mess . Maybe all children are creative like that . " Jim went back to school three months after he wrote that paper to study for a new career as a counselor . His own vulnerability led him to forget his conventional maturity long enough to share his situation with that of every child who has to grow up in an uncontrollable world . Next , Lewiska . She died a year ago . So you may notice some extra sentiment in my comment . This 82-year-old black woman took my creative writing course several times because her own education had been shortchanged and she wanted to tell a story she knew was remarkable . She had grown up in New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandmother who had been a slave and a father who cooked in a hotel none of them could enter through the front door . But she never resented anyone or anything ; she did n't waste her time . After a first unhappy marriage , she moved to New York and did domestic work for rich women ( who kept telling her of their troubles ) so that she could afford to send her two girls to Catholic school  --  even though the first eight schools turned them down because they were black . She even learned from her second husband , a mean bootlegger by her account , because he knew a lot about human nature . When he had gone to prison , one night in a dream her dead mother handed her a dollar bill . She played 100 on the numbers and won herself a house in a suburban county . Three years ago her daughters took her back to a family reunion in New Orleans . They took great pride in marching in with her , elegantly dressed , through the front door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was . She did n't miss a thing about injustice or racism . She just used every bit of talent and vision she had so that personal and social injustice did not stop her from learning and passing on the joy of life . And finally , Joan . She was brought up in what psychologists would call a dysfunctional family  --  a mother who worried only about what people would say and how she looked , a father she hardly knew who had been hounded out of the house for indiscretions and died young after giving her a special pen the last time he saw her ( her mother took it away telling her it was too good for her ) , a puritanical Irish grandmother who hated to cook or clean but took in boarders , some of whom molested Joan though her mother and grandmother did n't notice . Joan loved flowers , dancing and her Italian neighbors ' clean homes , warm with the smell of sauces . But every time she tried to share some of her joy in these things with her mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her imagination was taken for craziness , even though at age 10 or 11 she often had to take care of the practical problems in that house . Now Joan 's imagination transforms the horror of that childhood into uproarious fiction , a comic revelation of our common lot . She has learned to love her crazy world and all its inhabitants without falsifying it , because she has grasped their shared vulnerability . Being a " vulnerable sharer " is a human identity we believers might see as our own if we want to be honest with ourselves and help others . We are besieged by metaphors urging us to partnership and cooperation , words that to some extent relate us to the problems we face : the need to be organic rather than mechanical , to be connected in a web of relationships rather than involved in domination and subordination . To see stardust in our hands with Brian Schwimme and Thomas Berry ( The Universe Story ) . But only as we come to know ourselves as vulnerable sharers in this web of creation do we carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivating us to do what we can to make things right  --  like Lewiska , like Joan . Only if we feel our connectedness , as well as know it , can we make decisions that are good for ourselves and those to whom we minister , or live or work with , in whatever capacity . Objectively , vulnerable sharers do not look any different from anyone else  --  just as Kierkegaard 's Man of Faith did not . Of course they do grow old . It 's part of the identity . Then they might look like the couple holding hands on the sofa in Tillie Olsen 's story " Hey Sailor , What Ship . " When their grown-up daughter sees them on a trip home , she lovingly calls them " peaceful wrecks . " Having taught so many older people , I can appreciate this description . It represents the difficult discipline of physical diminishment that can be accompanied by even greater sharing of mind and spirit . It is probably a more realistic description of the wisdom that the Eriksons posit as the virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievable contemporary form of sanctity for all of us . In any case , it seems to me no mean human or religious ambition to become vulnerable sharers , and , much later , peaceful wrecks .
