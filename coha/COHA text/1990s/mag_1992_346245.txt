ROSS PEROT BASES HIS CRUSADE for the presidency on being an outsider , a political ingenue who would n't know a Gucci-shoed lobbyist if he tripped over one . This reformer would have the public believe he has nothing in common with the fools in Washington . He supports a ban on " these guys with their alligator shoes , " who swarm over the halls of Congress trying to open loopholes large enough to drive their leased Jaguars through . <P> The problem is that Perot is one of these guys , albeit in wingtips with a military shine . He has backslapped and arm-twisted with the best of them , winning lucrative non-bid government contracts and appealing decisions he did n't like to higher , more malleable authorities , having loosened them up with huge gifts . Beneath Perot 's white shirts and CEO bluster beats the heart of an insider who has been playing the game for 25 years . <P> Although he talks as if he needs a visa to go inside the Beltway , Perot has dined at the White House , sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Cabinet and Capitol Hill . In 1975 , for example , he pulled off a coup most lobbyists only dream about . Late one night as the House Ways and Means Committee tied up the loose ends in that year 's tax bill , then Democratic Congressman Phil Landrum of Georgia introduced an amendment that might have been the largest one-time tax break in history , granting Perot an unheard-of capital-loss carry-back . Perot had contributed more than$27,000 to 12 members of the Ways and Means Committee . Ten of the recipients voted for the amendment , though it was later snuffed out in conference . <P> A partial explanation of Perot 's success is his equal-opportunity giving . In 1972 he forked over $200,000 to Richard Nixon 's re-election campaign . Meanwhile , two Perot executives channeled $100,000 to the presidential campaign of Arkansas Democrat Wilbur Mills , then chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . In 1974 , according to Common Cause , Perot gave $90,000 each to the Republicans and Democrats . Although Perot has shown little regard for George Bush , he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1979 and 1991 . <P> Perot has had access to Presidents since he first visited Lyndon Johnson at his Texas ranch . Perot was Ronald Reagan 's kind of guy . Reagan appointed him to the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board . Reagan thanked Perot for bankrolling three attempts to rescue American hostages in Lebanon . When he was Vice President , Bush arranged for Perot to have a private conversation with Reagan at Blair House to discuss American prisoners Perot believed were being held captive in Southeast Asia . Perot reported that the President had " personally asked me to stay on top of the issue . " But when Reagan cooled on Perot 's crusade , Perot reneged on an earlier promise of $2 million to the Reagan library . <P> Of all the Administrations Perot has embraced , he was closest to Richard Nixon 's . He was on the phone to the Nixon White House several times a week in 1970 and 1971 . Sometimes the subject was casual , such as imploring a White House staffer not to eat on the plane so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was serious , such as agreeing to the Administration 's request that he shore up Wall Street by taking over a nearly bankrupt brokerage.
