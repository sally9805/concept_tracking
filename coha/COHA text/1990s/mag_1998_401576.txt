Are We Ignoring the Early Warning Signs of Global Warming ? // Could bad weather be more than bad luck ? Were the droughts , disease outbreaks , wildfires and floods brought on by the great El Nino weather event of 199798 more than just the chance result of our variable global climate ? The severity of this last El Nino event has some clima tologists wondering if humancaused global warming might not be partly responsible for the severe weather . El Nino is a buildup of warm water in the eastern Pacific which recurs every three to eight years , producing a variety of severely disruptive weather patterns across the globe . Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research says he sees more than naturally occurring weather forces at work now , though . " EI Nino 's been behaving in a strange fashion over the last 20 years , " Trenberth says , " and this last El Nino event was massive-the sea surface temperature anomaly was bigger than we 'd ever seen before in previous El Ninos , nine degrees Fahrenheit above normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held there for two or three months . " Not only was 1997 the warmest year on record , and the first half of 1998 even warmer , but also nine of the 11 hottest years of the century fell within the last decade . The mounting evidence for global warming includes rising sea levels ( six inches in the past 100 years ) , widespread glacial melting and an ever-closer fit of observed trends with computergenerated climate models . One such model 's results , reported in 1996 in Nature , reveal that climatechange patterns resuiting from global warming closely resemble those associated with present-day El Nino events in the tropical Pacific . The researchers , Warren Washington and Gerald Meehl , conclude that because El Nino and global warming mimic each other , it 's extremely difficult to accurately pinpoint the causes of climate disturbance . Naturally caused or not , there is no denying the severe environmental toll of recent weather . Off California , Peru and Chile , warming of ocean waters disrupted the food chain by preventing nutrient-rich cold water from rising to the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea lions and other marine mammals . Higher sea surface temperatures caused by El Nino are also alleged to be killing off coral reefs around the world . ( Warm waters contributed to coral bleaching events in the Florida Keys in 1980,1983 , 1987 and 1990 . ) In Indonesia , rainforest fires torched more than 6,000 square miles , imperiling many rare species including plants , tropical migrant birds , leopards , tigers , elephants , rhinoceroses and orangutans . Fernando Gonzales , a World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) staffer who was stationed in Indonesia , observes , " People were lighting fires to clear land , thinking the rains would come soon , as they always had . " The economic damage caused by the Indonesian fires and smoke amounted to more than $4.4 billion , according to a joint study by WWF and the Economy and Environment Program for South East Asia ( EEPSEA ) . The Worldwatch Institute also reports that the 1997 fires in Asia alone released about as much carbon into the atmosphere as all of the factories , power plants and vehicles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Indonesian scenario repeated itself in Mexico and Central America , with more than a million acres of grasslands and forests burned . Smoke from the fires actually covered the entire sky over much of Texas , more than 1,000 miles away , for several weeks . Texas health authorities warned people to stay indoors and avoid heavy exertion while the smoglike haze lingered . The greatest concern for human health was the inhalation of tiny particles , many of them cancer-causing . Haze from the fires was reported as far away as Denver and Chicago . Last year in Brazil , the Amazon basin 's treasure trove of biodiversity was singed when an area the size of Great Britain went up in flames . Members of a Stone Age tribe , the Yanamamo , lost their homes to the raging inferno . El Nino 's damages , and global warming 's as well , are not limited to droughts and fire . Some places also receive more water , with devastating floods and ferocious storms . Trenberth says , " You do expect in a general sense , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more rainfall . Rainfall by its very nature tends to be spotty , so places where it rains , it rains harder , and places where it does n't rain , the droughts are apt to be worse . In the U.S. , there are pretty good measurements of rainfall going back to 1910 . There 's been an eight percent increase in rainfall in that period , but the key thing is that all of the increases have occurred at the high end-when it rains , it rains harder . This is what you 'd expect from global warming . " Floods attributed to El Nino made as many as half a million people homeless in Burma . In California , a barrage of mudslides and storms caused a state of emergency in 31 counties , with eight deaths and power blackouts in tens of thousands of homes . In Mexico last October , more than 400 died due to Hurricane Pauline . Ty  --  phoon Winnie , the most powerful in decades , killed 43 in China and Taiwan . Hurricane Linda in the eastern Pacific was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 220 miles per hour , with sustained winds of 200 miles per hour but , according to CNN , Linda exceeded Category 5 by such an extent that a new Category 6 was proposed by meteorologists . If climate experts are correct , then the latest El Nino effects may only be a taste of what s to come when global warming unleashes its full disruptive power . But this idea has its skeptics , including Marlowe Lewis , vice president for policy of the Washington , D.C.-based Competitive Enterprise Institute , a " pro-free-market think tank . " Lewis says he 's " very skeptical " that the recent large fires attributed to El Nino can be linked to global climate change . " Any time in the world there is going to be a drought somewhere , a flood somewhere , a deluge somewhere , " he says . " Climate science is still such primitive enterprise that there 's no way to correlate any particular drought or unusually wet weather cycle with any long-range trend in the climate . " Besides , says Lewis , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warming is anything to be terrified about . " The storms ahead may lend a renewed urgency to international efforts aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions , but if people continue to finger El Nino as the sole culprit , Mother Nature 's warning may not be heeded . <p>
