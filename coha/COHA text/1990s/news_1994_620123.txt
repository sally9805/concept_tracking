<p> Christopher Patten took over as Hong Kong 's governor two years ago , with the daunting task of preparing the crown colony for its return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 . He earned a reputation for his wit , his habit of hugging babies in public and his willingness to clash with Chinese leaders in Beijing over political change in Hong Kong . <p> Although a 1984 agreement between London and Beijing was supposed to guarantee that Hong Kong residents could maintain their lifestyle after 1997 , Patten argued repeatedly with Chinese leaders over the interpretation of that agreement . His attempt to institute political changes without Beijing 's seal of approval led to Chinese threats of abandoning the original agreement . <p> Patten recently visited San Francisco as part of a trip to promote trade relations between Hong Kong and cities on the U.S. West Coast and met with The Chronicle 's Editorial Board : <p> Q : You have earned a reputation as a fierce promoter of democratic reforms in Hong Kong . To what extent do you feel confident that the changes you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life after 1997 , and how concerned are you that your actions have angered the Chinese government and that there will be a backlash against them ? <p> A : The insurance policy that people in Hong Kong have is the joint declaration , the international treaty between Britain and China which seeks to guarantee Hong Kong 's way of life for 50 years beyond 1997 . I feel very strongly that unless we stand up for the values in the joint declaration before 1997 , unless we stand up for the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong was promised before 1997 , there 's much less chance of anybody standing up for those values or autonomy after 1997 . <p> How confident am I that civil society and the institutions of civil society will survive ? I think we 've given them the best possible chance of surviving . I think there is a momentum of commitment behind those institutions now , partly a consequence of ( the Tiananmen Square incident in ) 1989 , partly a consequence of a growing middle class in Hong Kong with rather moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to ask : ( What is ) the extent to which Chinese officials understand the rule of law and the extent to which they understand the relationship between an open economy and a free press ? <p> All you can finally say is that it 's hugely in China 's self-interest that it does all survive and work . The only figure that matters is that , with 6 million people , Hong Kong 's economy represents 21 percent of China 's gross domestic product . It 's an astonishing economic success story , and China must want that to go on . <p> Q : Did the arguments with the Chinese yield any positive results for democratization ? <p> A : When I went to Hong Kong , the question of exactly how the ' 94 and ' 95 elections should be run had n't been agreed upon . The argument really was n't about speeding up the democratization ; the argument was about whether we had a clean set of elections or whether we fixed them . One of China 's advisers in Hong Kong let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frank and amusing way about a year ago , when he said that it was not the Chinese way to rig elections , but they do like to know the result in advance . I think we would be carrying a huge burden of obloquy if we 'd agreed to arrangements which frankly fixed the elections in ' 94 and ' 95 . <p> The argument was n't just about democratization . I think it touches on the autonomy which Hong Kong was promised . And it touches on another issue : whether when dealing with China , other parties to a negotiation can ever have a bottom line . We did have a bottom line , and we stuck to it . We offered a lot of concessions , a lot of compromises , which were turned down . And I think that is for many Chinese officials our greatest sin in Hong Kong . <p> All that said , I hope that the argument is now behind us . <p> We 've just had the first round of elections , elections for our district boards , which have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had a record number of candidates . We had a record number of people involved in the campaign , including pro-Peking parties who enthusiastically took part , and we had a record turnout for local elections . It went , as you would expect in a community as sophisticated as Hong Kong , extremely smoothly . The idea that people in Hong Kong represent a threat when they decide who 's going to collect their dust bins is crazy . <p> Q : Britain did not begin aggressively pushing to institute democratic reforms in Hong Kong until you stepped in as governor , only five years before the transfer of sovereignty . Why was n't the initiative taken earlier ? <p> A : Everywhere else we had a formula to transfer the political values of a plural society to developing countries  --  bicameral legislature , democracy and independent courts and civil servants . We put it all on the launching pad and lit the blue- touch paper and hoped it would go into orbit . Sometimes it did . Sometimes , alas , it did n't . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never being prepared for independence . Hong Kong always had a rendezvous with 1997 . There were a couple of times in the ' 40s and ' 50s when my predecessors thought very seriously about doing in Hong Kong what was happening elsewhere . <p> But when it came to actually negotiating that transfer of sovereignty , we argued and the Chinese agreed that the process of democratization , beginning in the ' 80s and running right through 1997 and beyond , should be the underpinning of what the joint declaration said . <p> Q : When 1997 comes , you are expected to be repatriated along with other British civil servants . Assuming the Conservatives stay in power , could you become the next prime minister ? <p> A : First of all , I find it difficult to do more than one job at a time . I fetched up in politics by a curious route , involving a Republican campaign in New York for John Lindsay . <p> I was on a traveling scholarship from Oxford ( in 1965 ) . Was asked by a friend of Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsay for Mayor campaign . I was given the job of researching Bill Buckley , who was the conservative candidate . As a result of that , rather than joining the BBC to become a graduate trainee , I went into the Conservative Party 's research department . <p> Who knows what accidental steps the Almighty may have in mind now . I 'd certainly like to do another public service job , but whether back in mainstream politics , I do n't know . I want to write . It 's going to be a difficult job to follow , this one . Because it 's so extraordinarily interesting . Being " mayor " of Hong Kong , as it were , is itself fascinating . <p> Q : Our representative in the House , Nancy Pelosi , has been a leader among those who feel that linking economic sanctions to human rights behavior by the Chinese government is a good policy . You have lobbied for unconditional renewal of China 's most-favored-nation status . If China is to improve its human rights record , is n't international pressure necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned about human rights , but I think there is a general view that the best way of promoting human rights is by opening up the economy and by promoting economic growth . You do n't have to be a Marxist to believe this : The liberalization of the economy has political consequences . It would be bad for China and bad for Hong Kong and bad for human rights in both if trade between our two biggest trading partners , China and the United States , was disrupted . <p> I think that there is quite a lot of nonsense written and spoken about the so-called " Asian way . " We 're not talking about Confucianism ; we 're usually talking about governments that do n't like being criticized and want to stay in office . While recognizing that Asian cultures , Asian civilizations are different , I do n't think that we should abandon our own value system to do better business with Asia . Nor do I think we should assume that people in Asia do n't feel just as strongly about free speech or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the same in Bombay or Bangkok or Singapore as it would in Birmingham or San Francisco .
