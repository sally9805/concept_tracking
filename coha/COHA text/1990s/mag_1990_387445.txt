Section : A kinder , gentler Gulf strategy . <p> During World War II , Vice President ( and future TNR editor ) Henry Wallace used to imagine the day when world peace would be kept by a United Nations equipped with its own air force . Until recently this seemed like a classic manifestation of woolly-minded one-worldism . But the remarkably global opposition to Saddam Hussein seems to have lent one-worldism new respectability . Lately Washington men-in-suits have been talking soberly about the prospect of U.N.-sanctioned military action in the Middle East . Can F-111s with U.N . ' stencilled on them be far behind ? <p> Probably so  --  at least as far as the actual stencils go . But it 's increasingly clear that if President Bush chooses the military route in the Persian Gulf , the soundest strategy would be punitive bombing conducted with U.N . sanction . Along every basic dimension  --  political , geopolitical , even moral  --  air strikes against military targets ( surgical strikes , as they say ) are preferable to an all-out air-and-ground war . <p> Yet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , you will be briskly reminded that they would probably fail to get Iraqi troops out of Kuwait . And that 's true . But why is it so important to get Iraqi troops out of Kuwait ? Leaving aside for the moment the awkward political fact that President Bush has vowed to get them out , what exactly is the larger rationale ? <p> Few people seem eager to touch this question . Even as Senator Sam Nunn led the mid-November Democratic backlash against Bush 's Gulf policy , he stressed his commitment to liberating Kuwait ; he just wanted to give sanctions more time to work . And the defense analyst Edward Luttwak , the premier advocate of air strikes as a neat and clean alternative to ground war , feels compelled to argue halfheartedly that bombing could eventually starve out and force the retreat of the occupying Iraqi forces '  --  which does n't sound too neat and clean . <p> To the extent that America 's geopolitical aims in the Persian Gulf can be gleaned from administration pronouncements , they are basically twofold : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly , its nuclear arms program ) and thereby prevent Hussein , or his successor , from acquiring a stranglehold on world oil supplies through further expansion or intimidation ; and ( 2 ) set a precedent that will preserve peace in the post-cold-war era . <p> These are indeed worthy , even vital , goals  --  for America and for the world . But they could be reached at a much lower human cost with a few days of air strikes that did n't liberate Kuwait than with a few months of war that did . In fact , forget about the cost . Surgical strikes are the only strategy that stands a really good chance of achieving both of these geopolitical goals , period . Though either military option could reach the first goal ( emasculating Iraq ) , the second ( setting a precedent ) is a more delicate matter . <p> There 's been lots of talk about precedent setting , but hardly anyone has mentioned one essential element in any punitive precedent : the punishment must be credibly repeatable . Even if a ground war retakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve to discourage future aggressors only if the political costs are low . If they 're not  --  if over months of fighting , as soldiers stream home in body bags , the will of the anti-Iraq alliance weakens , and support among American politicians dissolves into hand-wringing and recrimination  --  then this whole exercise will add up only to a sterling example of something the world is not willing to do again . <p> Now consider the bombing option . If allied air power , at minimal cost , severely impairs Iraq 's military machine , including its budding nuclear capability , its ballistic missiles , and its chemical weapons ( and including Hussein himself , if possible ) , then the Saddam Hussein school of geopolitics will fall into disrepute among ambitious young autocrats . This lesson will carry special force if the impairment is made lasting through a continuing embargo on arms and high technology , coupled with the continued presence of multinational forces ( not necessarily American ) in Saudi Arabia . And bear in mind that these sorts of ongoing international checks against Iraqi expansion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the wake of a war , which could well fragment the global anti-Iraq alliance . <p> The bombing option has its problems . Since the 1981 Israeli air strike , Iraq has dispersed and fortified its nuclear research facilities . But this obstacle is at least partly surmountable and , in any event , looms equally large in the generic all-out-war scenario , which confines the ground invasion to Kuwait , leaving bombing as the only way to hit targets inside Iraq . <p> Two other obvious problems with the bombing option  --  some hostages will get killed and some Iraqi civilians will get killed  --  also afflict the standard all-out-war scenario equally ( if not more so ) , and therefore ca n't be used by war enthusiasts to dismiss the bombing scenario . Still , these are serious issues , and if they 're serious enough they should be used to dismiss both military options . So let 's look at them . <p> Dropping American bombs on Iraqi civilians , even aside from moral considerations , is a potentially large public relations problem . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly on military targets distant from large population centers . And we can afford to be this selective . The goal is not the utter annihilation of Iraq 's military , a feat that , as has been noted , would only revive the specter of Iranian hegemony . The goal is to so diminish Iraq 's military that , in the context of ongoing arms sanctions and a fairly modest Gulf security structure , Iraq would remain unthreatening for a long , long time . <p> As for the hostages : the death of scores or hundreds of civilians is , obviously , a horrible thing . What is n't clear to me is why it 's so much more horrible than the death of scores or hundreds ( to say nothing of thousands ) of soldiers . The American soldiers in the Gulf are men ( and women ) who signed up for service vaguely aware of the attendant dangers but in most cases never dreaming they 'd wind up facing a real live enemy . Certainly the TV recruiting pitch  --  get a free education , wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't play up the dangers . The hostages are for the most part men who went to the Middle East vaguely aware that it 's a dicey part of the world , but eager to make money . In short : hostages and soldiers alike took what looked like marginal risks for career reasons . In both cases they miscalculated . <p> Certainly there 's a relevant distinction here , given the consent explicit in the act of enlistment . I just do n't see a distinction that justifies a five-to-one or fifty-to-one ratio of soldiers to civilians in the moral calculus , as is commonly assumed in discourse on these matters . Of course , if you are among those who believe that not a single American life should be spent in the Persian Gulf , then these ratios do n't matter . But if you 're one of the many people who barely even blink when hundreds of soldiers perish but get queasy at the thought that a dozen innocent ' hostages might die for the greater good , then maybe your priorities are due for reweighing . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as they 're in uniform is one of the several great philosophical myths whose main function is to sustain the institution of war . Another is that enemy corpses carry zero weight  --  as if you or I could n't just as easily have been born in the shoes of some hapless Iraqi soldier . ) <p> The most glaring deficiency of the bombing option  --  its likely failure to liberate Kuwait  --  is , again , not a geopolitical problem . World oil production , with no contribution from Iraq or Kuwait , has already reached its pre-invasion level ; and , as we 've seen , the routinely cited geopolitical virtues of evicting the Iraqis can be realized through air strikes . Nonetheless , there is a strictly political problem here , given President Bush 's famous vow that Iraqi aggression will not stand . ' There is also a deeper issue : Is n't it cynically amoral to forsake the Kuwaiti people , who , after all , are the primary victims here ? Let 's take the issues in reverse order . <p> If you buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costly future aggression that would otherwise take place , whereas a ground war , with its horrific cost and gloomy aftermath , would fail at deterrence  --  then you agree that someone has to sacrifice : either Kuwaitis endure brutality and hardship to save the lives of people elsewhere on the planet at some point in the future , or those future lives get sacrificed for the Kuwaitis . Moreover , even if you do n't buy my assertion , you still face a trade-off of suffering : either hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis lose their homes and/or their freedom ( and in a few cases their lives ) , or thousands , quite possibly tens of thousands , of soldiers lose their lives liberating Kuwait ( a process , by the way , that would leave more than a few Kuwaitis dead , not to mention a great many of Iraqis ) . Either way , somebody suffers . The object of the game is to minimize long-term human suffering . You can call this way of looking at the problem icily utilitarian  --  which it is  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for the political problem of forsaking Kuwait : it is clear in retrospect that President Bush might have chosen a more flexible line than this will not stand ' ( e.g. , Saddam Hussein will rue the day . ' ' ) . But the details of this pledge do n't stick in the minds of Americans nearly the way No new taxes ' did ( a fact that is n't , I grant you , a tribute to Americans ) . What Americans want in the Persian Gulf is to vent their indignation toward Hussein  --  to feel that he 's gotten his due and that we 've stood up to him . And you 'd be surprised how much indignation could be vented via nightly footage of his military behemoth being crushed , especially if he got pinned beneath the rubble . <p> All Bush would need to do is provide stirring narration . And that should n't be hard . Protecting the world against future aggression by Hussein , and against aggression by future Husseins , is a morally sound and perfectly salable goal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't serve it . In fact , most Americans are eager to understand that ; the adrenaline of early August has long since subsided , and what support for a war Americans are still mouthing would begin to fade once the death toll reached four figures . Bush might then learn the lesson the deficit crisis should have taught him : when you make a stupid promise , it 's often best to eat your words early , before they 've done their damage . <p> Of course , the ideal outcome in the Persian Gulf would be none of the above . It would get Iraq out of Kuwait , enduringly neutralize Iraq 's military , deter future aggressors , and not entail any more death . In other words : a negotiated withdrawal that left Hussein with no real rewards for his adventurism and brought sturdy institutional checks against further adventurism , including not only a Gulf security structure and arms sanctions but also international inspection of Iraq 's arsenal for chemical and nuclear weapons . Sounds pretty unlikely , but who knows ? This crisis has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a reasonable prospect of a truly satisfactory peaceful outcome , and so long as the passage of time is n't eroding our other options , we should stick with the sanctions . <p> But should President Bush give up on diplomacy and opt for a military solution , he would be well advised to take the one military course that stands a decent chance of preserving broad global support . He should seek Security Council backing for air strikes of well-defined purpose and duration , conditional on Iraq 's failure to withdraw from Kuwait by a specified date . The first round of strikes  --  aimed at nuclear and chemical weapons facilities , ballistic missile sites , and key military bases  --  need n't preclude a second or third round , a fact that may put Hussein or his successor in the mood to negotiate during intermission . ( He would probably surrender all remaining hostages  --  and maybe something more  --  in exchange for a no-more-bombs pledge . ) But at some point , when the desired damage is done and the Iraqi leadership has hunkered down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All vital goals will have been reached . It will be time to call it a day . <p> Underlying this whole analysis , of course , is the assumption that a ground war would be long and messy . This is probably a good bet . Certainly several in-the-know people , including Secretary of State James Baker and Desert Shield Commander H. Norman Schwarzkopf , have been suggesting as much . ( Schwarzkopf , by the way , also insists that the Iraqi ballistic missile capability  --  a source of concern immediately before any imminent surgical strike  --  has been grossly oversold and poses no unmanageable threat to Saudi Arabia . ) <p> But even assuming Baker and Schwarzkopf are wrong , and an all-out war would be fairly short and clean ( only , say , 5,000 American deaths ) , keep in mind the uniqueness of the circumstances that have produced both this huge commitment of American force and the global support for it  --  namely , an enemy of storybook proportions : a sadistic and megalomaniacal tyrant , a man who has committed genocide against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise helicopter crash , and who stands menacingly astride the world 's oil supply . Do n't expect the next threat to world order , however ultimately dangerous it is , to come in such immediately despicable form . So do n't expect that , even if an all-out war goes smoothly , tomorrow 's aspiring aggressors will have reason to worry much about any undertaking so costly as a multinational invasion . <p> But do expect them to worry about simple , relatively cheap surgical strikes , if a precedent exists . As any criminologist will tell you , a painful and probable punishment is a stronger deterrent than a devastating but unlikely one . <p> Henry Wallace 's instincts were right . Air power is the only instrument of military force that is both potent enough and politically cheap enough to be used dependably as an international weapon against aggression . And , under present circumstances , it is the only such instrument that is precise enough to be used conscionably . <p> By Robert Wright <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
