Is the hip-hop generation all about violence and degradation ? are we collectively doomed to go the way of Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls ? I hope not , because I 'm a member of that generation . In the weeks to come , as we try to make sense of the death of two of the youngest , richest , best-known black men in America , we 'll probably succumb to a natural temptation to divide the " good kids " from the " hip-hop kids . " I 'm not buying it . I grew up listening to hip-hop . In elementary school I tuned my radio to the techno-influenced chant Planet Rock and innocent party jams like Rapper 's Delight . By high school and college , hip-hop was everything from the pop female braggadocio of Salt-n-Pepa to the black nationalism of Public Enemy . Today , in addition to music that ranges from alternative rock to techno , I listen to rough-edged rappers the Wu Tang Clan  --  and , yes , Biggie and Tupac as well . <P> Mindful of our public image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather see us repudiate rap than redefine it . But groups from the Fugees to the Roots to A Tribe Called Quest continue to blend phat beats , dope rhymes and intelligent ideas into high-powered rap , regardless of marketing data that say gangsta rap sells best . Who 's pushing the rawest rhymes to No. 1 on the charts ? For years now , the largest volume of hip-hop albums has been sold to white suburban kids who 've deposed heavy metal and elevated hip-hop to the crown of Music Most Likely to Infuriate My Parents . The suburban rebellion  --  its record-buying tastes , its voyeurism of what too often it views as " authentic black culture "  --  has contributed to the primacy of the gangsta-rap genre . <P> The music may be in white America 's homes , but the violence is in black America 's neighborhoods . That 's why we , the hip-hop generation , bear the ultimate responsibility for reshaping the art form we love . Hip-hop used to lift us above the struggles we faced ; then it tried to inform us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the struggles we face . I used to tell myself that the " thug life " portrayed in the music was just fiction . Now it 's incontrovertible fact . We can do better than this . If we do n't , we 're little more than voyeurs of our own demise . <P> CNN commentator Farai Chideya is also online at
