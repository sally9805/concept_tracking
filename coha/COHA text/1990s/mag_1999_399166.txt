Technology The telecom industry is going optical , replacing chip-based gear with new systems that deal only in bits of light . It will mean building great new fortunes  --  and destroying old ones . <p> MAYBE YOU HAVE HEARD about the public offering of Sycamore Networks Inc. a few weeks ago  --  the unknown firm with $11 million in sales now worth $18 billion . More wild ones are emerging . Rumor has it that Optical Networks , an outfit in a similar line of business but with no customers and no sales , is wrapping up a round of venture funding that will value it at $750 million . <p> Sycamore and Optical are just an early rumbling in the tectonic shift that has begun shaking the telecommunications industry : the move to optical networking , the hottest new market in high tech . <p> Just as the PC usurped the mainframe and set off explosive change in computers , new optical technologies may someday overtake electronics and topple the established telecom order . Vast fortunes will go up for grabs . No less than AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdoms . Optical newborns may rise up to become the next Dell or Microsoft . <p> The competition is accelerating . Lucent has spent $20 billion to acquire Ascend and Nexabit . Cisco just agreed to pay $7.4 billion for Cerent and Monterey Networks , despite underwhelming sales . Ciena paid almost $1 billion for two optical acquisitions . JDSUniphase , an optical-parts maker , just agreed to pay $2.8 billion to acquire an outfit named Optical Coating . <p> It 's a bit much for some . " Cisco 's acquisitions might make sense in a microcosm , but they 've reset " prices in the industry , says Ciena Chief Executive Patrick Nettles , whose own stock is up over 200% this year . Sycamore is " caught in a trap of their own success . " <p> Fueling this frenzy are a building boom in fiber-optic lines and soaring demand for bandwidth . Telephone companies have used fiber for two decades , but the network boxes that reroute and switch the signals have always been based on silicon chips and copper circuitry . Silicon speaks the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Translating from one to the other gobbles up time and energy . <p> Replace all of it with new optical machines that work in the realm of photons  --  no translation required  --  and fiber-optics capacity will expand even more . And so will the fortunes of those who get in early and build the right light-bending products . <p> All this change is hurtling forward at an uncharacteristically hurried pace . For decades the makers of telecom equipment put reliability above innovation , introducing new-generation products only once every few years . Now they are forced to live on Internet time like everyone else . <p> " It 's a huge shock to the guys in white smocks , " says Frank Dzubeck , president of Communications Network Architects , a consulting firm . When Sycamore touted an ability to turn out new optical products so fast they would be available for just-in-time delivery , " I had telecom company people telling me it could n't be done . " <p> Some 3,500 U.S. firms are now beavering away at optical technologies to channel the ever-rising tide of digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are devising ways to send optical signals vast distances without the need for expensive electronic goosing ; tinkering with mirrors to switch and bend light in new ways ; and trimming costs to open up entirely new parts of the telecom infrastructure . <p> Fiber-optic backbones now serve mainly as cross-country thruways because it was too expensive to deploy all the computers needed to serve small local markets ; the shift to optics could let fiber networks extend farther into neighborhoods than ever before . <p> For consumers the promise of fat , fully optical pipes will one day render video calls as mundane as voice calls . Net shoppers will buy a sofa while flipping around a crystal-clear 3-D image of their model on-screen and speaking with a salesman by PC . <p> Businesses ca n't wait . Banks will pay serious bucks to the first guy who can trim , to milliseconds from a few seconds , the time it takes to zap money around the globe or approve a Visa transaction . Time is money . <p> " A currency trader who spotted a big deal could calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else knew what was going on , " says Lewis Wilks , who oversees Internet applications at Qwest , a major fiber-network builder . " People who get optical technology and leverage it are going to take market share from those who do n't . " <p> Venture firms and Wall Street have been quick to get it , jumping on the optical-bandwidth wagon with a passion usually reserved for dot.coms ( see right ) . Employee raids are heating up , too . Nortel this month slammed Optical Networks , in which Cisco holds a stake , with a suit alleging that in luring away 19 engineers ( FORBES , Nov. 15 ) , the new firm seeks to steal its secrets . <p> This buying panic of the 1990s has its source in the 1970s . By 1980 carriers used fiber to carry data and voice calls as optical signals in the form of photons . On and off blips of light were used to represent the 1s and 0s of binary computer code . <p> In the mid-1990s Ciena , Lucent and Nortel introduced boxes that vastly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions split the signal into eight wavelengths of different colors of light . Since then such " wave division multiplexers " have steadily increased the number of wavelengths per fiber and the capacity carried on each . <p> Current " muxes " typically can push up to 100 light waves down a single fiber , but by year-end Nortel will begin shipping test gear that pushes 160 lightwaves , each carrying 10 billion bits of data per second . That 's 1.6 trillion bits per second , or enough capacity to let 28 million people all surf the Web at current modem speeds  --  on a single glass strand no thicker than a human hair . <p> Such techniques have pushed the cost of carrying traffic on fiber to about 1% of what it would cost on all-electronic equipment , and it will keep falling . Look for capacities to grow fourfold in the next few years . Yet bottlenecks persist . Callers suffer " all circuits are busy " messages and on-liners know all about the World Wide Wait . <p> Do n't blame fiber . AT &T'S; entire network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground and could expand merely by firing up more of them . Long-distance bandwidth will outrun demand for years to come  --  even with traffic expected to rise 2,000% by 2002 . <p> The problem lies in the gear linked to all that glass . Photons are devilish to work with . Your phone and PC still churn out electrons , which must be whipped along copper cables . Converting them into photons requires costly computers , or switches , that modulate lasers so that light can carry the signal . <p> Photons are wonderfully efficient at hauling data long distances , but their signals can not be manipulated like electronic signals . That means it is still impossible to send a packet of calls as photons from New York to Chicago , route some locally and send the rest on to Los Angeles  --  without first converting the signal into electrons . Such **26;2002;TOOLONG conversions are expensive , which is why optical transmission has made economic sense only for long-haul carriers . <p> Until now . The price of laser devices used to generate optical signals at 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three years . Lucent , Nortel and Ciena have debuted " metro " products that will bring optical networking to local markets . Cable &; Wireless ' U.S. unit is stringing 20 cities with Ciena 's fiber boxes and aims to add 40 more next year . <p> Lucent has launched 14 optical products for local markets . It is pushing businesses to string fiber directly into their offices . Only 5% have it today . Lucent even expects to sell a $100 optical card within a year that enables PCs to hook directly into fiber networks . <p> To be sure , pure , all-optical networks are a long way off . All-optical routers that can manipulate packets of light , pulling some signals off a fiber and sending the rest on their way , may not be widely available for years . <p> But getting there may go faster than even the experts expect . This month Lucent is taking the wraps off what it insists will be a fully optical router , though it wo n't be ready until next July . A huge payoff is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the investors who bet on the winners .
