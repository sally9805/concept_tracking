This story marks James Sarafin 's debut in F &SF,; although he has previously published three stories in Asimov 's SF and a few tales in Alfred Hitchcock Mystery Magazine , including one piece that won the Robert L. Fish Memorial Award . He lives in Anchorage , Alaska , and clearly knows whereof he speaks with regard to the chilly setting for this tale . <p> THE NIGHT 'S RAIN HAD washed the glacier clean , making its face shine a pale but scintillating blue , except where seams of silty gravel ran through it like rock riddling a piece of quartz . Two-hundredfoot cliffs of ice enclosed three sides of a meltwater lake accumulated at one end of a huge bowl in the glacier 's surface . In the other direction , southcentral Alaska 's Chugach Mountains filled the horizon like the rim of an even huger bowl . Carl Saville stood on the glacier 's sun- and rainroughened surface and waited for the children to finish playing on the ice . Their shrill voices echoed off the lake like inhuman laughter . In rare moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jagged pinnacles of ice above . Carl first knew the surge was coming from the little ripples forming around the edge of the lake . His heart pounded in his ears and he tensed his legs to jump as he felt the trembling grow in the ice underfoot . Time enough to shout one quick warning .... " Look out ! " The echo came back out of the bowl just as the ice groaned , cracked , and heaved . Carl scrambled to keep his feet , his bare hands churning into the hard granular surface . His eyes darted , scanning cracks that might widen into a deep crevasse , like the one that had almost killed him years before . The surge stopped even quicker than it started . The teacher and fifteen fourth-graders were mostly on all fours , screaming . As Carl stood upright the little girl nearest him burst into tears . His own hands stung from contact with the sharp , cold ice . The kids milled around him as Carl struggled to keep his own fear from showing . He 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangerous place , he would lose a lot of business . " Remember how I said the glacier flows like a slow , slow river ? " He waited for a few of them to nod before going on . " Sometimes the ice gets caught on the ground , then suddenly comes free , jumps ahead . But it does n't happen often , and it 's over now . " " Is n't it time to go back to the bus ? " the teacher said . Carl 's walking tour had brought them a mile out on the glacier , and he started them up a long ravine that was the quickest route out of the bowl . He let the teacher lead them on while he waited for stragglers . The last boy turned to study him . He seemed a bit taller than the others , with light brown hair , cut short but unevenly , and bright blue eyes . Carl recalled that this boy had listened attentively to his glaciology lectures , and realized he was going to ask a question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl seemed to shimmer , like a wave of cold coming off the wall of ice behind him ; he felt light in the head and queasy in his stomach . He had n't known this was Eric 's class , had n't even recognized him . Carl could only nod . Then he noticed the boy 's shoe was untied and went down on one knee . Just as he finished tying Eric 's shoelaces , Carl saw another pair of eyes looking up out of a clear seam of ice below him . He straightened his back and blinked . The eyes had looked bluer than the glacier ice , which had been crushed dense enough to absorb every other color of the spectrum . They had looked as blue as his own . He could feel the sun 's heat on his face and the chill breeze coming off the glacier against his sweat-dampened back . A reflection , he decided , rubbing hard bits of accumulated dust from the corner of his eyes . " What 's the matter , Grandpa ? " Eric asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little stiff when you 're my age . " Carl knew his grandson saw him as old , with hair and beard mostly gone to gray , face and hands tanned a leathery brown , and eyes creased into a perpetual squint from years spent on the bright , reflective ice . The boy ran ahead to join his friends , and Carl dropped again to one knee . A thin rivulet of meltwater ran down the ravine and over the clear seam of ice , which was about four feet long , a window into the glacier . Carl used his left hand and forearm to dam the rivulet for a better look . The chill water coursed over his fingers and the slick , deeper cold of the ice made his arm ache at the old break . The eyes stared back out of an upraised , bearded face . Could n't be a reflection , not a foot below the surface . There was a man down there , trapped , frozen in the ice . " Mr. Saville ? " The teacher called from up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last look into the ice and was up and moving , legs swinging into his hiking stride , up and stepping long over each meltwater pool , to the top of the ravine . He led the class onto a stretch of " black ice , " where the glacier was thickly covered with silt and gravel , rolling in gentle hills almost to the parking lot . At one place they had to cross a meltwater stream running high and fast under the long June sun . Carl stopped in midstream to help the children , lifting each in turn across . When Eric 's turn came , Carl tried to speak but could find no words ; then the boy was gone , running to join his classmates . As he splashed out of the stream , Carl 's hands tingled with warmth from holding Eric under the arms . Carl watched his grandson , kicking up dust with the other boys , and wondered what he was like , really . What was his favorite sport , did he collect baseball cards ? What did his face look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticing girls yet ? He 'd have to talk to the boy to find out anything . But what could you say to a grandson you did n't even recognize ? It was easier to wonder about the frozen man . The only way a man could get in the ice like that was if he 'd fallen into a crevasse , then was covered by water that froze with almost perfect clarity . Carl knew of no one who had disappeared in this vicinity . Unless someone had killed him and hidden the body there . Or maybe the man had fallen in when this section of ice had been higher up the valley , thousands of years ago , and been carried along in the glacier 's inexorable flow . He recalled news reports of a Neolithic traveler who had been found well-preserved in a glacier , high in the Alps . This must be the same thing ; Tanaina and other Indians had once inhabited this area . He should probably call the Anchorage newspaper - the publicity would be good for business . Vegetation appeared before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually sprouting in the gravelly soil on top of the ice . They dropped down and went up a dusty trail , through a grove of stunted willows , to the gravel parking lot Carl 's bulldozer had carved on the terminal moraine years before . Most of the children went to the school bus , but Carl noticed Eric heading toward a brown Jeep Wagoneer with rust-rotted fenders and knew he 'd missed his chance . Carl 's own son , Dan , got out of the Wagoneer to talk briefly to the teacher . Then , without acknowledging his father 's presence , Dan drove off with Eric . Carl waited until the dust had settled from the Wagoneer and bus , then drove his ATV back to the small gift shop and museum in front of the log house where he had lived for many years . The gift shop had a sliding window abutting the road so his single employee could collect the admission fee . Carl did n't own the glacier , but he did own the only road to it . Anyone could look from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they wanted to " WALK ON THE GLACIER , " as his highway sign advertised , they had to pay Carl - or those trespassers next door . Carl stopped the ATV by the window and asked , " Did you collect from the guy in the brown Wagoneer ? " Raymond , a summer college hire who knew few of the locals , replied , " Yeah , sure . " Eric was already in fourth grade , and Carl had been cheated out of any part of the boy 's life except for a few brief glimpses through the windows of cars passing on the road . Dan had chosen to live among the trespassers and help them steal his own father 's livelihood . Carl and his wife Rebecca had homesteaded in this valley back in " 65 , after they noticed all the tourists stopping to photograph the glacier . He bulldozed a gravel road downslope from the highway , and by the following summer the Savilles had a log cabin built and their first sign out on the highway . Then Bill Davison came and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a section line , which had a public easement reserved by law . He got , which also fronted the glacier . And Davison put out his own sign , with a large painting of the blue ice done by his daughter , Clara . " God put the glacier there , " Davison had told him , in their only faceto-face argument . " We 've got as much right to homestead and run a business as you . " So Carl lost half of the business he had developed . Tourists only came in the summer , and two families struggled where one would have thrived . For more than a decade , no Davison or Saville said a word to the other . Or so Carl and Rebecca believed , until their son announced that he was marrying Clara . Carl had n't spoken to Dan since then , not even at Rebecca 's funeral , after the cancer had eaten away her pancreas . Dan had made his choice , to abandon his own family and live with his wife and child on a five-acre parcel split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see what kind of people they were when Clara finally left him and Eric for a motorcyclist from L.A. But Dan continued to help manage the Davisons " resort - as if Davison were his father ! Davison there with the son and grandson both . Now Carl saw the way to show them something , the trespasser and the disloyal son . The man in the ice-what a find ! He could put out a new sign : " SEE THE ICEMAN - 10,000 YEARS OLD ! " The tourists would line up to get in . Carl grabbed Raymond to help rearrange the museum exhibits . He could put the iceman in his old eight-foot freezer , replacing the lid with a plexiglass skylight . It would be perfect right beside a display case of Tanaina artifacts  --  stone figurines , antler tools , fur clothing , woven willow baskets  --  which he had acquired in trade over the years . On a posterboard in the back of the case his late wife 's handwriting explained why the Tanaina had avoided the glacier . Legend told of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . The glacier shook in anger , to warn him , but the hunter continued on . He came upon a sheer cliff of ice and was looking for a way up when he found the body of a man who had been killed in a fall . But something was strange- the dead man 's clothing and weapons looked just like the hunter 's . And when he turned the body over , the face was his own ! The hunter fled in terror , back to his village , where his family and friends greeted him with great joy . They said he had been gone a long time , they feared he was dead . When he told his tale , all knew he had traveled into the spirit world . Carl did n't tell Raymond anything . It might not be legal to display a human body , but if no one knew where it came from the state troopers would probably believe the exhibit was just a tourist rip-off , at least for a season or two . Maybe just long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway , then east to a roadside lodge . From the parking lot there the glacier could be seen snaking back thirty miles from his resort , branching into the high peaks which amassed yearround snow from clouds roiling in from the Gulf of Alaska . He knew the geology , from all the years of handling tourists " questions and guiding visiting glaciologists ; but still , when he saw the glacier like this , in its entirety , it seemed not to belong in the forested valley , as if it were an intrusion from somewhere else . Seeing it now in the sun , its walls and spires glowing in the green and brown valley , reminded Carl of a picture of a fairy city in a book Rebecca used to read to Dan , of how Carl would come home late from work to find Rebecca reading softly to their son . He went into the lodge and hired the bar waitress , a part-time artist , to paint the new sign . Back home , he 'd barely settled into his chair for the evening when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few locals who would talk to him ; most resented having to pay , just like the tourists , to use his road to hunt or reach their mining claims . But Ken understood business , and Carl purchased from Ken 's general store . " So what 's going on back there , Carl ? " Word traveled fast in the valley . " I heard you 're putting up a sign with a picture of a caveman in a block of ice . " " Setting up a new exhibit , " Carl told him . " The Iceman . Thousands of years old , at least . " " Oh , come on . It 's not real , is it ? " " Why do n't you come find out . Should be ready by Friday . " Ken laughed . " You offering discount tickets ? " " Sure , the same discount you give me . " On Thursday , with the freezer ready in the museum , Carl locked up for the evening , loaded some tools on a trailer hooked to his ATV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached the ravine he noticed the water level in the lake had dropped ; the recent shift in the ice must have enlarged the subsurface drainage . With more water now seeping below to make the ground slick , the glacier could well surge again soon . It took only a minute to locate the dark shape of the man frozen in the ice . Carl began digging with a pick , using a shovel to clear the broken ice out of the hole . He had decided to dig a circular trench around the upright body to avoid damaging it . The resulting ice cylinder could be raised with a hand winch attached to a pole tripod , which he had previously used for lifting moose quarters and car engines . Carl had worked hard with his body all his life and kept at it steadily until the early morning dawn . The air had become cold , and he zipped his jacket tight around his neck , blew on his hands , and continued . As he chopped and dug Carl could see , in the increasing light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder taking shape in the center of the trench . But he could n't distinguish any features of the man 's body or clothing because the pick had gouged and scratched the ice . When the trench reached a depth of six feet , Carl stopped to erect the tripod , fastening the winch cable to three ice screws set into the cylinder . He resumed digging at an angle , below the frozen man 's feet , until he could break the cylinder free of the underlying ice . Then he jacked the cylinder up , backed the trailer over the edge of the hole , and tried to lower the cylinder onto the trailer . It only slid back into the hole . He tried to back the trailer further , but the ATV tires skidded against the weight of the cylinder . He finally had to give up . The jagged pinnacles of ice beyond the lake cast deep shadows over the bowl , but he could see the first leak of sunlight striking the top of the ridge above the ravine . He climbed the ridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat looking down the valley while the sun warmed his back . So what was he going to do now ? There was no way to load the heavy ice cylinder by himself . He 'd have to bring Raymond out here after all , just take the risk of whether he 'd keep his mouth shut . He should be showing up at the resort , unlocking the gates pretty soon now . Automatically , Carl checked his bearings by looking toward home-then he rose and looked hard . Instead of the familiar resort he had built and added to over the years , there stood a much larger , modem hotel , several stories high , with uniform windows and balconies facing the glacier , all the glass reflecting the morning 's golden sunlight . Through the glare he made out a tour bus near the front door . And the road and parking lot were not dark simply from the morning shadows - they appeared to be paved with asphalt ! Some kind of mirage . Different densities of air over the glacier , reflecting the image or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that anywhere nearby . He must be so tired he was hallucinating . He stumbled down into the ravine and started the ATV toward home . When he topped a rise he was relieved to see the mirage was gone , that he was heading toward his own familiar resort . Carl went to bed dead-tired and as he slept he had a dream about something that really happened to him long ago , one late September day . He is walking out on the glacier , using the elevation to scout for moose in the valley , walking on and on . By noon the morning 's sun disappears behind dark clouds and snow starts to fall , big , heavy wet flakes that obscure the valley below . He comes to a slight depression running in a long line across the surface . The ice in the depression looks clearer , more granular than elsewhere . As he crosses the depression , the glacier surges on him for the first time , He feels the quivering underfoot , hears the booming cracks all around , then hears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl sees cracks forming on both sides of the depression , and as he lifts a foot the surface gives way - he drops into a hidden crevasse . Nothing in his life has ever shocked him so much as this fall into a vertical crack barely wider than his body . His toes and fingernails scrabble futilely on the slick wet ice . He finally smashes to a stop some thirty feet down , where the crack narrows , his rifle slipping from his shoulder and clattering out of sight into the depths of the crevasse . Carl feels only cold and pain , from the bone protruding out of his left forearm and in his chest where he 's wedged tight in the crevasse . The close , cold walls of ice still seep water from the morning 's sun , sucking out his body heat . Heavy snowflakes sifting down the crevasse obscure even the sky above . Somehow he lifts a leg and right arm , finds purchase to move up , removing the tightness just enough to breathe . He rests a while , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Everything is white and featureless , without depth around him ; he only knows up from the direction of waterflow . Bracing his broken arm against his chest , Carl works his way up an inch at a time with his feet , knees , and good arm . A dozen times he almost quits , relaxes , drifts off into the white nothingness . Here the dream diverges from Carl 's reality . In real life he had somehow found a last bit of will to inch on a bit more , crawled out on the surface just above , and staggered home . But Carl 's greatest , secret fear was how close that last bit of will had been to not coming . In the dream it does n't come , and he hangs wedged in the crack , staring up , big wet snowflakes covering his staring eyes .... He was awakened by laughter and voices coming faintly through the museum door . A group of tourists stood around the empty freezer , Ken Janssen among them . Ken had apparently been making jibes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Carl . " Do n't look now , but your iceman thawed and walked out on you ! " The tourists laughed . Carl had forgotten - he 'd asked Raymond to pick up the new sign and put it out on the highway this morning . He tried to pull himself together , to shrug off the chill remainder of his dream . " Carl , " Janssen went on , " you 're supposed to be lying down in there ! And what happened to your caveman suit ? " Carl could tell that behind his smile , Ken was actually mad about paying the toll and finding an empty freezer . " Sorry , folks , " Carl said . " We 're still just setting that up , but we 'll give you free passes to come back tomorrow . " Better than offering refunds . But now he had no choice but to close up for the day , something he had never done in tourist season . If he did n't get the iceman on display , everyone would be talking about him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as gracefully as he could and sent Raymond up to lock the gates . " You look about due for a vacation , " Janssen said , before he left . One quick cup of coffee later , Carl was driving toward the glacier with Raymond riding on the trailer . They saw no one all the way to the lake , which had drained further , leaving deposits of silt where the water had receded . The ice cylinder still hung from the tripod , and Raymond needed only one glance inside it . " Damn ! You really did find an iceman ! " Carl felt a moment 's relief - he had n't hallucinated that much , at least . He had Raymond pull on a rope tied to the bottom of the cylinder , while he backed the trailer into it , hoping to tilt the cylinder enough to lay it down on the trailer bed . But the sun must have softened the ice around the screws ; the cylinder had only begun to tilt when the screws pulled free , ping ping ping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the trailer hard enough to bounce Carl in his seat , then kicked back and smashed into the ice at the edge of the excavation . " God damn ! " Raymond said . " That sucker almost nailed me ! " The cylinder lay across the hole , cracked all the way through and sagging in the middle . No way to get it on the trailer now , Carl decided . The thing must weigh a ton . He gave Raymond the shovel , he took the pick , and they began breaking the ice carefully away from the body . Carl worked at the foot ; he did n't want to risk seeing those eyes that looked so blue under the ice . The first thing that came free was a pair of leather boots . Modern hiking boots . Could n't be . " Uh , Mr. Saville , you should check this out . I do n't know who it is , but this guy looks sort of familiar . " Carl needed only a glance at the face Raymond had uncovered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white man . As they chipped away , not only the boots but the rest of the clothing proved that the man had died within the last few decades . Maybe someone had hidden a body here . When they finished Carl stood up and finally took a good look at the man 's face . Suddenly , his legs wanted to run ; he looked wildly around at the ice . " Who is he ? " Raymond asked . The kid was right , the frozen man did look familiar , like someone Carl had seen long ago or in a dream . " I do n't know , but we 're going to have to call the troopers . " They dragged the body across the hole and lifted it onto the trailer , tying it down with a plastic tarp . The man was frozen stiff and hard , knees slightly bent as if he were crouching when he died , one arm extended and the other clutched to his chest . " You drive . I 'll walk . " Carl had that queasy feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to ride . As the ATV disappeared over the top of the ravine the sound of its engine abruptly died . There was no sign of Raymond or the vehicle all the way back to the resort . Not his resort anymore , he saw as he approached , but the big hotel with all the glass . Carl waited for the mirage to vanish each time he dropped out of view , but only saw it grow closer on the next rise . He climbed the moraine and stood looking at the asphalt parking lot . In a little while a shuttle bus came by and stopped . The driver , wearing a red jacket , tie , and name badge , motioned him to get on . Carl found a seat mechanically as the bus started up . " Sir , you should n't be walking out on the glacier without a guide , " the driver told him . " People have fallen or disappeared back there . " Carl looked carefully at the features along the road and surrounding mountains . This was his road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wild valley two and a half decades ago - except for the paved surface . The driver tried to chat , but Carl remained too stunned to reply . When they reached the glass hotel he knew that ground too , where his resort had been for years . The driver asked him if he needed help and did he have his room key , and Carl shook his head . What was his room number ? " I do n't have one . " " I 'm sorry , then . " The driver 's manner grew more abrupt ; apparently he acted as a security guard too . " This is a private resort . If you 're not a guest of the hotel or with an authorized tour group , I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . " A tour bus unloaded people at the front door , two bellhops removing bags from the luggage compartment . Carl wanted to look inside the hotel , but the guard was insistent . The guard watched as he walked up the road toward the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea where he was going . In half a mile he saw a brown Jeep Wagoneer coming from the highway . It left the asphalt at the curve , staying on the section line road , raising a cloud of dust as it hit gravel . Carl turned to follow before the dust had settled . He had never before set foot or tire here , never looked past the tall spruce trees at the Davisons " property line . Around the first curve he saw the Wagoneer parked in front of a small cabin among the tall spruce . The road should have continued on to the Davisons " lodge , but just past the cabin it had been blocked off with a mound of gravel and was overgrown with weeds and small trees beyond . A black Labrador retriever ran from behind the cabin , barking at his approach . A boy opened the cabin door , called the dog , and came out on the porch . " Hello , Eric , " Carl said . The boy looked at him while the Lab sniffed his leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Can I help you ? " " I .... uh .... " Carl realized his son did not know him . " I used to live around here , but things seem to have changed . " Dan 's manner softened . " Oh , I thought you were from the resort . Would you like to come in , have a cup of coffee ? " Carl saw from the door that the cabin had little more than a living room , kitchen/dining area , and two back bedrooms . He took the cup and a seat at the table across from his son , while Eric hovered nearby . The cabin smelled of coffee , of recently baked cornbread , and faintly of sweat from a pair of work coveralls which had been hung by the back door . Pans and utensils hung on the kitchen walls , and in the living room were tools and a single Machentanz print of a doomed Eskimo hunter sitting , spent , on an ice sheet that had broken free of the mainland . Though tidy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you used to live ? " Dan asked . " Up the road a ways . " Carl waved vaguely . " I used to know your folks . What happened to the Saville place ? " Dan frowned . " The Japanese bought Mom out six years ago , and my in-laws " place , and a couple others " for good measure . Tried to buy this too . Then they built that glass monstrosity  --  where it could block our view of the glacier . " Carl could see the big hotel out of the kitchen window through a clearing in the trees . " This place is all that 's left of the original homesteads in this valley , " his son continued . " I never sold out ; too many good memories , growing up around here . " " How much land do you own ? " " We 've just got the ten acres here , me and Eric . Got it for wedding presents , five from Mom and five from my in-laws . " " Did your wife ... does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced me and moved to L.A. She got our savings , and I got the place . And Eric here - the better of the deal . " Some things had n't changed at least . Carl came to where the question remaining was the one he had been afraid to ask . " What about your father ? I 'm surprised he ever sold out . " " Oh , you do n't know about Dad ? You must have been here a long time ago . He disappeared , on the glacier we think , back in the fall of " 68 . Never did find his body . Mom had to struggle to keep the place , but the Davisons - my in-laws - and other neighbors helped us out . " Carl did not respond , trying to throw off the conviction he was dreaming , having one of those dreams where everything was almost like real life , only different in a few awful ways . His son continued reminiscing . " I was just nine when he disappeared , but I have memories of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me sometimes . I remember how hard he used to work , not getting home until I was in bed , but coming in to talk if I was still awake . I remember him taking me fishing a few times , and once , not long before he died , we hiked up a mountain and found some fossils and rocks . I wish I could remember which mountain it was , " cause I 've always wanted to take Eric there . " " Do you want to see my rock collection ? " Eric asked . " Sure . " Carl 's mouth had gone dry . He looked in the cup , but he 'd drunk all the coffee except for a few brown drops that coated the bottom as he rotated the cup . He could remember those times too , plus the times he had come home too late to speak to his son and just stood for a while watching him sleep . He noticed Dan was looking at him strangely . " So you 've lost both your parents , " Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still alive . Moved to Anchorage after she sold out . We see her about twice a month . " " But .... I heard she 'd died . Of cancer . " " Nope . Still spry and healthy when I saw her last week . " It all came back to Carl then , Rebecca 's dying , too sharp and clear to have been a dream : five months of agony , half the time in the hospital , then home in bed when hope had gone . Hair falling out in thin gray wisps on the pillow . Her face wasting away until nothing but her hard bitter eyes showed above the bed covers . " Why did n't we at least go see our grandson ? " she had asked him once , near the end . And here , wherever he was now , it had n't happened that way at all . This had continued too long and consistently real to be a dream ; he had actually gone somewhere else , where things were better . Here his Rebecca still lived - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could talk to his grandson . Eric came running with a cigar box and dumped his rocks on the table . Dan shook his head and smiled ; and Carl suddenly realized , sitting there , that all three of them had the same blue , blue eyes . And knew he did not want to leave this place , even if he lost his own resort . He would tell his son who he was , go find his wife . " Rebecca , " he croaked . " Do you have her phone number ? " His son had been watching him closely . " Well , who did you say you were ? No offense , but she and her husband like their privacy , and I do n't give out their number to everyone . " " Her husband ? You said ... he ... was dead . " " No , I said my father died years ago . But she re-married about five years later . " The ceramic cup spun out of Carl 's hand and broke off its handle on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she belonged to someone else . He could n't believe it ; she had always been so loyal , and he had never thought of remarrying after her death . But of course , she had been a lot younger then . He bent to pick up the cup pieces and mumbled an apology . " So who did you say you were ? " Dan repeated . And Carl realized he would never be believed , that he would n't even know how to explain it . He had to get outside and think . He stood up . " Just an old friend , " he said . " She probably would n't even remember me . But I guess it 's time to go . Thanks for the coffee . " He left his son and grandson watching him from the front door as he went back up the road . There was nothing for him here . Rebecca was lost , as much as in his own world , and his son believed unshakably that he had died long ago . His death must be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity . He walked back toward the big hotel , leaving the road for the trees before the last curve , moving through the thinning vegetation , the wild rose , lupine , fireweed , and grasses , until he crossed over the moraine . If he went back to the ravine by the lake , maybe he could return home . Somehow that part of the glacier now existed in both worlds , created in two separate streams that must have diverged twenty-five years ago . Maybe the surge had opened a door , causing the two streams , like braids of the glacier itself , to twist and come back together . Maybe he and the frozen man could n't exist together in the same world , except there , where the streams converged . Maybe a man 's world was only a possibility , what he created from his own choices and actions . And every time he made a choice , especially a difficult or important one , one that could n't be unmade , the other possibility and all the consequences flowing from it came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both possibilities - and did n't belong in the one he had rejected . The lake was almost gone , all drained except for a small pool in the center of a bowl of muck . Raymond stood waiting by the excavation , looking as relieved to see Carl as Carl felt to see him . " I ran out of gas , " Raymond said . " Came back to look for you , and did n't know where you went . " " Where is it ? " " Not far , back there . " Raymond pointed up the ravine . " You must have walked right by it . " " I guess we should n't have disturbed the body , " Carl said . " We 'd better put it back where we found it . Go get some gas at the resort and bring it back . " Carl did n't dare leave the ravine again . After Raymond had gone he climbed on the ice ridge . He could n't see Raymond or the ATV but still saw the big hotel . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the ATV coming down the ravine . He left the tarp around the body as they replaced it in the hole ; Carl could n't look at the frozen man again . He wanted to stay with the ATV but did n't feel he could drive , so he rode on the back . They had just started up when he heard the glacier . The glacier groaned deep and low , a sound felt all over the skin as much as heard , like the song of the mother god of whales in the ocean depths , the sound coming out of the crack splitting the floor of the ravine , right between the wheels . " Get it out of here ! " He jumped off and Raymond gunned the ATV , up and out of the ravine , which was opening again into the old crevasse . Carl stumbled and slipped trying to run up the ravine , straddling the widening crack . From behind he heard the tarp sliding against ice , turned , and saw the body disappear into the crevasse . The ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line before his feet . Carl jumped . CARL WALKED UP the winding gravel road from his resort , and turned onto the section line road . Beyond the second bend , in the tall spruce trees where he knew he would find it , he walked steadily toward the cabin he had never seen in this world . The boy was playing with a dog in the yard and saw Carl approach . He came running up , stopped , and looked with big eyes . " Hello , Eric . " " Grandpa ! What are you doing here ? " " I thought I 'd come to see if maybe you 'd like to go look for fossils up on Shale Mountain . " " Sure ! " The boy 's face shone with excitement . Then he hesitated and looked at the house . " I need to ask Dad if it 's okay . " They were both walking toward the cabin . " Do you think he can go too " " Yeah . I took your dad fossil hunting up there when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The boy left him , running ahead . A man could n't unmake his choices - but he could always make new ones . Carl felt his heart hammering in his throat as he stepped up on the cabin porch . But he did n't turn back .
