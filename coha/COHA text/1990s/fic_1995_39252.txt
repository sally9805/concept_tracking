' Yde 's the name . Edward ' yde ... or Hyde , as educated folk like yourself would have it . That 's my real name , although for the past fifty years , Hyde has stayed hidden under the moniker of Edward Layman . To the good people here in the West Midlands , I 'm just Layman or Ed , no different from nobody else , a stand-up bloke , a hard-worker but no boss 's tool , fond of his pint of bitter and mild and always ready for a joke or sing-along . Only my cousin Vic  --  and now you  --  knows my real name , the one that sends chills up the world 's spine . As Hyde , I 've been called a deformed and depraved creature of Hell , a vicious human Juggernaut . " Edward Hyde , alone in the ranks of mankind , was pure evil . " Nice words , I must say . Courtesy of none other than the ultimate toffee nose , Dr. Jekyll , Harley Street specialist and a man noted for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ask . And yet , because he went to the right schools and said things in such a reasonable , sophisticated way , you believe him . Funny , how people can be educated but not smart , i'n ' it ? <p> Jekyll . Even today I ca n't hear his name without the hair on my neck rising in pure animal rage . And to think I used to admire the man . I wanted to be like him , to talk posh and live in a house filled with elegant appurtenances instead of mere furniture . Even when it finally penetrated the great Roman wall of my thick prole 's head that I was hopelessly trapped in Dr. Jekyll 's rotten web ( while he grew bloated and fat on my helpless struggles ) , I still wanted what he had . You see , Jekyll  --  let him rot in Hell , appurtenances and all  --  had class . And that , as Cousin Vic would say , is what it 's all about . <p> I was just recently turned twenty when I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life , that one stands out dearest in memory . It was a spring morning of sharp brightness , sunlight pouring in like newly minted sovereigns . Not at all the usual pewter-gray skies of London , and I was cocksure and full of myself that day . My luck was up , or so I thought . There 's something about being young that makes you feel undefeatable : I had a nice chunk of money weighing down my pockets and raw pleasure in the unfettered , wiry roll of my youthful muscles as I strolled the streets of London . The evening before , I had landed an unexpected five guineas . I 'd gone with some of my mates to one of Jimmy Wilshire 's fighting cellars . This was not one of your Marquis of Queensbury bouts of fisticuffs , but the aptly called " Big Knuckle "  --  where it 's bare knuckles and bare feet and you fight on until you or your opponent are knocked senseless . It was strictly out of the bounds of The Law , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look , you could find yourself in <p> small ill-lit room in which two brawny boyos were laying into each other on the roped-off mats in the center to the cheers of <p> crowd of red-faced men yelling themselves hoarse . And it was n't just commoners who frequented Jimmy Wilshire 's cellars , but toffs putting down pound bets on their favorites and standing close enough to the action to get blood on their evening jackets or to catch the occasional flying molar for a souvenir . <p> Hard Anthony had just knocked his opponent cold in mere minutes of combat , and the barker was now offering a purse of five guineas to anyone in the audience game enough to spend ten minutes in the ring with him . I had been an occasional stevedore on the London docks and taken part in my share of pub brawls , where the stake was your own skin and the weapons included knives , if you had one , and anything else that came to hand if you did not . So , with my friends ' raucous encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me with a friendly grin and a hand extended for a gentlemanly shake . I 'd been caught by just such a bit of commonplace treachery in one of the few street tussles I 'd lost , so I pretended to let myself be pulled off-balance but quickly ducked under the flying fist that was following up fast behind the handshake . It was Hard Anthony 's turn to be off-guard , and I took the wind out of his sails with a lightning-quick knee to the groin , the good old Ringsend uppercut . He was knackered good and proper , and though he was a tough berk , practiced in a range of dirty tricks  --  like greasing himself all over with oil so you could n't get a purchase  --  I 'm no sluggard when it comes to a barney , and it did n't take all that long before I tossed his unconscious carcass into a pile of chairs that seemed to have been placed there for just that purpose . My only injuries were <p> few scratches  --  Hard Anthony clawed like a woman  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butt . <p> That is how on a bright morning , with my head still cottony from the rounds of Jimmy Wilshire 's home-brewed gin and porter that I had treated and been treated to , I happened to be walking along Harley Street and paused for a moment next to a brass shingle announcing the name Henry Jekyll , M.D. , D.C.L. , LL.D. , F.R.S. , and enough other initials to show that the inhabitant could split himself in half and open two medical practices . It recalled to me a condition which was a cause of some embarrassment , the results of a few moments of friendliness with a comely scullery maid . Just thinking about it brought on the discomfort , a burning exaggerated by the quantity of liquor I had consumed the night before . Jingling the still half-full purse in my trouser pocket , I clambered up the stairs and pounded the fateful knocker . <p> I found myself quite humbled by my surroundings : grim Poole the manservant in his somber duds , the unobtrusively expensive furnishings , and the resounding church-like quiet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy hair combed back from his forehead , was equally imposing in his fine-tailored clothing , but he knew what he was about and had me quickly stripped and diagnosed ... a salve administered and injunctions to use more salve at regular intervals and to drink large quantities of water , only water . " For the next two weeks , you will just have to be satisfied with the fact that the City of London rocks gently upon an artesian well and not a brewery , " he said with mocking seriousness . " And , of course , abstinence of another kind for the same period is a definite must . " <p> All this was something I could easily live with , and I was relieved to have taken care of the problem so easily . A quite different shock was in store for me . The bill Jekyll presented me with was for five guineas . I now eyed the gracious furniture with bitterness , having seen how it came to be purchased . This was more than I earned in two weeks of stevedoring and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse that I now emptied onto the tabletop . Three pounds six was all that was left after the previous night 's generosity . <p> " That 's all I 've got , governor . And for me that 's a tidy sum of money . " <p> " I 've no doubt . But I 'm not so sure the police would see it in that light . " Jekyll looked at me thoughtfully , murmuring to himself : " A fine example of the unconscious brute side of human nature . Enters here without a thought to payment and consequences ... a certain animal magnetism ... the beast happy in its ignorant cavern .. " <p> He grew contemplative , studying me for a while . Then he began to question me closely as to how I had come about the bruise under my eye and other particulars . When I balked at telling him at length of the source of my little illness , he gazed at me coldly and offered to dispatch Poole to seek out the nearest policeman . But when I told him the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the coal shuttle of her employers ' house , his friendliness returned , and he smiled delightedly while he drank in the details like a navvy confronted with his first pint of shoretime ale . <p> " Marvelous , " he said , examining his own plump , manicured hand with manifest satisfaction . " It 's an ill wind that brings no good , Mr. Hyde . I think we can come to an arrangement that will be of benefit to both of us . <p> " You see before you , " he continued , " a man who is known and respected throughout all London  --  a doer of good deeds , a pillar of society . My stature , nay , my very upbringing ... the air I breathe in these luxurious chambers constrains me to act always in a civilized manner . Not for me the brute spontaneity of a quick dalliance behind the coal scuttle , the thump on the head for the fool who dares look at me cross-eyed . No , I must comfort myself with decency at all times , fettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as the gallows thief is prevented from fleeing to freedom by his leg irons ... " <p> Jekyll continued in this manner for some time . I did not understand all of what he was saying at that instant , but I gathered that I was to be his proxy . My work was to indulge in my animal lusts , and all I had to do was report my doings to Dr. Jekyll in order to be forgiven my debt and receive a handsome retainer besides . <p> " Go forth and be wicked , Hyde , " Jekyll intoned as he let me out the back door of his building , the entrance I was to use from now on in any communication with him . <p> At first , I thought that Dr. Jekyll was either cracked or just plain having me on , but the following Friday  --  the date he had set for our next encounter  --  curiosity took my feet down the back lane on the far side of Harley Street . On my way there , an odd incident occurred . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing a child 's hoop , which she kept balanced by tapping it with a light cane , that she ran full-tilt into me . I lifted her up , helped her retrieve the hoop , and gave her a halfpenny to bring back the smile to her limpid , innocent face . <p> Approaching the cellar door , I rapped once on its thick oak paneling , thinking that if there was no response , I could chalk the whole thing off to a moment 's eccentricity on the doctor 's part . To my surprise , the door swung open immediately , and Jekyll ushered me inside with every sign of having eagerly been awaiting my arrival . <p> " So , my good Hyde , what acts of gross turpitude have you committed since last we met ? " he demanded . <p> Since I had been obeying his orders to stay clear of intoxicating beverages , my time had passed slowly and with little opportunity for mischief . Racking my brains , I thought of a little trick I had played some months before on a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , always checking the balance of his weighing scales to make quite sure some poor old missis was n't getting away with a free sliver of fin or tail . While my best butty , Townsend , distracted the man  --  " What 's this , then ? A grouper ? Never heard of it . Got any eels ? I could go for a nice eel "  --  I quickly nicked a couple of the weights that served to balance out the scale in graded half ounces . Pretending it had happened just days before , I narrated this history , much to Dr. Jekyll 's delight . <p> " Capital , Hyde , capital . A little rough justice , if you will . And what else ? What other means has Satan found to tempt you ? " <p> I was forced to plunder my memory 's storehouse  --  surely I had not done only good deeds in the interval ?  --  when , suddenly , inspiration struck . I told Jekyll the story of the child and her hoop ... only , this time there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , I joyously trod the helpless infant into the ground with my heavy work boots , indifferent to her terrified screams . Jekyll shivered as I described how the little hoop cracked underfoot like a chicken bone . <p> " And you did n't look back at all , Hyde ? " he asked , rubbing his hands with glee . <p> " Not even once , Dr. Jekyll . Not once . " <p> Jekyll gave me ten pounds and said he looked forward to our meeting the following week . As I was leaving , he called me back . " It 's almost noon now . If you walk towards Cavendish Square , you 'll be sure to encounter a stout gentleman dressed in a finely tailored charcoal-gray overcoat complete with beaver-skin top hat . In all likelihood , he 'll have in his hands an ebony cane that is the very twin of this one . The man 's name is Utterson , and he has an appointment with me . Spatter some mud on him for me  --  hey , Hyde ? Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overcoat . " <p> For all his sophistication , Dr. Jekyll 's notion of evil-doing was still that of a schoolboy . <p> For about six months , the arrangement between Jekyll and myself was useful for us both . For Jekyll , it was a chance to experience vicariously a lifestyle at complete odds with his habitual one . For me , it was a steady source of good money ... but more than that , it was an opportunity to live outside the limits of my ilk and income . I valued the time spent with Jekyll , and I even borrowed some of his books to go through afterwards in my own time . Jekyll had a command of the Queen 's English that I frankly envied , and I would find myself assuming some of his mannerisms and using some of his more eloquent locutions . See ?  --  " locutions , " that 's <p> Jekyll word . His influence is with me even now . <p> Of course , there were difficulties . One day , I wore to our cellar meeting a fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the money I had saved up . When he saw me in it , far from being flattered , he was furious . <p> " I pay you because you bring me the stink of the gutter , Hyde , not the scent of Savile Row , " he railed . " Do n't try to turn yourself into a gentleman , my boy . It would be a ridiculous sight : like <p> bullock laying eggs ! " <p> He softened a little under my injured glare . " Come now , do n't look at me like that . I suppose we all have a right to play at being what we 're not  --  I , to be a brute , and you , to be a fine gentleman  --  but we need to keep some perspective , not let it go to our heads . " <p> I suppose if that had been the only problem , I could have borne with it without too much complaint . What did it matter if Jekyll mocked at my lack of education , and even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let him be superior and condescending . It did n't stop me from learning what I wanted to learn . As Vic says about me , I can talk management , and I can talk mates . <p> No , the real problem was a certain universal fact of human nature : yesterday 's vice is worth about as much as yesterday 's daily paper . The wine of my evil deeds soon stopped intoxicating Jekyll ; he must have stronger stuff ! From being content to hear about my misdeeds , he went to being an observer ... then observer became participant , and the downfall of us both was assured . <p> It started off with Jekyll having me stage a bare-fist bout in his capacious cellar . The audience was " a select few " of Jekyll 's friends , men whom he trusted , classmates and old boys from Jekyll 's public school . Among them was Utterson , who chose not to recognize in me the churl who had befouled his greatcoat with a hearty slap on the back . Another was a spry , white-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer of the realm , no less . We put on a good show for the fine gentlemen . Too good a show , in fact , for I got carried away one day and beat my opponent , a young ruffian I 'd known from the docks , into an insensate pulp <p> You see , as Jekyll became more depraved in his desires , so I became more corrupt . I came to revel in the role into which he had cast me , like a music hall performer who forgets that it 's all a mickey-take . With the money Jekyll gave me , I found I could buy the downtrodden , attractive youth of London . There was not a young household maid or messenger lad that I could not entice into Jekyll 's cellar , where the practice of vice had achieved a rare pitch of refinement . These are memories I prefer not to call to mind , the times I spent swaggering around the city bullying my peers with my own physical strength and Jekyll 's pecuniary wherewithal . My encounters with women ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprieve from the cares of daily life . Instead , they were a transaction . <p> Things began to heat up for me , dangers that were the result of my new life . Jimmy Wilshire was out to get me for intruding on his territory , or so it was rumored . Hard Anthony himself was supposed to be waiting for me in some dark lane or courtyard , armed with cosh and shiv . At first I did n't care . I borrowed Jekyll 's tough ebony cane and let it be known on the street that Hard Anthony had better stay out of my way . But there were other things that did begin to bother me : the way my former mates avoided me or only sought me out when the need for lucre grew overpowering . The hard-edged way the girls now looked at me ... how they let me debauch them with my five- and ten-pound notes . People had become afraid of me . The drubbing I 'd given to my youthful sparring partner ( it had cost me a tidy sum to mollify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of city lore and was much exaggerated in the telling . Even Townsend , the jokester who had grown up just two houses away from me and who as long as I knew him was always up for a lark ... he only came to me when he needed money , acted sullen and fearful , let me push him around without answering back . I was coming to know Jekyll 's loneliness , the knowledge that no one gives a hoot for you yourself but only for the bit of silver that might fall their way . Not to say I did n't take pride in my newfound power  --  in the very independence Jekyll 's money bought me  --  but it was slowly , much too slowly , beginning to sink in that all this was playacting . I had given up my own soul to become another man 's thrall . <p> I will not bore you , dear Reader , with a lengthy account of my downward spiral in the ensuing months . Jekyll himself berated me for " opening the gates of Hell " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever more wanton acts of dissipation . One moment he would threaten to bring in The Law on the grounds that I was extorting money from him , the next moment he would beg me not to disrupt his only true moments of pleasure . Many times I thought of simply disappearing , of leaving without a word , but always the lure of Jekyll 's fascinating character  --  along with the sense of invincibility brought on by a steady supply of cash and the protecting shield of the doctor 's reputation  --  brought me back . The truth is that I , too , was addicted to the heady fumes of unbridled wickedness , the gratifying crunch of cartilage beneath knuckle , the wild debauches in the cellar . And yet I was racked by the twin goads of conscience and fear . As Jekyll one day said , we were " like man 's twin demons of good and evil locked in mortal embrace while our worldly bark teeters on the edge of the waterfall . " <p> Late one night , as all things must , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dark , brooding nights when all but the friendless are home in a warm bed beside the pale embers of a dying fire . Patches of mist floated hither and yon like untethered wraiths , and I wandered alone like them , lost in embittered reflection . All of a sudden , a slender , white-haired figure appeared in front of me . It was Sir Danvers Carew , who seemed both surprised and delighted to see me here . Carew was a quiet sort , with the distinguished air of a man who knows his own importance . He kept himself aloof during our mad carousals , but he was always there to the last minute , smiling to himself , sitting a little to one side . <p> " Ah , it 's Henry Jekyll 's hired bravo , " Carew remarked in his melodious voice , and began to inquire earnestly and sympathetically after my health . In the next moment , he made a proposal to me of such audacious indecency that my mind reeled . Suddenly , the Spirit of Justice , of right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as in a pressure boiler , rose up with irresistible force . With a shout , I sprang upon Carew and knocked him to the ground , where I dealt out my answer to his disgusting suggestion with Jekyll 's ebony cane . A moment later I came to my senses , and tossing the shattered cudgel aside , I fled . <p> I wandered away from the city on foot , my mind cast loose from its moorings . For several days I walked , stopping only occasionally to rest or buy some food , and eventually I found myself in the West Midlands , the industrial heart of our fabled isle . It was late afternoon , but it might as well have been night , the way the clouds of factory smoke blotted out the pallid sun . The clang of machinery was almost deafening , and here and there flames shot out to silhouette a human figure as a boiler door was opened to feed the mechanical beast . The place uncannily resembled an oil painting of Hell that had hung in Jekyll 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I could preserve my anonymity in the midst of other rough , working folks like myself . I remembered that a favorite cousin lived here , Vic Goodston , and by dint of asking in various local pubs , I was soon able to locate him . Vic helped me get a job at a local foundry , where the softened pads of my fingers and palms soon acquired the callouses of forthright toil . It was work that brought me back to myself . No thought was required , none of the fancy words I had learned while hanging about with the upper crust ... just a steady hand and muscles that could endure a full day of shoveling coal into a giant , blasting furnace . <p> As my mind healed itself , the fear that I would be discovered and hauled oft to the gallows became ever stronger . Vic 's discrete inquiries helped allay my fears as we gradually pieced together the story of why Scotland Yard was no longer searching for the violent madman and killer , Edward Hyde . The first shock was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hand . Before downing the deadly draught of prussic acid , he had written out <p> lengthy manuscript , detailing the fiction you all know so well . <p> Do n't believe for a moment that Jekyll was motivated by any desire to aid the man he had so grievously injured . No , Jekyll was simply being true to his race  --  avoiding the scandal that would bring down not only himself , but his friend Utterson and the rest of the select crowd who frequented Jekyll 's cellar . The world could not be allowed to think that its most elite denizens harbored tastes that can charitably be called unsavory . No , far better if society should think that by taking a few salt compounds , the noble Jekyll was turned into a beast , a mere day laborer , a stinking , odious hand-for-hire controlled not by his brain but his brute instincts . It was a fabrication that would not have taken in a child , but the bonded word of aristocrats like Utterson and of the police detectives , whose nests were feathered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convince a gullible public . I suppose I should be grateful to Jekyll for providing me with a way out , <p> substantial grant on my lease in this vale of tears , but I 'm not . There 's no reason to believe he did it for me . There 's no reason to believe he ever saw me as his fellow . He took no more notice of the man who carried out the whims of his lowest self than he would have of the bootblack who put shine to his shoes . <p> There have been many times , though , when I 've lain sleepless at night harried by the knowledge that my safety was illusory ... that perhaps I did n't disappear into the anonymity of the working world , but my whereabouts were known to Jekyll 's friends , to be revealed or not as it suited them . Lately , it has come to me that I 'd been gulled more than I knew . All those learned treatises about the duality of man and the thin veneer of civilization that appeared after Jekyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a load of bollocks . I sense Jekyll 's hand in this somewhere , his love of deceit and subterfuge . How can we be sure it was his body in that casket borne by grim procession to Highgate Cemetery ? London 's morgue is full of happy dossers who have shucked off this mortal coil without friend or relation to mourn or identify them . Would it not be like Dr. Henry Jekyll to get another  --  some unknown , some anonymous roustabout , whose passing has left not a ripple on the surface of the London " that matters "  --  to take his place on that final journey while he sequesters himself at <p> friend 's country estate or sojourns on the continent ? It amazes me that I did not consider this possibility before , but blithely and blindly pursued my rounds of honest toil while Jekyll  --  my tormentor , my gilded double  --  remained alive , chuckling to himself at the stupidity of the inferior classes . How easily we are fooled . How unfailingly we accept even the most obvious fictions . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the unpalatable truth goes begging . Dupes , all of us . And you , too , Reader . Wot'cher . <p>
