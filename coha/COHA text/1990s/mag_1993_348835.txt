TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TAKE MEDICINE TO control hypertension , or high blood pressure , and most of them  --  and their doctors  --  presume that many of the available pills are interchangeable . Now two studies in the current New England Journal of Medicine have shown that this conventional wisdom is quite wrong , and the finding could change the way these medicines are prescribed . <P> The first study compared two similar ( but not identical ) drugs , captopril and enalapril , both of which are safe and effective . Surprisingly , the patients on captopril reported feeling better physically and emotionally  --  and sleeping more soundly  --  than those taking enalapril . The second study tested six drugs and found that their effectiveness at controlling blood pressure depended on who was taking them . Diltiazem worked especially well for black men , captopril for younger white men , and atenolol for older white men . The results will undoubtedly prompt studies in women as well .                  @ @ @
