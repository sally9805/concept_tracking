<p> Larry Lenig , president of the Houston seismic company Grant Geophysical , clearly relishes his role as a niche player in the oil-field services industry . But then again , what choice does he have ? <p> Grant , which emerged from bankruptcy last year , had 750 employees and revenues of $ 135 million last year . Compare that with its chief competitor , Western Atlas , which is about to merge with Baker Hughes to create a company with 36,000 employees and $ 6.5 billion in revenues . <p> " I do n't think there is anything wrong with being a niche player , " said Lenig , who helped lead Grant out of bankruptcy , and also led a similar turnaround at another seismic company , Digicon , which later became Veritas DGC . <p> With the upcoming mergers of Halliburton Co. and Dresser Industries , and Baker Hughes and Western Atlas , the already wide gap between the biggest companies providing seismic services and the small players is getting wider . This vast size disparity forces Houston 's smaller seismic companies to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Schlumberger and Western Atlas dominate the business of using sound waves to pinpoint oil and gas reservoirs , with about 40 percent of the market . But companies such as Petroleum Geo-Services , Grant Geophysical , Veritas DGC , Seitel , Eagle Geophysical , GeoScience Corp . and Input/Output have still been able to stake out profitable venues . <p> " If you look at the smaller seismic companies , or any other subsegment of the services industry , they do n't have the financial resources to be everything to everybody , " said Dan Pickering , head of research for Simmons &; Co . International in Houston . " So that forces them to concentrate on a niche . " <p> The companies ' respective footholds cover the spectrum of the seismic universe . <p> Grant and Eagle offer seismic data gathering services . <p> Input/Output and GeoScience stick to making and selling seismic equipment . <p> Seitel mainly runs a data library and contracts crews from its competitors to gather seismic data . <p> Petroleum Geo-Services offers floating production platforms in addition to marine seismic services . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company in gathering and analyzing seismic data in deepwater areas . <p> Seismic companies that have secured their customers by keeping up with the advances in technology will lose them if they do not make the investment in both hardware and people to keep up , Lenig said . <p> " You have to grab , and be willing to hold onto , a niche while being focused and nimble , " Lenig said . " It 's not the easiest thing to do . " <p> As the energy industry surged in 1997 , there was more than enough work for seismic crews worldwide . But with depressed oil prices threatening exploration budgets , competition for seismic jobs is expected to get fiercer . <p> " Companies who are well acquainted with the particulars of a geographic region or who are perhaps more well versed than their competitors in offering a particular service can make very nice returns if they stick to their knitting , " Lenig said . <p> Investors have earned some nice returns , but some of them are hoping for more than growing profits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent this year , driven by expectations of a takeover bid . Its stock hit a 52-week high in May , two days after Baker Hughes said it planned to buy Western Atlas for $ 5 billion in stock and assumed debt . <p> The takeover speculation has since died down , said David Robson , chairman and chief executive of Veritas in Houston . <p> The takeover buzz was " very disruptive to our employees , " Robson said , adding that the rumors were all based on speculation . " There were no discussions behind it , " he said . <p> He does not believe the Baker Hughes/Western Atlas merger will have any short-term impact on Veritas , which competes with Western Atlas in seismic data acquisition and processing both onshore and offshore . <p> Veritas is one of numerous seismic companies viewed as prime takeover targets . Others include Seitel , Petroleum Geo-Services , which has its U.S. headquarters in Houston , and Companie Generale de Geophysique of France , the world 's No. 3 seismic company . <p> Veritas ' focus is seismic surveys in waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepwater area is considered the only sure bet as energy companies cut back spending on less-promising areas , said Bill Herbert , oil-field services analyst with Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs in Houston . <p> " Oil-field services are subject to a lot more volatility today with commodity prices weakened , " Herbert said . <p> Not all the players have been successfully meeting the competitive challenges of the industry . <p> Universal Seismic Associates has had a rocky year , beginning with the resignation of Coopers &; Lybrand as its auditors in February and continuing with its delisting from the Nasdaq in March because it did not meet the minimum requirement for tangible assets . In August of last year it had to borrow $ 2 million against its seismic equipment to settle a shareholder lawsuit . <p> Company officials could not be reached for comment . <p> Petroleum Geo-Services was contacted about a possible merger by Baker Hughes about six months ago , and declined , said Chris Boswell , chief financial officer at the company . <p> The company has focused all of its seismic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong presence , but it has also branched out into designing and selling floating production , storage and offloading platforms . <p> " The ( floating platform ) business adds a little more stability to our revenues , " Boswell said . " We were tied to exploration budgets but this business is under long-term contracts and comes from the production budget , which tends to be much more stable . " <p> Petroleum Geo-Services has had discussions with some drillers about alliances but is not looking for a merger partner , Boswell said . <p> " We do n't feel they need to buy a seismic company to achieve what they are after , " he said . <p> Seitel feels its niche has insulated it from the recent declines in oil prices . Its seismic database - second only to Western Atlas ' massive library - is all the more crucial when a company is deciding where and when to drill a well in times of lean profits , said Russell Hoffman , spokesman for the company . <p> " When oil prices decline , demand for seismic rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drilling , " Hoffman said . " It happened in 1994 and it is happening in 1998 . " <p> The Baker Hughes/Western Atlas merger is not going to change the way Seitel does business in any fashion , Hoffman said . <p> Seitel officials are not concerned , he added , that the large mergers will usher in an era when smaller players are edged out by large companies offering to provide a full range of services in a package deal . In so-called " life of the field " projects , for example , one company oversees a field 's development from seismic surveys to drilling to production management . <p> " I firmly believe that the oil companies are not going to go to just one vendor , " Hoffman said . " There are always going to be at least two or three vendors . Monopolies will not be allowed . " <p> Seitel is also one of the seismic companies that has branched out into oil and gas exploration , as a way to maximize the payoff from its technological expertise . This practice caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the potential conflict of interest when Seitel was mapping out both its own exploration prospects and those of its competitors . <p> That controversy has vanished and other seismic companies have followed Seitel 's lead . On June 10 , Seitel announced four successful new wells in south Louisiana . During 1997 , the company booked about $ 26 million in oil and gas revenues out of its $ 127 million in total revenues . <p> And despite its problems , Universal Seismic recently reported it had successfully drilled and completed 11 natural gas wells near Victoria in partnership with Edge Petroleum . <p> Input/Output also has had some success with oil and gas exploration in addition to selling seismic equipment , although the amount of revenue it books from oil and gas sales is not broken out from the total . <p> Its chairman , W.J. " Zeke " Zeringue , is a 25-year veteran of the oil-field services business . He was president of Halliburton Energy Services until November of last year . <p> " We probably have a pretty unique position in the role we play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeringue said . He noted that Input/Output counts Western Atlas among its customers and expects to continue that relationship after the merger . <p> He believes the successful seismic niche players will continue to be attractive takeover targets . <p> " The consolidation going on is kind of a natural process , " Zeringue said . <p> Seismic market <p> Market shares of companies in the seismic industry : <p> Companie Generale de Geophysique : 13% <p> Petroleum Geo-Services : 10% <p> Veritas DGC : 7% <p> Others : 30% <p> Western Atlas : 20% <p> Schlumberger : 20%
