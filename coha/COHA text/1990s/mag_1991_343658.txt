When coal miners in Siberia 's Kuzbass region walked off the job in early March , they vowed not to return until Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had resigned . Last week , with Gorbachev still in office , the miners ended their strike , but only after he ceded Kremlin control of the coalpits to the Russian republic . <P> The deal , seen by some Soviet observers as the beginning of the end of central control over major industries , stemmed from a pact signed three weeks ago by Gorbachev and his sometime rival , Boris Yeltsin , head of the Russian republic . Criticized by miners and fellow reformers for his accommodation with Gorbachev , Yeltsin spent three days in Siberia lobbying for a " dignified solution " to the strikes . Yeltsin vowed to turn ownership of the mines over to workers as soon as possible and to allow the mines to keep 80% of their hard-currency earnings . <P> But Yeltsin 's victory could backfire . By winning control over Russia 's coal mines , Yeltsin inherits an industry steeped in debt and badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspend their strike for only two months , lest Yeltsin prove no better than Gorbachev at settling grievances .
