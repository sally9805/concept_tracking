<p> Contrary to frequent charges , Bush Administration officials are thinking about the postwar peace process . The direction of their brainstorming will displease knee-jerk advocates of an international Mideast conference and give Yasir Arafat a well-deserved diplomatic body blow . <p> The ideas , and they are only ideas at this point , are grandiose and sound tinny to a political ear . But they spring from the shocks of war and the power of dreams  --  the stuff that breakthroughs are made of . <p> One track , encased in regionwide plans for economic cooperation and arms control , would try to clear the way for negotiations between two of the region 's most bitter enemies , Israel and Syria . This regional effort , and not a Mideast conference , would be the diplomatic starting point . <p> The second and parallel track would be laid by a generous Israeli offer to West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians for direct talks . The aim would be to make it tempting and possible for Palestinian locals to split from P.L.O . headquarters in Tunis . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although his early retirement to the post of color commentator for CNN would clearly benefit any peace process . The most immediate obstacle to the two tracks is not Saddam Hussein , but his now popular demand for an international conference . <p> Such a conclave would produce only endless haggling over its own powers and guarantee Israel 's isolation and intransigence . But Administration officials know that the U.S. can not simply discard the idea . Britain , France and several Arab countries are paying dues in war and will expect it as their pound of peace . The challenge for Washington will be to convince them that the conference might serve a useful purpose if convened later rather than sooner . <p> The right partners to start negotiations are Israel and Syria , under the rubric of a Mideast-wide conference on military and economic cooperation . They hold the key to future stability in the region . The pivotal question is Syrian President Assad 's willingness to play . His historical instinct would be to reach for undisputed leadership of the radical Arab world , whatever Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is neither a romantic nor a masochist . He is a consummate strategist whose dispatch of Syrian troops to defend Saudi Arabia shows an appreciation of new strategic realities . He no longer has his Soviet military protector and is without funds . To rebuild his shattered economy , he can turn only to Saudi Arabia . The Saudis can use this dependence to nudge him toward talks with Israel . And it is to Israel that he must turn to fulfill his dream of restoring the Golan Heights to Syrian sovereignty . <p> Prime Minister Shamir shares the Syrian dictator 's unromantic personality . Yet he and his fellow hard-liners make no secret of their willingness to probe Damascus on peace . They also know that if Mr. Assad would deal with them , the fearful Saudis and Jordanians would be close behind . <p> But none of these Arab states would dare talk directly to Israel unless Mr. Shamir opened the second track for negotiations with the Palestinians . With all Palestinians in a state of shock and disarray , the moment could be ripe for an imaginative Israeli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatever Saddam Hussein 's future , the P.L.O . leader and his organization will be losers . They will get no more money from the Saudis , and neither Israel nor Washington will let him back into the negotiating picture . <p> The Arafat blunder creates the possibility of Israel 's doing what it has always desired  --  ignoring Mr. Arafat and negotiating directly with the Palestinians in the occupied territories . <p> But no new group of Palestinian leaders will risk stepping forward unless Israel makes them an offer they can not refuse . At a minimum , this means the right to organize their own elections and government , and not foreclosing their dream of a Palestinian state . <p> Israeli officials have been hinting at similar thoughts . For they have a dream of their own  --  absorbing a whole new generation of Israelis from the Soviet Union , a dream even many Israeli hardheads now sense will die unless Palestinians are reconciled . <p> Historically , the power of Middle Eastern dreams has derived from their single-mindedness and exclusivity . The separate dreams of Arabs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by ruminating on how to use the gulf crisis to retrack these dreams , Administration officials are on to something bold and attractive .
