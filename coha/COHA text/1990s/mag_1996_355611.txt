Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner are n't the kind of people who say , " I told you so . " But if anyone in TV has a right to say it , they do . The former ABC programming executives , who teamed up to form their own production company in 1981 , brought one of their early projects , a family sitcom starring a well-worn comedian , to their old network  --  only to have it rejected . NBC later put The Cosby Show on the air , and it became the most popular series of the 1980s . The producers ' next breakthrough hit , Roseanne , landed on ABC only after NBC turned it down . And last season they tried to interest ABC in a wacky sitcom about an alien family on Earth . When the network dithered over scheduling it , the duo took 3rd Rock from the Sun to NBC  --  where it became the season 's only unqualified hit . <P> Now Carsey and Werner , arguably the most powerful producers in television , are enjoying the last laugh : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carsey-Werner , their company , produced three pilots last spring , and amazingly  --  in a business where a .300 batting average makes you a candidate for MVP  --  all three were picked up for the fall schedule : Cosby by CBS , Men Behaving Badly by NBC and Townies by ABC . <P> That gives Carsey-Werner a total of seven shows on the air this fall ( Roseanne , Grace Under Fire , Cybill and 3rd Rock are its incumbents ) , more than any other independent production company  --  though there are n't many independent companies left for comparison . As media mergers proliferate and most small producers have sought shelter under the umbrella of a studio , Carsey and Werner are determined to keep going it alone . In doing so , they have proved that a couple of smart programmers with good instincts and enough confidence to fight for what they believe in can still be a power in prime time . <P> Carsey , 51 , and Werner , 46 , are the most unassuming moguls in Hollywood . They share an office on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot in Studio City and rarely go out for fancy lunches , preferring to grab a plate in the commissary line downstairs . Intensely private , both have families ( Carsey is married to a former comedy writer and has two children ; Werner and his businesswoman wife have three ) that they keep out of the limelight . Carsey drives a modest Mustang convertible ; Werner tools around in a Toyota Landcruiser . Carsey does n't even have an answering machine on her home phone . They are so low-profile that even Daily Variety not long ago referred to them , mistakenly , as husband and wife . <P> Within the industry , however , their talents are hardly a mystery . Last spring Disney-ABC chief Michael Eisner tried to convince Carsey and Werner to take over the network 's struggling entertainment division . They were tempted but said no , partly because it would have meant giving up their company and abandoning their new shows in the midst of development . The company , worth an estimated $1 billion , is growing fast , with a newly created distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndication rights for their biggest shows ) and a fledgling movie division . Still , they do n't rule out the idea of someday leaving it all to run a network . " We have always had an interest in the programming side of television , " says Werner . " It would be difficult to give up what we have here , but nothing 's impossible . "
