<p> Two years ago , when the greens and fairways were no more than dirt hills , Jan and Chuck Eldridge stood looking over the ridges , valleys and woods that would become the Sugarloaf Country Club . The couple was living in Russia but were in Atlanta for the Olympics when friends drove them out to Duluth for their first look at a 1,430-acre community-in-the-works . <p> " It was just mud , but even then , we said , ' We 're coming back and living here , ' " recalled Jan Eldridge . " We loved the sweeping views . It was n't even close to being a golf course yet , but when Greg Norman put his name on it , we figured we could n't go wrong . " <p> A few months after the Olympics left town , the Eldridges returned and became one of the first families to move into a house alongside the Sugarloaf golf course . But once in their new home overlooking the 10th hole , the Eldridges were n't prepared for what they found in the upscale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 2.5 million . <p> " We just had no idea what we were in for , " said Jan Eldridge . " We loved the amenities  --  the golf course , the tennis courts  --  but what we got was a lot more . It 's not just the lovely homes and views , but the people . Everyone who comes out here says this is such a wonderful family place to be . People are so family-oriented ; there are so many activities from Halloween to Christmas parties , where we collect for needy families . It has the most caring attitude of any place I 've ever lived , with Southern hospitality to the max . " <p> Vincent and Robin Brown were also unprepared for what they found on their first visit to Sugarloaf . <p> " I never lived in a country club , and it really did n't appeal to me , " admitted Vincent Brown , a former New England Patriots football player who now works for an investment firm in Dunwoody . " But you do n't get the sense of an old-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . We have two young kids , and as we drove through , we saw more kids moving in and a diverse mix of people in the neighborhood . We felt this would be the place to raise our kids . " <p> " We had friends who lived in Duluth , but at first , I could n't talk ( my husband ) into looking out here , " said Robin Brown . " But we found it was really low-key . " <p> Having a guarded and gated entry made the couple feel even more secure about their choice . " It makes sure that people in the neighborhood are here for their intended purpose , " said Vincent Brown . " I feel secure letting my son run down the street . " <p> The couple 's two-story brick house was under construction during their initial visits , and it captured their attention with its curb appeal . <p> " It did n't feel too big , " said Vincent Brown , of the 6,000-square-foot home with its granite kitchen counters , solid wood cabinets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were attracted to being a part of a community with Georgia 's only Tournament Players Club , a PGA Tour-managed facility . " You ca n't beat having a TPC in the neighborhood , " said Vincent Brown . " I have friends who live on other courses who are trying to get over here . It 's one of the hardest courses in the state . " <p> With the edge of their back yard snuggling up to the first green , Glen and Joyce Tarpley McIntosh had ringside seats when golfers Tiger Woods , Jay Don Blake and Lee Janzen made their rounds during the BellSouth Classic , the PGA Tour event Sugarloaf has hosted in May for the past two years . For the two tournament weeks this year , the community 's gate was opened to more than 135,000 spectators . <p> " The kids and I were out at 6 a.m. to see Woods , even though we 're not golfers , " recalls Tarpley McIntosh , who is part of a women 's golf class at the club . <p> The McIntoshes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of that time were only a few miles from Sugarloaf . <p> " This was a cow pasture that we used to call the Rollins Ranch , " said Tarpley McIntosh . " We could see it from Old Peachtree ( Road ) . " <p> The property got its nickname from one-time owner O. Wayne Rollins , an entrepreneur who stabled show horses there until his death in the early 1980s . For years , the property was owned by Eastern Airlines , which sold the land when it was in bankruptcy in 1994 . <p> When the first signs for Sugarloaf went up , the developers , Crescent Resources , passed out information request forms at the gatehouse . <p> " When I got here in late 1995 , we already had 900 inquiries , " said resident Buddy Parrish , Sugarloaf 's director of sales and marketing . " We were amazed at the number of people who watched it go up . " <p> For the McIntoshes , the location was ideal  --  close to work , church , shopping centers and the schools they liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did n't want to go anywhere else , " said Tarpley McIntosh . " But it seemed like everything exciting and fun was in north Fulton . Here , we liked that it was a planned community , with proximity to Lake Lanier as well as Duluth . " <p> Last December , the family settled into a 6,300-square-foot , stucco house with a soaring , 20-foot foyer and grand room , keeping-room kitchen and four bedrooms . " And from the upstairs hallway , you can see beautiful sunrises and sunsets across the practice fields , " said Tarpley McIntosh . <p> Sugarloaf 's European , Georgian and classically traditional homes , ranging from 3,000 to 11,000 square feet , are spread out among walking trails , lakes and the course . The neighborhood also includes a white-columned , antebellum clubhouse with a bright red roof , designed to remind residents and visitors of a house that may have once anchored the rolling acreage all around . <p> There are three pools and 210-foot water flume next to the seven-court tennis center . It includes a restored 15-stall barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tack rooms . The center also includes a tennis pro shop and recreation center with an aerobics room , snack bar , game room , surround-sound theater and computer library that 's become a gathering place for the neighborhood children . <p> And there 's usually a crowd of children in Julie and Richard Cox 's front yard , which the South African couple calls " the cricket lawn . " <p> " My kids had made friends before we even moved in , and they were excited , " said Julie Cox , who moved in last June . " Our main focus was education with the kids , and we limited ourselves to areas with regard to that . " <p> When they found a stucco two-story house on the 13th fairway , the decision to move to Sugarloaf was made . " We love the trim work ; it 's just beautiful , with a lot of detail , " said Julie Cox . " Everyone walks around on the weekends , looking at other houses being built , and mine is known as the staircase house because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer . There are not many around like this ; it 's breathtaking when you walk in . We were interested in a golf course community because my husband 's a golfer . The kids are golfing , and I 'm trying . " <p> The club offers several membership levels , with initiation fees ranging from $ 2,000 to $ 38,000 .

Wayne Rollins , a businessman , sold 2,000 acres just north of Duluth to Eastern Airlines . The property was zoned residential , but for years had held only the Rollins ' retreat , a riding ring and stables . When Eastern folded , 1,430 acres were purchased by Crescent Resources , while the remaining land was zoned for commercial use . Ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rollins house was converted to an office ; the barn renovated into a recreation area with a tennis pro shop , video arcade , nursery , snack bar and lounge . Renowned golfer Greg Norman designed the course . For the last two years , the neighborhood has welcomed some of the world 's best golfers who played in the BellSouth Classic , a PGA Tour event .
