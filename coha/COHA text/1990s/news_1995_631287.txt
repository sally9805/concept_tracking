<p> Pausing during our stroll across Jackson Square , my family joined the crowd around a street juggler , enjoying his corny jokes and tricks . Then we became part of his act . <p> First the juggler , Chris , plucked Ryan from the fringe of the audience . My 8-year-old slowly acknowledged that he had never " juggled professionally . " <p> Within 30 seconds , Ryan was twirling and flipping a weighted baton between 2-foot-long sticks  --  Chris ' hands engulfing and moving Ryan 's forearms . <p> Then Chris had me lie on my back . Chris put a top hat over my eyes ; then he tied my shoelaces together . When he removed the hat , I saw he was juggling three clubs , directly above my crotch . <p> Everyone else seemed to find this wildly funny , and afterward , Ryan and his brother , Michael , treated me as a celebrity . I treated Chris with respect . <p> This ad lib twirl at showbiz is typical of the fun children can have during a visit to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . <p> The Crescent City simply has n't marketed itself to families in a proper way . We filled four days and a couple of nights with kid-oriented stuff and had to forgo other attractions for lack of time . <p> Planning helps assure any successful vacation , and my notes from three guidebooks and some tourism brochures overflowed a full page of a legal pad . Another page held notes about restaurants that would accommodate children . <p> With maps that detail the famed French Quarter as well as the larger city area , tourists with children can take in two or three major attractions a day without retracing their steps . <p> To save walking and time , buy a VisiTour Pass , good for unlimited trips on the city 's buses , shuttles and trolleys for three days ; the pass costs $ 8 , whereas individual rides are 50 cents to $ 1.25 ( exact change only ) . A car is not necessary to reach most of the attractions listed here , and driving in the French Quarter is a chore . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something extra " and is the feel-good ethic in New Orleans , here 's a list of a dozen or so top attractions for children . The places are arranged as a guide for a four-day visit . <p> DAY ONE : Take a look around <p> Even after checking into your hotel , motel or guest house , you should have time to see the French Quarter in the two best ways : on a narrated carriage ride and on foot . <p> The carriage drivers pretty much follow the same route and have a similar spiel . <p> The half-hour ride was strictly historic notes found in guidebooks . Still , having someone besides their parents relate history seemed acceptable to the children . <p> The majority of the mule carriages cluster at the Mississippi River Side of Jackson Square , the French Quarter 's landmark that vies with the monstrous Superdome as the dominant feature on souvenir snow globes . The square 's broad sidewalks have been taken over by artists waiting to do portraits in charcoal or pastels , by tarot-card readers and mimes . <p> Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett , whose instrument is 26 goblets that he " plays " by running fingertips around their rims . Bennett refers to himself as " a glass harmonicist and pursed-lip whistler " ( with recording credits ) . <p> He told us , " Fifty years ago , I got into trouble during Sunday dinner doing this . " Then , at my son Michael 's request , Bennett rendered a version of the theme from " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . " <p> A must in Jackson Square is a stop at Angelo Brocato 's sweet shop for an Italian ice , a gelato , cookies or cannoli . They 're all made here , and they taste superb . <p> If you have time before dinner , head for the French Market , a combination produce and flea market of five short blocks between the French Quarter and the levee on the Mississippi . Perfect for kids ' souvenir hunting . <p> DAY TWO : New Orleans ' <p> institutional wildlife <p> If you are staying in one of the thousands of overpriced hotels in the French Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ladies in Red , the authentic Riverfront streetcars , for a ride to the Aquarium of the Americas . <p> Use one of the discount passes found in the hotel throwaway books to buy a combination ticket to the aquarium , the John J. Audubon ship and the Audubon Zoo . <p> The aquarium has five areas : <p> The Caribbean Reef , with a walk-through acrylic tunnel . <p> The Amazon Rainforest  --  yes , there are piranha and a pair of endangered hyacinth macaws . <p> Living in Water , which teaches how marine life adapts . <p> The Mississippi River , with monster catfish and the famed white alligator . <p> Gulf of Mexico . This 400,000-gallon tank contains support columns of a mock oil-drilling rig . <p> Outside , the three-deck riverboat John J. Audubon boards four times a day in front of the aquarium for the placid trip to the zoo . <p> The ship docks a few minutes ' walk from the back door of the zoo . Visitors may get either of two maps . Try for one of the pale orange maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened in March . <p> Audubon Zoo has all the things you expect of a good zoo : exotic critters such as koala , white alligators in a neat swamp setting and a white tiger . It also has such rarities as rhinoceros , kangaroo , cheetah and huge land tortoises . <p> While the aquarium corridors check children 's movements , the zoo opens up the great outdoors to them and lets them roam . <p> A free van shuttles zoo-goers to a stop on the famed St. Charles streetcar line , for miles-long , clickety-clack ride back to the French Quarter or the big convention hotels on its fringe . For adults , the nostalgic pleasure of riding the streetcar is tinged with envy as it passes old-money mansions and stately homes lining St. Charles . <p> DAY THREE : What 's all this about " Mardi Gras " ? <p> In case your sophisticated kids think that so far , New Orleans is just variations on a big-city theme , play your trump card : Today , you go to Blaine Kern 's . <p> Mardi Gras ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the prelenten festivities known as Carnival , which begins Jan. 6 . In New Orleans , the last 10-14 days before that Tuesday are the time of greatest revelry  --  and the famed parades through the French Quarter and in neighboring towns . <p> Most of the floats and huge , comic heads worn by marchers are made in the several warehouse of Blaine Kern 's Mardi Gras World . <p> If you let your imagination run free , this visit is a chance to have hallucinatory daydreams . Everyone is invited to try on bits and pieces of fancy costumes before they watch a narrated , videotape history of the parades . <p> Other fiberglass or papier-mache creations have been cannibalized  --  last year 's Joker yielded to this year 's Creature from the Black Lagoon , and Ronald Reagan became the Terminator . <p> Some characters hang from the ceiling , limbs or heads missing but bodies kept to be used as molds . <p> Yet , they all stand still , waiting for those few days each year when the celebrated Krewes bring them to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ferry for the five-minute ride across the river and an afternoon at the remarkaable Louisiana Children 's Museum . It 's just two blocks off the Magazine Street shuttle route ( remember that VisiTour pass ) . <p> Educational in intent but fun by design , the museum is two stories of hands-on experiments and new ideas . Teenage guides jump right in with the visitors , explaining and helping them work experiments . <p> If you have time and energy left , take the shuttle back to Canal Street and wander through Canal Place , an upscale , multi-story , shopping mall next to the river . <p> DAY FOUR : The Great <p> Outdoors  --  and indoors , too <p> New Orleans is on the edge of bayous and swamps that are home to the kind of creatures we usually see only in the zoo  --  or aquarium . But you can pay a few bucks and travel in small boats to see the animals in their wetland homes . <p> A number of companies offer swamp tours . <p> I opted for Dr. Wagner 's Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French Quarter . Our guide , Brian Mueschen , said he grew up not far from the swamp and learned to swim and water-ski in the West Pearl River , which we were touring . <p> Hueschen told his full boat ( 14 passengers ) the names and habits of owls , ducks , egrets and other wading birds he spotted . <p> We saw an uncomfortably large number of banded water snakes coiled along branches , warming themselves . <p> There also was an alligator that Hueschen estimated at 14 feet . <p> Back to the city and a chance to walk through the French Quarter . Its narrow streets are lined with shops selling everything from enormous crystal chandeliers to obscenity-laden T-shirts . But with a little adult supervision , children can window-shop . <p> Within the French Quarter are museums that hold some appeal for children . The former U.S. Mint now houses displays dealing with Mardi Gras costumes and the history of jazz . In the courtyard behind it is the Streetcar Named Desire  --  actually a trolley destination when Tennessee Williams was inspired to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested <p> For a taste of something more traditional , the New Orleans Museum of Art will satisfy children and adults . And the 1,500-acre City Park offers a kiddie train trip , carousel , paddleboats , amusement park rides and bikes to rent . <p> Those wanting a narrated tour of the busy port can board one of the several mock paddleboats . The ship most often recommended is the large Natchez . <p> For older children there are free tours on various historic themes led by National Park Service rangers . There also are tours of the Superdome and " haunted houses . " <p> Pretty touristy but fun for some are the free " Cajun dance lessons " each night at Michaul 's restaurant , 840 St. Charles . <p> Otherwise , not much is available for children at night in New Orleans , but you can plan your trip to coincide with festivals or parades . My wife and sons were delighted standing curbside two nights in a row for the big St. Patrick 's Day and St. Joseph 's parades in mid-March , which featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys came home loaded with bead necklaces , medallions and plenty of memories from a city full of good times , for adults and kids . <p> Robert Jenkins is the St. Petersburg Times travel editor .
