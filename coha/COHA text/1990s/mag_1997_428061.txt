Section : Washing Machines Test Front-loading washers are better for the environment , but are they worth the extra cost ? <p> Most Americans associate front-loading washing machines only with the Laundromat . That could change soon . More front-loaders for the home are hitting the market , in anticipation of Federal regulations requiring washing machines to use less energy . <p> The new washers promise to reduce the environmental impact of laundry day . Since they fill with water only partially ( the inner tub spins on its side like a dryer , plunging the clothes in and out of a small pool of suds ) , front-loading washers use less hot water  --  and hence less energy  --  than top-loading machines . ( Because front-loaders relieve electrical demand , some utilities , mostly in the West , are offering rebates of $50 to $250 to customers who buy the machines . ) Also , most front-loading washers fit where no full-sized top-loader will go  --  under a counter , for example , or stacked below a clothes dryer . <p> But these pluses come at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the full-sized Frigidaire FWT445GE and compact Asko 8005 , cost $800 and $900 respectively . Other front-loaders , including the Amana and Maytag models expected in stores this summer , are similarly expensive . What 's more , to get the best results with front-loaders , you need to use special detergent that can be expensive ( see " Pricey Suds , " page 49 ) . And little is yet known about their reliability . <p> Many of the 16 top-loading washers we tested washed clothes as ably as the front-loaders , and they cost $300 or $400 less to buy . Performance compared <p> Washing . Made to wash a colored load on the heaviest cycle , the machines all did a very good or excellent job in about the same time  --  45 to 50 minutes . Manufacturers maintain that because front-loaders do n't have a central agitator , they 're more gentle on clothes . However , our spot checks of wear and tear did n't verify that claim . Another supposed advantage of front-loaders  --  that their high spin speed dries clothes better  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose loads were as wet at the end of the cycle as those from top-loaders . <p> Capacity . As the photo on page 51 shows , the models with the largest capacities could wash at least a dozen more items per load than the smallest full-sized models . ( The compact Asko held only about half as many clothes as the best full-sized machines . ) <p> Efficiency . The two front-loaders excelled because they use hot water a lot more frugally than any top-loader . Given average water and electrical rates anti typical usage ( six large loads a week ) , the utility costs to run the Frigidaire front-loader would be about $35 lower per year than those for the Kenmore ( Sears ) 2693 , the top-rated top-loader . Given high rates for electricity , water , or both , the gap could be far wider  --  up to $100 a year . Recommendations <p> Front-loading washing machines  --  including the excellent Frigidaire FWT445GE , $800  --  are the washers to choose if energy conservation is a priority for you . However , unless you live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a top-loading washer is likely to be less expensive overall than a front-loading model . <p> The best top-loaders we tested  --  the Kenmore ( Sears ) 2693 , $600 ; GE WPSQ3120T6 , $510 ; Kenmore ( Sears ) 2683 , $500 ; and GE WWSR3090T6 , $480  --  are excellent at washing , ample in capacity , and relatively modest in water consumption . The repair record for the Kenmore brand , slightly better than that of GE , may make its models ( which are found at Sears stores ) worthy of first consideration . If you 're placing the washer in or near a living area , you might want to choose the Kenmore ( Sears ) 2693 or GE WPSQ3120T6 , which ( along with the front-loading Frigidaire ) are the quietest washers we tested . <p> The other washers that rated 2 overall are also worth considering , as are two fine GE models included in our last report ( July 1996 ) that remain in stores : the WPSQ4160T , $500 , and WJSR2080T , a good value at $400 . Be wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratings . As the repair history on the next page shows , many brands whose machines were mediocre performers in our tests have been among the least reliable over the years . If you choose such a machine , the money you save  --  and more  --  could be wiped out by a single repair bill . <p> Our Ratings include no models from Roper , a brand with a small market share whose spartan washers have been among the most reliable of those included in the repair history . Ratings &; Recommendations Washing machines Shopping strategy <p> Buy a machine by capacity , features , efficiency , reliability , and , if the washer will be located near a living area , noise . <p> Know the choices The washers in most houses are full-sized models ; compact models designed for apartments typically can sit in a closet or cabinet and be rolled to a sink . Most washers load from the top . Most front-loaders can sit alone , under a counter , or beneath a dryer . <p> Decide what to spend The $800 or more you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its excellent energy- and water-efficiency and , in some areas , by a rebate from the utility company . Top-loaders start at about $400 ; paying $450 or more often buys quieter , more efficient operation and a few additional features . <p> Know what 's in stores The best-sellers are Kenmore ( sold only at Sears stores ) , Whirlpool , Maytag , and GE . <p> Using the Ratings Basic components and basic performance may be very similar across certain washers within a brand or a " brand family " ( a collection of brands that may use the same manufacturer ) , as shown at right in the Details on the models . Overall Ratings : Within types , listed in order of overall score <p> Ratings &; Recommendations : Washing machines TABLE The tests behind the Ratings <p> Overall score is based primarily on washing performance , with capacity , energy efficiency , and noise also considered . Washing measures how well a machine cleans soiled swatches in a standard load . Capacity reflects how large a load the washer can effectively circulate . ( See photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water the washer uses per pound of laundry washed . Energy efficiency considers the machine 's electrical consumption and the energy required to heat the water for a warm wash , averaging the costs for electric and gas water-heating . At the maximum water setting , the most efficient washer will cost about 5 cents per load using an electric water heater and 2 cents using gas . The least efficient will cost 16 cents and 5 cents , respectively . <p> In the Details on the models , comparable models are listed together , the higher-rated model first . Dimensions are HxWxD , rounded up to the nearest inch . Water used is for the machines ' maximum load at the maximum water setting . Price is approximate retail . <p> Most models have * One-year parts-and-labor warranty ( many models also have longer parts-only warranties for the drivetrain or tub ) * Continuously variable water-level control . * Water hose for attachment to water-supply lines . * Lid that opens back . * At least two agitation and spin speeds , and at least three speed combinations . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Lip on top to contain minor spills .

Recommendation : A good , if spartan , machine from one of the less-reliable brands of top-loading washer . Repair history : Top-loaders <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1996 that have ever been repaired ; data have been standardized to eliminate differences solely due to age and usage . Differences of less than 3 percentage points are n't meaningful . A brand 's repair history includes many models , some of which may have been more reliable than others . Nonetheless , you should improve your chances of getting a trouble-free washer if you buy a brand that has been reliable in the past . <p> GRAPH : Overall score <p> GRAPH : Top loaders Data are based on 141,000 responses to our 1996 Annual Questionnaire . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A move to the front <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kenmore 2693 , $600 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fully loaded Some washers claim to hold as much as 22 pounds of laundry . Our tests measured what they can wash effectively . Models with 3 capacity handled 11 pounds of our mixed laundry ( left ) . Those that scored 1 held an additional 4 pounds or so ( right ) . ( We chose to score capacity for the machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the load . ) <p> KEY FEATURES WASHERS ' FINE POINTS <p> Key numbers  --  for example , ( 1 )  --  will help you locate models in the Ratings , page 50 . <p> Noise level Counts most if the machine will be near a living area . Compared to top-loaders , front-loaders are generally quieter during filling and washing and a bit noisier during the spin cycle . Of the washers tested The Frigidaire ( 1 ) , Kenmore ( 3 ) , and GE ( 4 ) are quietest . <p> Automatic lock during spin cycle Keeps children from opening the lid or door at the time when they 're most likely to be hurt by the machine . Of the washers tested The White-Westinghouse ( 15 ) and Frigidaire ( 18 ) have a lock . The door on the Frigidaire ( 1 ) and Asko ( 2 ) locks for the entire wash cycle ( though both machines can be opened  --  with difficulty , for the Asko  --  providing you turn the washer off first ) . <p> Rust-proof tub Most washers have a porcelain-coated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipped or the water is left in too long . Stainless-steel or plastic tubs wo n't rust . Of the washers tested The Frigidaire ( 1 ) , Asko ( 2 ) , and Amana ( 9 ) have a stainless-steel tub ; GE models ( 4,6 ) , Admiral ( 13 ) , Hotpoint ( 14 ) , White-Westinghouse ( 15 ) , Magic Chef ( 16 ) , and Frigidaire ( 18 ) have a plastic tub . <p> Porcelain top and lid Porcelain resists scratching better than paint . Of the washers tested The Kenmore ( 3,5 ) , and May-tags ( 8,11 ) have a porcelain top and lid . <p> Convenient controls Look for dials and buttons that are legible , easy to push or turn , and logically arranged . A plus : cycle-indicator lights or signals . Of the washers tested The controls on the Kenmores ( 3,5 ) are the most logical and legible ( see photo below left ) . Also , the controls on the Whirlpool ( 12 ) are color-coordinated ( see photo below ) for easy use . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the controls are in front and fairly low . <p> Continuously variable water-level control If you often wash partial loads , this lets you fine-tune the water level to the load . Of the washers tested All but the GE ( 6 ) , KitchenAid ( 10 ) , Whirlpool ( 12 ) , and Hotpoint ( 14 ) have this feature  --  or have five water levels , which is practically as good . <p> Automatic water-temperature control Adjusts water valves to achieve the optimal warm-water temperature of about 100 degrees F. Most washers mix cold and hot water in preset amounts , which can lead to cooler-than-desired wash water . Of the washers tested The Kenmores ( 3,5 ) have this feature , but the water may not reach 100 degrees if the cold-water supply is below 50 degrees . <p> Lots of settings The more wash-and-spin combinations offered , the easier it is to tailor the wash action to the clothes . Options that let you  --  rather than the machine-choose the combinations are more versatile for special loads . Of the washers tested One Kenmore ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) , Hotpoint ( 14 ) , White-Westinghouse ( 15 ) , Magic Chef ( 16 ) , and Frigidaire ( 18 ) have four . <p> Access for servicing Easy access to key components can be crucial . Of the washers tested The two GEs ( 4,6 ) are the only models that do n't have to be moved to reach all key parts . The Kenmores ( 3,5 ) , Whirlpools ( 7,12 ) , and KitchenAid ( 10 ) provide easy access to all key components except the solenoid valves in back , which turn the water on and off . The Amana ( 9 ) and Speed Queen ( 17 ) require extensive work to get at key parts . <p> Dispensers Those for detergent and fabric softener automatically release powder or liquid at the optimum time . Bleach dispensers can prevent spattering or premature leakage . Of the washers tested The Frigidaire ( 1 ) , Asko ( 2 ) , Kenmore ( 3 ) , Admiral ( 13 ) , and Magic Chef ( 16 ) have an automatic detergent dispenser . A softener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is standard on others . All except the Asko ( 2 ) have a bleach dispenser . <p> Installation ease Two attributes are important here : Self-leveling rear legs , which are easier to level in a tight spot than screw-in legs , and modest space requirements behind for the water supply and drain hoses . Of the washers tested The Frigidaire ( 1 ) , Asko ( 2 ) , and Maytags ( 8,11 ) lack self-leveling rear legs . The Kenmores ( 3,5 ) , Whirlpools ( 7,12 ) , KitchenAid ( 10 ) , and GEs ( 4,6 ) need more than the standard 31/2 inches in back for hoses . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fine tuning We liked the logical , legible controls on the Kenmore ( 3 ) ; those on its brandmate ( 5 ) are similar . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Color coordination The Whirlpool ( 12 ) uses color to help match water temperature and clothing type with the preferred cycle . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Special dispensation Detergent , bleach , and softener dispensers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DETERGENTS <p> Manufacturers recommend that front-loading washing machines be used with a low-sudsing detergent  --  usually one formulated especially for front-loaders . We concur with that recommendation . Both front-loaders we tested washed less effectively with a regular detergent that was identified as " low sudsing " than they did with liquid Wisk specifically made for front-loaders ( and sold only by mail ; call 800 335-WISK ) . Another detergent for front-loaders , Tide HE , is due in stores soon in both liquid and powder forms . The Wisk cost us about 45 cents a load  --  which is pricey , even as liquid detergents go . The Tide HE liquid will cost about the same . Tide HE will be less expensive as a powder  --  perhaps a few cents more per load than regular Tide Ultra . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Pricey suds <p>
