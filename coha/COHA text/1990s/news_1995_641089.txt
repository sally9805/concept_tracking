<p> Blacks are their own worst barrier to a better life <p> I write regarding Chet Whye 's diatribes against efforts to reform welfare and end affirmative action . Week after week , he accuses conservatives of wanting to take America back to the days of Jim Crow . I have to wonder if Whye harbors a certain nostalgia for those days himself . He writes as if the last 40 years have not happened . <p> In case Whye has not noticed , we have more government aid for minorities now than at any time in history . We have the world 's most generous welfare state , more aggressive affirmative-action programs than ever , more aid to education than ever , and a revolving-door criminal justice system . And yet , Whye persists in blaming conservatism and traditional white racism for the problems facing minorities . <p> The vile racism confronting minorities today can be found in the rhetoric of the civil rights establishment and of white liberals . It is the racism which says that blacks are mere passive victims of 400 years of oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blacks can not work their way out of poverty , can not compete in school , can not be held accountable for the crimes they commit and can not be responsible for the children they procreate . To imply that blacks can not help themselves is to imply that they are , in fact , inferior to whites . <p> The rapid growth of the black middle class proves that blacks are perfectly capable of accepting responsibility and overcoming adversity . When the traditional barriers to black opportunity came down in the 1960s , millions of blacks set about getting good educations , building good careers and raising strong families . This is a tribute both to these blacks and to America , which has done more than any other country on Earth to assimilate racial minorities . <p> Because we live in a country of more than a quarter billion people , we are bound to have a few scumbag white racists . However , far more damage is being done to the black community by blacks who subscribe to modern liberal attitudes . Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are voluntarily having sex with young unmarried men . It is the Crips and the Bloods , not the Ku Klux Klan , who are turning the cities into killing fields . <p> Thirty years ago , liberals had their finest hour when they knocked down traditional state-imposed barriers to black opportunity . Today they need to disabuse themselves of their fantasies about the new programs they have erected which have yielded such disastrous results . <p> DOUGLAS F. NEWMAN <p> Aurora <p> Union Park project revival a boon to state <p> Colorado citizens on both slopes should rejoice over the recent Colorado Supreme Court decision to revive Arapahoe County 's Union Park Water Storage Project . The state 's water future can be assured with this unprecedented high-altitude storage concept . <p> Union Park is a natural , sage-covered reservoir site on the Continental Divide . This off-river site will hold enough wet-cycle snowmelt to supply metro Denver during four years of serious drought . <p> However , Union Park is not just another Front Range water grab . About half of its 900,000 acre-feet of storage will be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought cycles . Stored water becomes liquid gold for wildlife , endangered fish , irrigated farms , cities , recreation and power generation in droughts . <p> Union Park also fits nicely with Governor Romer 's recent water-policy shift from deep wells to storage . The governor is urging Colorado to build drought protection and growth on its renewable surface waters - instead of mining finite ground water reserves . <p> About a million acre-feet , or a third of Colorado 's legal share of the Colorado River Compact , is now being lost during heavy snowmelt years to storage and growth in Arizona , California and Nevada . This tragic Colorado loss is worsening because of the long-term West Slope shift from irrigated farming to tourism . <p> In addition to drought protection for Colorado 's four major river environments , Union Park will substantially increase the safe yield of metro Denver 's existing reservoirs . <p> Instead of wasting another 10 years with legal infighting , Colorado citizens should unite to save their wasted waters in high-altitude storage . The stakes are high and urgent . Misguided federal programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> DAVE MILLER <p> PaLmer Lake <p> Story biased against candidate Crider <p> Please let this letter serve as a formal complaint about the factually incorrect and misleading reporting in the Feb. 27 story , " Crider publicity not what it seems , " on page 5B of The Denver Post . In short , outside of reporting factually that Bob Crider 's campaign received a $ 3,000 contribution from the Fraternal Order of Police , the story was egregiously biased against our candidate . <p> To begin with , the opening sentence of this article falsely implies that the Fraternal Order of Police 's press release was in fact a Bob Crider press release - despite the fact that it was clearly issued on Fraternal Order of Police letterhead . <p> Further , Chris Lopez indicated that the news event was held in the courtyard of the Police Administration Building as a deliberate ploy by this campaign to imply that Denver police officers , not sheriff 's officers , were endorsing the candidate . <p> It was the Fraternal Order of Police , not the Crider campaign , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , as you well know , Denver sheriff 's officers do not have a building named after themselves at which to hold an event of this nature . In large measure , sheriffs officers work out of the City Jail which shares the joint courtyard of the Police Administration Building - the site of the event . <p> Unfortunately , the story in question by Chris Lopez is not an isolated incident with regard to the Crider campaign . When Crider held a news conference in mid-February to unveil his written code of ethics , the story Lopez wrote detailed a wholly unrelated incident of alleged anti-Semitism that happened in the Auditor 's Office in 1991 . There was not one new piece of information in Lopez 's story that had not previously appeared in your publication surrounding the incident . We maintain that it was , in fact , a malicious effort to smear Bob Crider 's good name . Electing a new mayor is serious business . Citizens should expect the facts to be reported honestly and without bias . <p> CHRIS LINES , Campaign Manager <p> Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sports here ? <p> Be honest : if the CU men 's basketball team had won the Big Eight title three years in a row , what kind of coverage would that have gotten on the sports page ? A top-of-page headline and a picture at least . However , if the CU women 's basketball team wins the Big Eight title three years in a row , it rates the bottom of the page and no picture . Evidently , the winner of the Daytona 500 advertising a brand of film was more important to Post editors than a picture of Shelley Sheetz carrying the trophy in triumph . <p> CAROLYN and NORMAN GARD <p> Boulder <p> ' Too many judges ' ? Well , <p> why not step down <p> to ease the problem ? <p> Now comes the ultimate irony . U.S. District Court Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch is reported to have opined that " there are too many judges " in a speech before The City Club of Denver . Judge Matsch went on to blame lawmakers in Washington for continually widening court jurisdiction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps he should consider his own activist decisions as part of the problem . His propensity for social engineering as manifested by his two-decades-long jurisdiction over the Denver Public Schools is a case in point . Who does he think caused the failed policy of forced busing to achieve racial balance in the Denver Schools to be instituted , and who does he think paid for it ? <p> The irony is that I agree with him . There are too many judges , especially those of the activist bent . If he really means what he said , he should take the incredibly logical step of resigning now . Sadly , those trained in the law do not often think logically . <p> ALLEN HAMILTON <p> Denver <p> Leyba 's photos captured <p> physical demands and <p> excitement of wrestling <p> Please extend our congratulations to the photo and sports editors for the wonderful series of photographs by John Leyba , which so graphically captured the excitement and the physical demands of amateur wrestling ( Post , Feb. 19 ) . <p> I purposely include the editors in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often must spend hours taking picture after picture , only to see the final printed page with just one print - if he 's lucky. ! <p> With modern cameras and printing techniques , almost anyone can capture " a picture . " I believe John Leyba has shown what a true camera artisan can achieve . Let 's see lots more of his work soon , please . <p> HARRY L. HUTCHERSON <p> Estes Park
