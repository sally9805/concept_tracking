Ask Bill Gates , the founder and chairman of Microsoft , about something he wants to talk about-like a new software system or his upcoming railroad trip through China on Chairman Mao 's train  --  and he acts like the teenage boy that he still resembles . He grins . His voice breaks . He tucks his elbows into his lap and rocks back and forth as if to contain his excitement . But press Gates on a subject he does n't want to talk about-like the charges of anticompetitive , and possibly illegal , business practices that have been turning up lately , like ex-girlfriends at a wedding party  --  and he is liable to throw a tantrum . " I challenge your facts ! " he shouts when confronted with a new but relatively minor allegation . " That 's a lie ! I mean , it 's just not true . I never heard of any such thing . What a bunch of nonsense ! " <P> It is a curiously revealing moment . All the more so when a company spokesman concedes a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential competitors to tell the company their product plans before they would be allowed to participate in a Microsoft developers ' conference-is well documented . <P> Up until now , Gates has largely controlled the unfolding of his remarkable story . At 39 , he seems to have achieved the information age 's equivalent of the American Dream . Through intelligence , ruthlessness and hard work he dominates a technology so central to modern life that it touches nearly every office , school and desktop . He is very , very rich and so powerful that even his enemies are eager to cut deals with him . Now he wants more , a piece of all the action-the bills people pay , the phone calls they make , the news they read , the TV they watch . But he may have reached that point in the arc of his success where the very qualities that raised him high could start to drag him down . <P> If Gates is feeling a little cranky these days , he has good reason . The Justice Department just derailed his $2 billion bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal that would have helped realize Microsoft 's ambition to make money from almost every commercial transaction in cyberspace . Another team of government lawyers is snooping around asking questions about Microsoft Network , the new online service he plans to launch in August . And an antitrust suit that has been hanging over his head for nearly five years  --  and which he thought he had settled last summer  --  is in legal limbo , held hostage by an ornery federal judge . <P> Despite the company 's reputation as a juggernaut , Microsoft is running into some unexpected snags in the marketplace as well . Gates wants desperately to seize control of the so-called local area networks , where more and more corporate business is done . But the company is having trouble developing a product that can compete with Lotus Notes , which dominates the market for " groupware " ( the software that helps people brainstorm over these networks ) . Novell 's NetWare still controls two-thirds of the market for the software that runs the office systems , despite Microsoft 's best efforts with Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win customers from Oracle , which owns almost half the market for the critical database software that stores the corporate world 's most important information .
