<p> Michael Bailey , 35 , is the program director at Earthtrust , a non-profit wildlife-protection group based in Honolulu . A recent report by the U.N . secretary general to the General Assembly investigated the driftnetting situation and named Earthtrust as a key player in bringing much of the current information to the surface . Bailey was interviewed by USA TODAY 's Wendy Benedetto . USA TODAY : You 've fought against driftnets for years . What exactly is driftnetting ? <p> BAILEY : Driftnetting refers to large vessels that deploy a net up to 30 to 40 miles long . There 's a combined fleet of over 1,000 vessels around the world , which means a minimum of 30,000 to 40,000 miles of netting a night is deployed in the oceans . USA TODAY : You 're saying the nets kill at random ? <p> BAILEY : Driftnets are mainly targeted for squid , tuna , salmon , marlin and swordfish . But they take anything that can not swim through a 2-inch diameter mesh , which includes sea birds , whales , dolphins , seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these get caught ? <p> BAILEY : The present estimate of dolphins and whales killed every year numbers in the hundreds of thousands . The sea birds could number in the millions . The number of endangered species such as sea turtles is unknown , but it 's thought to be in the tens of thousands . USA TODAY : European Commissioner Manuel Marin will propose that driftnets be banned in European Community waters next month . Do you see this as a hopeful sign in your campaign to ban driftnet use worldwide ? <p> BAILEY : It 's a great step . Getting the European Community involved is truly an essential strengthening point in ensuring there is a global ban on high- seas driftnetting as the United Nations resolution calls for . USA TODAY : What 's in the resolution ? <p> BAILEY : The United Nations passed a unanimous resolution last December calling for a moratorium on driftnetting , which is supposed to go into effect in 1992 . The driftnetter nations - Japan , Korea and Taiwan - agreed to stop driftnetting in the South Pacific Ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> BAILEY : Exactly . There 's no enforcement body , whereas nations and the European parliament can embargo certain products . That 's why I 'm going to Europe - to promote the concept that regulations and laws need teeth . There should be embargoes against the fishermen 's products and the nations that violate driftnet agreements . USA TODAY : Congress recently passed a bill to control the use of driftnets in U.S. waters . What do you think about this action ? <p> BAILEY : It 's a small step , but a good step . It shows the other nations the USA wants to take a leadership profile . USA TODAY : Is this heightened awareness why many companies are saying their tuna is " dolphin-safe " ? <p> BAILEY : That 's the reason , because people are aware and concerned about the killing of dolphins by the tuna industry . USA TODAY : Environmentalists are skeptical . Why ? <p> BAILEY : There are no safeguards to ensure that what a company claims is dolphin-safe is dolphin-safe . We have a logo called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo licensed to tuna companies that meet the criteria for dolphin-safe . That requires inspection of their processing vessels and canneries and direct communication with the people who run the companies to ensure that the tuna is dolphin-safe . USA TODAY : Are consumers willing to pay more money for tuna from a company that protects dolphins ? <p> BAILEY : People will prefer to buy dolphin-safe tuna vs. tuna that they 're not sure is dolphin-safe . That was one of the reasons why Starkist announced it would be dolphin-safe . It had done some surveys and realized that the purchasing power of the public was such that having a dolphin-safe product was the way to go . USA TODAY : Are n't there other methods for catching tuna rather than driftnets ? <p> BAILEY : Basically , the methods being used now are the types that had been used before driftnets . One is the traditional method , hook-and-line fishing , bait-boat fishing . The dolphins , being much more intelligent than the tuna , see the hooks and do n't bite . There 's also a method called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd of tuna , which , if it 's done properly , is done without having any dolphins entrapped . Less than 10% of all the tuna taken in the world is taken by killing dolphins - either driftnetting or through other methods . USA TODAY : Is it cheaper for fishermen to use driftnets than the other methods ? <p> BAILEY : It depends where they 're fishing and what species they 're after . They use driftnets to catch more tuna quicker in some areas . It 's maybe 10% or 15% more effective than using hook and line . USA TODAY : Is that why there 's resistance ? <p> BAILEY : Exactly . And what we 're saying is that for the extra 10% of effort it takes to catch the same amount of tuna , let 's use methods that are dolphin- safe and thereby protect dolphins , whales , sea birds and other marine wildlife . USA TODAY : If it will cost fishermen more to fish without driftnets , will it cost consumers more ? <p> BAILEY : If a tuna company is respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying that product rises . It increases to the point where it actually does n't cost more because they 're having a higher volume of sales . USA TODAY : Where are driftnets being used now ? <p> BAILEY : Driftnets are used around the world . I recently received documented evidence that there are driftnetters operating as far as the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean . These are Asian-based driftnet fleets . We 've also received confirmation that they have been sighted in Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean and , of course , they were found throughout the North and South Pacific . USA TODAY : How long has this been going on ? <p> BAILEY : This form of technology has been going on for a little over 10 years . It started out as a small driftnet fishery for salmon in the North Pacific Ocean . These are Asian-based fleets , based in Japan , Korea and Taiwan . And as the technology increased to be able to create virtually thousands of miles of netting , the fleets expanded around the world . USA TODAY : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save animals ? <p> BAILEY : My personal motivation is a sense of accomplishment and purpose by working to protect , basically , life on Earth . My own life would be a terrible waste if I went through it without doing my utmost to try to ensure this planet had whales , dolphins and tigers still alive for future generations . That 's what motivates me . CUTLINE : Michael Bailey
