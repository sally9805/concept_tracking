As director of the CIA , R. James Woolsey must deal with a daunting array of sworn enemies : Russian spies , Libyan operatives , North Korean agents , Dennis DeConcini . . . Wait , Dennis DeConcini , the Democratic Senator from Arizona ? Listen to what he says and judge for yourself . " We have had a very obstinate director of the CIA who has hurt the agency , " says DeConcini , who is the chairman of the Senate 's Intelligence Committee . " He is not doing the Administration any good whatsoever and to me is a disaster . " <P> After 18 months in the job , Woolsey increasingly finds himself fighting a surprising new band of domestic foes : lawmakers and other espionage experts who feel that the nation 's spymaster has yet to prove he can retool U.S. intelligence for the post-cold war world . Woolsey is coming under growing attack for being too reluctant to cut his share of America 's $28 billion annual intelligence budget and too slow to bring diversity to the spy ranks . The spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 of the CIA 's female case officers have collectively accused the agency , under Woolsey and his predecessors , of denying them promotions and choice assignments . <P> In an interview with TIME last week , Woolsey vowed to shrink intelligence spending " prudently , " but complained that Congress has doubled the Administration 's proposed cuts , from $7 billion to $14 billion , through 1997 . During the 1990s , the cuts will slice 1 of every 4 positions from the U.S. intelligence payroll . " The intelligence community and the CIA will be  --  by the end of the decade  --  down to about the size it was in the Carter Administration , " Woolsey says . The man who ran the agency back then , however , does n't see that as a problem . " I do n't think we were shorthanded in my day , ' says Stansfield Turner , CIA chief under President Carter . " I think ( ( President ) ) Reagan and ( ( his CIA chief William ) ) Casey bloated it . " <P> Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels to look deep into the workings of the intelligence community . " This could lead to dramatic changes , " says a member of the President 's foreign intelligence advisory board , a group of White House appointees chaired by former Defense Secretary Les Aspin . President Clinton is expected to assign the 12-member panel in early August to evaluate the spy process from top to bottom . Yet that plan does n't please John Warner of Virginia , the senior G.O.P. member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , who wants an outside group for the task . <P> Key members of Congress feel that Woolsey is reluctant to embrace a changed world . DeConcini is angry at Woolsey for refusing , with White House backing , to accept the Senator 's legislation giving the FBI earlier access to possible security leaks . The measure comes in response to the case of CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames , in which the agency for two years neglected to inform the FBI of its suspicions after Ames gave deceptive answers in a 1991 polygraph exam . Ames , a 31-year CIA veteran , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to $2 million from Moscow for his spying .
