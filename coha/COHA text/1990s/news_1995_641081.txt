<p> Atomic bomb forestalled a bloody invasion of Japan <p> Your editorial , " Smithsonian exhibit showed ignorance of history , " ( Post , Feb. 2 ) is by far the best piece of writing I 've read on this subject . <p> My family to this day thanks Harry Truman for his life-saving decision . All the male members of my family were at great risk before the dropping of the atomic bombs . My brother had completed 67 missions over Europe as a tail and belly gunner in Army Air Force bombers . Shot down and wounded more than once in this most dangerous of jobs , suffering from battle fatigue and the nightmarish existence of four years of war , he was in the process of being reassigned to the Pacific Theater when we dropped the atomic bomb . <p> My father , over age and in questionable health , volunteered into the Army the day after Pearl Harbor . His job was physically demanding ; coupling that with worrying about his family , he was worn out by the time the war ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Theater , a crew member of a small , wooden- hulled , highly expendable minesweeper - the kind of ship that tried to clear the mines installed to prevent amphibious landings . You can be sure that this ship , its crew and I would not have survived an invasion of Japan . Most of the first-in landing ships and Army , Navy and Marine forces would have perished as well . <p> I do n't care about the numbers and statistics used by latter-day historians . I take it personally when they " bad mouth " the decisions made to prevent more deaths for Americans and Japanese in what would have been one hell of a battle . <p> GERHARD W. WINDSCHEFFEL <p> Grand Junction <p> Your editorial on the Smithsonian exhibit in the Feb. 2 Denver Post was right on the mark . <p> I had been seething about the exhibit ever since I read about it in a letter to the Air &; Space Magazine , a publication of the Air and Space Museum in the Smithsonian . <p> The creator of the exhibit was either ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore not suitable for the Smithsonian . Should that individual be earning taxpayer money ? Should he be cashiered out of the Smithsonian for incompetence ? If he were just ignorant , he could have read what Admiral ( former Harvard professor ) Samuel Eliot Morrison , the official historian of the Navy in World War II , wrote about the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima . <p> Or he could have interviewed veterans of the Pacific campaigns , some of whom , like me , were training to invade Japan and knew what they were going to get into in invading the Japanese homeland . It would have been at least as bad as , and probably much worse than , the Normandy invasion , the breakout , the Battle of the Bulge and others . <p> I am incensed that the exhibit was allowed to proceed as far as it did . And now the American people are deprived of knowing what really occurred . <p> Also I am incensed that the Japanese people are being lied to about what they did to the American people and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But in some eyes , this historian was just being politically correct . <p> JIM EDWARDS <p> Colorado Springs <p> Replacement players can put on a first-class show <p> Government has no right to involve itself in the baseball strike . It has more important things to do than helping a lot of greedy baseball players and owners make more money . Let the major league players keep on striking and whining about money . Fans will be more than happy to go watch replacements play . <p> Sports writer Jerry Crasnick ( Feb. 5 ) wrote that baseball will be a " second-rate product " if they let the " scabs " play . I think it will be a first class act , for at least the " scabs " will be playing for the love of baseball not the love of money . <p> GAIL SMALLWOOD-HEIDERSCHEIT <p> Lakewood <p> Hospice is alternative to physician-aided suicide <p> In the heated controversy over the " right to die " and physician-assisted suicide , which Dr. Jack Kevorkian has brought to global attention , one aspect seems consistently overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to die . We have the right to do so without suffering . The question is , do we let health care providers step in and speed up the process ? If we legalize this practice , the repercussions could be disastrous . <p> One of the most common reasons terminally ill patients opt to end their lives is as a way of ending their physical pain . <p> This seems absurd . We certainly do not lack the necessary technology or resources . The problem is that many doctors refuse to take the bold steps necessary to control severe pain in dying patients . <p> Another reason for choosing to die is that after suffering extended terminal illnesses , many patients begin to weigh heavily financially on their families . Some may choose to end their lives rather than place fiscal stress on their loved ones . <p> Health care in the inner cities is among the nation 's worst . It is quite likely that if the practice of physicians ending their patients ' lives became legal , the majority of those making this choice would be minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospice is an international model of care that ensures comfort for - and nurtures - the dying . Hospice cares for people regardless of ability to pay . <p> Over the years , hospice patients and care providers have discovered something that those who prematurely end their lives do not . The end of life can be one of the most rewarding parts of the human experience . <p> When pain is sufficiently managed and financial concerns diminished , the dying can make the last days a full and rewarding experience . Often , it is a time for family and friends to reunite and reconcile . <p> Although it has been proven since the 1960s to work amazingly well , it is an extremely underused resource in this country . Currently , hospices care for only about one- eighth of our nation 's terminally ill . <p> The right to die - comfortably - belongs to every human being , and it must be honored . Assisted suicide is not the only option . <p> LILA BYOCK <p> Missoula , Mont . <p> Readers rebut Dottie Lamm 's pro-choice views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , you told the story of Barbara Barton who , while pregnant with twins , put off treatment for leukemia so her children would have a chance to be born . She was diagnosed the same day she learned she was pregnant and , she and her husband , Jeff , decided against an abortion . Six months after the twins were born , Barbara died . <p> In a more prominent place you told the story of an unwed mother who , though humiliated and desolate , decided to bear her baby and give it to her minister and his wife who had suffered through the loss of three babies , one stillborn , one miscarriage and one who lived for a few days . <p> And then , on your editorial page , in contrast to the above mothers who give honor and esteem to their gender , you printed the words of Dottie Lamm who presents the sordid side of womanhood and unreason . <p> She pretends to be outraged when " five five people are murdered in the name of life " Teresa of Calcutta gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not teaching its people to love , but to use violence to get what they want And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child , how can we tell other people not to kill one another ? " <p> The false shock and the empty reasonings of Dottie Lamm provide a sharp contrast with the first two heroines written about in your paper . While Dottie Lamm speaks about a " potential life , " that can be expunged , the other women worthy of their name speak about a " potential death " which must be avoided . <p> I do not believe that Dottie Lamm speaks for the glory that is woman . <p> DAVID A. VILLECCO <p> Broomfield <p> On Feb. 5 Dottie Lamm implied that abortion can prevent future child abuse . I certainly agree that eliminating the birth of a child will doubtless keep that child from later damage , much in the same way that killing my cat today will end her chances of being run over by a truck tomorrow . I doubt that the majority of abuse victims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a victim , not because the parent was forced to bring a child into this world rather than abort a pregnancy . I can not offer statistics to support my suppositions ; but then , neither did Ms. Lamm . <p> My major concern is the erroneous belief of some " pro-choice " followers that we who adhere to a " pro-life " position are crazy , violent fanatics . <p> We abhor violence and are grieved at the hurtful actions of the extremists . We believe in a " Come , let us reason together " approach , for we are reasonable , intelligent people . <p> MARK VANDER STOEP <p> Westminster <p> Colorado makes history <p> by recognizing <p> rights of child <p> Hooray for The Denver Post for putting " Birth mom denied custody " on its front page Jan. 31 . Colorado has just made history by putting a child 's right to subsequent mental health before a biological parent 's right to " ownership . " <p> Yes , it 's sad that the birth mother did not have counseling . Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Yet , how fit is a mother who thinks that her child can wake up in a whole new home , taken from his mom and dad , and feel " safe " and " trusting " forever ? Justice Lohr 's dissenting statement " parents have a constitutional right to the care and custody of their children " is a ludicrous statement . <p> I would ask Lohr how he would feel , were he " kidnapped " from the family he lives with , and placed with a " new " family tomorrow . <p> Children in this state , in adoption disputes or foster care , go through the agony of " being kidnapped " and placed on " other planets of unfamiliarity " each day . <p> It is time we stop this " ownership " nonsense and base decisions about child placement upon a child 's early attachments and thus , the future healthy mental functioning of our citizens . <p> ADOREE BLAIR <p> Littleton <p> Your Jan. 31 , front-page headline ( Birth mom denied custody ) story raises many questions . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth mother " has visitation rights . " The foster mother was quoted as saying that she told the boy that " his birth mother loves him . " <p> Foster parent supporters claim that the natural mother is a " complete stranger " to the child . So , what has happened here ? Was the natural mother allowed visits with her son ? It appears that she was not , or she would n't be a " stranger " to him . <p> If she was not allowed visits , or other contact with him , then who prevented it ? If it was important that he know that his natural mother loves him , then why is she being kept from him ? <p> Adoption/child custody laws were not designed to separate children from loving , fit biological parents . Biological parents should not have to compete with unrelated people for the right to raise their children . Children are not trophies to be won or lost . <p> Placement of a child for adoption can be a loving choice , but it should never be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-month-old baby is not too old to be returned to his mother . <p> In fact , every year , infants and toddlers who are older than that are adopted , many of them from foreign countries . <p> K.M. KOTTMEIER <p> Colorado State Representative <p> American Adoption Congress <p> Parker <p> Help for teachers <p> in managing <p> discipline problems <p> Your article , " Discipline Learned on Job " on Jan. 30 accurately reflects the difficulty teachers face in their classroom . In fact , a critical study , " A Nation at Risk , " reports that over 50 percent of teachers ' classroom time can be spent on discipline . What you failed to mention was the possibility that all new teachers would learn productive discipline strategies in intensive classroom and conflict management classes instead of on the job . <p> We at the Colorado School Mediation Project have been teaching teachers the skills of managing conflicts productively in three to four day classes for over nine years . While many teachers know something about this topic , many also have n't had the intensive training that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and deal with their conflict in a productive , mutually respectful way . <p> I encourage anyone interested in furthering these skills in our schools to call both their own local school and university and request that classes in conflict resolution and mediation be taught to all new , incoming teachers . <p> You see , these skills benefit not only the teachers and students but also our own businesses who want future workers skilled in interpersonal communication and teamwork . <p> RANDY COMPTON <p> Boulder
