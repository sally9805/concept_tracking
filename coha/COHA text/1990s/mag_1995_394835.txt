Ever wonder what it 's like to own and use a large telescope ? Come along with me as I set up my homebuilt 25-inch f/5 reflector on the dark-sky site of the Texas Star Party . We 'll survey some wintertime nebulae and galaxies and get acquainted with the views through a 25-inch scope . ( Bring your long-johns , because even West Texas chills the spine early in the morning in January ! ) But before packing up , let me tell you a little about the instrument we 'll turn skyward tonight . For me , the easiest route to a great quality scope was to buy the optics and , with the assistance of a friend , build an open-tube scope with nicely finished wooden boxes for the primary and secondary/eyepiece holder sections that attach with long aluminum tubes . A black skirt fastens around the tubes , preventing stray light from entering the optical path during observing . The tube design allows me to carefully pack the optics in the two boxes in the cab of my pickup truck , while the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck 's cargo bed . I 've recently placed the scope in an observatory near Oklahoma City so my observing buddies can enjoy it frequently , but several times a year I still make the journey to the dark skies of Fort Davis , Texas , to share the views with friends in the area and to enjoy the ambiance of the Prude Ranch . Whatzzat ? Well , would you look at that . We 've pulled into the ranch just in time to set up before the prime observing hours roll by . Let 's pull the truck over into the lower observing field and assemble the scope . If you can unfold the star maps ( I normally use the Sky Atlas 2000.0 and Uranometria 2000.0 , by the way ) , we 'll be ready to plop in a low-power eyepiece and take a few stabs at some objects as our eyes begin to dark-adapt . The sky that hangs over us is that of the middle winter . It 's 10 p.m. , so we see Andromeda , Triangulum , and Fornax sinking in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellations Cancer , Hydra , and Leo rising over the mountains in the east . Because this is your first time out with the scope , I 've taken the liberty of drawing up an observing list of targets to view . Now that you 've adjusted to the dark , let 's catch the Fornax Dwarf Galaxy , a faint object that you could n't easily see in a smaller scope . Then we 'll engage the rich Milky Way of Monoceros and Orion by looking at the Rosette Nebula , the Cone Nebula , the Orion Nebula , M78 , and NGC 2022 . By early morning we 'll have seen an awful lot and can finish off with something different , perhaps the globular cluster NGC 2419 in Lynx and the galaxy NGC 2903 in Leo . The Fornax Dwarf appears as a faint glow in the center of my lowest power field . It 's a little cloud of stars in our Local Group of galaxies that was discovered only in 1938 , so it 's relatively amazing that backyard scopes , even big ones , show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster with only a few dozen dim stars scattered over an extremely faint , diffuse circle of light . By tapping the scope 's tube gently , you 'll see at least a faint glow in the correct position for this galaxy . The five globular star clusters orbiting this object are easier to spot than the galaxy itself , and that 's particularly true for NGC 1049 , a magnitude 12.6 fuzzy " star " spanning just 20 " . The other clusters , one to three magnitudes fainter , lie scattered in the same low-power field . They are ESO 356-08 , ESO 356-05 , ESO 3560-01 , and Hodge 1 . All appear as tiny , fuzzy glows not much larger than the foreground stars surrounding them . Stepping up to the Milky Way is easy by simply moving the scope and aiming its Telrad finder at the bright star cluster NGC 2244 in Monoceros . Peeking into the low-power eyepiece and carefully focusing will reveal the eerie greenish glow of the Rosette Nebula , a wreath-shaped gas cloud that is coalescing into the stars in the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant red color ) , the Rosette is difficult to see through a telescope . The culprit is low surface brightness , which makes little parts of the nebula appear dim . Feel free to move the scope around slowly to explore various parts of the Rosette . Its huge size of 80 ' by 60 ' means that only a portion of the glow fits in a single eyepiece field . A UHC nebula filter rests in the eyepiece , by the way , which permits seeing impressive detail in the nebula by cutting out skyglow while letting the light from the nebula pass through unimpeded . The northern edge appears sharply defined and several fields of overlapping bright and dark nebulae pop out on nights of good transparency , like this one . The nearby Cone Nebula , 5deg north-northeast , is somewhat more challenging . It 's a dark nebula in the shape of a cone whose outline appears courtesy of bright nebulae that surround it . A moderately high-power view ( 150x ) with the nebula filter reveals the wedge-shaped dark area that appears conelike in photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one . Well , okay , but do n't expect it to appear as it does in the color photos . We 'll divert to it for a brief look . Like the Cone , the Horsehead is a dark nebula visible because bright nebulae surround it , in this case the emission nebula IC 434 , a north-south ribbon of weakly glowing light . The Horsehead itself is rather small , measuring only 2 ' long , and pops out as a notch with an H-B filter , which helps to isolate dim emission nebulae , and relatively high power such as 200x . The head appears rounded on its southwestern side and slopes toward the horse 's nose . The horse 's neck widens as it blends into the dark cloud that extends eastward from the nebula . Several faint field stars lie just north of the nose . While we 're looking at nebulae in Orion , we ca n't pass the Orion Nebula , the brightest glowing gas cloud in the northern sky . The detail visible in the nebula as viewed with a large scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the vivid colors usually present in the photos of M42 in these pages . The two-pronged plan works best with M42 : sweeping at low power to soak up the full extent of the nebulosity , and examining smaller sections of the object at moderate magnifications . This lets you crawl through the nebula at your own pace and experience a dazzling variety of forms of glowing light . It 's almost like a universe in itself . Orion also houses three other detailed nebulae . Planetary nebula NGC 2022 is a smooth , bright glow surrounding its central star , a tiny little fellow exhausted of fuel and headed for the stellar graveyard . A real treat in the eyepiece , M78 is one of the most easily visible reflection nebulae . A gray-green glow with an irregular shape , this object has several faint stars inside it . It 's a dust cloud reflecting starlight to us rather than glowing on its own . Immediately east of the bright star Zeta Orionis , the emission nebula NGC 2024 glows like a fluorescent bulb and shows remarkable detail in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts across this object , separating it into irregular halves . It 's getting late , pal . If you 've finished gawking at the residents of Orion , we 'll move on to those spring-time objects now rising high in the sky . Stuck in the stark star group Lynx , the 10th-magnitude globular cluster NGC 2419 is a distant clump of several hundred thousand stars , at 300,000 light-years too distant to resolve . It looks like a bright , small core of light surrounded by a peppery haze , the unresolved light of nearly a million stars merging together over a wide gulf of space . Farther southeast , in the constellation Leo , lies an even more remote target . The spiral galaxy NGC 2903 shines magnificently through 20 million light-years of blackness . No , no  --  you keep looking , I 'll start packing up . See those spiral arms nicely defined and surrounding the core of the galaxy , which appears like a big fat star ? NGC 2903 is an Sb-type galaxy much like our own Milky Way , which soon will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece ? Thanks . No , keep looking . You 're getting a view that few people on Earth ever see firsthand . I 'm tired too , but keep looking . A 9th-magnitude sparkler , that one is . So you see how nice it is a to use a big scope ? That 's okay ; I 'll drive . Yeah , an awfully nice view . An awfully nice view .
