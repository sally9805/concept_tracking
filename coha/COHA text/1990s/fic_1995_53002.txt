Advertisements for our school appear in all the better magazines . <p> preHope is more than the name of our ship.Hope is the name of your dream.For your son.For yourself . And : <p> preThe Hope Pelagic SchoolGiving young men discipline , training and self-assurance.Giving their parents peace of mind . I have never known my own parents . Unlike most aboard Hope I was n't born with a silver spoon in my mouth , and did n't try to spit one out the first thing . The ads make me laugh when I run across them in Tutor 's library ; I 've learned not to mention thorn to the other boys , however . <p> It must be quite a shock to find a copy of Town &; Country or Sunset on your mother 's bedside table one afternoon , open to the back pages , with several such advertisements circled . <p> How long before you go ? Years ? <p> With me it was much different . No parents to worry over me  --  or plot how to rid themselves of me , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is paying for my schooling and why . <p> I do n't know and I do n't ask . I like it here and I 'm not about to mess things up with a lot of foolish questions . <p> One thing I do know is how to answer questions to please my teachers . Living in orphanages  --  while similar , I gather , to being sent away  --  develops a different mindset , from what I 've seen . I do better than most of the better-schooled boys simply because I have a motivation to do so . It upsets them , and I 'm ostracized to some degree , but I can take that . Why trade in a free cruise and good food for the luxury of acting spoiled ? I do n't fancy myself a Holden Caulfield . <p> The ability to concentrate my energy on any task I 'm given has made me a Class I boy . There are rewards , believe me . The top of Hope , with its broad roof covering the main deck , is where the Class I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should say less than forty . When time allows we sit in lazy groups on deck , discussing the classics , joking , enjoying the sun when we like , taking shade beneath the striped awning if the heat becomes too intense , and when our meals are served us . After the dark , cramped , and landlocked quarters at Oak Tree I ca n't complain . <p> Ignacio is another matter . He despairs . Ignacio is my only close friend here . He 's far more intelligent than I am , but he does n't apply himself . I think he wants to fail . That must be why Tutor made us roommates ; he hopes my behavior will rub off on Ignacio . I do nothing to dispel that belief , any more than I would break the superstitions of my classmates . For instance , the one against touching the fifty-foot circle in the center of our deck . <p> Our helicopter , which at other times is parked on the aft deck , lands on our circular pad with officials from whatever countries we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . I came on that helicopter three months ago on a blistering day . Class I boys wearing navy blazers and white slacks gathered before its rotor blades had stopped turning , shading their eyes to see who was inside . <p> They ignored me as I came down the steps , as most have ever since . Instead they craned their necks for anyone else aboard . I walked past them with my bags to get under the awning . When no one else got off , the boys looked at me . They saw nothing that interested them . My clothes were not fine . I do n't possess the bearing of their social stratum ; I do n't look strong or influential . <p> So they walked away . <p> All but Ignacio . He has a way of staring . He is small and wiry , not much of a threat in a physical way ; but his eyes are piercing . <p> " Are you my welcoming committee ? " I said , trying for a joke . <p> " Tutor will look after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " You do n't know ? " He seemed wary and tipped his red-topped head to one side in a quizzical way . <p> " No . " <p> " You must have met him . With your parents . " <p> I shook my head . <p> " You do n't sound Texan , " he said . <p> " I 'm not . " The ship was off the coast of Texas at the time . <p> " Going to school there , then ? " <p> " No , I flew down last night from Wisconsin . " <p> " You 're my new roommate . You came from an orphanage . " <p> " What ? How did you know that ? " <p> " I 'll go get Tutor . He 'll want to see you right away . " <p> " Wait a minute , " I said . But it was too late : he disappeared through a doorway and I was alone . Alone except for the helicopter pilot , though soon he left as well . His machine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I covered my ears and shut my eyes until the wind and noise had gone away . When I looked up the copter was just a speck receding toward the horizon . <p> Later , after I had met Tutor and Ignacio showed me our room , the helicopter came back . The other boys walked out to greet it again , while Ignacio took the deck chair beside mine . The copter disgorged a homogeneous group : men in suits , women in suits . They could barely contain their excitement at seeing the Class I boys . <p> " You do n't have to worry , since you 're new , " Ignacio said . " They wo n't question you . Or me either . " <p> " What are they here for ? " I said . <p> Ignacio looked amazed . " Were you born under a rock ? " he said . " This is a school . Those people are recruiters . What did you expect ? " <p> I shrugged and felt stupid . <p> " Well , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One will be from the accreditation committee , checking up on conditions . But you never know which . I 'll tell you what they will say , if you like . And what will happen . It 's always exactly the same . A little play we put on to amuse ourselves . " <p> I stared at him and he smiled the largest smile I have ever seen from him . He knew I did n't believe him . But in time I found he was right about the recruiters . First they ask the same basic questions . Are we well cared for ? Well fed ? What do we want to become when we reenter the " real " world ? <p> It might seem , hearing those questions repeated every week , we would answer them perfunctorily . But of course we knew better . " You must understand , " Tutor always says at breakfast the day they are to arrive . " To those people the questions are of the utmost importance . Please respect that , and answer accordingly . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals . <p> The second round of questions is just as predictable , though more difficult . Our visitors get eager , thirsty looks , and ask probing questions on languages , political science , the arts , computers , psychology , chemistry , physics , higher math . Our school has a strong reputation . They look , we know , for boys with certain qualities . Some represent technical schools ; some colleges ; some are from corporation looking for a prodigy in , say , computer science : a mind that , with proper training , will give their company the edge in research and development . Perhaps a mind that large does n't integrate well into so-called normal society ; if that is so , the best place to look is on a ship of misfits . I have heard rumors of other ships  --  some with boys , others only with girls . But I have : never seen one . <p> In any case , once satisfied , the recruiters make notes on their clipboards and prepare to leave . <p> Then the final round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , and probably from the accreditation committee ) asks if they can see other boys on other decks . Tutor smiles and says , " Yes , of course you can . But there are six more decks and three hundred boys to see . Do you have time for that ? " The woman will hesitate , watching Tutor closely . Suddenly he smiles broadly and says , " Come along then ! We have much to see and little time to . . . " <p> And here the helicopter pilot clears his throat . Tutor stops , dismayed . The pilot explains there will not be sufficient fuel to reach land safely if they stay aboard much longer . Because during the interviews Hope kept sailing toward its next port of call . . . <p> " She was very ' brave , while it lasted , " Ignacio says each time , sarcastically in my ear . " Of course , it is better not to know an unpleasant thing if there is the least chance one might be stuck with it , " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman , because I doubt his stories . Ignacio says he wanders the ship at night while the rest of us sleep , and has told me what he sees . Or claims to have seen . Below the dormitory levels are crews ' quarters ; this is well known . But also below decks , Ignacio says , is a sort of prison  --  he calls it The Seven Beds  --  where violent or subordinate children are caged like animals . <p> " If that 's true , " I once said , " why not study harder and get away ? " <p> His answer was not very convincing : " No , my only chance to get away is not to study . " That made no sense , so I put it out of my mind . <p> Tutor has given us our assignments . Mine is to write a five-thousand-word essay on the role of education in " primitive " versus " advanced " societies . Ignacio 's assignment is a survey paper on techniques of value in training the incorrigible in an institutionalized setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning has been a total waste . <p> Our main library is small , and often too crowded with other boys for good studying . But Tutor has been good to us  --  to Ignacio and me . He lets us use his private office . It has more books than I have ever seen , and a marvelous view from its huge curving window . We have spread our periodicals on his heavy oak desk . But the viewpast the bow , where waves shudder and fall into clouds of spray as our ship sails westward , distracts us from our work . <p> A further distraction is the nonacademic magazines Tutor has . When alone , we pour over the advertisements , seeking familiar faces . Initially I found the small back-page ads the most interesting : Relax at Paradise Island Resort ; Sherpa Guides Offer Adventure ! ; Take the Orient Express to Lake Baikal . <p> Then one day I saw Ignacio staring at the photo of a woman in an ad for perfume . His pupils expanded and contracted as his eyes flitted over the photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair and green eyes of the woman , each emphasized by her blazing white dress . After several minutes I shook him by one shoulder and asked what he was doing . <p> " Searching for my mother , " he said , without taking his eyes from the picture . <p> I ignored that comment at the time . But since , seeing him lapse into trances on several occasions , I too began to search the glossy ads . I look for that combination of triangular chin , aquiline nose , blue eyes , and smooth , pale forehead topped by dark hair to match my own . <p> Ignacio 's interest in features and colors quickly became my own ; because of that , I suddenly saw Tutor as a colored man . Before he had been only . . . Tutor . His features were African , but his skin tone  --  even his hair tone  --  was an orangy red . He looked as though someone had sprinkled him all over with ground paprika . Yet Ignacio never seemed willing to turn his curiosity loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would he have seen the resemblance I did between the two of them ? Indeed , their features were so similar , they could have been father and son . The only clear differences were age , size , and Ignacio 's caramel skin . And their eyes , of course . While Tutor 's eyes were chocolate brown , Ignacio 's were a ghostly green . <p> In midafternoon I felt a presence behind us . It was Tutor . When I turned he smiled and came to our desk , the leather soles of his alligator shoes and the rubber tip of his cane creaking as everything does aboard ship . He wore , as always in warm seas , an impeccable white linen suit and a black bow tie . The splotchy red freckles on his face were supplemented by a dappled light that penetrated the weave of his wide straw hat . I assumed he had just been on deck . <p> " How are your papers coming my sons ? " he said , doffing his hat . He often referred to the boys on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my sons . " We , as often , called him " Father . " <p> " Fine , sir , " I said . This was in no way true . I had spent the whole morning as had Ignacio , paging through a stack of magazines , seeking clues to my past . But Tutor took me at my word and turned to my somber friend . <p> " Ignacio ? Are you making progress ? " <p> When Ignacio looked up at Tutor , his face was streaked with tears . This caused such a look to come over Tutor I felt ashamed to see them , and quickly looked out the picture window . <p> As I concentrated on the waves crashing against the bow , I heard a small broken version of Ignacio 's voice ask : " Father ? Will this be the year that I can leave ? " <p> Tutor said , " Come with me ! " in a tone that made me jump involuntarily . But there was something in his voice besides anger . Utter sadness ? <p> Ignacio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they left me in Tutor 's cabin looking out to sea . <p> An hour before sunset we acquired six more boys . These came by launch , from a gleaming harbor city half hidden by a range of coastal mountains . <p> A dozen of us stood at the rail of the upper deck . Amesbury , a tall blond with a stout neck , whose jacket always seemed too small on him , said something nobody could make out . His voice was that deep : if he did n't yell you could n't understand him . Somebody told him to repeat it . <p> " Portuguese . I said Portuguese . " <p> " Good lord , Amesbury , you ca n't even see them yet , " Takemura said , in a purposely bad imitation of snobby English . " You may have caught their odor , however , with that fine , skyscraping nose of yours . " <p> Amesbury mumbled something that ended with " stupid slant . " <p> We all straightened up quickly when Tutor tapped the railing twice with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had Ignacio with him . My smile had no effect on either of them , so I turned my attention to the launch . <p> Two men aboard her pitched lines that seemed to hang in the air , reluctant to reach us . Yet our crewmen caught them , and tied them securely on deck . The launch raced her engines , churning the water to keep a safe distance away . <p> " Look at those striped shirts , " Takemura said in a stage whisper . " Portuguese . Definitely , positively , Portuguese . " <p> The short boy with glasses standing between us  --  I think his name is Danvers  --  said , " Shut up , all right ? " <p> " Yes , sir ! " Takemura said , raising a mock salute . <p> Our crew activated a small crane , lowering a platform to the deck of the launch ; there it was piled with boxes , and hoisted back aboard our ship . <p> Ignacio came up and bumped me . He nodded toward the launch and I noticed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the crying boy with a mix of fear and embarrassment , and for a moment no one moved , as though posing for a portrait painter . <p> " You wo n't see those six on the top deck anytime soon , " Ignacio said quietly . " They 'll go straight to the lower decks . " <p> " Well , what of it ? " I said . " If they lack the right education , they 'll have to work their way up to Class I. " <p> " No , look at their clothes  --  they 're rags . I mean they 'll go to the lowest decks , the ones you do n't believe in . " <p> " That 's right . I do n't believe it . Why waste space on boys you can never teach ? " <p> " They 're paid to take them . " <p> " It ca n't be that simple . " <p> " Let me put it this way : if they did n't take them , the recruiters would n't be sent aboard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation . No reputation. , no Hope . " <p> " Who are they , then ? " <p> " Dissidents . Troublemakers . Whoever they are , they 're wanted out of the local prisons . " <p> " I do n't believe it . " <p> " That 's up to you . " <p> The crane 's platform was lowered again , empty . Suddenly a rough looking man came forward . He barked an order at the boys , but the sound of waves and the distance kept me from hearing what he said . Slowly , showing no emotion , the boys stepped onto the platform and were hauled skyward . <p> Already our crew was untying the launch , edging it out to sea with long poles . Before it had made much headway , a chorus of high-pitched yells turned my attention to our stern . Apparently the crane 's mechanism had frozen . There were the boys , swaying eight feet above our aft deck , clutching at the platform 's rigging . To get down , all six were compelled to leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a long jump ; one turned his ankle badly . <p> " Christ , I think he broke it , " Takemura said . <p> " No way , " Danvers replied . The crane operator hopped down and two other crewmen ran to help . <p> " That 's one less to worry about , " Ignacio said , so only I could hear it . <p> " What do you mean by that ? " I said . <p> " Why nothing , good and trusting sir . " Ignacio had pulled his eyes into a hideous imitation of Takemura doing his imitation of Amesbury . Now he stuck out his teeth . " You no believe me nohow . " <p> " Cut it out , " I said . <p> " So sorry ! " <p> At sunrise we awoke and put on our gym clothes . <p> Each morning before breakfast the Class I boys march down to the aft deck for calisthenics . These workouts have been my favorite ritual here ; they were my least favorite at the orphanage . When Tutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose he thought it signaled a positive change in me  --  I 'd been rather gloomy ashore . But in truth I simply found exercise less strenuous in the open air , with dashes of salt spray cooling my back , than I had in the stuffy , dark gymnasium at Oak Tree . <p> Ignacio caught up with me on the first landing . <p> " How are you feeling today ? " he said . <p> I had n't expected him to talk to me after yesterday . " I 'm fine , " I said . " How are you ? " <p> " All right . " <p> Takemura and two other boys passed us on the stairs . Takemura held his hands up like puppets facing each other . " And how are you today ? " one of Takemura 's hands said . " I 'm fine ; and how are you ? " said the other . He dropped his hands . " ' Really , gentlemen . Such scintillating conversation so early in the morning may damage your brains . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taketours and his giggling friends go ahead . It was nice to be with my friend and not worry about things  --  just enjoy the weather and the open spaces . The early light turned the sea , the ship , and our faces a deep red ; the light breeze and the sun 's warmth felt wonderful . <p> We said nothing for some time , and I noticed Ignacio was looking at the fantail of the ship . The sunlight tinged its surface the color of blood , and a party of boys was running mops over the metal deck in preparation for our arrival . <p> " What are you looking at ? " I said . <p> " Nothing . We 'd better go down . " <p> We rounded two more landings . Ignacio kept trying to look past a taller boy who walked ahead of us ; I stood on tiptoes , seeing nothing but seven boys pushing mops . <p> " No ballet practice until evening , I 'm afraid , Sarmington , " Tutor said to me . He was bringing the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought it was funny , too , but Ignacio did n't . His face looked pinched , as though he was about to cry . <p> " What 's wrong ? " I said . <p> " Shut up . " <p> " What ? Why ? " <p> " Let them pass . Let them get past . " He gabbed my elbow and pulled me to the railing . <p> " Is anything wrong ? " Tutor said . <p> " I 'm not sure , " I said . " Ignacio ? " <p> " I 'm feeling ill . " <p> " You boys go about your business , " Tutor said . Those behind him shuffled down the stairs , glancing at us . Then he said to Ignacio , " Should I call the doctor ? " <p> " No . I 'll be all right . Just cramps . Sarmington can take me back up . " <p> " You do n't mind ? " Tutor said . " Not at all . " <p> " Call for me if he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . " <p> Tutor went below with the others and I helped Ignacio up the stairs . " Are you feeling better ? " I said when he reached the next landing . <p> " Did n't you see it ? " <p> " See what ? " <p> He stood up and looked out past the stem . " That body in the water . " " You probably saw a shark , " I said . <p> " There was a shark , too . " <p> " They were probably both sharks  --  after the garbage those boys were pitching overboard . " <p> " No , one was a body . A body in a striped shirt . " <p> " Stop it , " I said . <p> " I saw the shark take him . It swirled , turned upside down and took him by the head . " <p> I closed my eyes and brought my hands up to my ears , but Ignacio caught them with his . " It 's not possible , " I said . " If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be overloaded in a month . " <p> " Not every country , or even the same ones every time . Six is unusual . Probably a coup attempt or purges . " <p> " Even so , we could n't keep them all . " <p> " We do n't . They go to other prisons in different countries . This ship is just the go-between . The idea is to get them out of the way , but without killing  --  without making them martyrs . They just disappear . " <p> " How do you know all this ? " When he did n't answer I shook my head . <p> " Come with me tonight , " he said . " Come belowdecks and I will prove it all to you . " <p> As we lay in our bunks , rocking slightly with the motion of the ship , I prayed that Ignacio would fall asleep and forget . My prayers were useless . Not knowing if he was asleep  --  or awake , waiting for me to make the first move  --  ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mattress , whispering his name into the dark below . There was no response . After several minutes I climbed out of bed and found Ignacio gone . <p> I dressed quietly and opened our door . Barefoot to keep from waking anyone , I stepped into the hall . At the end of our dorm I peered through the small square window into the lighted companionway . The night resident 's desk sat deserted . I slipped out and closed the door behind me . <p> There was not much choice of ways to go . I followed caged overhead bulbs along the metal corridor to the first landing . The stairs leading down were well lit and being seen on them was a real possibility . Though we have no guards on the upper decks  --  Class I boys are left to our own recognizance  --  I still might be seen by one patrolling the decks below . I quickly went down one open flight , then ducked into a hallway darker than the one above . <p> I hesitated . My palms began to sweat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , and seldom then . Of course I was trapped . I could n't just stay there . Every closed cabin door seemed to hide something I did n't want to see . I decided to go back to my own bed . Then suddenly that acute , prickly feeling of being watched drove up my spine . I had passed a dark , open doorway a few yards back . I turned around and saw Ignacio leaning in it . Or I thought I had , because when I rubbed my eyes the figure disappeared . <p> That decided it for me . I flew down the stairs and pulled up in the darkened corridor below . I turned away from the stairs so my eyes would become accustomed to the dark . As they did I saw another doorway yawning a deeper darkness than the rest of the hall . Ignacio stood in it , smiling at my attempt to be sneaky . <p> " Follow me if you want to see something " he said , and disappeared into the dark . I ran to the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to think : I started down the spiral stairs , halting now and then to catch the metallic ring of his feet below . <p> After a time in darkness I lost track of my senses . Distance was meaningless . Time had no reference point . I stopped but heard no steps ahead . How long had I been here ? And where was that ? I pushed my hands firmly against the walls of the stairwell and took sluggish steps , expecting to suddenly walk off the edge of the known world . <p> In so doing I stepped on Ignacio 's foot . I jumped back , but his hand took my shoulder in the dark . " You 're going to get us caught , making all that noise . Hold on to me and do n't step on my heels . " He folded my fingers into the hem of his shirt and we walked farther into the darkness . <p> The steps fell away under our feet and the air grew colder and clammier . Finally the fresh sea smell gave way to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my quarters at Oak Tree seem a paradise . A deep throbbing sound began and grew louder . I expected to find a low room filled with the languishing bodies of ragged boys , wrapped in a hazy darkness . I suppose the idea came from Ignacio 's stories and reading too many Dickens novels . <p> So suddenly dragged into the bright glow of the engine room , I had to shield my eyes . Ignacio squatted immediately behind a steel pillar , pulling me with him . The sound of pistons drummed in my ears like a monstrous heartbeat . <p> " Let go ! " Ignacio said . He pulled my hand from his shirt . Cupping his hands over my ear he said , " Guards across the room . Stay low . Head for that door . " <p> " What door ? " The shock of light and noise had been so great , I was only now coming to my senses . <p> " There . " <p> We made our way along the wall without being seen . Once through the door the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human excrement was almost too much . I wanted to turn back . Seeing this , Ignacio held me by one wrist . <p> " We 're almost there . " <p> I closed my eyes and let him lead me , feeling with my feet like I had on the stairs . I breathed through my mouth to lessen the stench . When he finally stopped I opened my eyes . <p> Straight out of Dickens . The room was low and dark . Human shapes lay on the floor and crouched against steel pillars . Someone coughed repeatedly . But it was n't a book . I wish it had been . <p> " Why are n't there guards here ? " I said . <p> " No need . Everyone is chained . But this is only the main room , " Ignacio said . " We came to see the other part , too , remember ? " <p> Hearing our voices , several boys looked at us . " Take me back up , " I said . " I 'm going to be sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one will notice . The Seven Beds is over there . " <p> He pointed across the room . <p> " I wo n't go in there . " <p> " Yes you will . " He started to pull me ahead , but I tore at his hand and ran the other way . I ran without thinking , back toward the light of the engine room , then back to the comfort of my room . <p> " So tell me , Sarmington . What did you make of your little excursion last night ? " Tutor did not seem upset , merely curious , as he settled back in the leather chair behind his desk . <p> I was too shocked to reply . I tried to check the sudden stampede of my breathing . <p> " Surely you did n't think you could traipse all over a ship of this size unobserved . " <p> " No one stopped us , and Ignacio said . . . " <p> " No one stopped you ? We are trying to teach you to be self-responsible adults . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taught to obey those rules . So do not say that no one stopped you . You were to have stopped yourself , my son . " <p> Those two words  --  " my son "  --  turned my stomach over . Somehow they had a sickening finality to them . <p> " You believe that punishment waits for you , do n't you , Sarmington ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " First let me tell you something pleasant . Ignacio will leave us soon . He has earned the right to go ashore , the one thing he has always wanted . I am proud of him . He has done well in his studies . " <p> I must have looked totally amazed , because Tutor 's voice speeded up suddenly . " Of course he made errors in the past . That is only to be expected . But he has overcome his limitations and will be rewarded accordingly . " <p> His voice became an intimate whisper : " His early mistakes were much like your own , Sarmington . " <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously . <p> " Punishment ? " he said in his normal voice . " There is no punishment here for you , Sarmington . You were brought here to fill a need , and now that Ignacio is leaving that need awaits . You are to take his place . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " Ignacio was my understudy , you might say , though he never wanted the job . It was his unless we found a more suitable candidate . You like the sea air , that is obvious . And you are ready to please , if at all possible . True , you strayed outside the rules , but you would have seen everything aboard eventually . Your willingness to follow Ignacio shows both loyalty and initiative . Those are qualities we highly prize . " <p> My hands gripped the arms of my chair . Suddenly this giant ship seemed a constricting collar around my neck . I breathed loudly through my nose , but Tutor went on . . . <p> " Of course , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many . Ignacio does not know it , but one day  --  before I die  --  I hope to join him on our southern estate . He . . . " <p> Tutor 's words continued hammering at me until I thought I would burst . I stared out the wide window at the barren ocean ahead of us : a gray wasteland of eternal unrest . . . <p> " Initially your functions may seem like punishment , Sarmington , but only if you resist them . You must learn every part of the ship , do every job . Tonight you sleep in your old berth , but tomorrow . . . " <p> I sprang from my chair and rushed to the door . It was locked of course , though I clawed at it like a wild animal . Tutor did nothing to stop me . When I finally faced him , he looked at me sadly and shook his head . <p> " I had so hoped it would n't come to this , Sarmington . I thought you showed such promise . But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tutor reached under his desk and I heard a bell chime faintly . In a moment I heard footsteps . <p> " You wanted to know your punishment . " The best I could do was nod jerkily . " You 've seen the boys who swab the decks ? " I nodded again . " Good . I assume you know where they reside . If you make it out of there alive we will talk again . " <p> I have slept in The Seven Beds  --  this prison , this death row  --  for forty nights . The smell no longer bothers me . I only know that  --  for tonight at least  --  I have hope : I can remember my name . That is how you tell if you 're still alive . <p> In forty days I have seen the bodies of nine boys fed to the sharks . I have also seen one boy released , so it can happen ! I believe that , no matter what , I will not be killed . I am needed here . <p> It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garbage is collected from throughout the ship , great quantities of it , bagged and dumped during the night into the room through a hole in the ceiling . We are quite literally the garbagemen . We must either throw it off the stem each morning or drown in our own refuse . The first time a body came wrapped in burlap , I screamed until a guard appeared and struck me unconscious with a length of iron pipe . Now bodies are bothersome only because they are heavy to move , compared to the other garbage . <p> I am determined to live . I am determined to see the light of day and live again on the top deck . We get little food here , so we break into certain bags that look promising . Occasionally I recognize scraps that could only come from the Class I menu . <p> Besides the food I search for intelligible writing from the upper decks . I preserve what I find in a small plastic bag I keep tied around my neck . <p> Each morning we are led upstairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heave the sacks and corpses overboard . I know he has seen the positive change in me . He smiles whenever I make a particularly good toss and look toward him for approval . He nods . Though I may feel tired , just that much recognition from him , just that little sign of encouragement , makes me surge with energy . I know my body is getting stronger under this regime of hard labor . I know from Tutor 's looks that I am improving my lot . It is only a matter of time and effort on my part before I return to the top deck . I know that . <p> Here is the last bag for today . I snatch it from the hands of another man , who gladly lets me take it . I look at Tutor . He is still smiling .

The white nose protrudes above the water , the mouth sweeps up smoothly , takes the bag and disappears with a swish of his tail . <p> I look back at Tutor . He is pleased . He waves ! I am almost in tears at this demonstration of confidence in me . He leaves the rail and heads upstairs , where I wish to go , and a guard approaches me , places a mop in my hand . <p> The Class I boys will be here soon for morning exercise .
