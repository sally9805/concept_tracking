<p> Cupid 's arrow nailed a bull's-eye last month for U.S. Archery Team members Jay Barrs and Janet Schaffer . The Olympic hopefuls were married April 22 in Tempe , Ariz . Barrs won a 1988 Olympic gold medal , and Schaffer was a silver medalist at the National Indoor Championships . Barrs and Schaffer did n't wed on the range , but they did get engaged at the 1994 U.S. Target Championships . Barrs announced his intentions before the crowd at the awards banquet . The couple lives in Salt Lake City . <p> BADMINTON <p> Feathers were ruffled on more than just the shuttlecocks in the World Badminton Championships in Lausanne , Switzerland . After China beat favored Indonesia in the team finals of the Sudirman Cup on Sunday , players from the two teams decided to continue the match with their fists . A scuffle broke out after Chinese fans threw flags down from the stands for their players to carry in a victory lap . One hit an Indonesian official , who threw the flag to the floor . The Chinese players apparently took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished 25th out of 49 teams . <p> BASEBALL <p> With tryouts for the ' 95 national team less than two weeks away , Baseball USA still has n't fleshed out its 40-man invitation list . One reason stems from the defection of two invitees - Clemson pitcher Billy Koch and Stanford pitcher Jason Middlebrook . Koch , a sophomore , declined to attend summer school ; Middlebrook is rehabbing an injured right elbow . Meanwhile , Long Beach State freshman right-hander Ricky Biddle and Dallas Baptist ( NAIA ) sophomore outfielder Scott Harp have accepted invitations , keeping the number of invitees at 37 . Organizers intend to reach the limit within the week . <p> BASKETBALL <p> The " Georgia Girls " made a mark for themselves at this week 's national trials for berths on the U.S. World University Games and Jones Cup teams at the Olympic Training Center . The Lady Bulldogs , coming off a Final Four appearance , were represented by guards Kedra Holland and Saudia Roundtree and center Tracy Henderson and La'Keisha Frett . " The best lesson they can take back with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how good you are , you have to play hard - all of the time . If you do n't do that here , you get embarrassed . " Tech guard Kisha Ford was also invited . " This is a tremendous opportunity for Kisha , " coach Agnus Berenato said , " because we are going to have to ride her next season . " <p> BEACH VOLLEYBALL <p> Holly McPeak and Nancy Reno are the hottest pair on the American women 's tour , winning two of the past four events . The duo started the season seeded seventh , but most likely will move to first at next week 's stop in San Diego . While McPeak dominates the back line , Reno , at 5-feet- 11 , is a force to be reckoned with at the net . . . . The top Australian team , Natalie Cook and Kerri Pottharst , will be spending the next two months in the United States training for the international competition in Hermosa Beach , Calif. , in July . <p> BOXING <p> International Amateur Boxing Association president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test event at Georgia Tech 's Alexander Memorial Coliseum and has all but threatened legal action . But he might be well-advised to turn his attention to the situation in Phoenix . The AIBA Challenge , the event that was to be held at Tech next October but was moved to the AmericaWest Arena because of the Coliseum 's renovation and a lack of financing , is in trouble again . Word is that CBS , which has flip-flopped on televising the Challenge , has backed out . With no U.S. television revenue , there is a chance the Challenge may be moved again - this time to Turkey . <p> CANOE/KAYAK <p> The Champion International Whitewater Series kicks off Monday with slalom races on the Eagle River in Vail , Colo . Reduced to three races this year compared with last year 's four , the series and its $ 39,000 in prize money attracts some of the top international talent . The Vail race will be broadcast later , on June 25 , on the Prime Network . <p> CYCLING <p> Top U.S. rider Lance Armstrong was bad-mouthing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride on the Buckhead course recently changed his mind . " It 's a lot tougher than I thought , " Armstrong said . His observation was echoed by other U.S. hopefuls , including Motorola teammate George Hincapie and Saturn squad rider Norm Alvis . The U.S. riders wanted a tough course and are pleased with their discovery . <p> DIVING <p> Mark Lenzi , who won a gold medal at the 1992 Olympics and hopes to compete in Atlanta next year , is one of several U.S. athletes who will ride floats in the Indianapolis 500 parade this weekend . Although Indiana is known for car racing and basketball , Indianapolis is also home to U.S. Diving and several other amateur sports federations . <p> EQUESTRIAN <p> Some U.S. riders are n't happy about the date of the Aug. 17-20 Atlanta Cup , an international event at the Georgia International Horse Park . As part of ACOG 's Sports ' 95 Festival , the two-star competition is a practice event for the 1996 Olympic site . It conflicts with a competition in England that is a qualifier for fall European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , says the Federation Equestre Internationale requires a test of the venue and set the date anyway . " This is a brand-new space that has never been used for competition , " she said . " You do n't want the first one to be the Olympics . " Jackson said she 's expecting 60 horses from at least seven countries . <p> FENCING <p> The US Fencing Association will send teams to one championship this fall and then two world championships and the Olympics next year . The non- Olympic events are the 1995 Pan American Under-20 Championships in Martinique on Oct. 26-29 and the 1996 Under-17 and Under-20 World Championships , both in Belgium , on April 1-7 . <p> FIELD HOCKEY <p> The captain of U.S. women 's field hockey , Barb Marois , and the president of the U.S. Field Hockey Association , Jenepher Shillingford , already have plans for the Fourth of July : They will be at the head of the Independence Day parade in Douglasville , where Marois will be grand marshal of the city parade . The Douglasville area has virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July to continue preparations for the Games . <p> GYMNASTICS <p> Jay Thornton of Augusta has been named to the U.S. men 's team that will compete against a Ukrainian team in the Budget Invitational in San Jose on June 17 . Thornton , completing his junior year at the University of Iowa , joins a stocked lineup , including former three-time national champion John Roethlisberger and Mihai Bagiu . A floor exercise specialist , Thornton is a member of the senior elite developmental team and , if he has a strong showing in the U.S. Nationals in August , will maintain a shot at making the Olympic team . <p> JUDO <p> What kind of drive does it take to be an Olympic athlete ? A winding one of about 140 miles on two-lane blacktop . For judo competitor Jo Anne Quiring , the journey to Atlanta has involved a daily trip of 70 miles each way on mountainous roads between her home in Westcliffe , Colo. , and the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs . Until this spring , when U.S. judo officials established Quiring as a resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She left home at 6 a.m. to attend Pueblo Community College . When classes ended at 3:30 p.m. , she drove to Colorado Springs to work out . Rarely was Quiring home before 10 p.m . A ranked judo competitor for more than a decade , Quiring , 31 , has captured numerous national and international titles , but an Olympic win has eluded her . Last month she won at the U.S. Senior Judo Championships , and her tournament-win point total virtually assures her an invitation to the Olympic Judo Trials in January . <p> MODERN PENTATHLON <p> The top dozen American pentathletes , including Atlanta 's Mike Gostigan , are undergoing two weeks of intensive training together in Colorado Springs . Along with Gostigan are Rob Stull , Scott Christy and Jim Gregory . The only missing member is Paul Messenger , who is recovering from tendonitis . . . . The team will spend June competing in Europe , honing its skills for the July 25-30 World Championships in Basel , Switzerland . The next major competition after that will be the Aug. 11-12 World Cup finals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-the-country trips , the seven-member U.S. National team is taking time to catch up on schoolwork and tests and prepare for finals . " I think some of them are n't quite unpacked from Egypt , " team " mom " Lynn Sievers said with a laugh . She and her husband , Ron , have opened their suburban Chicago home to the team , which includes their daughter , Challen . To help them to catch up on schoolwork without cramping the team 's ability to practice , Sievers said , they 've made a schedule to ensure that everybody 's not taking the same mornings off . <p> ROWING <p> One of the more popular quotemeisters on the rowing circuit is lightweight James Martinez , who is heading to Europe for competitions now . But you better not be a television reporter if you want to interview him . Because he admires newsprint recycling efforts , the environmentally zealous Martinez will only talk to newspaper reporters . He made a recent exception , however , for a substantial feature in Sports Illustrated . Although he acknowledges that magazines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feature . " It was a good article , and my ( environmental ) message came out , " said Martinez . Oh , yeah : He conceded that it also helped that the company that supplies paper for SI - Champion International - is a major rowing sponsor . <p> SHOOTING <p> Qualifying for the 1996 Olympic Games begins next month at the 1995 USA Shooting National Championships for rifle , pistol and running target June 29-July 9 at the recently renovated Prado Olympic Shooting Park in Chino , Calif . Skeet , trap and double trap championships will follow July 25-Aug. 5 at the International Shooting Park in Colorado Springs , Colo .

Benning at Columbus , Ga . <p> SOCCER <p> Defender Marcelo Balboa was one of only five U.S. players to play every minute of last year 's unlikely World Cup run , and this weekend against Costa Rica in Tampa , Balboa will become the first player to appear in 100 international matches for the U.S. Balboa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of players in the game 's history to reach the century mark . Balboa , the only American named to France Football magazine 's All-World Cup team last summer , currently plays for Leon in the Mexican First Division . <p> SOFTBALL <p> Now that they 've lured the first-ever Olympic softball games to town , Columbus ' softball promoters are n't resting . " Our vision is to take over the role of the softball capital of the world , " said Carmen Cavezza , executive director of Columbus ' 96 , the local coordinating committee for Olympic softball . To do that , they 're trying to convince the game 's international overseer - the International Softball Federation - to move to town . The ISF now shares quarters in Oklahoma City with the Amateur Softball Association . But the federation is thinking about moving into a home of its own , so Columbus and cities in California and Colorado are trying to entice it away . <p> SWIMMING <p> Some of the top swimmers in the country will compete in the Alamo Challenge in Ft . Lauderdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jager , B.J. Bedford , Greg Burgess , Nicole Haislett , Jon Olsen , Eric Namesnik , Kristine Quance and Allison Wagner . The one member of the U.S. Swimming Resident National Team who will be missing is Summer Sanders . Sanders , who recently came out of retirement , had promised to attend a pool dedication in her hometown of Roseville , Calif . . . . Ashley Chandler of Atlanta is competing in the Inter- ' 92 meet in Paris as part of the U.S. junior national team . Chandler , 16 , won the 50-meter freestyle at the U.S. Spring Nationals . <p> SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING <p> Behind every great synchronized swimmer stands . . . a ballet-dancer husband ? At least that 's the case with Becky Dyroen-Lancer , arguably the greatest athlete ever in the sport and a dead-on favorite to lead the U.S. squad in Atlanta in 1996 . The reigning world and national champ in solo , duet and team , Dyroen-Lancer , 24 , attributes much of her success to husband Kevin , a former professional ballet dancer whom she married 2 1/2 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helps choreograph her routines , Dyroen-Lancer says in the latest issue of " Olympian " magazine . Adding to the " All in the Family " feel for Dyroen- Lancer , her married sister , Suzannah Bianco , 22 , competes right along with her in the team event . <p> TABLE TENNIS With a chance to assert itself as a force in world table tennis just a year before it hosts the 1996 Olympic Games , the U.S. team fell far short of expectations this month at the world championships in Tianjing , China . The team had its second-worst showing in the event 's history , with the men 's and women 's teams finishing 25th and 20th , respectively . They finished 14th and 16th two years ago . TEAM HANDBALL <p> The Atlanta-based U.S. men 's national team will have its third coach since March , as Rick Oleksyk takes over June 1 , relieving Spaniard Javier Garcia Cuesta of duties . Some in the U.S. federation , a laggard in the European-dominated sport , wanted an American coach and a reduction in Cuesta 's $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has reached a marketing agreement with Cumberland Mall worth $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 in cash . Promotions could start by August . A Russian club team will start training with the U.S. women today . The teams will scrimmage at Westminster next week . . . . Egypt emerged as the biggest surprise at the Men 's World Championships , qualifying for the Olympics . Four of 12 Olympic slots remain open . The U.S. , 0-5 in Iceland , qualified as the host nation . <p> TENNIS <p> Sometimes , it just may be in the stars and not in ourselves . At least , that may be the case for Vince Spadea , a 20-year-old American rattling the rackets and brains of opponents . He gave the world 's No. 1 player , Andre Agassi , all he could handle before losing 6-4 , 6-4 in Atlanta . Now Spadea , who lives in Florida , is in Europe trying to work his way into the French Open . " I served as hard as I could , " said Goran Ivanisevic " and the ball kept coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has climbed from a near 100 position to the 50s and is still moving up . Unfortunately for him , rankings determine Olympic slots , and he has not been on the tour long enough to even began a challenge to Agassi , Pete Sampras and Michael Chang . But Spadea is rising through the ranks like a rocket . <p> TRACK AND FIELD <p> Olympic champion Carl Lewis , never a fan of USA Track and Field or its chief honcho , Ollan Cassell , advocates a separate body to oversee the professional athletes in the sport - complete with its own commissioner . " The idea is to market the sport , get sponsors , " Lewis said . " Then , track becomes more glamorous . Kids want to run it . When it comes to the decision of whether to play football or run track , they can say , ' Well , you can make more money in football , but you can still do good in track , so I 'll run . ' " . . . Leroy Burrell , the 100-meter world record-holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of his left foot . The nagging injury could make him less a factor at next month 's U.S. outdoor championships , which serve as a qualifying meet for the world championships . . . . The winner of the men 's Olympic marathon trials Feb. 17 in Charlotte figures to pocket the biggest check in marathon history - $ 100,000 . Prize money for the top finishers totals $ 250,000 , down to $ 1,000 for 15th place . . . . Most of the world 's premier sprinters are in the 5-9 to 5-11 range . At almost 6-3 , Olympic and world 100-meter champion Linford Christie busts the mold . " There is a saying that a good big one always beats a good little one , " he cracked . " I believe that . " <p> VOLLEYBALL <p> Friday and Saturday , the World League competition for the U.S. men 's volleyball team moves to Havana , where younger players will learn first- hand about home-court advantage . Powered by first-year opposite hitter Chris Underwood , who racked up 25 and 23 kills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iowa . The World League carries a $ 6 million purse and includes the top 12 men 's teams , with Italy the defending champions . <p> WATER POLO <p> Giving more money to medal winners will be discussed this weekend at U.S. Water Polo 's national convention in Ft . Lauderdale . While the USOC 's Operation Gold already provides cash for medal-winning team members ( gold : $ 15,000 ; silver : $ 10,000 ; bronze : $ 5,000 ) , the U.S. team wants the national federation to pony up an additional $ 10,000 for its 13 players if they win a medal in ' 96 . Italy and Spain give as much as $ 75,000 for a gold medal . Executive director Bruce Wigo says the money could be incentive in a bronze medal game , which the U.S. lost in ' 92 . <p> WEIGHTLIFTING <p> Superheavyweight Mark Henry , returning to the competition that is his first love , set a national powerlifting record last weekend at the Texas State Powerlifting Meet in San Antonio . Henry deadlifted 850 pounds , breaking his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadlift and a 1,000-pound squat at the national powerlifting meet in July . Henry is recovering from a hand injury that makes it difficult to do the clean movement in the clean-and-jerk . <p> WRESTLING <p> April 's World Cup of Freestyle Wrestling in Chattanooga was the first time since 1978 that a team from Iran had competed in the U.S. , and Iranian fans responded by making up about half the crowd . But USA Wrestling officials had not as of Tuesday received documents confirming that Iran will participate in the World Championships in Atlanta Aug. 10- 13 , even though the ( flexible ) deadline was May 25 . Documents from Russia and Cuba had n't arrived yet , either , but those countries have said they 're coming . Political tensions continue between the U.S. and Iran , and USA Wrestling probably wo n't send a team to the Espoir ( age 16-20 ) World Championships in Tehran , Iran , in July . " We 'll do everything we can to help them get here , " said Rich Bender , USA Wrestling 's Manager of National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about 2,000 tickets ( to Iranian fans ) . " . . . Six athletes have petitioned their way into the U.S. World Team Trials June 2-3 , arguing that injury or illness prevented them from qualifying through the nationals May 5-6 .
