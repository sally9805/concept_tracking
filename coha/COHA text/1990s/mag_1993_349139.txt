ARE WE AT 500 CHANNELS YET ? THE LATEST channel to vie for a spot on the increasingly crowded cable dial is the TV Food Network , which will serve up a 24-hour schedule of recipes , cooking tips and news of health and nutrition . Among the programs being planned : an interview show in which celebrities talk about food with host Robin Leach and a consumer series on feeding your family for $75 a week . <P> Financed by the Providence Journal Co. , TV Food plans to debut in November and hopes to attract a portion of the $40 billion annual advertising budget of food and packaged-goods companies . Vice chairman Reese Schonfeld insists that programming will be a piece of cake . " There 's almost nothing you can do on television that you ca n't do with a food angle , " he says . A dozen years ago , Schonfeld cooked up a little channel called CNN , so he at least knows his way around the kitchen .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
