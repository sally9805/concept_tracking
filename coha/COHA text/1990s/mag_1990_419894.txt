CORPORATE PROFILE <p> For 10 years , Franklin Thomas ' visionary leadership has helped reshape the Ford Foundation  --  and the world <p> Franklin Augustine Thomas had just been appointed president of the Ford Foundation in 1979 when a senior executive pulled aside the former lawyer from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn , N.Y. , and offered two scenarios . The way this longtime foundation administrator saw it , the new head of the world 's richest philanthropic organization could do one of two things : maintain the status quo by awarding most of the institution 's grant money to existing programs , ( that , Thomas was advised , would keep the board of trustees happy ) , or he could completely overhaul the 44-year-old foundation and take a hard look at its entire operation . The latter option , Thomas was warned , would more than likely rock the foundation and might result in him having an embarrassingly brief tenure as president . Thomas , however , has never been one to shy away from a challenge and the tough-minded foundation leader was not about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the bespectacled Thomas , who oozes a quiet , unflappable confidence . The 55-year-old Thomas was determined to put his stamp on the Ford Foundation and to do that , he deemed it necessary to become intimately familiar with all of the inner workings of the nonprofit institution . " I did n't come here to retire or to relax , " explains the six-foot , four-inch Thomas while casually dangling his right leg off the edge of his chair in his 10th floor office on 43rd Street in midtown Manhattan . " I came here because it was an extraordinary opportunity . If you strike out as a result of trying to do your job in its entirety , there 's no dishonor in that  --  certainly none to me . But to not have tried is unthinkable . " Thomas did n't just try to remake the Ford Foundation in his own image , he did it . During the past 10 years , Thomas has rebuilt the venerable foundation brick by brick . He reorganized the program divisions , streamlined the staff and most important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $2.3 billion to $5.7 billion . <p> Instead of being chased out of his office on a rail for making such bold moves , Thomas , who earns $326,000-a-year as Ford Foundation president , has instead become a paragon of a foundation executive , combining compassion and sensitivity with the tough management skills that are needed to keep any foundation on sound financial footing . Along the way he had increased the number of minorities on the professional staff from 8.3% to 14% and expanded opportunities for women , who now make up more than half of the staff . <p> " Franklin Thomas combines a business mind with a great social conscience , " says former U.S. representative Yvonne Braithwaite Burke , a member of Ford 's board of trustees . " He has a security about him that makes it possible for him to make decisions that I find most blacks or whites in those kinds of positions will not make . " <p> Says Susan V. Berresford , vice president of the foundation 's program division , " Frank is an extraordinarily thorough manager . He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very impressive and very interesting . He has a very clear vision of where the foundation ought to be going . " <p> Adds Barron M. Tenny , vice president , secretary and general counsel of the foundation , " Frank is very engaged and interested in every facet of the Ford Foundation . He 's knowledgeable about the program 's activities , about investment management and about administration . There is no area of the foundation that he 's not interested in . " Always Feeling ' Special ' <p> The self-assured Thomas has always held an unfettered view of where he wanted to go and he has never let what he repeatedly calls " external impositions " such as race or others ' perception of him deter him . Not that some people have n't tried . Thomas recalls an incident with a playmate in Bedford-Stuyvesant when he was about 6 years old . After playing outside , the young boy invited Thomas inside . " I remember going to his house  --  he was white  --  and being stopped at the door , " Thomas recalls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was stopped at the door by his mother or aunt , or someone , I do n't remember , and I was n't allowed to come into the house . So , I went home and I told my mother what had happened . She just said , ' Oh , they 're prejudiced . ' I thought then  --  and in a fundamental way it was true  --  that they had some sickness . They had a problem . That attitude had permeated my life . When someone expressed a limitation or hostility , my threshold reaction was that they had a problem , not that there was something wrong with me . " <p> And his mother would n't let him feel any other way . Born in Barbados , Viola Thomas ' husband died when Franklin was 11 years old . She also lost her oldest son to pneumonia . But she managed to support Franklin and her four older daughters by doing domestic work . She also worked as a machinist at the American Can Co. during World War II . But when the soldiers returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hired in their absence . Viola Thomas went back to domestic work , singing in the choir and keeping her family intact . In addition to instilling a strong sense of values in her children , Viola Thomas , who died in 1973 , reserved a special place in her heart for Franklin . Whether it was riding on the trolley cars or making his daily visit to the corner store , Franklin always felt special . He knew that the only limits on his talents would be limits he placed there himself . <p> Franklin was active in the Concord Baptist Church Boy Scout troop in Brooklyn , was the star center and captain of his Franklin K. Lane High School basketball team and was an outstanding scholar . But it was an incident involving his mother that led him to a career in law . He tells of his hard-working mother saving furiously for a down payment on a house , only to be swindled out of it , It was at that point , Thomas says , that he decided to become a lawyer . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas continued to play basketball , however . ) At Columbia , he began what was to become a familiar pattern in his life : He became a standout in areas usually reserved for whites . He was the only black on the basketball team  --  and he became its captain , a first for an Ivy League School . He set a school record for rebounds and was twice voted the league 's most valuable player . <p> After graduating from Columbia in 1956 with a Bachelor of Arts degree , Thomas made use of his college ROTC service by spending four years in the Air Force . He rose to first lieutenant and became a navigator for the Strategic Air Command . Thomas returned to Columbia 's law school and began moving in elite power circles as easily as he ran up and down the basketball court . His first job out of law school when he graduated in 1963 was as an attorney for the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency . He was an assistant U.S. Attorney for Manhattan and served two years as New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the late 1960s , Thomas caught the eye of someone who was toying with the idea of establishing a community-based redevelopment organization in Bedford-Stuyvesant . That someone was Sen. Robert F. Kennedy . Although no one knew it at the time , this experimental project would lay the foundation for thousands of similar nonprofit community organizations that would spring up in other communities across the nation . The Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp . was founded in 1967 and Franklin Thomas was elected its first president and chief executive officer . During his 10-year stay with the community development corporation ( CDC ) , Thomas raised $63 million in public and private funds , enabling it to generate 123 new community businesses , 3,300 new jobs , 650 new or rehabilitated housing units as well as renovating the exteriors of 3,000 homes and developing a $21 million mortgage pool for neighborhood residents . <p> In 1977 , after 10 years on the job , Thomas resigned to practice law in the private sector . He also chaired a study commission on U.S. policy toward South Africa and served as director on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : CBS , Inc. ; Citicorp/ Citibank ; AT &T,; Alcoa , and Cummins Engine Co . Ushering In The Franklin Thomas Era <p> When trustees at the Ford Foundation wanted someone to succeed McGeorge Bundy as president , they did n't have to search too far . Seated with them for two years was the ideal person to shepherd the foundation into the 1980s-and beyond . In the largely white world of charitable philanthropy , it was not surprising that " external " references were repeatedly made to Thomas ' race . Largely ignored was that his unique combination of grassroots organizing , his legal training , his worldly knowledge and his stellar credentials were exactly what the Ford Foundation needed at that point . When Thomas took over in 1979 , the foundation was still closely linked to the identity  --  and the interests  --  of Bundy , a former Harvard dean and White House national security adviser . Unlike Thomas , Bundy craved the spotlight and used his influential post to push some of his favorite causes such as arms control and national security . Thomas , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works diligently and deliberately behind the scenes . The significance of the selection was not lost on the black community and particularly Vernon Jordan , then president of the National Urban League . " This is the most significant black appointment in my time ... the first real example of a case where whites have turned meaningful power over to a black . " And Thomas was n't reluctant to use that power . He reorganized programs into five thematic areas : urban poverty , rural poverty ; human rights and social justice ; governance and public policy ; education and culture and international affairs . Instead of separate domestic and international program divisions , both were merged into one office . <p> Reflecting on his four years as Thomas ' general counsel at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp . and the last seven years he has worked with him at the Ford Foundation , Barron Tenny , the foundation 's vice president , secretary and general counsel says Thomas " is essentially the same person now as he was then . He has the same concerns about social issues , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same management style . " <p> When Thomas is asked to cite his greatest asset , he does n't hesitate to reply : " It 's my ability to see issues , problems and opportunities from multiple perspectives and to find ways of causing people and institutions to embrace and welcome efforts at collaboration . " Others who know him say that he also has a keen eye for attracting talent and positioning it so that it will function and flourish . Virtually everyone interviewed mentioned his ability to think clearly and his excellent recall  --  even for the smallest of details . Because he rarely grants interviews and generally shuns publicity , Franklin Thomas is not a household name . His press office frequently receives invitations for him to appear on talk shows , but they usually phone producers back with his decision to decline . Those who do get the opportunity to talk to Thomas often find it difficult to get a handle on him because he 's as comfortable in corporate boardrooms as he is playing a pickup game of basketball . <p> Perhaps Thomas ' greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalize the link between community organizations patterned after the Bedford-Stuyvesant Corp . and government resources . A decade ago , the Ford Foundation enlisted the aid of corporate donors to put up $10 million to form the Local Initiatives Support Corp . ( LISC ) . The LISC was established to serve as an umbrella development agency for community development agencies in distressed neighborhoods , providing them with loans , grants and technical assistance . In 10 years , LISC has raised more than $300 million for community-based development projects , attracted an additional $1.3 billion from public and private sources and helped revitalize more than 100 distressed neighborhoods . LISC already has exceeded Thomas ' wildest expectations , but he 's not resting on his laurels . <p> " I think those of us already engaged in the work of community revitalization also need to ask ourselves hard questions about our strategies and approaches , " he said in a speech last fall in observance of LISC 's 10th anniversary . " I think we must reconsider broader needs of poor communities as they are threatened by drugs , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be confident that the work of building communities is another project . If we 're going to base our hopes on these buildings being a lasting resource , then we must be ready to devise strategies that address the many social problems people living in and around these buildings face . " <p> Thomas ' 10 years have paralleled Ronald Reagan 's years in the White House  --  a period of retrenchment in civil rights and cuts in social programs for the needy . As a result of those deep cuts , more and more people have been turning to the philanthropic community to pick up some of the slack . The Ford Foundation , for example , receives about 2,000 pieces of mail each day . Roughly half of that correspondence is grant-related  --  either a proposal or an inquiry . That increased competition alone means that Ford Foundation grants are much harder to obtain . And the organization has moved away from providing routine operating expenses for local groups , preferring to concentrate on broader programs with the potential to impact on large groups of people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and programs in countries around the world . The foundation operates field offices in Peru , Brazil , Mexico , Senegal , Nigeria , Kenya , Egypt , the Sudan , Bangladesh , Beijing , India , Indonesia , Thailand and the Philippines . In its eagerness to line up a variety of supporters behind a cause , the Ford Foundation sometimes does n't get its proper share of the credit . But that 's just another " external " over which Thomas has no control . " It 's not a matter of who gets the credit , " says Thomas . " If you get through that personal need , that will enable you to cause a lot of things to happen . Your name might not be associated with many of them in the public 's mind , but that 's alright-you know what you 've done . " GRANTSMANSHIP : HOW TO GET YOUR IDEA FUNDED <p> Although there have always been individual contributors to worthy causes , foundations remain the primary funding source for individual and group non-profit projects , be it a research and travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to develop a voting registration drive in rural Alabama . <p> In fact , practically any good idea can find a funding source if it is properly packaged and presented . Like any other specially , raising money to fund projects is part art , practice , common sense-and knowing where to go . There are more than 24,000 active foundations in the United States , which fund everything from travel sabbaticals to creative writing projects . Of these , 166 have assets of $50 million or more , according to Foundation Fundamentals , published by the Foundation Center , a Washington D.C.-based clearinghouse for grant-seekers and grant-givers . But most foundations  --  about 800%  --  have assets of less than one million dollars . <p> Regardless of size , every foundation has its own set of rules and funding objectives . And the first rule to keep in mind when seeking foundation financing is to make sure your goals and objectives match the foundation 's goals . Some other key rules to follow : Once you have ascertained that your project or idea is valuable , you must whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foundations loathe granting money to projects where there 's no research . Make sure you know the priorities of the foundations from which you seek funds . Learn all you can about the foundations . Then target your proposals to them . You should , before approaching a foundation , make sure that your organization or project has tax clearance ( i.e. , that it qualifies as a public charity ) from the lnternal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department . Make sure that you follow any timetables the foundations require . Your proposal should be typed , and at a minimum , contain : a ) A cover letter on the organization letterhead signed by the CEO . b ) The main features of your proposal , why you think the foundation should be interested , and the dollar amount and type of support you seek , c ) A table of contents to make reading the proposal easy for the funder . d ) A summary of the project should be included , along with your plan of action and the results you expect . 3 ) Background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking an individual grant , its history and accomplishments and key sources of support ) The problem should be clearly identified and presented as solvable within the scope of your plans . g ) Include what methods you plan to use to achieve your objectives , along with a schedule of when each part of the project is to be completed . h ) Present your evaluation plan of how effective the project is , or will be . i ) Finally , include a detailed . common sense budget on how you plan to use the solicited funds , grant along with any future funding plans you have . Attach all supporting documents such as board of directors , financial statements , your tax status and relevant news clippings , if any , about you or your organization . If you receive a grant , you should immediately send a letter of thanks to the funding institution . If you get rejected and do n't quite know why , ask the foundation for an explanation , along with a query about the feasibility of future support .

BLACK PHILANTHROPY : WHO THE GIVERS ARE <p> According to Emmett Carson , an assistant program officer at the Ford Foundation , African-Americans as a group are far more charitable than any other segment of the American population . Carson says black households donate more than 2.1% of their income to charity , as compared to 1.7% of white families . " Over 150 years ago , says Carson , " organized black philanthropy was already a half-century old . " Carson says interest in African-American philanthropists has been scant until recently because few African-Americans had the wealth rendering them capable of making large gifts . With the increasing wealth of African-American athletes , entertainers and businessmen , as well as the growing prosperity of a Black Middle Class , African-American philanthropy has been growing steadily more visible in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've seen a dramatic increase in individual contributions , so that now individual contributions constitute the larger share of gifts , " says Adrienne Rhodes , director of communications for the United Negro College Fund . " We are still largely supported by African-Americans , and by black women in particular . " <p> Below is a partial listing of some of the more notable bequests made by African-Americans over the past few years . The list is not exhaustive , since most donors prefer anonymity .
