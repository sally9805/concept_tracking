Earth , air , water , fire-the four elements combine to create a fifth Photograph Built into the harbor wall , Bowmore Distillery began operations in 1779 , making it the oldest distillery on Islay // I WENT to Islay for the peat and the sea . Seemingly alone among whisky lovers , I was fairly new to single-malt ( unblended ) Scotch whiskies , having attended a few tastings in this country that left me bewildered by their variety . Nonetheless , I was firm in my preferences : however many whiskies were on a table , I always gravitated toward the smoky , tarry fragrance of peat-the compressed and partly fossilized loam of sphagnum moss and heather-used to roast barley . What I most like is what makes Scotch single-malt most different from other whiskies . Irish almost never uses peat and usually includes unmalted as well as malted barley ; rye and bourbon are based respectively on rye and corn and are also unpeated . Peat is what kept the most distinctive Scotch whiskies from acquiring a wide and appreciative audience until relatively late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sea , and the air to the taste in the bottle . To do this I wanted to walk through a bog and steep myself in the smoke of a peat fire . Islay , jutting into the Atlantic in the Inner Hebrides , west of the Scottish mainland , had it all , I was told : miles of peat bogs , malted barley handraked and roasted on site , and six working distilleries , most of them right on the searesulting in the lip-smackingly salty aftertaste I had also come to crave . Wood is said to account for as much as 50 to 70 percent of a whisky 's flavor . Whether or not flavor components can be assigned precise percentages , the estimate is plausible , given that the flavors in most distilled spirits-vanilla ; the burnt sugar of caramel and toffee ; coffee and chocolate ; various spices , including cinnamon and ginger ; and fruit , especially citrus-are imparted chiefly by oak , and Scotch whisky must age at least three years in wood . In Scotland today that almost always means bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been charred to give color and strong vanilla and fruit flavors . By U S. law bourbon barrels may be used only once , so when they arrive in Scotland , the oak has plenty of flavor and honey color left to give to the transparent " new-make " spirit as it ages . In the Scotland of the past century the wood was often European oak in the form of Spanish sherry barrels , which were shipped full and sold off to distillers after their contents had been bottled . Today Spanish law requires sherry makers to ship their product in bulk , and sherry barrels have become a rare and expensive prestige item for distillers who want the sweet , citrusy flavor and deepmahogany color they give . The flavor that makes me snap to attention seems like distilled smoke that yields to classic vanilla , orange , and toffee and returns to smoke for an aftertaste that can last for hours . I seek the initial slap of what some people call " motor oil " or " iodine " - its technical name is phenol , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savor the more delicate flavors that appear . The shock of the first whiff followed by subtle , lingering pleasure in the mouth is like diving into a cold pond and then deciding you do n't want to get out . I 've never joined the quest for ever-hotter chili peppers , but hunting for peat has made me understand the addiction : once you acquire the taste , whisky seems incomplete without it . On Islay I found fire in high-proof " cask-strength " whiskies , and smoke everywhere . MY bog craving , I learned when I arrived , was misplaced . Like mes Photograph The earthy , seaweedy smoke from peat gives Islay whiskies their signature taste // quite wood chips , peat briquettes have no aroma until they bum . That 's why the little dried clods of earth I had grabbed for and rubbed against my fingers at tastings in the United States were disappointingly odorless . The fault was n't the age of the peat or the overseas shipping . It was the lack of a flame . What is being smoked is a grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of barley must be very important . Indeed , The Macallan , a distillery on the mainland , is proud to use only Golden Promise , a low-yielding oldfashioned barley that it pays farmers to grow-and to grow only from a seed it has patented . ( It may be reviving a nineteenth-century custom , but we are entering the genetically protectionist new millennium . ) A heavy peating , as roasting barley over peat is called , will dominate the flavor of any variety-and Islay distillers are the heaviest peaters of all . In malting , barley is soaked in water and spread out on " malting floors " to germinate for several days , so that enzymatic action will convert starch to sugar as the seed prepares to sprout . Distillers want to stop the growth before a shoot emerges , so that the shoot wo n't get a chance to use any of the sugar they plan to convert to alcohol . Heat kills the germ and hardens the rubbery wet barley , allowing it to be crushed ; the grist is mixed with water and cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for yeast to ferment the sugar to alcohol . ( The type of yeast the distiller chooses to add determines the presence and level of flowery flavor overtones . ) At this point the distiller has made beer ; malt whisky is distilled beer , as cognac is distilled wine . Peat gives barley flavor , and coal and oil do not . Which fuel was used in which region of Scotland was long a question of economics . Soon after a canny liberalization of tax laws in 1823 gave moonshiners incentives to go legal , railroads made coal cheap and easy for most distillers to use in place of peat . Peat was in any case far less abundant than coal in many of the places distillers favored-places chosen mainly for their proximity to good water , which is crucial to flavor and also needed for cooling stills quickly . Islay had no cheap access to coal but never lacked for peat , which covers a quarter of the island 's 246 square miles ; strong and constant sea winds keep the green bluffs mostly barren . The island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distillers today buy all their barley from other parts of Britain or even from other countries . Both sides of the plumb-straight road leading from the Islay airport to the island 's two main villages-a road that " floats " on peat nearly thirty feet deep-are depopulated save for untended sheep , painted with primary-color blotches on their shoulders to identify their owners , and perhaps one or two of the few people who still earn their living cutting peat . I never did get to cut peata great frustration , given that Neil Wilson , whose Scotch &; Water is an excellent introductory guide to whisky-making , told me it was a " disturbingly sensual " experience . But I did hear about it from a forty-oneyear-old Islay-born gamekeeper and whisky fancier named Donald James Macphee , whose father cut peat to supplement the coal he was allotted by his employer , the Caol Ila distillery , on the northeast coast of Islay . Macphee himself cut peat at the beginning of his career , because his annual coal allowance of four tons was not enough to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peat banks virtually free of charge , on condition that the cutter carefully replace the turf over the bottom of the trench , which is usually two to three feet deep . " I would go and take my wife and the two wee ones , and we 'd sleep in the tent , " Macphee told me . " The kids would play about , and we 'd cut a rope of peat " briquettes , which would air-dry for several months before Macphee took them home . I had noticed brightly colored plastic bags along what looked like strip-mined fields , and had wondered that people would simply leave hard-earned fuel for weeks at a time until they found a convenient moment to carry it home . One explanation came from an Islay character and peat-cutter named Norman Campbell-a small and weatherbeaten white-haired man who is reputed to have introduced disco music to Islay and to have adopted a stage name , Norrie Kimble , for karaoke performances that he gives for Japanese visitors on whisky pilgrimages . " I 'd know before the day was out if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Campbell estimates that a dozen or so of Islay 's 3,846 people still cut peat for a living , selling it to householders and distilleries . " There 's plenty of peat for everybody , but they do n't want the work , " he told me . Nor do many young people want what little work the island offers . Macphee told me that perhaps 20 percent of his schoolmates have chosen to stay on Islay ; distilleries do n't provide enough jobs or enough pay to keep most graduates on the island . There is hope that high-tech industries will bring new employment and lower the average age in what is becoming a retirement community . The scent of a peat fire is exhilarating , especially for those who have not had to cut their own fuel . I did achieve one dream by walking in a room-sized peat fire-over one , to be exact , ankle-deep in germinated barley on a mesh floor that allowed the smoke from the furnace below to waft up through the grain . Kilns are architecturally the most distinctive parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peat smoke . The kiln was comfortably warm ; fires are kept low , so that the barley will be heated only enough to kill the germ and stop growth but not enough to halt enzymatic action . The peatiness of the barley , and thus of the whisky , depends on how much peat is used in the first twenty-four hours or so of the two days of drying . After a day of being smoked and dried , maltsters say , the barley is too hard to absorb any more flavorful smoke , so plain hot air finishes the job . The smell of peat smoke is unforgettable-pungent and uplifting , somewhere between burning leaves and buming wood , with notes of wild heather and moss . After I had spent several minutes walking the length of the cozy chamber and admiring the Chinese-style wooden ceiling , my clothes reeked . " You smell like a kipper , " my host said an hour later in the car . I could n't have asked for a nicer compliment . THIS immersion in " peatreek " ( there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden " shiels " to keep the temperature low // a word for it , as for nearly every aspect of making whisky ) took place at the celebrated Laphroaig , one of three improbably beautiful distilleries in hidden coves near Port Ellen , on the southern coast of Islay-perfect for unseen shipments , which explains why illicit distilling occurred there long before 1823 . Laphroaig and its two close neighbors , Lagavulin and Ardbeg , all derive their water from sources that pass through peat , and the distilleries also heavily peat their barley . Although technically not the Islay whisky highest in phenols , Laphroaig has the strongest peatreek in the glass , possibly from the three phenols it says its seaweedy peat emits when burned-different , it claims , from those of any other distillery . Whatever the reason , the blast of pure peat is strong , and is best appreciated in Laphroaig 's youngest and least expensive whisky , its ten-year-old . I fell hard for Lagavulin whisky , which seems to have a unique combination of potent peat and equilibrated smoothness . But I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low white stucco buildings set against dramatic rocks and the sea , or the simple painted-slat vernacular architecture of its offices , recently fitted into a former malting floor and reminiscent of a turn-of-the-century ship . Ardbeg , just down the road , has recently returned to active production after being periodically closed , and has won praise in the maltwhisky world , especially for its seventeenyear-old . The distillery 's ambitious young managers are restoring its buildings with the help of the new parent company , which also owns the mainland single-malt distiller Glenmorangie , and have outfitted a particularly attractive visitors ' center and caf6 in the former malting bam . The pagoda is now a decorative roof , as it is at most of the island 's distilleries  --  only two actually use their kilns , and the rest buy barley peated to their specifications from the local Port Ellen malting company . Ardbeg is lucky to have survived and to be making a name in the malt world : traditionally , more than 95 percent of its whisky was used in blends . Bunnahabhain , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has very likely survived because of its utility in blendsit is a defining component of The Famous Grouse , for years one of the most popular blended whiskies in Scotland . ( A blended whisky may include as many as forty whiskies ; more than half is usually neutral grain alcohol . ) Bruichladdich , another lighter-style Islay distillery , has been " mothballed " since 1994 , when it came under the control of the company that owns Jim Beam . The Port Ellen distillery , in the center of the busy port , where ferries come and go , many of them bearing barley for the malting company , closed for good in 1983 . This inactivity infuriates my host on Islay , Jim McEwan , a kind of globetrotting teacher and showman for the Bowmore distillery , in the center of Bowmore , the island 's largest village . McEwan began as a cooper at the age of fifteen and has performed virtually every job at the distillery , including running it . He generously arranged for me to tour the plants of his rivals ; as whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-island owners , not themselves , and they frequently help one another in small and large ways . He also inculcated in me a taste for Bowmore seventeen- year-old , more delicately balanced in citrus , toffee , and floral notes than most Islay whiskies yet with authoritative peatreek , especially at the finish , and lots of salt . McEwan says that a love of salt is inborn on Islay , and that his mother would accentuate each word of " How was school today ? " by shaking salt into the soup . During my visit McEwan was the master of ceremonies at a tasting held annually to benefit a local group that encourages the handicapped to join in island businesses and activities . The managers of all six operational island distilleries spoke briefly , describing different steps of distillation and aging and always emphasizing the people who performed them . " Remember that when you open a bottle , lots of men come out , " McEwan told the crowd . " The human being is the most important ingredient . " I wo n't open a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product he grew up learning to make , or of the sunny , maternal Christine Logan , who runs the Bowmore visitors ' center and knows seemingly every Islay inhabitant . I wo n't sample a shot of Caol Ila without remembering Donald Macphee 's description of how he and his friends would sneak into the distillery at night when they were ten , seeking the warmth of the kilns , the lights of the parking lot ( the village streets were unlit ) , and also empty lemonade bottles , which they would exchange for penny candy-or his melancholy acceptance of the fact that he is one of the few of his generation to remain on the island . Most distilleries have Web sites that offer further information ; " The Edinburgh Malt Whisky Tour " ( www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/ home/jhb/whisky/ ) , not company-sponsored , is an especially complete site . In addition to Wilson 's Scotch &; Water , Michael Jackson has written several fine guides to single-malts . The best gift for a single-malt lover is membership in the Scotch Malt Whisky Society , whose American branch can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , headquartered in Edinburgh ( www. smws.com ) , publishes marvelous newsletters that offer its exclusive bottlings of whiskies taken from single casks , left at their original proof of about 60 percent rather than being watered down to the standard 40 percent , and not filtered ; this means that they cloud when water is added but , many people say , have more flavor . A $149 first-time membership fee includes a bottle , which usually sells for $85 and up . At its well-conducted tastings , held regularly in Edinburgh and occasionally in various locales in this country , you can quickly and clearly learn the differences between the four major whisky-producing regions of Scotlandand also get the invaluable advice to dilute whisky with room-temperature mineral water to make flavors bloom , in the ratio of one third its volume for normal bottled whisky and one half its volume for caskstrength . The personnel at headquarters share my love of peat , and directed me to superb non-Islay smoky whiskies : Tatisker , from the Isle of Skye ; Brora , from the usually lightly peated Highlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area around Campbeltown , rich in coal and traditionally a producer of lightly peated whisky . But I do n't have to open one of the bottles I brought home , or browse through the latest witty newsletter from the Scotch Malt Whisky Society , to be reminded of Islay . I can just open the big cookie tin I keep in my office-something I do regularly during the afternoon . On my return I put in it a small bag of barley roasted at Laphroaig , together with the oatcakes and digestive biscuits and " tablet " ( something like chalky fudge , and wholly delicious ) I had brought back . After two days the tin and everything in it smelled strongly of peat . I removed the bag . Weeks later the tin still reeks . I open it fondly . <p>
