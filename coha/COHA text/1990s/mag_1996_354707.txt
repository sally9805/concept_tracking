The crucial difference between Ultimate Fighting , the bareknuckle battles on pay-per-view TV that some lawmakers want to ban , and a game we played in grade school called Dirty Soccer is that Ultimate Fighting specifically prohibits biting and eye gouging . <P> I 'm not trying to imply that a contest in which some brute is permitted to pound his opponent into submission by nearly any means at his disposal  --  a knee to the groin , a stomp on the nose  --  is , when all is said and done , slightly wimpish . I certainly mean no disrespect to those who participate in Ultimate Fighting and may list their hobbies as " beating smart alecks to a pulp . " <P> I 'm simply reporting historical fact : nothing was ruled out in Dirty Soccer as played at the Hale H. Cook school in Kansas City , Missouri , in the Golden Age of Dirty Soccer . There is such a thing as brutal competition within limits ( e.g. , the campaign for the Republican nomination ) and such a thing as all-out war ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana ) . <P> Dirty Soccer was all-out war . Of course , a fourth-grader could n't inflict the sort of damage that is within the capabilities of the 275-lb. hulks who go against each other in Ultimate Fighting , but it was not for lack of trying . <P> In Dirty Soccer your aim was to get the ball to the chain-link fence at the end of the field defended by your opponents , as I explained to my wife one day . How you did that was limited only by the efforts of the guys who were biting you and gouging your eye as you carried the ball down the field . <P> " Carried ? " my wife said . " I thought you were n't allowed to carry the ball in soccer . " <P> " That is not the game we were playing , " I reminded her . " We were playing Dirty Soccer . " <P> " But what would the referee say about someone carrying the ball ? " " Why would you need a referee if nothing 's against the rules ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a referee . These guys may act tough , but they have a referee . <P> There is no referee in the battle between Charles and Di . Queen Elizabeth may once have been under the illusion that she was the referee , but she was effectively out of the ring years ago . Also , since much of the fighting is carried on between each principal 's pack of friends  --  packs well matched for loathsomeness  --  it can sometimes spin into the sort of mob frenzy so prized by Dirty Soccer devotees . <P> The Republicans , on the other hand , did have a referee . As it turned out , the referee was Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition . By chance , he looks the part . When you see him on television , you can almost hear some kindly gym coach say , " Neither team going to choose you , Ralph ? That 's O.K. You can be the referee . Also , that way you wo n't get your nice clothes dirty . " <P> The rules were n't posted , but Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Bob Dole " Beltway Bob , " for instance , but Dole was not allowed to call Buchanan an extremist . Bob Dornan was allowed to say anything he wanted to say , for the same reason your wacky Uncle Harry was allowed to say anything he wanted to say . <P> After a while it became obvious that the Republicans had not only a referee but also some influential commissioners who were intent on preventing permanent injuries . Democrats are the only politicians who seem capable of behaving like people who have absorbed the rules of Dirty Soccer .
