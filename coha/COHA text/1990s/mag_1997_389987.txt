A desperate desire to be slender may have cost 22-year-old ballerina Heidi Guenther her life Photograph On a family trip to Flagstaff , Ariz. , in 1992 , Heidi frolicked in a field of flowers . // FINALLY THE YEARS OF PLIES and dreaming had paid off , and ballerina Heidi Guenther was determined to make the most of it . In May 1996 , Guenther , 22 , had been promoted from the Boston Ballet 's apprentice company , where she had been perfecting her technique for two years , to the main corps de ballet . During Boston 's grueling 52 performances of The Nutcracker last Christmas , she performed with remarkable zeal , dancing her own roles and often subbing for other corps members who were sick or injured . By the time the troupe closed its season in May with Cinderella , Guenther was looking noticeably thinner , but not alarmingly so-at least not by ballet standards . " Heidi was a lyrical dancer , " says Boston Ballet artistic director Anna-Marie Holmes , " with a lovely sort of refined quality . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very talented dancer with a gorgeous light jump . " But at what price , many now ask , was that lightness purchased ? For on June 30 , while visiting her family in California during the Boston Ballet 's summer break , Guenther was traveling with her mother and brother to Disneyland when she suddenly dropped dead from cardiac arrest . At the time of her death , the 5 ' ' 3 " dancer weighed only 93 lbs . Friends and family soon believed that she had been dieting relentlessly to maintain what she thought was a suitable ballet body , which may have caused her heart to stop . Officials at the Boston Ballet denied that they had pushed Guenther too hard , arguing that though they had suggested she lose weight two years ago , they had recently urged her to eat more . But to the dancer 's grieving mother , Patti Harrington , those protestations of innocence rang hollow . " The thinner she 'd get , the more roles she 'd get , the more compliments she 'd get , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a real subliminal message that comes with all that . " There is no question that the physical demands and psychological pressures of a top-flight company like the Boston Ballet are at least equal to those of professional sports . " Dancers do feel they could be replaced in a minute , " says James Reardon , who danced with the Boston Ballet from 1976 to 1985 and is now the artistic director of his own small company in Cambridge , Mass . " There 's always somebody in the wings . " Photograph " She danced from the heart , " says her father , Richard , of Heidi ( this spring ) . Photograph " She was getting really thin , " says the Boston Ballet 's AnnaMarie Holmes . // Typically , Boston Ballet dancers spend an hour and a half a day in classes , working on technique , then another six hours in rehearsal , learning the steps for the ballets they will be performing during the season , with little more than a lunch hour and occasional five-minute breaks . All sessions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , studios are lined with floor-to-ceiling mirrors , which invite an almost obsessive selfscrutiny . It is a fiercely competitive world in which physical perfection can often seem like the expected norm , rather than an unattainable ideal . " Your body is your instrument , " says Reardon . " Dancers are constantly evaluating themselves . Do I look good ? ' Do I look bad ? ' How can I look better ? ' " Those , plainly , were the questions that haunted the days and nights of Heidi Guenther . Yet they hardly deterred her . Born in San Diego , the oldest of three children ( her sister , Kirsten , is 20 ; her brother , Quinton , 15 ) , Guenther began demonstrating her physical gifts almost from infancy By the time she was 8 months old , she was walking ; not long after that , she could climb out of her crib . " She was always into things , climbing on things , " says her father , Richard , who separated from Heidi 's mother in 1988 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 6 , like many little girls , she began taking dance classes . " That 's where she just blossomed , " Richard says . " She loved dancing . " Photograph " She loved the limelight , " says mother Patti Har rington of Heidi ( at age TI " Put her onstage and she came alive .

Photograph Heidi ( backstage in Boston recently ) idolized dancers Gelsey Kirkland and Amanda McKerrow. // With her mother 's strong encouragement and support , she set her sights on becoming a professional dancer . At age 11 , she was accepted into a summer program at the Houston Ballet School . From 1987 to 1994 , until securing her spot in Boston , she was a scholarship student with the San Francisco Ballet School . " She was so focused and driven to succeed , " says Melanie Brown , a close friend and dancing partner in San Francisco . " All she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body image first cropped up when she hit puberty and her breasts began to develop . " She did n't like her boobs , " says sister Kirsten , a student at the City College of San Francisco . " She did n't want them . " That year , according to Patti , the San Francisco Ballet told Guenther to lose weight . " It was just devastating to hear , " Patti says . " It was really hard . I felt for her because she felt so bad . " Still , after Heidi lost a few pounds , she did n't seem obsessed about her diet . She and her friends would meet almost daily at a local drive-in and eat chicken strips dipped in ranch dressing , which Heidi would wash down with a chocolate shake . " She ate whatever she wanted to eat , " says her friend Brown . " She was burning it all off anyway . Yet at that age . . . we saw a lot of eating disorders . " The issue became more urgent several years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Boston Ballet 's apprentice company . " She had gotten just a little pudgy at that point , " says Dierdre Myles , who directs the corps de ballet . Artistic director Holmes suggested to Guenther , who weighed about 115 pounds , that her chances of joining the main corps would improve if she dropped 5 . When Guenther returned in August for the next season , Holmes says , she had lost the weight and " looked terrific . " A year later she won her promotion to the Boston Ballet . How much the company is responsible for planting the seeds of what seemingly became an eating disorder is open to debate . In an interview with The Boston Globe after learning of Guenther 's death , Holmes sounded like an advocate of slimmer-is-better . " You see a girl onstage , her butt going up and down , it 's not attractive , " she said . But Holmes insists , and a glance at her dancers confirms , that she is actually rather flexible when it comes to body types in her company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our company is not a company of sticks . . . but you have to have some aesthetic value . People are paying for tickets to see you . " Moreover , the Boston Ballet did eventually encourage Guenther to maintain a healthy weight . As whispers began circulating in the company that she was looking thinner than usual , she was asked several times if she was eating properly . In her official evaluation last January , Guenther 's dancing was praised , but she was cautioned about her diet . " Be careful not to get too thin , " the evaluation read . " We are concerned and hope you are eating well . " Guenther signed a statement acknowledging that she had been cautioned . " That 's about all we can do , " says Holmes , emphasizing that Guenther was an adult and a paid professional . In May , Guenther had a routine physical with a dance-company doctor and a nutritionist , who noted no serious problems . Indeed , her weight was hardly unusual for a young dancer . " She was thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of dying . " Photograph " She was silly , " says Freund ( left , with Heidi 's friend Melanie Brown ) . " A real goof. " // It is now clear , however , that Guenther had not taken the company 's warnings to heart . When Heidi arrived home on June 11 , her mother was taken aback at how skinny she looked . " She was thin , too thin , and I said that to her , " recalls Harrington . " She said , Yeah , I 'm going to gain a few pounds . ' " Kirsten says that her sister was down to a size 1- " and that looked baggy on her . " Harrington was also dismayed to discover that her daughter had started smoking . All the same , Guenther showed no outward signs of an eating disorder . At a barbecue she reluctantly ate just a small piece of steak . But her spirits were good , she seemed to have plenty of energy , and no one caught her throwing up after a meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have acted on it , " says Harrington . Photograph " I always had tears in my eyes when she danced , " says Heidi 's father . // On June 30 , Heidi , her mother and Quinton set out by car for their annual visit to Disneyland . Heidi was laughing and joking much of the way . They stopped to stay overnight with longtime family friends Rosie and Randy Morrison . " She looked much thinner than I had ever seen her-ever , " says Rosie . When she asked Heidi what she weighed she just " blew me off . " Around 9 p.m. , after a quick run to the convenience store , Patti , Rosie and Heidi were stopped at a gas station in Paso Robles when Heidi suddenly fell backward in the minivan . " No gasp , no cry , no nothing , " says her mother . " When I opened the door and she fell out , her eyes were fixed , her lips were blue . " Frantic , Patti began screaming , " Heidi , wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 p.m. she was pronounced dead at a local hospital . A later search of her belongings uncovered a stash of over-the-counter laxatives . She was also taking herbal pills , which she may have been using as a diet aid . Just how her weight loss could have contributed to her death is speculative . An autopsy showed no heart deformities , and tests revealed no unusual substances in her blood . But doctors caution that excessive use of diet aids can , under certain circumstances , lead to cardiac arrest . And the family did have a history of heart trouble . Richard Guenther 's father died of heart failure at age 37 , and his mother and sister have also suffered attacks . Photograph " She tried to push herself , " says sister Kirsten with brother Quinton. " it was like , if you 're going to do it , do it right .

" I knew she was n't going to be able to do this forever , " he says . " I 'd tell her , Heidi , you ca n't put all your eggs in one basket . ' " But for the moment , she would n't hear such talk . " She was very headstrong , dedicated and focused , " he says . As many experts would agree , young women with eating disorders often exhibit an extreme perfectionism , though doctors are wary of predicting which individuals are most at risk . " There 's a complex psychological underpinning to eating disorders , " says Dr. Michael Strober of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute , who treated actress Tracey Gold when she developed anorexia . " The question becomes , why do some people in the face of pressures to control the body 's natural form develop these problems , " he says , " and others do not .

For now , they are left only with fond memories of a slip of a girl who loved ladybugs , sunflowers and , above all else , dancing . Her father recalls one trip he made with Heidi to Flagstaff , Ariz. , in 1992 . During a severe thunderstorm it suddenly started to hail . " Ahh , I 've never danced in the snow , " said Heidi . With the hail pelting down and covering the ground , she ran outside and began dancing a scene from Swan Lake in the street . With each pirouette , says her father , she seemed to become more and more lost in her own fantasy . * BILL HEWITT * GABRIELLE SAVERI and KEN BAKER in San Francisco , LYNDON STAMBLER and JULIE JORDAN in Los Angeles and NANCY DAY in Boston <p>
