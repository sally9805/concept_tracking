<p> THE political parameters for the environment used to be fairly clear and simple . Clean air , clean water , a pristine bit of the outdoors to relax in and all was right with nature . At least for most people . <p> But as the world moves into the 21st century , the definition of a healthy environment is becoming much more complicated . Sustainable resources . Biological diversity . Degradation far outside the atmosphere . Cross-border pollution . Such things quickly shift the political debate from the state of nature to questions about economic policy - and just as quickly to individual values . <p> " Certainly , as rational individuals we now understand that the viability of our economic system depends upon our resource base , " says former US Sen. Gaylord Nelson , organizer of the original Earth Day and now counselor to The Wilderness Society . <p> Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson , who recently won his second Pulitzer Prize , calls this " the new environmentalism ... a combination of conservation of resources with sustainable economic development over the longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters they may have to adjust " lifestyle " to preserve the planet , or to convince economists that the way they gauge " growth " and define " development " may have to change ? Can they do it in a way that convinces people it 's in their own best interest ... and especially the interest of their children ? <p> Experts say the picture is mixed . <p> European Community ( EC ) countries last year pledged to stabilize carbon-dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 , a political decision that will affect jobs and transportation . " This was an extraordinary event and one which certainly two years ago nobody would have foreseen , " says Jessica Tuchman Mathews , vice president of the World Resources Institute . <p> Several countries in Europe have adopted " carbon taxes " to force a reduction in polluting emissions . " Most of them are still nominal , but at least they 're starting to move in the right direction , " says Lester Brown , president of the Worldwatch Institute . <p> Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A number of Northern European countries , says Dr. Mathews , " are doing sweeping examinations of how they tax - shifting the tax burden from ' goods ' - labor and productivity - to taxing ' bads ' - energy use and pollution . " <p> Meanwhile , international lending agencies ( whose finances are controlled by governments ) increasingly are taking environmental questions into account in the projects they approve . <p> Whereas the World Bank 10 years ago had just a handful of environmental experts - not enough to even read all the proposals - there now is a large department examining such issues . " More important , people with environmental expertise are in the regional offices , " says Mathews . <p> The United Nations is holding an international conference on the environment and development next year in Brazil where such issues will be confronted directly . The goal , says UN Undersecretary-General Maurice Strong , " is to place the environment squarely at the center of economic decisionmaking , so that we can balance our economic aspirations against our environmental imperatives . " <p> Leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected to resist any talk of putting environment ahead of economic progress . In a speech on global warming , Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said there should be " no limits to economic growth . " <p> George Bush made his position clear in his recent energy strategy , which emphasizes oil and gas production and the construction of nuclear facilities over conservation and alternative energy sources . Earlier , he told a conference on climate change that environmental policies " must be consistent with economic growth and free-market principles in all countries . " <p> Likewise , Mr. Bush is pushing for a quick US-Mexico trade agreement that environmentalists say could increase pollution along the border since Mexico has laxer regulations than the US . In order to promote trade , the administration also wants easier pesticide standards for exports than now apply within this country . <p> " Japan Inc. " - Asia 's powerhouse network of politicians and business leaders - is rushing to develop " environmentally friendly " industries . But Japan still gets black marks from the World Wildlife Fund and other conservation groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing countries , for moving its most polluting industries to Malaysia and other poorer countries , and for importing more endangered species than any other country . <p> In the Pacific Northwest , two situations show the importance of long-range political planning and economic adjustment to protect the environment - and the costs of avoiding those hard decisions . <p> For years , politicians here resisted efforts to limit logging of old-growth timber , despite evidence that " indicator species " were declining and forests were in trouble . The federal government now has declared the northern spotted owl a threatened species , and lawmakers outside the region are taking more control of this part of the region 's economy . <p> In contrast , agency officials and politicians 10 years ago recognized that hydroelectric dams , agricultural practices , and other economic decisions threatened many species of migrating salmon . While certain fish stocks in the Columbia River Basin have steadily declined , regional and state agencies are much farther ahead in developing a plan to mitigate the losses . Importantly , the public knows and generally accepts the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . <p> This coincides with national polls showing not only greater concern for the environment but also a shift in values from material goods to things like the quality of home and family life . <p> " What can be hoped for is a gradual weakening of the consumerist ethos of affluent societies , " writes Worldwatch Institute researcher Alan Durning in the organization 's latest " State of the World " report . " Ultimately , personal restraint will do little , though , if not wedded to bold political steps against the forces promoting consumption . " <p> That means hard decisions emphasizing long-term , sustainable development that protects natural resources rather than economic growth for short-term gain , says Harvard 's Wilson .
