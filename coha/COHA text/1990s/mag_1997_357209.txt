Let 's say , just for argument 's sake , that you have been bitten by the Elvis bug . You dye your hair black , don a white rhinestone-studded jumpsuit , curl your upper lip into a passable sneer and venture forth . You start the world 's 481st Elvis fan club . You print up personalized Elvis stationery and Elvis T shirts , and start a Web page with photos of Graceland . You throw Elvis-themed parties . <P> Having your way with the image of a long-dead superstar  --  it may sound like innocent if somewhat obsessive fun . Legally speaking , however , virtually everything you are doing is a form of copyright infringement . If you keep it up , you are likely to receive , as have thousands before you , something called a cease-and-desist order from a company in Memphis , Tenn. , telling you that no matter how many times you may have loyally sat through Viva Las Vegas or Roustabout on the late show , you may not use the name and image of the King without the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minions will visit upon you what might be termed , in the vernacular , a hunka hunka burnin ' litigation . And you will lose , because this company is bigger and richer than you are and has been down this road before . <P> The name of this tenacious corporation , not coincidentally , is Elvis Presley Enterprises . It controls much of the half-billion-dollar global Elvis industry , strictly limiting the world 's supply of singing hound-dog dolls , Heartbreak Hotel matchboxes , leather-jacketed teddy bears and pink Cadillac key chains  --  not to mention the Graceland mansion in Memphis , headwaters of all things Elvis . As that city licks its lips in anticipation of the 75,000 free-spending fans who are expected for the 20th anniversary of the King 's death on Aug. 16 , Elvis Presley Enterprises reigns supreme as the guardian , keeper and main arbiter of one of America 's most prominent cultural myths . It owns one of the most prodigiously popular " brands " on earth , one whose potential to generate revenue may have only just begun to be tapped . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis Presley 's Memphis , a theme restaurant and nightclub that opened last week in Memphis ( opening act : folksinger Jewel , " the kind of entertainer , " an EPE spokesman maintained , " Elvis would have selected were he alive today " ) . The company hopes that similar clubs , all serving the deep-fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches Elvis adored ( as well as more healthful fare ) , will follow in Orlando , Fla. , and New York City  --  not to mention an entire Elvis mini-resort in Las Vegas .
