Section : NUTRITION NEWS <p> Coming soon to a supermarket near you ... white bread , pasta and rice  --  now fortified with folate . Getting enough of this B vitamin  --  400 micrograms a day  --  is so important for women of childbearing age that the federal government has now decided to require that folate , or folic acid , be added to certain grain foods . Here 's what you need to know : <p> What does the law say ? White rice and all foods made from refined flour or corn meal that are enriched with B vitamins and iron must also be enriched with folate by January 1998 . But the Food and Drug Administration has given manufacturers the O.K. to add it now . <p> Why is enough folate so crucial ? Studies prove that supplements of 400 mcg. folate help prevent neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida . These defects occur in the developing fetus before most women know they are pregnant , so getting enough folate prior to conception is important . Also , diets low in folate are linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Median daily consumption in the United States ? For men , 266 mcg. ; for women , 195 mcg . ) <p> A new study hints that folate may help the brain stay in tip-top shape . In a group of Spanish people 65 and older , those eating more than 200 mcg. of folate per day scored better on tests for mental sharpness and the ability to function independently than those who ate less folate ( Journal of Nutrition , August 1996 ) . ( But we do n't know yet whether taking more folate would actually improve mental status in the low-folate group . ) <p> How much folate will enriched foods deliver ? An average slice of white bread , half a hamburger roll or small dinner roll : about 40 mcg . A half-cup serving of white pasta , noodles or rice : about 60 mcg . ( You can already buy breakfast cereals enriched with folate  --  often 100 mcg. , listed as 25% DV . ) <p> Will whole-wheat products or brown rice be enriched with folate ? No . But my recommendation , nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . I say that because whole grains contain fiber and minerals like magnesium and zinc that are lost if the bran and germ are refined away . <p> So how do you make certain to get enough folate ? " It 's difficult to get 400 mcg. a day from natural foods unless you consistently eat several of the highest sources , like lentils , orange juice and spinach , " admits David Erickson , DDS , PhD , director of the division of birth defects at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta . As a result , Dr. Erickson has publicly urged doctors to tell patients about the proven and potential benefits of vitamin supplements containing 400 mcg. of folate  --  especially for women of childbearing age . ( Note : Many multivitamin supplements contain 400 mcg . ) <p> If I do choose enriched white bread and pasta , will I get enough folate ? Maybe . If you eat about 4 slices of enriched bread ( a total of 160 mcg. ) , a half-cup of enriched pasta ( 60 mcg. ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could reach 400 mcg . If not , especially without folate-enriched cereal , you 're likely to fall short . <p> If I take a supplement with 400 mcg. folate , will I get too much if I also eat folate-enriched foods or foods naturally high in folate ? It 's unlikely unless you 're a big eater  --  intakes up to 1,000 mcg. a day are safe . The only problem with higher intakes is that they could mask a deficiency of vitamin B12 that affects about 10% of older people  --  a deficiency that should be treated . Adults 65 and older should ask their doctors about taking folate supplements . <p> Will my body absorb the folate in folate-enriched foods ? Yes . In fact , studies show the form of folate used in enriched foods and supplements is actually absorbed better by our bodies than the type of folate found in foods naturally . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Holly McCord with Sarah Robertson , Laura Goldstein and Teresa Yeykal <p> <p> Holly McCord , R.D. is the Nutrition Editor for Prevention <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
