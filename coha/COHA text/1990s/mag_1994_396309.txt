When more than 90 percent of American Airlines ' 21,000 flight attendants went on strike on November 18 , the action was a victory for women and a wake-up call for labor . Eighty-five percent of American 's flight attendants  --  and indeed an estimated 85 percent of all U.S. flight attendants  --  are women . They work under demeaning conditions that reinforce their image as airborne escorts . A cruise through the company handbook on appearance standards shows the draconian regulations . Take earrings , for example : " Animals ... moving parts , airplanes , lightning bolts , etc. are not allowed . " Attendants also must wear makeup , they have to wear heels when walking through airports , and they must meet strict weight requirements . The union , the Association of Professional Flight Attendants ( APFA ) , said it struck over the issues of pay , scheduling , health benefits , staffing  --  and respect . The inordinately stringent appearance standards , while not an issue at the bargaining table , reflect the overall lack of respect afforded flight attendants by management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier , but the union says it ranks fifth among major carriers in salaries paid to flight attendants . With a median annual salary of $23,000 , American flight attendants join other attendants among the ranks of the lowest paid workers in an industry run by highly paid men . Most attendants earn less than a fourth of what pilots earn , and less even than baggage handlers . The newer American attendants  --  hired in the early 1980s  --  were also forced to give wage concessions to the company to keep it competitive . One of the union 's main demands was to close the wage gap between junior and senior attendants . Attendants also objected to the particulars of the company health plan , as well as to a retirement plan that required them to pay up now for future benefits . Staffing changes  --  management wanted the latitude to assign as few as five attendants to large planes instead of up to l5  --  were also at issue . As was a particularly onerous rule change that had to do with making up lost flight time . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 hours in the air per month . The company wanted to require an attendant to make up the hours lost due to canceled flights anytime during the month , as opposed to immediately following the cancellation . Attendants argued that the change would especially hurt working parents , since they would be on call all month , thus complicating child care arrangements . The wheels for redressing these grievances were put in motion in April 1992 . At that time , Denise Hedges , the newly elected president of APFA , quietly started building consensus among members . Prior to Hedges ' election , APFA  --  an independent American Airlines flight attendants union  --  had been splintered by the leadership of an unpopular president who had lost the support of many members . Hedges knew that because the current contract would be up in December 1992 , it was time to do some spadework in Washington . When all indications were that candidate Bill Clinton would become President Bill Clinton , she got to know the Clinton team . By the time the contract negotiations were falling apart , Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that since he 'd waffled on a number of issues , he 'd be eager to improve his image by helping to settle an airline dispute  --  should one arise . She also figured that Clinton could n't be worse than President Reagan , who had fired striking air traffic controllers in 1981 . Hedges ' game plan was first to make the rank and file feel like a union , then prepare them to take a stand and maybe even strike . The plan turned out to be a prudent one . Early in the morning of November 18 , the contract talks , which had been going on for 13 months , broke down . Hedges ' hope that the two sides could close a deal evaporated when she got her first glimpse of the company 's final terms . None of the union 's substantive demands had been met . The issues of pay , benefits , scheduling , and staffing had not been resolved . Particularly galling was the failure of the company to close the wage gap between junior and senior attendants . " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take a concessionary agreement out to our members , " Hedges warned the company 's bargaining team . The company stood firm . Unrelenting , Hedges announced , " There 's no way we can reach agreement . " Shortly thereafter , she broke the news to the 12 other members of the negotiating committee , assembled in a nearby " war room . " All agreed that a strike was the union 's only option . " I did n't want to be here at this spot calling a strike , " Hedges told waiting reporters . " But I feel we were forced into it and had no alternative . " At 6 A.M. central time American flight attendants walked off airplanes and away from sign-in stations at all 176 airports served by American , and they picketed at 95 . In the early hours of the strike , Hedges had no way of knowing that more than 90 percent of the attendants would actually stand by her , especially since the company had threatened to replace striking workers . At a time when unions have been weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women of the APFA showed themselves to be skillful strategists . Before the talks broke down on the 18th , Hedges announced that if she called a strike , it would coincide with Thanksgiving weekend , the busiest travel time of the year . Hedges also planned to limit the strike to no more than 11 days , so the company would not have time to hire and train replacements . Another shrewd tactic was to reject an offer by pilots to strike with the attendants . Hedges felt that the attendants ' strike was in part a strike for respect and would carry more weight without the participation of the powerful , primarily male pilots . She also let the company underestimate the union 's strength . American 's mostly male executives made the mistake of assuming that the women on their airplanes  --  with their " perfect " hair , makeup , earrings , and weight  --  would n't fight back . The attendants ' strike was a public relations nightmare for the nation 's largest carrier . The company told passengers the planes would fly , staffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with passengers  --  left the ground . The attendants had virtually shut down the airline , the first time they had ever flexed such muscle . The union 's public relations strategy  --  Hedges had hired a Washington , D.C. , public relations firm , specializing in labor  --  was so effective that even when passengers were displaced , they tended not to direct their anger at the flight attendants . Richard Hurd , a Cornell University expert on labor organizing , said that management came across as tough and unyielding , while the attendants , who had shown their good faith by asking a third party to intervene , emerged as reasonable . The company 's public relations machine , meanwhile , was trying to convince union members that the offer was fair and also vital to keep American competitive with low-cost carriers . The company promised workers they would be protected if they crossed the picket line . Five days into the strike , the third party , who turned out to be President Clinton , brokered a deal in which both sides would submit their differences to binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Crandall had earlier refused . Just the day before , the union had also suggested calling on a presidential emergency board , another third-party option that Crandall had rejected . But with American losing millions a day and with the prospect of chaos during the peak Thanksgiving travel period , Crandall finally agreed to arbitration . By the end of five days , American had been hurt , losing $160 million and approximately 1.3 million passengers . Though a final settlement may not be reached until May , the flight attendants  --  a group traditionally taken for granted  --  had won . In Hedges , who has a degree in anthropology , organized labor has a new face very different from the old industrial union boss . Yesterday 's typical union member was male , blue collar , and high school educated . Today 's is increasingly female and college educated . Heidi Hartmann , director of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research in Washington , D.C. , is coauthor of a recent study showing that women make up 37 percent of the nation 's union members  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet they make up only 8 percent of union officials , a situation that Hartmann predicts will change as women begin to feel the strength that comes with growing numbers . Says Hartmann : " This strike shows what women can do when they lead unions . " Rose Ciotta is a reporter and writer with the Buffalo " News . " <p>
