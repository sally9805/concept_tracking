Walks Into Context is everything . Dress me up and see . I 'm a carnival barker , an auctioneer , a downtown performance artist , a speaker in tongues , a senator drunk on filibuster . I 've got Tourette 's . My mouth wo n't quit , though mostly I whisper or subvocalize like I 'm reading aloud , my Adam 's apple bobbing , jaw muscle beating like a miniature heart under my cheek , the noise suppressed , the words escaping silently , mere ghosts of themselves , husks empty of breath and tone . ( If I were a Dick Tracy villain , I 'd have to be Mumbles . ) In this diminished form the words rush out of the cornucopia of my brain to course over the surface of the world , tickling reality like fingers on piano keys . Caressing , nudging . They 're an invisible army on a peacekeeping mission , a peaceable horde . They mean no harm . They placate , interpret , massage . Everywhere they 're smoothing down imperfections , putting hairs in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counting and polishing the silver . Patting old ladies gently on the behind , eliciting a giggle . Only -- here 's the rub -- when they find too much perfection , when the surface is already buffed smooth , the ducks already orderly , the old ladies complacent , then my little army rebels , breaks into the stores . Reality needs a prick here and there , the carpet needs a flaw . My words begin plucking at threads nervously , seeking purchase , a weak point , a vulnerable ear . That 's when it comes , the urge to shout in the church , the nursery , the crowded movie house . It 's an itch at first . Inconsequential . But that itch is soon a torrent behind a straining dam . Noah 's flood . That itch is my whole life . Here it comes now . Cover your ears . Build an ark . " Eat me ! " I scream . * * * " Maufishful , " said Gilbert Coney in response to my outburst , not even turning his head . I could barely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truthful and a joke , lame . Accustomed to my verbal ticcing , he did n't usually bother to comment . Now he nudged the bag of White Castles in my direction on the car seat , crinkling the paper . " Stuffinyahole . " Coney did n't rate any special consideration from me . " Eatmeeatmeeatme , " I shrieked again , letting off more of the pressure in my head . Then I was able to concentrate . I helped myself to one of the tiny burgers . Unwrapping it , I lifted the top of the bun to examine the grid of holes in the patty , the slime of glistening cubed onions . This was another compulsion . I always had to look inside a White Castle , to appreciate the contrast of machine-tooled burger and nubbin of fried goo. kaos and control . Then I did more or less as Gilbert had suggested -- pushed it into my mouth whole . The ancient slogan Buy ' em by the sack humming deep in my head , jaw working to grind the slider into swallowable chunks , I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food really mellows me out . We were putting a stakeout on 109 East Eighty-fourth Street , a lone town house pinned between giant doorman apartment buildings , in and out of the foyers of which bicycle deliverymen with bags of hot Chinese flitted like tired moths in the fading November light . It was dinner hour in Yorktown . Gilbert Coney and I had done our part to join the feast , detouring up into Spanish Harlem for the burgers . There 's only one White Castle left in Manhattan , on East 103rd . It 's not as good as some of the suburban outlets . You ca n't watch them prepare your order anymore , and to tell the truth I 've begun to wonder if they 're microwaving the buns instead of steaming them . Alas . Taking our boodle of thusly compromised sliders and fries back downtown , we double-parked in front of the target address until a spot opened up . It only took a couple of minutes , though by that time the doormen on either side had made us -- made us as out-of-place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the " T " - series license plates or stickers or anything else to identify it as a Car Service vehicle . And we were large men , me and Gilbert . They probably thought we were cops . It did n't matter . We chowed and watched . Not that we knew what we were doing there . Minna had sent us without saying why , which was usual enough , even if the address was n't . Minna Agency errands mostly stuck us in Brooklyn , rarely far from Court Street , in fact . Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill together made a crisscrossed game board of Frank Minna 's alliances and enmities , and me and Gil Coney and the other Agency Men were the markers -- like Monopoly pieces , I sometimes thought , tin automobiles or terriers ( not top hats , surely ) to be moved around that game board . Here on the Upper East Side we were off our customary map , Automobile and Terrier in Candyland -- or maybe in the study with Colonel Mustard . " What 's that sign ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town house doorway . I looked . " ' Yorkville Zendo , ' " I read off the bronze plaque on the door , and my fevered brain processed the words and settled with interest on the odd one . " Eat me Zendo ! " I muttered through clenched teeth . Gilbert took it , rightly , as my way of puzzling over the unfamiliarity . " Yeah , what 's that Zendo ? What 's that ? " " Maybe like Zen , " I said . " I do n't know from that . " " Zen like Buddhism , " I said . " Zen master , you know . " " Zen master ? " " You know , like kung-fu master . " " Hrrph , " said Coney . And so after this brief turn at investigation we settled back into our complacent chewing . Of course after any talk my brain was busy with at least some low-level version of echolalia salad : Do n't know from Zendo , Ken-like Zung Fu , Feng Shui master , Fungo bastard , Zen masturbation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now , not with White Castles to unscrew , inspect and devour . I was on my third . I fit it into my mouth , then glanced up at the doorway of One-oh-nine , jerking my head as if the building had been sneaking up on me . Coney and the other Minna Agency operatives loved doing stakeouts with me , since my compulsiveness forced me to eyeball the site or mark in question every thirty seconds or so , thereby saving them the trouble of swiveling their necks . A similar logic explained my popularity at wiretap parties -- give me a key list of trigger words to listen for in a conversation and I 'd think about nothing else , nearly jumping out of my clothes at hearing the slightest hint of one , while the same task invariably drew anyone else toward blissful sleep . While I chewed on number three and monitored the uneventful Yorkville Zendo entrance my hands busily frisked the paper sack of Castles , counting to be sure I had three remaining . We 'd purchased a bag of twelve , and not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also knew he was pleasing me , tickling my Touretter 's obsessive-compulsive instincts , by matching my number with his own . Gilbert Coney was a big lug with a heart of gold , I guess . Or maybe he was just trainable . My tics and obsessions kept the other Minna Men amused , but also wore them out , made them weirdly compliant and complicit . A woman turned from the sidewalk onto the stoop of the town house and went up to the door . Short dark hair , squarish glasses , that was all I saw before her back was to us . She wore a pea coat . Sworls of black hair at her neck , under the boyish haircut . Twenty-five maybe , or maybe eighteen . " She 's going in , " said Coney . " Look , she 's got a key , " I said . " What 's Frank want us to do ? " " Just watch . Take a note . What time is it ? " Coney crumpled another Castle wrapper and pointed at the glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six forty-five . " I popped the compartment -- the click-release of the plastic latch was a delicious hollow sound , which I knew I 'd want to repeat , at least approximately -- and found the small notebook inside . GIRL , I wrote , then crossed it out . WOMAN , HAIR , GLASSES , KEY . 6:45 . The notes were to myself , since I only had to be able to report verbally to Minna . If that . For all we knew , he might want us out here to scare someone , or to wait for some delivery . I left the notebook beside the Castles on the seat between us and slapped the compartment door shut again , then delivered six redundant slaps to the same spot to ventilate my brain 's pressure by reproducing the hollow thump I 'd liked . Six was a lucky number tonight , six burgers , six forty-five . So six slaps . * * * For me , counting and touching things and repeating words are all the same activity . Tourette 's is just one big lifetime of tag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoints me it , again and again . So I tag back . Can it do otherwise ? If you 've ever been it you know the answer .
