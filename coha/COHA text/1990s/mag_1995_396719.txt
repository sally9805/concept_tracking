What are they doing here ? And why are they letting themselves lose all that money ? Money means a lot to them back home . Why does n't money mean anything to them in Las Vegas ? They ca n't all have personality disorders ( or can they ? ) . They look normal enough  --  " normal " as defined not psychologically but statistically : middle class , mostly white , many of them overweight ( no matter their age ) , and wearing the sort of clothes you see in supermarkets and malls . Demographics say that roughly half their marriages end in divorce ; that the fathers spend less than 10 minutes a week in conversation with their children ; and that 20 percent of their teenagers have n't talked to either parent for more than 10 minutes in the last month . If they are couples , it 's statistically likely that both work and that on weekdays they spend an average of only 20 minutes " alone together , " as the old song put it . They work that hard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they feel they do n't have enough money . The vast majority of them share the same attitude toward money : a pervasive , potent mix of acquisitiveness and insecurity . Few , no matter what their financial standing , feel they have enough , and most feel they have nowhere near enough . They are people for whom job security is a thing of the past , and , if they are under 50 , they have good reason to fear that Social Security will be drying up by the time they retire . To them , taxes ( even for their children 's schools ) are anathema , and most want the government to balance its budget . They want to slash federal programs , especially welfare ( though it 's only three percent of federal spending ) , because , they tell pollsters , they hate people getting something for nothing . Yet ostensibly that 's why they come to Vegas : on the chance that they can win a lot of money and get something for nothing . Still , gambling is of best a puzzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we accept occasional gambling as a form of " entertainment , " there an casinos and lotteries all over the country now . If money is their most prominent personal as well as political concern , why make an expensive trip to stay in a a pricey hotel that ( despite the pools and shows ) is really a gambling den , where the odds are decidedly with the house , and where there 's little to do but gamble , drink , eat , and see scantily dad people sing and dance ? We know that , next to money , they 're worried about crime  --  so why come to a city where homicides are 56 percent higher than the national average , and rapes and robberies 17 percent higher ? Something unusual , even bizarre , is going on in Las Vegas . These people check in at the Luxor , a black pyramid with Nile River gondola rides , depictions of ancient deities , and a surreal mix of Egyptian and Manhattan decor ... or the Excalibur , a cinder block and fiberglass monstrosity supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights and ladies fair ... or the MGM , where you walk in through the open mouth of a giant lion and the cast of The Wizard of Oz greets you at the door ... or the Mirage , with live tigers through one entrance and sharks swimming in a huge tank behind the check-in desk .. or the new version of Bugsy Siegal 's old Flamingo , with its great pink flashing neon ... or Circus Circus , where trapeze acts soar over your head . They check in , these demographically normal people , leave their gear in rooms that ( except for the most expensive ) are basic Holiday Inn-type quarters , and take the nearest elevator down to the casino . They 'll spend most of their time in the casino , losing money . No matter what the decor , these casinos are very much the same . Hundreds and hundreds of slot and video poker machines fill every available space , ringing , buzzing , flashing . Mazes of them surround what are called " the tables "  --  tables used mostly for blackjack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner , usually roped off , there 's a section for poker and baccarat . Most of the casinos also have a " sports room , " where you may bet on any game being played anywhere . The vast majority of these demographically average visitors ( who would never call themselves gamblers ) prefer the slots and video poker . They plant themselves at these machines , and spend most of their time pouring money in  --  to the tune of billions a year . Twenty-two million people have to lose only $45.46 each to equal one billion , give or take a few pennies , and it 's not uncommon to lose that much in an hour or less . At home these same people  --  it can not be overemphasized  --  would drive many miles to save that much money shopping . They do not look like they 're having a good time  --  especially for people who 've come so far to , ostensibly , have exactly that . Watch their faces and what you see , with few exceptions , is actually a single face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is almost a stare , as they mechanically , rhythmically drop coins into the machines . At the roulette tables the expression is almost the same , with the grimness soured almost to glumness as the wheel rejects their numbers again and again . ( It 's hard not to take that personally . ) The blackjack tables are just slightly more animated . Only at craps do people seem to get excited , yell , cheer , moan , applaud  --  but craps is intimidating , and few play . Most remain at the slots . They take breaks to eat , many queuing up on lines for a half hour and longer to save money at a $5 buffet . This behavior is difficult to understand , since before and after eating they 're willing to lose those same five dollars in minutes or even seconds at the games . Or they 'll go to a show . Or lie in the sun by the pool ( not so pleasant in a place that is often more than 100 degrees in the sun ) . Or they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mirage , or the full-scale pirate ships ( complete with actors ) battle in front of Treasure Island . And , especially after dark , they 'll walk up and down Las Vegas Boulevard , known as the Strip , with the same set expression that they have at the slots , staring , staring , staring , at each other , at the neon , at the shadows of the desert mountains , and walking in and out of the casinos , where they lose more money . Since there are slot and video poker machines in virtually every drugstore , liquor store , supermarket , restaurant , bar , and souvenir shop  --  even at the airport  --  they lose money everywhere they turn . It is as though they are on automatic pilot , programmed to lose that which they most want . But it is not enough to note their passivity , for nothing could be less surprising than the passivity of a people who , statistically , spend nearly half their leisure hours watching TV . It would be surprising if they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these people mill together on a sidewalk waiting for an artificial volcanic eruption , or take photos in front of larger-than-life scenes from The Wizard of Oz  --  that they are subservient to spectacle . Most people , in most societies , have been equally subservient to their respective spectacles , gawking at any distraction no matter how little sense it made . Nor are their grim faces , ever-so-slightly frightened and just a hint angry , very unusual ; you can see the same expression on people walking the average city street . Even what can only be called their tastelessness is n't unusual ; after all , whatever else you can say about American culture , elegant it 's not . ( What we lack in elegance we usually make up for in energy . ) What is fascinating and unusual about these people , when compared to how they spend their time elsewhere , is their complete abandon to the act of throwing away money  --  money that in Las Vegas brings little in return except the act of throwing it away . For most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anything , it seems a determined and often even a cranky abandon . But it is abandon . They know what they 're doing , and they do it with an almost frenetic ( though also somehow glum ) energy , and they 've come a long way and planned a long time to do it . There is little evidence of the passion that ( for me , at least ) makes abandon worthwhile , but there is every evidence of the quality without which abandon can not exist : fatalism . There are few things more un-American in style than fatalism . People came to America to create " a city on the hill , " based on a religious faith in progress . American politics , industry , and culture are fueled by this optimism . The GNP must increase , and life must get better and better . No other culture feels this as passionately as ours ; no other bases its sense of well-being on such optimism . In America , to be fatalistic is to be seen as dour , depressed . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for our great solitary novelists like Melville , Faulkner , Hemingway  --  but these are often suspect in the eyes of the people at large . Though we seem to have less and less to be optimistic about , people who question the national optimism are seen as a threat . So for average Americans to come a far distance to indulge , albeit not very consciously , in fatalism , particularly fatalism about money , is a phenomenon found on a mass scale nowhere but Las Vegas . For it 's not as though these people do n't , on some level , know what they 're doing . They 're not stupid , after all . People who routinely operate the most complex technological culture in history can not be considered stupid . They know the odds are with the house . They know that losing here is far more common than winning . And most of them have been here before . Las Vegas could n't be profitable if people came only once ; our population is n't large enough yet for that . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often is a terrible comment on the dullness of their daily lives , but this does n't begin to explain the fatalism of regularly visiting Las Vegas . They work terribly hard for their money , they know they are almost certainly going to lose some of that money in Las Vegas , and they come anyway . The questions , then , are : What does money mean to them , what does n't it mean , and what do they want it to mean ? Of course , they come hoping to win money , a lot of money . A small percentage do win , and an even smaller number win big . They hope to win but , since they are not stupid , they expect to lose . It 's dear that the slim chance that they 'll win is the psychological mechanism by which they give themselves permission to lose , letting themselves lose without feeling like utter fools . In other words , the slim hope of winning is their door into the fatalism of losing . For is n't what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States money is our common denominator . It is the absolute standard of access and status  --  the " bottom line , " as we say these days . Not only commerce but education , justice , art , the environment , health care , and often liberty itself must meet the standards and bow to the demands of money . There is precious little among us that is n't rationed , administered , and ultimately valued , in terms of money . The Constitution aside , most Americans consider themselves free insofar as they have access to money . The " American dream " has come to mean an ideal not of liberty but of prosperity . Our unconscious or half-conscious definition of liberty has become " prosperity . " Contemporary politics is based on this equation . Most of our lives revolve around making money ( as opposed to the human , communal value of our work , which was the standard for many eras ) , and most of us judge ourselves according to what we can show for our money . In America money is , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert , even insidious , roles in our most intimate relationships . Divorcees who vie viciously for each other 's money are only bringing to light what lived in their love from the beginning : the need to be valued  --  a need that tends to turn ferociously concrete when things go bad . Our secrecy about our salaries is a secrecy about how we are valued . Among men especially , the contest of who will pick up the check is a contest of dominance , and this is only one of the gentler ways men make money felt in their friendships . It is no wonder that these people are grim as they not so much lose but leave their money in Vegas . Every dollar they sacrifice to the " games " is sticky with the pain of so much that is unadmitted and oppressive in their lives . Thus losing money in Las Vegas is more a ritual than it is anything else . For when we sacrifice something important and painful , even when it is against our practical interests to do so , and sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we are in the realm of ritual . If this ritual were conscious , if it were a choice , it might bring release , relief , and even happiness . But though these people make a choice to come here , and they know they 'll likely lose , the ritualistic aspect of their behavior is hidden beneath countless layers of habit , denial , and a kind of conditioned blindness . ( Psychotherapy would n't exist if people did n't hide their major motives from themselves most of the time . ) Since the ritual itself , as with so much about money , is unadmitted  --  repetitive , compulsive , and enacted in a setting that advertises it self as fun  --  there is a terrible tension in it , as there is in any action the wellsprings of which can not be acknowledged , or any rebellion that is doomed to fail . They come to Las Vegas to rebel against the oppression of money and to escape how they 've surrendered their spirits so completely to money 's laws and demands . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a veritable maze of money , a city that exists to do nothing but suck money from them and that gives virtually nothing back in return . Their rebellion against money plays into others ' lust for money . They sense this , and thus the futility of their rebellion is total . They are , in Las Vegas lingo , " suckers . " And there is no way to be proud of being a sucker , or to feel when being suckered that one is somehow also being released . To be compelled to come here , and to submit so completely ( though not very consciously ) to being a sucker , is to take a vacation into defeat . It is the final victory of the daily grind over the seeking spirit , an unacknowledged submission to all the ways that money causes pain . Thus it is a ritual that defeats and trivializes itself precisely because it is so unconscious . So for all its glitter , neon , and supposed gaiety , a depression hangs in the desert air over Las Vegas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has one of the highest suicide rates in the world to feel death in the air . You do n't need to remember that this city lies in the midst of the Mojave Desert , susceptible to earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault not 150 miles away  --  a city with lax building codes and thus more vulnerable to quakes than Los Angeles . ( A major earthquake 's disruption of power , water , and transportation in the 100-plus-degree heat would leave its million-plus inhabitants and visitors dead in days . ) You do n't have to think of the sexual desperation in a place where prostitutes are listed in the Yellow Pages ( as " escorts " ) and where naked women and " boylesque " shows are advertised everywhere . You do n't have to listen to stars who croon love songs in the midst of all this lovelessness . You do n't have to attend the massively hyped boxing matches where men pound at each other to satisfy the frenzy of bettors . You do n't have to think much , do n't have to analyze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them you 'll see the appalling cost we pay for the dominance of money  --  how it has seeped into our spirits , our psyches , so much so that we come to Las Vegas to both wallow in and exorcise its power . These things can not be done at the same time , so it is a helpless attempt . And that , finally , is what these faces broadcast : helplessness  --  the expression of people who do n't really know what they 're doing but feel compelled to do it anyway . If this sounds extreme  --  well , that too fits Las Vegas . It is hard to imagine a city more extreme , more overt , more in the grip of compulsions . It is hard to imagine a place exposing its psychology more nakedly , under the garish tints of its neon . It used to be that Vegas made a kind of sense . At the end of World War II it was a tiny desert gambling town that few knew of and fewer cared about . Here , in 1946 , Bugsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three decades the gangsters held sway , while the city grew in population and fame . Gangsters , almost by definition , have contempt for society , for normal life . Their very existence is an expression of that contempt , and they built this city in their own image . Its garishness , its sexuality , and especially its " play , " the games not of chance but of odds that sucked money from all who came here , reflected their temperament , their values , and above all their secret . That secret , the core of their contempt for society , was simply this : that they could not exist , and certainly could not profit , unless supposedly normal people desired what they offered  --  desired to escape from a moral code they could not live without but could not entirely live within . The town made a kind of sense because it seemed aware of its purpose , its secret ; and it was small and private and , in its way , rather sophisticated . No one walked into a casino casually . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their fashions and manners suggested that they had come to do something special : transgress . The ritual was almost conscious . By the mid-1970s the place had grown too big , and was too much in the public eye , to be run overtly by gangsters . Corporations began to take over the casinos . Gradually they 've come to call their hotels " resorts , " not casinos ; and they refer to what goes on there as " gaming , " not gambling . The gangster casinos used to be is dimly lit ; the corporate casinos tend to be bright . The gangster casinos were openly , even proudly , sexy and sly in atmosphere ; the corporate casinos hide behind The Wizard of Oz , circuses , knights . People used to enter a casino formally ; now they wear the same outfits they wear to their hometown malls . The corporations are in effect saying , " It 's all right to do this , it 's good clean fun , nothing to feel shady about . " The gangsters " Las Vegas liked feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Las Vegas denies shadiness in their decor while offering it in their services . The city is as up-front as it ever was , for it can deny neither its purpose nor its psychology ; but the people it draws are less upfront , pretending they 're doing something quite in keeping with the way they normally live while doing things , especially with money , that they would never normally do . The toll this takes is seen in their pleasureless faces . A gangster 's rebellion is evident , and their casinos invited license and rebellion . A solid citizen 's unconscious rebellion is torture . The solid citizens have come to Las Vegas to defile the very thing that , in their own eyes , makes them solid : money . As in the old Las Vegas , they do here what they ca n't do elsewhere ; but unlike the old Las Vegas , they do it furtively , rarely looking at each other , each alone in front of their machine , pretending to attempt to win what they are almost certain to lose : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave for and that gives them the small freedoms that excuse their slavery . Every nickel , every dollar , is alive with pain here . Here the American dreamer is the American sucker . Here , in the last truly wide-open and wild town of the Wild West , everything we 've paid so dearly for is stripped bare , our dark side gleams in a neon glow , and we leave finally exhausted by our own helplessness  --  trying to put the best face on it , telling each other we 've had a good time  --  and usually broke . We go back home , and settle back into the grind of making the money that we 've just lost  --  back to spending 20 minutes a day with our spouses , talking 10 minutes a week with our kids , and accumulating enough money to vacation again in Las Vegas . <p>
