<p> Walking into the East Building of the National Gallery of Art is always such a pleasure . You know what is coming , yet it never fails to come as a surprise . <p> There is the big gateway flanked by two huge towers and then the shadowy compressed space just inside the door , with those deep triangular concrete coffers overhead , and then the opening to bounteous light . On bright mornings , the shadows of the skylight 's great steel triangles carve dark gullies into the pink marble of the west wall ; on gray days the whole big room with its fantastical bridges seems to hum all over with soft light . Visitors walk across the bridges and climb the welcoming stairs  --  people are at home in this room , for despite its immensity , it is formed to human dimension . <p> The splendid atrium and indeed the entire building seem somehow effortless and inevitable even though the geometry is unconventional . The legend of the building 's architecture lends credence to this impression . I.M. Pei , the architect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago with Paul Mellon and J. Carter Brown , doodled the trapezoidal shape of the site on a scrap of paper , and then drew a diagonal line through the shape from corner to corner , dividing it into two triangles , and there you had it : a masterpiece of modern architecture ! <p> This actually happened . Like the ancient Egyptians , the Italians of the Renaissance and many a modern architect , Pei believes the soul of architecture lies in geometry . On the plane , where he mused about the challenge of the National Gallery commission , the architect started quite naturally with the unusual shape of the lot on Pennsylvania Avenue . And then instantaneously came that dividing diagonal line  --  it truly was the genesis of the East Building , and you can see its echo still today in matters large and small , in the very shape of the building and in the paving stones of its floor . <p> As Pei biographer Carter Wiseman observed , this was " a classic ' back-of-an-envelope ' moment "  --  a creative mind in restless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to a complex problem . Pei 's decision to divide the site into two triangular segments did indeed contain the seeds of the finished product . <p> The reason is , it solved two major problems . In the first place , the geometry turned a negative of the site  --  its off-center relationship with John Russell Pope 's neoclassical mother ship across Fourth Street  --  into a positive . The most memorable feature of the building 's exterior  --  that prowlike tower that seems to aim itself directly at the central door in the west facade of Pope 's temple  --  evolved from this early site plan . <p> Second , the plan responded directly to the requirement for two separate and very different institutions  --  the National Gallery itself , devoted to the exhibition of art , and the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts , devoted to scholarship . From the very beginning , Pei intended the larger triangle for gallery use , and the smaller triangle for the study center . <p> And yet getting from there to here , from the striking first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a struggle . It was , in fact , much less a matter of individual inspiration than one of months of ceaseless trial and error  --  lots of little inspirations , perhaps , on the part of Pei himself and the talented team he assembled to work on the design . <p> On the occasion of the great building 's 20th anniversary  --  it was dedicated in June 1978 , 10 years after Pei 's productive airplane ride back to New York  --  the National Gallery has organized a compact exhibition of archival materials related to the Pei team 's patient search for perfection . On view in the lobby of the East Building auditorium , the show includes a 1971 scale model of the almost-final design , a couple of Pei 's early sketches , drawings by team members testing different ideas , and finished architectural renderings by Paul Stevenson Oles . <p> The search was patient , yes , but very exciting , and the exhibition lets you grasp something of the intensity and immediacy . One of the Pei sketches , for instance , shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a panorama of his unbuilt building , the eastern end of the Mall and the Capitol with its dome . The hastiness of the sketch is apparent not only in the speed of its scribbled lines but also in Pei 's choice of paper  --  the drawing was made on the back of a receipt from a glass and mirror company . Water stains blur some of the red ink . <p> A note written in a delicate hand on another drawing tells much about the teamwork on the project  --  and about the ultimate arbiter . The drawing , in black pen on tracing paper , shows a row of windows on top of the immense cross beam of the building 's west elevation . The unnamed author of the idea calls it a " glass cornice " and writes , " Jim Freed Pei partner James Ingo Freed agrees with me on this  --  but feels that I.M. wo n't like it  --  will want to sheath it all in marble . " Obviously , since the glass cornice was not built , I.M. did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent his people back to the drawing board more often than not . As this little exhibition concisely demonstrates , the triangular solution initially caused as many problems as it solved . No one , including Pei himself , could quite visualize how the two triangles  --  separate buildings , in effect  --  would relate to each other . No one had a clue as to how people would move about in the buildings . Nobody could figure out how to fit decent gallery spaces behind the acute-angled corners of the large triangle . <p> Nor did anyone have much of an idea about what the triangles would look like in three dimensions . Or , rather , the team members seem to have had plenty of exceedingly bad ideas . One large sheet of tracing paper , for example , shows several versions of the all-important west facade with a cutaway corner and a huge pop-up skylight  --  a triangle , of course  --  that would definitively have marred the Mall with a shouting , look-at-me oddity . <p> Eventually , however , most of the vexing issues were resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , was the evolution of the atrium . The initial confusion started to ebb as soon as this space assumed its final position and shape  --  an immense triangle in the very center of the floor plan . <p> Predictably , then , this show 's most dramatic moments demonstrate how the atrium took shape in the architects ' minds . Pei and partners had the great good sense to hire Oles , then a young whiz of a draftsman , to make meticulous renderings of the atrium as it evolved , so that they could better see the implications of their designs . ( Today , this would be done on a computer . ) Between November 1970 and June 1971 , we see the great space and the breathtaking tetrahedral skylight taking form , becoming always more open . <p> The wonderful thing about this exhibition is that after you examine the drawings , you need simply to walk a few paces to be back inside the real thing . Today it still is a multilevel surprise and delight  --  one of the most dynamic , subtly scaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design for the National Gallery of Art is on view through Oct. 11 in the National Gallery of Art 's East Building auditorium .
