Traditional Western notions of what jewelry should be fail with the work of Kiff Slemmons . It does not sparkle ; there are no diamonds or other precious stones to convey its economic worth . And it is not necessarily comfortable to wear . If one regards Slemmons 's work as visual literature , however , its strengths leap to the fore . Like good poetry , it can be read on many levels . It pulls at the senses with imagery , rhythm and pattern while engaging the intellect with allusion and metaphor . Its double entendres provide humor , while paradox and irony take the " reader " to yet deeper levels . Slemmons seeks to broaden the function of jewelry and use its power to go beyond simple signals of status and tradition into ideas . Slemmons approaches her work from a deep love of language shaped by exposure to different cultures , and a proclivity for close examination of detail . Her father was the editor of a small-town newspaper in Iowa , and she loved the presses , the Linotype machines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hot metal turned into type . " Her mother was a pharmacist , and Slemmons was fascinated by the delicate tools and old scales she used , as well as by her mother 's collection of houshold antiques : " It was a visually rich environment that taught me many things about how diverse objects can interact and converse , both aesthetically and metaphorically . " Her parents also instilled a lifelong love of travel . Eventually , Slemmons studied in Paris at the Sorbonne for a year before returning to the University of Iowa to continue with comparative literature , French and Russian . When by the middle of her junior year she had finished the course work for her degree , a friend urged her to take art classes just for fun . She enjoyed them so much , she acquired the credits to graduate summa cum laude in French and art in 1968 . While Slemmons was still in school , she helped finance a trip to Mexico by fashioning simple earrings out of twisted wire and selling them . Only later did she recognize that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout the 1970s , she learned to make jewelry by looking , reading and doing . Her work was straightforward and decorative , though she discovered a fascination with ethnic jewelry and used it as her reference point , frequently incorporating old beads with the metal . By the early 1980s , however , the work began to frustrate her . I had always thought I would be working in a more scholarly way  --  writing or teaching  --  because I was interested in intellectual things . The jewelry was separate from that . In preparing for a 1984 show at the Traver Sutton Gallery in Seattle called " In the Name of Friends , " I realized either I had to do something else or change what I was doing in jewelry to involve more of me , more of what I liked to think about and learn . Because of her academic studies , Slemmons was inclined to regard cultural concepts as relative and subject to change with time . This freed her to counter Western notions of jewelry . Self-taught , she had fewer shoulds and don'ts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unsettling to some people , because jewelry is supposed to be of precious metals , " explains Slemmons . It became her way of opposing the status values of jewelry that she does not share . She also learned that she could use the power jewelry conveyed for other than decorative purposes . " Initially I thought I could n't explore philosophical or social issues through jewelry , but in time I had to do something that was more like writing poetry . But it was doing that visually rather than through language . " The exhibit " In the Name of Friends , " a series of individual commemorative works , was the result of these ruminations . Each piece incorporated imagery of personal events or passions in the lives of different friends . Paul , for instance , honored a photographer , known for his images of mathematicians ' blackboards , who had dreamed his sister was imprisoned by witches in an old house . Slemmons crafted a house-shaped locket with pointed roofs and a padlock on the door which , when opened , revealed not the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series as performing some of the functions of ethnic jewelry , such as being talismanic or powerful for the person it represented : " It interested me that it meant things on several levels . What if I made a piece for a particular person that were to serve him in some way ? It did n't matter if anyone else knew that was what I was doing or not . It was away of cracking me loose to approach the jewelry in a different way . " In 1991 Slemmons merged the concepts of commemoration and amulet in Protection , one of the best known of the works she has made to honor her artistic roots in ethnic jewelry . The piece is fashioned after the Plains Indians ' ceremonial breastplate of fine bones and leather . Instead of bones , Slemmons chose pencils for " what they would suggest in a poetic sense . " The result is layers of allusion to temporariness and erasure . The title Protection is ironic . The original breastplates were not functional either . They were thought of as armor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for us . How much do words protect us , or does writing things down protect us ? Or you can look at it another way , as the Native Americans not having written things down . You do n't have to say all of this goes with the piece , but I certainly thought about all these things . A second breastplate , Sticks and Stones and Word 1992 , explored these allusions further , as Slemmons realized that the names of the pencil companies alluded to Native American tribes and attributes . To emphasize the connection , she shaved off the yellow paint , leaving such words as " choice , " " empire , " " save , " " Mohican " and " Ticonderoga " highlighted . I began these pieces as a kind of homage to the originals , but in actually getting down to doing them , other things happened . That piece became very political , but I did n't say " I want to make piece of political jewelry . " It came about from looking into the originals and finding out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at old things can sometimes be construed as sentimental or lead to a cliched nostalgia . I try not to do that . I look at ideas that attract me and realize they are still alive . Connotation and allusion are the poetic gifts Slemmons brings to her work . She incorporated a ruler into the body of a fish brooch because " people always talk about how big their fish are . " In her pin Talk is Cheap , 1990 , the head of a bird is covered with tiny strips of overlapping newsprint , catching such phrases as " endangered species , " " bald eagles " and " very concerned " ; in its beak it holds a typewriter key with a question mark . This connection between material and metaphor was solidified for Slemmons in 1987 , when she started her best-known series , Hands of the Heroes . When someone asked Slemmons who her heroes were , she questioned friends about theirs and began exploring the concept in jewelry . Using a single hand shape for the background , she created a " portrait " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the Antarctic adventurer Roald Amundsen , the palm is covered in scratched Plexiglas " ice " ; in the center a silver globe , turned to show the Antarctic , is set off by directional arrows on the palm and fingers  --  all pointing north . One of the most difficult for Slemmons was the hand of Nelson Mandela , with a prison grate in its palm , a red figure behind bars  --  " I was worried about trivializing the situation . I did n't show it with the others at first , but finally did and eventually gave it to a South African playwright . Later I made another  --  with the bars open . " The hand motif has been a rich vein for Slemmons . In 1990 , for a Washington State Arts Commission exhibit traveling to schools , she created five sets of hands dealing with the ways we are expected to measure up  --  to self , friends , school , parents and the world  --  using rulers and other found materials for the fingers and palms . The right hand of Self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from mirror , so that it literally reflects the eye of the beholder . The hand is a metonymical symbol for Slemmons , representing her handwork in the crafts and the face that jewelry is tactile not only because it is worn , but because the hand must place it on the body . Knowing the jewelry will be in the hand pleases Slemmons ; she is attracted to its function away from as well as on the body . It 's like having a book in your hand  --  I like that distance , you know , turning the page , referring back . It 's there in hand . Whether the piece is uncomfortable or heavy does n't concern me so much as that it be sturdy enough to be passed around and handled . I do n't want it just to hang at a distance either on a wall or on a person . This exploration has extended to hand tools . The first piece of a series begun in 1995 appears not to be jewelry at all . A tiny silver toolbox , it is exquisitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trade  --  a protractor , a pencil tip , two erasers and a one-inch measure . When the box is open , a hinged end allows the tools to slide out one by one . These are hand tools , indeed  --  four rings , all of them usable : " Some people make stands for the jewelry , but for me it had to be more functional  --  in a sense , to have more functions . " Slemmons 's fascination with tools and function has led to her breaking down real machines and tools into materials that become references within her work . One year she disassembled a typewriter , using its letters and symbols for commentary , and its spools and key arms in brooches and necklaces . But by far her favorite found object has been the ruler , which , with its allusions to scale , reflects both a constant concern of jewelers and our cultural obsession with measurement . In her recent Allies series , 1994 , Slemmons set pieces of ruler into silver to form geometric , robotlike figures with broad shoulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These figures are large  --  seven by three inches  --  and heavy . Hinged to swivel at the waist and neck , the Allies possess multiple aspects . In some cultures human forms are worn as symbolic of protective ancestors . I see these as protectors of a different sort : they keep us company , but like real allies ( and maybe ancestors , too ) , they are neither constant nor dependable . They also make reference to the human need to constantly measure , to compete and to move from the unique to the conventional and back again . The insect on the figure 's shoulder Slemmons defines as " the Ally 's ally , " a form that , in the instance of Tool Man , 1994 , accommodatingly changes to a pair of calipers . Slemmons sees the insects as a reference to the falconry of medieval knights , but they are also another layered element , jewelry on jewelry that plays with scale while adding a touch of humor and a bit of a chill . It 's one thing to have a large bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the ideas in the Allies are intriguing , the depth of narrative layering works against Slemmons in this series . As Slemmons creates a series , she continually finds more layers and she plays on these in increasingly subtle ways . In the Allies , the references are difficult to grasp , in part because one must see the jewelry from all sides . But most viewers do not have the chance to contemplate these pieces , turn them over in their hands , know their titles . The " meanings " become hidden text . Here , in working against traditional notions of jewelry , Slemmons takes a risk that the message may be lost on the viewer . Furthermore , some of what Slemmons is saying with this series is paradoxical . Though she sees the Allies as connected to ancient Cycladic figurines , her use of oxidized silver , the hard edges of the geometrical figures and their template form refer to her fascination with machinery and even hint at mass production . Yet each piece in the series is unique , and the care with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand can do . The mixed message of the Allies perhaps grows out of Slemmons 's ability to see a multitude of possibilities as she goes deeper into the work , coupled with her desire as a poet to utilize every level of meaning . Paradox , she would assert , can also add an edge : " I like that something is n't what I thought it was . I think underlying it all is an interest in contradiction and in seeing that there is something beyond the immediate . " There are special rewards to be found , especially outside the series work , in Slemmons 's more gestural pieces , in which her cleverness and sense of humor immediately please us . At the same time , they often involve some of the most intricate craftsmanship . Alchemy , 1993 , for instance , is a necklace that spoofs man 's onetime belief that base metals could be turned into gold . Calipers , bellows , a boiling caldron with spouts , pipes and funnels , work their way around the piece , in the end producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveys the absurdity of this pursuit through the funkiness of the apparatus while ironically suggesting that we still hope for just such miracles from modern machines . In Isinglasses for Mica Man , 1993 , which fathered the geometric Allies , a Duchampian play is set up between title and piece as Slemmons exploits the sound of the other word for mica as well as reminding us of the material 's visual properties . Here a bulky , spiky-haired figure of slivered mica and silver is being fitted with icy spectacles by a dragonfly whose antennae form a smile on the man 's face . The glazed pond of his body makes a natural habitat for the many-lensed insect  --  the perfect optometrist to help Mica Man see ( through ) himself . Slemmons 's gift for grasping what materials can convey is complemented by her delight in exploiting what she finds to its fullest . ( Who else would think to use an entire cigar box  --  including hinges , clasp and paper seal  --  for a neckpiece celebrating virility ? ) With humor , irony , metaphor and allusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is willing to take it in hand , spend time in its company , let the conversation deepen . <p>
