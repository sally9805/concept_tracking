The inherent values , virtues and possible vices of the book are not the issue here . The process is. // FATHER RICHARD P. McBRIEN is well known to AMERICA readers , and indeed to many thousands more . He needs no introduction . Yet the two of us are constantly confused . Perhaps it is because we have written together on occasion . Or perhaps it is our similar Irish names . He was recently described , both in The South Bend Tribune and in Notre Dame 's student newspaper The Observer , as " a moral theologian at Notre Dame . " At least twice before lectures of mine I have been startled to hear the introducer conclude with " and so , please join me in welcoming Father Richard McBrien . " Father McBrien deserves the protection of distinction . Father McBrien , a priest of the Hartford Archdiocese , is the Crowley-O'Brien-Walter Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame . His special field is ecclesiology , not moral theology . He has authored 17 books , writes a weekly syndicated column for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and world affairs . In 1976 Father McBrien received the prestigious John Courtney Murray Award from the Catholic Theological Society of America , whose president he was in 1973-74 . Father McBrien 's books have always done well . His writing , like his speaking , is direct , clear and persuasive . For instance , of his 1987 book Caesar 's Coin : Religion and Politics in America , AMERICA 's editor in chief , George W. Hunt , S.J. , wrote : " This week I had the pleasurable chore of reading what will likely be the most important Catholic book of the decade " ( 3/28/87 ) . He noted the author 's expertise in theology and American political history . " The result , " Father Hunt stated , " is a work of exact , prudent scholarship and impressive erudition , written in lucid , persuasive prose . " But this is not the book that merits the title of this article . Our concern here is the third edition of his huge ( 1,334 p . ) Catholicism . This book first appeared as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-volume study edition in 1981 . The original edition was an immediate success . It received a Christopher Award and since then has sold 165,000 copies . It is worth noting that the book also caught the eye of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Doctrine . In 1981 the committee began what it described as " a constructive and fruitful dialogue " with Father McBrien , during which " Father McBrien has cooperated fully . " Indeed , it referred to the discussions as a " model of cooperative ecclesial concerns for the integrity of the faith . " After a number of meetings , the committee finally published its brief statement in 1985 ( Origins , 8/1/85 ) . It noted that Father McBrien had made a number of clarifications in the study edition and had expressed a readiness to make further changes . Still , the committee had concerns about the presentation of the virginal conception of Jesus , the perpetual virginity of Mary , the binding force of Marian dogmas and the lack of support for the church 's teaching on contraception and the ordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusing and ambiguous . " THERE , one would have thought , the matter ended . Not so . In a letter dated Nov. 15 , 1995 , Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco , then chairman of the Committee on Doctrine , called Father McBrien 's attention to the committee 's 1985 statement of " hope that subsequent editions will incorporate the clarifications necessary to remove any remaining ambiguities in the expression of Catholic teaching . " Archbishop Quinn then ominously noted that " both the Committee and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regret that our expectation has not been fulfilled in the third edition . " The letter ended with an invitation to meet and discuss these concerns " before the Committee makes public its continued concerns with some of the content of Catholicism . " In short , from the very beginning it was clear that the committee was going to go public on this third edition . Father McBrien answered Archbishop Quinn 's letter on Dec. 4 , 1995 , and asked whether " we are at the stage of " informal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The distinction is drawn from the bishops ' 1989 document " Doctrinal Responsibilities " ( Origins , 6/29/89 ) . This document was drawn up to promote collaboration between bishops and theologians , to forestall disputes and , if they arise , to promote their resolution . " Doctrinal Responsibilities " lays out quite concretely the rules and procedures of " formal doctrinal dialogue . " For instance , the first task of such dialogue is stipulated as " gathering the data . " Under this title the document states : " Adequate access to the record by both parties is essential to effective dialogue . In cases in which a dispute has arisen because of complaints or accusations by other persons , the party accused or complained against has the right of access to the materials sent by the other persons . " I shall return to this below . It was after that first shot across the bow that Archbishop Quinn took early retirement from San Francisco and was succeeded on the Committee on Doctrine by Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati . ON FEB. 8 , 1996 , Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Archbishop Quinn . He said that " the Committee feels that it will be necessary to issue a public statement about our concerns with Catholicism in the near future . " He then added that " the Committee does not feel that formal doctrinal dialogue is called for in this case since that has already taken place , prior to the Committee on Doctrine 's 1985 statement . " Father McBrien was invited to an " informal dialogue . " Father McBrien responded on Feb. 16 . He disagreed with the committee 's contention that a formal doctrinal dialogue had already occurred . The 1994 edition of Catholicism is , he urged , a completely revised and updated version involving between 25 and 30 percent new material . Father McBrien argued further that a negative public statement by the committee would have the force and effect of a monitum ( warning ) that would cast a dark shadow on his reputation . He pointed out that " Doctrinal Responsibilities " explicitly states that the theologian has the right to a good reputation " and , if needed , the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . " Clearly , Father McBrien did not judge that an informal one-hour chat followed by an extended negative public statement constitutes an " appropriate process . " Archbishop Pilarczyk responded on Feb. 23 . He enclosed a draft of the proposed public statement on Catholicism and stated that a formal doctrinal dialogue was not necessary because the proposed public statement was directed at points that had remained constant in all three editions of Catholicism . He then repeated his contention that a formal process had already occurred in the early 1980 's and that the proposed public statement " is simply the next moment in the process that began in 1981 . " If this appeared confused and incoherent to Father McBrien , it is no wonder . Archbishop Pilarczyk is arguing that what began in 1981 was a formal doctrinal dialogue . He further avers that the proposed publication of the Doctrinal Committee 's review " is simply the next moment in the process that began in 1981 . " One would think that the next moment in a formal doctrinal process shares in the formal character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties are already in a formal process . Yet the Archbishop urged that all that is needed is an informal discussion . This means that the Archbishop is asserting at one and the same time that what is now going on is the continuation of the formal doctrinal dialogue begun in 1981 and yet that no such formal dialogue is necessary . On March 4 Father McBrien responded at considerable length ( Origins , 4/18 ) . He requested that the process of formal doctrinal dialogue be employed before the publication of any review of the 1994 edition of Catholicism . He outlined his reasons as follows : I do so for the following reasons : ( 1 ) The original process of review undertaken by the Committee on Doctrine in the early 1980 's was not the same as that envisioned and specified by " Doctrinal Responsibilities . " ( 2 ) The 1994 edition of Catholicism is a " completely revised and updated " edition of the work originally reviewed by the Committee on Doctrine in the early 1980's. ( 3 ) The draft review prepared by the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either not part of the original review or not mentioned in the 1985 statement of the Committee on Doctrine . ( 4 ) The draft review misunderstands the nature and purpose of the book as a " catechetical manual " and " introductory text for young people . " And yet its central criticism and adverse pastoral judgment of the book is predicated largely on that assumption . ( 5 ) The Committee on Doctrine intends to undertake a formal action , i.e. , the issuance of a public statement on the book that will have the practical , if not canonical , effect of a monitum , without any antecedent formal process , as required by the letter , and certainly the spirit , of " Doctrinal Responsibilities . " Father McBrien then elaborated on each of these points in his letter . While all are substantive , I want to concentrate on the first . The process that began in 1981 was not carried on in accordance with the bishops ' 1989 guidelines . The guidelines did not then exist . Thus , Father McBrien had no access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by both parties ; until the very last meeting he was not given the right to be accompanied by advisers . These and other such conditions are explicitly laid down in the bishops ' recent guidelines . Therefore , the current situation is not " simply the next moment in the process that began in 1981 . " Archbishop Pilarczyk responded on March 22 ( Origins , 4/18 ) . In brief , he stated that it would be unnecessary and inappropriate to enter into the formal doctrinal dialogue outlined in " Doctrinal Responsibilities . " " To enter into formal dialogue at this time would in effect be to initiate an entirely new process of discussion and evaluation which we do not view as necessary . " Furthermore , the Archbishop argued , " Doctrinal Responsibilities " was designed principally as an instrument for dialogue between an individual theologian and his/her bishop . The final statement in this exchange was Father McBrien 's response of March 29 . He stated that the " five reasons I gave in support of this request for a formal doctrinal dialogue are valid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter of March 22 . " He argued that if " Doctrinal Responsibilities " applied to disputes between theologians and local bishops , a fortiori it must apply to disputes at higher levels . Indeed , Father McBrien confirmed that other bishops had supported his request for formal doctrinal dialogue . There the matter stands . The Committee on Doctrine made its critique public on April 9 ( Origins , 4/18 ) . FATHER McBRIEN stated in his final letter to Archbishop Pilarczyk that " the issue dividing us at this point is that of process . " Bishop John D'Arcy of Fort Wayne-South Bend asserted in his long statement in his diocesan newspaper Today 's Catholic ( 4/21 ) : " The issue is not the process . The issue is the serious pastoral and doctrinal concerns raised by the Doctrine Committee . " He later referred to these concerns as " the real issues . " With all due respect , I disagree with Bishop D'Arcy 's dismissal of the process as a non-issue . Fairness of process is always an issue , indeed the very first issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of episcopal rights and responsibilities , let me affirm here what I believe all theologians would admit , indeed insist on , about these responsibilities . 1 . All theologians would agree with the assertion in " Doctrinal Responsibilities " that the bishops " prime responsibility is preaching the word of God . 2 . They would further agree that bishops are charged to preserve and protect the truth of the faith . 3 . They would also agree that this protection and preservation might call for public pastoral statements of clarification or warning when the faith is endangered by influential written or spoken materials . 4 . When such materials emanate from a particular theologian , I believe all would agree that before pastoral warnings are issued , a fair process must be followed . This process is fully stated in " Doctrinal Responsibilities . " Father McBrien would accept the first three points without hesitation or qualification . It is the meaning of " fair process " that is the issue before the doctrinal issues are even approached . He asked for and was denied a formal doctrinal dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious doctrinal and pastoral concerns " mentioned by Bishop D'Arcy . In this sense , these concerns were not , or are not yet , the issue . " Doctrinal Responsibilities " explicitly states that a refusal of formal dialogue must " state the reasons for refusal . " Clearly , then , the unstated reasons directly affect the credibility and acceptability of the refusal . Otherwise , why insist on stating them ? If the reasons are inadequate or unpersuasive , the refusal is more or less arbitrary , and at some point unfair . Father McBrien has argued at considerable length and , I believe , very persuasively that the reasons put forth by the Committee on Doctrine are transparently weak . Earlier I argued that they are not merely weak but incoherent . Such weaknesses should have alerted the Committee on Doctrine that they were on extremely thin ice . IF THE REASONS adduced are so weak , why did the committee refuse the formal doctrinal dialogue ? We shall never know . We can only speculate . Here we encounter once again the disease of official secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good of the faithful " ) that so often poisons ecclesial life . It generates and nourishes dark suspicions . For instance , " Doctrinal Responsibilities " stipulates that in a formal doctrinal dialogue the party complained against " has the right of access to the materials sent by the other persons . " In other words , in such a dialogue Father McBrien has the right to know his accusers . Are there people with an interest in preventing this ? Does the committee have something to hide , or someone to protect ? Who complained to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and to the Committee on Doctrine ? If Catholicism is such a threat to the life of the church that it demands a detailed and quite negative public warning from the Committee on Doctrine , then clearly such implications for the life of the church should be easily verifiable . Were teachers who use the book consulted by the committee ? There is no evidence of it . Yet the bishops ' own guidelines in " Doctrinal Responsibilities , " when speaking of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes : " A discussion about implications can not be simply an exchange of personal impressions . It should clarify the criteria used by the parties to assess pastoral life . Conclusions should be based on adequate information required for prudential judgments . This may necessitate gathering additional evidence . " Once again , were the professors and students who use Catholicism consulted ? Without such evidence do we really have " adequate information required for prudential judgment " ? The Committee on Doctrine might have been aided in its deliberations had they consulted some of the reviews of Catholicism . For instance , the 1994 third edition received a first place award from the Catholic Press Association . The citation runs as follows : " Father McBrien has performed a wonderful service for all Catholics by completely revising and updating his 1980 book on Catholicism . By beginning each topic with the Bible and developing it historically , the author leads the reader to a fuller understanding of Catholicism and its continuing process of development . A sincere reader can not help but come away with a deeper appreciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book makes the reading of it a delight . The chapter summaries and discussion questions make it ideal as a teaching tool . This outstanding book is a " MUST " for all Catholics ! " Similar plaudits have come from all over the Englishspeaking world . For example , the renowned Msgr . George Higgins described the new edition of Catholicism as " one of the most important Catholic books published since Vatican II . " He added : " There is simply nothing comparable to it on the market " ( Catholic Messenger , 9/14/94 ) . But the inherent values , virtues and possible vices of the book are not the issue here . Pace Bishop D'Arcy , the process is . Father McBrien asked for and was denied a " formal doctrinal dialogue . " This is really a due process procedure set up by the bishops themselves . The very fact that the one with the most to lose asked for the formal dialogue is all but reason enough to grant it , especially in the United States , where we rightly pride ourselves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church exempt from these things , including its own guidelines ? Refusal to grant the formal procedure puts the committee-and unfortunately , but inevitably , all the bishops whose committee they are-in a quite unenviable position : They are willing to criticize publicly a widely acclaimed book by a very prominent theologian , with the inseparable harm to his reputation that this brings , without the very due process they themselves established for such cases . I can only conclude that fairness was not well served in L'Affaire McBrien . Perhaps that is why even some bishops themselves at the March meeting of the Administrative Board urged the Committee on Doctrine to grant Father McBrien 's request . THE 1971 SYNOD OF BISHOPS issued the statement " Justice in the World , " which contains the following : " While the Church is bound to give witness to justice , it recognizes that anyone who ventures to speak to people about justice must first be just in their eyes . Hence we must undertake an examination of the modes of acting and of the possessions and life style found within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their 1986 pastoral letter " Economic Justice for All . " They state : " All the moral principles that govern the just operation of any economic endeavor apply to the church and its agencies and institutions ; indeed the Church should be exemplary " ( emphasis in original text ) .
