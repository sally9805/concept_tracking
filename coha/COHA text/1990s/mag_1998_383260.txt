<p> ON April 4 , 1998 , the New York Times broke the story about the extensive military-related satellite business conducted in China by Loral Space and Communications , headed by CEO Bernard Schwartz , megadonor to the Democratic National Committee . It was a big , fast-unfolding story with all the right elements ' domestic and international political intrigue , national security , and money . <p> Like most of what counts as Big News at the big papers , the stow had impact because it presented all of these elements in a fresh , unfamiliar arena  --  in this case , the world of military contractors and their commercial relationships with potentially hostile foreign powers . Now , despite the considerable fallout from the Loral stow , one important question has gone unasked : Why was this subject unfamiliar ? And the answer is that for years , and especially since the end of the Gulf War , the big papers have done a rather poor job of covering national defense . As often happens , looking just a little beneath the surface of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day , in my work as the newspaper columnist for the online magazine Slate , I read the nation 's five biggest daily newspapers-the Los Angeles Times , the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , and USA Today . Probably the single biggest thing I 've learned in the job is this : Big News is n't always real news , and , often , real news does n't qualify as Big News . <p> This is , by the way , a little-noticed corollary of the Monica Lewinsky coverage . When polls surfaced showing that the American people were n't all that concerned about President Bill Clinton 's alleged dalliance , this was widely taken as a sign that his political future was n't nearly as imperiled as it had first appeared . But it was also a sign of something else . After all , the very same papers that carried those polls were spattered with Bill and Monica stories , many on the front page under bold headlines , served up with the dramatic prose reserved for Big News . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between ordinary people and the contemporary notion of political scandal  --  there 's also a gulf between ordinary people and what lands in their driveways every morning . <p> Take another example of a hot story tobacco . For the past few years , the papers have been breaking story after stow about the deceitful world of cigarette marketing . But for most of the 34 years since the government officially condemned cigarettes as harmful , newspapers did n't do the subject anything close to justice . Even though during that time , smoking-related illnesses decimated many an American family , the big dailies blithely ignored the cigarette manufacturers ' insidious ad campaigns , cash-heavy lobbying , and dubious science  --  all the while raking in cigarette advertising dollars themselves . It has been only within the past year or so that these papers have even taken to using the apt trust-busting phrase " Big Tobacco . " <p> In a media world that every day becomes increasingly frivolous , newspapers  --  the front sections at least  --  still represent themselves as bearers of important truths . But " important " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News varies from paper to paper . More surprising still , one paper 's lead often does n't even make the others ' front pages . One good example of such news ( in ) discretion : On May 8 , USA Today led with the Federal Aviation Administration 's order to inspect and repair many Boeing 737s , affecting 152 of the nation 's most common commercial airliners . The New York Times not only chose not to lead with the story ( it led with the Senate 's passage of IRS reform instead ) , it buried it on Page 20  --  freeing up space on Page One for a piece about what had killed the artificial turf at the New York Giants ' football stadium . <p> Journalists have many subjective preferences that can turn a stow into Big News : They tend to emphasize crisis over structure , new information over deeper information , personalities over institutions , process over product , and the elite over the middle class . Now , these preferences are important , but the distortion of Big News is that it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the big dailies cover defense . The annual defense budget  --  yeah , that 's covered . A war ? You bet . But when it comes to subtler issues such as Loral 's possible transfer of militarily sensitive technology to China , the papers have historically waited until it 's too late to do anything . <p> Crisis Certainly one of the main reasons Loral was able to fly under the Big News radar is that its transactions with China took place incrementally . There never was , in short , a Loral crisis . <p> Defense contractors have been selling sensitive military technology to potential U.S. adversaries in a big way since the end of the Cold War , but it 's only the whiff of political scandal that got the big papers interested . And like all scandals , this one , too , will go away , which all too often means that the papers will stop covering it , leaving the underlying problem relatively unexamined . <p> One of the reasons there 's no room for long-term coverage is that there 's so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I I write this , May 16 : The biggest story is the atom bomb tests in India ( and Frank Sinatra ) . The press roundly criticized the U.S. intelligence community for failing to warn that these tests were coming . Typical was the New York Times ' editorial , which argued that the policy folks at the State Department and the White House had fallen down on the job . Yet with the exception of the day before , the Times had n't run any front-page coverage of India for two weeks ; before that , no front-page India military stories had appeared for five weeks . Yes , the intelligence and the national security staffs are too readily distracted by the present crisis , but so are the newspapers . <p> Novelty Of course the root of the crisis syndrome is that , by convention , news has to be above all new . But why ? Once you let that go , lots of possibilities open up . Far more intriguing , for instance , than the dozens of stories on the record-high rates paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting on how those commercials affected product sales . <p> Last spring , in the wake of the death of Pol Pot , the New York Times ran a " Week in Review " piece by Philip Shenon about exiled leaders suspected of committing atrocities who are now living freely in the U.S. and other countries . The list included El Salvador 's former defense minister , Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia , and former national guard director , Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova , both believed by the U.N . to have attempted to cover up their government 's murder of three American nuns in 1980 . The article also mentioned Emmanuel Constant , the former head of a Haitian paramilitary group responsible for the murder and torture of thousands of Haitians in the early 1990s . In the course of the piece , Shenon reported that all three men live legally in the United States . Why was n't this Big News  --  a front-section , frontpage , or even lead story that day ? Shenon did n't say why the two El Salvadorans have n't been extradited , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe he can get a fair trial in Haiti ( thus ignoring the idea that Constant could be given a fair trial here , a la Noriega ) . The only explanation Shenon offers is " realpolitik , money , and simple laziness . " In other words , nothing much is happening with these men now , so in the journalism vernacular , there is no " peg " for the story . Is n't this beside the point ? Maybe the lack of new developments is the news , calling for a story about how the State Department , the Immigration and Naturalization Service , and the FBI fell down on the job . <p> Additionally , other papers neglected to pick up on the importance of this story , or they simply failed to cover it . That is the usual pattern : Until a story broken elsewhere reaches a level of impact so great that to ignore it would be to risk looking stupid , newspapers resist writing about stories that other papers have covered . They 'd rather find " new " news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbrew you do n't know about the following two stories : ( 1 ) Despite years of Pentagon denials of Gulf War Syndrome 's legitimacy , three months before the war , the Department of Defense prepared a report for the Air Force indicating that bombing Iraq 's chemical weapons facilities was " certain " to release deadly nerve gas ; and ( 2 ) U.S. officials have declared 20 Russian research organizations , from universities to intelligence agencies , ineligible for U.S. aid because they are suspected of having provided missile technology to Iran . <p> These stories are too important for you not to have heard about , would n't you say ? The reason they are news to you now rather than news to you then is that both were lead stories in USA Today . The first ran on August 14 , 1997 , and the second on April 16 , 1998 . But USA Today , despite its large national circulation and general quality , is inordinately ignored by its snobbish competitors , who especially do n't want to be seen chasing " McPaper " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best solution to the dailies ' novelty addiction is for them to engage in more of what media critic Paul H. Weaver calls the " routinization " of the news  --  giving prime page space over to deliberative , nonbreaking stories . The best current examples of this are the front pages of the Wall Street Journal and USA Today , and the Los Angeles Times ' " Column One . " In their own way , each of these tries to cut through the particulars of the immediate news cycle to get at a story 's lasting meaning . Another remedy would be to create a Pulitzer Prize for the best story in an unfairly ignored genre : follow-up . <p> Personality/Process/As Washington Monthly editor Charles Peters often notes , it 's a lot easier to do a story about Senator X and Senator Y jousting with each other over a mine-safety bill than it is to do one on mine safety . For the former , all you have to do is watch from the gallery and make some phone calls . For the latter , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't take as much skill to write an interesting story about the Senate 's conflict over a nomination for , say , secretary of defense as it does to write an interesting story about how the Pentagon is working under the guy once he 's had the job awhile . Conflict is inherently dramatic . The Pentagon is not . So the bias is understandable , but not without cost . Journalism 's fixation on personalities over process gives us , for example , too much information on politics and not enough on government , and too much on corporate moves and not enough on product and service performance . <p> A textbook example is the merger story , a staple front-section business article . The thoughts and feelings of the CEOs toward the move and each the most of the attention . For instance , in Journal 's May 8 report on the Daimler/Chrysler merger , you have to wade pretty far down to get to " revenues , " " purchasing outlays ; ' or " share-exchange ratios . " First you get the secret hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artful deflection of an outsider 's nosy question . There 's even , according to the Journal , an important shower scene . And of course , once the liaison is on the verge of consummation , there is the age-old question of whose name to take . " It was a very emotional issue at the end , emotional on both sides , " Daimler 's chairman is quoted as saying . These are n't business stories-they 're about how titans romance each other . Why does the ordinary reader need to know about that ? <p> Elitism There 's another reason for all this breathless reporting about CEO mating habits : To a profound degree , as a result of what James Fallows calls , in Breaking the News , journalism 's " status revolution ; ' reporters and editors at big newspapers now tend to identify with the upper class . This helps explain why , for example , personal finance coverage is ever expanding while aggressive reporting about corporate misdeeds is not . More likely than not , the effusive merger stories are written and edited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it all the easier for newspapers to forget that most Americans do n't own a single share . How else to explain why the New York Times interrupted one of its early stories on the bomb tests in India to note the impact the U.S. 's sanctions were having on the Bombay , New Delhi , and Madras stock markets ? <p> The money-class bias hurts other coverage as well . It contributes , for example , to the woeful underreporting on this country 's military leadership . During the Gulf War , the major dailies waited until just before the shooting started to file their first reports on the military leaders who , in a matter of hours , would hold the country 's fate in their hands ; and during the recent inspection dustups with Iraq , only the Journal bothered to profile Gen. Anthony Zinni , who would be the next Schwarzkopf if the balloon went up . Third-tier presidential candidates who concede the morning after New Hampshire get more ink than the folks with launching authority . <p> Reporters and editors downplay this area because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military themselves and have little feel for or interest in its activities or its mindset . So while journalists seem to find CEOs endlessly fascinating , they readily believe that service members are more or less indistinguishable from one another ( forgetting , if they ever knew , that Meade was no Grant and Paulus was no Rommel ) and , although they might hesitate to admit it , a little dense besides . Sometimes this leaks out : In that ( very good ) Journal profile of Zinni , reporter Thomas Ricks wrote that the paradigm for a Marine officer was to be a " knuckle-dragging intellectual . " <p> Similarly , although Ivy-educated , Lexus-driving reporters would never come out and say it , they must at some level believe the lives of servicemen are not worth much . How else to explain the minuscule coverage of defense procurement fraud ? Last May , a defense contractor was convicted in a fraud ease for selling defective parts for the arresting cable systems aircraft carriers use to catch planes as they land . If these cables fail , aircrews could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally get cut in half . Now it 's bad enough that the executive 's sentence was only three months in prison and three months of house arrest , but it 's inexcusable that the only big paper to cover the story was the New York Times , which buried its tiny piece deep in the metro section . Being willing to kill service members for a profit should be Big News . On similar grounds , it 's absurd that the exponential growth of sales by U.S. defense contractors to foreign governments gets so little coverage . The last five U.S. military actions have exposed U.S. troops to adversaries who had previously received U.S. weapons , military technology , or training . Where are the pieces in the Times and the Journal on this ? It 's precisely their absence that made the Loral story seem so stunning . <p> Selling military technology is too routine to cover <p> Personality over institutions <p> Press elitism is a serious obstacle because it erodes both the moral detachment that protects reporters from being lobbied onto or off of a story and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . Just as seriously , it promotes a kind of " great-man theory " in which reporters and editors do n't have to conform to the rules they apply to everybody else . <p> For all the attention paid by the papers to the Monica matter , which among them has ever fired a reporter or editor for adultery ? Or , more to the point still , has done so and then written about it ? Like all big papers , the Los Angeles Times thrives on the local corruption story . Its pages are a parade of contractors , city officials , and politicians with till-bound thumbs . Yet , recently , when it discovered that one of its own executives had embezzled nearly $800,000 from the paper , it did n't print a word about it until it was a matter of court record . <p> Newspapers are not going to become extinct anytime soon . The Internet will eventually be their salvation , because it promises the papers something that heretofore has both bedeviled and eluded them : television 's agility . Finally , newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Loral caper show that they still need to think harder about what to shine it on . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Picturing the news : The relative coverage or recent topi stores - 10 The Monica matter . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 2 For decades , papers ignored tobacco <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 4 Iraqi nerve gas story buried <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 7 Indistinguishing grunts <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 8 Procurement fraud ignored <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 3 Crisis coverage of India <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 6 Business titans romance each other <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : 9 Supplying our own enemies <p> by Scott Shuger <p> LASERS , SURVEILLANCE , AND MISSILES , OH MY ! All the defense industry news that 's too confusing to print <p> Since the end of the Cold War , the U.S. military has begun transforming itself into a leaner , more efficient fighting force . And the media has dutifully covered these changes . But the government still spends close to $300 billion each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of talk about a " revolution in military affairs , " there 's also a lot of doubt among observers on both sides of the ideological fence about the way the government plans to foment the revolution . <p> Within a few years , for example , the Army expects to end the production of its venerable M-1 Abrams tank , its primary attack helicopter , and its main infantry vehicle-all to save money . Meanwhile , the Air Force and Navy are planning to spend as much as $300 billion on three massive tactical aircraft programs now in development , including the so-called Joint Strike Fighter . Are they needed ? The General Accounting Office and Congressional Budget Office suggest one or more of the three programs could safely be delayed or canceled without any damage to U.S. security . Nonetheless , the government is pushing ahead with all three while planning to replace an existing fighter aircraft fleet that is by far the best in the world . <p> Andrew Krepinevich , a former Army lieutenant colonel and Pentagon analyst who now heads the influential Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not effectively addressing the matter of how and why the transformation will occur , and that few in Congress or the media are asking them the right questions . " ' Transformation ' means that you see the need to create a substantially different kind of military than we have today , yet it remains unclear what 's doing the transforming , " he says . <p> Carl Conetta , who runs the Cambridge , Mass. - based Project on Defense Alternatives , agrees . " The whole ' revolution in military affairs ' issue has not gotten beyond the ' gosh golly ' reporting ; ' he says . With a " scarcity of resources " for government spending , he adds , " we have to be careful that we do n't go chasing after just anything that comes along : ' <p> So what is the Pentagon chasing ? According to military leaders , the backbone of the coming revolution is something called information superiority . U.S. military and intelligence agencies plan to reap the benefits of the information age and are making massive investments in communications , electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks that allow tanks , planes , and even individual soldiers to share data . " The strategic center of gravity is shifting away from the ' big iron ' - planes and tanks and boats and satellites-to the critical , strategic information systems , " says John Pike , an analyst at the Federation of American Scientists ( FAS ) . <p> But often , Pike notes , information systems " are fairly difficult for people to visualize ; ' and therefore are also difficult to cover . Take the " Echelon " system , for example . According to the FAS , Echelon " consists of a global network of computers that automatically search through millions of intercepted messages for preprogrammed keywords or fax , telex , and e-mail addresses . Every word of every message in the frequencies and channels selected at a station is automatically searched : ' Sound like something you should have heard of ? If you live in the United States , you probably have n't . In Europe , however , Echelon-supposedly driven by ' the supersecretive National Security Agency but involving the governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of coverage . In January , a report by an analyst with the Omega Foundation , a British human rights organization , written at the behest of a European Parliament research unit , kicked off a substantial public policy debate about the right of governments to intrude on citizens ' privacy . If you believe even half of the story , there 's a lot to debate . <p> Of course , there 's no way to prove yet if Echelon exists . There 's no doubt , however , that it has gone almost entirely unexamined here . " It just has n't got any traction in the U.S. , " says Steven Aftergood , who runs the FAS 's Secrecy and Government Project . " But various government bodies in Europe are wondering what 's going on : ' <p> Another surveillance system is also getting its share of attention in Europe : Have Stare , a recently declassified Air Force radar that tracks all manner of space objects , is due to be set up in Norway by 2000 . Norway 's initial announcement of the deployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little coverage that the event received in the U.S. repeated this line . <p> The Have Stare radar in Norway <p> But among the many stated- roles for Have Stare is as a possible early-warning sensor for a U.S. national missile defense system-essentially a trip wire for missiles headed our way . Have Stare could also be a nifty intelligence-gathering tool , given its position along the Russian border , from which it could observe missile tests within that country . And , Pike suggests , Norway would be a good spot to observe long-range missiles flying from the Middle East toward the United States . Coverage of Have Stare by the Norwegian newspaper Bergens Tidende sparked a local debate over the radar 's possible role in a U.S. defense system . In the U.S. , though , where " Star Wars " is a mainstay of national security reporting , the press has barely touched on Have Stare and the larger issue of U.S. intelligence gathering abroad . <p> Information on Echelon , Have Stare , and other programs is readily Abundant-ironically , the same rapid advances in information technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier than ever to find out about and report on military and intelligence issues . Pike , in fact , has compiled on the FAS Web site ( www.fas.org ) the most comprehensive database available on the intelligence community , including how much is spent , what 's being purchased , and where various agencies ' classified facilities are located . And Aftergood has been instrumental in driving the government toward classifying fewer documents and declassifying more of its older records . The result has been an unprecedented avalanche of disclosure-more than 400 million pages m the last two years . <p> Of course , for all this new information to make a difference , somebody has to be paying attention . The bad news , Pike and Aftergood believe , is that few are . When the government began to declassify Cold War satellite imagery a few years ago , Pike says he assumed " anybody who had ever written anything about Soviet strategic programs during the Cold War would run right out " and demand to see it . " Which is certainly what we did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else has done that . " <p> " This is a tremendous reversal , " Aftergood says . " Where there was this army of researchers fighting over scraps , now there 's a vast inventory of information resources that are being largely ignored . " <p> by Daniel G.
