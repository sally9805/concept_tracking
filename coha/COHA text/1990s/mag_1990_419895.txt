Section : ENTREPRENEURSHIP <p> Even in a bull market for African-American art , black dealers and gallery owners are finding the business of art tougher than ever . <p> When Byron Atkinson went to a group show at the June Kelly Gallery in New York 's trendy SoHo art district last May , he did n't find the art he wanted hanging on the walls . <p> " I looked at the show , " says Atkinson , " and I said to June , ' What else do you have that 's new and different ? ' She pulled out a canvas from the back and I knew I had to have the painting . " <p> Atkinson paid more than $5,000 for Pumpkin Girls by artist Philemona Williamson . It was just one of the paintings that owner June Kelly often stores in her back room for special clients whose tastes she has come to know . <p> But before Atkinson could take possession , Kelly told him that the painting was committed to a two-month gallery exhibition in California . Atkinson , who was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey during that time , said that he wanted the painting delivered after the exhibition . Not only did Kelly deliver the painting the day Atkinson moved into his new home , but she also delivered two other pieces she had been storing for him  --  one by artist Bob Freeman and the other by artist Michael Kelly Williams . <p> Such conveniences are but a few of the personalized services an art dealer provides for a collector . And June Kelly 's three-year-old gallery is just one in a growing cadre of African-American art dealers and gallery owners emerging as an important force in a revitalized market for black art . <p> At first glance , these dealers may seem like a long overdue response to the mainstream art world , which continues to shut out the work of most black artists . ( According to a 1987 study by artist Howardena Pindell , from 1980 to 1987 more than 90% of the exhibits at New York 's Museum of Modern Art , the Whitney Museum of American Art , the Guggenheim Museum and many major New York galleries were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , on second look , this tenacious band of entrepreneurs is simply taking advantage of a demographic reality : Just as well-educated white consumers have acquired a taste for fine art and the money to invest in it , so too have a small , but ardent number of young , black middle-class art lovers . " The market is there , " says Kelly of the increasing number of black dealers and gallery owners . " We have to cultivate it ourselves . There has been an awareness among blacks that they should support black artists . There 's a commitment to buy their work and preserve it as a historical identity for black people . " A Tripling Of Black Collectors <p> Although black people have always been art collectors , years ago there were too few to support a large number of art galleries or dealers , During the past five years , however , there has been a noticeable increase . In a national survey last year , Art Business News , a trade magazine , revealed a healthy market for black art . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by black artists may range from $500,000 to $1 million , and sales of prints and posters may range up to $6 million . <p> This is a significant change from a decade ago , says Ernestine Brown , co-owner of Malcolm Brown Gallery , named for her husband , a water color artist . " When we first started , our clientele were almost exclusively white , " she says of collectors who first sought out her Shaker Heights , Ohio , gallery . " Malcolm Brown was the first gallery in Ohio to show the works of black artists in any substantial way , " she says . <p> In 1980 the Browns took out a $30,000 loan from the Small Business Administration to open their 1,400-square-foot gallery in the upper-middle class Cleveland suburb . " I see more black people able to pay $1,000 to $3,500 much more easily than when we first started , " Brown notes . " The number of black collectors has tripled over the past 10 years . Many of them realize that having work by a black artist hanging on their wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Amid this new demand for black art , prices have escalated accordingly . " A decade ago , it was unheard of that works by blacks or African-Americans would sell for $100,000 , " says noted black art historian and consultant David Driskell , professor of art at the University of Maryland in College Park . " That record was shattered in 1981 , when the Thankful Poor , an oil by Henry Ossawa Tanner , auctioned for more than $280,000 . " The painting was bought by Bill Cosby . <p> Today , works by the popular artist Romare Bearden , who died in 1987 , sell for more than $60,000 . Jacob Lawrence can command up to $75,000 or more for his work , and in 1989 , the Barnett-Aden Collection , a group of 142 works by 60 of the world 's best-known 19th and 20th-century black artists , was sold for a phenomenal $6 million to the Florida Endowment Fund for Higher Education , an agency that provides money for college scholarships to minority students . <p> Though prices for African-American art have escalated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astronomical prices being paid for work by white artists , living and dead : Jasper John 's paintings are sold for $17 million , and this year Van Gogh 's Portrait of Dr. Gachet sold for a record $82.5 million . <p> Black dealers are positioning themselves to capitalize on the demand for black art because sentiment is growing that black art stands to be the best art value for the money in the 1990s . But a strong , vibrant market is still five to 10 years off , most dealers say . The reality is that despite the increased interest in art , most black collectors are beginners in their early 30s , who generally spend between $1,500 and $3,000 . Most spend much less , opting for less expensive posters or limited edition prints . Labor Of Love , Not Profits <p> So , for most dealers , selling art is , at best , a labor of love rather than a bottom-line endeavor . Few can make a living selling only the art hanging on the walls , so they frequently run compatible businesses such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expensive venture . " In the commercial world , the ability to run a gallery has to do with your ability to assemble the venture capital up front , " says Mary Schmidt Campbell , New York City 's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs . " Galleries are in high rent districts . You must maintain the work , mount the exhibits , mail invitations , print catalogs . It 's expensive . " <p> Opening an art gallery is itself a costly endeavor . Because the art industry as a whole is a business still in its infant stage , hard costs are difficult to come by . In general , a gallery owner does not have to invest huge sums of money to purchase art . He or she can take pieces on consignment . Some of the less obvious costs involve installing the proper lighting to show an exhibit , travel expenses to view the work of artists and renovation costs involved in transforming a space into a gallery . And as with many businesses , one of the escalating costs in the art gallery business is liability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most important considerations in determining how successful a gallery will be . While free-standing shopping centers in business districts are generally an ideal location because of the parking facilities and pedestrian traffic , shopping malls are generally too expensive . <p> The Ann Taylor Gallery , at the Cliff Mall in Dallas , may be an exception to this rule . In business for three years after leaving the U.S. Postal Service , owner Ann Taylor spent $2,500 to open her 1,200-square-foot gallery . Because Dallas is in the midst of a real estate slump , she was able to convince mall owners to remodel her space to accommodate her gallery and to give her six months rent free . She spent $5,000 to advertise and did $100,000 in her first year of business in 1987 . She spent another $2,500 on posters and art materials and obtained original works on consignment . <p> Taylor 's business includes selling prints , posters , custom framing and publishing art work . Her prints sell from $15 to $100 , and originals sell from $100 to $12,000 , Thirty percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original art sales and 50% of her business is framing . " Framing is a large chunk of my business , " she admits . " I do n't like it that way . " <p> Soon after opening , Taylor realized she needed a larger space . She has since moved into a 3,000-square-foot space and the mall gave her an additional 1,200-square-feet , which she leases to community groups . Her monthly overhead is about $10,000 and her insurance premium is about $1,200 a year for $1 million worth of coverage . <p> Taylor says her efforts are paying off . She made a profit on gross sales of $300,000 in 1989 . Her monthly overhead is $10,000 and she pays herself an annual salary of $50,000 . " By paying yourself a handsome salary , " Taylor , who recently acquired a second gallery in Austin , Texas , reasons " you are going to work harder . " <p> However , hard work wo n't bring instant success . In 1986 , Isobel Neal spent $10,000 to open her namesake gallery in the River North section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the first black member of the Chicago Gallery Association , Neal pays annual membership dues of $500 . Her monthly overhead is about $5,000 , much of which includes traveling to visit artists and clients . She has yet to turn a profit . <p> One of Neal 's largest sales in 1989 was a sculpture by Herbert House , which sold for $15,000 . She is negotiating for more sales of House 's works to the Harris Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago , and she may also be selling some of sculptor Elizabeth Catlett 's work to two other institutions . Galleries And Dealers <p> Although there are many galleries , dealers make a distinction between being a gallery owner and an art dealer . As the middleman between the artist and the public , the dealer 's job is two-fold : to nurture the growing pool of black art enthusiasts and to manage the careers of artists who are denied access to mainstream galleries and museums . While a gallery owner may sell an artist 's work on consignment , he or she may not necessarily work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive a 35% to 50% commission for selling an artist 's work . But often dealers get less . For example , to locate a piece of art for a collector , a dealer may get a 10% commission , called a finder 's fee . And when a dealer negotiates with another dealer on behalf of a collector , they may split the commission . <p> The services of a good dealer can make an artist 's career and enhance a collection . A dealer woos clients on behalf of their artists , ensures that they are represented in prestigious collections , gets them included in important books , bills clients for art purchases and provides emotional support . <p> Strong sales still means educating people about art , says George N'Namdi , owner of the nine-year-old G.R. N'Namdi Gallery in Birmingham , Mich. , a Detroit suburb . " I spend a lot of time talking to people , " he says . Years ago , one of his clients started a collection with a piece that cost $400 . Today , that collector regularly purchases work for $6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asserts . " Let them know they have something else to reach for . " <p> N'Namdi spent $40,000 in savings to open his first gallery , which was a huge 5,000-square-feet . Today , his smaller , but sizable 2,000-square-foot gallery is in one of Michigan 's expensive suburbs . His monthly overhead is about $20,000 . <p> Art galleries are also opening in the less expensive range . Selling reproductions is the bread and butter of Savacou Gallery in New York 's East Village . " We sell original works and reproductions , " says Byrma Braham , co-owner with Loris Crawford . " But reproduction work is much more viable . " <p> In business since 1985 , the two women advertise in the black press and sell mostly limited edition prints and posters through catalogs nationally and internationally . They offer art seminars and framing services . They started their business with $20,000 and annual sales in 1989 were $200,000 . Their monthly overhead is about $8,000 . <p> Last November , Savacou joined with five other New York-based galleries to form the American Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crawford says the group plans to help gallery owners and dealers become strong enough to compete with larger and more financially established white-owned galleries . The group plans seminars on management techniques , marketing , packaging artists and launching advertising campaigns . <p> But just as black collectors and gallery owners have begun to realize that black art is the best value in an over-inflated art market , Crawford says , so have many whiteowned galleries and poster shops . With the increasing popularity of black art , black-owned galleries are getting more competition from large posters houses and art publishing companies that buy reproductions of black art . Even retail chains such as McCrory and JC Penney have stocked up on black art reproductions . " The mainstream is trying to capitalize on it , " says Crawford . " They 're trying to undercut our prices . If you 're not careful , everybody will jump in and grab what they want and leave . " <p> African-American gallery owners remain adamant that black galleries must remain the vessel of black culture . " It 's important for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's also important to be presented your culture by your own . " <p> By INGRID STURGIS <p>
