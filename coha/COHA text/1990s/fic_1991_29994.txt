1 Mary Minor Haristeen , Harry to her friends , trotted along the railroad track . Following at her heels were Mrs. Murphy , her wise and willful tiger cat , and Tee Tucker , her Welsh corgi . Had you asked the cat and the dog they would have told you that Harry belonged to them , not vice versa , but there was no doubt that Harry belonged to the little town of Crozet , Virginia . At thirty-three she was the youngest postmistress Crozet had ever had , but then no one else really wanted the job . Crozet nestles in the haunches of the Blue Ridge Mountains . The town proper consists of Railroad Avenue , which parallels the Chesapeake &; Ohio Railroad track , and a street intersecting it called the Whitehall Road . Ten miles to the east reposes the rich and powerful small city of Charlottesville , which , like a golden fungus , is spreading east , west , north , and south . Harry liked Charlottesville just fine . It was the developers she did n't much like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crozet and its three thousand inhabitants as a dinky little whistle stop on the route west and ignore it . A gray clapboard building with white trim , next to the rail depot , housed the post office . Next to that was a tiny grocery store and a butcher shop run by " Market " Shiflett . Everyone appreciated this convenience because you could pick up your milk , mail , and gossip in one central location . Harry unlocked the door and stepped inside just as the huge railroad clock chimed seven beats for 7:00 a.m . Mrs. Murphy scooted under her feet and Tucker entered at a more leisurely pace . An empty mail bin invited Mrs. Murphy . She hopped in . Tucker complained that she could n't jumpin . " Tucker , hush . Mrs. Murphy will be out in a minute -- wo n't you ? " Harry leaned over the bin . Mrs. Murphy stared right back up at her and said , " Fat chance . Let Tucker bitch . She stole my catnip sockie this morning . " All Harry heard was a meow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real shit , Mrs. Murphy . You 've got a million of those socks . " Mrs. Murphy put her paws on the edge of the bin and peeped over . " So what . I did n't say you could play with any of them . " " Stop that , Tucker . " Harry thought the dog was growling for no reason at all . A horn beeped outside . Rob Collier , driving the huge mail truck , was delivering the morning mail . He 'd return at four that afternoon for pickup . " You 're early , " Harry called to him . " Figured I 'd cut you a break . " Rob smiled . " Because in exactly one hour Mrs. Hogendobber will be standing outside this door huffing and puffing for her mail . " He dumped two big duffel bags on the front step and went back to the truck . Harry carried them inside . " Hey , I 'd have done that for you . " " I know , " Harry said . " I need the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tucker , " Rob greeted the dog . Tucker wagged her tail . " Well , neither rain nor sleet nor snow , et cetera . " Rob slid behind the wheel . " It 's seventy-nine degrees at seven , Rob . I would n't worry about the sleet if I were you . " He smiled and drove off . Harry opened the first bag . Mrs. Hogendobber 's mail was on the top , neatly bound with a thick rubber band . Rob , if he had the time , put Mrs. Hogendobber 's mail in a pile down at the main post office in Charlottesville . Harry slipped the handful of mail into the mail slot . She then began sorting through the rest of the stuff : bills , enough mail-order catalogues to provide clothing for every man , woman , and child in the United States , and of course personal letters and postcards . Courtney Shiflett , Market 's fourteen-year-old daughter , received a postcard from Sally McIntire , away at camp . Kelly Craycroft , the handsome , rich paving contractor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a photo of a beautiful angel with wings . Harry flipped it over . It was Oscar Wilde 's tombstone in the Piere Lachaise cemetery . On the back was the message " Wish you were here . " No signature . The handwriting was computer script , like signatures on letters from your congressperson . Harry sighed and slipped it into Kelly 's box . It must be heaven to be in Paris . Snowcapped Alps majestically covered a postcard addressed to Harry from her lifelong friend Lindsay Astrove . Dear Harry -- Arrived in Zurich . No gnomes in sight . Good flight . Very tired . Will write some more later . Best , lindsay It must be heaven to be in Zurich . Bob Berryman , the largest stock trailer dealer in the South , got a registered letter from the IRS . Harry gingerly put it in his box . Harry 's best friend , Susan Tucker , received a large package from James River Traders , probably those discounted cotton sweaters she 'd ordered . Susan , prudent , waited for the sales . Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tee because Susan gave her to Harry on the seventh tee at the Farmington Country Club . Mrs. Murphy , two years the dog 's senior , was not amused , but she came to accept it . A Gary Larsen postcard attracted Harry 's attention . Harry turned it over . It was addressed to Fair Haristeen , her soon-to-be-ex-husband , but not soon enough . " Hang in there , buddy " was the message from Stafford Sanburne . Harry jammed the postcard in Fair 's box . Crozet was still small enough that people felt compelled to take sides during a divorce . Perhaps even New York City was that small . At any rate , Harry reeled from fury to sorrow on a daily basis as she watched former friends choose sides , and most were choosing Fair . After all , she had left him , thereby outraging other women in Albemarle County stuck in a miserable marriage but lacking the guts to go . That was a lot of women . " Thank God they did n't have children , " clucked many tongues behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . With children the goddamned divorce would take a year . Without , the limbo lasted only six months and she was two down . By the time the clock struck eight the two duffel bags were folded over , the boxes filled , the old pine plank floor swept clean . Mrs. George Hogendobber , an evangelical Protestant , picked up her mail punctually at 8:00 a.m. each morning except Sunday , when she was evangeling and the post office was closed . She fretted a great deal over evolution . She was determined to prove that humans were not descended from apes but , rather , created in God 's own image . Mrs. Murphy fervently hoped that Mrs. Hogendobber would prove her case , because linking man and ape was an insult to the ape . Of course , the good woman would die of shock to discover that God was a cat and therefore humans were off the board entirely . That large Christian frame was lurching itself up the stairs . She pushed open the door with her characteristic vigor . " Morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a good weekend ? " " Apart from a splendid service at the Holy Light Church , no . " She yanked out her mail . " Josiah DeWitt stopped by as I came home and gave me his sales pitch to part with Mother 's Louis XVI bed , canopies and all . And on the Sabbath . The man is a servant of Mammon . " " Yes -- but he knows good stuff when he sees it . " Harry flattered her . " H-m-m , Louis this and Louis that . Too many Louis 's over there in France . Came to a bad end , too , every one of them . I do n't think the French have produced anyone of note since Napoleon . " " What about Claudius Crozet ? " This stopped Mrs. Hogendobber for a moment . " Believe you 're right . Created one of the engineering wonders of the nineteenth century . I stand corrected . But that 's the only one since Napoleon . " The town of Crozet was named for this same Claudius Crozet , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he fought with the French in Russia and was captured on the hideous retreat from Moscow . So charmed was his Russian captor that he promptly removed Claudius to his huge estate and set him up with books and engineering tools . Claudius performed services for his captor until Frenchmen were allowed to return home . They say the Russian , a prince of the blood , rewarded the young captain with jewels , gold , and silver . Joining Napoleon 's second run at power proved dangerous , and Crozet immigrated to America . If he had a fortune , he carefully concealed it and lived off his salary . His greatest feat was cutting four railroad tunnels through the Blue Ridge Mountains , a task begun in 1850 and completed eight years later . The first tunnel was west of Crozet : the Greenwood tunnel , 536 feet , and sealed after 1944 , when a new tunnel was completed . Over the eastern portal of the Greenwood tunnel , carved in stone , is the legend : c. crozet , chief engineer ; e. t. d. myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1852 . The second tunnel , Brooksville , 864 feet , was also sealed after 1944 . This was a treacherous tunnel because the rock proved soft and unreliable . The third tunnel was the Little Rock , 100 feet long and still in use by the C &; O. The fourth was the Blue Ridge , a long 4,723 feet . Unused tracks ran to the sealed tunnels . They built things to last in the nineteenth century , for none of the rails had ever warped . Crozet was reputed to have hidden his fortune in one of the tunnels . This story was taken seriously enough by the C &; O Railroad that they carefully inspected the discontinued tunnels before sealing them after World War II . No treasure was ever found . Mrs. Hogendobber left immediately after being corrected . She passed Ned Tucker , Susan 's husband , on his way in . They exchanged pleasantries . Tee Tucker , barking merrily , rushed out to greet Ned . Mrs. Murphy climbed out of the mail bin and jumped onto the counter . She liked Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , have you been born again ? " " No , and I was n't born yesterday either . " She laughed . " Mrs. H. was unusually terse this morning . " He grabbed a huge handful of mail , most of it for the law office of Sanburne , Tucker , and Anderson . " Count your blessings , " Harry said . " I do , every day . " Ned smiled . Escaping a tirade of salvation on this hot July morning was just one blessing and Ned was a happy enough man to know there 'd be many more . He stooped to rub Tucker 's ears . " You can rub mine , too , " Mrs. Murphy pleaded . " He likes me better than you . " Tucker relished being the center of attention . " Do n't you love the sounds they make ? " Ned kept scratching . " Sometimes I think they 're almost human . " " Can you believe that ? " Mrs. Murphy licked her front paws . Being human , the very thought ! Humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , she could hear a doodlebug burrow in the sand . Furthermore , she understood everything humans said in their guttural way . They rarely understood her or other animals , much less one another . To get a reaction out of even Harry , who she confessed she did love , she had to resort to extravagant behavior . " Yeah , I do n't know what I 'd do without my kids . Speaking of which , how 're yours ? " Ned 's eyes darted for a moment . " Harry , I 'm beginning to think that sending Brookie to private school was a mistake . She 's twelve going on twenty , and a perfect little snob too . Susan wants her to return to St. Elizabeth 's in the fall but I say we yank her out of there and pack her back to public middle school with her brother . There she has to learn how to get along with all different kinds of people . Her grades fell and that 's when Susan decided she was going to St. Elizabeth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we turned out all right . " " It 's a tough call , Ned . They were n't selling drugs in the bathroom when you were in school . " " They were by the time we got to Crozet High . You had the good sense to ignore it . " " No , I did n't have the money to buy the stuff . Had I been one of those rich little subdivision kids -- like today -- who 's to say ? " Harry shrugged . Ned sighed . " I 'd hate to be a child now . " " Me too . " Bob Berryman interrupted . " Hey ! " Ozzie , his hyper Australian shepherd , tagged at his heels . " Hey , Berryman , " Harry and Ned both called back to him out of politeness . Berryman 's personality hovered on simmer and often flamed up to boil . Mrs. Murphy and Tucker said hello to Ozzie . " Hotter than the hinges of hell . " Berryman sauntered over to his box and withdrew the mail , including the registered letter slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She handed him a leaky ballpoint . He signed the slip and glared at the IRS notice . " The world is going to hell in a handbasket and the goddamned IRS controls the nation ! I 'd kill every one of those sons of bitches given half the chance ! " Ned walked out of the post office waving goodbye . Berryman gulped some air , forced a smile , and calmed himself by petting Mrs. Murphy , who liked him although most humans found him brusque . " Well , I 've got worms to turn and eggs to lay . " He pushed off . Bob 's booted feet clomped on the first step as he closed the front door . As she did n't hear a second footfall , Harry glanced up from her stamp pads . Walking toward Bob was Kelly Craycroft . His chestnut hair , gleaming in the light , looked like burnished bronze . Kelly , an affable man , was n't smiling . Wagging his tail , Ozzie stood next to Bob . Bob still did n't move . Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said something to Bob which Harry could n't hear , and then moved up to the second step , whereupon Bob pushed him down the steps . Furious , his face darkening , Kelly scrambled to his feet . " You asshole ! " Harry heard that loud and clear . Bob , without replying , sauntered down the steps , but Kelly , not a man to be trifled with , grabbed Bob 's shoulder . " You listen to me and you listen good ! " Kelly shouted . Harry wanted to move out from behind the counter . Good manners got the better of her . It would be too obvious . Instead she strained every fiber to hear what was being said . Tucker and Mrs. Murphy , hardly worried about how they 'd look to others , bumped into each other as they ran to the door . This time Bob raised his voice . " Take your hand off my shoulder . " Kelly squeezed harder and Bob balled up his fist , hitting him in the stomach . Kelly doubled over but caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob 's legs and throwing him to the pavement . Ozzie , moving like a streak , sank his teeth into Kelly 's left leg . Kelly hollered and let go of Bob , who jumped up . " No " was all Bob had to say to Ozzie , and the dog immediately obeyed . Kelly stayed on the ground . He pulled up his pants leg . Ozzie 's bite had broken the skin . A trickle of blood ran into his sock .
