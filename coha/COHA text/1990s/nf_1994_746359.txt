Thanks to the early ethnographic work of Margaret Mead and Reo Fortune , the Mountain Arapesh of the East Sepik Province , Papua New Guinea , have become one of the standard exemplars of human culture . They constitute one of 30 New Guinea cases in the Ethnographic Atlas , they have featured in numerous comparative analyses , and , thanks to Mead 's Sex and Temperament ( reprinted numerous times since its appearance in 1935 ) , they are perhaps better known to a western lay audience than almost any other Melanesian people . The impact of this ethnographic record is the more impressive given that Mead and Fortune spent less than eight months of 1931-32 in their fieldbase of Alitoa in the Prince Alexander Mountains . In that short time , however , Mead in particular gathered enough data to fill five volumes and numerous articles , a record that Fox ( 1983:40 ) quite rightly calls one " of the great ethnographic descriptions in the old grand manner . " <p> As impressive as it is , the Mountain Arapesh corpus is not without its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent encyclopedia entry on the Mountain Arapesh ( Roscoe 1991a ) , ethnographic omissions and semantic confusions make it impossible to establish exactly the full nature of Arapesh settlement patterns and social groups . In this article , I describe these problems and report the results of a recent expedition to Mountain Arapesh territory to clarify matters . My purpose is partly ethnographic and partly methodological . By adding details that Mead and Fortune omitted , I seek to deepen our knowledge of Arapesh life and shed light on a problem in the description of Melanesian settlement and sociality . THE MOUNTAIN ARAPESH <p> The problems in comprehending Mountain Arapesh settlement and sociality begin with the difficulty of establishing population density due to a lack of accurate maps of Arapesh settlements . Mead 's second volume included a chart of the " Mountain Villages , " apparently drawn from a government map of the Sepik District ( Mead 1938:156,346 ; 1947:181fn ) , but it is too small and inaccurate to be of any real use . Subsequent maps produced by colonial and postcolonial authorities have their own problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravages that World War II had wrought on their mountain settlements , the Mountain Arapesh abandoned the peaklands . Those in the south migrated into the high southern foothills above Yangoru and Maprik Government Stations ( Roscoe 1983:138-40 ; Scaglion , pers.comm. ) , while the central and northern villagers moved to coastal settlements around Dagua to participate in the development movement sponsored by Pita Simogun , a native police officer ( WPR 3-47/48:3-4 , 1-49/50:1 , 1-53/54:n.p. , 553/54:1 ) . By the early 1960s , only two old men were still living in Alitoa , looking after a few pigs ( Mead 1971:vii ) . In 1991 , the people of Alitoa began to return to their mountain locality to escape impending logging activity along the coast , but the peaklands remained largely deserted . As a result , published topographic maps of the region ( e.g. , TPNG 1971 ) have been unable to locate more than four of the nineteen " Mountain Villages " that Mead marked on her published sketch map or mentioned in her accounts. 2 <p> The absence of accurate settlement maps poses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine the degree to which Mountain Arapesh settlements were nucleated , a particular problem given Mead 's conflicting representations on the subject . Supposedly , people lived " a scattered , seminomadic life " ( Mead 1937:20 , see also 1933:38 , 1947:268 ) ; yet , they also lived in " villages , " a term that conjures images of large , nucleated settlements . This impression is underscored by the dots marking " Mountain Villages " on her sketch map ( Mead 1938:156 ) . Second , without reliable maps , it is impossible to clarify the confusion surrounding Mead and Fortune 's terminology for settlements and residential groups . The entity known as " Alipinagle " illustrates the problem . In Mead 's ( 1938:347 ) Gazetteer of the Sepik District , Alipinagle is described as " a hamlet of the Mountain Arapesh , Alitoa village " ; yet , it fails to appear on her " Hamlet Check List " for Alitoa ( Mead 1947:396 ) . Elsewhere , it is a " hill-top . . . village " ( Mead 19631935:17 , see also 1947:265 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Mountain Villages " ( Mead 1938:156 ) . Elsewhere again , it is one of several " villages or , more properly speaking perhaps , hamlet centers that . . . functioned in Alitoa " ( Mead 1947:275 ) ; yet , there is no explanation of whether a " hamlet center " means an area boasting several hamlets , a central area used by several hamlets , or some other residential arrangement . <p> Similar inconsistencies surround the names " Manuniki , " " Yapiaun , " and " Malis " : on some occasions these are " hamlets " ; on others , " villages " ( e.g. , Mead 1947:243,249,274,275,396 ) . Alitoa , Mead and Fortune 's fieldsite , is variously called a hamlet , a hamlet center , a village , and a locality ( e.g. , Mead 1938:202,347 ; 1947:275,389 ) . Adding to the confusion , Fortune refers to Arapesh " hamlets " in his ethnographic work ( e.g. , Fortune 1939:25 ) , but , in his translations of indigenous texts , refers to " villages " ( Fortune 1942:14,87-207 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters with the comment that : <p> The small gens hamlet . . . is identical in form with the larger village . In the largest hamlet in a locality , however , two or more gentes may be represented with as many small plazas , but in the small hamlet there is traditionally only one plaza . If space permits , there is always the possibility of adding the members of other gentes permanently and thus changing a small hamlet to a large one . <p> Yet , by seeming to equate small hamlets , large hamlets , and villages in the very attempt to differentiate them , this enigmatic paragraph only raises further questions . At a yet higher sociological level , we learn that " clusters of villages are grouped into localities " ( Mead 1963 1935 : 15-16 ) ; yet , " the locality is really an enlargement of the ideal village " ( Mead 1947:179 ) . <p> Mead 's fieldnotes , and those of Fortune 's to which I have had access , 3 provide little in the way of further clarification . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usages , and though Mead 's ( 1932a ) notes contain a scratch map of Alitoa , it marks only eleven of the 23 settlements she mentions in her work and offers neither a scale nor any orienting feature beyond the cardinal points , which appear to be misplaced. 4 MOUNTAIN ARAPESH SETTLEMENT AND SOCIALITY <p> In August 1991 , in an attempt to clarify these ethnographic omissions and semantic confusions , I undertook a five-day trip to Mountain Arapesh territory to gather data on the locations of Mead 's Mountain Villages , on the distribution of settlements in her fieldsite of Alitoa , and on the social relationships that existed among these settlements in 1931-32 . Figure 1 ( cf. Table 1 ) , compiled from Mead 's own data , the memories of several elderly Alitoa men and women who were alive in her day , and a tour of Alitoa itself in the company of four adult Alitoan males , represents a best attempt to locate Alitoa 's occupied settlements at the time of Mead and Fortune 's stay . Cartography was aided by enlarged sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a compass , two-way travel times , and ( in subsequent analysis ) aerial photos . Few of the settlements marked are likely to be more than 200 meters off their true position . <p> A close reading of Mead and Fortune 's writings , coupled with information collected from the people of Alitoa , make it clear that most of the settlements on Figure 1 were " little places " ( sho'ubeli wabul ) , ranging in size from gardening , hunting , and pig-herding camps of one or two houses to hamlets of perhaps half a dozen buildings ( Mead 1938:202,207 ) . Reflecting the mobility of mountain life , few of these settlements were permanent : " the sites for the small hamlets tend to shift from generation to generation ; the residences in gardens and sago patches are even more casual and mobile " ( Mead 1938:208 ) . <p> A sho'ubeli wabul was the principal home of a family or lineage that interacted and conceived of itself as a social unit ( Mead 1938:207 , 19631935:16 ) . In the normal course of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hamlets were affiliated by circumstances of geography , history , and kinship into what I call a ceremonial community . This community took its name from a central , usually somewhat larger settlement that I call a ceremonial center , which served as the locus of members ' social and ceremonial life while providing a handful with primary homes and several others with second homes ( Mead 1938:207 , 1947:179 , 19631935:5 ) . 5 <p> Beyond the ceremonial community was a social order that both Mead and Fortune called the " locality . " According to Fortune ( 1939:23 ) , this was " the sovereign group , " but Mead ( 1963 1935:16 ) characterized it as having " no political organization . " " Locality is really a misleading term here . The organization is one of a series of overlapping circles " ( Mead 1932b ) . My investigations indicate the locality was simply a ceremonial community writ large . Just as the families and lineages of several camps and hamlets were aggregated into a ceremonial community , so several ceremonial communities formed a locality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as its ceremonial center , so one among the locality 's several ceremonial centers served as what I shall call its principal ceremonial center . It was from this center that the locality as a whole derived its name ( Mead 1947:179,181 ) . Here , its members gathered to hold feasts for other localities and discuss issues such as intefiocality war and peace , the purchase of new ceremonial complexes from other localities , and so on . <p> Alitoa locality contained four ceremonial communities ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) . The 125 members of Alitoa community lived in Alitoa ceremonial center ( settlement 4 ) and 21 associated camps and hamlets . The twenty members of Alipinagle community resided in Alipinagle ceremonial center ( settlement 21 ) and two associated camps and hamlets . The 47 members of Ahalesimihi community lived in Ahalesimihi ceremonial center ( settlement 23 ) and perhaps three associated camps and hamlets . Finally , the ten members of Yapiaun community resided in Yapiaun ceremonial center ( settlement 30 ) and perhaps five associated camps and hamlets ( Mead 1947:275,389-95 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial center ( settlement 4 , Figure 1 ) . Figure 2 , compiled from information gathered in the peaklands and from unpublished maps of the region ( Namuesh 1990 ; WPR 3-47/48 , 1-49/50 ) , marks the position of this and eighteen other principal ceremonial centers. 7 By no means do these exhaust the list of Mountain Arapesh localities in 1932 ; moreover , the position of Albast could be in error by several kilometers , though the rest probably err by no more than a kilometer . <p> This picture of Mountain Arapesh settlement and sociality fits strikingly well with a regional pattern reported among the foothill peoples to the immediate south . Among the Yangoru Boiken , who appear to have close prehistoric links to the Mountain Arapesh ( Roscoe 1989 ) , each " village " has several mandawia ( big places ) among its 15-35 " hamlets . " Each mandawia is claimed by one ( and sometimes more than one ) clanlike congery of lineages as the home of its apical ancestor , and here lineage members ( a few of whom live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) build their spirit houses , conduct their exchange ceremonies , and hold their major moots ( Roscoe 1991 b : 388 ) . In the Western Abelam " village " of Neligum ( Scaglion 1976:67-75 ) , the residents of 58 " hamlets " are affiliated with one or another of five " ceremonial groups , " each of which is centered on from one to three ame ( hamlets having ceremonial grounds ) ( see also Forge 1972:372-73 on the Eastern Abelam ; Kaberry 1973:45-47 and Lea 1964:46 on the Central Abelam ) . In the enormous Southern Arapesh " village " of Ilahita , the residents of 89 " hamlets " are divided into six " wards , " each of which has " a fair amount of autonomy " over its " internal political and ritual affairs " ( Tuzin 1976:56 ) and apparently takes the name of a " ceremonial hamlet " with which it is associated ( Tuzin 1976:88 ) . In each of these cases , in sum , we find apparent equivalents to the Mountain Arapesh sho'ubeli wabul ( hamlet ) , ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial group ( clanlike congery , ceremonial group , ward ) , and locality ( village ) . SETTLEMENT , SOCIALITY , AND SEMANTICS <p> With Mountain Arapesh settlement and sociality now clarified , it is possible to address the terminological confusions in Mead and Fortune 's ethnographic record , particularly in their use of the terms , hamlet and village . In the edition of Notes and Queries ( Anon. 1929 ) current during their fieldwork and subsequent writing , these terms were discussed under the heading of " the local group . " A " hamlet " constituted houses " grouped together " ; the main reference to " villages " was that they " may be stockaded . or be large settlements stretching out the length of the cultivation " ( Anon. 1929:59 ) . 8 These comments fail to specify how a hamlet differs from a village , but dictionaries of the time ( e.g. , OED 1933 ; Webster 1937 ) defined both as a collection , group , or assemblage of houses and other buildings in the country , a hamlet differing from a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also reveal that then , as now , the two terms had an additional , human dimension , metonymically referring to the people who live in the material manifestations of a hamlet or village . This human dimension , in its turn , carried a social dimension , referring to the collective behavior of hamlet or village residents . Thus , it could be said , " The hamlet/village banned fireworks from the Fourth of July celebration , " as though the residents as a whole constituted a single living entity . <p> In the Western world , patterns of settlement and sociality are such that the material , human , and social dimensions of villages and hamlets are , so to speak , coterminous : the humans inhabiting the material structures of these settlements commonly behave as a social entity , distinct from other such entities . Consequently , statements such as , " The village is scheduled for a new bypass , " prove quite unproblematic , even though the reference could be to a village materially , humanly , and/or socially defined . Problems emerge , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which these different dimensions of settlement and sociality are separated from one another . <p> In the Arapesh case , the sho'ubeli wabul ( the basic settlements and residential groups of mountain life ) posed no particular terminological problem . As geographically distinct , family- or lineage-based entities , their material , human , and social dimensions were largely coterminous . Consequently , Mead and Fortune could call them hamlets and slide quite unproblematically among this term 's different semantic levels . Without generating any particular confusion , for example , Mead could discuss the " hamlet " of Yapiaun in its material dimension , " perched on the top of a hill with hardly room for a few small houses " ( Mead 1947:266 ) ; its human dimension , " a three-man hamlet " ( Mead 1947:275 ) ; and its social dimension , " a family hamlet , " " Yapiaun seems . . . to have been on good terms with Alitoa " ( Mead 1947:266,275 ) . <p> The problems arose at the transhamlet level , where the semantic meshes of Western settlement terms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and localities . On the one hand , neither entity was located in a single material settlement ; on the other , some of their members had residences in two or even more settlements ( viz. , a ceremonial center , a hamlet , and sometimes also a camp ) . If we were to judge from their warning that fieldworkers should discover " how far , if at all , the village forms a self-conscious local group , " the authors of Notes and Queries ( Anon. 1929:59 ) recognized the dangers of applying the term village to such a situation . Mead and Fortune , it seems , did not , and they ended up deploying the term in three very different senses . <p> To begin with , Mead used " village , " " feasting village , " " ceremonial village , " and " hamlet center " ( e.g. , Mead 1947:252,263,275 ) , to distinguish the ceremonial center from its affiliated " hamlets . " In so doing , she apparently had two differentiating criteria in mind . On the one hand , the ceremonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gens hamlet . . . is identical in form with the larger village " ( Mead 1938:207 ) . On the other , it was a locus of social and ceremonial activity : the ceremonial center is a " village , around which cluster a number of small hamlets , with all ceremonial life centered in the village " ( Mead 1947:179 , see also 1947:252 ) . 9 <p> If these were the criteria for her use of village and hamlet , Mead was inconsistent in applying them . Most notably , she frequently referred to Alitoa locality 's four ceremonial centers ( Alitoa , Ahalesimihi , Alipinagle , and Yapiaun ) as hamlets even though their ceremonial status should have made them villages ( e.g. , Mead 1938:346,347 ; 1947:257,266,275,390-96 ) . When she referred to Alitoa ceremonial center as both a village and a large hamlet in the same paragraph ( Mead 1938:202 ) , she apparently forgot that , in her terms , its ceremonial status made it a village . In the case of Yapiaun , her tendency to call this a hamlet , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its size , which was apparently no bigger than a sho'ubeli wabul or hamlet ( Mead 1947:275 ) . In other instances , she may have been lulled into error by a ceremonial center 's status as the principal home for a few members of its associated community . Alitoa ceremonial center , for example , was actually divided into two such residential hamlets , called ( confusingly ) Alitoa and Walinuba , with two families treating the former and one the latter as their main residence ( Mead 1947:243,244,389-95 ) . 10 From the perspective of these individuals , the ceremonial center constituted what a sho'ubeli wabul ( hamlet ) was to everyone else and , since Mead 's principal home was in Alitoa ceremonial center , she may occasionally have adopted a similar train of thought herself . <p> However that may be , Mead 's tendency to forget the ritual status of a ceremonial center and call it a hamlet instead of a village explains why , despite her references to Alipinagle , Yapiaun , and Ahalesimihi as hamlets ( Mead 1938:346-47 ; 1947:257,266,275,390-95 ) , they fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead 1947:396 ) . Though she fails to specify the fact , the checklist refers to the camps and hamlets associated with Alitoa ceremonial center ( i.e. , village ) , not Alitoa locality . Consequently , since Alipinagle , Yapiaun , and Ahalesimihi were actually ceremonial centers in their own right , not hamlets affiliated to Alitoa ceremonial center , they were properly excluded from the list . <p> A similar lapse would explain how , in her most substantive description of Mountain Arapesh settlements ( Mead 1938:202 ) , she could conflate or switch back and forth between village and hamlet to the utter confusion of the reader : <p> The Mountain Arapesh live in a precipitous , infertile country where it is exceedingly difficult to find any level spaces on which to build a hamlet i.e. , village or hamlet or plant a garden . The whole arrangement of their villages i.e. , villages and hamlets , and the terminology they use , implies a village i.e. , village or hamlet located on the very slightly leveled summit of a razor-backed ridge . . . . The assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is located on the top of a hill , so that its central place is surrounded by houses which back up on steep slopes on every side . Alitoa was the largest hamlet i.e. , village or hamlet which we saw in the mountains Most hamlets i.e. , villages or hamlets were much smaller . . . . <p> A large hamlet i.e. , village like Alitoa will contain more than one agehu central plaza . . . . On the agehu itself , a small unwalled house is occasionally built . . . . Here the men of the hamlet i.e. , village or hamlet sit in the evenings and chat with visitors . The village plan has no fixed place for a tamberan spirit house. 11 <p> The same lapse would explain how , in attempting to clarify her use of terms ( quoted above ) , she could end up seeming to equate village , large hamlet , and small hamlet ( Mead 1938 : 207 ) . It explains how she could equate " main village " and " chief hamlet " in describing how the Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead 1947:179 cf. 181 ) . Finally , a similar lapse on Fortune 's part would explain how he could translate wabul/wabur/wabor ( place ) , as both hamlet and village . <p> The second sense in which Mead used the term village was to refer not to the ceremonial center but to the ceremonial community associated with it . Thus , concerning a sorcery dispute within Alitoa ceremonial community : " The feeling of the village was divided " ( Mead 1963 1935:117 ) . On the subject of cultural importation : " Each village , or cluster of small villages , organizes through a long preliminary period to collect the necessary pigs , tobacco , feathers , and shell rings . . . with which to purchase one of these dances . . . . " ( Mead 196311935:9 , see also 1938:208 ; 1947:179,182-83,275 ; 196311935:17 ) . In deploying this second sense of village , apparently , she was metonymically extending the term 's material dimension ( a ceremonial center ) to cover its human and social dimensions ( a ceremonial community ) . 12 The metonymy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western circumstance of co-residence in a single settlement ( the members of a ceremonial community were not , in fact , co-resident ) , but on the unfamiliar circumstance of the co-ordinate social and ceremonial activity that defined the ceremonial center . <p> Mead 's use of village to mean a ceremonial community accounts for her statement that " clusters of villages are grouped into localities " ( Mead 19631935:15-16 ) . Village here meaning ceremonial community , she was referring to the constitution of a locality from several ceremonial communities ( see above ) . But why , then , did she refer to Alipinagle and Ahalesimihi as hamlets of " the Mountain Arapesh village of Alitoa " ( Mead 1938:346,347 ) ? Given that Alipinagle and Ahalesimihi were actually villages in the strict sense of her terms ( i.e. , ceremonial centers or communities ) , how could they also be part of Alitoa village , which was also a ceremonial center and community ? The answer is that Mead deployed village in yet a third sense , to mean locality . This usage was starkly illustrated in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality is mentioned all of these persons are members of the locality of Alitoa " ( Mead 19631935:111fn ) . Apparently , it also was her meaning in comments such as , " the Mountain village . . . is almost entirely dependent upon its own efforts for the purchase of each new dance " ( Mead 1938:335 , see also 1938:326-47 passim , 1947:249 ) . <p> This third use of village explains why Malis is called both a village and a locality ( Mead 1947:272 , cf. 274 ) , and why a gabunyan exchange is referred to , on the one hand , as occurring " between two localities " ( Mead 1947:226 , 1949:304fn ) and , on the other , as an " inter-village exchange " ( Mead 1947:419 , 1949:390 ) . It explains why , despite her references to Ahalesimihi , Alipinagle , and Yapiaun as villages , they do not appear on her map of the Mountain Villages ( Mead 1938:156 ) : the villages marked on this map are actually the principal ceremonial centers of each locality . Finally , it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really an enlargement of the ideal village " ( Mead 1947:179 ) : the locality , in the sense of a ceremonial community writ large and centered on a principal ceremonial center , is indeed an enlargement of a village conceived of as a ceremonial community centered on a ceremonial center . <p> One final source of confusion in the Mountain Arapesh literature stems not from Mead and Fortune 's terminology but from dynamic tendencies within Mountain Arapesh social life itself that complicated any attempt to describe the system at a particular instant in time . The ceremonial communities of a locality occasionally split apart to form separate localities , as seems to have been the case with the origins of Kobelen and Umanep , and Liwo and Bugabiheim localities ( Mead 1947:184 , see also 1947:179 ) . Within a locality , ceremonial communities tended to emerge , change , and disappear . Manuniki , for example , once had been the ceremonial center for Alitoa ceremonial community , but by 1931 this honor had been inherited by Alitoa ceremonial center ( Mead 1947:263 ) . According to Mead ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manuniki 's demographic decline ; according to my informants , the reason was Alitoa 's superior defensibility . Whatever the cause , in 1932 " Manuniki was still regarded as a decayed village i.e. , ceremonial center , not as a small hamlet " ( Mead 1947:396fn.8 ) ; and reflecting this ambiguity , Mead distinguished it not only as a hamlet but also as a " large place " ( e.g. , Mead 1947:243,396 ) . <p> In the case of Alipinagle and Ahalesimihi , this sort of dynamic created more serious classificatory difficulties . " Alipinagle represented , though in less extreme form , the same tendencies as did Manuniki . It was a dying community , inhabited by various unfit and anti-social persons " ( Mead 1947:266 , see also 1947:265 ) . This transitional status was further complicated by its affiliation only three generations previously to Wihun , an entirely different locality ( Mead 1947:265 ) . Ahalesimihi , by contrast , was in the process of becoming a distinct ceremonial community : it was the " most prosperous hamlet in the Alitoa locality " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( i.e. , ceremonial community ) ( Mead 1947:257 ) . <p> Such historical changes seem to have been politically motivated . On the subject of Arapesh politics , Mead 's comments tend to be ambiguous . At times , she flatly states that there was " no competition among leaders " ( Mead 1937:41 ) ; yet leadership clearly conferred prestige ( Mead 19631935:139 ) , and " aggressiveness and competitiveness " were apparently appropriate in the exchange relationship by which boys learned to be big men ( Mead 1947:204 ) . Suffice it to say , her data strongly suggest that localities , ceremonial communities , and sho'ubeli wabul vied with one another in staging feasts , yam ceremonies , meat exchanges , etc. ( e.g. , Mead 1937:32-33 ; **26;187;TOOLONG ) , and that political considerations could prompt sho'ubeli wabul periodically to switch their ceremonial community allegiance or forge allegiances to more than one ceremonial community ( Mead 1947:208,257,39434A ) . The resultant fluidity in the network of political affiliations among sho'ubeli wabul and ceremonial communities , and the consequent flux in the identities of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , that locality was a misleading term to describe a social organization that was really " a series of overlapping circles " ( Mead 1932b ) . Whatever the case , the dynamics of change in Mountain Arapesh society probably contributed to her practice of referring to Alipinagle and Ahalesimihi sometimes as hamlets , sometimes as villages . THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFUSION <p> The absence of reliable maps of the mountain settlements , coupled with comments about " a scattered , seminomadic life " ( Mead 1937:20 , see also 1933:38 , 1947:268 ) , have led scholars to conclude that Mountain Arapesh population was " very thin " or " sparse " ( e.g. , Forge 1990:160 ; Tuzin 1976:3,82-83 ) . In light of the data presented here , these characterizations are difficult to defend . In the region of Mountain Arapesh territory best documented in Mead and Fortune 's writings , there were at least sixteen localities in a total area of approximately 175 square kilometers ( Figure 2 ) . 13 If these averaged about 225 +/- 50 residents , 14 the resulting density of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( 1977:72 ) estimate of 3.6/square kilometer is much too low but also that a large area of Mountain Arapesh territory was as densely populated as any Sepik group outside the Western latmul and the foothills between Yangoru and Dreikikir ( Roscoe 1986:2227 ) . Mead 's impression that Mountain Arapesh population was sparse may have stemmed from demographic levels she encountered in her Samoan , Sepik River , and Manus fieldwork , or from Alitoa locality 's unusually low density . At approximately 19 square kilometers in area ( Figure 1 ) , Alitoa had one of the more sprawling territories in the mountains , yielding a density of just 10.6/square kilometer . Since the rugged terrain and an injured ankle confined Mead to the immediate environs of Alitoa ceremonial center ( Mead 1972:230,242 ) , she was not to know that generalizing her impressions of local density to the Mountain Arapesh as a whole would be misleading . <p> A second confusion in the literature concerns the degree of nucleation in Mountain Arapesh settlement patterns . Forge ( 1972:364,371 ) refers to " nucleated " settlements of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ethnographic Atlas , which categorizes the settlement pattern as " separated hamlets where several such form a more or less permanent single community " ( Murdock 1967:159 ) . As Figure 1 makes clear , the Ethnographic Atlas is closer to the mark : a two-sector version of Clark and Evans 's ( 1954 ) index of nucleation ( Hodder and Orton 1976:38-40 ) applied to Alitoa locality settlements yields a ratio of observed to expected nearest neighbor distance of 0.86 ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , where 0 represents complete nucleation and 1 completely random settlement. 15 Apparently taking Alitoa ceremonial center as his guide , Forge assumed that this was the typical Mountain Arapesh settlement when , in fact , the sho'ubeli wabul was the more representative ; and he presumed that everyone affiliated to a ceremonial community lived in its ceremonial center , which they did not . Yet , the Ethnographic Atlas is not entirely correct either : Walinuba , Alitoa , and an unspecified number of other hamlets were contiguous , not separated ; and Mountain Arapesh hamlets formed two communities , the ceremonial community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error concerns the scale of Mountain Arapesh social organization . Hogbin and Wedgwood ( 1953:254 cfi243 ) describe the Arapesh hamlet as " the largest local group forming a political unit . " Likewise , Tuzin ( 1976:20 ) characterizes Mead 's " research base , Alitoa " as a " small , hamlet-sized community . " In fact , Alitoa was neither a small hamlet nor a small community , and the largest political unit was the locality , followed by the ceremonial community , and only then by the hamlet . <p> Finally , scholars have failed to distinguish the ceremonial community from the locality . Kaberry ( 1973:73fn ) equates the Mountain Arapesh " sovereign locality " to a " hamlet cluster , " when in fact the latter refers to a ceremonial community ( Mead 1947 : 272 ) . Rubel and Rosman ( 1978:67 ) describe the mountain localities as " made up of a number of hamlets " but then go on to talk of villages without distinguishing what they mean by this term . The reason , perhaps , is that they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and localities ( Rubel and Rosman 1978:68 ) ; and on at least one occasion , they use village to refer to a ceremonial community , Alipinagle ( Rubel and Rosman 1978:69 ) , while on other occasions they use it in reference to the locality ( Rubel and Rosman 1978:74,83,84,85 ) . CONCLUSION <p> The terminological confusions caused by the conjunction of Western semantics and Melanesian settlement patterns are by no means peculiar to the Mountain Arapesh record . As Hogbin and Wedgwood ( 1953:253 ) noted long ago , village commonly has been used to describe a local group , and this has been unfortunate : <p> for it suggests a degree of centralization , both of buildings and of social life , which is by no means always found . In practice , too , there is often some confusion as to whether the word signifies a social group or a geographical region . <p> Alas , Hogbin and Wedgwood 's remedy was a technical lexicon so formidable that it has been largely ignored by subsequent Melanesian scholarship . As a result , terminological problems persist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt of population in the foothills to the south of the Mountain Arapesh . <p> Here , among the Yangoru Boiken , the Abelam , the Bumbita Arapesh , and the Southern Arapesh we find references to villages scattered throughout the literature , conjuring images of nucleated sets of dwellings or hamlets in the country , each some distance from the other . Yet , a closer reading of the literature discloses that implicitly or explicitly the term has been deployed less in its material than in its social sense . Foothill " villages " usually turn out to refer to military alliances , political units , corporate units , and so on , rather than to nucleated sets of dwellings or hamlets ( e.g. , Forge 1970:258,261,264,271 ; Kaberry 1973:63-71 ; Roscoe 1991b:389 ; Tuzin 1976:56,77-78 ) . <p> These usages are hardly surprising for the sheer density of foothills ' settlements tends to dissolve villages as nucleated material entities . Gesch ( 1985:13 ) notes of Yangoru Boiken settlement patterns , for example , that " the hill villages form an almost continual residential pattern with only theoretical limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arapesh " have a settlement pattern which lacks well defined geographical boundaries at levels larger than the hamlet " ( Leavitt 1989:64 , see also 1989:47,62n ) ; " all the villages of the group are nearly contiguous along a single ridgetop " ( Tuzin 1976:77n ) . Among the North Wosera Abelam , almost every levee , ridge , and hilltop is carpeted with buildings , creating a situation where it is often difficult to distinguish any significant spatial nucleation beyond the hamlet level ( cf. , e.g. , Lea 1964:Fig. 18 ; TPNG 1971 ) . The point is that this sort of settlement pattern which , in the case of the Abelam , the Ethnographic Atlas characterizes as one of " compact and relatively permanent settlements , i.e. , nucleated villages or towns " ( Murdock 1967:159 ) , can be difficult to distinguish from that of Highland groups such as the Enga , which the Atlas and many other sources describe as " neighborhoods of dispersed family homesteads " ( Murdock 1967:159 ; see also Brown 1979:106 ) . The ratio of observed to expected mean distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lea 1964:Fig. 18 ) , for example , is 0.66 , only slightly more nucleated than the Raiapu Enga clan of Aruni ( Waddell 1972:29 ) with a ratio of 0.71 ( 0 represents complete nucleation and 1 completely random settlement ) . <p> There is no question that , even in some of the densest regions of the foothills , many " villages " are significantly nucleated ( e.g. , Kaberry 1941:239 ) . Nonetheless , the incautious deployment and interpretation of Western settlement terms here and elsewhere in the Melanesian record can and has generated a false impression of both its degree and prevalence . Fortunately , the remedy need not be as daunting as Hogbin and Wedgwood envisaged . The principal problematic terms being hamlet and village , the difficulty largely can be resolved by reserving these terms solely for situations where settlement patterns resemble those of the West : where the material , human , and social dimensions of settlements all coincide . Where these conditions do not prevail , some other , clearly specified set of terms should be substituted : say , settlement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an associated social group ( see also Filer 1990 ; Scaglion 1976:82 ) . <p>
