IN CASE YOU have n't noticed , Windows 98 and Internet Explorer 4 add tons of new toolbars to the screen . Just rightclick an empty area of the taskbar or one of its toolbars , select Toolbars , and choose one or more of the following options : Address gives you a handy command line for accessing Web sites , opening folders , and launching applications . Links is a good place to drag and drop favorite Web addresses and other objects . Quick Launch can hold the Show Desktop button and Shortcuts to any app or file . Desktop provides a quick way to access desktop objects when the desktop itself is obscured by open windows . New Toolbar creates a toolbar to show the contents of any folder . Though these toolbars represent potential time savers ( or at least dick savers ) , how do you cope with the visual noise they add ? Here are some ideas , many of which are illustrated in FIGURE 1 . Turn off what you do n't need : For example , the Links and the Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder Shortcuts and Web links . Drag the best items from one onto the other ; then nix the empty one . ( You remove a toolbar by right-clicking the taskbar , choosing Toolbars , and unchecking the toolbar 's name . ) And what about that Desktop toolbar ? If it 's cramping your taskbar , check out alternatives for getting to the desktop ( see " Better Ways to Your Desktop , " Windows Tips , June , page 285 ) . Go vertical : If you need two or three toolbars on screen , save space by dragging one or more of them to another edge of your screen . For example , you might keep the taskbar and the Quick Launch bar in a single vertical column on the left or right margin . But keep the Address toolbar , which needs a lot of horizontal space , at either the top or bottom of your screen . Float them : If screen real estate is n't an issue , you can simplify the taskbar by turning toolbars into floating palettes . Just position the pointer near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , if you 've hidden it ) and drag and drop to the desktop . Keep oft-used toolbars on top : If you frequently use objects on a floating palette , you can keep the palette accessible by right-clicking it and choosing Always on Top . Though toolbars lack Minimize buttons , clicking the Show Desktop button on the Taskbar will hide floating palettes ( except those set to be Always on Top ) . The palettes will reappear the next time you restore a window or dick Show Desktop . Create a folder toolbar : If you regularly access a folder of files , you can transform the entire folder into a toolbar with icons representing each file within . Simply drag the folder ( or a Shortcut to it ) to any edge of your screen to create an instant toolbar displaying the folder 's contents . Shrink icons and remove labels : Right-dick any toolbar and choose View.Small to shrink the icons , or uncheck Show Title to eliminate the toolbar 's title . Finally , you can save a lot of space by hiding the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose Show Text to uncheck this option . You can always hover the pointer over an icon until its explanatory " tool tip " appears . Hide what you do n't need : If you have additional toolbars on different edges of your screen , you can minimize clutter and gain space by right-clicking a toolbar and choosing Auto Hide . The toolbar will disappear when not in use but pop back into view when you move your pointer to its edge of the screen . Combine two or more into one : If you want multiple toolbars without cluttering the desktop , drag one toolbar onto an existing palette . Presto ! The two toolbars become a single connected palette , while maintaining the attributes ( icon size , visible titles or text , and so on ) ascribed to each . Drag the separator to adjust the space each gets , or drag any edge to resize the entire palette . You ca n't drag two floating toolbars together to form a single floating palette , but you can drag a toolbar from the taskbar and drop it onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rearrange buttons to suit your needs : Do n't rely on anyone else to put your toolbar buttons in the order that 's fastest or most logical to you . You can rearrange the buttons on any toolbar or palette just by dragging . In fact , you can do the same for anything on the Start menu . COPE WITH AN OVERCROWDED SCREEN WINDOWS SCREENS get cluttered fast , especially if you 're working on an older machine or laptop system that forces you to work in 640 by 480 resolution . Here are some coping strategies . Switch between maximized applications : The easiest way to minimize screen clutter is to maximize all open applications , switching between them by pressing &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;Tab&gt; . If you 're running a lot of applications , it may be quicker to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;Esc&gt; to open the Task List , and then double-click the application you want to switch to . Turn off unneeded toolbars : You can see more of your work if you turn off unnecessary toolbars or status bars ( check your documentation for details ) . Some applications let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the &lt;Tab&gt; key in Adobe Photoshop . Reveal hidden applications : If you keep your current application maximized , you can get easy access to other applications by pressing &lt;Alt&gt;-&lt;Esc&gt; . This tactic reveals icons for all open apps ; it works best if you keep the applications minimized . If all your apps are maximized , pressing &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Esc&gt; shows you the last-used window . See everything : To maximize the window you 're currently working in while retaining quick access to minimized applications , minimize all applications except the one you want to work in . Press &lt;Ctrl : - &lt;Esc&gt; to open the Task List , and click Tile ( or press &lt;AIt&gt;-T ) . Your window will fill the entire screen except for a small space at the bottom where Windows displays the icons of currently running applications . If you resize all windows this way and minimize the current application before restoring another , you can maintain this view for all applications throughout your session . Remove the labels : You can make Windows automatically push an application 's label below the bottom of the screen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect your icon arrangement in Program Manager , so first set up the icons in each Program Manager window the way you want them . Then select Options and make sure Auto Arrange is not checked . In the future , avoid using both this option and Window-Arrange Icons . Now press &lt;Shift&gt; as you choose File.Exit Windows to save your current Program Manager arrangement . With Program Manager taken care of , you can fix icons on the desktop : In Program Manager or File Manager , choose File.Run , type win.ini , and press &lt;Enter&gt; . Under the Desktop heading , look for a line that begins " IconVerticalSpacing= ' ' . ( If it 's not there , add it . ) Edit the value that follows the equal sign to something smaller . For example , values of 3o or lower will hide the entire icon label ( see FIGURE 2 ) , while values of around 50 will show one line of the label . Save the file and restart Windows to see the result . TILE FILE MANAGER YOUR WAY WINDOWS FOR Workgroups 3. zz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file windows vertically or horizontally . Choose Window.Tile Vertically or Window . Tile Horizontally . Windows 3. s , however , gives you only one option-Windows , Tile-which tiles windows horizontally . Fortunately , you can still tile windows vertically by holding &lt;Shift&gt; as you choose Windows . Tile . Or press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;F4&gt; to tile windows vertically in either version of Windows . To tile windows horizontally in Windows for Workgroups 3. ii , press &lt;Alt&gt;-W , then press H. In Windows 3.1 , press tAIt&gt;-W , then T. CHANGE YOUR FIND HOW DO I customize the Find Files or Folders command so that it will automatically search all of my hard drives and not just drive C : ? Wayne Lee , Edmonton , Alberta WINDOWS FIND COMMAND is n't the most cooperative of utilities . But with a little work-around , you can get it to start with the search parameters you desire . The trick lies in the Save Search function . // FIGURE 1 // In Windows 95 , choose Start.Find.Files or Folders . In the Named box , type the file specifications you prefer , separating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . For example , if you usually search for text files , you might type *. txt *. doc . ( Wild-card characters like * and ? are optional . ) In the Look in ' box , type the paths you use most often , separated by a semicolon ( plus an optional space ) -c : doc ; d : temp ; e : , for example . Use the Date Modified and Advanced tabs to limit the search by date , file type , size , or text content . When everything is set , click Find Now . If the resulting list of found items is one you expect to work with regularly , choose Options and make sure a check mark appears next to Save Results ' ' ; if it 's not there , select Save Results ( see FIGURE 3 ) . Now choose File-Save Search . Unfortunately , Windows does n't let you choose where to save the file or what to call it ; it simply appears on the desktop with a name of its own choosing-such as Files named @txt.fnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move it to a convenient location , such as a folder within the Start Menu folder . If you frequently perform a series of different searches , save each of them for fast access . Windows NT 4.0 , Windows 98 , and Internet Explorer 4 marginally improve customized finds . For starters , you can choose Local hard drives from the " Look in " drop-down box rather than typing in each path . And Win 98 and IE 4 save the last location you entered in the Look in ' box so you do n't have to choose File.Save Search . Unfortunately , no version of Windows preserves the Find window 's position or size . // FIGURE 2 // FIGURE 3 Footnote You 'll find files from this article at www.fileworld.com .
