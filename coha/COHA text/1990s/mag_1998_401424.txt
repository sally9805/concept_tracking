There often comes a point when you can either give up or push on no matter what . The hard part is figuring Headnote This is a place where hunters have often said , ' " No more : ' 1 // THE MOUNTAIN RISES LIKE A BIG LOAF OF BREAD ATOP THE sudden uplift of the Rocky Mountain Front west of Denver . At least it 's like a bread loaf before the snow flies , for the crest is entirely above timberline , and its cap of dark moss and lichen give it the color of whole wheat . The mountain has a name , but sve call it Mutiny Mountain because it 's a place where hunters have often said , " No more . " If vou can cross the mountain to the back side , you 'll find a series of perfect Alpine basins that slope downward several hundred yards to the first fingers of timber , low aspen , and scraggly fir , which build rapidly into dense forest . These high meadows and the dark timber below create the perfect elk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force them down , there are herds of elk on Mutiny Mountain . They bed in the dark timber below , where it 's almost impossible to hunt them . In the evening , they filter upward , where they feed and rut in the high basins throughout the night . In the morning , they reverse course and drift back down into their timbered sanctuary . THERE ARE VANTAGE POINTS THAT , FROM A DISTANCE , allow you to glass into the basins and meadows that drop off Mutiny Mountain . Of an early autumn morning or evening , you can almost always glass the tawny forms of elk here . Getting to them is another story . A few years back my outfitter buddy , Tom Tietz , glassed a big bull , a magnificent elk with seven good points on each side . Tom got his hunter up the mountain , across the rounded top , and onto the ridge on the back side . They needed to cover another quarter mile , and then they could look down into the first basin and shoot the elk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No more . " He was n't the only hunter to quit on Mutiny Mountain-but it was he who gave it its name . If that last quarter mile was really beyond him , then he did the right thing . Someday we all reach a point where we can do no more . The trick is knowing if it 's real or if it 's time to take a deep breath and push forward anyway . The problem with Mutiny Mountain is that when you take that deep breath , it comes above 12,000 feet . THE EVENING BEFORE THE SEAson , we made our way to a lookout . This part was easy ; a road brought us close , and we had only to sidehill up a few hundred yards . In that short distance I felt the pull in my flatland legs , and my sea-level lungs complained . We set up the spotting scope on a knife ridge . Mutiny Mountain loomed above and to our left , but from here we could look past the mountain and into the series of undulating basins that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the elk were already there . A vast herd was spread out and feeding . There were tan cows and larger , paler bodies . The distance was too great and the light too far gone to count points , but we could catch the occasional hint of antlers . A few made their sex obvious by sparring in the graying brush or stretching out their dark necks to bugle . Before light left us , we counted more than 20 bulls . The moon was bright when we left the truck at three the next morning . Picking our way slowly through low brush and jumbled rock , we could walk without flashlights . Tom knew the general route , but we could n't really see ahead . Sometimes that 's better . Stopping often to blow , we made the top of Mutiny Mountain . Slowly we made our way along the bread loaf , skirting the boulders of dimly seen side canyons . The sky was pink behind us when we reached the junction of the mountain and the sharper ridge to the west . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep shadow . We waited while the light grew , shivering from chilled sweat . In the earliest gray , we could see the first basin far below . It was empty . This was expected ; the elk should have fed uphill through the night , and we should find them somewhere along the high , open ridge . Except the ridge was also empty . Beyond the first basin , just above some of the uppermost fingers of trees , a herd of tawny forms trooped out of a little cut , headed down . Perhaps there was too much moon , and they 'd finished feeding . Although it was not quite dawn on opening day , we were almost too late . Two fine bulls trailed the cow herd , their lilting bugles echoing up through the still air . " We still have a chance , " Tom said , stuffing his binoculars under his vest . " Can you run ? " Probably not , I thought , gulping oxygen . I kept that to myself and just nodded . Tom took off . Cinching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and launched after him . The first few hundred yards were easy-straight down the mountain to the cover of the first basin . Then we would have to sidehill west , cross the intervening ridge , and just maybe intercept the elk in the first strands of timber in the next valley . We dropped more than 1,000 feet at a slipping , sliding jog . Despite the downhill , my chest ached and my breath was a harsh rattle long before we reached the first dwarfed firs . Tom looked back to make sure I was with him then angled to the left , following a game trail that wandered along a little shelf above the first trees . With the footing less treacherous now , he speeded up , and the time had come for me to quit and let the elk win this round ... or to suck it up and go . It was possible . I 'm a runner ; I just do n't run at 11,000 feet . But I was no longer on an elk mountain . I was back in Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was on a platoon run . All that mattered in the world was keeping pace with the man in front of me . I plunged ahead , and we skirted the trees , crossing through a narrow fringe of timber to look into the basin beyond . We pulled up short behind a screen of gnarled conifers , Tom looking and me doubled over , gasping , hands braced on knees . We were too late ; the second basin was also empty . Then , just below us , hidden behind one of the narrow fingers of altitudestunted trees , a three-note bugle sounded . Tom looked at me carefully . He was no longer the Great Satan , my platoon sergeant , just Tom-a little younger , a lot thinner , and a whole lot more used to altitude than I. " Are you okay ? We can still catch them if we hurry . " I straightened up , nodding . Maybe 400 yards . I could do it . Trotting again , we followed the trees down , then circled back up . A bugle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next finger of timber . Slowly now , we crossed the opening . I loaded the chamber , tried to get some air , and side by side we stepped into the trees . THE ELK WERE JUST ON THE FAR side , tan cows dimly seen , and then a big bull , viewed through a fringe of aspen as if behind a picket fence . He bugled again , not 30 yards from us . I got the rifle up but could n't hold it steady . The crosshairs did lazy eights , wobbling from buff shoulder to white aspen and back again . I took a breath , but it did no good . Trying to time the wobble , I finished the squeeze . The rifle went off , and bark flew . I 'd hit a tree . The herd shifted , uncertain , while I frantically worked the bolt . The bull danced to the left , then stopped . More bark flew-another tree . Spots danced before my eyes . I threw the bolt again while the herd shifted left , panicked now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neck and shoulder came into a narrow lane . No longer under my control , the rifle went off again . This time the bull collapsed . We ran to him , pure adrenaline at work , and I took in the six long points and thick beams . Then I collapsed as well , sinking into the low heather and trying to suck oxygen into my starved lungs . A long time later , still shaky , I could run my hands over those walnut antlers and enjoy the warm sunlight just hitting this sheltered basin . LATER THAT DAY , WITH A PACKFRAME full of elk , I struggled my way slowly and painfully back to the top of Mutiny Mountain . On the crest of the bread loaf , I turned around and eased the heavy load back against the slope , letting myself down into a thick carpet of lichen . I sat for a long time , looking west across those lovely basins to the shining mountains beyond . A warm sun cut through the cool breeze , and the two together quickly dried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sparse Alpine grass , and the same sunlight that I bathed in glinted off distant snowcaps along the crest of the Rockies . The tension drained from my tired legs and back , and , more slowly , my breathing returned to some semblance of normal . I lay back against the pack and watched a couple of high , fluffy clouds drift across the deep-blue sky . Sometimes " No more " is the right answer-but I was thankful I did n't say it on that perfect day on that perfect mountain . <p>                     @x The Drowntown day market was in full spate . Fawn 's nostrils flared at the strong smells : fish , clams , critters with twitching legs like giant crawdads packed in seaweed ; frying funnel cakes , boiling crabs , dried fruit , cheeses ; piles of used clothing not well laundered ; chickens , goats , sheep , horses . Mixed with it all , the damp tang of the river Gray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter morning light . <p> The lead-colored water shimmered in silence beyond the bright busy blot of folks collected under the bluffs that divided Graymouth 's Uptown from its noisier  --  and , Fawn had to admit , more noisome  --  riverside . The muddy banks were lined with flatboats at the ends of their journeys , keelboats preparing new starts , and fishing and coastal vessels that came and went more in rhythm with the still-ten-miles-distant sea than with the river 's moods . The streets dodged crookedly around goods-sheds , rivermen 's taverns , and shacks  --  all built of dismantled flatboats , or , in some cases , not dismantled but drawn ashore intact on rollers by oxen and allowed to settle into the soil . The owners of the latter claimed to be all ready for the next flood that would try , and fail , to wash the smells and mess of Drowntown out to sea , while Uptown looked down dry-skirted . It seemed a strange way to live . How had she ever thought of the rocky creek at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fawn shoved her basket up her arm , nudged her companion Remo , and pointed . " Look ! There 's some new Lakewalkers here this morning ! " <p> At the other end of the square , where all the bigger animals were displayed by their hopeful owners , two women and a man tended a string of half a dozen leggy horses . The three all wore Lakewalker dress : riding trousers , sturdy boots , shirts and leather vests and jackets , not so different in kind from the farmers around them , yet somehow distinctive . More distinctive was their hair , worn long in decorated braids , their height , and their air of discomfort to be surrounded by so many people who were n't Lakewalkers . Upon reflection , Fawn wondered if anyone else here realized the standoffishness was discomfort , or if they only thought it high-nosed disdain . She would have seen it that way , once . <p> " Mm , " said Remo unenthusiastically . " I suppose you want to go talk to them ? " <p> " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the market . <p> The man pulled a horse out of the string and held it for a farmer , who bent and ran his hands over its legs . The two young women looked toward Fawn and Remo as they approached ; their eyes widened a bit at Remo , whose height , clothes , and long black braid also proclaimed him a Lakewalker patroller . Did their groundsenses reached out to touch the stranger-kinsman , or did they keep them closed against the painful ground noise of the surrounding farmers ? <p> The southern Lakewalkers Fawn had seen so far tended to lighter skin and hair than their northern cousins , and these two were no exception . The taller woman  --  girl  --  she seemed not so very much older than Fawn , anyhow  --  had hair in a single thick plait as tawny as a bobcat pelt . Her silvery-blue eyes were bright in her fine-boned face . The shorter woman had red-brown braids wreathing her head , and coppery eyes in a round face dusted with freckles . Fawn thought they might be patrol partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sisters . <p> " ' Morning ! " Fawn called cheerfully , looking up at them . The top of her own dark curls came up just past the middle of Remo 's chest , and not much farther on these women . At almost-nineteen , Fawn had given up hope of gaining further inches except maybe around , and resigned herself to a permanent crick in her neck . <p> The reddish-haired woman returned a nod ; the bobcat blonde , seeming uncertain how to take the odd pair , addressed herself to a height halfway between them . " ' Morning . You all interested in a horse ? We 've some real fine bloodstock , here . Strong hooves . One of these could carry a man all the way up the Tripoint Trace and never pull up lame . " She gestured toward the string , well brushed despite their winter coats , who gazed back and flicked their tufted ears . Beyond , the Lakewalker man trotted the horse toward and away from the farmer , who stood hands on hips , frowning judiciously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to farmers ? " said Fawn innocently . The redhead 's slight flinch was more from guilt than insult , Fawn thought . Some horse traders . Suppressing a grin , she went on : " Anyhow , no , at least not today . What I was wondering was , what camp you folks hailed from , and if you have any real good medicine makers there . " <p> The blonde replied at once , in a practiced-sounding tone , " Lakewalkers ca n't treat farmers . " <p> " Oh , I know all about that . " Fawn tossed her head . " I 'm not asking for myself . " <p> Two braided heads turned toward Remo , who blushed . Remo hated to blush , he 'd said , because the awkwardness of it always made him blush worse than the original spur . Fawn watched his deepening tinge with fascination . She could not sense the flick of questing groundsenses , but she had no doubt that a couple went by just then . " No , I 'm not sick , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Are you two together ? " asked the blonde , silver-blue eyes narrowing in a less friendly fashion . Lovers together , Fawn guessed she meant to imply , which Lakewalkers were emphatically not supposed to be with farmers . <p> " Yes . No ! Not like that . Fawn 's a friend , " said Remo . " The wife of a friend , " he added in hasty emphasis . <p> " We still ca n't help you . Medicine makers ca n't fool with farmers , " the redhead seconded her companion . <p> " Dag 's a Lakewalker . " Fawn shouldered forward , keeping herself from clutching the Lakewalker wedding braid circling her left wrist under her sleeve . Or brandishing it , leading to the eternal explanation and defense of its validity . " And he 's not sick . " Exactly . " He used to be a patroller , but he thinks he has a calling now for making . He already knows lots , and he can do some , some amazing things , which is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his next step . " Whatever it is . Even Dag did not seem sure , to Fawn 's concerned eyes . <p> <br> Continues ...
