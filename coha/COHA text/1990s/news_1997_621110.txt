<p> SUBURBANITES SHOULD STOP WHINING <p> Editor  --  It 's hard to commiserate with suburban commuters who were miffed at BART strikers leaving them stranded . A person living in Walnut Creek or Pittsburg and working 20 to 30 miles away in San Francisco was not " inconvenienced " by BART strikers , he or she was merely stupid ! Urban citizens are disgusted with overprivileged , pampered suburbanites . We 've catered to them for much too long . <p> We 've created whole new towns for these people , built their water systems , sewer systems , streets and schools , paid for their parks and transmission lines and fire protection , all so they can " have a better life . " Yet , they always want more : freeways that cost $ 4,000 an inch , tax breaks ( federal , state and local ) on their houses , the right to run over bicyclists and pedestrians . In our modern equation , suburbanite equals selfishness , plus self-preoccupation . <p> A little frustration ? I say " let ' em walk " ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving farther away . If they do n't want the difficulties of commuting , they can give up their lawns and pseudo-mansions and move closer to the job . Just stop whining ! <p> STEVE TABOR <p> Alameda <p> . <p> AN ELEGANT SOLUTION <p> Editor  --  As we all know , the traffic situation in the Bay Area is already abysmal even without our regular traffic crises . Our transportation agencies respond to these crises dependably , by adding buses and ferries , encouraging car pools and begging us to be patient . Yet there is an easy , elegant solution to such crises : simply restrict passage through the key choke points such as the affected bridges and tunnels to two-person car pools during rush hours . <p> Instead of vainly adding capacity and worsening congestion , this would dramatically reduce congestion during the peak times . Perhaps some of the impromptu car pools formed during these crises might survive them and lead to reduced traffic in general . Fair enough ? Or is it preferable to collectively feel sorry for ourselves and blame others ? <p> MICHEL FLOYD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor  --  Your September 10 editorial questioning the decision by the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) to allow Conoco to begin exploratory oil drilling in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah was right on target . <p> The decision by the BLM , an agency that has a history of kowtowing to industry , is even more alarming because , despite its claim to the contrary , Conoco has a less than stellar environmental record . Just last month a federal jury found Conoco guilty of contaminating local water supplies and the wells of two mobile home parks in Wrightsboro , N.C. , and awarded residents of the mobile home parks $ 9.5 million for medical monitoring of possible illnesses caused by exposure to gasoline in their water . The jury said that the company acted willfully and negligently , which could result in further damage awards . <p> Is this the kind of environmental steward President Clinton envisioned for the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument when he created it ? I certainly hope not . <p> CELIA BAROTZ <p> San/ Francisco <p> . <p> NERT PROGRAM <p> Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the San Francisco Fire Commission , wrote about the SFFD 's continuing efforts to meet community needs . <p> In her discussion , she should have included the SFFD 's Neighborhood Emergency Response Teams , also known as the NERT program . After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake , the Fire Department wisely realized that major disasters like that would overwhelm it . Each neighborhood in the city now has volunteers whom Fire Department personnel have trained in basic rescue skills , first aid and fire suppression . <p> San Francisco residents can obtain more information about the program , as well as schedules of upcoming training sessions , by calling the Fire Department . <p> MARK MACKLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> IMAGINE . . . <p> Editor  --  Imagine being jolted awake at 4:45 a.m. each morning by a spine-chilling screech and a trembling house . <p> Imagine this piercing sound penetrating the vibrating walls of your home at intervals of 3 to 15 minutes all day long and into the late evening . <p> Imagine a roar and a shriek followed by a howl beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whine following you , building to a scream at every intersection , as you walk to the grocery store . <p> Imagine watching the walls of the home your family has lived in for generations , cracking around you . <p> Imagine being so tired you ca n't think . <p> Imagine no escape . <p> Imagine living with the Bredas . <p> MARYALICE REINMULLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN <p> Editor  --  It 's disappointing to see that Joel Ventresca apparent ly plans to make his campaign for city treasurer a negative one . His signs went up all over the city recently and it is obvious that he has no intention to discuss the issues . He does not tout his own accomplishments . Instead , he chooses to attack " politicians . " <p> The job of treasurer is not one to be taken lightly , despite the lack of a high-profile campaign for the office in recent years . The treasurer is the guardian of San Francisco 's nearly $ 3 billion in assets and must not only preserve the city 's solvency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a financially sound and socially responsible manner . <p> Surely , Mr. Ventresca , who positions himself as the neighborhood activist " anti-politician , " can do better than to open this campaign with a negative attack . I hope we can have a race that relies on issues and qualifications so that voters have an opportunity to choose the best candidate for the job . <p> IAN SELDEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> COTTON WAGES <p> Editor  --  Recently you ran an article regarding a couple that are volunteers with the U.S. Forest Service in the Trinity Alps . Your opening paragraph refers to the couple making $ 25 a day , " wages you 'd expect to see on a cotton farm in the San Joaquin Valley . " <p> Just to set the record straight , from the heart of the San Joaquin Valley Cotton Country , according to the Farm Employers Labor Service 1997 Wage Survey , general laborers average $ 6.28 per hour and supervisors average $ 11.35 with a high end in the survey of $ 23 per hour . <p> We suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents an hour " perpetuates inaccurate myths about this nation 's number one industry  --  agriculture . <p> DAVID SHARP <p> President <p> Tulare County Farm Bureau <p> Visalia <p> . <p> CELEBRITY NONSENSE <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle just does n't get it . If Pat Steger is reporting what Sean Penn had for dinner ( Chronicle , September 8 ) and Ruthe Stein ( Chronicle , September 11 ) is reporting that Kim Bassinger showed plenty of cleavage at a film festival and Alec Baldwin munched on a slice of pizza , among other useless bits of information , why does n't it make sense to everyone that the paparazzi would be hounding Princess Diana to record every sneeze she made or what color her toes were painted ? <p> When will The Chronicle get a grasp on this celebrity nonsense ? It does n't do any publication proud that calls itself a " serious rag . " <p> STEVE CHAIKIN <p> Oakland <p> . <p> NOT SO COOL <p> Editor  --  Marilyn Ross ' Saturday letter is an insult to swellness and coolness . Is nothing sacred ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give her a break when she cuts me some slack . So , Marilyn , what 's knittn ' , kitten ? You 're just too cute ! <p> DON NESLAND <p> San Francisco
