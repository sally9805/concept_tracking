<p> In searching for ways to reduce staggering health care costs , diet improvement is an idea whose time has come . In February 1995 , the Economic Research Service ( ERS ) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) issued a report* that provides information on the incidence , prevalence , and costs of health conditions commonly associated with poor diets . The dollar estimates include direct health care costs and lost productivity . <p> The four most important problems of heart disease , cancer , stroke , and diabetes account for more than 1.4 million deaths annually in the United States . All are diet-related . Diet also plays a role in obesity , high blood pressure , and osteoporosis . Taken together , these diet-related health conditions cost Americans an estimated $250 billion yearly . The extent to which these costs might be reduced by diet improvement can not be calculated precisely , but some researchers estimate that proper diet might forestall at least 20% of the annual deaths from heart disease , cancer , stroke , and diabetes . <p> Coronary heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $56.3 billion yearly . Health professionals estimate that 20% of these deaths could be avoided by dietary changes . CHD is associated , too , with obesity , diabetes , and high blood pressure . All of these conditions respond favorably to dietary changes . <p> According to the American Cancer Society , overall costs for cancer total $104 billion each year in America . Yet it is estimated that U.S. cancer death rates could be reduced by as much as 35% by " practicable dietary means . " These estimates include the effects of overeating and subsequent obesity ; of ingesting naturally-occurring carcinogens , such as aflatoxin in grain ; of carcinogens produced by cooking or storing , such as polycyclic hydrocarbons produced when meat is heavily broiled or smoked ; and of cancer-enhancing or cancer-inhibiting substances that affect the formation of carcinogens in the body , such as nitrates or antioxidants respectively . <p> The American Heart Association estimates that some three million Americans suffer from stroke-related disabilities , at an annual cost of nearly $20 billion . Health professionals estimate that at least 20% of stroke deaths could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association estimates that diabetes affects more than 13 million Americans , half of whom are not even aware of their health problem . Total economic cost of diabetes is more than $90 billion annually , which includes costs associated with cardiovascular disease , responsible for more than half of all deaths of diabetics . It is estimated that 40% of all diabetic cases are preventable by weight control through dietary measures and exercise . <p> Numerous other health conditions , including obesity , high blood pressure , and osteoporosis , are influenced by diet . Although faulty diet may not be a direct cause of death , some of these health conditions reduce the quality of life and contribute to premature death . For example , obesity and high blood pressure are risk factors for CHD and stroke . Osteoporosis is responsible for one-and-a-half-million bone fractures yearly , especially of the hip , spine , and wrist . Hip fractures alone result in an estimated $10 billion in annual medical costs in the United States . <p> American Diet Shortcomings . Despite efforts to address obesity as a public health problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Americans has increased dramatically . Currently , one-third of all adults aged 20 to 74 are considered overweight . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , on average , Americans are now nearly eight pounds heavier than they were ten years ago . The economic cost of illness associated with obesity was estimated , in 1986 , to total more than $39 billion annually ( $11.3 billion for diabetes , $22.2 billion for cardiovascular diseases , $1.5 billion for high blood pressure , $1.9 billion for breast and colon cancer , and $2.4 billion for gall bladder disease ) . <p> Hundreds of low-fat foods have been introduced in the marketplace , purportedly to help consumers maintain proper body weight . Instead of helping to reduce obesity , these products have actually led to obesity . Many people believe that if a food is low in fat , they can have as many servings as they want , without gaining weight . The low-fat foods may have fewer calories from fat , but more calories from carbohydrates . <p> Similarly , food and beverage products made with low- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people believe , mistakenly , that they can indulge freely if a food or beverage is low in caloric sweeteners . <p> The types of foods chosen by Americans have changed considerably in the past few decades . Americans are eating more grain products , more cheese , and fewer eggs . They are drinking less whole milk , but more low-fat and skim milk , and far more soft drinks . They are consuming more mixed dishes in which meat , poultry , and fish are the main ingredients . This shift toward mixed dishes may increase the total fat intake through food preparation practices that incorporate hidden fat . Also , deep-fat frying and snack foods with high-fat levels have increased . Meal patterns , too , have changed , with more snacking , and a larger proportion of food eaten away from home . More foods eaten at home have been prepared elsewhere . <p> The foods being consumed by Americans provide the Recommended Dietary Allowances ( RDAs ) for some nutrients , but not for others . Nutrients below the RDAs  --  which in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calcium , and zinc . ( See " Revising the Official Nutrition Standards , " page 8 . ) <p> Surveys show that consumers are eating more grains but fewer vegetables than a decade ago . Less than 30% of the population has the recommended number of at least five daily servings of fruits and vegetables . Furthermore , high-fat vegetables contribute to overall high-fat consumption , with one-third of all potatoes grown in the United States processed into frozen products , mainly french fries . <p> Although the National Cancer Institute recommends eating foods that provide 20 to 30 grams of fiber daily , the average intake is well below the recommended level , on average , only 13 grams . <p> Currently , it is impossible to know the total sugar consumption because the nutrient database used in surveys does not include this information . The ERS food supply data suggest that consumption of added sugars is increasing , with an average consumption more than one-third of a pound per person each day ( as of 1992 ) . This is equivalent to more than 40 teaspoons per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any quantitative recommendation for sugar limits , the USDA 's Food Guide suggests examples for average upper amounts of added sugars : an individual on a 1,600-calorie diet should limit intake of added sugars to six teaspoons each day ; on a 2,200-calorie diet , 12 teaspoons ; and on a 2,800-calorie diet , 18 teaspoons . These suggested upper limits are far less than the average amounts being consumed . Because sugars are used mainly as ingredients in processed foods ( e.g. , baked goods ) and in processed beverages ( e.g. , soft drinks ) it is difficult for consumers to know their actual sugar intake , or to be aware that their intake is increasing . ( See " Confusing Consumers About Sugar Intake , " CR , January 1995 . ) <p> Past Report Ignored . For health professionals , the recent ERS report on the economic and health consequences of the American diet is all too familiar . In 1971 , the USDA issued a report** noting that major as well as minor health problems are diet-related . " Most of the health problems underlying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by improvement in diet . . . . Expenditures for health care in the U.S. are skyrocketing , accounting for $67.2 billion in 1970  --  or 7% of the entire U.S. gross national product . " <p> The 1971 report , which cost $30 million from federal funding , was issued and promptly withdrawn . Prepared by a joint task group drawn from the Human Nutrition Research Division of the USDA and state universities and land grant colleges , the 129-page report demonstrated the relationship of poor nutrition to health problems . These included cardiovascular , respiratory , and infectious diseases , mental and emotional health , reproduction and infant mortality , early aging and lifespan , arthritis and rheumatism , dental health , diabetes and carbohydrate disorders , osteoporosis , obesity , anemia , and other nutrient-related deficiencies , alcoholism , eye conditions , skin and hair disorders , and cancer . The report also included information on the shortcomings of the average American diet , and the nutrient intakes below the RDAs . The main points of the report were that major and minor health problems are diet-related , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to many illnesses can be found in good nutrition . The real potential from improved diet is preventive , insofar as it may defer or modify the development of disease states . <p> There is no clear answer why the 1971 report was withdrawn . One can only speculate . In 1983 , a similar event occurred in Great Britain , where a group of food scientists had been asked to formulate guidelines for good health maintenance and disease prevention . The report contained findings and recommendations similar to those of the 1971 U.S. report : reduce fat and sugar consumption ; increase the use of fresh vegetables and fruits , complex carbohydrates , and fibers ; and prevent deficiencies in nutrients such as folate , vitamin C , and iron . A spokesman for British food processors denounced the report as having " far-reaching economic implications worldwide " that would follow from substantial reductions in sugar and fat consumption . The British Department of Health and Social Security , pressured , was forced to withold publication of its report . <p> Although the USDA 's 1971 report was withdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nutrition and Human Needs in its investigations during the 1970s . In the intervening years , much information has filtered down to the public that makes a reasonable case for associating a good diet with good health , and , conversely , a poor diet with health problems . <p> With attempts to reduce health care costs , the time may be more favorable to implement the recommendations made in the 1995 report . In the words of The Surgeon General 's Report on Nutrition and Health in 1988 : " For the two out of three adult Americans who do not smoke and do not drink excessively , one personal choice seems to influence long-term health prospects more than any other : what we eat .

Washington State residents add 7.85% tax . Diets Fall Short <p> Most diets today still fall short of meeting federal recommendations . Some possible reasons why diets still fall short include : Lack of belief . Many consumers do not believe they can control chronic disease or that changing their diet is very important . Lack of motivation . Some consumers believe that a low-fat diet is more costly and less tasty . Others confess to being confused , and still others erroneously believe their diets are healthy already . Lack of knowledge . Many consumers have mistaken concepts about the fat content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lean ground beef is low in fat and that white bread is high in fat . Ineffective changes . Although women with higher education made greater changes in their diets within the past two decades than did women with less education , these changes did not significantly reduce overall fat intake . Basically , the highly educated women traded fat from one source for another , such as from red meats to dairy products . Health is just one aspect of eating . People make food choices on the basis of a variety of considerations , such as income , convenience , cultural habits , and psychological satisfaction . Choosing a healthful diet requires changing attitudes , behavior , and eating practices , as well as having a commitment to change . <p> The American Diet : Health and Economic Consequences , U.S. Dept. of Agriculture . <p> <p> By Beatrice Trum Hunter <p> <p> Mrs. Hunter is CR 's food editor . <p>
