<p> We 're a bit perplexed by your recent editorial opposing the Charitable Giving Relief Act , legislation proposed by Rep. Phil Crane ( R-Ill. ) that would give individuals who do not itemize the opportunity to receive a tax deduction for their charitable contributions . <p> The editorial says that this legislation would serve only to make filling out the IRS 1040 EZ Form more difficult and that legislators should focus on making the entire tax system simpler and fairer for everyone . <p> Your logic escapes us . Americans contribute $ 120 billion annually to charities and nonprofit organizations . While Ted Turner , Bill Gates and George Soros get all the media attention  --  as well as hefty tax breaks  --  seven out of 10 Americans who contribute to charities are of lower to middle incomes or are elderly , and most of them do not itemize their taxes . <p> Fairness is at the heart of this proposed legislation . While not intended to be any sort of major tax overhaul , it provides the same opportunities for charitable deduction that itemizers have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax specialists for help  --  non-itemizers would be able to get credit for their charitable deductions on the form they already are using . The 1040 EZ form would require two or three additional lines to accommodate this . <p> According to Price Waterhouse research , if the Charitable Giving Relief Act were to become law , more than $ 2.6 billion in charitable contributions would be generated . Eighty-four million Americans , or 71 percent of all taxpayers , could potentially benefit . Why let a simple technical change stand in the way of a significant increase in giving ? <p> Studies show that most Americans do n't decide to contribute to charity for the tax benefits , but because they have a personal interest in a particular charity or organization . However , the amount they give often is determined by tax considerations . <p> With the cutbacks in government funding and increased competition for contributions , charitable organizations face many challenges as they try to serve their constituents . This bill , while giving relief for the average taxpayer , would provide the opportunity for millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Lies , <p> president , <p> Donors Forum of Chicago , <p> Loop <p> By e-mail <p> A blow for fairness <p> After the Illinois Supreme Court effectively threw out the personal injury cap on Dec. 18 , House Minority Leader Lee A. Daniels ( R-Elmhurst ) said " the decision is one giant step backward for Illinois " ( Letters , Dec. 26 ) rather than an example of sloppy legislation on his part . <p> Regardless of the injury , Daniels and a few insurance companies felt that it was fair to set a limit on a person 's justice . But fair to whom ? <p> I believe the Illinois Supreme Court did not see the legislation as an attempt by some politicians to pay back the big insurance companies for large campaign contributions , but ruled that justice of " one size fits all " was unfair to those affected by the statute . <p> Clearly , the decision by the court was a huge victory for the people of the state . Those with wealth and power will be much more careful about stepping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park <p> In praise of LSCs <p> Your Dec. 15 editorial ( " School council praise " ) was right on target . <p> This report by the Consortium on Chicago School Research confirmed that the shared decision-making process we have instituted in Chicago does work . <p> Your editorial and the report both highlight the important role and success of local school councils . This viewpoint affirms my own experience as principal of the John Spry Community School , where the LSC was our greatest resource . <p> The great majority of local school councils work hard and make significant contributions to their schools without payment , recognition or public praise . <p> It has been proven many times over that when schools really do connect to the communities they serve , there is no better way to develop school improvement plans , budgets or to select a principal . <p> The power of this movement must continue as we get ready for our next LSC elections April 8 and 9 . During the last election the number of candidates and voters and the degree of interest increased greatly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Azcoitia , <p> deputy chief education officer , <p> Chicago Public Schools <p> If you were a tree . . . <p> Within days of each other , accidents involving skiers running into trees claimed the lives of two celebrities . It seems to me a serious problem has not been addressed : Trees kill ! <p> Obviously this fact has been a " silent crisis " for a long time but now that it is out of the woods , so to speak , it can be ignored no longer . What this crisis demands is yet another TV performance by President Clinton  --  teary eyed , biting lower lip , holding hands with Hillary  --  the kind of presidential leadership we have grown accustomed to . <p> There are many available options . Every tree on or near a ski run may have to be labeled : " Warning ! Hitting this tree while skiing downhill at 40 miles per hour could be hazardous to your health ! " <p> Vice President Al Gore could chair another commission to study the feasibility of creating softer tree trunks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children the importance of not skiing into trees . <p> We all could wear lapel ribbons ( colored the wood stain of your choice ) to show our solidarity in this crisis . <p> Ed Willneff , Oak Park <p> Merry Solstice <p> Darel Jevens may have a valid point about the secular , commercial trappings of Christmas being stretched too far into January , but his comment that , " Once the new year begins , the rule becomes : zero tolerance , " misses a major item of import regarding the season . <p> Christmas is a religious holiday with a period that extends until the Epiphany on Jan. 6 . For Eastern Orthodox Christians , Jan. 6 is celebrated as Christmas itself . With this in mind , some of us will keep our Christmas trees lit and sing songs of the savior 's birth despite what the secular calendar may tell us . <p> For people who are uncomfortable with the religious basis of Christmas and who would like to see it fit more squarely into a purely secular world , I 'd like to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a nice tight window for celebration ( exactly one day ) and links your rituals to a purely astronomical phenomenon . There 's no messy spiritual baggage ! <p> John Zielinski , Lynwood <p> By e-mail <p> Demise exaggerated <p> After reading the comments from a reader ( Letters , Dec. 29 ) regarding the condition of the McKinley Park area , I felt compelled to respond . <p> Respectfully , I must question the description that this community has become a " sad place " in disrepair with rampant graffiti , abandoned cars , burned-out street lights and a lack of professionalism and courtesy from the 11th Ward representatives . <p> On the contrary , McKinley Park is alive and well thanks to the efforts of the residents , Deering District police officers , business leaders and other organizations that participate in the CAPS program and other local initiatives . <p> Many of us felt a sense of loss with the resignation of former Ald. Patrick Huels . But since his departure , I have not seen or experienced any increase in the problems of the 11th Ward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree with Arianna Huffington 's column ( " Drug pushers not always in alley , " Jan. 4 ) , which criticized drug companies pushing mood-altering drugs to children . Even though some mind-altering drugs are legal , they are decadent and habit-forming . <p> Taking happy pills only makes you feel good without solving any of your problems . <p> David Youngerman , Elgin <p> Man 's inhumanity <p> Your Showcase story ( Jan. 4 ) , headlined " Fur real ? Designers embrace the controversial coats , " prompted me to write this letter . Here are the some " fur real " facts . <p> Each fall and winter we see Chicagoans dressed in furs . These are people who still believe that it 's acceptable to exploit animals for their fur even though fur-bearing animals are killed in most inhumane ways . The preferred methods are breaking the neck ; gassing with hot carbon monoxide , which burns the eyes and lungs ; poisoning ; tying an animal upside down and bashing its head , and anal electrocution . <p> Both trapped and ranched animals suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 minks are killed for one coat . A fox coat signifies 18 dead foxes , and an astonishing 100 chinchillas are killed for one coat . More than 30 rabbits are slain for one coat  --  not to mention the countless beavers , otters , sables , raccoons and lynxes slaughtered each year . <p> The true cost of a fur coat is enormous cruelty and suffering . <p> JoAnne Rosenfeld , Naperville <p> Moose and squirrel <p> Well , the plug is being pulled on the " Seinfeld " show . <p> So much for the daily trials and tribulations of an annoying band of narcissistic neurotics . Personally , I hardly think that it 's cause for any national mourning . <p> It 's not like when " Rocky and Bullwinkle " went off the air . <p> William E. Carsley , <p> Lincoln Park
