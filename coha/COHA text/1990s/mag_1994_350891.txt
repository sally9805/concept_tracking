Dr. Baruch Goldstein was so blinded by enmity toward Arabs as to seem " batty " even to some of his fellow ultranationalist , fervently religious neighbors in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba , near Hebron in the West Bank . About a year ago , he was heard to prophesy , in a synagogue no less , that " there will come a day when a Jew will get up and kill many Arabs for killing Meir Kahane "  --  the Jewish zealot slain in New York City in 1990 . <P> But this was no simple crazy act . Goldstein was a fanatic who took precise steps carefully calculated to reach a clear , if evil , goal . Presuming the American-born doctor intended to kill the Palestinian-Israeli peace process while avenging what he considered crimes against Jews , he chose time , place and method well to produce the most inflammatory effect possible . What better time than a Friday , the Islamic holy day , during Ramadan , the month of fasting and prayer , the same day as the Jewish feast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister Haman and his followers before they could carry out a planned massacre of Jews ? What better place than the Ibrahim Mosque , where Muslims pray at the Tomb of the Patriarchs  --  a site thought to contain the graves of the prophets Abraham , Isaac and Jacob , guaranteed to draw a wall-to-wall crowd of worshippers ? What better method than to spray clip after clip of bullets into them without warning ? <P> Which Goldstein did , with shocking efficiency . By 5:20 a.m. about 700 men , women and children , having risen in the dark to down a hurried breakfast , had jammed into the mosque for the dawn prayers that mark the start of the sunrise-to-sunset fast on each of the 30 days of Ramadan . Prayers had just begun ; the worshippers were kneeling forward on plastic mats , touching foreheads reverently to the floor . <P> Mohammad Suleiman Abu Sarah , a mosque guard , saw Goldstein , well known to the Muslims as a troublemaker , approach . He was wearing a reserve captain 's olive-green army uniform and a yarmulke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in the occupied territories , he was entitled to carry the weapon wherever he went . Speaking good Arabic , " he asked to go inside during the prayers , " said Abu Sarah . " I said it is forbidden . He said , ' I am the officer in charge here , and I must go in . ' " With that , Goldstein swung his rifle butt into Abu Sarah 's shoulder , knocking him down , and then rushed into the mosque . <P> Inside , Goldstein " did n't say even one word , " reported Abu Sarah . He simply took up a position close to the backs of the worshippers in the rear row and opened fire . " I saw seven people die immediately , " said Abu Sarah . " They were hit in the head , and their brains spilled out . It was total chaos . Everyone was running here and there to try and hide . The mosque was full of blood and wounded people , dead people . " <P> A second guard , too scared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running away . Others who were hit were calling for help . People were swimming in blood . It was difficult to distinguish between the dead and the living , because everyone was covered in blood . " Worshippers raced outside with bodies and jammed them into ambulances without pausing to sort the living from the dead . Ambulance driver Khaled Jaabry discovered only when he reached a local hospital that among the wounded he carried there were his own son and brother .
