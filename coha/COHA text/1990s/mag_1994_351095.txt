THE FIRST DAY OF ELECTION WEEK IN Italy was an inauspicious one for Silvio Berlusconi . The media doge turned politician passed several fitful hours last Sunday watching in dismay as his championship Milan A.C. soccer team suffered a rare upset to archrival Naples . But there was no augury in the loss  --  at least not for the moment . Just seconds after 10 the following night , when two days ' worth of voting was done , Berlusconi stood triumphant on Italy 's center stage ; Forza Italia ( Go Italy ! ) , the party he had conjured from thin air barely three months ago , had emerged as the most important force in the country . In concert with the Northern League and the neo-Fascist National Alliance , the so-called Freedom Alliance had elbowed aside 45 years of corrupt postwar government . Armed with an absolute majority in the lower house of Parliament and close to a majority in the Senate , Berlusconi seemed certain to become the nation 's next Prime Minister . <P> Even before Berlusconi could savor his triumph , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federalists of the Northern League , weary of watching their tax money leave the region , yearn to hive off Italy 's rich north from its impoverished south . But on the opposite flank , followers of the National Alliance prefer a unified Italian state and support the centralist policies of Benito Mussolini . Early Tuesday in Rome 's Piazza del Popolo , a traditional rallying point , hundreds of admirers threw stiff-armed salutes and shouted , " Duce ! "  --  the chant that greeted Mussolini seven decades ago . Three days later , Fini praised the former dictator who allied himself with Hitler as " the greatest statesman of the century . " <P> Thanks to the cross fire of contradictions that divide Berlusconi 's two allies , the country again has the makings of a ruling coalition every bit as fractious as the 52 revolving-door administrations that came before . " It 's a difficult alliance , " Berlusconi concedes . But , adds Il Cavaliere ( " the Knight , " as he is known ) , " a general does n't fight a war with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got . " <P> A self-anointed reformer who promises an end to the kleptocracy that has passed for government in Italy , Berlusconi heads a $7 billion business empire that encompasses the country 's three largest private television networks , its largest department-store chain , and a host of other holdings in publishing , sports , real estate and advertising . He owes much of his dazzling political ascendancy to the fact that he is one of the few top businessmen untainted by Italy 's bribes-for-contracts scandal , which during the past two years has implicated more than 5,000 leading statesmen and businessmen and left a vacuum at the heart of Italian politics . <P> Before Berlusconi 's entry , a left-wing coalition led by the Democratic Party of the Left seemed poised to fill the breach . But the left 's sweeping victory in municipal elections last December galvanized the media magnate to run for office  --  a decision he attributed to " love of my country " and a desire to prevent it from falling under the sway of former communists ( some of whom had pledged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of his revenues ) .
