Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS Beyond the welcoming smiles lies the president-elect 's toughest task : to tame the political culture of Washington before it consumes him <p> If Bill Clinton wants some idea of what he will face next January , let him pause for a moment and imagine that half of all the men , women and children in his hometown of Little Rock , Ark. , were not barbers or waitresses or toddlers but lobbyists . Little Rock  --  total population : 158,000 . Washington , D.C.  --  population of lobbyists : 80,000 . And every last one of them is waiting to chew off a piece of the president . <p> Yes , Democratic insiders were all smoochy in the capital last week , eager to forget that at the same dinner parties six months ago they were n't kissing the Clintons but kissing them off . George and Barbara Bush , displaying a gracious amnesia from the campaign , showed the world how a civilized transfer of power takes place . Even Bob Dole managed to say something nice for a change . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country at large  --  lies the grimmer task of taming the woolly mammoth that is Washington . <p> " The biggest problem is just inertia , " says one Clinton aide , rubbing up against reality . " Washington has atrophied in the last 12 years and does n't remember how to move . Every time you mention a proposal , they say it ca n't get done  --  the lobbyists or the chairman or someone wo n't let it . It 's as if members think they 'd be doing their job wrong if they passed legislation . " While still hopeful about the jobs /health-care / national-service/ deficit-reduction agenda of his boss , he sighs : " The only thing that 's changed about Washington is the president . " <p> Even that is still eight weeks away . In the anxious interregnum before the Jan. 20 Inauguration , Permanent Washington bestirs itself , extending its hand and digging in its heels at the same time . All of the major late-century interests-the medical-industrial complex , the military-job-protection establishment , the corporate gimmes , the ossified liberal ostriches-pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new Democratic president . So does the Hill , not just the leadership , but such Democratic mules as Dan Rostenkowski , John Dingell , Robert Byrd , Lloyd Bentsen . Clinton will work these power centers as assiduously as any president could . Full Schmooze . New Best Friends . The question is whether the grinding gears of interest-group politics will chew up anyone who tries to get under the hood . <p> Let 's face it : no Democrat in a quarter century has managed to bend Washington to his will . The challenge confronting Clinton would leave the last one who did , Lyndon Johnson , scratching his big ears in confusion over where to find the system 's pressure points . Clinton may still believe in a " place called Hope , " but Washington believes more in a complacency called money and status . Why change when everyone in town is doing so well with the system the way it is ? The lava of lawyer-lobbyists , who tell people at parties that they are in " government affairs , " has cooled and solidified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own cozy and rationalizing journalists . <p> Today 's power game is less corrupt but more complex than in the old days . The fat cigar-chomper stuffing cash into a congressman 's pocket has been replaced by a horn-rimmed preppy with a Ph.D . who makes perfectly legal campaign payoffs , spouts plausible-sounding statistics and gins up a million pieces of constituent mail on 48 hours ' notice . As Jeffrey H. Birnbaum explains in a forthcoming book , " The Lobbyists , " the latest rage in lobbying is for " black hat " corporations to associate themselves with " white hat " interests like universities and consumers . That way , the subculture coheres and its inhabitants convince themselves that they are doing the public 's business instead of raiding the Treasury . <p> More immediately , some K Street lobbying firms have become desperate to find out which Democrat is getting which executive-branch job so that they can go out and hire that person 's pals . In other words , if your friend gets a job with Clinton , you get put on retainer at $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay friends . At the higher levels , where the Ron Browns and Anne Wexlers dwell , the lobbyists are close friends and backers of the president-elect himself . <p> Attuned , as always , to the politics of the issue , Clinton is said to be pondering the message conveyed by 19 million Perot voters . No one expects his new ethics rules  --  or even campaign  --  finance reform  --  to transform Sodom into some New Jerusalem . But to accomplish anything , Clinton needs to chart a course through the sludge . Some suggestions from old hands , many of which the Clinton folks have already thought of : <p> Keep campaigning . Political campaigns are about message discipline and coalition-building . So are legislative campaigns . This is why Clinton is likely to combine his communications office with his congressional liaison office into a White House " war room " not unlike the one in the Little Rock campaign headquarters . He 'll go public ( on TV , over the head of Congress ) and private ( cajoling , flattering , haggling ) at once-a pincer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal will be capturing Washington . Victory or defeat will be measured not at the polls ( or in the polls ) but by roll calls . Bus trips will be replaced by " omnibus " trips-huge legislative packages to be voted up or down at once . <p> Make some enemies . They say running against the Washington establishment hurt Jimmy Carter . But every 20th-century Democratic president has tried to stigmatize Washington lobbyists . Woodrow Wilson literally chased them out of town ; FDR called them " pests " ; Harry Truman made a point of saying that he  --  not they  --  represented most Americans . The reason is obvious : identifying powerful enemies puts the president on the side of the people . Clinton shies away from confrontational rhetoric , but he 'll need to use some interest groups as foils or be swamped by the next Perotist wave . Will his " please gene " allow his " change gene " to do so ? <p> Bust some chops . Even Clinton 's own aides admit that he is not comfortable wielding the stick . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only language most legislators understand is strength , not just political but personal . Clinton does n't like to embarrass individuals or interest groups publicly , but even that might be necessary to show that crossing him carries a price . Like the Sister Souljah gambit , a few early signs of toughness can go a long way . <p> Do n't get buffaloed . The worst moment in the transition so far was when Clinton said that Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell convinced him that Congress " took a staff cut " already . Nothing of the kind has taken place . Perhaps Clinton knew that and was making a calculated concession to Mitchell by saying otherwise . If he did n't  --  if he fell for Mitchell 's line  --  he 'd better wise up or he 'll get steamrolled again . <p> Do n't split the difference . Clinton is a dealmaker , and that often means settling for half a loaf . But his biggest coup  --  the selection of Al Gore  --  was based on rejecting old balanced-ticket thinking in favor of intensifying the message . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , he 'll either have to hold fast to almost all of what he wants-or start the process from a bolder base line than he prefers so that the eventual compromise still represents something real . <p> The end is just the beginning . It 's easy to think that signing a bill in the Rose Garden and passing out the pens is the end of the story . For the K Street crowd , it 's just the beginning . That 's when they go to work grabbing control of regulations and enforcement . To prevent bills from being killed after they become law , Clinton will need to sprinkle loyalists throughout the government . Outnumbered on all sides by bureaucrats and lobbyists , they must learn to fight together  --  every day  --  or risk becoming exactly what they have come to town to change . <p> TABLE <p> PHOTOS ( 4 ) : The Clintons got red-carpet treatment last week , at the White House and on the streets of the capital .
