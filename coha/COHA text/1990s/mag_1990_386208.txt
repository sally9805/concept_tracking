<p> ALL OF THE WORLD 'S seaside cities have a special physiognomy . Barcelona , Hong Kong , Lisbon , San Francisco , Cartagena and Rio de Janeiro , among others , offer to those who approach them from the water , a unique and particular perspective with their hills , rivers or bays that mark or reflect the ebb of their naval history , and with buildings and monuments constructed by successive generations . When , as in the case of Venice , there are no natural elevations to bring out the profile of the city , there are lagoons or deltas that create a harbor of beauty and harmony . <p> New York is a more distinctive port city because the borough of Manhattan is considered an island . This isle-city embraced by two rivers that open directly into the Atlantic - the Hudson and its cousin , the East River - has been converted into a vertical mass of steel and cement . In spite of the fact that water is so close , New York is clearly different from other port cities because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not see , hear , or smell the Atlantic . Moreover , its naval history is less note-worthy than its history as a port of entry for an unending flow of immigrants and tourists . <p> When this observer first arrived in New York in 1969 , the city boasted Herculean legs , fabulous torsos and massive shoulders on which rested glorious heads . Among dozens of famous skyscrapers were the Empire State Building , the Chrysler Building and the Woolworth Tower . But New York was missing eyes that would smile out over the sea . It needed an enticing wink - something to seduce travellers and sailors other than the magnetism of the dollar . <p> That was until the late 1980s when Csar Pelli , an Argentine architect , gave New York its sparkling eyes in the form of a beautiful glass plaza called the Winter Garden . This architectural gem , which is part of an extraordinary complex known as the World Financial Center , is located on the edge of Manhattan in Battery Park , just in front of the famous Wall Street district at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October , 1988 , Winter Garden measures an impressive 127 feet in height , 120 feet in width , and 200 feet in length . The garden , full of palm trees and exotic plants , has created an open space protected by a canopy of luminous glass and is , according to the New York Times , " the best achieved public building since the construction of Grand Central Station , the masterpiece of architectural classicism in Manhattan . " Thousands of visitors enter daily by way of the granite stairways that are among the most beautifully designed in any contemporary architectural work . <p> Csar Pelli was born on October 12 , 1926 in San Miguel de Tucumn , Argentina . On his mother 's side , Pelli is descended from various generations of criollos . His paternal grandfather , however , was an Italian immigrant whose love for the marble and other natural resources of his homeland left an indelible mark on the young Pelli . <p> But perhaps the most important factor in Pelli 's artistic formation was the physiognomy of his birthplace . Chiseled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Miguel de Tucumn was constructed in the best Spanish colonial style of the sixteenth century and was destined to be , in the nineteenth century , the cradle of Argentine independence . Despite modern expansion , the city still maintains its colonial atmosphere , with ancestral houses , red-tiled roofs and many open spaces where semi-tropical plants abound . As in other Latin American cities , newer buildings are integrated with traditional hacienda-style houses , all constructed around a main plaza where one can find the Cathedral , the government offices , the theatre and the most important inns ( now hotels ) . <p> Here , in this horizontally conceived city , Pelli studied architecture and obtained his degree from the Universidad National de Tacumn in 1949 . At that time the University and its School of Architecture attracted students from all over Latin America and prestigious professors from Europe who came to share their knowledge with this small , intellectually refined community . Without a doubt , Pelli 's architectural vision was strongly influenced by the abundance of brick and predominance of enclosed gardens in his native Tucumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of a scholarship , Pelli travelled to the United States to study at the University of Illinois , where he obtained his Master 's . For the next ten years , he worked for the team of the famous Finnish architect , Eero Saarinen and was responsible for several major projects , including the terminal for TWA at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and the Morse and Stiles Colleges at Yale University . <p> After serving as the Director of Design at DNJM Studios in Los Angeles for four years , Pelli became an Associate Architect of Gruen Associates in 1968 . For the next eight years , he completed prize-winning designs for , among others , the Municipal Building in San Bernardino , California , and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo , Japan . <p> In 1977 , Pelli was elected Dean of the School of Architecture of Yale University . Once settled on the east coast of the United States , where he had come , in his own words , " to dedicate myself to teaching and survive by remodelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Csar Pelli and Associates . Among the company 's founders were his wife ; the Argentine landscape architect , Diana Balmori ; and Fred Clark , a graduate of the University of Texas . In 1984 , Pelli resigned his well respected post as Dean to dedicate himself fully to his company . <p> The face of New York , perhaps more than that of any other city , has been influenced by the architectural designs of Csar Pelli . Among the works completed there by his company over the last seven years are the renovation of the Museum of Modern Art ( MOMA ) and its adjacent apartment tower on 54th Street ; the World Financial Center in Battery Park in lower Manhattan ( which includes Winter Garden and four skyscrapers with between thirty-four and fifty-one floors occupying six blocks along the Hudson River ) ; and the recently unveiled Carnegie Hall Tower with fifty-nine floors and a total width of only 52 feet . The Carnegie Tower is dressed in bricks of five shades ranging from amber to terra cotta that make it , according to Time magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At present , the studios of Csar Pelli and Associates have a staff of 80 North American , European , Latin American and Japanese architects who work together in flexible multidisciplinary teams . In this way , Pelli , who is ultimately responsible for every work and thus intervenes in the design of every project , is able to handle formidable orders in cities other than his already familiar New York . Among these have been the Norwest Center in Minneapolis with fifty-seven floors ( which will become a " landmark " immediately upon its unveiling ) ; the NCNB Corporate Center in Charlotte , North Carolina , with a sixty-story tower , hotel plazas and covered areas ; the Pacific Design Center I and II in West Hollywood ; the Ley Student Center and Herring Hall at Rice University in Houston , Texas ; the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland , Ohio ; and the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury , Connecticut . <p> Pelli studios will also leave its stamp on London with Canary Wharf , a complex that includes a tower of more than seven hundred seventy-six feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train station , with a capacity of sixty thousand passengers . " In every one of our works we take threads of the past to weave together with contemporary technology and sensibility , and every building should be a legacy to improve the life of the city in which it stands , " reflects this simple master of modern architecture . The modesty of Csar Pelli , however , does not belittle the achievements of his genius . Pelli has reached heights that very few professionals even dream of : he left a tranquil , provincial Argentine city of flowers , birds and patios and was able to conquer and at the same time beautify New York , the most competitive metropolis in the world . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Reminiscent of New York 's Golden Architectural Age , copper-topped skyscrapers rise majestically in the World Financial Center <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Csar Pelli and Associates ' multiple projects express the firm 's creative versatility clockwise from top left : The 1984 renovation of New York 's Museum of Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Financial Center 's ( WFC ) 3.5 acre riverside plaza ; a hexagonal model of a lifeguard station with operable petal-like shades ; interior of WFC 's Winter Garden , an enclosed skylit courtyard where exotic trees mimic Pelli 's carefully defined lines <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Top Row : New facades were designed to blend harmoniously with the old in the Mattatuck Museum , a renovated Masonic Temple in Waterbury , CT ( left ) and the Jesse H.
