" 98 Moreover , by the late 183os and early r84os , as Thomsonianism was beginning to fade , the regulars were revising their ideas about what constituted " useful " medical knowledge suitable for popular consumption . Their goal remained that of diffusing information , " the great lever , which moves the machinery of the world . " " Greater and greater numbers of orthodox physicians , however , questioned the wisdom of publishing domestic guides that focused primarily on disease management . Thomsonians had revealed and exploited inherent imprecisions in prevailing ideas about the proper political and social order . Learned physicians shuddered at Thomson 's zest for every citizen 's being his or her own physician . Such leveling of distinctions , they were convinced , represented not consummate republicanism but rampant , dangerous democratic excess . Orthodox physicians continued to write and to endorse popular health publications , including domestic guides . The emphasis , however , gradually shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on new importance , as the next chapter explains , in the face of the bankruptcy of institutional , organizational , and legislative responses to sectarianism in the middle third of the nineteenth century . Toward a Literature of Prevention The number of state and local medical societies grew steadily from the 178os through the Civil War . They appeared before 1800 in most former colonies and after the turn of the century spread to the Midwest and through , the South . Medical societies promoted scientific activities and regulated members ' conduct by establishing fee bills and codes of ethics . Their major concern during the mid-nineteenth century , however , was licensing , which was intended to accredit qualified practitioners and to exclude those deemed illegitimate . By 183o thirteen of the twenty-four states had passed licensing legislation . Though the statutes varied slightly from state to state , unlicensed practitioners in all states could be fined and jailed , and they were not allowed to sue for nonpayment of fees . Licensing laws appeared at a time when champions of democracy viewed regulatory efforts as monopolistic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws were notoriously ineffective and virtually unenforceable . Thus a little more than a decade later , nearly every state had repealed its penalties on unlicensed practitioners . Alabama and Ohio were first in 1833 , followed by Mississippi in 1834 , Georgia and Massachusetts in 1835 , Maine in 1837 , South Carolina in 1838 , Maryland and Vermont in 1839 , Connecticut in 1843 , and New York in 1844 . Licensing laws remained in effect until 1852 ill Louisiana , and they were never repealed in New Jersey . ' As the licensing authority of state medical societies was revoked or eroded , orthodox physicians moved defensively to distinguish themselves from unqualified healers . It was a daunting task , complicated by the egalitarian temper of the times and by significant professional discord . Institutional and organizational responses to this situation ? the I01 // creation of voluntary medical associations and the mid-century formation of the American Medical Association ? have been well chronicled by historians of medicine . Another equally important reaction , however , has been neglected : the campaign to educate Americans about health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors were exhibiting growing ambivalence about their customary vehicles of instruction , the domestic health guides . Their dissatisfaction arose in part from the manuals ' emphasis on treatment , which these physicians thought encouraged nonprofessionals to be too involved in trying to cure diseases . They also felt that household guides did not offer adequate guidelines about how to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate practitioners . One response to orthodox criticisms was to modify the guides so that they underscored lay responsibility for prevention and discouraged lay participation in treatment . Increasingly , however , established doctors promoted different forms of popular instruction , particularly lectures , guides to healthy living , and school texts . Whatever the vehicle , the publicists had two central messages . First , disease could be prevented , and it was each individual 's duty to understand this concept and to live according to the laws of physiology and hygiene . Second , if disease did strike , nonprofessionals should defer to orthodox physicians for proper diagnosis and treatment ; only in emergencies should lay people act more independently . ' - Mid-nineteenth-century popular medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay people with professional support . From the physicians ' perspective , this was a precarious alliance . They were constantly on guard to discredit popularizers of Thomson 's ilk , who they felt did not observe the fine line between instructing the population about health and invading the physician 's realm . Not all transgressors were lay people ; orthodox doctors also criticized their own brethren , most notably some authors of domestic manuals , for assigning too much responsibility to nonprofessionals in medical matters . Imbued with the perfectionistic impulse characteristic of many antebellum Americans , popular health writers were seeking to achieve societal well-being through appeals to individual conscience rather than by calls to political action . Orthodox practitioners applauded efforts to instill preventive concepts but were critical of those who failed to bar nonprofessionals from all but the most rudimentary of medical duties . The Battle Against Quackery Without a doubt , quackery was the enemy , but what did this mean ? Regulars tended to label all practitioners except themselves quacks , a defini-103 Figure // tion that implied the existence of meaningful and obvious distinctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less clear-cut . Regulars were right in charging that many sectarian and lay healers were only marginally qualified to practice medicine , but the point is misleading in the absence of two other facts : first , many sectarian and lay healers had received preparation equal or superior to that of many regulars ; and second , many regulars were no better qualified than the " quacks " they denounced.3 Orthodox physicians , then , faced an embarrassing and vexing dilemma that was to endure throughout the century . Many recognized that any successful ? or even credible ? effort to exclude quacks from medical practice would have to go hand in hand with internal reforms . As historians have documented , low entrance and matriculation standards at American medical schools meant that even the students who received diplomas were not necessarily qualified to practice . Many were illiterate , ill-mannered , and unethical . Harvard University President Charles Eliot 's remark in the 187os could have described graduates in earlier decades : " An American physician may be , and often is , a coarse and uncultivated person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unable to either speak or write his mother tongue with accuracy . " a Among the professions , many viewed medicine as the one of last resort . Grumbled one doctor , " It is very well understood among college boys that after a man has failed in scholarship , failed in writing , failed in speaking , failed in every purpose for which he entered college ; after he has dropped down from class to class ; after he has been kicked out of college , there is one unfailing city of refuge ? the profession of medicine . " s Steven Smith , a medical student in the late 184os and then a prominent physician , more succinctly summarized mid-nineteenthcentury public opinion : " A boy who proved to be unfit for anything else must become a Doctor . " 6 Given the abysmal state of regular medical education and practice , some observers predicted that orthodox physicians would not emerge victorious over quackery . The challenge was heightened , they said , by the fact that people had always been credulous and always would be ; thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it would " continue to exist as long as human beings are found upon the earth . " 7 Others , like Yale medical professor Worthington Hooker , were more sanguine . He agreed that quackery existed in " endless " forms and " in all ages and in all countries , . . . among the savage or the civilized , the rude or the refined , the illiterate or the learned . " But Hooker had tremendous faith in the power of knowledge , and he devoted much of his life to popular medical education . Two of his lifelong objectives were internsToward // lated , and both were evident in his 1849 Physician and Patient . The first was to teach people , about the " fantastic and ever-changing " ways in which quackery manifested itself . The second goal was to spell out what capabilities physicians had and upon what resources they could draw Unfortunately , wrote Hooker , part of this educational effort had to be spent on " exposing many of the tricks and manoeuvres " used by a certain class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of a profession , study the science of patient-getting to the neglect of the science of patient-curing . " This could be in large part remedied if " the rules of an honorable professional intercourse " were to " come to be properly understood and appreciated by the public . " Hooker hoped that spreading knowledge about the differences between illegitimate and legitimate practice would create informed judgment and more realistic expectations among his readers.8 Most orthodox physicians were , like Hooker , cautiously hopeful . If people . could be shown the error of their ways , they would improve . Since " an intelligent community " would not support illegitimate practice , then the key to destroying quackery must be popular medical education.9 Georgia doctors had incorporated such beliefs in their 1828 code of ethics , because they felt that popular ignorance about medical matters presented " strong inducements to empirics and illegitimate pretenders , to impose on their credulity . " As a result many citizens " employed the illiterate braggadocio in preference to the regular physician . " The only way to improve the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outline of the medical sciences . . . part of an academic education. " 10 Roughly a decade later , the New Haven County Medical Society found itself in partial accord with its southern colleagues . The New Haven report , printed in an 1837 issue of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal , tied the success of quackery directly to " the general want of information regarding the nature of disease , the operation of remedies , and the powers of the human system . " They thought the situation was exacerbated by the persisting belief that medicine was an occult science , that medical skill was an inherent talent rather than an acquired expertise . Though they acknowledged educational inadequacies , their solution rested on legislation : " it is the right and duty of government to protect the people in every possible way against any trade , or craft , or profession , in which the public has peculiar interest , and the temptations to defraud and deceive are great . " ' But they were increasingly in the minority on this point , deserted by colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ io6 Toward a Literature of Prevention quackery by legal means alone . One was Lunsford P Yandell , professor of chemistry and pharmacy in the Louisville Medical Institute . In addressing the twelfth annual meeting of the Medical Society of Tennessee in 1841 , Yandell maintained that the social context had to be the major factor in deciding what actions to take against quackery . In mid-nineteenth-century America , he argued , this meant that the law could not be relied upon to check or uproot quackery . Even if restrictive laws were passed , Yandell pointed out that they " would be enforced only when they were in accordance with public sentiment . Opposed to it , or in advance of it , they would be a dead letter . " Instead of relying on the law , Yandell advocated improving medical practice . Quackery would flourish , explained the professor , " so long as our systems of cure remain discordant and our remedies uncertain , so long as there continue to be maladies that defy the resources of enlightened art . " To him the path was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task he proposed " was above all human power ? that there must remain , to the end of time , imperfections in the healing art ? diseases which no remedies can reach . " Yandell was more optimistic , confident that the medical profession would improve medical practice , thereby guaranteeing the eventual demise of quackery. ' ' - The members of New York 's Medical Society of Albany County also wrestled with this subject , and their unanimously adopted report of 1844 brought historical perspective to bear on the rationale for using legislation as a tool . ' 3 In the past , they recognized , lawmakers had always believed that restrictive laws were appropriate and necessary to guarantee medical competency and to protect the public from " the ignorant and unprincipled . " To meet this legislative end , legislators and county medical societies had worked together to set standards , organize qualified practitioners , and exercise general supervisory authority over the practice of medicine . The purpose of these actions had been to protect the public from quacks and to promote prudent individual behavior . Yet many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gross imprudence , " protected by law " against imposition , but not against a foolish choice . " Dismayed by " this sad spectacle of human credulity and folly , " legislators had tried to bar all but regulars from practice by enacting prohibitory laws . Prohibitory laws assumed " that it would be ... absurd to have recourse for medical aid to an ignorant person , when it is possible to procure the services of an educated physician . " Those who would " abandon a medical attendant of tried skill and character , for any juggling mountebank . . . must he treated as incompetent to manage their own // concerns . " Unlike restrictive laws , which were intended to encourage individuals to act sensibly , prohibitory laws aimed to compel them to do so . But enactment did not guarantee compliance , and enforcement was virtually impossible . Moreover , restrictive laws often helped irregular practitioners , who were quick to accuse the regulars of " persecution " and " greedy monopoly . " The fundamental dilemma lay in adjudicating between professional responsibility and individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restraining choice . No matter how " absurd the opinions and conduct " of people who consulted quacks appeared to be to orthodox physicians , that did not give the regulars sufficient reason or authority " to impose on them our ideas of wisdom . " The most legislation could hope to achieve " was to give to all the means of knowing the character of those to whom they may apply , and thus enable them to act with a full knowledge of the circumstances , and leave the rest to each man 's own wisdom and prudence . " Restrictive legislation thus seemed inadvisable , and they advocated instead " enlightening the public as to quackery 's dangers . " The burden would then be on the regulars as they tried to promote " the dignity and respectability of our profession ... by an increase of individual zeal and a more cordial co-operation . " In other words , orthodox practitioners should improve themselves rather than try directly to annihilate quacks ; demonstration of obvious superiority would win popular support . " How , then , were people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential practitioner and a president of the New York state medical society , had thought it would be largely self-evident . As he said in 181o , " When Practitioners of Medicine are diligent and judicious in the exercise of their profession , they manifest to men of any discernment , their superior skill and success in the cure of diseases ; and will show in a striking point of view , the difference between the well educated Physician and Surgeon , and the mere pretender to professional knowledge . " 15 But as orthodox physicians answered this question in the middle decades of the century , they unwittingly revealed that the differences between legitimate and illegitimate healers were far from clear . A London Lancet excerpt that appeared in the 1841 Boston Medical and Surgical Journal stressed the importance of punctuality , " a ternary composed of conscientiousness , benevolence and firmness . " Everyone , said the article , " can judge of punctuality , but all can not judge of medical knowledge ; their judgment will , therefore , be decided by that which they can appreciate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious criterion by which to identify a good doctor , but it would not have i08 Toward a Literature of Prevention seemed unusual to a mid-nineteenth-century citizen . Nor would urbanity , which Stephen J. W. Tabor emphasized in an 1844 letter to the same journal . " The physician , " wrote Tabor , " should not only be acquainted with the diversified and protean forms of disease , and with all that relates to his own peculiar art , but he should also be versed in what appertains to courtesy and to good manners . " 17 Credentials based on character and conduct were equally or more important in this period than formal medical training.l8 Silas Holmes advised Americans to use analogical reasoning to evaluate practitioners , for " a medical man well informed on other subjects , and capable of reasoning correctly on them " was apt also to be " well informed on medicine . " Recognizing the imperfections of medical practitioners , Holmes had two suggestions for " elevating " the medical profession and broadening public support : to make certain that doctors and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be to make every person his or her own doctor , but would be to familiarize people with the structure of their bodies , various diseases to which they were subject , and treatments for those diseases . Holmes thought that this information should be disseminated by orthodox physicians themselves , using the press and courses in anatomy and physiology . 19 Charles B. Coventry , professor of obstetrics and medical jurisprudence at Geneva Medical College , made similar suggestions . As he said in his 1842 valedictory address , it was obvious to doctors that " no nian is born a physician , but to acquire this knowledge is the labour of years of unremitting toil . " But the public did not understand this , and it was essential to educate Americans , both about practitioners and about their bodies . Once people had been taught how their bodies worked , perhaps they would hesitate to trust " persons entirely ignorant of its several parts , when a single error may cost them their lives . " There would be other benefits of " the general diffusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against quackery and empiricism out of the profession , " but " it would qualify the community to judge as to the actual and comparative merits of members of the profession . " Thus he urged graduates to seize " every opportunity of giving popular lectures on anatomy , physiology and hygiene . " 20 Alabama physician John S. Wilson argued from the same perspective.21 Improving medical education was crucial , maintained the doctor , as was educating citizens " through the popular channels of intelligence . " Wilson worried that orthodox physicians were not tackling their educational campaign in the right way . Though all the medical journals conToward // tained articles on the evils of quackery , he questioned how great an impact these pieces had on popular practices . Wrote Wilson , " These disclosures never reach the people , and so far as their influence on them is concerned , they had as well be published in Hebrew , as in a medical journal . " He suggested using newspapers and " that happy device of Quackery ? a Medical Almanac . ' " Reevaluating Domestic Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his primary target audience.22 But Wilson was mistaken about the paucity of popular health materials ; indeed , during this period there was an unprecedented proliferation . Medical sectarians generated health tracts and sponsored lectures and periodicals . Orthodox physicians did the same , seeking to defend themselves , to eradicate quackery , and to influence domestic practices . Reform-minded lay people also contributed advice in the form of newspaper and magazine articles , lectures , and books . Household health guides , anchored still by William Buchan 's Domestic Medicine , continued to be a popular vehicle for disseminating medical information . Yet orthodox physicians were becoming increasingly doubtful of the domestic handbook 's utility , as their receptivity to different versions of Buchan 's manual demonstrated . The thrust and character of Buchan 's original text survived to an amazing degree , despite the periodic revisions made after the author 's i 8os death , by his son , A. P. Buchan , member of the Royal College of Physicians of London . What changed was orthodox reaction , as was mirrored in a newly defensive posture evident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " a certain low class of selfappointed practitioners , who call themselves of the faculty " ; these people had charged that his work " served only to encourage the fatal practice of domestic quackery . " This was a complete misrepresentation , complained Buchan , since " the obvious tendency " of his work was to educate people about their health " and thus to guard them against the bad effects of ignorance and rashness on their own part , and of impudence and deceit on the part of others . " Moreover , he had aimed to reduce popular reliance on medicine , a goal championed by other orthodox practitioners . As for actual cases of illness , his book posed no threat to the medical establishment , for he had advised " that those who are ignorant of physic . . . confine themselves to regimen alone , and leave the medical treatment of their complaints to persons of better information . " 24 As 13uchau intimated , the social climate had changed and regular docIto Toward a Literature of Prevention tors no longer saw domestic health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family physicians " continued to appear , orthodox support for them began to wane . Criticism was isolated and sporadic in the I82os , but an important early foe was the New-England Journal of Medicine , precursor of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal . One of its reviewers , discussing elite physician Usher Parsons 's 182o Sailors ' Physician , spelled out criteria of acceptability that were to become increasingly prevalent.25 The reviewer commended Parsons 's work , for it " stood on totally different ground " from most popular health guides , which " were in spirit and in effect pieces of quackery , calculated to diffuse among those who are in the habit of consulting them , a mass of ill-defined , half-comprehended , narrow ideas and prejudices , excessively embarrassing to the regular practitioner in his intercourse with them . " Readers , the critic hastened to add , should not construe these comments as signs of opposition " to the universal diffusion of medical knowledge , " because " nothing could be more conducive to the best interests of the profession . " However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge ? a knowledge of the general and fundamental principles of the science and not of its technological details with respect to particular diseases . " Previously published health manuals did not meet this standard . " Few things have contributed so much to the making of habitual invalids , " summarized the critic , " as Buchan 's Domestic Medicine and other works of the same notorious character . " Parsons 's guide , on the other hand , provided the right kind of information for public consumption , because it aimed to help only those people who otherwise would not be able to obtain professional advice . Aware that this meant that the physician 's role would inevitably be usurped by a lay person using an advice book , the reviewer did not find this troubling . Parsons 's guide would be used , the critic thought , only in situations where the choice was between the Sailors ' Physician and no orthodox advice at all . For this reason the reviewer warned that it would be dangerous to wait until " a case of disease occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was found corresponding to the symptoms ... observed . " Instead , mariners should familiarize themselves with the volume , so that they would be prepared to act quickly and sensibly in the rush of emergencies . The writer was confident that any " judicious and intelligent master of a vessel , who should carefully and attentively study a book of this kind , would , no doubt , especially in the milder cases of disease , be able to render essential service to his crew . " Parsons 's work , concluded the reviewer , was excellent , for it was " brief and perspicuous , " well suited for its intended readership because it " does not run out into Toward a Literature of Prevention iii those details , nor include those varieties which could only be embarrassing to individuals who are deficient in a medical education . " Though it is difficult to understand why Parsons 's guide met the standards of medical propriety when similar volumes did not , subsequent reviews in the same journal help clarify the professional attitude to household health guides . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Way to Preserve Good Health , drawn from the London Medical Repository . Despite his professional stature , Thomas met with contempt , accused with having oversimplified his subject . ' ' The following year Thomas 's A Treatise on Domestic Medicine , as revised in 1822 by prominent New York physician David Hosack , elicited a scathing review , this time coupled with a denunciation of the genre. - ? The reviewer charged Thomas with misjudgment in having made minute symptomatic differentiations in a work for the nonprofessional reader . As he queried , " Do not physicians themselves find that it is impossible to draw those accurate lines of distinction in real life , which are laid down so clearly in systematic works ? " Though he agreed that it was a good idea to educate people about medical topics , the reviewer argued that " treatises on Domestic Medicine are not the engines by which this is to be effected . " Why ? The answer was obvious to this writer : " They disseminate the wrong kind of information . " Domestic manuals , wrote the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about disease symptoms and treatment , but this information was worthless : they " teach none of the great principles on which the phenomena of both health and disease proceed , without which these details are not better than the jargon of an unknown tongue . " These books created far-reaching problems for regular practitioners because they " communicated a quantity of crude half digested ideas upon medical subjects , to many individuals , who immediately fancy themselves qualified to judge and criticise the opinions and conduct of their medical advisers . " Assertive patients were often trying , complained the reviewer , largely because " they conceive themselves as authorized to require a reason and an explanation for whatever is going forward . " This left the practitioner in an untenable position : " What is more embarrassing than to be expected to make a case clear to one who is not capable , from want of knowledge , of comprehending it ? What more vexatious than to be required to do this , when you are in doubt yourself ? where every medical man would be so too ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forfeit at once the confidence and good will of your patient or his friends ? " Many patients were not only assertive , the reviewer continued , but // were also arrogant enough to diagnose and prescribe for themselves and others . The meddling spirit inculcated by reading household health guides was extremely dangerous in the absence of a medical education . Because of " the interferences of this race of knowing ones , " doctors often were not summoned until disease had " advanced too far to be checked by remedies . " Though this was only one of the countless negative results of lay presumptuousness in medicine , the reviewer thought that its importance should not be underestimated . " There is no such thing , " he stated flatly , " as getting over the evil consequences produced by a delay in the application of the proper treatment . " More than two decades later , orthodox practitioners were waging the same battle . Physician Walter Channing blamed " the popular literature of the profession " for diminishing " the ancient reverence in which medicine was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisprudence objected to " works on the diseases of children , of females , of mothers , on the management of consumption , syphilis , etc . They are written by physicians , have glossaries for explaining medical terms , descriptions or definitions of diseases , with recipes in English to suit . " Such works " are designed to show what should be done in slight diseases , or in the beginnings of the graver . " Though marketed for the profession as well as for the public , this was a charade . For the nonprofessional , said Channing , " they must be worse than useless , seeing that the public in this regard , and for such purpose , is not educated at all . " Their designated audiences , in fact , were " mothers , and nursery maids , since the man of the house has nothing to do with this domestic literature . " The core of Channing 's opposition lay in the fact that " these popular works suppose that the persons referred to understand the distinction between diseases , the diagnosis ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the treatment . " This was " absurd and injurious , " even with the caveat to send for the physician if the case grew worse . How , asked Channing , could anyone believe that nonprofessionals could be appropriately discriminating ? Moreover , awareness of the situation did not necessarily ensure timely or proper action ; too often people did not " send for the physician till his office is useless , or . . . the case . . . so complicated by what has been done , that it is by no means easy to say what may be safely done next . " Even when summoned , the doctor faced an aggravating situation : " What can be more annoying than to be met at the chamber door of a patient by a friend , a female friend , with book in hand , welcoming us by reading the history of the disease , and then telling us of remedies and results , adding that calomel and bleeding were now necessary , but she really was unwilling to meddle with mineral poisons , or // with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians should simply refuse to consult with such domestic practitioners . Channing thought it would be impossible to " exaggerate the trouble or the harm produced " by domestic health manuals . " The effort has of late been to make medicine popular , " Channing grumbled , " to unfold its mysteries , and unconsciously to make every man , woman , and child , too , his , her , or its own doctor . " Rather than spreading useful knowledge , the books added " injurious activity to ignorance . " Channing went so far as to say that the books by orthodox physicians caused more damage in this purportedly educational effort than the ones written by quacks . For evidence , maintained the doctor , " look at the popular education . The schools are filled with books on anatomy , physiology , hygiene , physical education , chemistry , botany , and what not . " In addition , there were " popular lecturers , men and women , who give regular courses on anatomy , and physiology , and means of preserving health . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there had been Willich and Buchan , Channing remembered , " but they were not then parlor books . " Medical colleges had offered anatomical lectures , " but we did not make anatomy a tea-table topic . " Half a century before , wearing " a false tooth was made a question of morality , since it was considered a mode of obtaining goods under false pretences . And dyspepsia was eschewed from the common talk , as it involved particulars which might not be discussed to ears polite . " The contrast with contemporary behavior was nearly mind-boggling . " Now teeth are talked about , as is the weather . Dentists have their friends , almost their parties . Men have bowels , loose , or costive , and women have spines of the back . " Angrily he asked , " Is it to be wondered at that medicine should have lost something of its earlier veneration , now that it is taught in the nursery , and lies so naked upon the very surface of society ? " Many doctors shared some of Channing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , a large number continued to applaud general guides for nonprofessional use . When Reynell Coates 's Popular Medicine appeared in 1838 , a reviewer feared its title destined to draw suspicion from a medical profession " who have had just occasion to be disgusted with treatises on domestic medicine , medical advisers , etc . " Billed as a " family adviser , " Popular Medicine boasted " outlines of anatomy , physiology , and hygiene , with such hints on the practice of physic , surgery , and the diseases of women and children , as may prove useful in families when regular physicians can not be procured . " More particularly , Coates designed his hook as " a companion and guide for intelligent prinI14 Toward a Literature of Prevention cipals of manufactories , plantations , and boarding-schools , heads of families , masters of vessels , missionaries , or travellers . " Regardless of its wide scope , said the reviewer , the volume contained " a large fund of anatomical , physiological and practical truth . " Orthodox physicians should also praise the Coates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong holds of quackery and empiricism , in their thousand Protean forms . " 29 Coates , one of the founders of the Medical College of Philadelphia , spent much of his life writing and speaking on health and medical issues . Among his books was one of the earliest popular physiology textbooks ; perhaps this is the reason that he devoted the first third of Popular Medicine to an overview of anatomy , physiology , and hygiene . Only then did he discuss disease treatment , starting with first-aid for accidents and other emergencies . Coates frequently distinguished between the action appropriate for a domestic as opposed to a professional practitioner . Unlike some authors of family health guides , he wrote , he did not want his readers to believe that " by a few hours ' study , and an occasional reference to a book , they could supersede the necessity of advice from those whose lives and observations are devoted exclusively to the study of disease . " Thus , after giving explicit directions for manual treatment of prolapsed anus , Coates halted , having reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to a well-informed domestic practitioner . Likewise , relief or cure of more severe cases might call for surgery , " but these require high skill , and the very description of them would be unintelligible to most of our readers . " Curvature of the spine , on the other hand , needed to have a superior surgeon from the outset , and " madness only could induce the tampering of unprofessional hands with cases of such a character . " His instructions about fractures were " merely temporary , .. . designed to procure the patient as much freedom from pain , and security from deformity , as can be obtained by simple contrivances every where at hand , and applied by persons without surgical knowledge . " Eye diseases , especially chronic ones , typically " would endure to wait until the best advice can be obtained . " At the same time , he apologized for discussing palsy . " It is a difficult business , requiring no particular promptitude , " he admitted , " and professional advice on the subject may always be obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not amenable to hard-and-fast rules . With inflammation , for instance , Coates wrote , " It becomes more important that even the domestic practitioner should take a broad view of the subject .... His general knowledge and practical good sense must often be permitted to modify even his application of these directions . " Thus after // providing " ample remarks on Inflammation , in general , " Coates then " trusted mainly to the intelligence of the reader , in applying the principles and directions to particular cases . " 30 Despite his concern about limiting domestic involvement in treating diseases , Coates recognized that there were many situations in which the only practical course was to give each citizen the latitude to act according to his or her own judgment . Coates 's book obviously displayed many of the elements common to its predecessors within the genre of household health guides . It was equally compatible , however , with the growing view that the nonprofessional should limit his role in disease treatment to nursing and emergency care . Many popular writers and lecturers were hammering home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people should relinquish responsibility for disease treatment , but they also advocated that nonprofessionals shoulder the burden for health maintenance . Regular doctors welcomed the publicists ' assumption of this role , but monitored them carefully to ensure that they did not overstep their bounds . Yet the line between respectability and fanaticism or quackery was not always clear-cut , as the fortunes of Sylvester Graham and William Andrus Alcott illustrate . It is useful to reconstruct orthodox reactions to these two well-known health reformers , for the reasons for their shifting fortunes illuminate the perceived distinctions between professionals and nonprofessionals . Clarifying Professional Standards : The Case of Sylvester Graham Sylvester Graham 's crusade has traditionally been introduced as one of history 's colorful sideshow attractions . Until recently , historians largely ignored Graham 's moments at center stage , except to offer amused tributes to the fanatic whose name now adorns the graham cracker.31 The first serious effort to reassess Graham came in the 1930s when Richard Shryock assigned him a leading role in nineteenth-century popular health reform.32 In the past ten years Stephen Nissenbaum and James Whorton have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crackpot vegetarian has been largely supplanted by his status as a pioneer in a continuing health reform movement.33 Born in Connecticut in 1792 , Graham was the last of seventeen children and the son and grandson of ministers . He was two when his father died , and his mother 's inability to care for the children sentenced young Sylvester to a nomadic childhood with different families . By his late teens he suffered periodic bouts of physical illness , emotional exhaustion , // and depression . The early 182os brought increasing involvement in temperance work , which Graham soon combined with ministerial training . In 1826 the young man received his license to preach , soon thereafter becoming an ordained evangelist and a traveling agent for the Pennsylvania Temperance Society . A captivating speaker , Graham , reported a newspaper in 1830 , had " astonished and delighted the numerous and crowded audiences which have heard his lectures . Judges , Lawyers , Physicians , and Clergymen as well as the more unlearned , all degrees of society have listened to him , with equal interest and satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the addictive properties of alcohol or even on " intemperance " generally . He was most interested in the impact of alcohol on normal physiological processes . Alcohol , he said , was an irritant that overstimulated the body , leading to moral as well as physiological injury . Though Graham insisted that he drew these ideas entirely from his own physiological observations , a more accurate lineage would trace them to French physiological theory ? particularly Xavier Bichat 's vitalism and Francois Broussais 's theory of pathology ? together with Benjamin Rush 's linkage of " artificial " stimulation with debility . Graham retained this framework as he expanded his horizons beyond the physiology of drinking . By 1831 he billed himself as a lecturer on a far more inclusive subject , " The Science of Human Life , " and soon he had added to his repertoire the cholera epidemic , sexual chastity , vegetable diet , and the virtues of bran bread . For the rest of the decade he spoke on these subjects throughout the Atlantic states , New England , and upstate New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread-making appeared in print between 1832 and 1837 , each going through a number of editions . In 1839 he published his major work , Lectures on the Science of Human Life , in two volumes totaling more than twelve hundred pages.35 By this time , however , Graham had become a controversial figure , so much so that in the mid-1830s he was attacked by mobs on at least three occasions . Nissenbaum has attributed this to the growing celebrity of his ideas and to his contentious and abrasive personality . Nissenbaum speculates in passing that another factor may have been his dismissal as a charlatan by several respectable medical publications , most notably the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal . This point deserves further attention , for it is seldom remembered that the medical establishment welcomed Sylvester Graham when he first appeared on the health reform scene in the early 183os . Indeed , he seemed the embodiment of hopes expressed by an 1831 reviewer of a couple of Harpers ' health publications , who had queried : " Why , among the thousand forms in which the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings , health , do we not find popular lectures given on dietetics , and the means of avoiding disease ? " 36 The initial reaction to Graham in the pages of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal augured well . In 1835 one of its correspondents registered amazement at the ridicule that learned doctors had heaped on the young man . Having heard the health reformer lecture on " The Science of Life , " the listener could detect no heresy in Graham 's teachings . Graham , he said , had " presented nothing extravagant ? nothing that was not positively correct in relation to life , health and disease . " In fact , continued the correspondent , rather than " being the originator of a new system , totally opposed to those facts in the science of life , already extensively promulgated and practised upon by all well educated physicians , he simply exhibited himself to be a fearless , independent , benevolent expounder of this difficult science , which he seems to be endeavoring to make plain to the comprehension of all classes of intelligent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subjected seemed unwarranted , for his propositions were " based upon known physiological laws . " Moreover , continued the writer , " his language and his illustrations were in strict accordance . . . with the best medical authors . " Were Graham to follow the course set out in his introductory lecture , " the medical profession , above all others , will be benefited and dignified by it , and the world at large must ultimately be bettered by the influence of the knowledge he is disseminating . " Despite its favorable tone , the notice ended by reserving judgment on whether Graham was destined to " sink himself in the mazes of designing quackery " or whether he could continue to rely on this prestigious volume for Lupport.37 Subscribers could judge for themselves , since the volume also contained extracts from Graham 's lectures on " the science of human life " and " the vitality of the blood . " 3s The sentiments Graham expressed in the excerpts from The Science of Human Life would have been congenial to most orthodox readers.39 People , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed laws of life , by the proper observance of which , man can , with any certainty , avoid disease and preserve health , and prolong his bodily existence . " This was entirely wrong , but the view had persisted among Americans because " most or all of their opinions are the results of feeling , or what they miscall experience , rather than of deep reasoning and philosophical investigation . " These beliefs were extremely difficult to eradicate , since " every person knows from his own feelings and experience , precisely what kind of constitution he has ? and what agrees and what disagrees with it . " Graham 's aim , like Benjamin Rush 's half a century earlier , was not " to // convince people that they have no feelings , nor that they do not know when , and how much they feel , " but was instead " to convince them that the kind and degree of their feeling by no means teach them what causes it , nor the principles upon which its existence depends . " Graham illustrated his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cured her headaches with tea , " ' the sovereignest remedy in the world ' for headache . " Because it was a sensible assumption that the lady best knew her own feelings , it seemed a " gross ... insult to her understanding . . . to attempt to convince her that tea is a poison , and that her use of it is a principal cause of her headache . " Indeed , Graham conceded that " she knows best how her own headache feels , and that she knows it is relieved by a cup of tea . " But this constituted only a superficial understanding of the situation , as he stressed with a barrage of questions : But does she know either the remote or immediate cause of her headache ? Does she know the vital properties and powers and functional relations of the organs of her body ; and does she accurately understand the healthy and the diseased affections and sympathies of those organs ? Does she know the qualities of the tea in relation to the vital properties and functional powers of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of the tea on her system ? ? how it produces the pleasurable feelings , and how it removes the pain of her head ? And does she know whether the very effects of the tea , by which the paroxysms of her headache arc relieved , arc not the principal source of her headache , and the main cause of the frequency and violence of the paroxysms ? Graham 's final thrust left no doubt about his position : " If not , what are her feelings and experiences worth , to herself or others , as rules of life , by which she or any one can judge of the fitness of her habits to the laws of life and health ? " He had his answer ready : " not a farthing ! " Even that was a swollen valuation , for " they are worse than nothing ? mere delusions by which we are decoyed from step to step along the specious labyrinths of sensuality and suffering . " People could not use feelings as a reliable indicator of anything unless they understood " physiologically how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feelings to the powers and laws of vitality , and to the condition and functions of the living organs . " These were not provocative statements . In fact , they reinforced orthodox teaching about the inadequacy of individual experience alone as a healing credential . Nonetheless , almost immediately after his debut in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal , Graham found himself embroiled in controversy . The health reformer had only himself to blame for initiating the acerbic bickering , and it resulted in his eventual expulsion from // the periodical 's pages . The sniping started when Graham criticized New Hampshire physician Luther V Bell , winner of the 1835 Boylston Medical Committee 's prize for his essay advocating a mixed diet for New England laborers.4 " Bell 's piece opened with what Graham interpreted as a salvo intended for him : the statement that the essay aimed to counter the " schemes of Pythagorean or Utopian dreamers . " Even though Bell did not specify whom he meant , the phrase clearly did allude to contemporary vegetarians . Human anatomy , Bell wrote in reversal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eating habits ; because human beings possessed the God-given faculty of reason , their natural diet consisted of any food that their reason could adapt to their bodies.41 This was anathema to vegetarians like Graham , who reminded people that reason could be abused . Graham extended this logic to conclude that every human was " naturally a fruit and vegetable eating animal . " As he argued with Bell , Graham took pains to express respect for the medical profession , but he also pointed out some orthodox shortcomings . In doing so he used language that seemed arrogant and ill-mannered , and in turn raised questions about the sincerity of his praise . Graham 's central criticism was that learned doctors , like other humans , tended " to cling to established institutions , and to reverence hereditary usages . " This meant that doctors too often upheld and defended traditional beliefs without questioning their truth . If Bell , for instance , " before writing his prize dissertation , instead of ransacking Cyclopoedias and other volumes of printed matter , had done as I have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honestly sought after the truth rather than to support any theory or hypothesis , he would certainly have been led to a different conclusion . " Here the health reformer begins to delineate a different and less innocuous medical position . By setting up individual experience as the superior path to truth , he is now contesting not only the primacy but the utility of formal education . Graham 's attack , replete with unsubstantiated criticisms , sparked a wave of controversy ; before it ended , journal contributors were debating whether Grahamism caused insanity.42 Bell himself responded first . He began by disclaiming prior knowledge of Graham except as an itinerant lecturer of sorts , adding patronizingly that only Graham 's " inordinate conceit " could have led him to believe that he was the subject of the essay . Sarcasm dripping from every word , Bell thanked " this modest , lucid , and scientific reviewer , for not scalping me nor tomahawking me , as he says he might so easily have done , as well as ... for his magnanimity in not bearing away the prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sided with Bell and characterized Ito Toward a Literature of Prevention Graham 's attack as " mere swaggering , " repeated but unproven declarations of prowess . To Beta , Graham 's boasting of " matchless assurance " of the " ' length and breadth ' " of the field under question was actually only " prodigious effrontery . " Graham had benefited the community by promulgating some sound physiological principles , but his dietary ideas now seemed visionary or harmful . Moreover , Graham had been rude , guilty of comportment not befitting a medical man . " But whatever Mr. G. 's merits may be as a lecturer , or will be as an author , " he concluded , " I am persuaded he is entirely out of his element in a medical Journal . " 44 Subsequent articles underscored the importance of meeting the standard of professional decorum . Correspondent " A " feebly parried Beta 's charges point by point , first conceding displeasure " with the manner in which Mr. Graham defended himself . " What others had taken for Graham 's " brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior for his shyness . Here , in fact , was the source of Graham 's uniqueness : he was " at one and the same time , an original thinker , and a simple , plain , matter-of-fact man . " 45 Even Graham tried to clear himself of the charge that he had been " offensive or disrespectful . " Ostensibly aware that " personal abuse and vituperation " were not considered appropriate weapons , Graham was so busy accusing Bell of poor conduct that he was evidently blind to his own transgressions on that score . Nor did he think he was overreacting by concluding that Bell 's remarks about vegetable diet were aimed at him . The only two other possibilities , he felt , were physician R. D. Mussey , professor of anatomy and surgery at Dartmouth College , and minister Edward H. Hitchcock , professor of chemistry and natural history at Amherst . Not only did Graham think they were less well known , but he was confident that " a young gentleman of good education , and of Dr. Bell 's just claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indecorous and even insolent language towards one of his own profession . " Graham also found it hard to believe that he was " so humble and obscure " that Bell had never heard of him . On the contrary , Graham knew that " his name had been sounded all over the United States , and almost universally with odium and ridicule , as the name of the individual who advocates abstinence from flesh-eating , and a diet of vegetables , bran-bread , etc . " Thus " no man can travel by stage or steamboat , or go into any part of our country . . . and begin to advocate a vegetable diet , or even sit down at a table and abstain from flesh , tea , coffee , etc. without being immediately asked ? and in no flattering manner ? What ! are you a Grahamite ? ' " 4 ( // The health reformer felt victimized by misrepresentation . It was unjust to portray " ' the Graham system ' " as " simply a diet of bran bread and water . " As Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " regular and scientific physician " : " enlightening the people in the knowledge of their own nature , and destroying their confidence in the wholesale mode of patent drugging . . . ; and by endeavoring to draw a broad line of demarcation between the true physician and the quack ? to sustain the former , and . . . to annihilate all quackery . " He thus implored the regulars to " treat me as a man , honest in my errors , . . . and honestly and candidly point out those errors to me . " The prevailing mode of " personal obloquy and ridicule and reviling and slander " would not promote truth , honor orthodox practitioners , or injure Sylvester Graham.47 Graham 's defenders in this forum disappeared as fast as his detractors multiplied . A correspondent identified simply as " W.* W* " agreed with Beta that the tenor of Graham 's remarks resembled the newspaper puffs of quacks promoting their infallible remedies.48 Not resting content with this charge , W.* W.* set out to prove that Graham himself was a quack . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the requirements of popularity . Having thus relinquished any meaningful standard of conduct , it would be foolish to expect professional behavior from him . " Living , as he does , " wrote W* W.* , " by popular declamation , and seeking first applause and money , he must needs sacrifice everything to effect ? he must leave nothing in doubt ? all must be absolute , universal , infallible ? and the darker any point is , the more he must asseverate , dogmatize and denounce . " The vehicle Graham had chosen , contended W* W.* , was " ' blurting ' warfare against the favorite stimulants of mankind . " Yet W.* W* could see no sound scientific proof except " that tea and coffee and flesh are not his favorite stimulants . " W* W.* went even further . " Graham 's pretended science of life , " he charged , " is chiefly the science of his own idiosyncracies . " Different individuals , W.* W* reasoned , had varying capacities for accommodating any given stimulant . " To maintain that the favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and repugnant to the vital sensibilities , is flat nonsense . " Moderation in food and drink was the key , and , since each individual was different , it was up to each person to decide what constituted moderation . The conclusion was obvious . Graham was " a rank empiric " whose remedies were nothing but " nostrums , grand ? absolute ? universal . " But even W.* W.* had to concede that " to do him justice , he is more useful , less dangerous , earns his gains ' more honestly , than most of those pretenders , " and that his remedies were likely to benefit many invalids . // " R " was the next to enter the fray , supporting Graham ; again the central questions concerned standards of conduct and character . Critical of W.* W.* 's " low , scurrilous and dishonest manner , of personal abuse and slander and falsehood , " this correspondent was appalled at W.* W.* 's " cowardly impudence " in anonymously attacking a person whom he had never even heard lecture . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures in Boston , " he maintained , " has been that they are too severely scientific and abstruse . " Even an eminent writer , Dr. John C. Warren , " had declared Mr. G. 's lectures too scientific for a popular audience . " Contrast this , he sputtered , with " your impudent correspondent , in utter ignorance , but with a pretension to knowledge ( which in a moral point of view amounts to downright and wilful falsehood ) , " who " asserts that Mr. G. produces his effect on his ignorant audience by mere declamation and assurance . " R found W* W* guilty " of shameless calumny and barefaced falsehood . " In a community where " sacredness of personal character is the very palladium of social peace and prosperity , " it seemed impossible to think highly " of that individual who thus presumes to assassinate , in public , the character of one of whom he is entirely ignorant ! " 49 But the weight of medical opinion bore inexorably down . M. L. North did adopt a neutral stance , pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . Disinterested observers could then test reliable case histories , complete with names , places , and dates , for authenticity ; on this basis theoretical positions could be verified or found wanting.50 Graham also tried to silence his critics by qualifying some of the sweeping statements attributed to him . " To suppose that any regimen or mode of treatment can save every individual , whatever may be the kind or stage of the disease , is egregiously unreasonable , " granted Graham in one effort.S1 No one listened . Undaunted , W.* W* resumed his crusade . " Grahamism . . . may be defined , " he said , as " the empirical recommendation and use of a vegetable and water diet . " Lest there be a mistake , he further specified that " an empirical recommendation is one that is indiscriminate , incautious , and extravagant , " and would undoubtedly " do much mischief . " Orthodox physicians , of course , recommended vegetable diet in some cases , but they did not , like Graham , " prescribe one eternal Lent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using a common shorthand reference to quackery , vegetable diet " is the ism of Mr. Graham . " 52 By this time , though , there were skirmishes on another front : whether or not Grahamism caused insanity . An anonymous correspondent , later // identified by Graham as Dr. Lee of the Insane Hospital at Charlestown , opened this Pandora 's box by suggesting that some mental illnesses might be traced to the adoption of vegetarianism.53 Graham responded to Lee 's charges at great length , but the Journal 's editors finally closed their pages to the still-raging controversy between Graham and his opponents . Graham was allowed the last word , one final attempt to win favor : " I have nothing to do with medicine ? deal in no secret remedies ? but in all cases where medical treatment is necessary in those who come to me , I send them to the physician . I am a public lecturer on the Science of Human Life . " 54 Graham 's protestations were to no avail , because he had already been irrevocably saddled with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspicious beginning , Graham , hurt by his unmitigated dogmatism , perceived boorishness , and apparent conceit , plummeted from medical legitimacy to crackpot status . One of his contemporaries came close to sharing the same fate . Missionary of Health : William A. Alcott The epithet of " Grahamism " was commonly applied to William Andrus Alcott 's work as well . Though Alcott found the popular association ignominious , there was ample room for confusion . Like Graham , Alcott lectured widely on right living , including the importance of a vegetable diet . Yet Alcott had a broader perspective , and he more successfully elaborated and popularized a complete and balanced hygienic philosophy . Alcott was also a much more prolific author than Graham , and , by the time of his death in 1859 , had to his credit more than a hundred volumes of books and journals on self-improvement . Whether about health , religion , or education , Alcott 's books , like Graham 's , explored different facets of what he saw as a single entity . Alcott 's writing was decidedly more accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar language and examples.55 Born in Connecticut in 1798 , Alcott was descended through both parents from pioneers . In delicate health for most of his growing-up years , he floundered until he opted in 1816 for teaching , his life 's work . By the late 182os he was contributing regularly to educational journals , and soon thereafter he moved to Boston , the scene of tremendous educational ferment . In 1832 his Essay on the Construction of Schoolhouses won a competition sponsored by the American Institute of Instruction . The outlines of Alcott 's philosophy were clear in this piece , which stressed the impact that a school 's structures and furniture had on students ' health and their Picture ability to learn . He buttressed his points with arguments about the economic costs of preventible illness , a note increasingly heard among public health reformers . During this period Alcott also worked with William Channing Woodbridge , editor of the American Annals of Education and the most famous American popularizer of the ideas of Johann Pestalozzi , the early nineteenth-century Swiss educator who advocated making the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the Pestalozzian emphases appealed to Alcott : cultivatToward // ing reasoning powers instead of relying on rote memorization ; managing children with friendly understanding instead of rigid discipline ; and especially developing well-rounded individuals whose physical , moral , and intellectual faculties would operate in harmony with one another . The new educational ideas stressed imparting knowledge about bodily structure and function as an integral part of the quest toward full realization of the human potential . These ideas were to be essential elements in Alcott 's strategy of hygienic reform . That strategy did not evolve solely from his teaching experiences , however . By the mid-i 82os Alcott 's classroom duties had proven onerous enough to precipitate a physical decline he diagnosed as consumption ; he responded by enrolling in Yale to study medicine . He received his degree in 1826 , but Alcott marked the real culmination of his studies as his return to health , which he celebrated with a July fifth " declaration of independence with regard to those earthly props medicines on which I had so long been wont to lean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on his natural and moral enactments . " From this point on , he rejoiced , " I was emancipated from slavery to external forms , especially medicated forms . " Nature , he was convinced , was the only true physician , and human medical art was not only inferior but was usually harmful.56 Despite Alcott 's credentials , when his Vegetable Diet was reviewed in an 1838 issue of the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal , its proper evaluation eluded the writer . As the title trumpeted , the book had been " sanctioned by medical men , " and the reviewer acknowledged that Alcott had presented medical testimonials supporting a vegetable diet and advising against eating meat . Yet , as the reviewer pointed out , medical opinion was far from united on the subject ; in fact , the works Alcott cited in support of a vegetable diet also contained passages recommending meat eating . The reviewer did not press the point , conceding that Alcott 's crusade might be beneficial in a country where too much meat was ordinarily consumed.57 The subject was considered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An anonymous correspondent praised Alcott as the " industrious , " " worthy and intelligent " author of several books , " some ... of considerable merit , designed to improve the health and morals of the community . " Through this commendable work , he continued , Alcott had helped diffuse physiological knowledge , show its educational applications , and combat medical imposture and charlatanism . But on the subject of dietetics , wrote this contributor , " He is evidently beside // himself . As often as he touches it his mind runs riot . " The anatomical argument in which Alcott and Graham invested so much did not convince this writer , who thought it more logical to assume that a person 's reason allowed him or her to adapt many foods for individual use . " Were animal food as poisonous , as noxious to health and life , as the bran-bread gentlemen would persuade us to believe , why was not the universal yankee-nation long ago extinct ? " queried the correspondent . The facts seemed to argue in favor of the opposite conclusion : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more robust bodies , and a little shrewder minds . " How , he wondered , could this be reconciled " with ... practical illustrations of the effects of bran-bread and dried apples , . . . the cases of half a dozen gaunt , wry-faced , lantern-jawed , ghostly-looking invalids , who . . . are so many walking proofs ( those that are able to walk ) ? " 58 More to the point , it was those who were sick , not those who were well , who had to pay special attention to food . For the healthy , he argued , appetite was " a safe and competent guide . " The " hardy yeomanry " were " not the class of those who run after mountebank lecturers on health for advice . " They did not need to listen to " cranium-cracked dyspeptics , or their vaunted system of living . They have within themselves a sure guide . . . which never misleads them or jeopards their safety . " This contributor conceded that some people might thrive on a vegetable diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would be productive of great evil . " Not only were Alcott 's ideas " false " and of " injurious tendency , " but they also " served to agitate , unnecessarily , the public mind . " This was because they turned everyone 's " attention . . . to their health , and they become anxious to know what they shall eat and what they shall drink . " This anxiety often led to a harmful preoccupation , where people became so fixated on themselves that they began to " be over scrupulous and whimsical about their food , and drink , and whatever concerns their bodies . " A sick person should never be encouraged " to think about his own complaints ; and the surest way to make a well man sick is to alarm him about his health , to set him to watching his stomach and quarrelling with his food . " For these reasons the writer had no doubt that most " of the books and periodicals . . . published within the last dozen years on health , . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " having " caused and aggravated , beyond calculation , the class of complaints which they were intended to prevent and remove . " The contributor thought that the authors were generally " misguided men " who lacked sufficient knowledge to offer competent advice . To be sure , some of the writers were " medical men ; but they have // generally been mere M.D. 's ? physicians without practice and without knowledge . " Though he did not place Alcott in the camp of offenders , he obviously found his advice questionable.59 The editors published the health reformer 's response . Like Graham , Alcott protested that he had been misrepresented . He objected to the " perpetual misnomer " of bran-bread advocacy and the fact that the author had unfairly " interlarded " his essay with " old , hackneyed , newspaper epithets . " The remainder of Alcott 's article addressed misquotations and misconstructions ranging from bad grammar to the number of years he had been compiling the book to the inevitable confusion with Grahamism . The defense was far from substantive.60 The following year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Grahamites and Thomsonians , Alcott tried to clarify his mission . He dreamed , he said , of carrying out " the great object of Christianity ? TO MAKE MANKIND BETTER . " Previous " instructors and elevators of mankind , " he believed , had " made a serious mistake , in not endeavoring to elevate , in due proportion , their whole nature . They have hoped to raise man , intellectually and morally , . . . without doing much for him physically . " Furthermore , " the most aimed at has been correction ; few , indeed , have done much in the way of prevention . " 61 As this passage suggests , vegetable diet was less the centerpiece than a cornerstone of Alcott 's philosophy , which melded morality and physiology . Aptly labeled " Christian physiology " by James Whorton , this guiding philosophy made individual perfection an indispensable vehicle for societal redemption . The prolific Alcott exemplified the first generation of health reformers . Like crusaders for other causes , health reformers promulgated advice that was an amalgam of evangelical beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in science was not only compatible with a familiar religious framework , but scientific and religious explanations were in fact mutually enhancing . They asserted that the laws of nature , ordained by God , could be discovered by rational individuals . Once Americans understood these principles and acted accordingly , they would achieve personal and societal perfection . Alcott 's philosophy of living fueled an outpouring of advice books , published and often reissued from the 183os though the 1850s . In these popular works , each directed at a specific audience , Alcott sought to interpret God 's laws by defining people 's duties to themselves , their families , and their communities.62 The medical profession , suspicious of his vegetarian tracts , lauded these books as extremely useful.63 The Young Wife , for instance , went through twenty editions in roughly as many years after it appeared in the mid-183os.C4 In it Alcott expressed // themes on which he was to embroider for the rest of his life . Education ? its meaning , its importance , its duties , and its effects ? served as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on adult education here , reserving children 's education for discussion in The Young Mother . The first task was to define education , which was much more than " mere instruction in knowledge . " Alcott used the term " in its largest sense , as implying and including everything which forms character for this world or the world to come . " This was " the great office of woman , " whose role in " mere instruction " was subordinate to her responsibility for " the formation of character , physical , intellectual , social , moral , and religious ? its formation , both for time and for eternity . " By this definition , virtually every aspect of living fell under the rubric of education ? and therefore within Alcott 's bailiwick.fi5 Nothing was too insignificant to warrant attention , for often neglect in trifling matters courted disaster in larger ones . Tight clothing , for instance , horrified Alcott because " the mischief which ensued " extended beyond the offender " to generations that come after her . " The damage assumed tragic proportions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the progress of the world 's history , she should have thousands of descendants , not one of them , to the remotest periods of time , would be precisely what he might have been , had she conformed more strictly to the natural laws ? the laws of the human constitution . " With stakes of this magnitude , any detail could undermine or facilitate obedience to the laws of right living . Thus character traits were as important as physical vigor or intellectual development , and all were intimately related . As a result , each chapter , whether it treated delicacy or sobriety or some other subject , was a new showcase for healthy living , with behavioral advice interwoven throughout the text . It was for this reason , explained Alcott , " that I so frequently suffer one chapter to run into and trench upon another . Such is the connection which I plainly perceive between health and morals , that I scarcely know how to separate them . " " Health " and " Attending to the Sick " got their own chapters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did not discuss disease treatment ; nor did he even provide detailed information about how to maintain health , arguing that to do so properly would take volumes.66 More importantly , it would be inappropriate . People who learned rules by rote were not as well equipped to apply them in daily living as were those who understood the underlying principles . Alcott therefore argued that wives should be knowledgeable about anatomy , physiology , and chemistry , and as encouragement he recommended specific books . William Paley 's Natural Theology he judged the best starting // point , after which he suggested George Combe 's Constitution of Man , " rejecting , if you choose , the phrenological part . " Next on the list came Sir William Lawrence 's Lectures on Physiology , Zoology , and the Natural History of Man . After this , Andrew Combe 's Principles of Physiology would be appropriate , followed " by some of the more complete and scientific works on physiology . " Only after having built this firm foundation should the young wife study books on health , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony E M. Willich 's Lectures on Diet and Regimen , and Robley Dunglison 's Elements of Hygiene . Not until this point might the young wife " with entire safety , study the nature or cure of disease , either infantile or adult . " But Alcott thought that lay people should limit their study of medicine , because he believed that it was not " a part of human duty , except as a matter of curiosity , and with a view to prevention . " He agreed it might be helpful to " look over such a work as Buchan 's Domestic Medicine , " but " not to render every one his own doctor . ' " 67 How appropriate was this advice for the wife once she became a mother ? At that point more opportunities for ministering to the sick would surely arise . To what extent was treatment her responsibility ? Alcott had answers for these questions as well . In the mid-183os he published The Young Mother ; or Management of Children in Regard to Health.68 The volume met an eager readership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1836 , by July of that year there were three thousand more ready for the bookstores . By 1839 it was in its seventh stereotyped edition , and in 18S5 the twentieth stereotyped edition appeared . Orthodox doctors also warmly welcomed Alcott 's seventy-five-cent book . As the reviewer in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal explained , Alcott had not tried to be original or brilliant . The book 's " excellence , " the critic judged , " consists in its being a safe , intelligible and full directory to young families and nurses . " This would meet a tremendous need , especially since Alcott had gauged his presentation to his audience , " avoiding technicalities , and ... making his work really popular . " 69 Alcott described the ideal nursery , particularly its ventilation , but he devoted most of his energy to discussing the proper physical care of children . He granted that there were prejudices against dwelling on these topics , but they had arisen , he insisted , " not so much because the Scriptures have charged us not to be over anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reputed to be those who paid the least attention to their health . Just the opposite was true , claimed Alcott . The healthiest people were those who carefully observed the laws of health , for they had good " I IA BITS . " // Again he emphasized self-denial and self-government in smaller matters as an aid to physical and moral rectitude in larger things . The use of confectionary was a perfect example . " The GREAT evils of confectionary . . . are of three kinds , " Alcott lectured , " PHYSICAL , MENTAL and MORAL . " Grimly , he predicted that young people who indulged in " confectionary , were on the high road to gluttony , drunkenness , or debauchery ; perhaps to all three . " Wandering from the path of right living seemed particularly grievous to Alcott , who firmly believed that every infant was born healthy , consonant with Divine intentions . " Civilized society has placed the human race in artificial circumstances , " he lamented , and he wanted to guide people back to correct habits and behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard man as susceptible of endless progression . " 70 Much of this responsibility for improvement rested with the mother , the " arbiter of the present and eternal destiny of her child . " But the mother should not act independently . Instead , she should rely on higher authority , specifically the physician , whose instructions she should uphold in every way . At times Alcott elevated fathers to the same level as doctors , relegating " unthinking nurses or mothers " to a more subservient position . In some situations , he explained , " It requires all the resolution which a father , uninterrupted , can summon to his aid , to administer a dose or perform a task , on which he knows the existence of his child may be depending . " If mothers and nurses then bombarded the father with " thoughtless entreaties ... , it makes his condition most distressing . Mothers , in such cases , ought to encourage rather than remonstrate . They who do not , are guilty of cruelty , and ? perhaps ? of infanticide. " 71 As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially favored physician William P. Dewees 's A Treatise on the Physical and Medical Treatment of Children , five editions of which had appeared in nine years . Like other writers on child management , Alcott reinforced his recommendations with copious references to accepted medical authorities ; he depended on older writers such as Buchan , Cadogan , Locke , and Willich , as well as more recent ones such as Buffon , Dunglison , and Beaumont . But there were no prescriptions , a policy in keeping with his stress on prevention over cure . The closest Alcott came to treatment advice was to point out " a few certain signs and symptoms by which parents and nurses may know a child 's health to be declining , even before he appears to be sick . " 72 The mother , like the wife , should educate herself about bodily conditions , but she should refrain from interfering with // treatment , the physician 's prerogative . Preventing illness was her responsibility . For the unmarried or childless woman , Alcott presented similar advice in another comprehensive volume , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on " Female Responsibilities , " Alcott followed a familiar pattern by using successive chapters to discuss desirable traits and interspersing among them capsules on exercise , rest and sleep , health and beauty , neatness and cleanliness , dress and ornament , dosing and drugging , and taking care of the sick . Once again the health reformer advocated studying anatomy , physiology , and hygiene , which he deemed indispensable for any young woman to " do her utmost in the work of self-education . " There had been much progress with both sexes through lectures and books " on the structure , laws and relations of their bodily constitution . " Nonetheless , every young woman should study these subjects for herself , beginning perhaps with two of Catharine Maria Sedgwick 's moralistic tales , The Poor Rich Man and the Rich Poor Man and Means and Ends : or Self-Training . The works of the Combes should come next , followed by other popular physiology and hygiene texts , among them his own elementary primer , The House I Live In . Alcott 's remaining recommendations testify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy of living : John Mason , SelfKnowledge ; James Burgh , Dignity of Human Nature ; Isaac Watts , Improvement of the Mind ; Amelia A. Opie , Detractions and Scandal ; Francis Wayland , Elements of Moral Science ; and Thomas H. Skinner , Religion of the Bible.74 As had his other volumes , Alcott 's Young Woman 's Guide emphasized that breaches in physical conduct were also moral transgressions . To illustrate the connection , Alcott asked whether " there is any moral character in the error , if it be one , of sitting up an hour later than usual , and then making it up by sleeping an hour after the arrival of day-light ; ? whether it is not a matter of propriety , merely , rather than a question of positive right or wrong in the sight of Heaven . " For the answer , he referred readers to his chapter on conscientiousness , where he had stated unequivocally that no action was too insignificant to be exempt from this stringent moral code . Everything , " whatever we do , " was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given this , " where is the line to be drawn between those actions which are too small or too trifling to be worthy of having any right or wrong attached to them , and those which are not ? " 75 In that same chapter , Alcott had maintained that what was most important was " to meet the approbation of an internal monitor . " Diligence // in this matter was crucial , because it seemed obvious " that the individual who habitually disregards the voice speaking within , on a particular subject , would be likely , ere long , to extend the same habit of disregard to something else . " Proper childhood training was essential . Self-approbation was the only invariable yardstick , and those in whom it was inculcated would act for the glory of God , always cognizant that " there is a right and wrong in every thing . " From that stance , it was an easy matter for Alcott to go one step further : " We should remember that it is not only sinful to do wrong , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Individuals then had a duty not only to themselves and to God but also to society to live properly ; conversely , they did not have the right to do otherwise.76 Moral progress and physical improvement were inextricably joined . Indeed , preached Alcott , " Mere physical improvement ? or even physical perfection , were it attainable ? would hardly be worth the pains , if it were anything more than a means to an end . " The most zealous and conscientious student of health could hardly count herself blessed if her knowledge only increased her " efficiency in the service of the world , the flesh and the devil . " When mankind fell with Adam and Eve , the physical fall had been almost as great as the moral one . Logically , then , restoration could come only with " obedience to those laws by the transgression of which it came . " Obedience to God 's laws would benefit absolutely everyone , for " no person , in any employment whatever , is so healthy as to exclude all possibility of further improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become . " 77 The Young House-keeper , which also appeared in the late 183os , conveyed the same message . " Whatever views may be suggested by the title , this book is really and truly a work on Physical Education , " explained Alcott . He compared it with The Young Mother , for it had the same " principal end and aim , the physical improvement of the community . " He sought to transform housekeepers into " thinking beings " rather than " mere pieces of mechanism ; or , what is little better , the mere creatures of habit or slaves of custom . " Though it shared the objectives of The Young Mother , it was " a separate and entirely different volume , " being " almost wholly confined to the nature and preparation of food . " 78 Used in conjunction with one another , Alcott 's books offered virtually all-inclusive guidance for American women . Alcott also wrote advice books for young men . When the second edition of The Young Man 's Guide appeared in 1834 , the notice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general diffusion among the young men of our country , of a work that must conToward // tribute greatly to the preservation of their health , as well as to their general improvement , success , and usefulness . " 79 Since many character traits were desirable to everyone , Alcott covered some of the same material in his guides for men as he did in his books for women . Thus , Familiar Letters to Young Men , the companion piece to The Young Man 's Guide , provided sections on self-respect and self-reverence , self-knowledge , self-dependence , self-education , and the love and spirit of progress . Alcott also warned of the dangers of excitement , and he discussed purity , pleasure-seeking , civic and conjugal duties , and religion . New topics concerned employment , including how to start a business and how to make money . Physiology was important to men as well , and its definition sounded familiar : " all such knowledge as pertains to the physical education and management of human beings . " As Alcott had informed women , he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal . To this end Alcott thought young men should attend lectures , either those illustrated by manikins or those that covered the laws of health more generally . Of the former types , he recommended the ones given by Weiting , Darling , Cutter , and Wright . He thought that the best of the general lectures were conducted by Mussey , the Fowlers , Gove , and Alcott himself . Nor was the reading list a surprise , featuring works by the Combes , Sweetser , the Fowlers , Graham , and Alcott.80 In a new twist , Alcott advised young men to study phrenology after learning about physiology . Though doubtful " that every thing which is called Phrenology is worthy of . . . confidence , " he thought that the mental faculties constituted an important branch of physiology . It was neither necessary nor desirable to become " adepts in this science , " but he encouraged young men to acquire " a practical general knowledge of the subject , " preferably by reading the works of the Combes and the Fowlers . He disagreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " believing many of them to be " soundly sensible . " The point of studying phrenology , even more than physiology , was to " make every thing practical . Apply the subject to your own personal improvement , either immediately or prospectively . " Wherever there seemed " a deficiency in your mental , moral , or corporeal structure , seek to supply it in the best manner . " 81 Corresponding to The Young Wife , in 1835 Alcott published The Young Hushand.82 There he stressed the male spouse 's various duties as a social , intellectual , and moral agent to his family and community . Again his advice was wide-ranging , and , though he did not shortchange health , he // felt free to limit his remarks , due to the full discussions in his other books . Once again , however , Alcott emphasized his belief that people could be healthy if they conducted themselves properly . Though following physical laws was important , Alcott also reminded his readers that morality was equally critical . Proclaimed Alcott , " To be healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he continued , to " understand the whole intention of Christianity . " This entailed realizing " that the salvation and sanctification of man includes his whole being ? body , soul , and spirit ? ... and that , until man is in this respect fully redeemed , the whole object of his divine mission to our earth will not be accomplished . " Legions joined Alcott and Graham in proclaiming the indissoluble links between physical and moral health . If all individuals in society could attain bodily and spiritual salvation , social redemption would be achieved as well . Legal safeguards about medical practice would be superfluous if Americans lived according to correct principles , such as those promulgated in William Alcott 's advice manuals . Vexing questions of medical legitimacy would also vanish or recede because citizens would be capable of recognizing qualified healers and because they would be more likely to respect the physician 's sphere . An Outpouring of Health Advice Guidebooks for young men and women proliferated during this period , and they typically promoted healthy and temperate living as the building blocks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Young Man , for instance , included a chapter on " Regular Hours " and one on " Temperance . " 83 Peter Parley 's 1836 Every Day Book for Youth briefly covered exercise , cleanliness , and diet . The point , as the best-selling author indicated a few years later in What To Do and How To Do It , was to cultivate the reason which God had bestowed on humans . Unlike man , animals were guided entirely by instinct . As a result , " we do not send animals to school , and give them books , for God is their teacher . " The situation was different for people , who were " to be educated , instructed , and by a gradual progress , elevated to that high destiny for which they are qualified . Instruction is the means by which we are to be taught our duty , and by which we may accomplish the end for which we were created . " But instruction alone was insufficient " unless we listen to it , and obey its teachings . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must pursue and do what is good and right . " 84 T S. Arthur 's Advice to Young Men on Their Duties and Conduct in Life , published in 1847 , offered a chapter called " Health . " Arthur , best known // for his enormously popular temperance classic , the 1854 Ten Nights in a Barroom and What I Saw There , began by stressing that " late hours , irregular habits , and want of attention to diet " were errors common to young men . These actions " gradually , but at first imperceptibly , undermine the health , and lay the foundation for various forms of disease in after life . " This was serious : " As health is the indispensable prerequisite to a proper discharge of the duties of life , every man is under obligation to society not to do any thing , which , by producing a diseased condition of the body , renders him unfit to attend efficiently to his work or office ... . No man stands alone in society , or can be independent of others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must faithfully and diligently do what he can for the common good . " 85 A more religious phrasing of this same view came in 1855 from E. H. Chapin 's Duties of Young Men . His first lecture , " Self-Duties , " had as its cardinal rule " a careful preservation of the health . " Chapin preached the importance of living according to God 's will : " Live that you may not in any way weaken your ability to do good to yourselves or to others . " H6 Sometimes writers went beyond rules for healthy living and advised on sickroom conduct . One example is the unknown author of The WellBred Boy and Girl , who devoted one chapter of the 185o text to " The Sick Chamber . " 87 The chapter was written from the vantage point of Alfred , a little boy who awoke one day , " hot and uncomfortable " and plagued with " a bad headache . " Judging him to be quite ill , Alfred 's mother sent for the doctor , who wanted to examine his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . " The youngster was recalcitrant , for he " felt sick and heavy , and did not like very much to be disturbed ; but his mother told him that the doctor could not do any thing for him unless he could carefully examine him , and see what was the matter . " Convinced , Alfred " opened his mouth as wide as he could .... He told the doctor exactly how he felt , not describing his feelings as any worse than they really were , that he might be pitied a great deal , nor telling of them as if they were not so bad , that he might escape taking medicine , but the exact truth . " Soon the doctor told Alfred he had the measles , which was " troublesome . . . , but not often . . . dangerous . " As the disease progressed , Alfred tried to bear the pain as well as he could . He rested quietly and " took exactly what his mother and the doctor thought would be best for him . " Alfred 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , " he did not stop to think about it , and look at it , and shudder , and turn away ; this , he knew , would make it much more difficult for him to get it down ; but he opened his mouth wide , gave one good manly // swallow , and it was all over . " As he improved , he was served " gruel , and broth , and some things . . . he did not love very well . " In response to his complaints , " his mother told him it was better for his stomach than his usual food . " Responding to this reasoning , Alfred " tried to think it tasted good ; he knew it had been fixed on purpose for him , and he tried to make the best of it , and found it tasted , on the whole , rather better than he expected . " By his compliant behavior , " he spared himself and those about him a great deal of pain , " and he quickly recovered his health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health is " and made him more sympathetic to other sufferers . It is hard to imagine that many of Alfred 's flesh-and-blood contemporaries were so angelic , but to encourage imitators , writers promulgated criteria about how to be an ideal patient.88 Similarly didactic health stories featuring child and adult characters were often found in the women 's magazines and annual gift books that were so popular in antebellum America . There was also more practical written advice available to middle-class citizens . Magazines as diverse as DeBow 's Review , the North American Review , the Southern Literary Messenger , and Peterson 's Magazine included articles on public and private health matters.89 Periodical literature , however , rarely touched life 's most intimate aspects . For advice about sexuality , Americans after about 1830 could turn to a burgeoning advice literature , much of it semilicit . Sylvester Graham was an important figure here , using lectures and books to urge the sexual restraint that was integral , with his dietary ideas , to what Nissenbaum has called his " physiology of subsistence . " 90 William A. Alcott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Physiology of Marriage , first published in 1855 , reached twenty-seven thousand copies by 1866 and went through at least seven editions.91 They were joined by many others who feared the immediate and long-term effects of " the solitary vice " ( masturbation ) and sought to inform the population about the importance of sexual hygiene.92 Nonetheless , explicit anatomical and physiological details about sexuality tended to be beyond the scope of antebellum authors on sexual hygiene , as they were for their counterparts writing anatomy and physiology schoolbooks . Cookbooks also advised about health , primarily by offering dietary suggestions for both healthy and sick people . One of the most popular was Sarah Josepha Hale 's 1839 The Good Housekeeper , or the Way to Live Well and To Be Well While We Live . The first edition had sold two thousand copies in one month , bragged Hale as she readied the second edition for publication later that same year ; by its 184o third printing she was claiming its production to have already reached three thousand . The // fifty-cent volume contained " directions for choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taste . " The laudatory review in Godey 's Lady 's Book pointed out as well that her health precepts had been " compiled from Dr. Andrew Combe 's most valuable work . " 93 Indeed , Hale was another significant figure in health popularization , enormously influential through her editorship of Godey 's . Her editorial career began in 1828 with the first issue of the Ladies'Magazine and continued forty years beyond its 1837 merger with Godey 's Lady 's Book . Under her direction the magazine 's circulation increased from roughly ten thousand in 1837 to a reported one hundred fifty thousand by 186o . From her editor 's chair Hale was a tireless champion of exercise , fresh air , proper diet , and sensible dress . Articles on health appeared on virtually every subject in virtually every number . Thus readers could learn about hygienic rules , calisthenics , the causes of consumption , health and beauty , diet , useful medical books , and related topics.94 The 18S3 Ladies ' Indispensable Assistant and similar volumes of miscellany resembled contemporary women 's magazines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one did seem to offer almost everything , including " the very best directions for the behavior and etiquette of ladies and gentlemen , ladies ' toilette table , and directions for managing canary birds . " It also printed recipes intended to " form a complete system of family medicine and enable each person to become his or her own physician . " The majority of its pages , however , presented recipes comprising " one of the best systems of cookery ever published , " a sure guide to maintaining or regaining health.95 Cookery was but one part of household management , and guides to " domestic economy " appeared during this period as well . They too included advice about healthy living . Lydia Maria Child 's best-selling American Frugal Housewife was published in 1832 and was in its twelfth edition seven years later , but Catharine Beecher 's Treatise within two years , and it was reprinted nearly every year from 1841 to 1856 . Together with a supplementary receipt book , reprinted fourteen times between its 1841 appearance and the 1869 publication of The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Beecher 's Treatise pulled together in one volume practical material related to homemaking that previously had been available only in disparate locations . Thus she not only discussed plumbing and housebuilding , but she also probed matters of health , diet , hygiene , and general well-being . Unlike Child 's volume , which gave treatments // for common ailments and injuries , Beecher placed her advice within the larger framework of anatomy and physiology.96 Beecher 's approach foreshadowed a new thrust in the dissemination of health information to Americans . Orthodox doctors , waging war against quackery , continued to support the efforts of health popularizers as long as they did not try to undermine or usurp the physician 's role in treatment . Regardless of the very real importance of the diffusion of the kinds of health information discussed in this chapter , the regulars became increasingly convinced that its provision alone was ultimately inadequate to the task of guaranteeing a healthy population . With only general behavioral guidelines , even the well-intentioned and committed individual might easily lose his or her moorings . During the mid-nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the necessary and ideal complement : school texts in anatomy , physiology , and hygiene . As William Alcott lectured parents in 1853 : " You are bound to see that anatomy , physiology and hygiene are taught ? not in that profoundly scientific way which is desirable and even indispensable in the professional schools , but in a plain and popular manner ? in all the schools of the land . " ? Education in the schoolroom would not only complement and reinforce the work of parents and other adults , but it would constitute another powerful alternative to political action to achieve the good society . This battle and its warriors next demand our attention . 5 The Pedagogical Crusade " It may be an easy thing to make a republic , but it is a very laborious thing to make republicans . " 1 The words belonged to Horace Mann , the person whose name was virtually synonymous with the mid-nineteenthcentury public school movement . " The common school , " Mann announced in 1841 , " is the greatest discovery ever made by man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities , Griscom served as town superintendent and trustee of public schools in Burlington , Massachusetts . " The prosperity of the common , district , or public school , " Griscom proclaimed in 1847 , was " the surest test of the enlightenment of any district , ? of any country . It is the thermometer of civilization . " 2 What made the common school so special ? After all , many other educational opportunities existed : household education , charity schools , town-sponsored classes , church-supported ventures , and quasi-public academies . These same mid-century years saw the birth of infant schools , high schools , and schools for special groups , such as the feeble-minded or blind . The most important feature of the common school , however , was that it was supposed to be open to everyone . It would , its promoters claimed , properly educate children by systematically spreading knowledge , nurturing virtue , and cultivating learning . Among the results they anticipated were social harmony and enhanced morality , both of which were deemed to be crucial for the future of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized that the Revolution was still incomplete because of its very nature : " Revolutions working down among the primordial elements of human character ; taking away ascendancy from faculties which have long been in subjection ; ? such revolu-140 // tions can not be accomplished by one convulsive effort , though every fibre in the nation should be strained to the endeavor . " The political upheaval of the I77os had freed the colonists , but liberty had also removed many historical restraints to human passions . Post-Revolutionary leaders feared that unless morality checked passion and physical force , the blessings of liberty would be worse than the evils of tyranny.3 As part of his work as secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education from 1837 to 1848 , Mann achieved some of the goals articulated by William A. Alcott and other health reformers . Dismayed in 1842 to discover how few Massachusetts students were being taught physiology , Mann contended that the subject should " claim rightful precedence , " for it was " an exposition of the laws of health and life . " Knowledge of physiology would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of vigor , usefulness , and enjoyment , " which would increase their " ability to perform the arduous duties and to bear the inevitable burdens of life . " 4 As Mann continued the crusade in subsequent lectures , essays , and annual reports , support for his position gradually grew . In April 185o the state legislature passed a law requiring that physiology and hygiene be taught in Massachusetts schools and that candidates to teach these subjects be examined for competence . Implementation was problematical and slow , and the introduction of physiology textbooks lagged behind that of more traditional subjects , such as reading , grammar , arithmetic , geography , history and spelling . Nonetheless , in Massachusetts and gradually in other states , a commitment to offering physiological instruction in the schools did begin to take hold.5 A similar trend was evident in the nation 's academies and colleges.6 Citizens of this generation witnessed the first concerted attempt to disseminate knowledge about disease prevention and health promotion , downplaying or omitting altogether information about disease treatment . Imbued with the perfectionism and pietism prevalent at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their crusade as much in terms of moral as physical redemption. ? The appearance of this literature also coincided with growing awareness among Americans of the pathbreaking work being done in France by Pierre Louis and the Paris School . Using observation and statistical methods on large hospital populations , French clinicians documented the inefficacy of much of the orthodox materia medica . Americans greeted the French findings with much ambivalence and debated their implications for medical theory and practice . Some physicians followed Harvard professor Jacob Bigelow 's lead when he conceded in 1835 that some diseases were " self-limiting " and that in such cases the doctor should not interfere with // the healing powers of nature . Many doctors , however , were not only skeptical of the Paris School 's claims , but they were also hostile . One reason for this hostility was that though the Paris School 's methods and findings helped eradicate harmful practices , the fact that they so avoided experimentation meant that they could propose very few therapies or explanations to substitute for what they discredited . Some Americans did advocate using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had little success until German experimental methods became influential after the Civil War . 8 In this situation popular physiologists played a pioneering role that scholars have previously underrated.9 They anticipated and showcased what their postbellum counterparts were to capitalize upon decades later : that burgeoning knowledge of anatomy and physiology could and should be used as a strong foundation for the study and teaching of hygiene.1 " Especially in a time of acknowledged therapeutic uncertainty , the study of prevention , they argued , was essential . First the French and later the German findings dovetailed with the prevailing climate of social reform in America to give the crusaders for hygienic living significant medical credibility and cultural authority . As this group of writers turned to schools as the vehicle for enlightening Americans about proper living , they simultaneously contributed to the more and more precise delineation of nonprofessional and professional roles in health and medicine . In so doing , the crusaders introduced and developed a new type of health literature , the school text for anatomy , physiology , and hygiene . These books provided increasingly systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiology ) , and derivative rules for proper living ( hygiene ) . With this knowledge , health popularizers enthused , nonprofessionals could realistically assume responsibility for prevention . Faust Catechisms as Transitional Texts In 1797 physician Elihu Hubbard Smith , one of the " Hartford Wits " and a founder of the New York Medical Repository , wrote his sister , Mary S. Mumford , and suggested that she read " Dr. Faust 's Catechism of Health ' ; a work designed for children , but more proper for parents , &; those who have the immediate charge of children . " He had read the book himself in December 1795 , recording in his diary that " with some exceptions , it is a good book . Much of it is excellent . " The Germans , he thought , should be commended . " More of their men of learning &; genius have turned their attention to the composition of their initial books ? for the aid of children ? &; the unlearned. " ' // According to Charles Carpenter , Bernhard G. Faust 's Catechism was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation from the German appeared in Boston and Philadelphia in 1795.12 It is true that Faust claimed that his book was for schoolchildren and that he used a catechismal format that would have been familiar to youngsters . But it is misleading to classify Faust 's Catechism as even an embryonic form of the soon-to-emerge physiology , anatomy , and hygiene textbook . Rather , Faust 's book had much more in common with existing written traditions of health education , particularly the longevity text , with its emphasis on providing general guidelines for the proper way to live . Faust 's Catechism also shared features of contemporaneous domestic health guides , for it gave instructions about what to do in the event of illness . Later , derivative editions bore no greater similarity to the nascent physiology text nor were they addressed primarily to children . But they were increasingly explicit about parental responsibilities for child care , revealing and reinforcing the larger cultural trends discussed especially in chapters 2 and 4 . Religion shaped Faust 's view of sickness and health . As the eminent German physician explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible without good health , for sickness ran counter to God 's will . He thought most people sinned because they knew little about the human body , so he sought to educate by presenting more than four hundred sets of questions and answers , recapitulating important points in occasional illustrations and frequent " Observations " and " Addresses to Children . " 13 The first section , " Of Health , " constituted nearly three-fourths of the tome . Faust admitted that fifteen of his twenty-one chapters " regard grown-up persons as much as children , " and the range of subjects included the non-naturals , alcoholic beverages , tobacco , beauty , and even lightning and thunder . A lengthy passage summarized Faust 's central message by spelling out the characteristics of the " truly happy " person who " enjoys terrestrial bliss " and could , " anticipating the joys of eternal felicity , brave all the horrors of death . " That individual would have been born to and educated by " healthy , strong , sensible , and industrious parents . " Blessed from infancy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taught by his or her parents to be clean , temperate , neat , persistent , and industrious . The adult citizen , Faust concluded , would be exemplary : he would " work six days out of seven for the maintenance of a wife and children , " and he would " fear God , love mankind , and ( dol Justice . " 14 The remainder of Faust 's work , " Of Diseases , " distilled information // contained in domestic health guides and especially emphasized prevention and nursing . When stricken , people should remain " tranquil and composed " and immediately consult a learned physician , surgeon , or apothecary . Under no circumstances , warned Faust , should anyone rely on quacks , domestic medicines , secret nostrums , universal medications , or witchcraft . To ensure successful treatment once the doctor had arrived , it was the patient 's responsibility to give the doctor an exact and accurate account of everything that had happened from the beginning of the illness through the time of the doctor 's arrival . If it were impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , " some intelligent person " should draw up an " exact and circumstantial statement of his case " to be sent to the physician . Once medicines had been prescribed , the patient should take those medicines " faithfully , regularly , in due time , and in the dose prescribed . " 15 Like those writing household health guides , Faust also had advice for the invalid 's attendants . " A patient , " he explained , " is a poor , helpless creature , oppressed by anxiety and pains , " and therefore should be treated " with the greatest tenderness , kindness , and affection . " Faust offered precise guidelines about every aspect of the sick chamber and then discussed briefly the principal therapeutic agents of heroic medicine : bleeding , clysters , purgatives , and blisters . General instructions followed on how to treat wounds , contusions , ulcers , scalds , and sore nipples . Faust gave little attention to contagious diseases other than smallpox , which he thought " as bad as the plague ! " He hoped that omitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage nonprofessionals from treating disease . Instead , he tried to encourage proper living by discussing prevention ; when disease did strike , the appropriate role for the lay person was nursing . Faust 's book was innovative in two important ways : its purported audience ? schoolchildren ? and its use of the catechismal format . Yet Faust also addressed his remarks to parents , and the information he imparted had much in common with older written traditions of health literature , the longevity text and the domestic health guide . Given its stress on building model citizens , it is not surprising that it got a warm reception from Americans interested in creating and sustaining a strong republic . Despite Charles Carpenter 's claim , Faust 's Catechism did not break new ground by covering anatomy , physiology , and hygiene . Nor did later versions of the book , though they remained congenial to the republican temperament . In 18io an anonymous derivative , A New Guide to Health , appeared in Newburyport , Massachusetts . Compiled and adapted from Faust 's CateThe // chism by Edinburgh physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent practitioners , particularly Anthony F M. Willich 's Lectures on Diet and Regimen and James Parkinson 's Medical Admonitions . Despite its more learned tone , the book still sought to appeal to a broad audience , especially families and schools . The author stressed that the catechismal format had great advantages for a schoolbook , because " the frequent , and seemingly needless repetitions " would help readers remember and apply what they read . The intention was neither " to convert School-masters into Doctors , " nor to make children " adepts in medical knowledge . " The point was to spell out how to maintain health and prevent disease , particularly through " Temperance , Prudence , and Cleanliness . " 16 The author obviously envisioned parents as an integral part of his audience . How parents handled their infants and children , he said , determined whether " a good or bad constitution is formed . " A good constitution was all-important , not only for the child 's later " health and usefulness . . . but likewise for the safety and prosperity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Anthony F M. Willich and new to the 1810 text , gave explicit instructions about childhood diet , clothing , exercise , sleep , ventilation , and cleanliness.17 Only the catechismal format and the author 's stated intentions distinguish this advice from that found in guides for the proper management of children . Yet the anonymous 1810 New Guide to Health was also very similar to Faust 's 1795 Catechism . Though the illustrations and many of Faust 's " Observations " and " Admonitions " are missing , the volume 's overall meaning is unchanged , and the language is in many cases exactly or nearly the same . Even the new material , much of it related to medicine and disease treatment , seems quite familiar.18 Despite the modifications made in the 1810 version , it remains a hybrid of two genres , the longevity text and the household health manual . Much the same is true of William Mayor 's 1819 version of The Catechism of Health . Mayor was a popularizer , a British writer who wrote a number of school texts , including biographies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scriptural passages used copiously in earlier editions , though he still favored using a religious framework to interpret matters of life and well-being.19 In fact , though Mayor 's edition was substantially shorter than its 1810 predecessor , its thrust was nearly identical , primarily because its questions and answers were more broadly conceived . ' ' This edition of The Catechism of Health did more strenuously promote the importance of childrearing , suggesting that parents remained an important constituency for the book . Mayor // thought that it would be " wise and humane in governments " to ensure dissemination of proper knowledge about childrearing , for " every nation should be considered as one great family , of whom the rulers are the head , or parents . " Even though Mavor believed that parents usually had good intentions for their children , he felt that they too often acted out of ignorance or superstition . Educating parents , he wrote , would not entail " usurping the province of the physician , " but would equip them and their children to carry out their own duty : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice about proper living in a vein reminiscent of the longevity text , but , like guidebooks for mothers , it gave even greater priority to spreading knowledge about childrearing.21 The 1831 Catechism of Health was yet more unabashed about seeking parental readers , particularly mothers . It appeared under the aegis of Henry Porter , the Philadelphia publisher of the Journal of Health , the Journal of Law , and the Family Library of Health . Labeling it the " ladies ' edition , " Porter said it encompassed " plain and simple rules for the preservation of the health and vigour of the constitution from infancy to old age . " 22 There were no biblical verses embellishing Porter 's Catechism , and there were fewer and more indirect references to Divine intentions and agency . Like previous editions , this one taught that it was largely within each person 's control to be healthy , since most diseases resulted from an individual 's " own ignorance , folly , vice , or imprudence . " Being attentive to health was also a moral obligation , Porter emphasized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage in certain active and necessary employments . " Since " the want of health " was obviously incapacitating , " the care necessary to preserve the body from disease must necessarily be numbered among the duties of indispensable obligation . " Porter provided minute advice on every subject , whether it was the frequency of foot washing according to season , or the proper garments for children , piece by piece . Though Porter 's topical arrangement differed substantially from earlier editions , the subjects he covered in his first division corresponded closely to those treated in earlier texts . The most pronounced shift was Porter 's advocacy of a vegetable diet , which he argued would make people " more strong and robust , " not " weak and stunted " as critics charged . This stance was not surprising , given Porter 's publishing connections with health reform.23 It was in the second division of his book that Porter deviated most from the design used in previous editions . Porter did not discuss diseases , medicines , or doctors , but instead set himself the task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ordinary circumstances , .. . // to ensure the health of the body , and . . . the tranquillity of the mind . " The ensuing discussion centered on different periods of the day and the meals normally consumed during them.24 Regardless of differences in design and content between Porter 's Catechism and the Faust Catechism from which it was derived , Porter 's book bore no greater resemblance to an anatomy and physiology text . Moreover , because Porter , unlike Faust , omitted information about disease treatment and medicine , his 1831 version was in fact a detailed guide to healthy living . Not everyone , however , viewed this as an unadulterated blessing . Indeed , its appearance , together with that of Porter 's popular Journal of Health , provoked lengthy consideration in the Western Medical and Physical Journal.25 The reviewer used the device of " a venerable female friend " to articulate and counter the central objections made to the entire genre of popular health literature . The " fair quintagenarian " featured in the article railed against the outpouring of health books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their health . As she phrased it , " The tendency of the whole , is to subject to artificial rules , that which can be safely confided only to the instincts , appetites , and experience , of each individual . " The healthiest people , she insisted , were the ones who paid the least amount of attention to their well-being . Health , she believed , was the " natural " result of a person 's " industrious pursuit " of those objects for which he or she was created . The quintagenarian did not deny that an individual might " have excellent health , while observing the minute and multiplied precepts of the Journal and Catechism , but it by no means follows , that he would not have been equally well , if these entertaining books had never been written . " It was her contention that " such works , like treatises on domestic economy , can but embody the experience of the world , in reference to which each individual might safely be left to appropriate to himself , such a portion as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final objection was " that to live , move , and have our being , beneath a written code of hygienic laws , is to be subjected to a new dominion , in addition to those which society had already imposed . ' " The reviewer conceded the quintagenarian 's point that " much depends on a good natural constitution , and still more on exposure and hard labor in the open air . " Beyond this , he wrote , the woman 's analysis and expectations were naive , because she assumed that everyone had inherited a solid constitution and enjoyed a decent standard of living . But this was far from the case . Especially for people who lived in the artificial and stressful atmosphere of cities , " some organs are overworked , others Ian148 The Pedagogical Crusade guish in sloth ; this is kept in perpetual irritation , that in stagnation and torpor ; the temptations to improper indulgences of every kind , are greatly multiplied ; the appetites are bribed and pampered ; the dominion of fashion is mad and tyrannical . " The results could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , are generated ; children are born with frail constitutions ; and their native tendencies to disease , await but the action of slight exciting causes , to rouse them into fatal energy . " Given this reality , the reviewer saw two possible choices : passively succumb to illness and premature death ; or actively seek health and longevity . Popular health literature would help those who wanted to join the battle against disease and for health . The writer praised the Catechism as " strictly didactic , and totally divested of all references to authorities , and of every extraneous embellishment . " The book was , in fact , " a rigid elementary and practical treatise on hygeine , " designed " to sustain the attention of the reader , and render the various subjects intelligible to the humblest capacity . " The reviewer thought it was " a valuable family book " and a subject that all young people should be required to study . This endorsement notwithstanding , there were other Americans who would have agreed at least in part with the unhappy quintagenarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits conferred on society by " books on the art of health , " some form of which had , after all , been in existence for centuries . Like her , however , they would have agreed that obeying hygienic rules as described in such volumes would be " artificial " and unreliable . Her solution was to cease publishing such books ; theirs was to broaden the context in which the laws of hygiene were discussed . The result was a new type of health literature that sought to educate nonprofessionals about hygiene by teaching them basic anatomy and physiology . " Rational Hygiene " Many people undertook the task of educating mid-nineteenth-century American students , both elementary and more advanced , about proper living . Some used variations on the question-and-answer format , but over time their books resembled Faust 's work less and less because they gave as much space to anatomy and physiology as to hygiene . This change in approach grew out of the conviction that a person 's ability to live correctly was directly related to how much that person understood about the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hygiene were fundamentally inseparable , a message underThe // lined by Amariah Brigham 's important Remark 's on the Influence of Mental Cultivation and Mental Excitement upon Health . Published in Hartford in 1832 , it quickly went through four printings in America and three in England . The young doctor believed that Americans had the capacity " to become the most vigorous and powerful race of human beings , both in mind and in body , that the world has ever known . " To accomplish this , Brigham urged repeatedly , it was essential that " the whole plan should be improved , " body as well as mind . ' ' -c ' Brigham 's maxim for living was " mens sana in corpore sano , " said a reviewer in the Western Medical and Surgical Journal . This he applied to every aspect of existence . " If any organ or faculty , either of the body or mind , be neglected , " summarized the reviewer , " it falls into debility and disorder and never fails to react on the others and limit their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brigham argued that " all plans of education " should be founded on anatomical and physiological study . The " general neglect " of these subjects was both an " extraordinary " and " most lamentable evil . " 28 The similarity of Brigham 's views to those of phrenologists is striking . Following in the footsteps of Johann Gaspar Spurzheim and Franz Joseph Gall , European phrenologists constructed elaborate theories to explain the interrelations of anatomy , physiology , and well-being , which included morality2 ' The American version of phrenology was more practical , increasingly divorced from its theoretical underpinnings and billed as a literal guide to living . ' ' " As John Davies has documented , phrenology had an astonishing impact on mid-nineteenth-century American workers in education , medicine , mental health , and many other fields . Congenial with the perfectionistic and pietistic temper of mid-nineteenth-century America , phrenology posited the infinite perfectibility of human beings ; if an individual were only cognizant of his or her inherent propensities for good or ill , he or she would then possess a personalized blueprint for improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental , and moral qualities and the stress on human perfectibility ? filtered through American thought.31 Andrew Combe , a Fellow of Edinburgh 's Royal Society of Physicians , enjoyed enormous popularity as a phrenologist , eclipsed only by that of his brother George , best known for his 1828 Constitution of Man . Andrew Combe 's 1834 Principles of Physiology was an influential European precursor of a type of physiology text that became increasingly common in mid-nineteenth-century America . Published in a stereotype edition in Harper 's Family Library series in 1836 , Combe 's title promised that these physiological principles would he " applied to the preservation of health , // and to the improvement of physical and mental education . " Physiology was in Combe 's view nearly all-encompassing , since " in its widest sense " it embraced the study , maintenance , and interactions of bodily functions and processes . The object of studying physiology was " to secure for the organ the best health , and for the function the highest efficiency . " This definition had significant implications for the conduct of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper basis , not only of a sound moral and intellectual education , and of a rational hygiene , " but it was also " the basis of every thing having for its object the physical and mental health and improvement of man . " 32 Combe echoed writers of orthodox health guides in denying any desire to teach nonprofessionals about medicine or disease treatment . Like those writers , he wanted to spread the kind of information that would allow individuals to maximize their physical and mental abilities . This knowledge would also help people avoid many illnesses and facilitate the recovery process when sickness did strike . Most fundamentally , understanding and following physiological principles would " fit each individual for the particular sphere in which the Creator intended it to exist . " Combe 's overall purposes , then , were strikingly similar to those who wrote domestic health manuals . But his execution deviated sharply from that used both in household guides and the Faust texts . Combe systematically and thoroughly presented information about anatomy and physiology , deriving from that hygienic principles . Selective rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential ... and .. . least familiarly known " body systems . Thus Combe included chapters on the anatomy and physiology of the skin , muscles , bones , respiration , and nervous system . Some systems ? circulation , the senses , reproduction ? he omitted entirely , while " others of essential consequence ... , such as . . . digestion " he thought warranted only brief mention . Including the former , he argued , would have added unjustifiably to the welter of detail , while incorporating the latter would have been redundant , since treatises on digestion already existed.33 Most of the structures and functions Combe described were complicated , and he used some everyday examples to make the explanations easier to understand . Combe reminded his readers , for example , that coughing expelled foreign objects from the lungs " just as peas are discharged by boys with much force through short tubes by a sudden effort of blowing . " Speaking of the skin 's sebaceous glands , he likened one 's size to " a millet seed . " His most extended analogy simplified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , which proved helpful at the end of a lengthy and technical passage.34 // Combe , however , used few such comparisons in Principles of Physiology , a work intended for advanced rather than elementary audiences . Most of his text is scientific and theoretical , buttressed with information drawn from eminent medical authorities and clarified by a few illustrations . For example , Combe 's description of muscular action is scientific , though he also concedes that muscles " are familiar to every one as constituting the red fleshy part of meat . " Information on the skeleton is likewise given in scientific language , including the proper Latin names of bones . Combe 's discussion of the backbone combines familiar and technical language . " The spine , vertebral column , or back-bone ... , " he begins straightforwardly , " which supports all the other parts , is a very remarkable piece of mechanism . It is composed in all of twenty-four separate bones called vertebrae , from the Latin word vertere to turn , as the body turns upon them as on a pivot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combe further distinguishes among the cervical , dorsal , and lumbar vertebrae , all of which rest on the sacrum . Further explanation , while certainly not beyond comprehension , is less easily accessible : While the smooth or rounded forepart or body of the vertebrae affords support to the superincumbent parts , the projecting ridge behind , and rugged processes at the sides , combine with it to form a large tube or canal , extending from the top to the bottom of the column in which the spinal marrow is contained and protected . Between each of the vertebrae a thick compressible cushion of cartilage and ligament is interposed , which serves the triple purpose of uniting the bones to each other , of diminishing and diffusing the shock in walking or leaping , and of admitting a greater extent of motion than if the bones were in more immediate contact.3s Despite Combe 's technical presentation , he melded science and religion.36 The skin 's structure , enthused Combe , " like that of every other part of the animal frame , displays the most striking proofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was important to understand each part because God 's plan mandated that " every part has a use or function peculiar to itself . " Thus the structure of the cuticle , Combe explained , was " in admirable harmony with its uses , " which included protection , touch , perspiration , absorption , and body heat . Behavior that interfered with the skin 's work should therefore be avoided or at least curtailed.37 Combe 's purpose in covering the anatomy and physiology of the cuticle and other parts was to disseminate knowledge that could be practically applied . Since bodily parts and functions were so inextricably interrelated , wrote the phrenologist , any transgression , regardless of its seeming insignificance , was harmful . The reverse was also true : an action // that benefited one part would benefit all others.38 Obviously , then , uninformed people were in constant peril because they would not be able to understand the consequences of their behavior . Unfortunately , few people seemed interested in learning about their bodies . Healthy people tended " to look upon the effects of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of chance , subject to no fixed rule , and therefore little worth attending to , except when carried to palpable extremes , or in the cure of disease . " This attitude , Combe complained , was counterproductive , because illness usually arose from bad habits that " gradually , and often imperceptibly . . . ruin the constitution before danger is dreamed of . " Much temporal harm could be averted simply by following the laws of nature , wrote Combe with assurance , rejecting the widely held idea that disease resulted from circumstances beyond man 's knowledge and control , sent by a superintending Providence . After all , he reminded his readers , " The progress of knowledge , and the increasing ascendancy of reason , have already delivered us from many scourges which were regarded by our forefathers as unavoidable dispensations of an inscrutable Providence . " Notable examples were plague , smallpox , and ague . For Combe , the only convincing explanation was that disease resulted from " the direct infringement of one or more of the laws or conditions decreed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every bodily organ , and the knowledge and observance of which are to a great extent within our own power . " Though these laws were " invariable and unchanging , " they were not hard-and-fast rules that would guarantee good health if scrupulously followed . Instead , they were general principles , and sensible adherence to them would bring rewards . Moreover , because they were grounded in Divine authority , there should be no question about obedience.39 Evidently a large number of Americans were listening to Combe 's message . The editors of the American Medical Intelligencer thought Combe 's work had had a " surprising sale , " two American reprints having been issued at their 1837 writing . Combe , they reported , had estimated twenty thousand sold in England and America within two and one-half years of its publication . " Perhaps no other work , " they concluded , " has had a greater effect in diffusing a taste for the study of physiology through the community . " British reformer Harriet Martineau also remarked on the great American popularity of Combe 's Principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Characteristically acerbic , however , she judged Americans still poorly informed and lazy about matters of health and hygiene.a " // There were many who agreed with Martineau 's charges and sought to remedy the situation . The majority of them tried to reach the public through lectures , which had great appeal and authority during this period . Orthodox physicians generally applauded those lecturers , many of them women , who attempted in a serious and decorous manner to educate the public about anatomy and physiology.41 In 1844 the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal praised these " energetic and popular teachers . " They were " not a calamity , but a direct benefit ... so long as they simply explained the mechanism of the human body , in connection with the elements of physiology . " Lecturers increasingly used manikins , which simplified and improved their enterprise , not in the least because they replaced corpses for demonstration purposes , thereby substantially reducing the danger of offending or shocking the audience.42 Some physicians , like the conservative William Workman , were more critical , charging that the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host of itinerant lecturers , professors ' of physiology , ' phrenology , ' and ' psychology . ' " What Workman deplored was " their too often indecent exhibitions of manikins and pictures , and . . . their low ribaldry and obscene jests under the guise of science . " But Workman agreed that physicians did have an " important mission " : to " instruct the people on medical subjects " in order to destroy quackery.43 Anatomy and Physiology for Children Others during this period sought the same goals with different tactics , relying instead on the written word ? and , for the first time , trying to educate young people . In the two decades following the publication of Combe 's Principles of Physiology , nearly two dozen American authors produced popular anatomy and physiology texts . Most of the texts were reprinted several times , and many authors wrote more than one volume . Writers of physiology texts articulated increasingly concrete examples of the interconnections of structure , function , and behavior . Moreover , like the Catechism of Health and the Principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Textbook authors comprised a varied group . Most were orthodox physicians with strong but divergent interests in reform , particularly in the areas of medical education , public health , and popular medicine . Many had formal affiliations with schools , primarily at the college or academy level . Several , including nonphysician Catharine Beecher , were heavily involved in improving educational opportunities for women . Most , if not all , were veteran lecturers , and often their books grew out of or ac154 The Pedagogical Crusade companied that work . Certainly , their volumes complemented the nationwide efforts of both male and female lecturers on physiology , who attracted crowds during the middle decades of the nineteenth century . Given his ideas about " Christian physiology , " it comes as no surprise to find William A. Alcott prolific in schoolbook publishing as well . In the same year that Combe 's Principles of Physiology appeared , the health reformer published The House I Live In , much of it reprinted from volume i of his young people 's magazine , the Juvenile Rambler . The review in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chastised any physician who would " sneer at ... teaching little people even the outskirts of a science . . . considered difficult for their seniors . " Instead , argued the reviewer , regulars should support such efforts " to familiarize all classes of persons with the curious structure of their own bodies . " 44 Alcott 's book broke new ground . Unlike Combe 's Principles of Physiology or the Faust catechisms , The House I Live In was meant for children only . As a result , it is filled with clear illustrations , simple language , and common examples . Alcott 's textbook also highlighted anatomy to an unprecedented extent . To be sure , many household health guides had brief sections on anatomy , but they were actually surveys aimed at adults and meant to aid in treatment . In contrast , guides to healthy living did not typically spell out the anatomical or physiological underpinnings for their hygienic advice . Alcott 's book represented the first phase in the American development of a popular preventive literature grounded in anatomy , physiology , and hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed the body as a modern frame house , two stories in height , featuring a cupola with windows and doors , two pillars , a great post , a number of rooms , furniture , and many functions . In addition to the extended house metaphor , Alcott employed scientific concepts and images , using commonplace comparisons to make them easier to grasp . For example , he likened the shape of " the hollow where the femur is fastened " to " the inside of an eggshell , with the small end broken off . " The backbone 's twenty-four separate pieces stood " on the top of each other , much like a pile of cups and saucers . " The foot and its arch could be envisioned as a bridge with two abutments . Some joints he compared to common hinges , whereas others , he explained , " allow the parts that turn on them to move in every direction ; but it would be hard to find a door that will open sideways , upwards , downwards , backwards , and forwards , with equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relied heavily on his readers ' familiarity with ropes , particularly their properties when wet . In fact , he found it necessary to caution against interpreting his metaphor too literThe // ally . Wrote Alcott , " Nobody pretends these contrivances ' will shrink by wetting them , as ropes do , but they will shrink when we wish to have them . " Beyond this , he could offer no explanation . " How our thinking or wishing , or willing to have them contract , can make them do so , nobody knows . On this point , the wisest philosopher is almost as ignorant as a child . " 45 Yet human comprehension was not essential for Alcott , because , like Faust and Combe , he attributed the body 's construction to God . Alcott emphasized the pains " the Builder " had taken with the cupola , which encased and protected valuable and easily damaged goods . The result , he judged , was " a thousand times more ingeniously contrived , and wisely constructed , than if I had built it for myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand about their bodies , this did not weaken Alcott 's conviction about the larger design . For instance , there were four little bones " near the tympanum of the ear , and " nobody exactly knows for what purpose the Creator intended them . " This did not trouble Alcott at all , because he was confident that " every part of the ear is useful . " Moreover , marveled Alcott , " The Father of the Universe is the Preserver as well as the Creator of this wondrous frame . ' " Look for proof , he wrote , at the joints , which would not function without lubrication . God had anticipated this need , providing " synovia , which answers all the lubricating purposes of oil or tar , and continually oozes out on the inside of the ligaments at the joints , and keeps the ligaments themselves , and the joints , soft and moist . " Synovial fluid , Alcott pointed out , was " of just the right quality and quantity when we are in the most perfect health . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ; or it may be too thick or too thin . " It was therefore each person 's responsibility to maintain his or her body in conformity with God 's intentions.46 Alcott helped bridge two types of literature : older texts resembling both longevity guides and domestic manuals in their presentation of health advice , and newer ones that presented similar information in the context of anatomical and physiological knowledge . Much like William Buchan 's Domestic Medicine had been in its genre , The House I Live In was a pioneer in its field . As physiology textbooks themselves evolved in tone , presentation , and content , Alcott 's themes and techniques were borrowed , extended , and modified . Two of Alcott 's contemporaries , Jane Taylor and Worthington Hooker , wrote physiology texts aimed at the same very youthful audience . Taylor reverted to the catechismal style of Faust , but the contents of her books more closely resembled Alcott 's . Taylor 's evident interest in popularizing // physiology makes it tempting to postulate a link with health reform . Such suspicions , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primary Lessons in Physiology for Children was first printed under a shorter title in 1839 , and at least four stereotyped editions appeared before the revised version in 1848.48 Like Alcott 's , her book dealt primarily with anatomy rather than physiology or hygiene . Taylor also began with a house image , but she abandoned it in favor of lessons devoted to specific topics , usually different parts of the body . As she explained structures and their importance , Taylor , like Alcott before her , worked with everyday comparisons and familiar language . Thus her definition of the backbone made the one significant scientific term easily accessible . " It is , " she wrote , " that which runs from the head down the back , and is made up of twenty-four round pieces , like twenty-four rings piled one above the other . These pieces are called vertebrae . " Her explanation of how muscles enabled movement was equally prosaic . They functioned , she wrote , " by being lengthened out so as to be much longer at one time , and then again by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural length just as we can make shorter or longer a thin piece of India Rubber . " The skin , Taylor explained in another graphic portrayal , was " that which covers the body as the bark covers the tree . " Nerves she defined as " small parts of the brain which run off in every direction through the body . " The nervous system , by extension , constituted " those parts of the brain which are in small strings extended through the whole body . " Lungs could be imagined as " pieces of soft flesh filled with holes or cells , " resembling " a sponge . " Yet she could not convey every process so simply to her readers . When discussing food , she candidly admitted ignorance about " what turns chyle into blood . No one has yet found out ; neither do we know at what time it turns red . " 49 In 1858 Jane Taylor published another catechismal volume , Wouldst Known Thyself or The Outlines of Human Physiology . " Designed for the use of families and schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the title , Taylor once more focused primarily on anatomy rather than physiology . This time , however , she stressed hygiene as well , so that structure and behavior receive more attention than function . Her book contained , she boasted , " many useful hints about clothing , diet , exercise , health , and the care of the body generally . " It was easy to see how desperately people needed this information " from the simple fact , that neither parents nor children understand a word of physiology , but leave all that relates to their physical training and health to chance and the care of the doctors . " She hoped the book would open parents ' eyes to // " the wonders of our physical frame , . . . the wisdom and benevolence of the Creator in the adaptation of the parts to their ends , " and the health consequences of their " carelessness , neglect , exposure , and indulgence . " 50 Again she used the house metaphor , very nearly quoting herself exactly . As before , Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did continue to use commonplace expressions rather than scientific terminology . Many of her comparisons were new ones , as was her explanation that skull bones " are united like two saws when the toothed edges are pressed together . To make this comparison more exact , the saw-teeth should be a little crooked , so as to hook into each other . " Nor did she use scientific names when describing most of the other bones . The only leg bone she identified , for example , was the " knee-pan , " as opposed to the patella . She followed the same practice in discussing the structure of the eye : " The globe , or ball of the eye , has three coats or coverings around it , the same as a ball with three covers , and is placed in a deep bony socket in the skull . " The outside covering she called " the white of the eye . ' It is quite hard , " she continued , " and to it are fastened the muscles which move the eye in any direction desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the middle covering of the eye " could be found " a layer of very dark colored matter , which absorbs and softens the rays of light , after they enter the eye . " Taylor gave no scientific appellation for the " third or innermost covering of the eye , " characterizing it as " a flattening out or expansion of the nerve which connects the eye with the brain , and . . . the immediate seat of sight . " 51 Taylor also discussed ways in which human beings differed from other animals , a theme which was to be elaborated in later physiologies . Humans , she summarized , possessed a proportionately larger brain , articulate language , reason , imagination , wit , and humor . Most important , though , was that man had " the moral or religious faculty ; the faculty which tells man he ought to do right , and which gives him pain when he does wrong . " This meant that people were " capable of being educated in a career of endless improvement . " Animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their situations : " the first beehive , the first anthill , the first bird's-nest , the first beaver 's dam and dwellinghouse , the first spider 's web , have only been repeated through their countless generations , the last one being not only no more skillfully made than the first , but exactly like it . " 52 It was each person 's duty to understand and obey all of God 's laws , and physical rules could not be separated from moral laws . " Every family , " she advised , " should possess one or more works on Physiology , to conThe // suit as they would a Family Physician , ' and to teach them not only how to preserve health , but how health may be restored , when . . . it has become partially destroyed . " Taylor recommended obtaining Edward Jarvis 's Practical Physiology , William Alcott 's Laws of Health , and Calvin ' Cutter 's Anatomy , Physiology and Hygiene . Though it was not on her list , Taylor might well have praised Worthington Hooker 's The Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , the Yale physician 's volume was intended for less advanced pupils than the ones she actually recommended . First published in New York in 1857 , Hooker 's book had three separately paginated divisions to cover plants , animals , and the elements . The second part most resembles the work of Alcott and Taylor , beginning with Hooker 's use of house imagery to describe the body 's structure . " The body , " he wrote , " is the house or habitation of the soul , " a portable structure that could be " easily moved about , just as the soul wishes . " For this reason , it had " a great deal of machinery in it . " Important for proper functioning were the " little cords " of the soul " called nerves , running to all parts of this machinery , like telegraphic wires . " Other types of machinery accomplished other jobs , such as respiration , digestion , and circulation . " The soul resides in the top of this house , the brain . Here , it sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives message by them . Here it thinks and acts , and some of the time sleeps . " s3 Hooker likewise used unpretentious language and analogies drawn from daily life . Thus , to illustrate the fact that arteries were stronger than veins , Hooker wrote : " You sometimes see the hose of a fire-engine burst when they are working the engine very hard ; but , though your heart pumps away sometimes so fast and hard , as when you have been running , not one of all the arteries gives way . " To explain why and how the muscles moved , he reminded his readers that " the mind does not go out of the brain to them , just as a man goes out of his house among his workmen to tell them what to do . " Instead , " there are white cords , called nerves , that go from the brain to all parts of the body , and the mind sends messages by these to the muscles , and they do what the mind tells them to do . " Nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the wires of a telegraph . " Beyond this , explanation was more difficult . " This is done by electricity in the telegraphic office , but how the mind does it we do not know . " 54 There were other commonplace examples . Hooker used the increasingly conventional idea of India rubber to illustrate muscular activity , and he suggested examining a drumstick for an even more concrete example . The bones , he said , " arc to the body what whalebones are to an
