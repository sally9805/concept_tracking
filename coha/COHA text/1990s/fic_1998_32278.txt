ONE New Hope JUDD Thompson Jr . had always sized up situations quickly . It was clear to him that of the four kids who had fled to nearby New Hope Village Church during the greatest crisis the world would ever see , he was the oldest . The redhead , the only girl , had a hard , bitter edge to her . But still , if Judd had to guess , he would have said she was younger than he was . Ah , what did he care . How could he ever care about anything anymore ? The end of the world , at least the world as he knew it , had come . Millions all over the world had disappeared right out of their clothes , leaving every-thing but flesh and bone behind . It was n't that Judd did n't know what had happened . He knew all too well . As he had heard in church and Sunday school and at home his whole life , Jesus Christ had come back to rapture his church , and Judd had been left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the earnest visitation pastor of New Hope Village Church , Bruce Barnes , to explain that . Of all things , Pastor Barnes himself had been left behind . Bruce Barnes had spent the last several minutes telling Judd and the three other shell-shocked kids his own story . He finished by telling them there was still hope . Life would be miserable from now on , of course , and they would be alone except for other new believers , but it was not too late for them to come to Christ . Bruce had urged them to think about it and not to waste much time . The world had become dangerous overnight . With so many Christians disappearing from important jobs , the result was chaos . No one had any guarantees . Life was fragile . Judd was impressed that Bruce seemed so eager to convince them that their only hope now was to trust Christ . Judd knew it was the truth . He had to face himself , and he did n't like what he saw . His whole look , the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never really become a Christianall those things sickened him now . Why had he wanted to appear so old ? Why was it so important to him to know where he fit in every crowd ? Everything that ever mattered to him now seemed ridiculous . He had been a tough guy , a big shot , the one with all the plans and schemes . He had stolen his dad 's credit card and bought phony identification papers that said he was old enough to travel on his own . Yeah , Judd thought , I was a real player . But though Judd had come to some hard realizations about himself , he still had a major problem . There was no question Bruce was right . Judd did n't want to live without his family and without Christ . Though he knew he had had every chance and could have been in heaven with his parents and brother and sister right then , everything in him still fought to blame somebody else . But whom could he blame ? His parents had been wonderful examples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he still loved Jesus . If he could n't blame his family and he did n't want to blame himself , that left only God . He knew there was no future in blaming a perfect and holy God , but right then he had to admit that he did n't much care for God 's plan . Whatever happened to the idea that God loved everybody and did n't want anybody to die and go to hell ? What kind of a God would leave a sixteen-year-old kid without his family ? Judd knew he was n't thinking straight . In fact , he had to admit he was being ridiculous . But just then he did n't like God very much . He was mad at God because there was no one else to be mad at . Besides , Judd was grieving . No , his family had not died . But they might as well have . He was glad for them , he guessed , that they had gotten their reward for believing . But that was of little comfort to him . Bruce Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves a bit . Judd did n't see the point of that . Bruce began with the youngest boy , the little blond who appeared stocky and athletic . Judd was reminded of his own little brother , Marc . Marc and Marcie were twins , nine years old . Both had been tremendously athletic . While Judd had lost interest in sports after Little League , Marc and Marcie had seemed interested in every sport imaginable . They had both been dark-haired and younger and smaller than Ryan Daley , but still Judd found it hard to listen to the boy without thinking of them both . Already he missed them more than he could say . Just being around someone even near their age cut like a knife deep into his heart . Ryan was telling his story at just above a whisper . Judd could tell the boy had spent a lot of time crying that day . No doubt there would be more tears until he could cry no more . " I do n't know what I think about all this stuff you 've been saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think either of my parents went to heaven . For sure my mom did n't because she was killed on the road sometime this morning . My dad was listed with the passengers that went down in a plane crash . I do n't think he would have been one of those who disappeared . I mean , he was great and I loved him , but he never said anything about being a Christian or even going to church . " Ryan told about waking up to find his mother 's note and then hearing from the police about her death . When he stopped and buried his head in his hands , Bruce Barnes leaned forward and put a hand on his shoulder . " So you 've never , ever been in church before ? " " Well , not never , " Ryan managed , raising his head . " Somebody invited me to one of those Bible school things they have in the summertime at church once " " Vacation Bible School ? " Bruce said . " Yeah , that 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember much about it . My friendhis dad 's an airline pilotwanted me to go to church with him here . I never did . " " And who was that ? " " His name was Raymie Steele . He tried to tell me all about this , the way you just did . I thought he was nuts . " " What do you think now , Ryan ? " With that , Ryan buried his face in his hands again and sobbed . Bruce began to ask him something , but Ryan wrenched away and shook his head . Judd thought he knew exactly how Ryan felt . Bruce turned to Lionel Washington . Judd noticed that the lanky young boy with the smooth face and chocolate complexion had sat expressionless since they had begun . His wide , dark eyes seemed to rarely blink . He merely sat forward , his chin resting on his fist , listening . Judd could n't tell if he was interested or not , but something had brought him there . Bruce asked Lionel if he knew any of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . They rode the school bus together . " " How do you feel about all this ? " Bruce said . " Oh , " Lionel said , " this is nothing new to me . I know exactly what happened . You 're right , we all missed it . The real Christians have gone to heaven , and we 've all been left behind . " Ryan leaped from his seat and ran out , shouting through his sobs , " It 's not fair ! It 's not fair ! This is crazy ! Why would God do this ? " Judd , Bruce , Vicki , and Lionel watched him go . " Are n't you going to stop him ? " Judd asked Bruce . Bruce shook his head . " He 'll be back . Where else does he have to go ? " Lionel , who seemed to Judd to have been shaken by Ryan 's quick exit , finished his own story of having grown up in a Christian family and gone to church all his life , only to never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christ . " I do n't know how the rest of you feel , but I ca n't say I 'm surprised or that I did n't get exactly what I deserved . I do n't know if I believe there 's really still a second chance , but if there is , I want it . " " Believe me , there is a second chance , " Bruce said , " and I think it 's something you 'll want to take advantage of right away , do n't you ? " " You better believe I already prayed the prayer , " Lionel said . " If that 's what you mean . I told God I was sorry , begged his forgiveness , and asked him to save me once and for all . You 're saying it 's not too late ? " " That 's what I 'm saying . Welcome to the family . " " To tell you the truth , sir , " Lionel said , " I 'd rather be in heaven with my own family right now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judd was stunned at how much he and Lionel had in common , though they had never even seen each other before . Lionel , like Judd , also had a younger brother and sister . And Judd and Lionel had been raised in the church by Christian families . Now it was Vicki 's turn . " Well , " she began with a quavery voice , " I guess I should have known better too . " Judd noticed how young and scared she sounded for someone who said she was fourteen years old . Of course , he felt very young and scared himself just then , but she looked like a tough girl . Whatever edge there had been to her seemed to have been stolen away when her mother , father , and little sister had been raptured . She told her story about growing up in the trailer park , about the weekend beer brawls and dances that had one time , seemingly out of the blue , begun with an evangelist preaching for just a few minutes and resulted in her parents becoming Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vicki admitted , " but actually I hated it . I hated church , and I did n't want to have anything to do with religion . They kept telling me it was n't religion , it was Jesus , but I did n't see the difference . " " Now you do , of course , " Bruce said . " Of course , " she said . " Forgive me for being pushy , " Bruce said , " but what are you going to do about it now ? " Vicki looked down and busied herself tracing a pattern on the floor with the toe of her shoe . " Actually , even though I know you 're right , I just do n't want to make a decision like this while I 'm still in shock . " Bruce seemed to be trying gently to push her into seeing that , despite the trauma she had just been through , she really should n't take more time . " You know the truth . That makes it your responsibility to act upon it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not return his gaze . Her body seemed rigid . To Judd it seemed as if she was through listening or talking about it . He was surprised when she looked up and appeared to be listening when it was his turn to tell his story . Judd kept his account short . He merely mentioned that he too had been raised in a Christian home and knew exactly what had happened . He told of his plan to run away from home and be his own person , and how it had all come crashing down on him when the Rapture occurred while he was on a plane over the Atlantic on the way to London . " I have to say , though , Pastor Barnes , I feel like Vicki here . I know what I 'm supposed to do , what I should do , and what I 'm sure I will do . But I just feel too much pressure . I can hardly get my mind around the fact that I 'll never see my family again . " Bruce stood and moved near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my point ! If I 'm right and a seven-year period of tribulation begins soon , it 's unlikely any of us will live through it . We had better be prepared to see God , or we 'll wind up without him for all of eternity . " Judd knew Bruce was right , but he caught Vicki 's glance and knew the two of them were still determined not to be pushed . He only hoped that it was n't simply a pride thing . He was pretty sure it was n't . He was way past pride now . " I 'm sorry , Pastor Barnes , but I just need more time to deal with all of this , " Judd said . " Me too , " Vicki said . " Do n't be waiting too long now , " Lionel said . " I waited way too long as it is . " " I could n't have said that better myself , " Bruce said .                  @ @ @
