Abstract <p> Patients with short stature have a high incidence of voice and laryngeal abnormalities . In sixteen patients with short stature of various etiologies , these abnormalities appeared to be unrelated to hearing loss or other otolaryngologic problems . However , in many patients they were associated with typical symptoms and signs of voice abuse . Physicians and speech-language pathologists caring for patients with short stature should be alert for voice problems , and should consider instituting early voice education , diagnosis and treatment . Introduction <p> Individuals of short stature appear to have different speaking fundamental frequencies ( SFF ) when compared with normal subjects . In 1979 , Vuorenkoski examined 82 abnormally short children between the ages of 6 and 12 years , and reported that in Mulibrey nanism , Turner 's , and other syndromes representing prenatal growth failure , subjects had abnormally high-pitched voices. 1 Conversely , subjects with delayed growth or familial short staturetended to have abnormally low-pitched voices , especially males . Patients with Down 's syndrome were studied by several investigators. 2-4 In general , these patients had higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidence of otologic and speech abnormalities in a group of 45 patients with short stature due to Cornelia de Lange syndrome. 5 Our current study investigated 16 individuals with short stature from various causes . An extremely high incidence of voice abnormality was detected . <p> Patients and Methods Otolaryngologic history and physical examination , audiogram , high-frequency audiogram and assessment of voice function were performed on 16 individuals during a short stature clinic at Thomas Jefferson University . The patients also underwent comprehensive genetic assessment . The group included eight males and eight females . Ages ranged from 8 years to 56 years . Three of the individuals had no known etiology for their short stature . Six had achondroplasia . The rest of the sample included one patient each with the following conditions : cartilage-hair hypoplasia ; diastrophic dwarfism ; Hunter 's syndrome ; hypochondroplasia ; Larson 's syndrome ; Russell Silver syndrome ; and trichorhino-pharyngeal syndrome ( TRP ) . Results <p> The results of otolaryngologic and audiologic assessment ( except voice ) are summarized in Table 1 . Ten of the 16 patients ( 62.5% ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with normal hearing in the contralateral ear , four had high-frequency hearing loss , and only patient ( Hunter 's syndrome ) had hearing loss in the speech frequencies . High-frequency audio-grams were also performed ( 8,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz ) . Findings were consistent with expectations from routine audiograms , and no unusual high-frequency patterns were detected . Hearing levels and the presence of other otolaryngologic abnormalities did not correlate with the presence of voice abnormalities . <p> Evaluation of laryngeal function included indirect laryngoscopy , subjective description of vocal quality , objective measurement of fundamental frequency of a spoken /a/ , and the percentage of hard glottal attacks observed in a standardized reading ( the Towne-Heuer passage ) , as summarized in Table 2 . Only one patient , a 28-year-old woman with achondroplasia , had no laryngeal or voice abnormality . However , she demonstrated misarticulations of the/r/sound . Five of the 16 patients ( 31.25% ) demonstrated abnormalities of all four measures . Three of the 16 patients ( 18.75% ) demonstrated abnormalities on three of the four measures . Five of the 16 patients ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two patients ( 12.5% ) demonstrated abnormalities on only one measure . In both cases the etiology was unknown . One was a 30-year-old woman with high pitch , and the other was a 40-year-old woman with lower than normal pitch . <p> Ten ( 62.5% ) of the patients had normal larynges . Five of the patients had vocal folds described as edematous or with prenodular swellings . All five were under the age of 20 . Five ( 83.3% ) of the six patients below the age of twenty had edematous vocal folds . One 32-year-old patient had a goiter and a second branchial cleft cyst . One 27-year-old man with achondroplasia was a partially trained avocational singer . <p> Twelve ( 75% ) of the sixteen patients had voices which were described as either breathy , hoarse , containing glottal fry or of excessively low pitch , including five of the six patients below the age of 20 ( hoarse or breathy ) . One patient demonstrated misarticulated /r/ sounds , and one had a denasal resonance pattern . Both of these patients were in the achondroplasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For comparison , fundamental frequency data were ana lyzed using the norms and standard deviations ( S.D. ) described by Vuorenkoski et al. 1 Fundamental frequencies were considered too low or too high if they were below or above one standard deviation . However , in three cases , the patients ' fundamental frequencies were considered abnormal when found to be within less than 6 Hz of the maximum or minimum range of I S.D. In eleven subjects the obtained fundamental frequency was well above or below Vuorenkoski 's norms + 1 S.D. In two cases , the fundamental frequency was considered normal . Eight ( 50% ) of the patients had fundamental frequencies above Vuorenkoski 's norms . Higher than normal fundamental frequencies were seen in those patients diagnosed as having diastrophic dwarfism , Hunter 's syndrome , Larson 's syndrome , Russell Silver syndrome , one of the patients with short stature of unknown etiology and in three of the patients with achondroplasia . Lower fundamental frequencies were found in six ( 37.5 % ) of the cases , including those patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia , hypochondroplasia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in one patient with unknown etiology . One female patient with achondroplasia and one male patient with unknown etiology were found to have fundamental frequencies well within the range considered normal by Vuorenkoski and colleagues . <p> Excessive hard glottal attacks were found in five ( 83.3 % ) of the six patients below the age of 20 years . Only three ( 30% ) of the ten patients over 20 demonstrated high occurrence of hard glottal attacks . All of the five younger subjects with high percentages of hard glottal attacks were also described as having breathy or hoarse voices , and four of the five also had edematous vocal folds . This combination of findings is often seen in individuals who are misusing or abusing their voices . Three of the four younger subjects demonstrated higher than normal fundamental frequency of/a/and one subject , a 12-year-old boy , had lower than normal fundamental frequency . <p> Over 81.25% of this sample of short stature patients demonstrated deviance in two or more measures of vocal function . Only one subject , with achondroplasia , had no evidence of vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study is too small for valid statistical procedures , our findings tend to support Vuorenkoski 's report thai patients with prenatal growth failure have abnormally high pitches . Six of the nine subjects ( 66% ) with prenatal growth disturbance had abnormally high-pitched voices ( Table 3 ) . Two had lower than normal pitches ( both older woman ) , and one had an SFF in the normal range . This suggests a trend toward higher pitched voices in syndromes with prenatal growth retardation , although the finding is equivocal among the patients with achondroplasia . This study does not support the contention that patients with postnatal growth impairment have lower pitched voices . However , only four of our subjects were in this category . Of those , 50% had abnormally low voices , and 50% had abnormally high voices . With one exception , laryngeal abnormalities were found in all subjects below the age of 20 , as well as hoarse or breathy voices , and increased frequency of hard glottal attack . Four of the younger subjects also had higher than normal fundamental frequencies . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These symptoms and signs are typical in individuals who are abusing their voices . The association between symptoms and signs of voice abuse , and variations from expected SFF , support the assertion that the normal values used are appropriate for this population . <p> It appears advisable to evaluate younger short-stature individuals and to consider early preventive voice therapy . Because of the high incidence of voice and laryngeal abnormalities , personnel working with short stature populations should be educated to recognize these problems and to refer individuals to appropriate voice specialists for early diagnosis and treatment . <p> Reprint requests to : Reinhardt J.
