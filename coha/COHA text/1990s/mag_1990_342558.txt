Meet Grinby , Boingo , GeeGee , Slats , T.K. and Scopes , cousins of the popular Koosh Ball toy  --  a " cross between a porcupine and a bowl of Jell-O " that goes " koosh " when you catch it . <P> OddzOn Products , Kooshmakers to the world , has literally put a new face on its product . By Christmas , these six fibrous friends will sit beside cash registers at 30,000 stores nationwide . Price : $7 to $8 . <P> For the past three months , Koosh Kins have ranked among the top 10 non-TV- promoted toys , according to The Toy Book , a trade publication . Says associate publisher Jim Silver : " If ( ( OddzOn ) ) created some sort of animation , they could do even better . " That may be next . OddzOn hopes to spin off a TV program ( Koosh Kin Kartoons ? ) and may soon have Koosh Kins klinging to sleeping bags and lunch boxes .                @ @ @ @ @
