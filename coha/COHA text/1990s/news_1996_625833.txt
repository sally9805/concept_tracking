<p> Every week during the NFL season , a ritual as regular as weigh-ins and team meetings takes place . <p> At locker rooms around the league , seven players per team each grab a small bottle , strip and leave modesty at the bathroom door . <p> A doctor is waiting inside . While a player urinates into the bottle , the doctor watches , reducing the chance that someone else 's specimen is being substituted . The bottles are sent to a lab for analysis . <p> Welcome to the NFL 's anabolic steroid testing procedure , part of an aggressive program that has reduced crimes against football , the league says . Since 1990 , when the NFL introduced its random testing policy , only five players have been suspended for steroid violations . <p> It is a number that has produced more skepticism than admiration . <p> But what is the reality ? Is it that the raging steroid problem of the 1970s and 1980s has all but disappeared ? Is it that the league 's steroid policy is as effective as a 150-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced steroids ? <p> Many around the NFL insist steroid use has dried up . The test picks up traces of anabolic steroids  --  muscle enhancers with potentially dangerous side effects  --  and masking agents . <p> " " It 's safe to say that steroid use is pretty much gone , " said Ralph Tamm , a Denver Broncos offensive lineman . <p> " " I do n't care what anybody says , the use is down , " said Kim Woods , the Cincinnati Bengals strength coach and a long-time critic of steroid use . <p> Others say the use of muscle enhancers is a cat-and-mouse game that always will be part of life in the NFL . Those who do n't see that , critics say , have their heads in the sand . <p> " " I 'm not very intelligent about how they 're getting that stuff out of their system or how they 're masking it , but no one 's a fool , " said former Pittsburgh Steelers guard Terry Long , who was suspended for four games in 1991 after testing positive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his test was handled . <p> " " You 've got guys now who are 6-feet-6 , 300 pounds and running 4.7 40s . " The number of 300-pound players has increased dramatically since the NFL began random testing . Going into 1990 training camps , there were 65 . <p> Going into this year 's camps , there were 224 . But the physical characteristics of those players have many around the league arguing on the side of genetics , not artificial weight gain . <p> Steroid users generally add muscle while keeping their bodies sculpted . Few can look at the Dallas Cowboys offensive line  - -  averaging 323.4 pounds  --  and point to steroid use . The flabby belly on 320-pound guard Nate Newton looks more attributable to between-meal snacking than any pharmaceutical help . <p> Critics say , however , the league looks the other way when it comes to steroids . Long estimates 25 percent of all NFL players use the illegal substances . Big bodies , he and others say , mean big business . <p> " " Do you want to spend your money watching somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of health and human development at Penn State University . " " Or do you want to see bigger than life ? " <p> Players do n't know they are going to be tested until the morning of the procedure . Every week of the regular season , a computer randomly spits out the names of seven players from each team who are to be tested . Some players go the whole season without being tested . Some get tested six times or more . During the offseason , each player can be tested as many as two times . <p> In the past five years , the NFL has administered thousands of tests . Of the five players suspended , four tested positive for steroids . The fifth , former New York Giants offensive lineman Eric Moore , was arrested on charges of possessing steroids and human growth hormone in 1993 . <p> Dr. John Lombardo , the NFL 's drug adviser , said the low number of suspensions is somewhat misleading . Players who test positive for steroids are , after a review process , suspended for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no warning letter for a first offense . <p> But Lombardo said the public does not hear about the players who test positive in training camp and are waived before the season begins . Even counting those players , however , the number of players who test positive is less than 1 percent , he said . <p> " " The best analogy is that you 've got a room , and if we have no testing , there are doors and windows everywhere that they can come in , " Lombardo said . " " What we 've done is close and lock some of those doors and windows . There are still doors and windows open . <p> But the high-dose steroids that used to be rampant are gone . <p> " " It 's how much energy are they willing to expend to beat this . " Said former Atlanta Falcons player Bill Fralic , who retired two seasons ago : " " I would be naive  --  and you would be , too  --  to think there was n't any usage . " <p> Players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offseason , when testing is not as stringent . Several players interviewed said that , since the current policy was introduced in 1990 , they never had been tested during the offseason . <p> Theoretically , they could have weaned themselves off steroids before training camp began and benefited during the season from the strength gains they made in the offseason . <p> " " Are guys still doing steroids as much ? I do n't think so . <p> But if you 're going to roll the dice , I think the offseason is when you do it , " said former Broncos linebacker Tim Lucas , who said he never tried steroids . " " It 's not a high possibility you 're going to get called , but there is a possibility . Some guys are going to do it , regardless . " <p> Some players say more than 80 percent of linemen were taking steroids in the early to mid-1980s , when steroids were not a banned substance . With the introduction of random testing in 1990 , use has dropped . So has conversation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating . <p> Jacksonville Jaguars center Dave Widell said use is down significantly in the NFL but that one thing is needed for a frank discussion on steroids : truth serum . <p> " " People in the government are more willing to tell you the truth about aliens from outer space than your chances of getting the truth about steroids from players , " he said . <p> For the NFL , the great unknown is human growth hormone , which is produced synthetically and used to combat dwarfism in children . <p> League tests do not pick up HGH . <p> It costs money to beat the system . Before Lyle Alzado died of brain cancer in 1992 , he was spending about $ 30,000 a year on HGH and steroids . When Moore was arrested in Atlanta , Drug Enforcement Agency agents found $ 15,000 worth of HGH . <p> A 1991 Philadelphia Inquirer story quoted experts who warned that players simply were replacing steroids with HGH and hard-to-detect drugs that were even more dangerous . Has that happened ? <p> Woods , the Bengals strength coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is not rampant . <p> " " The league figured a way to take the popular part of it away from the players , " he said . " " Now , there 's a certain fringe doing the hard stuff . God knows what they might be doing . " <p> Human growth hormone increases muscle mass , but it also causes enlarged hearts and excessive growth in all tissues . It can affect insulin production , leading to a condition almost like diabetes . Bones thicken , and the forehead broadens . Users begin to look as if they 've inched back down the evolutionary ladder . <p> " " I knew one guy who used it , and you could tell , " said former Minnesota All-Pro defensive end Keith Millard , who retired after the 1993 season . " " I saw the guy go from 260 to 320 in a matter of months . He ended up having back trouble because of it . " <p> Users might not be getting what they think they 're buying . <p> Law enforcement officers say that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking oil or something even more basic : Water . <p> Long , the former Steelers player , says the league 's drug testing policy has one major flaw : It is not in the NFL 's interest to have a stream of players suspended for steroid use . <p> " " It would destroy the league almost , " he said . " " These guys are in this thing to make money . The league 's actually doing the testing . They decide who gets suspended and who does n't . It 's a joke . " <p> The league has heard all the conspiracy theories . Officials say those suspicions have the credibility of Elvis sightings . <p> But they say the steroid threat is real . <p> " " We always assume they are a step ahead of us , " said New York Giants general manager George Young , who believes steroid use has been reduced by the random testing . " " But we 're always trying to close the gap . " There is little doubt the league 's testing program has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion . <p> " " People you meet through friends will say , " Oh you guys are all on something , " ' Tamm said . " " We 're so big and strong , and they ca n't fathom that . Guys get tested all the time . Hundreds of guys are n't getting past the testing , that 's for sure . It 's genetics . "
