WORLD POPULATION , ONCE " EXPLODING , " is still V increasing and " momentum " ensures that it will do so for decades to Come . But fertility rates have tumbled . In Europe every country has fallen below replacement level . Some governments , especially France 's , are beginning to use financial incentives to restore fertility rates but the effort , if generous enough to work-by paying women to have a third child-could bankrupt the welfare state . In rich countries , a total fertility rate of 2.1 babies per woman is needed if population is to remain stable . But in the European Union as a whole the rate is down to 1.5 . Germany is at 1.4 , and Italy , Spain , and Greece are at 1.3 . The fertility rate in France is now 2.0 , or close to replacement . But the uneasy question is whether this is due to subsidies or to the growing Muslim population . All over the world , with a few anomalies , there is a strong inverse correlation between GDP per capita and babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can obviously afford lots of children . But very predictably they have fewer . Hong Kong ( 1.02 ) , Singapore , and Taiwan are three of the richest countries in the world , and three of the four lowest in total fertility . The countries with the highest fertility rates are Mali ( 7.4 ) , Niger , and Uganda . Guess how low they are on the wealth chart . Here 's a news item . Carl Djerassi , one of the inventors of the birth control pill , recently deplored the sharp decline of total fertility in Austria ( 1.4 ) , the country of his birth . A Catholic news story seized on that and reported that one of the pill 's inventors had said the pill had caused a " demographic catastrophe . " Austria 's leading Catholic , Cardinal Schnborn , said the Vatican had predicted 40 years ago that the pill would promote a dramatic fall in birth rates . Djerassi , 85 , an emeritus professor of chemistry at Stanford , did warn of a catastrophe and he said that Austria should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller families " because of the availability of birth control . " They do so " for personal , economic , cultural , and other reasons , " of which " changes in the status of women " was the most important . Japan has an even worse demographic problem , he said , " yet the pill was only legalized there in 1999 and is still not used widely . " ( Japan 's fertility rate is 1.22 . ) ( In fact , if the pill and abortion really were illegal more children surely would be born , if only because unintentional pregnancies would come to term . ) Austrian families who had decided against children wanted " to enjoy their schnitzels while leaving the rest of the world to get on with it , " Djerassi also said . That may have rankled because the country had just put his face on a postage stamp . SO WHAT IS CAUSING these dramatic declines ? It 's under way in many countries outside Europe too . In Mexico , fertility has moved down close to replacement level- having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviously economic growth has been the dominant factor but there are other considerations . Young couples hardly read Paul Ehrlich before deciding whether to have children , but scaremongering authors have played a key role in creating our anti-natalist mood . Books warning of a ( then ) newfangled emergency , the " population explosion , " began appearing soon after World War II . Consider Road to Survival ( 1948 ) , by William Vogt , or People ! Challenge to Survival , by the same author . An antipeople fanatic before his time , Vogt was hypnotized by the Malthusian doctrine that population growth would overtake the food supply . That would lead to a war of all against all . Paul Ehrlich projected that the 1980s would see massive die-offs from starvation . ( Obesity turned out to be the greater health threat . ) In that earlier period , the population controllers did n't feel they had to mince words . Vogt wrote in 1960 that " tens of thousands of children born every year in the United States should , solely for their own sakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hundreds of thousands of others , technically legitimate since their parents have engaged in some sort of marriage ritual , but whose birth is as much of a crime against them as it is against the bastards . " At a time when the world population still had not reached 3 billion- today it is 6.7 billion- Vogt thought " drastic measures are inescapable . " He warned of " mounting population pressures in the Soviet Union , " where , by the century 's end , " there may be 300 million Russians . " It was time for them " to begin control of one of the most powerful causes of war- overpopulation . " Note : the population of Russia by 2000 was 145 million ; today it is 141 million . ( Fertility rate : 1.4 . ) Population alarmists have long enjoyed the freedom to project their fears onto whatever cause is uppermost in the progressive mind . Then it was war . Today it is the environment , which , we are told , human beings are ruining . This will be shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before our environmental scares have done much harm to a fragile economy ( at the rate things are going with Obama ) . All previous scares were based on faulty premises , and the latest one , based on " science , " will be no different . I believe that two interacting factors shape population growth or decline : economic prosperity and belief in God . As to the first , there is no doubt that rising material prosperity discourages additional I children . Fewer infants die ; large families are no longer needed to support older parents . The welfare state- which only rich countries can afford- has greatly compounded this effect . When people believe that the government will take care of them , pay their pensions and treat their maladies , children do seem less essential . A rise in prosperity also encourages people to think that they can dispense with God . Religion diminishes when wealth increases- that 's my theory . But with a twist that I shall come to . Wealth generates independence , including independence from God , or ( if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed not to exist . This will tend to drive childbearing down even further . Hedonism will become predominant . Remember , Jesus warned that it 's the rich , not the poor , who are at spiritual hazard . The legalization of abortion reflected the decline of religious faith in America , but it must also have led others to conclude that God was no longer to be feared . That 's why I do n't quite believe Djerassi when he tries to disassociate the pill from fertility . The ready availability of the pill told society at large that sex without consequences was perfectly acceptable . Then , by degrees , that self-indulgent view became an anti-natalist worldview . It became so ingrained that many people now think it obvious . Sex became a " free " pastime as long as it was restricted to consenting adults . Furthermore , anyone who questioned that premise risked denunciation as a bigot . THE U.S. HAS BEEN SEEN AS the great stumbling block to any theory linking prosperity , lack of faith , and low fertility . Prosperity here has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am wary of this version of American exceptionalism . How much lower would U.S. fertility fall without the influx of Latino immigrants and their many offspring ? Nicholas Eberstadt , a demographer at AEI , tells me that Mexican immigrants now actually have a higher fertility rate in the U.S. than they do in Mexico . ( Maybe because they come to American hospitals for free medical care ? ) I wonder also if religious vitality here is what it 's cracked up to be . Surely it has weakened considerably . A recent survey by Trinity College in Hartford , funded by the Lilly Endowment , showed that the percentage of Americans identifying themselves as Christian dropped to 76 percent from 86 percent in 1990 ; those with " no " religion , 8.2 percent of the population in 1990 , are now 15 percent . As a social force , the U.S. Catholic bishops have withered away to a shocking extent . Hollywood once respected and feared their opinion . Today , the most highly placed of these bishops are unwilling to publicly rebuke pro-abortion politicians who call themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public . How the mitered have fallen . They dare n't challenge the rich and powerful . But there is another factor . Calling yourself a Christian when the pollster phones imposes no cost and self-reported piety may well be inflated . We have to distinguish between mere self-labelers and actual churchgoers . And beyond that there are groups with intense religious belief who retain the morale to ignore the surrounding materialism and keep on having children . The ultra-Orthodox in Israel are the best example . Other Jewish congregations may go to synagogue , but they have children at perhaps one-third the ultraOrthodox rate . At about seven or eight children per family , theirs is one of the highest fertility rates in the world . And they do n't permit birth controlCarl Djerassi , please note . In the U.S. Orthodox Jews again far outbreed their more secular sisters . The Mormons are also distinctive . Utah , about two-thirds Mormon , has the highest fertility rate ( 2.63 in 2006 ) among the 50 states ; Vermont has the lowest ( 1.69 ) . In the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least religious section of the country . " Vermont is the least religious state ; 34 percent of residents say they have " no religion . " So minimal faith and low fertility are demonstrably linked . Mormon fertility is declining , to be sure , and I recognize that I am flirting with a circular argument : deciding which groups are the most fervent by looking at their birth rates . Then there 's the Muslim concern . It 's hard to avoid concluding that the lost Christian zeal has been appropriated by Islam . In the U.S. , Muslims have doubled since 1990 ( from a low base , to 0.6% of the population ) . The rise of Islam suggests that the meager European fertility rates would be even lower if Muslims had not contributed disproportionately to European childbearing . It 's hard to pin down the numbers , though . Fertility in France has risen , but Nick Eberstadt tells me that the French government wo n't reveal how many of these babies are born to Muslim parents . " They treat it as a state secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland , where lots of guest workers are employed , the fertility rate would be much lower than it already is ( 1.44 ) were it not for the numerous offspring of those guest workers . When a population is not replacing itself , the welfare state creates its own hazard . Lots of new workers are needed to support the retirees . Germany 's low fertility will require an annual immigration of 200,000 just to maintain the current population . Where will they come from ? Many arrive from Turkey , where the fertility rate has also declined ( to about 2.0 ) . But not as far as it has declined among native Germans . So the concern is that in the welfare states of Europe , believing Muslims are slowly replacing the low-morale , lowfertility , materialistic non-believers who once formed a Christian majority . I could summarize the argument with this overstatement : The intelligentsia stopped believing in God in the 19th century . In the 20th it tried to build a new society , man without God . It failed . Then came a new twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a mere polluter- a blot on the landscape . Theologians tell us that creatures can not exist without the support of God . A corollary may be that societies can not long endure without being sustained by a belief in God .
