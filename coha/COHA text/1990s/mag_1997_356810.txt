RUPERT MURDOCH PLAYS HARDBALL Australian Rupert Murdoch has made a habit of buying broadcast rights to North American sports at staggering prices . Now he 's close to buying his own team  --  the L.A. Dodgers baseball club  --  for a major league cost of $350 million . The franchise was recently valued at $147 million . No wonder Dodgers owner Pete O'Malley declared himself " pleased " that the negotiations were winding up . As usual , the tabloid and TV billionaire was willing to fork over what seems an un-economic sum , because his vision goes far beyond Dodger Stadium in Chavez Ravine . Murdoch called the Dodgers " a great American institution . " Great American programming is more like it . Do n't be surprised if the team shows up on News Corp . ' s satellite TV in Japan  --  home to Dodger star pitcher Hideo Nomo  --  and elsewhere . <P> MARVEL 'S TANGLED WEB OF OWNERS <P> Both Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk showed up at a Los Angeles press conference to announce the opening of Marvel Mania , a theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planet Hollywood . But Marvel executives were scarce , perhaps because 2,400 miles to the east a federal judge was handing the bankrupt comic-book company over to new owners . It was the latest blow in the battle for Marvel between Carl Icahn and controlling shareholder Ronald Perelman , two corporate raiders who fight like the company 's fierce X-Men . A federal judge , backing Icahn , said bondholders could seize control of the Marvel board . Perelman can appeal . Marvel managers are no doubt telling their assistants , " If my boss calls , get his name . " <P> BARBIE 'S BAD HAIR DAY HAS COLLECTORS SEEING PINK <P> When it comes to Barbie dolls , many grownups do n't play around . In the collectors ' market for Mattel 's most famous toy , a 38-year-old mint-condition Barbie can go for $5,000 . That 's why a perceived quality problem with some newer products has Barbie buffs seeing red  --  or actually pink , the doll 's signature color . One group has organized a Pink Anger campaign to protest items such as the Poodle Parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Barbie 's cousin , Francie , whose undersize shoes allegedly split when placed on her feet . Poodle Parade Barbie is a remake of a 1965 model , a copper-brown-haired doll with an imaginary black poodle . Really . These are limited-edition dolls , some of which can retail for as much as $900  --  and they can quickly go higher in private trading after store supplies are exhausted . The collectors are also peeved because Mattel has sued an independent enthusiasts ' magazine called MILLER ' $ for trademark infringement . Mattel 's detractors allege the company is using the lawsuit to gain leverage over the magazine 's content . <P> Mattel has promised to address the collectors ' concerns . No sense letting a bad haircut jeopardize a business that brings in $1.7 billion a year from kids of all ages . <P> A PINT OF GUINNESS WITH THAT WHOPPER ?
