<p> O.J. Simpson 's defense in his murder trial will probably cost him $ 3 million for a stable of $ 300- per-hour lawyers , DNA specialists , courtroom experts and investigators , according to legal observers . <p> Not to be outdone , Los Angeles prosecutors are expected to spend $ 2 million in their bid to convict the Hall of Fame running back of murdering his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Goldman . <p> By the time the final costs are counted , the Simpson case will " probably be one of the most expensive murder cases that a defendant has ever paid for , " said one experienced trial lawyer . <p> A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles courts , Jerrianne Hayslett , defended the high price tag and special attention the case has commanded . She insisted that the Simpson proceedings have not disrupted other business in the criminal courts . " All the other cases are right on track , as they would have been had this case not come along . " <p> Simpson 's heavy spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs generally run between $ 25,000 and $ 200,000 , depending on the length of the trial and the difficulty of the case . But the Simpson case will easily break the multimillion-dollar barrier because the celebrity defendant can afford it . <p> " This is what it costs to try a case like this , providing quality lawyers on both sides , " said Elisabeth Semel , a San Diego trial lawyer . <p> According to court documents , Simpson has $ 11.4 million in assets , most of it in real estate , including his $ 5 million Brentwood mansion , a $ 1.9 million summer home in Laguna Beach and an apartment in New York . The judge in the Simpsons ' 1992 divorce estimated that he had an annual gross income of $ 1.1 million . <p> Last month , Simpson began cashing in those assets , when he sold 10,000 shares of stock he held as a director of Cyrk Inc. , a sports equipment firm , to raise $ 150,000 . <p> The sensational legal drama is far from the most expensive criminal case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but legal experts say the number of high-priced attorneys hired by Simpson is astonishing . <p> Most murder suspects can not afford to hire a private lawyer and must rely on one or two lawyers appointed by the court or from the public defender 's office . Lawyers in murder cases typically receive $ 75 to $ 100 an hour . <p> Simpson , however , has at least seven prominent lawyers who charge top dollar for their services . Although there are no figures available , legal experts estimate that his biggest cost will be for his entourage of attorneys , fees that will easily exceed $ 1 million . <p> In criminal cases , lawyers are usually paid a flat fee up front . But several attorneys say that Simpson 's two lead attorneys , Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran , are probably being paid close to $ 300 an hour because they do not want to lock themselves into a set fee . <p> " With somebody with money , the sky 's the limit , " said Michael Burt , a San Francisco deputy public defender who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to keep the money flowing as much as possible . " <p> Defense lawyers deny that Simpson is being overcharged because of his wealth , noting that many attorneys would jump at the chance to try the most publicized murder case in modern history . <p> " When the stakes are high , it 's very , very expensive to provide a thorough , careful aggressive defense that a lot of other people are not getting , " said Semel . <p> Attorneys in other high-profile criminal cases have received six- figure salaries but for longer stretches of service . <p> Leslie Abramson said she was paid $ 650,000 for four years of work on behalf of Erik Menendez , who was tried with his brother , Lyle , for the murders of their parents at their Beverly Hills home . The first trial of both brothers ended in a deadlock , and the district attorney will retry them . <p> Los Angeles defense lawyer Harland Braun received $ 600,000 for representing one of the defendants in the " Twilight Zone " manslaughter case in which actor Vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . The case ran from 1982 through 1987 and included a 10-month trial . <p> With blood evidence expected to play a major role , experts on the use of DNA matching methods will be crucial . Simpson has hired two of the nation 's leading opponents of DNA testing , New York lawyers Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck , who have attacked laboratory methods linking suspects to blood at a crime scene . <p> A major cost will be the academic experts who will testify  --  statisticians , chemists and molecular biologists from top universities . <p> Peter Keane , a San Francisco public defender who has tried many cases involving DNA , estimated that these experts can cost as much as $ 2,500 for a day 's worth of testimony . <p> Including costs for air fare , hotel and meals , Keane predicts that the monthlong hearing on whether to admit the critical DNA tests could cost as much as $ 700,000 . <p> " That 's why this guy is going to run out of money at the end of this trial , " Keane said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense team  --  including criminologists and even a wardrobe consultant , according to news reports . <p> Simpson also has hired a jury consultant , which could cost up to $ 50,000 . He is probably paying another $ 50,000 for investigators , who typically charge $ 25 to $ 100 an hour . <p> Despite the long list of expenses , trial lawyers say that every penny he spends will be worth it if Simpson is found not guilty . <p> " All the money in the world is not going to do him any good in prison , " said San Francisco deputy public defender Burt . " He 's looking at no hope if he goes down for a life without possibility of parole . If it was my money , I would be spending every penny I had to try to get out from under that .
