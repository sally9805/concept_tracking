<p> Sure , he wants an answer . Dave Wannstedt has a wife who aches every Sunday , daughters who ca n't attend games because of fan abuse and assistants with families to support . As soon as possible , he 'd like to know if he 'll be returning to coach the Bears next season , an assurance he says he has n't received from his boss . <p> " We 're kind of at a crossroads here , " he admits for the first time . " That 's going to be a call with our owner . We ca n't hide the issue of what we have to go through to get this thing built up , and he 's going to have to make a decision if he believes I 'm the man to lead that charge or not . " <p> You read that right . Already in his third rebuilding phase , Wannstedt is announcing the absurd necessity of a fourth . With his drafting results , do you want him anywhere near a war room holding the first or second pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want him lending tips to new personnel man Mark Hatley ? <p> " We 've got some players who have gotten old that we have to replace , and there 's other things that have n't worked out , " Wannstedt said . " In the NFL , that usually happens in your first or second year . I 'm in my fifth year and we 're going through some of that , and that 's where the impatience of the fans comes in and the media . " <p> Impatience ? Try outrage . If it were my decision , Wannstedt would be on his way . But the call belongs to Mike McCaskey , who says the simplest way for Wannstedt to secure his future is by not letting the Bears quit during the dog days of one of their most miserable seasons ever . On the 10th week , unlike the ninth and many others , they did not quit . Thanks largely to a stirring halftime speech by the beleaguered coach , the Bears dominated much of the second half Sunday and nearly beat one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Comebacks are rare at the Metrodome , where eardrums are routinely punctured and a barbaric mascot entertained the northlanders by wiping a Bears cap under his armpits , then spitting on it . <p> Through the din , Knute Wannie managed at least a brief inspirational surge . " He questioned our fight , questioned our heart , " said Todd Burger , the feisty guard who is let out of a cage every seventh day . " If nothing else , we answered him . If you do n't have a fight , sell one . " <p> Said Wannstedt , proud and diligent to the end : " You 're never prepared for the adversity we are going through , but we have to deal with it . You ca n't go around this adversity . You have to go through it . That 's what I plan to do , sticking to what I believe in . The worse thing you do when you hit adversity is to all of a sudden compromise something or waver on what you know is right . If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the armor . You ca n't let that happen as a head coach . " <p> Even Erik Kramer , who continued to play well when he should n't be playing at all , adopted the rah-rah stance . " I look at it like the movie ' Braveheart , ' " he said . " We have all the odds against us and every week we have to show up and pick a fight . No one 's going to shudder when we enter the building , so we have to come in and bloody their nose from start to finish . We 've got to prove we 're worth being respected . " <p> So let me get this straight . We should be happy about heart , soul and effort after a close loss , crushing as it was . <p> Whoop-de-doo . <p> Reasonably now , consider this issue as a Bears fan : Should the hollow , nominal matter of keeping games competitive be sufficient reason to feel cheery , much less retain Wannstedt at season 's end ? Last we looked , the standings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wins and losses and ties . Impressive as their rally was , do not lose sight of the agony . The Bears lost again , to drop to 1-9 , and did so in a way where you 'd prefer they were annihilated . I swear , 73-0 would be easier to swallow than 29-22 in the final minute . <p> The pattern has become so methodical , so predictable , the Bears seem to exist for the express purpose of manufacturing defeat . Put them on the stock exchange and call them Failure , Inc . Why return from a 21-10 deficit and take a one-point lead , only to leave just enough time at the end for the Vikings to mow downfield and win ? Whatever heart the Bears showed was left in a million pieces on , yep , Chicago Avenue , leaving us to ponder the guttural truth about the Wannstedt Bears : They are habitual losers . <p> Fortunately , some players are n't delighted with the concept . Each week , a piece of them is dying . " This is right on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We get so close , then we let it go . We had so many expectations this year . Where have they gone ? " <p> " It 's definitely getting a lot tougher to deal with every week . It 's kind of ridiculous , embarrassing , " said Bryan Cox , who again talked of soothing himself with alcohol , this time a bottle of Jack Daniels . " You play football for self-pride , because you want to compete and you think you 're better than the guy across from you . The way we 've been getting beat , I do n't feel that way . It 's getting redundant , over and over and over . I 'm tired of the same excuses , tired of explaining it . " <p> And we 're tired of watching it . How beautiful if the season could end now , everyone would go home and we would fast-forward to next April , where Paul Tagliabue stands on his podium and says , " The Chicago Bears , with the No. 1 pick , select Peyton Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A city has to suffer six more weeks . <p> In that time , questions will be answered about who wants to be here next year and who does n't . The symbolic problem child , of course , is Alonzo Spellman , who looks like he 's taking the year off for his $ 3 million . After the loss , the message from various team leaders was simple : Anyone who acts like ' Zo can go . One person who cares , maybe too much , is defensive end Mark Thomas , who fought with officials  --  is everyone a Cox wannabe ?  --  and then bawled his eyes out in the tunnel afterward . Others do n't care half as much . <p> " We 're gon na figure out who wants to play and who does n't want to play , who wants to be here and who does n't , " Cox said . <p> " The way I look at it , we 're in a weeding-out process , " Kramer said . <p> The quarterback knows he 's in the thick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate , not with the uncertainty of Rick Mirer and the possible arrival of Manning . Still , is n't it time to sit Kramer and see if Steve Stenstrom can play , or even Mirer ? <p> To sum up , the Bears played not to lose Sunday and lost anyway . Early in the third quarter , they had third-and-six at the Minnesota 8 but threw a short pass to Ryan Wetnight and settled for a field goal . In the second quarter , they unraveled when a player called a timeout as Minnesota lined up for a 50-yard field goal , which allowed the Vikings to change thinking , make a fourth-down conversion and score a touchdown  --  at least a four-point swing . And how about this classic : On first down at the Minnesota 15 , the Bears were called for one delay-of-game penalty , had to call a timeout to prevent another and settled for ( gasp ) another field goal . <p> That 's bad preparation , bad execution , bad coaching . <p> Same old story .
