Astride the Wind <p> Ben Balsley 's training as an atmospheric scientist did n't prepare him for wading through shark-infested waters , nor did it train him to fly world-record kites . But two years ago , he found himself doing both as part of an unusual experiment on Christmas Island , in the middle of the Pacific Ocean . <p> Balsley and his cohorts had traveled to this distant atoll in an attempt to reunite two former partners who separated over half a century ago : kites and meteorology . <p> Although kites have dropped out of favor as research tools , Balsley proposes that new designs made from space-age materials could rise to unprecedented heights and remain there for weeks on end  --  soaring platforms that could prove an invaluable means of studying global warming , ozone destruction and a host of other atmospheric concerns . " This is probably the most exciting thing I 've ever been involved with , " says Balsley , who specializes in wind speed studies at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent his kite up into a thunderstorm in a flashy experiment that still burns bright in the memory of schoolchildren . While not the first to use kites in the service of meteorology , Benjamin Franklin captured widespread public attention with his shocking exploits . After the invention of the box design in 1893 , the U.S. Weather Bureau adopted kites as a meteorological tool , flying them from a network of stations for the next 30 years . But with improvements in scientific balloons and the growing importance of airplanes , the popularity of research kites plummeted in the years following World War I. In 1933 , the Weather Bureau finally closed its last station dedicated to this task . In recent decades , kites have served in a mere handful of atmospheric experiments . <p> Balsley 's thoughts first turned to kites a few years ago , during a casual conversation with a colleague who studies the Earth 's electric field . Lamenting the limitations of current techniques , this researcher wondered how he might monitor the field in a spot high above Earth over a period of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he suggested that a kite might solve the problem . <p> In 1990 , Balsley received a small grant from the National Science Foundation to test the idea . A search around the country put him in touch with G. William Tyrrell Jr. , of Doylestown , Pa. , who specializes in designing kites for unusual projects . Tyrrell holds several world records for large kites and kites that lift the most weight . In the past , he has produced designs for filmmaker Woody Allen , the Rolling Stones and even a Japanese fishing fleet that wanted underwater kite-like lures to catch tuna without killing dolphins . <p> Tyrrell recognized the need for a third person : someone with aerodynamic expertise who could help develop a kite capable of riding the thin air at high altitudes . While visiting his seamstress , Tyrrell ran into her husband , Joseph Williams , a former Air Force pilot working as an aeronautical engineer for Modelsym , Inc. , in Doylestown . Williams specialized in designing the wings of lowspeed planes , which bear more than a passing resemblance to kites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For the initial experiment , Balsley asked Tyrrell and Williams to fashion a form that could lift a package of scientific instruments 3 kilometers above the ground in light winds . This altitude is far beyond the range of the average kite . <p> Balsley chose Christmas Island in the Republic of Kiribati because it lies in the equatorial belt where rains are rare and the wind is steady . Aside from providing a flat , nearly treeless expanse , the 40-kilometer-long atoll offered one other important advantage : It hosted only one airplane each week , on Wednesday . The rest of the week , the skies remained free of traffic . <p> Before traveling to Christmas Island , Tyrrell and Williams had to find the right design . Williams created a computer program to analyze the various characteristics of kite flight , including cable weight , cable strength , drag and airfoil shape . The program indicated that only one particular design  --  a parafoil  --  could do the job . <p> Made entirely out of fabric , without any hard frame , parafoils are a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , the tubes inflate and take on a curved shape similar to the camber of an airplane wing . This shape makes air flowing above the kite move faster than the air below the kite , providing the lift that carries the parafoil into the sky . <p> Instead of building one large kite that might rip if the winds grew abnormally strong , Tyrrell decided to construct four that could fly in different combinations to suit the weather conditions . To carry the requisite scientific payload , the kites would have to be quite light , tipping the scales at no more than 2.25 kilograms each . <p> Tyrrell selected a thin ripstop nylon for the kite fabric and a 6-kilometer-long tether made out of kevlar , an extremely strong , lightweight material used for bullet-proof vests . Each kite had a surface area of 12.5 square meters , or roughly the size of two compact cars parked side by side . <p> When they reached Christmas Island  --  so named because of its discovery on Dec. 24 , 1777 , by Capt . James Cook  --  Tyrrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , headed to an abandoned runway at the atoll 's southeast end . The airstrip provided a long , flat surface ideal for preparing the launch . But under the blazing equatorial sun , the pavement heated the air to 43 degrees C ( 110 degrees F ) , generating strong thermal updrafts that confounded efforts to fly the parafoils . <p> A kite caught in a thermal updraft can move forward until it sits overhead with its line perpendicular to the ground  --  an extremely unstable position . " The kite will then go past 90 degrees and start wandering , and usually it comes screaming into the ground nose first , " explains Tyrrell . He and his colleagues finally conquered the thermals by hanging a windsock on the tail end of the kite to shift weight backward , enabling the kite to rise safely above the updrafts . <p> The winds above Christmas Island blew stronger than expected , and the team needed only two of the parafoils to lift the scientific instruments . They put up the first of the red and blue kites , then attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the first . <p> Balsley , who had worked on the island previously , promised his co-workers it would n't rain . But soon after the test flight began , an errant storm suddenly appeared . The rain soaked the lower parafoil , adding enough weight to send it diving into the ocean , where it ripped on a coral reef . When the two Balsleys and Williams waded through the surf to retrieve the kite , they ran into a 2-meter-long shark prowling the area . Both people and shark survived the encounter , and the team went back to replace the torn kite . <p> With two kites flying , the line held seven identical instrument packages spaced 300 meters apart . Each package measured air pressure , temperature , humidity and the electric field , sending the information down via radio to a laptop computer on the ground . By the time the team had let out all the available tether , the kites had reached an altitude of 3.5 kilometers , the highest ever achieved by a parafoil , says Tyrrell . The group had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We would come out in the morning and that kevlar line went up into a clear blue sky It just disappeared . And when you pulled on it , it was alive , " says Balsley , describing the thrill of keeping the kites aloft for so long . <p> For the future , Balsley set their sights even higher . Extrapolating from their test flights and from computer analyses , Williams calculates that a larger parafoil design could carry scientific payloads to an altitude of 19 kilometers in locations with the right wind . That accomplishment would double the highest official altitude record for kites , set in 1919 by a string of eight box kites that reached 9,740 meters . <p> Depending on where it flies , the parafoil design could reach up into the stratosphere , home of the endangered ozone layer . This high-flying kite would measure about 10 times the size of the ones used on Christmas Island . For scale , imagine three tractor-trailers parked side by side . <p> To construct the large parafoil , the group plans to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absorbs less moisture than nylon . Mylar also stands up better to damaging ultraviolet radiation . The kites will need that protection because they could remain aloft for weeks , if not longer . " If we can get them up into the lower stratosphere , there 's no reason they should not stay up for months ' Balsley says . <p> While that feat would certainly shatter some record , Balsley has other aims . He sees high-altitude kites as potentially filling a major gap in atmospheric studies . Scientists have limited means for probing regions more than 15 kilometers high . Currently , only one type of research plane  --  the ER-2  --  can readily perform missions above that altitude , and NASA has only three of these planes available for atmospheric research . The ER-2 has proved invaluable to researchers in the past , but it is extremely expensive to operate  --  dangerous too . If the plane 's single engine quit in a remote area , such as over the ocean near Antarctica , its pilot would probably die . Also , NASA restricts ER-2 flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing dangerously fatigued . <p> Balloons play a major role in atmospheric science , but they , too , have limitations . Normal research balloons rise quickly , limiting the time that instruments can collect measurements in any one layer of the atmosphere . Other balloons are designed to fly at a relatively constant height , but these travel with the wind , not necessarily in the direction scientists want them to head . <p> Unmanned robot planes will soon provide a way of carrying instruments even higher than the ER-2 , and for a fraction of the cost ( SN : 3/2/91 , p. 136 ) . NASA last year funded the construction of three small robot planes , which are expected to roll off the assembly line next year . But even with their relatively inexpensive price tag , the bill for such planes will run into the millions , and current designs can not stay aloft for weeks on end . <p> In contrast , instruments carried by kites could collect long-term measurements in upper regions of the atmosphere . Balsley envisions instruments with special adaptations for extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's energy to power their sensors and radio transmitters . Others might include a wind generator . Still others could use tiny motors to ride up and down the kite tether , collecting data at different levels in the atmosphere . <p> Ron Taylor , program director for physical meteorology at the National Science Foundation , agrees that high-altitude kites could prove quite useful . For example , he says , they could answer some long-standing questions about clouds , which scientists regard as a major impediment to their efforts to predict how much the climate will warm in the future . <p> High cirrus clouds apparently help warm the Earth , and climate experts want to know whether a greenhouse warming will suppress or enhance cirrus development . But atmospheric researchers know relatively little about the ice crystals that form these thin , wispy clouds . " That 's the big mystery about cirrus clouds . We just do n't have enough information to say whether there are little crystals , big ones or all kinds . We do n't have many aircraft available for meteorological research that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While kites can potentially fill a meteorological niche , they have their own limitations . The high-altitude designs require a steady , moderate breeze and can not fly in places where the wind is too light or too variable , as it often is in the mid-latitudes of the globe , says Balsley . He expects the high-flying kites would find their greatest use in the equatorial belt or closer to the poles , at least in the beginning . <p> Getting away from the populated midlatitudes would also keep the kites out of the major air traffic corridors , thereby circumventing another major restriction . Researchers can not simply float a kite high in the atmosphere anywhere they wish : In the United States , Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit flying kites that weigh more than 5 pounds above modest altitudes . <p> Balsley says these restrictions need not ground the kites entirely in populated regions . Meteorologists may be able to apply for special permits , something Balsley did when his group test flew the parafoils on Hawaii 's big island . " This does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For now , funding presents the biggest hurdle . The Christmas Island crew is awaiting NSF 's reaction to their $1.4 million proposal for building and testing several of the larger , high-altitude kites over a four-year period . Taylor says the answer should come within the next few months . <p> In an era of increasingly complex and problem-prone aviation technology , perhaps funding officials will find some appeal in reviving one of meteorology 's simpler tools . <p> PHOTO : During a test flight on Hawaii , the parafoil displays its curved top , which generates lift as air rushes over it .
