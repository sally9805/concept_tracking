Section : POINT/COUNTERPOINT A CHALLENGE BEING MET <p> The rapid growth of the proprietary health care sector in recent years has brought challenges to hospital social work as well as opportunities for social work to expand into new programs and roles . All hospitals face the challenge of balancing cost-cutting with the delivery of quality social work services within the time constraints stipulated by Medicare 's diagnostic related groups ( DRGs ) . The expansion of hospitals beyond acute care presents opportunities in home health care services , outpatient services , a wide range of specialty programs , and services specifically for the elderly . In all these new areas , commitment to high-quality patient care can be maintained . <p> The variables that directly affect the quality of the social work services performed in for-profit settings relate to staff and to factors in specific cases . These variables are found in all hospitals ; they require that hospital social workers clearly define their intent and work closely with other disciplines if social work standards are to be maintained . But the widespread view that for-profit hospitals tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to discharge patients earlier , often at the expense of social work standards , is mistaken . <p> Under the nation 's current DRG policy , payment for hospital care is reimbursed according to the patient 's diagnosis rather than the length of stay . Effective , creative , and timely discharge plans thus play a key role in the hospital 's financial success . Hospital social workers need highly developed , sophisticated clinical skills to help patient/clients  --  within an extraordinarily short period of time  --  resolve psychosocial dilemmas or learn to manage their lives after discharge under vastly changed circumstances . Thus , to ensure both the continuity of care for the patient/client from preadmission to return home ( or its equivalent ) and financial viability for the hospital , social workers in all hospitals must focus on discharge planning . <p> Social workers are expected to direct the discharge planning process and to involve other disciplines in the process . To this end , the Hospital Corporation of America ( HCA ) has developed a contractual adjustment team to promote quality patient care and achieve financial benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient from preadmission through account collection from Medicare . For example , Johnston-Willis Hospital , an HCA hospital in Richmond , Virginia , holds formal weekly discharge-planning meetings with representatives from administration , fiscal services , utilization review , quality assurance , social work , nursing , and medical records . One purpose of these meetings is to find solutions to difficult discharge-planning cases , for example , the purchase or rental of a ventilator for a nursing home that is receiving a ventilator-dependent patient . <p> Screening before and at admission expedites social work services . The information obtained promotes a coordinated approach to effective intervention during the patient 's stay and a smooth transition at discharge . <p> The first key to maintaining social work standards in for-profit hospitals is to screen early , involve as many disciplines as appropriate , and provide aggressively the most complete range of clinical social work services possible . This goal is supported by the standards of the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals and Organizations ( JCAHO ) : readily available social work services that are organized and properly directed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate documentation ; and involvement in quality assurance . <p> The second key is for the social work department to grow as its organizational and corporate environment grows . A dominant trend that will likely intensify in the future of the hospital industry is expansion into new areas of service , such as outpatient services , home health care , and residential services for the elderly . Just as the advent of DRGs increased the visibility of social work in hospitals , the social work department that demonstrates skill in efficient program planning for special populations increases its visibility and value to the organization . Thus , the social work staff at Johnston-Willis Hospital is involved in program development and employee support as well as clinical services . The staff consistently maintains the highest standards for social work practice and never loses sight of clients ' needs . <p> The hospital that survives and thrives in the future will be far different from the hospital of the past . It will focus on early diagnosis and the management of chronic illness and conditions . The hospital of the future will reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and in residential communities as much as it will depend on the sick to cross its threshold for help ( Goldsmith , 1989 ) . Within this changing environment , social work standards in for-profit health care will be maintained so long as social workers take their place as professional partners in hospitals and health care programs . MELANIE HUMPHREYS , MSW Director of Social Services Johnston-Willis Hospital 1401 Johnston-Willis Drive Richmond , VA 23235-4789 <p> REASONS FOR DOUBT <p> The conclusion to the argument set forth below is that given the overall circumstances under which medical care is rendered in the United States , the practice of social work in for-profit health settings is likely to face serious questions about the adequacy of its standards . <p> Until well into the twentieth century , science had relatively little influence in the operation of the healing and organizational processes dominant in American medical care . The mutual influences of medical education , research , and technologically advanced treatment are inventions of the century about to conclude . Parallel to these developments , but not nearly as dramatic in its evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its role was to express compassion and the impulse to do good  --  supposedly central dynamics in nearly all human service professions . The mechanism for the fullest expression of these qualities was the hospital . <p> In the 1930s , serious questions arose over the depth of the commitment of medicine to social welfare when the American Medical Association defeated the attempt to include a national health system in the Social Security Act . More than 50 years after that defeat , American medical care , which is selectively capable of the most superb interventions but increasingly controlled by for profit corporations , has become the center of a storm over rights and obligations that touches all segments of American society , particularly patients  --  both actual and potential . Social work is no exception . Medicine as a profession , the investor-owners of corporate medical settings , and an ever-increasing number of corporate managers of these settings all have their special agendas in this controversy . Social work , as a component of American health and medical care , has its own agenda as well . The question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under what conditions . <p> The argument is as follows . If the role of social work in American health care was assessed on the basis of technical prowess alone , there would be not only reason for hope for the future but also satisfaction with how social workers function with their health care clients in large city hospitals , state hospitals , outpatient clinics in university hospitals , and elsewhere . This would be so even though health social workers often provide services under conditions that frequently border on the impossible . Many social workers , for example , carry on despite being overworked , underpaid , and too often treated with disrespect . <p> In addition to these problems , hospitals and like settings are themselves unstable . During the 1980s , an increasing number of health settings have become investor-owned and , as a result , financial interests ( profits ) by definition precede other concerns . This lack of stability affects the social worker 's ability to provide services that meet professional expectations and standards . In such settings , services offered are frequently changed , eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Not all hospitals , by any means , serve the poor . Many serve only middle- and upper-class clients . Where does this leave social work ? <p> It is altogether fair to describe some of the major trends in the profession 's stance toward poor members of society in the same terms used to describe urban redevelopment . Social work practice in profit-making health settings is in the midst of gentrification . One detects signs of gentrification everywhere . Although licensing and advanced credentialing clearly have some relationship to service quality , far too often the social workers who pursue them are motivated by the wish to become independent practitioners who are eligible for third-party reimbursement . One can see this trend among students admitted to schools of social work who seek " training for psychotherapy " rather than " education for social work . " The signs of this trend are everywhere  --  among social work practitioners , in the ads published in social work periodicals that offer advanced training in psychotherapy , and in articles and reports about the advantages of private practice supported by third-party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles describe practice in terms more appropriate to a real estate developer than to a social worker  --  for example , " technically sophisticated products offered for a fee by social workers in clean , modern , physician-like surroundings . " <p> Professionally , there is an observable trend in social work to move away from the disheveled the dirty , the " concrete service client " and to conceptualize clients as people in need of counseling for psychopathological conditions  --  even when such intervention is clearly inappropriate for the client , as it is for most health care clients , whose reactions to the enormous stress caused by diagnoses of severe illness or injury are perfectly normal . Nowhere is this trend more pronounced than among students who reject careers in health social work because they want to do " clinical social work " and do not want to be " stuck doing only discharge planning "  --  an expression of truly colossal ignorance . The continued reliance among social workers on the individualistic doctrine that each person is responsible to no one but himself or herself , whose responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the heart of the problem . <p> Social work will in time have to make up its mind . Exclusionism , the idea that one serves the wealthy and the middle class , in private practice or in medical settings that are components of investor-owned corporations , will clearly push the profession in one direction . Serving the community through organizations at a negotiated salary will mean something quite different . But should the majority of social workers in health care cling to the doctrine of individual self-determination for themselves as well as for their clients , then the provision of health social work services will become merely another harmless , unremarkable storefront operation in a gentrified neighborhood . It wo n't be illegal  --  but will it be good ? Will we be able to argue truthfully that the compromised good is still competent ? And will we truly be able to claim that professional social work standards are being met ? Although there may be exceptions , positive answers to these questions seem doubtful . HANS S.
