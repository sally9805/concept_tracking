If the Internet lately has seemed more accessible to ordinary mortals , it is largely the result of two inventions : the first is the World Wide Web , an organizing system within the Internet that makes it easy to establish links between computers around the world ; the second is a program called Mosaic , a " browser " that presents the information in the Web in the point-and-click format so familiar to Macintosh and Windows users . <P> What the computer user sees when he fires up Mosaic is a document that looks something like a magazine page . It has nicely formatted text . It has bulleted lists of places and things . It has icons and images . But it also has , hidden within those words and images , links to other locations on the Internet . Certain words on the page are highlighted in blue . When the user clicks on blue words , the program reaches across the Internet , grabs the next page of information  --  wherever it happens to be  --  and displays it on the screen . Click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , you 're in Geneva , Switzerland , where the Web was developed . Click on " California Yellow Pages , " and boom , you 're looking at a list of Bay Area companies . <P> " Mosaic is both the road map and the steering wheel , " says Marc Andreessen , the 23-year-old programmer who co-authored the original version of Mosaic while an undergraduate working at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana . Because the program was developed with government money , the students gave it away free . It soon spread through the network like a virus . A million copies were downloaded from the NCSA computer system in the first year . Another million were distributed in the next six months . Meanwhile , the number of Web " sites " you can visit with Mosaic has exploded , from a few dozen a year ago to more than 10,000 today . You can find everything on the Web from Hubble Space Telescope images to soft-core porn movies to the latest Rolling Stones hit . Even the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Suddenly everybody 's looking for a way to cash in on Mosaic 's popularity , including Andreessen . In April he teamed up with Jim Clark , former chairman of Silicon Graphics , and started a new company called Mosaic Communications . Clark and Andreessen lured all but one of the original Mosaic team to Silicon Valley for some intense programming sessions . Last week they unveiled the first result : called Mosaic NetScape , it is faster and slicker , and it allows users to pass sensitive information such as credit-card numbers safely over the network .
