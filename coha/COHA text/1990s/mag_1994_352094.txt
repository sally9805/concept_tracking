Fame , alas , can insulate a performer from the masses . But nowadays when pop- music stars feel the need to get in touch with the public mood , they have only to log on to the nearest computer bulletin board . Which is precisely what Michael Stipe did a few weeks ago . The lead singer of the rock band R.E.M. , based in Athens , Georgia , spent a few hours online to answer questions from his fans and satisfy his curiosity . " The record 's almost done , and I 'm bored , " he typed . Folks peppered him with queries . What would the group 's highly anticipated new CD sound like ? " Like punk rock , " he replied . " But loud . " <P> R.E.M . ' s new CD , Monster , out next week , does indeed blast with the boldest , brawniest music the band has ever recorded . In an interview with Time , Stipe described the new sound succinctly : " We wanted noise . " Added R.E.M . bassist Mike Mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want to try different things . On past albums we had been exploring acoustic instruments , trying to use the piano and mandolin , and we did it about all we wanted to do it . And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music is about as fun as music can be . " <P> Before MTV became the sugar daddy of rock ' n ' roll , before Pearl Jam 's Eddie Vedder was even out of grade school , before the term alternative rock was trampled into the mud at the overhyped Woodstock ' 94 , there was R.E.M . The , band , formed in 1980 , is known for its artful , challenging music as well as its emotive , elliptical lyrics . Rather than succumbing to common-denominator tastes and releasing music that is too easily accessible , it has followed its own eccentric muse . In doing so , it set a standard for such alternative bands of the ' 90s as Pearl Jam and Offspring . Says Denise Sullivan , author of the book R.E.M .  --  Talk About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , on their own terms , and that 's really rare . " <P> The quartet  --  Stipe , Mills , guitarist Peter Buck and drummer Bill Berry  --  met in Athens in the late ' 70s . It was not altogether friendship at first sight . " We were definitely in different camps in school , " says Berry . " ( ( Mills ) ) was kind of the nerdy , preppie , straight-A student who hung out with the other straight-A students , and I was more the pot-smoking cool dude who hung around with the seedy element . " As a teenager , Stipe wore unstylish corduroy pants with ribs as thick as ropes and drenched his hair with mustard . Despite that  --  or perhaps because of it  --  Buck found Stipe 's " weird " taste in music appealing . All four eventually linked up at a party , discovered they shared musical interests and started a band .
