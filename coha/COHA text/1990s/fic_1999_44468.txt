THE LAD , HIS GREATCOAT drenched , ice clinging to his hair and lashes , brought the cold smell of sleet into the castle hall with him . " I beg hospitality of the laird , if you are he , " the lad said , his voice wee as a bairn 's . <p> Duncan motioned for his manservant to build up the fire . " I 'm Laird Campbell , and do you think I would turn away a stranger ? " <p> The lad nodded , not taking his huge , frightened eyes off Duncan . <p> " Bring hot porridge , whiskey , and a straw tick , " said Duncan to the manservant . Both he and the manservant were muzzy , pulled out of sound sleep by the pounding on the door . " Why are you on the road in such weather ? " <p> " Men track me like an animal , " said the lad . " I 've run these ten miles , and if I go a step further , I shall fall down in the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet clothes , " said Duncan , " and take this plaid to wrap around you . You may sleep before the fire if you wish . " <p> The lad flinched away from Duncan , but surrendered his sodden greatcoat , smelling of wet wool , and took the plaid . The manservant had brought a bowl of oats fragrant with added whiskey , and the lad ate it in neat , quick spoonsful . <p> " Why should they make an outlaw of so young a lad , bonnie as you are ? " <p> " I have gone afoul of a powerful laird . " The lad sank down by the fire and closed his dark eyes . " Laird Duncan , I beg a boon . " <p> " Ask your boon , lad , and I 'll give it . " <p> " Swear to take me under your protection . " <p> " It is sworn , lad . " <p> " By Ben Cruachan , swear . " <p> The mountain ? Ben Cruachan was the sight he saw always from his home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By Ben Cruachan , then , if you must . " <p> The lad pulled the plaid over his shoulders and sank down on the straw tick , turning away from Duncan . <p> Duncan dreamt hideous dreams that night . His cousin Donald , to whose sister Elizabeth he was betrothed , came in the dream and addressed him sternly , saying he had said what he should not have said , and done ill by him who was to be his brother-in-law . Duncan woke in a cold sweat and dozed only fitfully the rest of the night . <p> At dawn , Duncan 's bagpiper- for Duncan kept a piper in defiance of the ban - woke the household with a military air , " Are You Waking Yet , Johnny Cope ? " and then played a sad song , " The Flowers of the Forest Have Faded Away , " which always made Duncan think of his father 's funeral . His father had been dear to him , and he remembered strolling with him during that last spring , plucking sprigs of forget-me-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But the piper 's wail put courage back in Duncan 's heart ; forgetting his ill dreams , he went down to greet his guest . The youth was up and neatly dressed , looking less like a drowned cat than the night before . A comely lad , younger than Duncan himself , whose father 's death had made him laird when he was scarcely a man . The lad 's fresh complexion and dark , flashing eyes pleased Duncan , as did his elegant manners . <p> " What may be your name , that you ask hospitality of the Campbells ? " <p> " I am Angus Stewart . " The lad looked bashfully away . The Stewarts were on ill terms with the Campbells , and Duncan frowned . He immediately regretted taking in this child of discord . <p> But he was a man of honor , and so sent for bannocks and tea with milk before questioning Angus Stewart further . <p> " May I know your crime ? " he asked , as soon as was civil . <p> Angus looked Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair fight . He had insulted my honor . Please - " Angus held up a hand , " remember your pledge . " <p> " You extracted this promise from me by trickery , " said Duncan thoughtfully , " but if your cause was honorable , I am bound by it . " <p> Angus fell to his knees and kissed Duncan 's hand . " I shall do you whatever service you wish , if you will shelter me . " <p> Duncan , come so recently to his title , was embarrassed . Such toadying was unmanly , and if the lad was to stay , he would have to learn better ways . It was unseemly to ask a lad not much younger than he himself to work for his keep , yet noble lads - Duncan felt sure Angus was of noble birth - often did menial , hard labor . <p> " I trust you know horse grooming ? " <p> " My Laird , I would serve you by playing the pipes . " <p> An odd request , but Duncan called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart lad be instructed along with young Andrew , the piper 's son . <p> All day long , as Duncan went over his accounts before the fire , he heard tunes played : " Carls w ' the Breeks , " " The Old Sword 's Lament , " and " The Fried Periwig . " Angus had some knowledge , it seemed , for it was only by listening closely that Duncan could hear when the tune was played by the master , and when by young Angus . <p> Daylight brightened , the storm abated , and a man beat on Duncan 's gate : old Robert Campbell , his uncle who was to be his father-in-law . <p> Robert Campbell strode into the hall and tore off his bonnet . " You harbor one who has spilled blood , Duncan Campbell , and you must give the murderer up . " <p> In the far corner of the castle , Duncan could hear the bagpipe lessons going on : " The Bells of Perth . " The skirl of the practice chanter made the hair of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two strides was at the mantel where his claymore lay . <p> " I have sworn protection to the killer . " <p> Robert put his hand to his own claymore . " Then I fear you 've done unwisely , Duncan , and it shall go ill with you when you come to fetch Elizabeth as your bride . The one you shelter has murdered Donald , your own cousin . " <p> Horror and confusion rose in Duncan 's heart , but he had given his word . He said , " Be that as it is . My word is my bond . " His hand tightened on the claymore . <p> " You will regret that pledge , " said Robert . <p> Duncan stood in the open door and watched Robert mount and ride away in the freezing rain . <p> Duncan 's anger boiled within him . Angus Stewart had made him give his word , after killing his cousin and his friend , the man who was brother to his beloved ! He strode into the chamber where old Andrew instructed the lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , seeking the oath of the cousin of the man you killed ? " he said . <p> " I have done nothing - " <p> Duncan struck the lad on the cheek , knocking him backward into the wall . <p> Young Stewart sank to his knees before Duncan and tore open his shirt . <p> Duncan staggered backward . No flat chest , hairy as a man 's or smooth as a boy 's , was revealed beneath that shirt , but two full , bonny breasts as ripe as September apples . <p> " Do what you will with me , " said the stranger , " but remember your pledge . " <p> Duncan raked a hand through his beard . " What manner of creature are you ? " <p> " I am a lass , " said young Stewart . " My true name is Annie , and I disguised myself in man 's dress . " She fluffed out her dark hair , bit her lips and flushed , and he marveled how he could ever have thought her a lad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling the color creep over his own face . <p> Instead she reached her arms out . " Remember your pledge ! Donald your cousin tried to ravish me , and I defended myself as a good woman ought . I did n't mean to kill him , but my wee knife slipped . " <p> Duncan turned his eyes away , but the lass seized his hands and pressed them to her lips . He could feel the heat of her bosom , smell her skin , and he was moved by dark passions . " This must be a lie , " he said . " Donald was a mild man , married to the bonniest lass in Inverawe save my own beloved . He can not have tried to ravish you . " <p> She sobbed , " I swear to you , by Ben Cruachan , and by St. Andrew . " <p> " You are free with oaths , lass . " Duncan tried halfheartedly to pull his hand away . <p> " See these bruises on my neck and bosom , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Duncan looked , as she opened the shirt further and displayed a few faint marks , one on the base of her throat , and another near her roseblush nipple . He was always a passionate man , and in his anger , the sight stirred him . <p> " Honor your word , " she said in a wee voice . <p> Duncan jerked his hand away . " Stay far from my piper and my other people , " he said . " Robert will be back . I do na doubt that he went to get his other sons . " <p> Then he seized her hand and dragged her back into the hall . There , he called for a servant to make up a bundle of bread , whiskey , and woolen rugs . " I know of a cave where I played when I was a lad , " said Duncan . " Robert will not find you there . " And when she hesitated , " Come . Darkness is falling and the way will be treacherous for the horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan 's fine mare , Annie Stewart riding astride in her lad 's clothes , her arms around Duncan . When Duncan lifted her down in the cold dark , he smelled her hair , fragrant despite her hard dealings . <p> " I shall freeze here , " she said . <p> " Do na think of making a fire , " Duncan said . " I can leave you the one rug . Wrap tight in it and stay deep in the cave . " <p> She held out her arms to him . " Warm me before you go . " <p> Duncan knew well that she was enticing him , this murderer of his bride 's brother , but he went to her , lay on the thick woolen rug with her and wrapped it around them . " You 'll be warm enough with a nip of whiskey , " he said . <p> She held him the tighter , wrapping narrow , strong arms about his waist . She did not seem cold ; indeed her thinly covered bosom pressed against his chest with feverish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You 'll be warm enough till morning . Then you can move around and stir your blood . " <p> She buried her face in the hollow of his neck . Her hair fell silkily across his cheek , and the odor of her sweat stirred him . <p> " Your arms are strong , " she said in a low husky tone . " I wish it had been you instead of Donald . " <p> Despite her wiles , desire rose in him , unquiet and harsh . He asked , " What do you want with me ? " <p> " Swear to protect me , Duncan . Swear by Ben Cruachan , on your dirk . " She reached down and took his dirk from its sheath . The dirk , shaped like Christ 's cross , betokened a man 's honor . Placing it against her bosom , she took his hand and pressed against it . " Swear . " <p> " I 've sworn , " he said . <p> " Again . " <p> " Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and her hands strayed under his kilt like flowers blown against his naked skin . Beyond thinking , he stroked her hips . His hands without his will undid her male disguise and she took him into her . <p> Whether she was maiden or not , Duncan could not tell . She might have been , was his last waking thought . <p> As he slept on the hard , rocky floor of the cave , wrapped with this murderer-lass , a dream came to him . <p> " Duncan , beware ! You lie with a witch , a changeling . " <p> Duncan , in his dream , sat upright and cried , " Donald , cousin ! What do you want of me ? " <p> " Revenge . Take up your dirk and kill the witch . " <p> " Donald , forgive me , but I swore on that very dirk to protect her . " <p> " You have sworn ill , cousin . " And from the face and breast of the apparition streamed blood , spattering Duncan until he woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me . " <p> Annie Stewart opened her eyes sleepily . " Honey-love , what 's wrong ? " Despite his shame his passions rose again and he went into her . <p> Shivering when the cold air hit his sweating body , Duncan went to the mouth of the cave and looked out . First light crept across the valley . His horse he could see dimly in a patch of gorse down the path , where it had sheltered . " I must be gone , " he muttered . <p> From somewhere below came the drone of bagpipes so faint Duncan could scarcely make out the tune : " The Flowers of the Forest . " Seized with fear , he looked over his shoulder . But Annie was still asleep in the darkness . <p> When he looked again into the valley , he thought he saw a man walk up the path . <p> The wail of the bagpipes grew louder as the dark figure loomed nearer . Duncan 's hair stood on end , and he smelled the bitter , bright odor lightning makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Farewell , cousin ! Since you will na revenge my death , I shall see you na more till Ticonderoga . " <p> Duncan fell to his knees on the path , doubled over with horror and guilt . Finally , he felt for his dirk in its sheath , but he had left it beside Annie in the cave . <p> THE NEXT YEAR , Duncan smoothed over his quarrel with Robert by saying that he had cast the murderer out where she was sure to die of cold , and so he was able to marry Donald 's sister Elizabeth . He was perhaps too quick to forgive himself the sin of ill-advised swearing but reasoned that he had been tricked . <p> When his wife asked why he always wanted to roam , to go with the soldiers , he said only that he feared his death at a place called Ticonderoga . Since Donald had spoken of it , it must be a place nearby , so he would rove far . Duncan and Elizabeth had sons , fine military men , and Duncan himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his regiment went , Duncan asked if one had heard this strange name , Ticonderoga , and no one knew even what land it was in , though some avowed it must be an Irish or a Scottish village so far set in the mountains that none had heard of it . <p> When Duncan was a man of forty-five , his Majesty sent the Fortysecond Highlanders to serve under General James Abercromby , to take a colonial fortification , Fort Carillon , from the French . With Duncan went his eldest son and young Albert , the piper whose father had served when Duncan was young . <p> Duncan was used to cold , and rain , and meager rations , but the colonies imposed a different kind of hardship . When the Forty-second landed at Lake George , his brogues , stockings , and legs were covered with mud after only a few paces on the bank . Insects stung him , and in his Black Watch tartan the heat made his skin itch . Instead of the fine vistas of his homeland , there seemed only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassably thick forest . <p> The French who held Fort Carillon under Montcalm were known to be few and poorly provisioned , but the French-allied Natives were fierce fighters who tortured their captives . Their weakness , he understood , was whiskey , and Duncan , like all his men , carried with him a small flask of Scotch whiskey , a possible barter for his life . Duncan had private misgivings about Abercromby , who was never an enterprising commander , and at the moment , he suspected , had the flux from bad water . <p> Fort Carillon , Duncan understood , was a gateway to Lake Champlain and the other freshwater seas that the French held . Abercromby did have the imagination to realize that the thick forest was enemy to those who did not know the land . A magnificent waterfall was near the site of the fort , and yet the thunder of its waters seemed to come from all directions . So Abercromby determined that a small advance force , led by Lord Howe , his charismatic second in command , should scout the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up maps for a plan of battle . <p> Howe 's men stumbled into a French reconnaissance force and defeated it . But Howe , who had always been more popular than Abercromby , was killed , which much demoralized the entire army . <p> Abercromby determined that a smaller force should scout further , and Duncan was to lead this group . <p> So at dawn , Duncan and a group of Forty-second Highlanders , taking with them a bagpiper for communication and morale , set out toward the falls , led by the American colonial scout , Horatio " Polecat " Spotswood . <p> The troop trudged through deep wood and meadow , Polecat pointing out landscape features . Near the falls , they encountered a deep ravine . <p> " By St. Andrew , there must be a clearing beyond , " Duncan announced , " A good place for the French to reconnoiter . " <p> " Tarnation , sir ! There 's foul water and varmints down there ! " Polecat warned . <p> But Duncan crashed through thicket to the bottom , crossed a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He clambered up , hauling himself by vines and roots smelling of crushed leaves , until , near the other side , he had to stop and rest . His hands and knees were raw from the rough bark and stones . The falls thundered nearby , but unseen , and he longed to plunge into cold water , to sooth the rash he had from the three-leaved vines and the insect bites . <p> As he drew breath , he saw a pair of dark , naked legs , only a few feet above him . <p> He raised his gaze to look into the sardonic eyes of a dark Native , who seemed amused by a kilted Scotsman 's Black Watch tartan , sporran , and other regalia . Indeed , Duncan would have been equally amused at the outrageous costume of the painted Native , with its beads , leathers , and feathers , had his position not been so precarious . <p> " Je vais vous crever ! " Duncan yelled , groping for his pistol . It was the direst French threat he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian . Worse luck , the man probably spoke no white man 's language . <p> The Native held up a musket , still with an air of detached amusement . " I speak your language , English man . Your uniform , however , is strange . More beautiful than the French , the English , or any of the colonials . " <p> " I 'm Scots , damn it , " said Duncan , lowering the pistol , but not putting it away . The Indian did not have a red ribbon tied around his musket to signal British alliance , and the weapon itself appeared to be of French issue . " Of the Forty-second Highlanders . " <p> " Tell me why I should not kill you now , " said the Native . <p> Duncan heaved himself up to the level of the Native and looked him in the eye . " I do not fear death today . " <p> " All men die . Perhaps I have your death in my gun here . Or perhaps I shall put you to the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers peel off your scalp , or roast you slowly ? Can you keep silent , grub-colored man ? " <p> Duncan thought he could hear his heart beat , even over the roar of the falls . " I may be mortal , but I shall na die here , lad . A ghost has doomed that I shall die at a place called Ticonderoga . " <p> The enemy laughed , a single barking laugh . " Do you not know the name of this place , Highlander ? " <p> " The name is Fort Carillon , for the sound of the falls , which are called Carillon Falls . " <p> " Listen to the water . " <p> And Duncan listened to the chime-like falls . <p> " My people have a fancy that the falls sing a sound like Ti-con-deroga . " <p> Duncan felt cold wash over his skin as if the falls themselves had drenched him . At the same time , bagpipe music lilted over the ravine , playing " The Flowers of the Forest . " Duncan glanced away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . <p> He shook his head , as if he had seen another ghost . Ticonderoga ! The pipe music stopped , and the piper started another tune , " The Lament for the Only Son . " It was his own piper , playing to lead him back to the scouting party . <p> When Duncan reported to Abercromby , he told the General that there was high ground , called by the colonial American Mount Defiance , and that Abercromby should put his cannon atop it , from whence he could bombard the Fort and force the French to surrender . <p> " No time , no time , " said Abercromby , chewing his thumbnail . " Montcalm has reinforcements of seven thousand men who will join him by nightfall , and with them a huge complement of redskins . " <p> " Begging your pardon , sir , but the Fort will contain na more than four hundred . " <p> " They 'll hold the Heights of Carillon , which is high ground , Major Campbell . " <p> So the cannon sat useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintendent Johnson with his Natives to the top of Mount Defiance . Duncan bowed his head stoically before that stupidity , knowing their muskets did not have the range to discomfit the French . <p> Duncan fell asleep thinking of his homeland , which he knew he would never see again , of the gorse and bracken , the scent of purple heather , of beautiful Ben Cruachan and Inverawe , the lochs and the mountains all soft gray and green , of his sons at home and his son who was with him , and of his sweet Elizabeth . He dreamed that night of a man 's voice , familiar from the shades of time : " Duncan , you may na turn away . Go to your death with honor . " And a woman 's : " Fly , Duncan . There is still time . In the forest your Black Watch tartan will be near invisible and you can after join your comrades and pretend you were in the battle . " <p> " How could I face men who had braved death when I fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth ? " <p> " Ah , Duncan , Duncan ! You could be a landholder here . For women 's company , you could have a Native lass , or I would come to you , not as a wraith , but alive and warm . " <p> Duncan felt himself bum with love for life ; he remembered the scent of every lass he had ever loved . He wanted to live . <p> But he wanted his own wife , his own sons , his own Highland castle , and most of all himself - his honor . <p> He awoke to the certainty of his fate . When the day of the battle dawned , Abercromby ordered his infantry , together with the Forty-second Highlanders , to storm the French defenses . <p> And then it became apparent what defenses the French had created . Montcalm , the French General , had ordered his men to fell trees , top branches sharpened and pointing toward the English enemy . It created an impenetrable thicket of branches and sharpened poles , all pointing outward . This wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a man 's head , and thirty to forty feet in depth . French musketeers could hide in its depths and fire at will , but the British allies would be pierced on the branches , open to enemy fire . Their own bullets would do no good against the wall of branches . <p> When Duncan saw this he knew that he had met his doom . Abercromby was mad to think that anything short of cannon could make a hole in this wall . It was his fate to lead his men against this wall , his deadly fate . <p> The pipers played the tune that called for advance , and Duncan waded into the fray , loading and firing at every glint that might have been a French fleur de lys . Gunsmoke smelled harsh and hot as he fought . When he ran out of balls , he knelt amid the thicket and struck sparks with his flint . He managed to set several fires ; but when he retreated a few paces , French soldiers quenched them with water . <p> Duncan still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a strange freedom . It was as if all the bonds of his nature had been cut loose . He struck at the branches with his sword , making headway toward the enemy . He had almost crawled through the last space into the French defenses when a sharp pain blossomed in his chest . <p> He stumbled a few feet further , then fell , hearing the piper play , " Are You Waking Yet , Johnny Cope ? " A dark shape materialized above him . <p> " Whiskey , " he said , soundlessly , and by some miracle the shape - it was his own son - bent over him and dribbled a few sweet drops on his lips . I will die with my mouth full of Scotland after all , thought Duncan . <p> And then he was in a mist . His son was gone , along with the roar of the battle . And yet he could smell the smoke and the raw , torn wood . A tall man came up on his right side . " Duncan , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you protected the Stewart woman . She was a liar , a witch , and a murderess , but she dazzled you as she did me , and I forgive you . " <p> " Donald , " said Duncan . <p> " Up with you , my kinsman . A short walk , and we can rest forever . " He offered his hand . <p> But there was another shape , too . Breathless , its hair a dark corona , face shadowed by the blaze behind its head , it knelt and put a hand to Duncan 's lips , wiping away the whiskey that had spilled from his mouth . " Duncan , truelove ! I 've come to save you . " <p> " Annie , " said Duncan . He remembered the murderer 's name , Annie Stewart , though he had not thought of her for twenty years . <p> " Let me but kiss your wounds and we will fly from here . I will show you delights that the godly do na dream of . " Duncan could still see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say na more , " said the ghost . " You know what she is . " <p> And Duncan gave her such a look that she stepped back . From his death in a land between Ticonderoga and the afterworld , Duncan looked up at the fair-faced woman and at his cousin . <p> The smell of gunpowder and new-fallen trees had faded , but he heard pipes softly playing " The Flowers of the Forest , " and it seemed that he lay in a bower fragrant with the strange flowers of a new world . He reached out , and his hand clasped a dirk . By the work on its handle he knew it to be the same blade he had sworn upon and left with Annie Stewart in a cave twenty years before . But it was his no longer . It had lain in Annie Stewart 's bosom , and lost all sacred meaning . <p> It was as cold as if it had lain for twenty years beneath the falls of Ticonderoga . <p> He had kept his oath , and Donald had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the dirk . <p> It fell from his fingers and he heard the wind sigh over the heather below Ben Cruachan . He clasped Donald 's hand and rose to walk the mountain of his soul 's home . <p> Author Affiliation
