If debt was the height of fashion during the Roaring Eighties , it has become , just one month into the 1990s , painfully passe . The securities issued by companies that loaded up on leverage to do deals during the ' 80s are now taking their lumps on Wall Street as investors shift their money to less- indebted companies . <P> No securities have been hit harder than junk bonds . The $200 billion market fell 7% in value during the last quarter of 1989 . It suffered another blow last week when the credit-rating agency Moody 's suddenly downgraded some debt issued by RJR Nabisco , which went private in a $25 billion buyout last year . The RJR securities had been viewed as among the most solid junk bonds . But investors were quick to flee ; in two days , many RJR bonds lost $200 for each $1,000 of face value . <P> Stocks have been slammed too . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich , a publishing company that borrowed $2.1 billion last May to repel a takeover attempt by British tycoon Robert Maxwell , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 just since Jan. 1 . Time Warner , which has nearly $11 billion in debt from Time Inc. ' s acquisition of Warner Communications , has seen its stock fall from 124 at the beginning of the year to 103 1/8 last week . The shares of Stone Container , a paper manufacturer that borrowed $2.2 billion to buy a Canadian competitor last March , have declined from 25 1/8 to 21 1/2 this year . Wall Street 's message is clear . During the ' 90s , companies are likely to pare down their debts and return to an old-fashioned way of raising money : by issuing stock .
