There 's one simple explanation for the triumph of capitalism over Soviet communism : we had Astaire and Marilyn ; all they had were boy-loves-tractor pictures . As the battle of the ideologies was fought on movie screens around the world , the edifying drabness of Soviet-bloc films could n't compete with America 's glamorous , sexy , lilting pop culture . As Dana Ranga , director of the terrific documentary East Side Story , puts it , " A specter was haunting communism : the specter of Hollywood . " <P> Now and then , Communist filmmakers tried entertaining the masses with what the official press derisively called " the most flagrant offspring of the capitalist pleasure industry " : musical comedies . East Side Story is the history of that glorious , doomed attempt to create an all-singing , all-dancing genre within the unsmiling dictates of socialist realism . <P> Some Commusicals did fit the stolid stereotype  --  Mikhail and Judit shouting , " Let 's harvest the beet crop right here ! "  --  but many have an enduring buoyancy . Grigori Alexandrov 's pioneering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cubist compositions and a Dietrichish blond in a party hat . The amazing Midnight Revue ( G.D.R. , 1962 ) is a comically cynical parable about the difficulty of making a musical when your producer is not Arthur Freed but a pack of philistine bureaucrats . We ca n't approve your film , the apparatchiks sing ; it 's " too hot ! " <P> This plot was no joke . Many Commusicals were censored for having a decadent Westernized tone . As an officious official bellows to a young dancer in Carnival Night ( U.S.S.R. , 1957 ) , " We want to raise the consciousness of our workers . But what do you expect to raise with naked legs ? " Only about 40 Soviet-bloc musicals were made in 40 years , from The Jolly Fellows to the glossy , ginchy No Cheating , Darling ( G.D.R. , 1973 ) . Yet these films brought vigorous fun to an audience starved for it . Their makers deserved to be named Heroes of the Soviet People . <P> Like Hitler , who insisted on a steady stream of musicals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the genre ; he saw Alexandrov 's Volga , Volga ( 1938 ) 100 times . And busy as he was in 1933 , supervising the forced starvation of 7 million Ukrainians , Stalin took time out to see The Jolly Fellows . It was his enthusiasm that overruled the censors ' original ban . <P> The only Soviet specialists in musicals were Alexandrov and Ivan Pyriev , the man who made the tractor movies . Pyriev 's peasants in Tractor Drivers ( 1939 ) sing , " With shellfire thundering and gleaming steel , / The machines will race ahead to lead the march . " In Alexandrov 's factory fantasy The Bright Path ( 1940 ) , workers sing , " Whether you work a machine or break through rocks/ A wonderful dream reveals itself and calls you forward . " Naive , yes , but ferociously pertinent for the Russian audience  --  propaganda in its noblest form . <P> The Russian musical died with Stalin , but the ' 50s and ' 60s saw a little bloom in Soviet-bloc musicals that were much more in step with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dapper gent figure-skating around a woman in her bedroom ( the Czech-East German The Wayward Wife ) , a DayGlo-bright production number in a spa ( Woman on the Rails , Czechoslovakia ) , a Bulgarian Connie Francis in full taunt ( The Antique Coin ) . But the syncopated clock was ticking ; Commusicals fizzled out , as Hollywood song shows did , in the early ' 70s.
