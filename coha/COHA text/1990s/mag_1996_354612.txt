ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL BOB DOLE depicts himself as the only man who can save the Grand Old Party from the divisive populism of Pat Buchanan . But Republican elders and lawmakers fear that Dole , the Senate leader and master tactician , is leaving them vulnerable back in Washington , where they stand to lose control of Congress if they do n't post some legislative accomplishments  --  and fast . <P> Dole has declined to step down from the majority leader 's post , which carries stature and affords him free television exposure as President Clinton 's foil on Capitol Hill , and he refuses to delegate more authority to his top deputy , majority whip Trent Lott . Now , though , the pressure on Dole is rising . Having lost the balanced-budget battle and becoming desperate to show voters what they stand for , Republican lawmakers return to Washington this week , after a three-week break , to find a Senate schedule devoid of anything except votes on funding the District of Columbia and the Whitewater investigation . Last week Dole 's staff was scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt ceiling , welfare reform and spending bills for a fiscal year that is already into its fifth month . Senators are grumbling that while Dole campaigns from Arizona to the Dakotas to South Carolina , he has not even given them a firm recess schedule that will allow them to plan their own re-election campaigns . <P> Lott has not so subtly agitated for more authority to run the Senate in Dole 's absence . He has told reporters , " I do like to get up on the horse and ride . " But Dole has never felt comfortable with his deputy 's obvious lust for the Senate 's top job , and has told friends he believes Lott mishandled parts of the telecommunications bill . A Dole ally describes Lott as a troublemaker who kicks up dust even when he stands still . Last Thursday , Lott finally offered the majority leader his endorsement for President  --  becoming the 38th Republican Senator to do so-but had trouble getting his call returned . <P>  --  By Karen Tumulty/Washington            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
