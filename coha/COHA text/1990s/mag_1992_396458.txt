With all the name-calling going on in the battle over wetlands , there 's still one question that remains unanswered . Wetland conservation at the federal level is a mess . Just about everybody deserves some blame , but hardly anyone seems set on what to do . Consequently , waterfowl and a host of other wildlife that depend on aquatic habitats may dwindle even further . Federal wetland protection is multifaceted . Acquisition is a primary form of protecting wetland habitat . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses money from several sources , including duck stamp sales , to buy ( and lease ) wetlands and other areas for the National Wildlife Refuge System . However , there are other ways . The Swampbuster Program in the U.S. Agriculture Department withholds subsidies from farmers who convert wetlands to cropland , in hopes that landowners would rather have the money than more cropland . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation conduct small but welcomed wetland restoration efforts . The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management try to protect and restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of public land that they manage . The potential of these relatively noncontroversial programs far exceeds that of the so-called 404 Permit Program . Yet , 404 is the crucible in which wetland conservation currently is being crushed and demeaned. " 404 " alludes to a section of the 1972 Clean Water Act in which Congress required that anyone seeking to deposit fill material in a wetland get a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers . Congress gave the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) veto power over Corps permits and exempted all normal agriculture and forestry activities from the permit requirement . The only problem with all of this was that Congress did n't define a wetland , and thus the strife ignited . At best , experts say , 404 can protect no more than 20 percent of the nation 's remaining wetlands . That is because the program regulates only filling of wetlands . Permits are not required for draining , flooding , burning , plowing , poisoning , bombing or any other destructive activity in wetlands . All this is somber indeed , considering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fish and Wildlife Service at more than a quarter-million acres annually . And about half of U.S. wetlands have already been drained . Fires under the boiling wetland pot seem to be fueled by a combination of judgment lapse , economics , misunderstanding and bad journalism . A few field people with the EPA , the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps of Engineers reportedly used poor judgment and required permits for minor activities on some very questionable areas . There are stories of homeowners wanting to add a room to their house and being delayed because the construction would be over a low , wet place in their yard . There reportedly were developers who wanted to fill and build on obvious wetlands , thereby turning inexpensive marsh into valuable property . Those businessmen resented the government foiling their assumed right to do as they pleased with their speculative property . Lathered by a flood of misinformation from agriculture organizations , farmers were led to believe that cropland was regulated by the program . That misunderstanding forced them to react negatively to a non-problem . Hip-shooting journalists have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Forbes magazine incorrectly stated that more than a million acres of Maryland had been labeled " wetland " by out-of-control agencies . The Forbes article is wrong . The fact is that the million acres in question do have wet soils , but they all do not qualify as wetlands , and thus have not been delineated as regulated wetlands . Agencies directly concerned with wetlands  --  namely , the Corps of Engineers , EPA , Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Soil Conservation Service  --  decided to define wetlands so that they could delineate areas covered by 404 . The result was the 1989 Wetland Delineation Manual . That document , developed by scientists , does not require an area to show standing water at any particular time for it to be labeled a wetland . Rather , three criteria are used to determine if an area indeed is a wetland . The " wetness , " or hydrology , test calls for saturated soils 18 inches below the surface for seven consecutive days during the year . Then there must be evidence of hydric soils . Lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty visualizing a wetland with no water in it . However , the fact is that many prairie potholes vital to waterfowl production may hold standing water only a few weeks a year each spring and early summer . A pothole harboring duck broods in May and June could be an alkali depression in October . That is why someone assessing those potholes in the late summer and fall must use criteria other than visible water . The manual is somewhat presumptuous on the hydrology issue in that all areas would not be monitored sufficiently to determine if the water table stays within 18 inches of the soil surface for seven days running annually . The cost of such massive tests are prohibitive . Determining if soils are hydric is relatively easy , though the definition of such soil is somewhat complicated . In essence , hydric soil is that which is wet a lot of the time and consequently is deprived of oxygen and organisms that require oxygen to live . Hydrophytic vegetation simply means cattails , tupelo gum and other plants that thrive in wet areas . The 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that soils met the hydrology criterion if they were hydric and hydrophytic vegetation was present . Consequently , only two criteria were required in reality . The manual , by no means perfect , was and is considered the best tool of its kind . It was used in the 404 Program as the first stage in a two-stage process of identifying wetlands and then protecting those wetlands that society believes are valuable for public purposes . Although the manual did a fair job , scientists continued their efforts to improve it . But the regulatory stage of the two-stage process did n't work so well , despite the wails of development interests . It denied only 3 to 4 percent of around 15,000 permits requested annually for filling wetlands . Thus , an estimated 290,000 acres of wetlands continue to be lost every year . Still , this laxity did n't satisfy developers or farm groups . They fired at the White House and Congress until the president 's men and appropriation committees grounded the 1989 manual . The White House edited the document drastically and proposed a completely unworkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the 1989 wetland manual . The White House proposal would require that all three criteria ( hydrology , hydric soils and hydrophytic plants ) be documented . Agencies could not assume , as they did under the 1989 manual , that the hydrologic standard ( " wetness " criterion ) is met if hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation are found . In effect , the proposed manual would ensure that wetlands could not be delineated . Even the national debt is n't big enough to finance people hanging around all of the nation 's wetlands for several years to see how long the water table is close to the soil surface periodically . Thus , the manual is virtually useless for mapping many important wetland types . House and Senate wildlife subcommittees held hearings on the issue during November 1991 . Scientists from around the country testified that the White House proposal was completely unworkable . They noted that some of the nation 's well-known wet areas ( part of the Florida Everglades , Virginia 's Great Dismal Swamp and San Francisco Bay marshes ) would not be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of natural resource science and wetland expert at the University of Rhode Island , told the Senate subcommittee that " wetland hydrology can not be accurately characterized or directly verified ; therefore , the mandatory three-criteria approach is neither reasonable nor practicable . " He suggested that hydrologic evidence not be required at all to delineate wetlands . The hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation criteria is sufficient , he said . Witnesses supporting the White House proposal represented real estate developments , farmers and oil companies , as might be expected . Any wetland definition that omits areas to be regulated naturally is preferred by those with economic interests that profit from wetland destruction . Although normal farming operations are exempt from 404 regulation , some farm groups are radically opposed to the program . The North Carolina Farm Bureau testified in the House that 404 is a " burden " to farmers . How so was not explained . Hawking the well-worn " gim me " line of some ag groups , the Bureau recommended that Congress give farmers " incentives " to protect wetlands on their property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do the right thing . " There is something perverse about the rationale of some interests toward wetlands . It declares that government protection of wetlands on private property is a " taking " for which the owners must be compensated . Stated simply , the argument is , " If the public wants to protect my wetlands to raise ducks , it should pay me , or else I should be permitted to do as I please . " An obvious problem with this contention is that wetlands are n't just for ducks . Wetlands also trap chemicals washing off farmland , reduce downstream flooding , hold soil eroding from cultivated fields , recycle nutrients from farms and lawns , and recharge ground water supplies . So , the Farm Bureau says that the public does not have the right to prohibit wetland destruction on private land without paying the landowner . Well now , does the farmer have the right to eliminate a wetland and thereby release pesticides , fertilizer , cow manure , floodwater and silt into public waterways ? Of course not . The Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been out in the weeds on this issue , also . An early highlight of the President 's agenda was to initiate a " no net loss " wetland protection effort . That goal clashes mightily with the White House proposed delineation manual , which would remove an estimated 100 million acres of wetlands from 404 protection . The November 1991 congressional hearings on the White House proposal turned many congressmen and senators against the document . The parade of scientists at those inquiries deftly ripped the proposal to bits and exposed its anti-wetland protection intent . With other domestic issues causing the administration intense pain at the moment , White House staffers may begin to backtrack on this issue . Administration officials started distancing themselves from the wetland definition proposal recently by assuring reporters that the document will be revised to reflect the president 's 1988 campaign pledge of no net wetland loss . The switch came only after government scientists field-tested the proposed manual and concluded that it would lift protection from half of the nation 's existing wetlands . According to the Army Corps of Engineers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the definition proposed by the administration . House wildlife subcommittee chairman Rep. Gerry Studds ( D-MA ) called the proposal and field study results " breathtaking . " Studds concluded , " Since the country was rounded 200 years ago we have lost about half of our wetlands . Now , with a single stroke of the pen , the White House is proposing to define away half of what we have left . " The federal official who helped develop the White House wetland manual told The New York Times reporter Phil Hilts that " what we have seen from the field data clearly shows that what we must do is go back to the table and begin a serious review of the manual . " Perhaps during the second go-round on the entire wetlands issue , White House staffers will listen to the Environmental Protection Agency , Fish and Wildlife Service , Army Corps of Engineers and others knowledgeable about wetlands . That could save the president further embarrassment in this election year . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
