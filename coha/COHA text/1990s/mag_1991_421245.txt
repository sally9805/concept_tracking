<p> KAREN AND JOHN WINSLOW BOTH COMPLETE THE PAINTINGS IN THE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT OF A VERMONT STUDIO , BUT JOHN PREFERS TO FIRST RESOLVE THE PICTURES THROUGH OIL SKETCHES HE PAINTS OUTDOORS , WHILE KAREN MAKES ALL DECISIONS WITH THE SUBJECT SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER . <p> Once Karen has a still-life setup and the canvas before her , she seeks the rhythms , the large masses , and the shapes and their relationships and then begins painting very loosely . In this way , she is not committed to a particular composition and is not afraid to change the painting . <p> Artists talk about using a variety of resources as they create their paintings , sometimes referring to such intangibles as memory and imagination and at other times talking about specifics such as photographs , drawings , Old Master paintings , and training . The point is that ' any and all of these resources can be aids to improving skills and developing , a unique personal style . The challenge facing artists is to learn about a variety of methods so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> John and Karen Winslow , a husband and wife who live in rural Vermont , rely on two different approaches to studio painting that allow them to respond in a thoughtful , organized manner to what they observe in nature . They use sketches made outdoors , amidst the ever-changing conditions of nature , as well as those of subjects sitting directly in front of them in the controlled environment of their studio . The combination helps them create landscapes and still-life oil paintings . <p> Both John and Karen studied at the Art Students League in New York City with Frank Mason , who greatly influenced them . Karen says , " Mason was just a wonderful painter and teacher who had a broad scope of work . With still lifes , interiors , portraits , landscapes , and seascapes , he could seemingly do anything . He taught us how to convey a spatial relationship , or rhythms or forms in space with atmosphere , while focusing on the effects of light . Once you have learned how to do that , you can paint anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karen Winslow is known chiefly for her still lifes and paintings of domestic life . " I mainly paint still lifes and interiors because I 'm a mother and work at home , " she explains . " When I 'm in the studio , which is attached to the house , I 'm more accessible to the children than if I 'm outside painting , a landscape , so I do few landscapes . " Happily , however , she can sometimes paint a picture that incorporates most of her interests . " Right now , " she says , " I 'm working on a picture of my children swinging back and forth in a hammock . I stood out in our yard while they were all laughing and playing and having a wonderful time , and I was able to make a very fast plein-air oil sketch . In fact , " she notes with a smile , " anyone seeing me start a painting would be quite surprised to learn that I am a realist painter . " <p> Initially , her paintings almost look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by considering placement , size , spatial relationships , and rhythms . " It 's always best to start your painting in a loose manner , " she declares . " In this way , you do not get committed too early to a particular composition and you 're not afraid to make changes once you have chosen one . <p> " Frank Mason always spoke of drawing with the brush , " she adds . " If you start out with something totally precise and say , This is where that line will be , ' you might hesitate to make changes . You can end up with something pretty terrible , even more so if the initial drawing was off . That 's why I like to work wet-on-wet , " she adds . " It leaves me free to modify things , to improve rhythms or forms , to keep changing and correcting . It keeps me thinking . " <p> Karen first focuses on the large masses , keeping the process nebulous , as though , to use her analogy , she were seeing the subject through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , " she states . " This way you can change or remove elements , emphasize rhythms , work in light and dark masses , and bring things forward and push others away . Starting with this approach often pays off in the end . I ca n't tell you how satisfying it is when people look at a completed work of mine and say something like , I could reach right behind that apple and pick it up . ' " <p> To Karen , a solid underpainting is crucial . As she moves out of the middle tones , she uses her whole scale of tones , massing , redrawing , revising , and unifying until she has five major planes : general light , general shadows , highlights , accents , and reflected light . Then she brings up the lights and works the darks until skit is satisfied that her objects appear natural and three-dimensional . Once the underpainting has been established , Karen leaves it alone for a day or two . The passage of time gives her an opportunity to rethink and review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazes and accents that enhance the effects and unify the overall painting . <p> " The painting should work as a gestalt , ' " she declares . " Color , craftsmanship , and emotion should come together in a harmonious statement  --  with the whole appearing greater than the sum of its , parts . " <p> Needless to say , Karen 's deep insights are not the result of an overnight revelation . She began drawing and painting as a child and was keenly interested in in art in high school , where she met her future husband . " John was taking art classes and gave me a set of watercolors , " she recalls . " That turned my mind to becoming a professional artist . My parents thought my decision came a little out of the blue  --  perhaps because they had never visited a museum . But when the love of painting strikes , nothing can stop it : Art is something you follow through your heart , something you want to do the rest of your life . " <p> In high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be wiser if she went into the more pragmatic byways of art . They encouraged her to study illustration and advertising design at a two-year college , after which she began working for dress-pattern companies , mainly rendering the illustrations for the covers of packets of children 's dress patterns . <p> In a search for something more fulfilling , Karen soon returned to art school . The search ended in November 1973 , when she attended a major solo show of Frank Mason 's work at the National Arts Club in New York City . " My husband , who was already in Mason 's class , had said , You must see this show ! ' So I did , and afterwards I thought , This is what I want to do . ' I immediately enrolled in Frank 's class at the Art Students League , " she reminisces . <p> One of the major effects of Mason 's classes on Karen was her choice of palette , which is oriented toward the cadmium colors . She arranges her palette in the following order : titanium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yellow ochre ; cadmium orange ; cadmium red light , medium , and deep ; alizarin crimson ; cobalt blue ; ultramarine blue ; raw and burnt umber , and ivory black . Sometimes she adds rose madder and cerulean blue . In addition , she uses a gray scale to preserve her color values  --  to keep her pitch and tonal values on key . <p> " I think of values all the time I 'm painting , " Karen explains . " My gray scale gives me value perspective and tells me how to place something behind or in front of a space to create a sense of atmosphere . I start my paintings with middle values  --  between white and black on my gray scale . Then I work up and down from there , incorporating ; the full scale of values . A value perspective is a very powerful tool . " <p> She uses her understanding of values most effectively ! to render light on a canvas . Whether painting a still life , an interior , or . a landscape , Karen believes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key factors in her work . " An artist is really trying to create an illusion of space , " she explains . " It 's almost a game , and it can be great fun . By using light , form , and movement , you can make objects appear to project from the picture into the room or recede further into the background of the painting . I want to convey the feeling that the viewer could place his or her hand right inside the picture , into a three-dimensional space . " <p> Karen has several preferences concerning the art supplies on her worktable . Round bristle brushes are her favorites . Kept in a large can , they include large , small , and many medium sizes . She also has some thin round sables and filberts . She begins a painting with a No. 9 or 10 round , but , because her paintings tend to be small in size , she does not use very large brushes except on an occasional oversize canvas . <p> In the end , the hardest part for Karen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is knowing when to stop . She sates , " When I 've gone as far as I can without destroying or overworking the painting I consider it finished . The hardest thing is knowing when you 've reached that point . Overworking is probably the greatest pitfall for an artist . If you push too far , you can get a hard-boiled egg instead of a good painting . You want a painting to look fresh and effortless . " <p> Once she decides the painting is done , John varnishes and frames it for her . In fact , he does the framing for all of her work . As he points out with a smile , " It gives me a break from my own painting since I do n't have to think quite so hard . " JOHN WINSLOW <p> Speaking to John Winslow , you quickly realize that both he and his wife spend a good deal of time thinking about the craft of painting . Unlike his wife , however , John grew up surf rounded by canvases and paint tubers since painting had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing pictures and working with clad as a child , began to consider a career in art while in high school . <p> Following his discharge from the navy in 1970 , John and Karen got married and , together , they enrolled at the Art Students League . After completing his studies in 1978 , John went to work for a company specializing in computer sculpture . Despite the fact he enjoyed the work John longed to return to fine art . left the company , bought a house from his brother in Cambridge , Vermont . <p> Each of his landscape paintings begins as a 12 " - x- 16 " oil sketch on panel . If a subject calls for more detail , he 'll also make a careful graphite drawing . When a scene especially appeals to him , he ' do several sketches at different times . Larger paintings are then completed in his studio from these studies . " It 's impractical to do a 3 ' - x- 4 ' painting outdoors , " John points but . " I suppose I could  --  if I worked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , laughing . " My instinct is to charge right in and get going , but I force myself to think first . Landscapes are fluid , changing every minute , so you have to decide early on how that painting will look and their work to achieve it . Where , for instance , are the borders of my painting ? Where will I want the viewer 's eye to focus ? Where will the horizon line be ? " <p> After he comes up with these answers , John mates a few marks with an earth tone such as raw umber in order to indicate where the basic compositional outlines will be . From that point , he usually works from the background toward the foreground . He begins with the sky , or , if he is doing a still-life composition , the wall behind the arrangement . <p> " Values are brighter nearer the sun , " John notes . " It 's like a lamp on the wall : The objects nearer the lamp will be stronger in hue . This is the same in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colors so that greens drop out or turn blue in the distance and distant mountains get more violet the closer they are to the sun and bluer the farther away they are from it . I might paint a cloud white , but if a building closer to the viewer is twice as bright as the clouds , I 'll paint the clouds gray to maintain a distinction between the two . " <p> With the composition settled and the most distant background elements in place , John next masses the middle tones . If he is painting a tree , for instance , he has a general sense not only of the tree , but also of the brighter points where the sun strikes it and of the deep shadows under the branches or behind the trunk . " At that point , " John says , " I establish the anatomy of the tree and begin dividing the blocked-in halftones into their specific parts . Although I like to paint a tree thoroughly , I want to do so without producing an inventory of every leaf . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , to keep things very , very simple . Balancing these two objectives is as tricky as walking a tightrope . It is difficult to make sure you 're not overdoing the details , while at the same time preventing your painting from looking unfinished and sketchy . " <p> Like many of his teachers , John uses a cadmium palette , running the gamut from the palest yellow to the deepest reds and oranges . His palette also includes yellow ochre ; alizarin crimson ; cerulean , cobalt , and ultramarine blues ; raw umber ; and ivory black . He grinds many of his paints in cold-pressed oil , trying to be as traditional as possible and avoiding anything synthetic . <p> " I usually premix a lot of paint for plein-air painting , " he explains . " If I 'm going to paint a landscape , I mix a string of greens from light yellow down to an umber tone , which I use as a springboard , and then I mix whatever other colors local conditions dictate . However , premixing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the most part , John uses round brushes , although he has recently begun using some of the larger brights ; hi relies on small sables for detail work . He prefers natural-bristles . He begins with large brushes , some as much as four inches across , for large paintings or when doing a large area , such as a sky . " A small brush just ca n't get the smooth progression of color possible with a large one , " John says . " You develop a certain feeling in handling brushes and paint , and you get to know how the various support surfaces act in different weather . " <p> Wherever possible , John prepares his own canvases and panels with a ground of white lead or gesso , over which he applies a sizing of rabbitskin glue mixed with a light pigment tone . " When painting outdoors , it 's almost impossible to start with a white canvas , " he explains . " It 's too bright and blinding . I always paint a brown or gray tone on the canvas before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern paints such as acrylics , he favors the new kinds of varnishes . " Winsor &; Newton 's Griffn and Winton varnishes work fine for me , " he declares . ' These new synthetic varnishes are wonderful . I like them because they give a nice even finish , whether gloss or satin . In addition , they can be cleaned easily without disturbing the glazes . " <p> That feature , as he points out , is very important to conservators  --  and to collectors , whose paintings must be cleaned from time to time . " If a varnish ca n't be removed , " John comments , " restorers employ increasingly stronger solvents , often with disastrous results . Such solvents may remove veils of delicate glazes and de ? stroy depth , luminosity , and mystery , leaving the artwork scrubbed down to the underpainting . <p> When the nineteenth-century Impressionist painters took their easels out into the landscape and began working directly from nature , they revolutionized the way artists create pictures . From that point onward , a clear distinction was drawn between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do , John and Karen Winslow take advantage of the best parts of these two approaches to oil painting as they create their beautifully composed works . <p> Currently , the Winslows are represented by three galleries : Gallery 2 in Woodstock , Vermont ; Gallery North Star in Grafton and Stratton , Vermont ; and the Loring Gallery in Cedarhurst , New York . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : White Rose , by Karen Winslow , 1987 , oil , 12 3/4 .
