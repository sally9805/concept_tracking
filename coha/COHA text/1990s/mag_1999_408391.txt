" It 's been a good career , from the early days at Archie Bray , when my wife Lela and I were young people working in clay and learning our craft , to my teaching days at the University of Montana . We were faced with new ideas in clay , most of which were homegrown . It was equally challenging to set up a curriculum forteaching ceramic art at a time when things were changing quickly . Ceramics became popular , and the faculty establishment was nervous about the tail wagging the dog . In time , clay art became fashionable because the benefits of a clay program gave back to the art world as much as other disciplines . " I am proud of what the Council , the staff at American Craft magazine and the leaders of the American Craft Museum have done over the years , nurturing and giving credibility to this branch of the arts . My thanks to all who have worked for it so generously .

I walk the endless shoreline daily to connect with that part of myself that is without end . My childhood was spent with my Sicilian father , a commercial fisherman , off the coasts of California and Mexico .

" My intent is to construct a vessel or related objects using materials respectfully harvested from nature . Nature 's variety-including fine fern stems and heavy chunks of wood , bark or stoneprovides a rich cache of supplies , often almost overpowering in stimulation and opportunity for design . My processes include traditional weaving techniques and experimentation . Small needles and power tools in the studio enable me to create two-inch miniatures and pieces so feet long . Some works can be made in half an hour , and others are planned , grown , cut and constructed over a period of years . The result may be an ephemeral or an archival work . The unique properties I find in gathered materials suggest a process for each piece .

But when I discovered quiltmaking in the 1970s , there was no turning back . I lost interest in weaving overnight and began buying fabrics and trying to figure out how to sew shapes together . I love cutting cotton fabric freely into shapes and lines , and then in a rhythmic manner machine-piecing the parts together . Piecing for me is a form of meditation . Touching , feeling , buying , owning , dyeing , painting , printing , cutting , sewing cotton fabrics is what I must do .

Honorary Fellow FRED MARER A resident of Los Angeles , Fred Marer is acknowledged as patron and collector extraordinaire of contemporary ceramics , particularly those of the West Coast . Marer was a mathematics professor at Los Angeles City College when he became interested in ceramics in the mid-1950s , the period when Peter Voulkos , Paul Soldner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otis Art Institute carrying out what came to be called a " revolution in clay . " Marervisited them in the studio at Otis , querying them about their work and before long became their friend , purchasing their work early in their careers , when they most needed support . After the Otis group dispersed , Marer continued to acquire ceramics , usually from artists he knew personally , and his collection grew to include more than 1,5oo works , a remarkable feat for a person of modest means . Through Soldner , who after he left Otis built the ceramics program at Scripps College , Clarement , Marer developed a connection to the school . Over 25 years , he gave portions of the collection to Scripps through long-term loan and donations , and by the 198os , the bulk of it was housed there and made accessible to students and others interested in ceramics . Most of the core collection of zoo works of the Otis group was given to Scripps in 1992 by Marer and his second wife , Estelle . These works have been documented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Marer Collection of Contemporary Ceramics , " at Montgomery Gallery , Pomona College , in 1984 , and " Revolution in Clay : The Marer Collection of Contemporary Ceramics , " at the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery , Scripps College , in 1994 . In June 200 , an exhibition of 8o pieces from the collection will be shown at the Ariana Museum , Geneva , Switzerland . In a tribute to Fred Marer , Peter Voulkos has said , " He was instrumental in confirming the careers of countless artists through friendship and financial support . I personally owe him a debt of gratitude and thanks . The Marer spirit of collecting , based on friendship and personal preference , will remain fixed in the collection , now at Scripps College . It is a repository of four decades of ceramic art history and knowledge attesting to the Marers ' substantial contribution to the development of ceramic art in America .

The ceramists working there in the early decades were known for producing a distinctive blue-glazed ware in the Arts and Crafts style , winning national prizes and garnering commissions , many through the contacts of Maude Robinson , director of the pottery from 1911 to 1941 . After World War II , under the leadership of Jane Hartsook , who was director from 1945 to 1982 , the pottery expanded and shifted focus , reflecting the expressive potential artists were exploring in ceramics in that period . Hartsook 's invitations to teach , give workshops or exhibit opened up possibilities for many . Among the pottery 's best-known teaching alumni , to name but a few , have been Peter Voulkos , Rudy Autio , Betty Wood man , James Makins , Robert Turner and the late Margaret Israel , who taught there from 1958 to 1987 . In its well-equipped studios located in a threestory brick building at 16 Jones Street , Greenwich House Pottery offers instruction in ceramics yearround to all age groups and skill levels as well as residencies providing artists with free materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now bears her name-workshops and lectures by established and emerging artists are offered regularly .
