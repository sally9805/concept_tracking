THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MET ONE LAST DEADline  --  kind of , barely . Officials had said they hoped to at least begin a pullout from Somalia before Bill Clinton 's Inauguration . Lo and behold , in the final hours of the Bush presidency about 1,100 Marines were beginning to come home . Besides redeeming Bush 's pledge , the move was clearly intended to prod the United Nations to hurry up in creating a regular peacekeeping force to take over from the U.S.-led ad hoc troops . American Marine Colonel Fred Peck , a military spokesman in Mogadishu , hopefully suggested that U.S. troops could begin to pass authority to the U.N . as early as Feb. 1 . <P> Fat chance . Creation of a force can not start until the Security Council passes an authorizing resolution , and no drafts are yet circulating . Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has discussed with some U.N . members possible troop contributions to a force that might exceed 20,000 . But he has had only perfunctory contacts with President Clinton 's advisers , and no one seems to be discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under what circumstances the peacekeepers could shoot . So the 25,000 U.S. and 12,000 other foreign troops remaining in Somalia may be stuck for weeks or months , and their duty remains hazardous . Last week Chief Warrant Officer Gus Axelson of the U.S. Marines took a bullet in the right shoulder while riding in a convoy in Mogadishu . He was the third U.S. military man wounded ; one has been killed .
