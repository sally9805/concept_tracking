In this column , which takes an intimate look at diverse cultures , a father compares his daughter 's American childhood with his own upbringing in a southern Nigerian village , where life held much fascination By Minabere Ibelema Photograph // WHAT DID YOU GET for your seventh birthday ? " my then-6-year-old daughter , Boma , asked me some time ago . She often asked such probing questions of her West African father , but this time she was more than merely curious . Her seventh birthday was cascading down the calendar and , seeking an angle for persuasion , she wanted to compare notes with Daddy : You see , you got a moped for your seventh birthday , so I should get a computer . But she did n't get that far . My answer precluded it . " I did n't get anything for my seventh birthday , " I told her . " Nothing ? " Boma said , incredulous . " Nothing , " I repeated . " But why , Daddy ? " she asked plaintively , her eyes searching my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you ? " As she stared glumly at me , she seemed to be wondering at the deprived childhood her father must have suffered . I realized that I had not done enough to acquaint her with my life growing up in a Niger Delta village in southern Nigeria in the 1960 's . How different my childhood had been from hers , and how joyful nonetheless ! " It 's okay , my dear , " I said to halt her deepening anguish . I then explained that where Daddy grew up , birthdays came and went unheralded , and that at any given time we were as likely as not to know how old we were . We tended to seek the information only in support of jocular claims of seniority among playmates , and we would scurry home and ask our parents to confirm our best estimates . Often our parents were n't sure , either . Those who could read would pore through their official documents ; others would check with relatives who had better memories . " So you see , " I finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boma 's face brightened somewhat , but she was still perplexed . She could n't imagine a child growing up without birthday observances and gifts . As with most American children , the anniversary of her birth is her most cherished day . She begins a countdown as soon as one celebration is over , and starts canvassing for gifts months in advance . She can generally count on clothes , Barbies and stuffed animals from Mommy and Grandma . I usually give her something practical , such as a bike , a spelling-bee toy , a personalized calendar-nothing lavish , but enough to explain her dismay at the news that her father got no birthday gifts as a child . As she sat recovering from the shock , Boma could not have imagined that her sympathy for me was reciprocated . Whenever I 'd watched her strain to entertain herself with Barbie-doll mothering , TV watching and playhouse decorating , I 'd always had the nagging feeling that she was growing up deprived , without the social richness I luxuriated in as a child . I felt sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncles , aunts , nieces , nephews and cousins , and in a complex of apartments where playmates were in short supply . I often reminisced about my own childhood in the Niger Delta . We had no store-bought toys , TVs or radios , and certainly no Nintendos . But an uncle owned an RCA gramophone and a few 78-rpm singles , which he played some evenings for a roomful of appreciative youngsters still covered with dust from the playground . That was it for entertainment gadgetry , yet boredom was not in our vocabulary . Each day , as soon as we had completed our assigned chores-sweeping dirt yards , fetching water to fill large clay pots and iron drums , cleaning shellfish and , for those of us who attended school , doing homework-we were free to roam . Playmates were plentiful , and our playground was wide-ranging . There were no predators , human or animal , to fear . We sometimes worried about ghosts and evil spirits , but they never hurt us . Occasionally an elder would snap some twigs and rattle the legs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never bothered us , either . We spent our days wading through swampy shores and creeks , fishing the surrounding waters . We picked fruits from bushes and chased birds and giant land crabs . We formed kiddie social clubs and staged masquerade displays , fashioning steel drums from empty cans and rumbling out discordant beats as we imitated ceremonial dance steps . On brilliant moonlit nights , we stayed up late playing hide-and-seek , while waiting for ripe mangoes to fall . Not even the treachery of tree stumps that routinely devastated our bare toes could keep us from the excitement of ordinary thingsan empty Ovaltine can rigged with rubber and board to make a crab trap , which snapped shut when the bait was pulled . Just as we designed it ! When , a few summers ago , I took Boma to Universal Studios ' theme park in Orlando , we rode the Time Travel machine with its breathtaking virtual-reality displays . As dinosaurs raged and planets collided , I thought that here , at last , was a technology that could replicate for my daughter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could find the zillion dollars to pay Hollywood wizards to re-create it . But then I wondered , would Boma sense the excitement I experienced as a child ? I 'm sure she would n't mind the freedom to roam with other children , but would she find joy in adult mimicry such as pouring libations with Coca-Cola and then sharing a pint-size drink among a dozen salivating mouths ? I 've finally stopped asking these questions , content that Boma-who turned 13 on her last birthday-is finding fulfillment in her world and time . Brandy and Coolio music videos excite her as much as sabertoothed masqueraders and talking drummers once enthralled me . And just as I roamed my village late into the night , playing with other children , Boma wanders in cyberspace , chatting with peers from across the globe . She has already read many more books than I read all through high school , and she has learned far more about plants and animals than I did , although I grew up in proximity to a greater variety of both . And she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about life in Nigeria , I said to my daughter , " You know , Daddy would not trade his childhood for yours . And you probably would n't trade yours for his . So from now on , no more sympathies . " Boma nodded and smiled .
