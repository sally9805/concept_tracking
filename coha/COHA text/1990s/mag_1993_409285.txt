When the horticultural writer Lee Reich announced this spring that he was going to grow a patch of wheat in his garden in the Hudson Valley , it was a piece of real boldness . Normally , no one would have been particularly surprised or impressed if the author had revealed that he intended to make a pencil bloom . But even Reich realized that wheat was a special kind of undertaking , even for a big-time green thumb like himself . He wrote : I already have two excuses ready in case of poor yields . First , I am planting wheat in spring . But best wheat yields are obtained where wheat is grown as a winter crop . Winter wheat is sown in late summer , grows through autumn until put to sleep by winter cold , then begins growing again by early spring , ripening its seed heads by late spring . The other inherent limitation in my wheat harvest will be my choice of variety . I intend to go to the local health food store and buy a handful of whatever wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , many varieties of wheat  --  not surprising for a plant that was cultivated in the Nile Valley 9,000 years ago ! In America alone , more than 200 varieties are grown . Wheat 's relative rarity in the Northeast is only , as Reich says in the same column in the Huguenot Herald , a result of the far better growing conditions that exist elsewhere , farther west . But this is only part of what makes Reich 's wheat venture such a delicious self-dare . Even if he were living in Montana , he would be breaking fresh ground , as it were , for a gardener . Technically , wheat falls under the heading of horticulture as much as dahlias or lettuce . But in our day , growing Triticum aestivum is an industrial job . The world 's wheat crop is immense , but almost none of it is grown in gardens by individuals for home consumption . And because of advanced forms of storage and transportation , it has been possible to concentrate wheat production ( and the production of other fundamental grains ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . This means that the largest and most crucial part of world food production is now a transnational event run by giants . It also means that wheat is , in principle , available anywhere , at any time , instead of being a crop of limited range that gives way , in more challenging climates , to other staples . In the Old World , wheat was once rivaled by oats , barley , rye , and buckwheat . Today , these grains occupy special niches in the human diet . Some people barely consume them at all . And almost no one supplements industrially grown wheat with backyard garden wheat in the way that possibly millions of home gardeners supplement agribusiness 's tomatoes with their own vine-ripened crop . Perhaps Reich 's wheat will justify the effort . Perhaps his flour will taste better than anything he can buy , even from a custom miller , or better than flour he might mill himself with one of the milling machines available to hobbyists and other doubting Thomases of the health food fringe . Certainly , assuming that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know for whom words like reap , thresh , winnow , flail , and chaff have a direct meaning . This is a very odd state of affairs , considering how our lives are built on the hybrid grasses of the Triticum genus . The origins of wheat , and almost everything important to know about this useful plant , are buried in prehistory or hidden away in today 's mammoth fields and behemoth mills . The same could be said of all the other staple grains , but wheat is the pre-eminent case . Today , wheat ranks first in production totals among the world 's grains , and it accounts for more than 20 percent of the total calorie consumption of the human race . We know what we know about the origins of modern wheat ( and of other modern food grains ) in two ways : from genetic research and from that subsection of archeology called paleoethnobotany . Archeological fieldwork in this discipline is not outwardly glamorous . Like all archeology , it is a learned version of ditch-digging conducted in slow motion and in miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bone-chilling business pursued in caves colonized by chittering bats and hip deep with their guano . Human excrement is a central feature of paleoethnobotany because accidentally preserved feces , called coprolites , often contain traces of undigested food , particularly seeds . As Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf explain in Domestication of Plants in the Old World ( Oxford , 1988 ) : " when faeces are charred , desiccated , or waterlogged , they often contain numerous identifiable plant fragments , which indicate the content of the human food in the tested culture . " Zohary and Hopf cite the extraordinary example of several corpses pulled from Iron Age sites in Danish peat bogs . The corpses were so well preserved that it was possible to do a " detailed analysis of the last meals still contained in the stomachs . " Other sources of archeological data about plants include charred or carbonized plant remains ( sometimes including whole ears or entire caches of grain that were burned and then left undisturbed for thousands of years ) and imprints left on pottery , bricks , and plaster . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture in neolithic times , when human societies all over the world were switching from hunting and foraging to farming . Richard S. MacNeish surveys the current state of research in The Origins of Agriculture and Settled Life ( University of Oklahoma , 1991 ) . He begins by sketching the history of theories on the origin of agriculture . The outsider may be surprised at how much first-rate theorizing has been done about such an apparently straightforward development as agriculture . But the stakes are high : agriculture seems to go hand in hand with a settled life , in villages and then cities ; and a settled life is the main prerequisite for civilization . It matters greatly , then , exactly how the human race evolved from nomadic bands of illiterates into rooted agricultural settlers with the time and the societal need to keep records . Unfortunately , the physical evidence for this great shift  --  perhaps the most fundamental advance in human history  --  is thin and can be interpreted in many ways . Thus the temptation to theorize . As it happens , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views about how economic forces had prompted the shift from food collection to food production in prehistoric times . Both men refined their thinking and published it in its most complete form , quite separately , in 1951 . The British archeologist V. Gordon Childe believed that ( in MacNeish 's summary ) the fundamental event in the establishment of agriculture ... is the ending of the Pleistocene with its concomitant changing climate .... In the Near East , desiccation expanded the deserts , causing a concentration of plants , humans , and animals around a series of oases . Recognizing the food potential of the associated plants and animals , humans began to experiment with them . Their experimentation led to a new means of food production  --  agriculture ( i.e. , the planting of seeds ) . Associated with this shift was the Neolithic Revolution , characterized by sedentary village life , expanding population , the use of ground-stone tools , the development of ceramics , and the emergence of a new type of social ( and political ? ) organization . On the other side of the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out teams of colleagues all over the world to gather plant evidence to prove that increased population and new technology were the causes of settled agricultural life rather than the results of an environmental crisis . His greatest contribution was not , however , at this high theoretical level , but closer to the ground . His teams gathered an enormous amount of data , and Vavilov fitted that data into a framework of great influence . He concluded that , in MacNeish 's words , " areas with the greatest concentration of domesticated plant varieties were the " hearths " of domestication ; that is , the centers in which domestication was first practiced and from which all later use of domesticated plants and agriculture radiated and diffused . " Vavilov 's eight hearths were China , India , the Near East , highland Guatemala , the Andes , the Sudanic Abyssinian area , the South American tropics , and Southeast Asia . Vavilov and his followers believed that humans gravitated to these areas because of the abundance of edible plants growing there . The populations of well-fed , oasis-foraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet increased demand reliably . Vavilov 's life ended in tragedy , owing to his loyalty to mainstream botany and Mendelian genetics . Official Stalinist biology , under the leadership of Trofim Lysenko , rejected Mendelianism in favor of the principle of the heritability of acquired characteristics . Vavilov was sent to the Gulag , where he died in disgrace and became the leading martyr to Stalin 's repression of scientific thought . In the world at large , his ideas have been superseded , or at least significantly modified , in the light of later research in archeology and plant genetics . MacNeish , in his own trilinear theory , reduces the number of hearths  --  he calls them Centers  --  to four ( Near East , Far East , Meso-American , and Andes ) . And he believes that he can account for the rise of plant domestication and settled life in any given place with one of his three complex , multistage hypotheses . They all share three necessary conditions : potentially domesticable plants , a plantable environment , and the reduction of food resources because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself is careful to stress that his finely wrought structures are based on highly fragmentary evidence . But for those of us who stay at home and eat bread in late-twentieth-century cities , his hardheaded scenarios , tying together the domestication of wild grasses and the beginnings of urban life , are the raw material for vivid daydreams about our roots and the dawn of our culture . Harold Pinter 's play " The Birthday Party " introduced me to the idea of fried bread . And it was not a pretty introduction . As the play opens , an elderly couple are discussing breakfast in an aggressively dull and infuriating manner . She asks him if he liked his fried bread . " Was it nice ? " " Yes , very nice . " And so on and so on . Never having eaten fried bread , I assumed it was the epitome of bad British food , a corruption of taste consisting of limp white bread dripping rancid bacon fat . Then , one morning years later , I found myself with a pan of hot bacon grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried bacon to go with fried eggs at Saturday breakfast . ) And , remembering the Pinter play , I thought , why not try it ? Very nice white peasant bread was at hand . I sliced it and dropped a slice in the very hot bacon grease . It was golden brown in a second . Drained on paper towel , it was a most delicious thing . I made a few more . These days , I rarely try this adventure in high-fat , high-cholesterol dining , but once in a while it ca n't hurt . If you substitute goose fat for bacon fat , some nutritional experts will tell you that you have sidestepped the cardiovascular threat . With olive oil or one of the other non-artery-closing oils , you are safer , except for the calorie boost . Good cooking practice  --  very hot oil  --  will keep the grease level as low as possible . HEALTHFUL ( ? ) FRIED BREAD Sliced bread Oil or bacon drippings or goosefat or butter 1 . For best results , the first time you do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cast-iron skillet slightly larger than the bread slice . Fill it with least a quarter-inch of oil or melted fat . This may look repulsive as you begin , but you do n't want to be constantly replenishing the oil or fat especially because reliably hot temperature is the key to crisp success . Leftover oil or fat can be reused. 2 . Heat oil or fat just until it begins to smoke . I could list the smoke points of all the various oils and fats you might decide to use for this recipe , but this would inject a preposterous note of scientific precision into what is , after all , the most primitive sort of cooking , meant to use up old bread and the residue of bacon frying . The really important thing is to wait until the oil or fat is very hot , so that it will immediately seize the bread ( or " surprise " it , as the French say ) on contact and will not make it soggy . As soon as a vapor or " smoke " rises from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil or fat . Using tongs is the best way to avoid splashing 370-degree fat on yourself . 3 . The bread should sizzle loudly and brown almost immediately . Turn with the tongs . Cook for a few seconds more and remove to paper towel . If the bread burns right away , then the fat is too hot . Lower heat , wait a couple of minutes , and try again . It should not take much trial and error , if any , to get this process going . Continue until you have as many slices of fried bread as you need . As the level of the oil or fat reduces , take special care that the temperature does not rise too high . Variations : If you fry two or three garlic cloves in the oil ( and remove them when browned ) before you start frying the bread , the oil will impart a garlic flavor to the bread . This process is essentially the same as making croutons . Instead of using slices of bread , cut the bread in triangles or dice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a writer whose special interests are the history and preparation of food . <p>
