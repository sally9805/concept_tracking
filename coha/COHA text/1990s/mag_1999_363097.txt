It seems like a no-brainer . Call waiting has been around for more than a decade , so why does it slip into a coma when I 'm surfing the Web on my home computer and a friend tries to call me on the same line ? After all , a modem connection is just another phone call . But for all our high-tech wizardry , my friends still get a busy signal even if I 'm just deleting junk e-mail or downloading a song . I may get a little drowsy at the keyboard , but I can still multitask  --  if only my PC will let me . <P> Now I no longer have to choose between cyberlife and social life . Suddenly everybody is doing computer call waiting . This summer Actiontec became the first company to sell a call-waiting modem . And this fall software-only services are popping up everywhere . Callwave , Pagoo and Prodigy all offer programs you can download from their websites and use for up to $5 a month . In October MSN launched a $5-a-month , members-only service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide by March . Research firm IDC predicts that more than a quarter of U.S. households will use an Internet call-waiting service by the end of next year . <P> Last week I decided to see how well they answered the call . I had planned to upgrade my old 28.8-kbps modem anyway , so I tried Actiontec 's $130 56K call-waiting modem first . After a painless setup , I was online and ready for calls . This particular night , unfortunately , there did n't happen to be any . I finally had to call myself , using my roommate 's phone line . I was startled when the ringing came from the modem , not the phone . But I could still answer my phone and have a scintillating conversation with myself before hanging up and getting back online . I had to make it snappy , however , since the system gives me only 7 sec. before it takes the modem off line . Actiontec is working on a longer time frame , but do n't expect it anytime soon . <P> Next I tried Callwave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't . Like all the other software-only services , it requires you to sign up for a little-known option provided by most local phone companies called call forward on busy . This means that if your phone is busy , an incoming call is automatically forwarded to another number  --  for $1 to $3 a month , plus a one-time activation fee . ( In Manhattan it 's $16 plus $1.60 a month  --  hardly free . ) With Callwave , callers are forwarded to an 800 number that plays a canned greeting telling people you 're online and inviting them to leave a brief message . Like magic ( or so it seemed to me the first time I tried it ) , Callwave instantly sends you the message over the Net as a voice file , which you then play back through your PC speakers . A small banner on your screen alerts you to incoming calls and lets you store and delete messages . I tried the service several times , and it worked fine except for one problem : I could n't talk to anybody unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun to screen calls , but my friends report that the shameless self-promotion in Callwave 's voice-mail greeting gets tired really fast . <P> There 's another downside . I used to think I was missing lots of phone calls by spending so much time online . Now I have to face the fact that I 'm not as popular as I thought . Is n't technology great ? <P> For more on these products , you can visit
